Abstract: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with poor prognosis and high recurrence. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes oncogenesis by transcriptional activation of c-Myc and its downstream signals. EDAR is characterized as an important effector of canonical Wnt signaling in developing skin appendages, but the interplay between EDAR and Wnt signaling in tumorigenesis and progression remains to be elucidated. In this study, we revealed that EDAR expression is prevalently elevated in colorectal cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Further analysis suggests there is a strict correlation between EDAR expression and colorectal cancer progression. EDAR silencing by shRNA in colorectal cancer cells showed proliferative suppression via retarding cell cycle at G1 phase. Xenograft mice transplanted with shEDAR-transduced tumor cells significantly alleviated tumor burden in comparison with control mice. Furthermore, downregulation of EDAR was accompanied by reduction of β-catenin, c-Myc and other G1 cell cycle regulators, while β-catenin agonist restored the expression of these proteins and overrode the proliferative block induced by EDAR knockdown. These findings indicate that EDAR functions as a component of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and is a potential modulator in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Aims
Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) shuttle select MSC contents and are endowed with an ability to repair ischemic tissues. We hypothesized that exposure to cardiovascular risk factors may alter the microRNA cargo of MSC-derived EVs, blunting their capacity to repair the post-stenotic kidney in pigs with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and renal artery stenosis (RAS).
Methods
Porcine MSCs were harvested from abdominal fat after 16wks of Lean- or MetS-diet, and their EVs isolated and characterized using microRNA-sequencing. Lean- and MetS-EV protective effects were assessed in-vitro in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). To compare their in-vivo efficacy to repair ischemic tissues, allogeneic-EVs were intrarenally delivered in pigs after 6wks of MetS + RAS, and 4wks later, single-kidney renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied in-vivo, and microvascular architecture and injury ex-vivo. Lean-, MetS-, and MetS + RAS-sham served as controls (n = 6 each).
Results
Ten microRNAs, capable of targeting several pro-angiogenic genes, were upregulated in MetS-EVs versus Lean-EVs. In vitro, MetS-EVs failed to increase tube number and length, and to boost HUVEC migration compared to Lean-EVs. Lean- and MetS-EVs were detected in the stenotic-kidney 4wks after injection in the vicinity of small vessels. RBF and GFR were lower in MetS + RAS versus MetS, and restored in MetS + RAS + Lean-EVs, but not in MetS + RAS + MetS-EVs. Furthermore, MetS-EVs failed to restore renal expression of angiogenic factors, improve microvascular density, or attenuate fibrosis.
Conclusions
MetS alters the microRNA cargo of MSC-derived EVs and impairs their functional potency, limiting the therapeutic efficacy of this endogenous cellular repair system.

Abstract: Human class I homeobox A13 (HOXA13) was initially identified as a transcription factor and has an important role in embryonic development and malignant transformation. However, the clinical significance and the molecular mechanisms of HOXA13 in colon cancer development and progression are still unknown. In this study, we found that HOXA13 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and its expression was associated with histological grade, T stage, N stage and tumour size. In vitro studies showed that HOXA13 promoted colon cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that HOXA13 expression was positively correlated with the WNT signalling pathway. In vitro studies showed that HOXA13 promoted the malignant phenotype of colon cancer cells by facilitating the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin. Moreover, XAV939, an inhibitor of β-Catenin, reversed the HOXA13-mediated effects on invasion and proliferation of colon cancer cells. In vivo studies further verified that HOXA13 promoted tumour formation through the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that HOXA13 is a potential oncogene that functions by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, thereby maintaining the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer.

Abstract: 8-prenylgenistein (8PG) was previously reported to exert stronger osteogenic activity than genistein, a well-known soy phytoestrogen. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of 8PG on osteoblasts was far from clear. In the present study, the osteogenic effects and mechanisms of 8PG and genistein were studied using human BMSC and murine pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Our results indicated that the stimulatory effects of 8PG and genistein on osteoblast differentiation were abolished by co-incubation with MPP (10−6 M, an ERα antagonist), but not PHTPP (10−6 M, an ERβ antagonist). Molecular docking indicated that the binding mode of 8PG toward ERα was similar to that of genistein and therefore could not account for their differential osteogenic actions. In silico target profiling identified the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a key mediator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, in the actions of 8PG. However, instead of directly inhibiting GSK-3β enzymatic activities, 8PG and genistein were found to induce GSK-3β phosphorylation at Serine-9 in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. 8PG exerted more potent effects than genistein in stimulating expressions of LRP5, β-catenin, Runx2, osteocalcin, alp, opg, major protein and gene markers involved in Wnt signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, the inhibition of Wnt signaling by DKK1 could be restored by treatment with 8PG and genistein. However, 8PG, but not genistein, stimulated ERα-dependent β-catenin protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, the increase in ALP activity, LRP5 and phospho-Akt/Akt expression by 8PG and genistein were abolished by co-treatment with LY294002 (10−5 M, a PI3K pathway inhibitor). Collectively, our results suggested that the osteogenic activities of 8PG was mediated by GSK-3β phosphorylation through the induction of Wnt/β-catenin and ERα-associated PI3K/Akt signaling.

Abstract: Aberrant protein glycosylation is involved in many diseases including cancer. This study investigated the role of fucosyltransferase VII (FUT7) in the progression of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). FUT7 expression was found to be upregulated in FTC compared to paracancerous thyroid tissue, and in FTC with T2 stage of TMN classification compared to FTC with T1 stage. FUT7 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the migration and invasion of primary FTC cell line FTC-133. Consistently, FUT7 knock-down inhibited cell proliferation, EMT, as well as the migration and invasion of the metastatic FTC cell line FTC-238. Mechanistic investigation revealed that FUT7 catalyzed the α1,3-fucosylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in FTC cells. The extent of glycan α1,3-fucosylation on EGFR was positively correlated with the activation of EGFR in the presence/absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment. Furthermore, FUT7 was shown to enhance EGF-induced progression of FTC cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. These findings provide a new perspective on FUT7 that may be a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target of FTC.

Abstract: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a promising biomarker of cancer occurrence and development. The different expression levels of circRNAs in various cancers also make them possible therapeutic targets. In this work, we researched the function and underlying mechanisms of circ_0003340 (circ3340) in esophageal cancer EC1 and EC9706 cells. Firstly, we found the expression levels of circ3340 are higher in ESCC and two esophageal cancer cells than in adjacent normal tissues and Het-1a cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed circ3340 has a binding site with miR-564. This was verified by luciferase assay, which revealed that miR-564 can be sponged by circ3340, and that the TPX2 3′UTR is a direct target of miR-564. Upregulation of miR-564 decreased TPX2 protein levels, as shown by Western blot. Moreover, knockdown of circ3340 or enhancement of miR-564 expression had similar effects in EC1 and EC9706 cells, i.e., inducing cell apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and arresting cell invasion. Downregulation of circ3340 had a negative influence on EC1 and EC9706 cells by affecting the miR-564/TPX2 pathway. Additionally, animal experiments revealed that downregulation of circ3340 inhibited tumor growth in vivo, making circ3340 a potential therapeutic target for patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer.

Abstract: Adult kidney stem cells are known to have important roles in renal regeneration after acute kidney injury. Although trophic factors from tissue stem cells have been reported to promote the regeneration of other organs, there is limited number of evidence of this phenomenon in the kidneys. Here, we explored the effects of secreted factors from kidney stem cells. We intraperitoneally administered culture supernatant obtained from adult rat kidney stem/progenitor cells into rat kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury models, and the treatment significantly ameliorated renal tubulointerstitial injury, suppressed tubular cell apoptosis, diminished inflammation and promoted the proliferation of both residual renal cells and immature cells. In vitro, treatment with culture supernatant from kidney stem cells significantly promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis in both normal rat kidney cells and kidney stem cells. In addition, treatment with culture supernatant increased the expression of nestin in normal rat kidney cells, suggesting the dedifferentiation of tubular cells into stem-like cells. Analysis of the culture supernatant revealed that it contained a variety of growth factors. Taken together, the results suggest that these factors together lead to renal regeneration. In conclusion, adult kidney stem cells contribute to renal regeneration indirectly through the secretion of regenerative factors.

Abstract: Summary
Supplementation with members of the early-life microbiota as “probiotics” is increasingly used in attempts to beneficially manipulate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We performed a large observational longitudinal study comprising two preterm groups: 101 infants orally supplemented with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (Bif/Lacto) and 133 infants non-supplemented (control) matched by age, sex, and delivery method. 16S rRNA gene profiling on fecal samples (n = 592) showed a predominance of Bifidobacterium and a lower abundance of pathobionts in the Bif/Lacto group. Metabolomic analysis showed higher fecal acetate and lactate and a lower fecal pH in the Bif/Lacto group compared to the control group. Fecal acetate positively correlated with relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, consistent with the ability of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strain to metabolize human milk oligosaccharides into acetate. This study demonstrates that microbiota supplementation is associated with a Bifidobacterium-dominated preterm microbiota and gastrointestinal environment more closely resembling that of full-term infants.

Abstract: Summary
Over the past decade, wingless-activated (WNT) medulloblastoma has been identified as a candidate for therapy de-escalation based on excellent survival; however, a paucity of relapses has precluded additional analyses of markers of relapse. To address this gap in knowledge, an international cohort of 93 molecularly confirmed WNT MB was assembled, where 5-year progression-free survival is 0.84 (95%, 0.763–0.925) with 15 relapsed individuals identified. Maintenance chemotherapy is identified as a strong predictor of relapse, with individuals receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide or ifosphamide having only one very late molecularly confirmed relapse (p = 0.032). The anatomical location of recurrence is metastatic in 12 of 15 relapses, with 8 of 12 metastatic relapses in the lateral ventricles. Maintenance chemotherapy, specifically cumulative cyclophosphamide doses, is a significant predictor of relapse across WNT MB. Future efforts to de-escalate therapy need to carefully consider not only the radiation dose but also the chemotherapy regimen and the propensity for metastatic relapses.

Abstract: The proliferation and differentiation of myoblast cells are regulated by the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway. Although the regulation of FGFR signaling cascades has been widely investigated, the inhibitory mechanism that particularly function in skeletal muscle myogenesis remains obscure. In this study, we determined that LRTM1, an inhibitory regulator of the FGFR signaling pathway, negatively modulates the activation of ERK and promotes the differentiation of myoblast cells. LRTM1 is dynamically expressed during myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration after injury. In mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, knockout (KO) of Lrtm1 significantly prevents the differentiation of myoblast cells; this effect is associated with the reduction of MyoD transcriptional activity and the overactivation of ERK kinase. Notably, further studies demonstrated that LRTM1 associates with p52Shc and inhibits the recruitment of p52Shc to FGFR1. Taken together, our findings identify a novel negative regulator of FGFR1, which plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of myoblast cells.

Abstract: Imbalances of cellular proteostasis are linked to ageing and human diseases, including neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) and small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) together form a crucial core of the molecular chaperone family that plays a vital role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by shielding client proteins against aggregation and misfolding. sHSPs are thought to act as the first line of defence against protein unfolding/misfolding and have been suggested to act as “sponges” that rapidly sequester these aberrant species for further processing, refolding, or degradation, with the assistance of the HSP70 chaperone system. Understanding how these chaperones work at the molecular level will offer unprecedented insights for their manipulation as therapeutic avenues for the treatment of ageing and human disease. The evolution in single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, such as optical tweezers (OT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), over the last few decades have made it possible to explore at the single-molecule level the structural dynamics of HSPs and sHSPs and to examine the key molecular mechanisms underlying their chaperone activities. In this paper, we describe the working principles of OT and AFM and the experimental strategies used to employ these techniques to study molecular chaperones. We then describe the results of some of the most relevant single-molecule manipulation studies on HSPs and sHSPs and discuss how these findings suggest a more complex physiological role for these chaperones than previously assumed.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising technology for gene correction. However, the edition is often biallelic, and uncontrolled small insertions and deletions (indels) concomitant to precise correction are created. Mutation-specific guide RNAs were recently tested to correct dominant inherited diseases, sparing the wild-type allele. We tested an original approach to correct compound heterozygous recessive mutations. We compared editing efficiency and genotoxicity by biallelic guide RNA versus mutant allele-specific guide RNA in iPSCs derived from a congenital erythropoietic porphyria patient carrying compound heterozygous mutations resulting in UROS gene invalidation. We obtained UROS function rescue and metabolic correction with both guides with the potential of use for porphyria clinical intervention. However, unlike the biallelic one, the mutant allele-specific guide was free of on-target collateral damage. We recommend this design to avoid genotoxicity and to obtain on-target scarless gene correction for recessive disease with frequent cases of compound heterozygous mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal crypts have great capacity for repair and regeneration after intestinal stem cell (ISC) injury. Here, we define the cellular remodeling process resulting from ISC niche interruption by transient Notch pathway inhibition in adult mice. Although ISCs were retained, lineage tracing demonstrated a marked reduction in ISC function after Notch disruption. Surprisingly, Notch ligand-expressing Paneth cells were rapidly lost by apoptotic cell death. The ISC-Paneth cell changes were followed by a regenerative response, characterized by expansion of cells expressing Notch ligands Dll1 and Dll4, enhanced Notch signaling, and a proliferative surge. Lineage tracing and organoid studies showed that Dll1-expressing cells were activated to function as multipotential progenitors, generating both absorptive and secretory cells and replenishing the vacant Paneth cell pool. Our analysis uncovered a dynamic, multicellular remodeling response to acute Notch inhibition to repair the niche and restore homeostasis. Notably, this crypt regenerative response did not require ISC loss.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridium perfringens β-toxin (CPB) is a highly active β-pore-forming toxin (β-PFT) and the essential virulence factor for fatal, necro-hemorrhagic enteritis in animals and humans. The molecular mechanisms involved in CPB’s action on its target, the endothelium of small intestinal vessels, are poorly understood. Here, we identify platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31 or PECAM-1) as the specific membrane receptor for CPB on endothelial cells. CD31 expression corresponds with the cell-type specificity of CPB, and it is essential for toxicity in cultured cells and mice. Ectopic CD31 expression renders resistant cells and liposomes susceptible to CPB-induced membrane damage. Moreover, the extracellular Ig6 domain of mouse, human, and porcine CD31 is essential for the interaction with CPB. Hence, our results explain the cell-type specificity of CPB in vitro and in the natural disease caused by C. perfringens type C.

Abstract: Summary
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is critical for neurogenesis, but overexpression is also observed in multiple cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the function of DCLK1 in cancer, especially the context-dependent functions, are poorly understood. We present a “toolkit” that includes the DCLK1 inhibitor DCLK1-IN-1, a complementary DCLK1-IN-1-resistant mutation G532A, and kinase dead mutants D511N and D533N, which can be used to investigate signaling pathways regulated by DCLK1. Using a cancer cell line engineered to be DCLK1 dependent for growth and cell migration, we show that this toolkit can be used to discover associations between DCLK1 kinase activity and biological processes. In particular, we show an association between DCLK1 and RNA processing, including the identification of CDK11 as a potential substrate of DCLK1 using phosphoproteomics.

We investigated whether regional and cell maturation differences influence ALS astrocyte malfunction. Spinal and cortical astrocytes from SOD1G93A (mSOD1) 7-day-old mice were cultured for 5 and 13 days in vitro (DIV). Astrocyte aberrancies predominated in 13DIV cells with region specificity. 13DIV cortical mSOD1 astrocytes showed early morphological changes and a predominant reactive and inflammatory phenotype, while repressed proteins and genes were found in spinal cells. Inflammatory-associated miRNAs, e.g. miR-155/miR-21/miR-146a, were downregulated in the first and upregulated in the later ones. Interestingly, depleted miR-155/miR-21/miR-146a in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs/exosomes) was a common pathological feature. Cortical mSOD1 astrocytes induced late apoptosis and kinesin-1 downregulation in mSOD1 NSC-34 MNs, whereas spinal cells upregulated dynein, while decreased nNOS and synaptic-related genes. Both regional-distinct mSOD1 astrocytes enhanced iNOS gene expression in mSOD1 MNs. We provide information on the potential contribution of astrocytes to ALS bulbar-vs. spinal-onset pathology, local influence on neuronal dysfunction and their shared miRNA-depleted exosome trafficking. These causal and common features may have potential therapeutic implications in ALS. Future studies should clarify if astrocyte-derived sEVs are active players in ALS-related neuroinflammation and glial activation.

Abstract: Summary
ATP is an important energy metabolite and allosteric signal in health and disease. ATP-interacting proteins, such as P2 receptors, control inflammation, cell death, migration, and wound healing. However, identification of allosteric ATP sites remains challenging, and our current inventory of ATP-controlled pathways is likely incomplete. Here, we develop and verify mipATP as a minimally invasive photoaffinity probe for ATP-interacting proteins. Its N6 functionalization allows target enrichment by UV crosslinking and conjugation to reporter tags by “click” chemistry. The additions are compact, allowing mipATP to completely retain the calcium signaling responses of native ATP in vitro and in vivo. mipATP specifically enriched for known nucleotide binders in A549 cell lysates and membrane fractions. In addition, it retrieved unannotated ATP interactors, such as the FAS receptor, CD44, and various SLC transporters. Thus, mipATP is a promising tool to identify allosteric ATP sites in the proteome.

Abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in later child and adulthood. The human umbilical cord and its contents are of fetal origin and represent the fetus genetically and physiologically. Since it is not possible to obtain tissues from the fetus and newborn to investigate the association between GDM and later T2DM, we reprogrammed the stem cells from the Wharton’s jelly of umbilical cords (hWJSCs) of GDM and non-GDM mothers into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated the iPSCs into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) to provide pancreatic tissues that represent the fetus of GDM and normal mothers. These tissues are an attractive model to study the effects of glucose on the fetus. Interestingly, GDM-iPSCs had a decreased potential towards differentiation into IPCs. IPCs differentiated from GDM-iPSCs also had lower total insulin content and a lower capacity for insulin secretion to glucose stimulation compared to their normal-iPSC counterparts. This abnormal pathogenesis in GDM-iPSCs pancreatic differentiation recapitulates the pathology that may be observed in the infants of the diabetic mother (IDM) and while indicating adaptive mechanisms for fetal survival, may lead to the development of T2DM later in life.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) bear specific dysregulations in genes and pathways at distinct stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) that may help with classifying MS and non-MS subjects, specifying the early stage of disease, or discriminating among MS courses. Here we describe an unbiased machine learning workflow to build MS stage-specific classifiers based on PBMC transcriptomics profiles from more than 300 individuals, including healthy subjects and patients with clinically isolated syndromes, relapsing-remitting MS, primary or secondary progressive MS, or other neurological disorders. The pipeline, designed to optimize and compare the performance of distinct machine learning algorithms in the training cohort, generates predictive models not influenced by demographic features, such as age and gender, and displays high accuracy in the independent validation cohort. Proper application of machine learning to transcriptional profiles of circulating blood cells may allow identification of disease state and stage in MS.

Abstract: Recent advances of stem cell-based therapies in clinical trials have raised the need for large-scale manufacturing platforms that can supply clinically relevant doses to meet an increasing demand. Promising results have been reported using stirred-tank bioreactors, where human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs) were cultured in suspension on microcarriers (MCs), although the formation of microcarrier-cell-aggregates might still limit mass transfer and determine a heterogeneous distribution of hMSCs. A variety of MCs, bioreactor-impeller configurations, and agitation conditions have been established in an attempt to overcome the trade-off of ensuring good suspension while keeping the stresses to a minimum. While understanding and controlling the fluid flow environment of bioreactors has been initially under-appreciated, it has recently gained in popularity in the mission of providing ideal culture environments across different scales. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how rigorous engineering characterisation studies improved the outcome of biological process development and scale-up efforts. Reconciling these two disciplines is crucial to propose tailored bioprocessing solutions that can provide improved growth environments across a range of scales for the allogeneic cell therapies of the future.

Abstract: Background
Ischemia is the partial or complete blockage of blood supply to tissues. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a therapeutic tool for ischemic diseases. Most EV-based ischemia therapies are based on various stem cells. Here, we propose an alternative cell source for the isolation of pro-angiogenic EVs.
Methods
EVs were isolated from a mouse macrophage cell line (Raw 264.7). The characteristic features of the macrophage-derived EVs (MAC-EVs) were assessed using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blotting (WB) analysis. WB and qRT-PCR were performed to identify the pro-angiogenic VEGF and Wnt3a proteins and microRNAs (miR-210, miR-126, and miR-130a) in the MAC-EVs. In vitro and in vivo Matrigel plug assays were performed to investigate the capacity of the MAC-EVs for tube (blood vessel-like) formation and new blood vessel formation and assessed by histology.
Results
The MAC-EVs was positive for ALIX and negative for calnexin, with a round shape and an average size of 189 ± 65.1 nm. WB and qRT-PCR results revealed that VEGF, Wnt3a and miR-130a were more abundant in the MAC-EVs than cells. MAC-EVs treatment resulted in increased endothelial cellular proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. In vivo assay results revealed that MAC-EVs increased the formation of new and larger blood vessels in the Matrigel plug of mice compared to the formation in the control group.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that MAC-EVs have the potential to induce angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, could serve as a pro-angiogenic alternative for ischemic diseases.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins function as chaperones by binding unfolding substrate proteins in an ATP-independent manner to keep them in a folding-competent state and to prevent irreversible aggregation. They play crucial roles in diseases that are characterized by protein aggregation, such as neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, but are also involved in cataract, cancer, and congenital disorders. For this reason, these proteins are interesting therapeutic targets for finding molecules that could affect the chaperone activity or compensate specific mutations. This review will give an overview of the available knowledge on the structural complexity of human small heat shock proteins, which may aid in the search for such therapeutic molecules.

Abstract: Altered expression of microRNA (miRNA) is associated with the occurrence and metastasis of various tumors. We previously found that miR-218 inhibits tumor angiogenesis through the RICTOR/VEGFA axis in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we determined that miR-218 also had a negative effect on cell growth, migration, and invasion ability in PCa. Our data showed that miR-218 bound to the Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) 3'-UTR region and inhibited GAB2 expression. As a novel downstream target of miR-218, GAB2 has been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of various human tumors, but its role in the progression and metastasis of PCa has not been addressed. We demonstrated for the first time that the expression of GAB2 in the PCa cell lines was increased, while knocking down GAB2 significantly inhibited cell growth, metastatic ability and EMT process in PCa. In addition, the recovery of GAB2 could reverse the changes in the biological function of PCa cells caused by the ectopic expression of miR-218. Mechanistically, miR-218-mediated GAB2 transcriptional suppression significantly inhibited the activity of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway, whose abnormal activation was found to be related to the malignant progression of PCa. Taken together, our findings suggest that the miR-218/GAB2 axis may become a novel prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target in PCa.

Abstract: Sprifermin is a human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 18 (rhFGF18) in clinical development for knee osteoarthritis. Previously, we demonstrated that sprifermin exerts an anabolic effect on chondrocytes in 3D culture with cyclic but not permanent exposure. Here, we hypothesized that permanent exposure to sprifermin de-sensitizes the cells. To test this, a combination of Western-blot and cell staining methods was used. We demonstrate that sprifermin is transiently internalized in chondrocytes along with a transient increase in ERK1/2 activation. We also show that sprifermin is intracellularly degraded, probably together with its receptor FGFR3, thus preventing further stimulation. However, incubation without sprifermin re-sensitizes the cells. Finally, we show that sprifermin endocytosis is clathrin- and dynamin-independent and that receptor activation is not necessary for sprifermin's endocytosis. In this study, we link the role of endocytosis to the cell response and elucidate for the first time a de-sensitization phenomenon to a FGF.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a cancer-associated pathogen for which there is no vaccine. Successful anti-viral vaccines elicit antibodies that neutralize infectivity; however, it is unknown whether neutralizing antibodies prevent EBV acquisition. Here we assessed whether passively delivered AMMO1, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes EBV in a cell-type-independent manner, could protect against experimental EBV challenge in two animal infection models. When present prior to a high-dose intravenous EBV challenge, AMMO1 prevented viremia and reduced viral loads to nearly undetectable levels in humanized mice. AMMO1 conferred sterilizing immunity to three of four macaques challenged orally with rhesus lymphocryptovirus, the EBV ortholog that infects rhesus macaques. The infected macaque had lower plasma neutralizing activity than the protected animals. These results indicate that a vaccine capable of eliciting adequate titers of neutralizing antibodies targeting the AMMO1 epitope may protect against EBV acquisition and are therefore highly relevant to the design of an effective EBV vaccine.

Abstract: Recently, increasing evidences indicated that Platycodin D (PD) served as an effective anti-tumor drug for cancer treatment in clinic. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, we proved that PD regulated LncRNA-XIST/miR-335 axis to hamper the development of bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PD inhibited malignant phenotypes, including cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promoted cell apoptosis in bladder cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, the following experiments validated that PD inhibited LncRNA-XIST expressions, while increased miR-335 expression levels in bladder cancer cells. Next, by conducting the dual-luciferase reporter gene system assay and RNA pull-down assay, we validated that LncRNA-XIST inhibited miR-335 expressions through acting as RNA sponges, and the promoting effects of PD stimulation on miR-335 levels were abrogated by upregulating LncRNA-XIST. Interestingly, both silencing LncRNA-XIST and miR-335 overexpression enhanced the inhibiting effects of PD on the malignant phenotypes in bladder cancer cells. Consistently, the xenograft tumor-bearing mice models were established, and the data indicated that PD slowed down tumor growth and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, which were also aggravated by downregulating LncRNA-XIST. In general, analysis of data proved that targeting LncRNA-XIST/miR-335 axis was novel to enhance the anti-tumor effects of PD in bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo, and this study provided alternative therapeutic strategies for bladder cancer treatment in clinic.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant tumor in Southern China and Southeast Asia. In this study, we found that Leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was highly expressed in NPC tissues and marked NPC stem cells. Lgr5high tumors showed differential transcriptional landscape compared to Lgr5not high tumors. Lgr5 expression was associated with the clinicopathologic features in NPC and was able to regulate the stemness and viability of NPC cell line CNE1 and HNE1. Meanwhile, the migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was modulated by Lgr5 via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, Lgr5 could regulate the sensitivity of NPC cells to chemotherapy drugs. Xenografted tumors from Lgr5-overexpressed CNE1 cells showed stronger tumor forming capacity and higher expression level of stem cell markers. Thus, we characterized previously unidentified role of Lgr5 in NPC cells, potential serving as a NPC stem cell biomarker and a therapeutic target against NPC.

Abstract: As a kind of high-incidence malignant tumors in the digestive tract, colorectal cancer (CRC) has extremely morbidity and mortality in the population. LncRNAs have been proved to regulate the proliferation, chemoresistance and metastasis of tumors including CRC. LINC00689 and miR-31-5p in CRC were found misregulated in CRC by TCGA analysis. However, the mechanism of LINC00689 and miR-31-5p in regulating CRC remains unknown. The expression levels of LINC00689, miR-31-5p and LATS2 in CRC tissues and cell lines were examined by qRT-PCR assay. Cell proliferation, metastasis (including invasion and migration) were quantified by MTT assay, colony formation and Transwell assay, respectively. Western blotting assay was then performed to verify the levels of YAP/β-catenin and metastasis-related proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to evaluate the interaction between LINC00689 (LATS2) and miR-31-5p. Moreover, the function of LINC00689 and miR-31-5p were confirmed by CRC xenograft in nude mice. LINC00689 was decreased while miR-31-5p was increased in CRC. The overexpression of LINC00689 or the knockdown of miR-31-5p inhibited cell proliferation, chemoresistance and metastasis of CRC cells. Meanwhile, the up-regulated LATS2 suppressed the activity of YAP/β-catenin pathway to repress CRC occurrence. Silencing LATS2 reversed the inhibition effects of overexpression of LINC00689 or knockdown of miR-31-5p on proliferation, chemoresistance and metastasis of CRC cells. LINC00689 indeed acted as a miR-31-5p sponge to inhibit CRC proliferation, chemoresistance and metastasis through up-regulating LATS2 and repressing YAP/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
MKK7 (MEK7) is a key regulator of the JNK stress signaling pathway and targeting MKK7 has been proposed as a chemotherapeutic strategy. Detailed understanding of the MKK7 structure and factors that affect its activity is therefore of critical importance. Here, we present a comprehensive set of MKK7 crystal structures revealing insights into catalytic domain plasticity and the role of the N-terminal regulatory helix, conserved in all MAP2Ks, mediating kinase activation. Crystal structures harboring this regulatory helix revealed typical structural features of active kinase, providing exclusively a first model of the MAP2K active state. A small-molecule screening campaign yielded multiple scaffolds, including type II irreversible inhibitors a binding mode that has not been reported previously. We also observed an unprecedented allosteric pocket located in the N-terminal lobe for the approved drug ibrutinib. Collectively, our structural and functional data expand and provide alternative targeting strategies for this important MAP2K kinase.

Abstract: Summary
Satellite cells are main muscle stem cells that could provide myonuclei for myofiber growth and synaptic-specific gene expression during the early postnatal development. Here, we observed that splicing factor SRSF1 is highly expressed in myoblasts and its expression is closely related with satellite cell activation and proliferation. By genetic deletion of SRSF1 in myogenic progenitors, we found that SRSF1 is critical for satellite cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Most notably we also observed that SRSF1 is required for the functional neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, as SRSF1-deficient mice fail to form mature pretzel-like NMJs, which leads to muscle weakness and premature death in mice. Finally, we demonstrated that SRSF1 contributes to muscle innervation and muscle development likely by regulating a restricted set of tissue-specific alternative splicing events. Thus, our data define a unique role for SRSF1 in postnatal skeletal muscle growth and function in mice.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation is an important pathological feature and an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by activation of microglia and astrocytes. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is an endocytic receptor that is abundantly expressed in neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, and plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. There is increasing evidence to show that LRP1 regulates inflammatory responses by modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and phagocytosis. However, the effects of LRP1 on β-amyloid protein (Aβ)-induced microglial and astrocytic neuroinflammatory responses and its underlying mechanisms have not been studied in detail. In the present study, knockdown of LRP1 significantly enhanced Aβ1–42-stimulated neuroinflammation by increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both BV2 microglial cells and mouse primary astrocytes. Furthermore, it is revealed that LRP1 knockdown further led to the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. The phosphorylation of IκBα, p38, and JNK was significantly up-regulated in LRP1 knockdown BV2 microglial cells and primary astrocytes. Meanwhile, LRP1 knockdown increased expression of the NF-κB p65 subunit in the nucleus while decreased its expression in the cytoplasm. Besides, the upstream signaling adaptor molecules such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were also further increased. Moreover, blockade of NF-κB, p38, and JNK inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by the knockdown of LRP1. Taken together, these findings indicated that LRP1 as an effective therapeutic target against AD and other neuroinflammation related diseases.

Abstract: Cellular uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is mediated by a cell surface receptor (TCblR/CD320) that binds transcobalamin (TC) saturated with Cbl. TC is secreted by the vascular endothelium, has a relatively short half-life, binds Cbl with high affinity and presents the vitamin to the receptor for cellular uptake. Here we show binding and internalization of the TC-Cbl complex along with its’ receptor (TCblR) in several human cell lines. The expression of TCblR is linked to the cell cycle with highest expression in actively proliferating cells. Upon binding TC-Cbl, the receptors appear to segregate on the plasma membrane and are internalized over the course of 30–60 min. Subsequently, the receptors appear to be destroyed along with the TC, which results in the release of free Cbl in the lysosome. The appearance of TCblR on the cell surface is limited to newly synthesized protein without contribution from recycling of the receptor. Therefore, Cbl uptake into cells is fully dependent on the expression of newly synthesized TCblR that is up-regulated in actively proliferating cells. The cell cycle-associated up-regulation of TCblR in cancers provides a route for targeted drug delivery.

Abstract: Background
SARS-CoV2, the agent responsible for the current pandemic, is also causing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), hyperinflammation and high mortality. It is critical to dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms in order to reach a targeted therapeutic approach.
Methods
In the present investigation, we evaluated the effects of SARS-CoV2 on human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). We used RNA-seq datasets available online for identifying SARS-CoV2 potential genes target on human bronchial epithelial cells. RNA expression levels and potential cellular gene pathways have been analyzed. In order to identify possible common strategies among the main pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, we carried out a hypergeometric test of the main genes transcribed in the cells of the respiratory tract exposed to these viruses.
Results
The analysis showed that two mechanisms are highly regulated in HBEC: the innate immunity recruitment and the disassembly of cilia and cytoskeletal structure. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3) and dynein heavy chain 7, axonemal (DNAH7) represented respectively the most upregulated and downregulated genes belonging to the two mechanisms highlighted above. Furthermore, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7) that codifies for a surface protein is highly specific of SARS-CoV2 and not for SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and H1N1, suggesting a potential role in viral entry. In order to identify potential new drugs, using a machine learning approach, we highlighted Flunisolide, Thalidomide, Lenalidomide, Desoximetasone, xylazine, and salmeterol as potential drugs against SARS-CoV2 infection.
Conclusions
Overall, lung involvement and RDS could be generated by the activation and down regulation of diverse gene pathway involving respiratory cilia and muscle contraction, apoptotic phenomena, matrix destructuration, collagen deposition, neutrophil and macrophages recruitment.

Abstract: Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial inner membrane anion carrier and is emerging as a negative regulator of ROS production. Overexpression of UCP2 has been detected in various tumors, but its role in glioblastoma remains unclear. Using tissue microarrays and interrogations of public databases, we explored that the expression of UCP2 is upregulated in glioma, especially in GBM, and overexpression of UCP2 correlates with poor prognosis in glioma patients. To further reveal the role of UCP2 in glioma, UCP2-slienced cell lines (U251, U87MG and A172) by lentivirus were constructed to study how silenced UCP2 expression affects cellular functions in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. RNA-Seq based genome and pathway analysis were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action of UCP2. Our results revealed that UCP2 silenced glioma cells show inhibited migration, invasiveness, clonogenicity, proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis in vitro, and weaker tumorigenicity in nude mice. Transcriptome analysis suggested a UCP2-dependent regulation of p38 MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling networks, which was further validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Our research provides a new insight into the biological significance of UCP2 in glioma and its potential application in treatment and diagnosis.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is causing a devastating worldwide pandemic, and there is a pressing need to understand the development, specificity, and neutralizing potency of humoral immune responses during acute infection. We report a cross-sectional study of antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and virus neutralization activity in a cohort of 44 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RBD-specific IgG responses are detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. Isotype switching to IgG occurs rapidly, primarily to IgG1 and IgG3. Using a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate, neutralizing antibody titers are detectable in all patients by 6 days after PCR confirmation and correlate with RBD-specific binding IgG titers. The RBD-specific binding data were further validated in a clinical setting with 231 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. These findings have implications for understanding protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, therapeutic use of immune plasma, and development of much-needed vaccines.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Unfortunately, chemo-resistance is a huge obstacle in the treatment of OS. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of OS chemo-resistance still remain unknown. Here we reported that the resistance to camptothecin (cpt) therapy was driven by degradation of DDX5. DDX5 knockdown decreased cell death and DNA damage and recovered cell proliferation in cpt treated 143B cells. Furthermore, we found that DDX5 bound to NONO, a kind of DNA repairing protein, and regulated NONO functions. Our data verified that cpt-induced degradation of DDX5 following by breaking down the protein bound of NONO, which participated in the resistance of cpt. In the summary, according to our results, DDX5 might be a potential therapeutic target for improving clinical outcomes of cpt in OS.

Abstract: In vivo, small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are key players in maintaining a healthy proteome. αB-crystallin (αB-c) or HspB5 is one of the most widespread and populous of the ten human sHsps. Intracellularly, αB-c acts via its molecular chaperone action as the first line of defence in preventing target protein unfolding and aggregation under conditions of cellular stress. In this review, we explore how the structure of αB-c confers its function and interactions within its oligomeric self, with other sHsps, and with aggregation-prone target proteins. Firstly, the interaction between the two highly conserved regions of αB-c, the central α-crystallin domain and the C-terminal IXI motif and how this regulates αB-c chaperone activity are explored. Secondly, subunit exchange is rationalised as an integral structural and functional feature of αB-c. Thirdly, it is argued that monomeric αB-c may be its most chaperone-species active, but at the cost of increased hydrophobicity and instability. Fourthly, the reasons why hetero-oligomerisation of αB-c with other sHsps is important in regulating cellular proteostasis are examined. Finally, the interaction of αB-c with aggregation-prone, partially folded target proteins is discussed. Overall, this paper highlights the remarkably diverse capabilities of αB-c as a caretaker of the cell.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal regeneration is crucial for functional restoration after injury, and nutritional molecules can play an important role in this process. Here, we found that arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a direct proliferation promoter of intestinal epithelial cells that facilitates small intestinal regeneration in both three-dimensional cultured organoids and mouse models. As shown in the study, during post-irradiation regeneration, AA positively regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by upregulating the expression of Ascl2 and activating WNT signaling, but negatively regulates intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. AA acts as a delicate regulator that efficiently facilitates epithelial tissue repair by activating radiation-resistant Msi1+ cells rather than Lgr5+ cells, which are extensively considered WNT-activated crypt base stem cells. Additionally, short-term AA treatment maintains optimal intestinal epithelial homeostasis under physiological conditions. As a result, AA treatment can be considered a potential therapy for irradiation injury repair and tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinase 4 (IRAK4) belongs to the IRAK family of serine/threonine kinases and plays a central role in the innate immune response. However, the function of IRAK4 in tumor growth and progression remains elusive. Here we sought to determine the enzymatic and scaffolding functions of IRAK4 in activated B-cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL). We chose a highly selective IRAK4 kinase inhibitor to probe the biological effects of kinase inhibition and developed a series of IRAK4 degraders to evaluate the effects of protein degradation in ABC DLBCL cells. Interestingly, the results demonstrated that neither IRAK4 kinase inhibition nor protein degradation led to cell death or growth inhibition, suggesting a redundant role for IRAK4 in ABC DLBCL cell survival. IRAK4 degraders characterized in this study provide useful tools for understanding IRAK4 protein scaffolding function, which was previously unachievable using pharmacological perturbation.

Abstract: Summary
Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer remains a major challenge for the success of chemotherapy. Natural products have been a rich source for the discovery of drugs against MDR cancers. Here, we applied high-throughput cytotoxicity screening of an in-house natural product library against MDR SGC7901/VCR cells and identified that the cyclodepsipeptide verucopeptin demonstrated notable antitumor potency. Cytological profiling combined with click chemistry-based proteomics revealed that ATP6V1G directly interacted with verucopeptin. ATP6V1G, a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) that has not been previously targeted, was essential for SGC7901/VCR cell growth. Verucopeptin exhibited strong inhibition of both v-ATPase activity and mTORC1 signaling, leading to substantial pharmacological efficacy against SGC7901/VCR cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Our results demonstrate that targeting v-ATPase via its V1G subunit constitutes a unique approach for modulating v-ATPase and mTORC1 signaling with great potential for the development of therapeutics against MDR cancers.

Abstract: The transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has been found to be used as an effective therapy of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, the underlying mechanisms of BMSCs in the progress of IDD are not fully explained. In this study, we found that exosomes derived from BMSCs (BMSCs-Exos) inhibited the apoptotic rate, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and fibrosis deposition in TNF-α-induced nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Importantly, the level of miR-532–5p was observed to be decreased in apoptotic NPCs, but abundant in BMSCs-Exos with TNF-α treatment. The results showed that BMSCs-Exos under TNF-α stimuli exerted better effects on NPCs than BMSCs-Exos, which might be mitigated by the inhibition of miR-532–5p in BMSCs-Exos. The gain-of-function results suggested that the direct overexpression of miR-532–5p in NPCs could inhibit TNF-α-induced increase of apoptotic process, activation of apoptotic proteins, imbalance of anabolism/catabolism levels, and accumulation of collagen I. In addition, RASSF5 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-532–5p. Knockdown of RASSF5 could decrease the apoptotic cells and reduce the activated apoptotic protein levels in TNF-α-induced NPCs. Overall, these data indicate that exosomes from BMSCs may suppress TNF-α-induced apoptosis, ECM degradation, and fibrosis deposition in NPCs through the delivery of miR-532–5p via targeting RASSF5. This work provides a promising therapeutic strategy for the progress of IDD.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal muscle-wasting disease caused by DYSTROPHIN deficiency. Cell therapy using muscle stem cells (MuSCs) is a potential cure. Here, we report a differentiation method to generate fetal MuSCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by monitoring MYF5 expression. Gene expression profiling indicated that MYF5-positive cells in the late stage of differentiation have fetal MuSC characteristics, while MYF5-positive cells in the early stage of differentiation have early myogenic progenitor characteristics. Moreover, late-stage MYF5-positive cells demonstrated good muscle regeneration potential and produced DYSTROPHIN in vivo after transplantation into DMD model mice, resulting in muscle function recovery. The engrafted cells also generated PAX7-positive MuSC-like cells under the basal lamina of DYSTROPHIN-positive fibers. These findings suggest that MYF5-positive fetal MuSCs induced in the late stage of iPSC differentiation have cell therapy potential for DMD.

Abstract: Growing evidences suggest that the overexpression of p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) plays an important role in various tumor progression. However, the role of PAK5 and its downstream target gene(s) in lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) are waiting to be elucidated. TCGA data were utilized to evaluate the expression levels of PAK5 in LUSC. We then explored the role of PAK5 in maintaining the stem-like phenotype of lung squamous cancer cells through RT-PCR, flow cytometry, oncosphere-forming assay. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to determine SOX2 as a novel effector of PAK5. Xenograft models in nude mice were established to explore the roles of PAK5 in lung cancer growth. In this study, we have shown that PAK5 is overexpressed in LUSC tissues. The absence of PAK5 abolishes self-renewal ability of LUSC cells by decreasing the expression and phosphorylation of SOX2 in vitro and in vivo. In xenograft models, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of PAK5 suppressed the tumor growth and metastasis of lung squamous cancer cells in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that the PAK5-mediated SOX2 phosphorylation promoted the cancer stem cell-like phenotype of LUSC cells. PAK5 inhibition may be a promising target in the treatment of SOX2 positive lung squamous cell cancer.

Abstract: Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have played a crucial role in biomedical research where they can be used to elucidate gene function through the generation of genetically modified mice. A critical requirement for the success of this technology is the ability of ESCs to contribute to viable chimaeras with germ-line transmission of the genetically modified allele. We have identified several ESC clones that cause embryonic death of chimaeras at mid to late gestation stages. These clones had a normal karyotype, were pathogen free and their in vitro differentiation potential was not compromised. Chimaeric embryos developed normally up to E13.5 but showed a significant decrease in embryo survival by E17.5 with frequent haemorrhaging. We investigated the relationship between the ESCs transcriptional and epigenomic state and their ability to contribute to viable chimaeras. RNA sequencing identified four genes (Gtl2, Rian, Mirg and Rtl1as) located in the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted locus that were expressed at lower levels in the compromised ESC clones and this was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Bisulphite sequencing analysis showed significant hypermethylation at the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted locus with no consistent differences in methylation patterns at other imprinted loci. Treatment of the compromised ESCs with 5-azacytidine reactivated stable expression of Gtl2 and rescued the lethal phenotype but only gave low level chimaeras.

Abstract: Autophagy is a basic catabolic response that eukaryotic cells use to degrade unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components in an orderly and regulated manner. It plays important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, energy homeostasis, response to environmental stimuli, and the development of cancer. In solid tumors, hypoxia induces an increased HIF-1a that activates autophagy. However, the exact mechanism by which induced HIF-1a stimulates autophagy in cancer cells remains elusive. In the present study, we confirmed that ANKRD37 is upregulated in colon cancer tissue. Moreover, the higher expression level of ANKRD37 is related to a poorer survival rate. Using RNA interference, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence, we discovered that in cancer cell line RKO, hypoxia-induced HIF-1a regulates autophagy activity by increasing ANKRD37 level. In addition, intranuclear ANKRD37 played an important role in the regulation of hypoxia-induced autophagy. The translocation of ANKRD37 into cell nuclear is required for promoting cell growth and HIF-1a induced autophagy. These findings provide new insights to understand the hypoxia regulation mechanisms and the role of autophagy in cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Ureteral stents are commonly used to prevent urinary obstruction but can become colonized by bacteria and encrusted, leading to clinical complications. Despite recent discovery and characterization of the healthy urinary microbiota, stent-associated bacteria and their impact on encrustation are largely underexplored. We profile the microbiota of patients with typical short-term stents, as well as over 30 atypical cases (all with paired mid-stream urine) from 241 patients. Indwelling time, age, and various patient comorbidities correlate with alterations to the stent microbiota composition, whereas antibiotic exposure, urinary tract infection (UTI), and stent placement method do not. The stent microbiota most likely originates from adhesion of resident urinary microbes but subsequently diverges to a distinct, reproducible population, thereby negating the urine as a biomarker for stent encrustation or microbiota. Urological practice should reconsider standalone prophylactic antibiotics in favor of tailored therapies based on patient comorbidities in efforts to minimize bacterial burden, encrustation, and complications of ureteral stents.

Abstract: Summary
RP2 mutations cause a severe form of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). The mechanism of RP2-associated retinal degeneration in humans is unclear, and animal models of RP2 XLRP do not recapitulate this severe phenotype. Here, we developed gene-edited isogenic RP2 knockout (RP2 KO) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and RP2 patient-derived iPSC to produce 3D retinal organoids as a human retinal disease model. Strikingly, the RP2 KO and RP2 patient-derived organoids showed a peak in rod photoreceptor cell death at day 150 (D150) with subsequent thinning of the organoid outer nuclear layer (ONL) by D180 of culture. Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene augmentation with human RP2 rescued the degeneration phenotype of the RP2 KO organoids, to prevent ONL thinning and restore rhodopsin expression. Notably, these data show that 3D retinal organoids can be used to model photoreceptor degeneration and test potential therapies to prevent photoreceptor cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Active neural stem cells (aNSCs) and quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) are two distinct subpopulations found in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, to date, no cell surface marker has been established to identify and profile qNSCs in the adult hippocampus. Here, we identified expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on the cell surface of NSCs, through which we identified a previously unrecognized subpopulation of NSCs in the adult mouse DG. Interestingly, most VCAM1-expressing NSCs were largely quiescent. By injecting virus into Ai14 reporter mice to conduct lineage tracing in the adult DG, we confirmed that VCAM1-expressing cells were multipotent and capable of generating neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, depletion of Vcam1 during the embryonic or adult stage impaired spatial learning and memory in mice, accompanied by a reduced number of radial glial-like cells and proliferating NSCs in the subgranular zone of Vcam1 knockout mice.

Abstract: Near the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel highly contagious coronavirus phylogenetically related to the SARS virus, entered the human population with lethal consequences. This special issue devoted to the resulting disease COVID-19 was not planned but instead the articles accumulated organically as researchers in the cell stress response field noticed similarities among the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections and the responses that they studied in contexts unrelated to viral infection. We preface the issue with an introductory article which begins with a brief review of the structure and biology of SARS-CoV-2. As we collected and compared the COVID-19 articles, several shared themes emerged. In the second part of the introduction, each article is summarized briefly and the common themes that link each into a spontaneously arising chain of ideas and hypotheses are emphasized. These themes include growing evidence of molecular mimicry among the viral proteins and the proteins of patients. The realization that much of the consequences of such immune mimicry may play out on the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells raised the specter of autoimmune-induced vascular endothelial damage in multiple organs. Proposals of new therapeutic approaches have coalesced around the theme of inducing protection of the vascular endothelium. New chemical treatments that are proposed include stannous chloride, inducers of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide such as sodium thiosulfate and inducers of the cytoprotective stress protein heme oxygenase. Oxygen delivered by ventilators is already in extensive use to provide life support for patients with severe COVID-19. Two articles propose to advance the use of oxygen to the level of a therapeutic treatment early in the detection of the virus in infected patients by delivering oxygen under elevated pressure in hyperbaric chambers. At elevated blood plasma concentrations, hyperbaric oxygen is capable of achieving results far beyond the capability of ventilators as it promotes the activation of transcription factors that control the establishment of inducible cellular defense systems.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle has a capacity for muscular regeneration mediated by satellite cells (SCs) and non-SCs. Although it is proposed that non-SCs are attractive therapeutic targets for dystrophies, the biological properties of these cells remain unclear. We have recently identified novel multipotent pericytes (PCs), capillary stem cells (CapSCs) derived from the microvasculature. In the present study, we determined if CapSCs contributed to myogenic regeneration using muscular dystrophy mouse model. CapSCs were isolated as EphA7+NG2+PCs from the subcutaneous adipose tissues of GFP-transgenic mice. Co-culture with C2C12 myoblast cells showed that CapSCs effectively enhanced myogenesis as compared to controls including EphA7− PCs and adipose stromal cells (ASCs). CapSCs transplanted in cardiotoxin-injured gastrocnemius muscles were well differentiated into both muscle fibers and microvessels, as compared to controls. At three weeks after cell-transplantation into the limbs of the mdx/utrn-/-mouse, CapSCs increased the number of GFP+myofibers along with dystrophin expression and the area size of myofibers, and also enhanced the muscular mass and its performance, assessed by treadmill test as compared to controls. In conclusion, CapSCs have potent myogenic regeneration capacity and improved the pathological condition in a muscular dystrophy mouse. Thus, CapSCs are an attractive cellular source in regenerative therapy for muscular dystrophy.

Abstract: Insufficient trophoblast invasion has been shown to contribute to the occurrence and progression of preeclampsia (PE). Recently, beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein (β-TrCP) was shown to function as a ubiquitination regulator in regulating the proliferation and invasion of various cell types. In this study, we employed an in vitro model of trophoblasts to investigate the role played by β-TrCP in the pathogenesis of PE. The levels of β-TrCP in newly delivered placentas from 15 pregnant women with PE and 15 healthy pregnant women were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assays. The effects of β-TrCP on cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in two trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo and TEV-1) were examined using wound healing assays, Transwell assays, and western blot assays, respectively. Rescue experiments were performed by treating β-TrCP knockdown or β-TrCP expressing trophoblasts with si-Snail transfection or a proteasome inhibitor (MG132). β-TrCP mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased in the PE placentas when compared to the normal control placentas. β-TrCP overexpression significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, while silencing of β-TrCP promoted cell migration and invasion of the two trophoblast cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination might inhibit the EMT process of trophoblasts by down-regulating Snail expression. Our results suggest that both β-TrCP mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated in the PE placentas. β-TrCP impeded the migration and invasion of trophoblasts by suppressing Snail expression. This implicates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of PE, and suggests β-TrCP as a potential target for treating PE.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need for rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in hospitals to limit nosocomial spread. We report an evaluation of point of care (POC) nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in 149 participants with parallel combined nasal and throat swabbing for POC versus standard lab RT-PCR testing. Median time to result is 2.6 (IQR 2.3–4.8) versus 26.4 h (IQR 21.4–31.4, p < 0.001), with 32 (21.5%) positive and 117 (78.5%) negative. Cohen’s κ correlation between tests is 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–1.00). When comparing nearly 1,000 tests pre- and post-implementation, the median time to definitive bed placement from admission is 23.4 (8.6-41.9) versus 17.1 h (9.0–28.8), p = 0.02. Mean length of stay on COVID-19 “holding” wards is 58.5 versus 29.9 h (p < 0.001). POC testing increases isolation room availability, avoids bed closures, allows discharge to care homes, and expedites access to hospital procedures. POC testing could mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on hospital systems.

Abstract: The poor prognosis of ovarian cancer is partly attributed to the frequent chemo-resistance and recurrence, which may be mediated by ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms contributing to the stemness of OCSCs, focusing on the long non-coding RNA HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR). Ovarian cancer cells were tested for high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity or high in vitro sphere-formation ability to identify OCSCs. HOTAIR was highly expressed in the OCSCs and its depletion caused a decrease in sphere-formation ability, along with reduced resistance to cisplatin and in vivo tumorigenicity. T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) was highly expressed in the OCSCs and was confirmed to be positively regulated by HOTAIR. Moreover, TBX3 maintained cell stemness, whereas elevating TBX3 could relieve the weakened sphere-formation ability caused by HOTAIR depletion. Subsequently, miR-206 was found to mediate the expression regulation of TBX3 by HOTAIR, and functionally involved in the regulation of stemness in OCSCs. In line with these findings, circulating HOTAIR expression was up-regulated in ovarian cancer patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that HOTAIR relieves the inhibition of TBX3 expression mediated by miR-206 in OCSCs and provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: The NUDT family is thought to play an important role in cancer growth and progression. However, the clinicopathologic significance and potential role of nucleotide diphosphate-linked X-component motif 21, NM_007006 (NUDT21) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that NUDT21 was frequently up-expressed in PDAC. Clinical data revealed that its level positively correlated with poor survival of patients with PDAC. We found that knockdown of NUDT21 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Screening by microarray analysis and verifying by Western blot, we found that the EIF2 signaling pathway represented the main molecular mechanism underlying the effects of NUDT21 knockdown in PANC-1 cells, and PKR, HSPA5, EIF4E and DDIT3 may be its target genes. Thus, our results revealed for the first time that NUDT21, a valuable marker of PDAC prognosis, promotes tumor proliferation, inhibits cells apoptosis and might represent a potential target for gene-based therapy.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle preservation is a dynamic process that involves constant repair and regeneration. However, the regenerative capacity of muscle cells declines in hyperglycemia. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this glucotoxicity during myoblast differentiation. C2C12 cells were exposed to different concentrations of glucose, to recapitulate the development of skeletal muscles in vivo in normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. In high glucose conditions, we found significant increases in levels of total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a reorganization of SUMO enzyme transcripts and SUMOylated proteins. Furthermore, in anticipation of the ROS-induced damage to newly formed myotubes, we observed acceleration of myogenesis. Interestingly, we found a tight relationship between SUMOylation of the Histone methyltransferase SET7/9 and the maintenance of sarcomeric structures of newly formed myotubes. Finally, treatment with the antioxidant anacardic acid preserved the function and activity of myotubes generated in high-glucose conditions by interfering with both ROS and SUMO pathways. Combined, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress and modulation of SUMO reactions are key mediators of glucotoxicity and inhibition of these perturbations using antioxidants might improve muscle regeneration in hyperglycemia.

The data are discussed in the context of the concept of cellular caloristasis networks. The information on the changes in cellular energy metabolism stimulated by HBOT presented here provides new insights into the cellular energy state and mitochondrial environment in which sHSPs function. These data will be useful in forming testable hypotheses about the functions of translocated sHSPs in human mitochondria responding to stressors.

Abstract: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an organ failure syndrome caused by overactivation of the immune system. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to be effective in ARDS therapy due to their excellent immunomodulatory abilities; however, people are concerned about the safety of infusing exogenous cells. We found that rat lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells (LRMSCs) (Sca-1+CD45−CD31−) played important roles in regulating inflammation in the lungs during the pathogenesis of ARDS. LRMSCs could regulate the production of cytokines (TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-10) by both innate and adaptive immune cells following LPS stimulation in vivo or in vitro. We also found that Herpes Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM) expression in LRMSCs enhanced the immunomodulatory ability of LRMSCs, and expression of the HVEM ligand B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) in innate and adaptive immune cells was required. The clarification of this immunoregulatory mechanism may provide evidence for ARDS therapy mediated by mobilizing endogenous MSCs in the future.

Abstract: The constitutive photomorphogenic 9 (COP9) signalosome complex subunit 6 (COPS6/CSN6) is crucial for structural integrity of the COP9 signalosome complex. CSN6 participates in various aspects of cancer progression, but its role in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not clear. Here, we found that the expression of CSN6 was increased in Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophic mice hearts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Inhibition of CSN6 decreased the cardiomyocyte size and fetal genes’ expression in Ang II-induced hypertrophic NRCMs, while overexpression of CSN6 aggravated Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy. Moreover, we demonstrated that the pro-hypertrophic function of CSN6 was mediated by SIRT2, which acts as a cardioprotective factor in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. CSN6 inhibited the expression of SIRT2, and re-expression of SIRT2 attenuated the myocardial hypertrophy caused by CSN6 overexpression. Further investigation discovered that CSN6 suppressed the expression of SIRT2 via up-regulating Nkx2.2, a transcription suppressor of SIRT2. Mechanistically, CSN6 blocked the ubiquitin proteasome system-mediated degradation of Nkx2.2 protein by interacting with it and inhibiting its ubiquitination directly in cardiomyocytes. Finally, our data showed that CSN6 was partially dependent on the stabilization of Nkx2.2 protein to inhibit SIRT2 and promote myocardial hypertrophy. Overall, our study identified CSN6 as a pro-hypertrophic deubiquitinase, and CSN6 inhibition may be a potential treatment strategy for heart failure.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) has been recognized as one of the essential regulators that is expressed in greater levels in pancreatic cancer (PC) and is connected with poor prognosis. Resveratrol was identified as a natural compound with many biological functions, with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects that inhibit the proliferation and progression of PC cells caused by HIF-1α. The current investigation explored the binding affinity and ligand efficacy of resveratrol against HIF-1α using an in silico approach, and the execution of molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) increased the prediction precision of these outcomes. This is the first study that provides an in silico characterization of the interaction between resveratrol and HIF-1α and its spatial structural arrangements in pancreatic cancer therapy, providing an in-depth analysis of their drug target interactions.

Abstract: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is major hereditary neuropathy. CMT has been linked to mutations in a range of proteins, including the small heat shock protein HspB1. Here we review the properties of several HspB1 mutants associated with CMT. In vitro, mutations in the N-terminal domain lead to a formation of larger HspB1 oligomers when compared with the wild-type (WT) protein. These mutants are resistant to phosphorylation-induced dissociation and reveal lower chaperone-like activity than the WT on a range of model substrates. Mutations in the α-crystallin domain lead to the formation of yet larger HspB1 oligomers tending to dissociate at low protein concentration and having variable chaperone-like activity. Mutations in the conservative IPV motif within the C-terminal domain induce the formation of very large oligomers with low chaperone-like activity. Most mutants interact with a partner small heat shock protein, HspB6, in a manner different from that of the WT protein. The link between the altered physico-chemical properties and the pathological CMT phenotype is a subject of discussion. Certain HspB1 mutations appear to have an effect on cytoskeletal elements such as intermediate filaments and/or microtubules, and by this means damage the axonal transport. In addition, mutations of HspB1 can affect the metabolism in astroglia and indirectly modulate the viability of motor neurons. While the mechanisms of pathological mutations in HspB1 are likely to vary greatly across different mutations, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required for a better understanding of the CMT disease at molecular level.

Abstract: A great deal of evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function in the tumorigenesis of retinoblastoma (RB). However, the roles of lncRNA ILF3-AS1 in RB are still unclear. In the present study, our work revealed that the lncRNA ILF3-AS1 was increased in both RB tissues and cell lines. Repression of ILF3-AS1 suppressed both RB cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. ILF3-AS1 also promoted tumor growth in vivo. While exploring the mechanisms behind ILF3-AS1 in RB, we identified that ILF3-AS1 sponges with miR-132–3p that is expressed at low levels in RB tissues as well as attenuates RB progression. Furthermore, SMAD2 was confirmed to be a miR-132–3p target. Finally, we found that SMAD2 overexpression or miR-132–3p inhibitors recover the inhibitory effects of ILF3-AS1 suppression on RB progression. Collectively, these data indicate that ILF3-AS1 is involved in RB progression through the miR-132–3p/SMAD2 axis, providing a novel and promising biomarker that can be used for the treatment of RB.

Abstract: Summary
The gut-brain axis is crucial to microbial-host interactions. The neurotransmitter serotonin is primarily synthesized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it is secreted into the lumen and subsequently removed by the serotonin transporter, SERT. Here, we show that serotonin decreases virulence gene expression by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model for EHEC. The membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase, CpxA, is a bacterial serotonin receptor. Serotonin induces dephosphorylation of CpxA, which inactivates the transcriptional factor CpxR controlling expression of virulence genes, notably those within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Increasing intestinal serotonin by genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting SERT decreases LEE expression and reduces C. rodentium loads. Conversely, inhibiting serotonin synthesis increases pathogenesis and decreases host survival. As other enteric bacteria contain CpxA, this signal exploitation may be engaged by other pathogens. Additionally, repurposing serotonin agonists to inhibit CpxA may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for enteric bacteria.

Abstract: Promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERTp) constitutes a regulatory element capable to affect TERT expression (TE), telomerase activity (TA) and telomere length (TL). TERTp mutation status, TL, TA and TE were assessed in 27 in vitro cultured human cell lines, including 11 solid tumour, 13 haematological and 3 normal cell lines. C228T and C250T TERTp mutations were detected in 5 solid tumour and none of haematological cell lines (p = 0.0100). As compared to other solid tumour cell lines, those with the presence of somatic mutations were characterized by: shorter TL, lower TA and TE. Furthermore, cell lines carrying TERTp mutations showed a linear correlation between TE and TA (R = 0.9708, p = 0.0021). Moreover, haematological cell lines exhibited higher TE compared to solid tumour cell lines (p = 0.0007). TL and TA were correlated in both solid tumour (R = 0.4875, p = 0.0169) and haematological (R = 0.4719, p = 0.0095) cell lines. Our results based on the in vitro model suggest that oncogenic processes may differ between solid tumours and haematological malignancies with regard to their TERT gene regulation mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
K-RAS is known as the most frequently mutated oncogene. However, the development of conventional K-RAS inhibitors has been extremely challenging, with a mutation-specific inhibitor reaching clinical trials only recently. Targeted proteolysis has emerged as a new modality in drug discovery to tackle undruggable targets. Our laboratory has developed a system for targeted proteolysis using peptidic high-affinity binders, called “AdPROM.” Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock in a GFP tag on the native K-RAS gene in A549 adenocarcinoma (A549GFPKRAS) cells and constructed AdPROMs containing high-affinity GFP or H/K-RAS binders. Expression of GFP-targeting AdPROM in A549GFPKRAS led to robust proteasomal degradation of endogenous GFP-K-RAS, while expression of anti-HRAS-targeting AdPROM in different cell lines resulted in the degradation of both GFP-tagged and untagged K-RAS, and untagged H-RAS. Our findings imply that endogenous RAS proteins can be targeted for proteolysis, supporting the idea of an alternative therapeutic approach to these undruggable targets.

Abstract: Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 6 (NLRP6) plays a key role in innate immunity, host defense and tumorigenesis. Our previous study has demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of NLRP6 in gastric cancer. In the present study, we explored the interaction protein of NLRP6 by Flag-tagged immunoprecipitation assay and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. The 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a heat shock protein, was identified as an interaction protein of NLRP6. The binding of NLRP6 to GRP78 was through the Pyrin domain, and the substrate binding domain (SBD) domain of GRP78 was responsible for the interaction with NLRP6. NLRP6 overexpression enhanced the polyubiquitination of GRP78 in gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of GRP78 abolished the effects of NLRP6 overexpression in gastric cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis, migration and Cyclin D1 expression. GRP78 knockdown reversed the effects of NLRP6 knockdown on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. NLRP6 expression was negatively correlated with GRP78 expression in human gastric tissues. Tumorigenicity assay indicated that GRP78 mediated the functions of NLRP6 on gastric cancer cell growth in vivo. ON-013100, which could inhibit Cyclin D1 expression, was less effective in treating xenografts of gastric cancer cells with higher level of NLRP6 than in those with lower level of NLRP6. In conclusion, our study suggested that NLRP6 exerted inhibitory effects on gastric cancer cell growth by promoting the ubiquitination of GRP78.

Abstract: Summary
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) are used for HIV treatment and prevention. Previously, we found that topical rectal tenofovir gel caused immunological changes in the mucosa. Here, we assess the effect of oral TDF/FTC in three HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trials, two with gastrointestinal and one with cervicovaginal biopsies. TDF/FTC induces type I/III interferon-related (IFN I/III) genes in the gastrointestinal tract, but not blood, with strong correlations between the two independent rectal biopsy groups (Spearman r = 0.91) and between the rectum and duodenum (r = 0.81). Gene set testing also indicates stimulation of the type I/III pathways in the ectocervix and of cellular proliferation in the duodenum. mRNA sequencing, digital droplet PCR, proteomics, and immunofluorescence confirm IFN I/III pathway stimulation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, oral TDF/FTC stimulates an IFN I/III signature throughout the gut, which could increase antiviral efficacy but also cause chronic immune activation in HIV prevention and treatment settings.

Abstract: Summary
The affinity-directed protein missile (AdPROM) system utilizes specific polypeptide binders of intracellular proteins of interest (POIs) conjugated to an E3 ubiquitin ligase moiety to enable targeted proteolysis of the POI. However, a chemically tuneable AdPROM system is more desirable. Here, we use Halo-tag/VHL-recruiting proteolysis-targeting chimera (HaloPROTAC) technology to develop a ligand-inducible AdPROM (L-AdPROM) system. When we express an L-AdPROM construct consisting of an anti-GFP nanobody conjugated to the Halo-tag, we achieve robust degradation of GFP-tagged POIs only upon treatment of cells with the HaloPROTAC. For GFP-tagged POIs, ULK1, FAM83D, and SGK3 were knocked in with a GFP-tag using CRISPR/Cas9. By substituting the anti-GFP nanobody for a monobody that binds H- and K-RAS, we achieve robust degradation of unmodified endogenous RAS proteins only in the presence of the HaloPROTAC. Through substitution of the polypeptide binder, the highly versatile L-AdPROM system is useful for the inducible degradation of potentially any intracellular POI.

Abstract: The relationship between Lamin B2 and tumor proliferation and migration is unclear. We explored the impact of Lamin B2 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were combined to evaluate Lamin B2 expression and its relationship with the clinicopathological factors found in NSCLC. Western blotting, immunofluorescence analysis, and bioinformatics were used to investigate the effects of Lamin B2 on various regulatory pathways in cancer. Cytological experiments were conducted to evaluate Lamin B2 expression in tumor cells. We conducted co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between Lamin B2 and NSCLC and evaluate the results of rescue experiments. Lamin B2 was highly expressed in NSCLC and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis. In NSCLC, Lamin B2 interacted with Cyclin D1, upregulating G9α expression, thus increasing H3K9me2 levels. H3K9me2 binds to the promoter region of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) to induce CDH1 silencing and promotes cancer cell migration. Thus, we found that Lamin B2 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells and promoted their migration by increasing H3K9me2 levels, which induced E-cadherin gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
We earlier showed that outside-in integrin signaling through POSTN-ITGAV interaction plays an important role in regulating adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence. Here, we show that Itgav deletion results in increased frequency of phenotypic HSCs in fetal liver (FL) due to faster proliferation. Systemic deletion of Postn led to increased proliferation of FL HSCs, albeit without any loss of stemness, unlike Vav-Itgav−/− HSCs. Based on RNA sequencing analysis of FL and bone marrow HSCs, we predicted the involvement of DNA damage response pathways in this dichotomy. Indeed, proliferative HSCs from Postn-deficient FL tissues showed increased levels of DNA repair, resulting in lesser double-strand breaks. Thus POSTN, with its expression majorly localized in the vascular endothelium of FL tissue, acts as a regulator of stem cell pool size during development. Overall, we demonstrate that the duality of response to proliferation in HSCs is developmental stage dependent and can be correlated with DNA damage responses.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with the genetic disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are at risk of developing lung and liver disease. Patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been found to model features of AATD pathogenesis but only a handful of AATD patient iPSC lines have been published. To capture the significant phenotypic diversity of the patient population, we describe here the establishment and characterization of a curated repository of AATD iPSCs with associated disease-relevant clinical data. To highlight the utility of the repository, we selected a subset of iPSC lines for functional characterization. Selected lines were differentiated to generate both hepatic and lung cell lineages and analyzed by RNA sequencing. In addition, two iPSC lines were targeted using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to accomplish scarless repair. Repository iPSCs are available to investigators for studies of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Asymptomatic and obligatory liver stage (LS) infection of Plasmodium parasites presents an attractive target for antimalarial vaccine and drug development. Lack of robust cellular models to study LS infection has hindered the discovery and validation of host genes essential for intrahepatic parasite development. Here, we present a chemically differentiated mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based LS model, which supports complete development of Plasmodium berghei exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) and can be used to define new host-parasite interactions. Using our model, we established that host Pnpla2, coding for adipose triglyceride lipase, is dispensable for P. berghei EEF development. In addition, we also evaluated in-vitro-differentiated human hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) to study LS of P. berghei and found it to be a sub-optimal infection model. Overall, our results present a new mouse ESC-based P. berghei LS infection model that can be utilized to study the impact of host genetic variation on parasite development.

Abstract: Summary
The Salmonella enterica effector SteD depletes mature MHC class II (mMHCII) molecules from the surface of infected antigen-presenting cells through ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the mMHCII β chain. Here, through a genome-wide mutant screen of human antigen-presenting cells, we show that the NEDD4 family HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 and a tumor-suppressing transmembrane protein of unknown biochemical function, TMEM127, are required for SteD-dependent ubiquitination of mMHCII. Although evidently not involved in normal regulation of mMHCII, TMEM127 was essential for SteD to suppress both mMHCII antigen presentation in mouse dendritic cells and MHCII-dependent CD4+ T cell activation. We found that TMEM127 contains a canonical PPxY motif, which was required for binding to WWP2. SteD bound to TMEM127 and enabled TMEM127 to interact with and induce ubiquitination of mature MHCII. Furthermore, SteD also underwent TMEM127- and WWP2-dependent ubiquitination, which both contributed to its degradation and augmented its activity on mMHCII.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin regulators play fundamental roles in controlling pluripotency and differentiation. We examined the effect of mutations in 703 genes from nearly 70 chromatin-modifying complexes on human embryonic stem cell (ESC) growth. While the vast majority of chromatin-associated complexes are essential for ESC growth, the only complexes that conferred growth advantage upon mutation of their members, were the repressive complexes LSD-CoREST and BHC. Both complexes include the most potent growth-restricting chromatin-related protein, ZMYM2. Interestingly, while ZMYM2 expression is rather low in human blastocysts, its expression peaks in primed ESCs and is again downregulated upon differentiation. ZMYM2-null ESCs overexpress pluripotency genes and show genome-wide promotor-localized histone H3 hyper-acetylation. These mutant cells were also refractory to differentiate in vitro and failed to produce teratomas upon injection into immunodeficient mice. Our results suggest a central role for ZMYM2 in the transcriptional regulation of the undifferentiated state and in the exit-from-pluripotency of human ESCs.

Abstract: Ovarian tumour domain containing 6B antisense RNA1 (OTUD6B-AS1), a newly identified long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), has been reported as a key cancer-related lncRNA. However, the detailed relevance of OTUD6B-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined. This study was designed to determine the functional significance and regulatory mechanism of OTUD6B-AS1 in HCC. We found that the expression of OTUD6B-AS1 was up-regulated in HCC tissues, and patients with high levels of OTUD6B-AS1 expression had shorter survival rates than those with low OTUD6B-AS1 expression. Elevated expression of the lncRNA was also found in multiple HCC cell lines and the silencing of OTUD6B-AS1 significantly decreased proliferation, colony formation and invasion. Correspondingly, OTUD6B-AS1 overexpression had the opposite effect on HCC cell invasion, colony formation and proliferation. Notably, OTUD6B-AS1 was identified as a molecular sponge of microRNA-664b-3p (miR-664b-3p). The down-regulation of miR-664b-3p was detected in HCC tissues and cell lines, and the up-regulation of miR-664b-3p repressed proliferation and invasion in HCC cells by targeting the glycogen synthase kinase-3β interaction protein (GSKIP). Moreover, OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown or miR-664b-3p up-regulation exerted a suppressive effect on Wnt/β-catenin signalling via the down-regulation of GSKIP. In addition, GSKIP overexpression markedly reversed OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown- or miR-664b-3p overexpression-induced antitumour effects in HCC. Further data confirmed that OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown exerted a tumour-inhibition role in HCC in vivo. Overall, these findings indicate that the lncRNA OTUD6B-AS1 accelerates the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells by enhancing GSKIP/Wnt/β-catenin signalling via the sequestration of miR-664b-3p. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism, mediated by lncRNA OTUD6B-AS1, which may play a key role in regulating the progression of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Medium-sized macrocyclic peptides are an alternative to small compounds and large biomolecules as a class of pharmaceutics. The CD47-SIRPα signaling axis functions as an innate immune checkpoint that inhibits phagocytosis in phagocytes and has been implicated as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. The potential of macrocyclic peptides that target this signaling axis as immunotherapeutic agents has remained unknown, however. Here we have developed a macrocyclic peptide consisting of 15 amino acids that binds to the ectodomain of mouse SIRPα and efficiently blocks its interaction with CD47 in an allosteric manner. The peptide markedly promoted the phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized tumor cells by macrophages in vitro as well as enhanced the inhibitory effect of anti-CD20 or anti-gp75 antibodies on tumor formation or metastasis in vivo. Our results suggest that allosteric inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction by macrocyclic peptides is a potential approach to cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Differentiation of mammalian pluripotent cells involves large-scale changes in transcription and, among the molecules that orchestrate these changes, chromatin remodellers are essential to initiate, establish and maintain a new gene regulatory network. The Nucleosome Remodelling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex is a highly conserved chromatin remodeller which fine-tunes gene expression in embryonic stem cells. While the function of NuRD in mouse pluripotent cells has been well defined, no study yet has defined NuRD function in human pluripotent cells. Here we find that while NuRD activity is required for lineage commitment from primed pluripotency in both human and mouse cells, the nature of this requirement is surprisingly different. While mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and epiblast stem cells (mEpiSC) require NuRD to maintain an appropriate differentiation trajectory as judged by gene expression profiling, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) lacking NuRD fail to even initiate these trajectories. Further, while NuRD activity is dispensable for self-renewal of mESCs and mEpiSCs, hiPSCs require NuRD to maintain a stable self-renewing state. These studies reveal that failure to properly fine-tune gene expression and/or to reduce transcriptional noise through the action of a highly conserved chromatin remodeller can have different consequences in human and mouse pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a special type of non-coding RNA molecules, have been addressed to be implicated in gastric cancer progression. The GSE93541 and GSE83521 microarrays found hsa-circRNA-000670 (hsa-circ-0000670) as an up-regulated circRNAin gastric cancer. We mainly investigated the function and molecular mechanisms of hsa-circ-0000670 involved in gastric cancer. The expression of hsa-circ-0000670 was determined by RT-qPCR to be highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues relative to corresponding adjacent normal tissues, as well as in gastric cancer cell lines relative to normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line. By conducting EdU, scratch test and Transwell assays, hsa-circ-000670 was found to be a tumor promoter by potentiating the proliferative, invasive and migrating capabilities of gastric cancer cells. Consistently, a tumor-promotive role of hsa-circ-000670 was validated in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and RIP assays identified the binding of hsa-circ-0000670 to microRNA-384 (miR-384) and the binding of miR-384 to sine oculis-related homeobox 4 (SIX4). The oncogenic potential of hsa-circ-0000670 in gastric cancer cells were inhibited by overexpressed miR-384. Mechanistically, SIX4 was targeted by miR-384 and was upregulated in gastric cancer. High SIX4 expression was suggested to correlate with the poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Additionally, silencing of SIX4 delayed tumor growth and progression, which were reversed by overexpression of hsa-circ-0000670. Taken together, hsa-circ-0000670 acts as a tumor promotor in gastric cancer progression and might be a potential target for gastric cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in infectious disease control strategies through genetic manipulation of insect microbiomes have heightened interest in microbially produced small molecules within mosquitoes. Herein, 33 mosquito-associated bacterial genomes were mined and over 700 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were identified, 135 of which belong to known classes of BGCs. After an in-depth analysis of the 135 BGCs, iron-binding siderophores were chosen for further investigation due to their high abundance and well-characterized bioactivities. Through various metabolomic strategies, eight siderophore scaffolds were identified in six strains of mosquito-associated bacteria. Among these, serratiochelin A and pyochelin were found to reduce female Anopheles gambiae overall fecundity likely by lowering their blood-feeding rate. Serratiochelin A and pyochelin were further found to inhibit the Plasmodium parasite asexual blood and liver stages in vitro. Our work supplies a bioinformatic resource for future mosquito-microbiome studies and highlights an understudied source of bioactive small molecules.

Abstract: Background & aims
Biliary injury is one of the main pathological mechanisms of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4)-mediated Notch activation contributes to reversing biliary injury; however, the specific role of DLL4 in biliary restoration is still unclear. This study aimed to determine whether human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) can differentiate into biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) in vitro and in vivo and to clarify the role of DLL4 in restoring damaged liver by enhancing cholangiocyte differentiation.

hBMSCs were transplanted into immunodeficient mice (FRGS) with FHF induced by the hamster-anti-mouse CD95 antibody JO2. The appearance of human cholangiocytes was evaluated in the generated hBMSC-FRGS mice by q-PCR expression, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The potency of DLL4 in inducing cholangiocyte differentiation from hBMSCs was assessed by observing the cell morphology and measuring the expression of cholangiocyte-specific genes and proteins.
Results
Human KRT19- and KRT7-double-positive cholangiocyte-like cells appeared in hBMSC-FRGS mice at 12 weeks after transplantation. After these cells were separated and collected by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), there were high levels of expression of eight typical human cholangiocyte-specific genes and proteins (e.g., KRT19 and KRT7). Furthermore, hBMSC-derived cholangiocytes induced by DLL4 had a better shape with higher nucleus/cytoplasm ratios and showed a specific increase in the expression of cholangiocyte-specific genes and proteins (e.g., KRT19, KRT7, SOX9 and CFTR).
Conclusions
Cholangiocytes can be efficiently differentiated from hBMSCs in vivo and in vitro. DLL4 restores damaged liver by enhancing cholangiocyte differentiation from hBMSCs and has the potential to be used in future clinical therapeutic applications.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miR) deregulation is frequently seen in colon cancer. In this study, we sought to investigate biological effects of miR-193a on colon cancer and its underlying mechanism. Microarray analysis was conducted to obtain the differentially expressed miRs and their target genes in colon cancer. Bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) were obtained. The functional roles of miR-193a and FAK in colon cancer were determined using loss- and gain-function experiments. The cell proliferation, and migration and invasion were evaluated by CCK-8 and Transwell assay respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-193a and FAK. Furthermore, in vivo experiment was conducted to test the roles of EV miR-193a in colon cancer growth, followed by determination of PCNA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 protein expression using Western blot analysis. MiR-193a was downregulated, whereas FAK was upregulated in colon cancer. MiR-193a upregulation or FAK downregulation inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. miR-193a could downregulate FAK. Upregulation of EV miR-193a was observed to impede proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by decreased PCNA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression. In summary, EV miR-193a derived from MSCs impeded colon cancer progression by targeting FAK, thus suggesting a new potential strategy for colon cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis, or the accumulation of extracellular matrix, is a common feature of many chronic diseases. To interrogate core molecular pathways underlying fibrosis, we cross-examine human primary cells from various tissues treated with TGF-β, as well as kidney and liver fibrosis models. Transcriptome analyses reveal that genes involved in fatty acid oxidation are significantly perturbed. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction and acylcarnitine accumulation are found in fibrotic tissues. Substantial downregulation of the PGC1α gene is evident in both in vitro and in vivo fibrosis models, suggesting a common node of metabolic signature for tissue fibrosis. In order to identify suppressors of fibrosis, we carry out a compound library phenotypic screen and identify AMPK and PPAR as highly enriched targets. We further show that pharmacological treatment of MK-8722 (AMPK activator) and MK-4074 (ACC inhibitor) reduce fibrosis in vivo. Altogether, our work demonstrate that metabolic defect is integral to TGF-β signaling and fibrosis.

Abstract: Intestinal organoids are self-organized 3-dimensional (3D) structures formed by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells. This innovative in vitro model is highly relevant to study physiology of the intestinal epithelium and its role in nutrition and barrier function. However, this model has never been developed in rabbits, while it would have potential applications for biomedical and veterinary research. Here, we cultured rabbit caecum organoids with either pharmacological inhibitors (2Ki medium) or L-WRN cells conditioned medium (L-WRN CM) to reconstitute the intestinal stem cell niche in vitro. Large spherical organoids were obtained with the 2Ki medium and this morphology was associated with a high level of proliferation and stem cells markers gene expression. In contrast, organoids cultured with L-WRN CM had a smaller diameter; a greater cell height and part of them were not spherical. When the L-WRN CM was used at low concentration (5%) for two days, the gene expression of stem cells and proliferation markers were very low, while absorptive and secretory cells markers and antimicrobial peptides were elevated. Epithelial cells within organoids were polarized in 3D cultures with 2Ki medium or L-WRN CM (apical side towards the lumen). We cultured dissociated organoid cells in 2D monolayers, which allowed accessibility to the apical compartment. Under these conditions, actin stress fibers were observed with the 2Ki medium, while perijonctionnal localization of actin was observed with the L-WRN CM suggesting, in 2D cultures as well, a higher differentiation level in the presence of L-WRN CM. In conclusion, rabbit caecum organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium were more proliferative and less differentiated than organoids cultured with L-WRN CM. We propose that organoids cultured with the 2Ki medium could be used to rapidly generate in vitro a large number of rabbit intestinal epithelial stem cells while organoids cultured with the L-WRN CM used at low concentration represent a suitable model to study differentiated rabbit epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of persistent HIV-1 Envelope (Env) specific antibody (Ab) is a primary goal of HIV vaccine strategies; however, it is unclear whether HIV Env immunization in humans induces bone marrow plasma cells, the presumed source of long-lived systemic Ab. To define the features of Env-specific plasma cells after vaccination, samples were obtained from HVTN 105, a phase I trial testing the same gp120 protein immunogen, AIDSVAX B/E, used in RV144, along with a DNA immunogen in various prime and boost strategies. Boosting regimens that included AIDSVAX B/E induced robust peripheral blood plasmablast responses. The Env-specific immunoglobulin repertoire of the plasmablasts is dominated by VH1 gene usage and targeting of the V3 region. Numerous plasmablast-derived immunoglobulin lineages persisted in the bone marrow >8 months after immunization, including in the CD138+ long-lived plasma cell compartment. These findings identify a cellular linkage for the development of sustained Env-specific Abs following vaccination in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Cell transplantation for spinal cord injury (SCI) has largely been studied in sub-acute settings within 1–2 weeks of injury. In contrast, here we transplanted skin-derived precursors differentiated into Schwann cells (SKP-SCs) into the contused rat spinal cord 8 weeks post-injury (wpi). Twenty-one weeks later (29 wpi), SKP-SCs were found to have survived transplantation, integrated with host tissue, and mitigated the formation of a dense glial scar. Furthermore, transplanted SKP-SCs filled much of the lesion sites and greatly enhanced the presence of endogenous SCs, which myelinated thousands of sprouting/spared host axons in and around the injury site. In addition, SKP-SC transplantation improved locomotor outcomes and decreased pathological thickening of bladder wall. To date, functional improvements have very rarely been observed with cell transplantation beyond the sub-acute stage of injury. Hence, these findings indicate that skin-derived SCs are a promising candidate cell type for the treatment of chronic SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) serve as the connection between the eye and the brain, with this connection disrupted in glaucoma. Numerous cellular mechanisms have been associated with glaucomatous neurodegeneration, and useful cellular models of glaucoma allow for the precise analysis of degenerative phenotypes. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) serve as powerful tools for studying human disease, particularly cellular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Thus, efforts focused upon hPSCs with an E50K mutation in the Optineurin (OPTN) gene, a leading cause of inherited forms of glaucoma. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing introduced the OPTN(E50K) mutation into existing lines of hPSCs, as well as generating isogenic controls from patient-derived lines. RGCs differentiated from OPTN(E50K) hPSCs exhibited numerous neurodegenerative deficits, including neurite retraction, autophagy dysfunction, apoptosis, and increased excitability. These results demonstrate the utility of OPTN(E50K) RGCs as an in vitro model of neurodegeneration, with the opportunity to develop novel therapeutic approaches for glaucoma.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNA-mediated RNA silencing is an important antiviral mechanism in higher plants. It has been shown that RNA silencing components can be upregulated by viral infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the upregulation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that jasmonate (JA) signaling transcriptionally activates Argonaute 18 (AGO18), a core RNA silencing component that promotes rice antiviral defense through sequestering miR168 and miR528, which repress key antiviral defense proteins. Mechanistically, the JA-responsive transcription factor JAMYB directly binds to the AGO18 promoter to activate AGO18 transcription. Rice stripe virus (RSV) coat protein (CP) triggers JA accumulation and upregulates JAMYB to initiate this host defense network. Our study reveals that regulatory crosstalk exists between the JA signaling and antiviral RNA silencing pathways and elucidates a molecular mechanism for CP-mediated viral resistance in monocot crops.

Abstract: Summary
Arginyltransferase ATE1 mediates posttranslational arginylation and plays key roles in multiple physiological processes. ATE1 utilizes arginyl (Arg)-tRNAArg as the donor of Arg, putting this reaction into a direct competition with the protein synthesis machinery. Here, we address the question of ATE1- Arg-tRNAArg specificity as a potential mechanism enabling this competition in vivo. Using in vitro arginylation assays and Ate1 knockout models, we find that, in addition to full-length tRNA, ATE1 is also able to utilize short tRNAArg fragments that bear structural resemblance to tRNA-derived fragments (tRF), a recently discovered class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs with global emerging biological role. Ate1 knockout cells show a decrease in tRFArg generation and a significant increase in the ratio of tRNAArg:tRFArg compared with wild type, suggesting a functional link between tRFArg and arginylation. We propose that generation of physiologically important tRFs can serve as a switch between translation and protein arginylation.

Abstract: Summary
Generating sufficient antibody to block infection is a key challenge for vaccines against malaria. Here, we show that antibody titers to a key target, the repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), plateaued after two immunizations in a clinical trial of the radiation-attenuated sporozoite vaccine. To understand the mechanisms limiting vaccine responsiveness, we developed immunoglobulin (Ig)-knockin mice with elevated numbers of PfCSP-binding B cells. We determined that recall responses were inhibited by antibody feedback, potentially via epitope masking of the immunodominant PfCSP repeat region. Importantly, the amount of antibody that prevents boosting is below the amount of antibody required for protection. Finally, while antibody feedback limited responses to the PfCSP repeat region in vaccinated volunteers, potentially protective subdominant responses to PfCSP C-terminal regions expanded with subsequent boosts. These data suggest that antibody feedback drives the diversification of immune responses and that vaccination for malaria will require targeting multiple antigens.

Light-mediated chemical reactions are powerful methods for manipulating and interrogating biological systems. Photosensitizers, compounds that generate reactive oxygen species upon excitation with light, can be utilized for numerous biological experiments, but the repertoire of bioavailable photosensitizers is limited. Here, we describe the synthesis, characterization, and utility of two photosensitizers based upon the widely used rhodamine scaffold and demonstrate their efficacy for chromophore-assisted light inactivation, cell ablation in culture and in vivo, and photopolymerization of diaminobenzidine for electron microscopy. These chemical tools will facilitate a broad range of applications spanning from targeted destruction of proteins to high-resolution imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Although there is no effective cure for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, antibodies are protective and correlate with recovery from infection. To examine the human antibody response to HBV, we screened 124 vaccinated and 20 infected, spontaneously recovered individuals. The selected individuals produced shared clones of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that targeted 3 non-overlapping epitopes on the HBV S antigen (HBsAg). Single bNAbs protected humanized mice against infection but selected for resistance mutations in mice with prior established infection. In contrast, infection was controlled by a combination of bNAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes with complementary sensitivity to mutations that commonly emerge during human infection. The co-crystal structure of one of the bNAbs with an HBsAg peptide epitope revealed a stabilized hairpin loop. This structure, which contains residues frequently mutated in clinical immune escape variants, provides a molecular explanation for why immunotherapy for HBV infection may require combinations of complementary bNAbs.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in shaping the invasive cancer phenotype by contributing to tumor initiation, metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand activated transcription factor, which is well known for mediating the toxicity and tumorigenesis of a variety of environmental pollutants, has been extensively recognized as an important mediator in NSCLC development. Here, evidence showed that AhR was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, and a high AhR protein level was associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype. Knockdown of AhR suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration, as well as CSC-like properties, while upregulation and activation of AhR enhanced CSC-like properties and increased stem cell-associated gene expression in NSCLC cells. Elevated and activated AhR leads to phosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (Jak2), as well as its downstream effector, activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), while inhibition of Jak2/STAT3 signaling by pharmacologic approach attenuates the effects of AhR-mediated NSCLC cell stemness, suggesting a role for the Jak2/STAT3 pathway in AhR-regulated NSCLC stemness. In summary, our study uncovers a transcriptional-independent mechanism of AhR through which AhR mediates NSCLC stemness via Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway, indicating a promising target for the treatment of NSCLC.

Abstract: MyD88 has been implicated in the tumourigenesis, metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer (BC). Here we utilized TJ-M2010-2 (TJ), an inhibitor of MyD88 homodimerimerization, and siMyD88 to suppress the function of MyD88 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. BC cells were treated in vitro and xenografted into nude mice to generate a model in vivo. TJ inhibited BC cell growth by impeding proliferation rather than by promoting apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, TJ and siMyD88 significantly attenuated cell migration and invasion, inhibited EMT-like progression and reduced cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1 and TNF-α) secretion induced by LPS. In vivo, TJ significantly hindered tumour growth in mice. Notably, TJ also decreased the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1, and TNF-α and M2 macrophage infiltration in the tumour microenvironment. The expression of MyD88, TRAF6, NF-κB p65, Snail, MMP-2, MMP-9, p-GSK-3β and p-Akt was significantly downregulated by TJ in BC cells and tumour tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that a MyD88 inhibitor (TJ) may be a promising therapeutic modality for treating BC patients.

Abstract: Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been implicated in the development of various cancers. PRMT2, a member of the type I PRMT family, is overexpressed in multiple tumors. However, the expression and role of PRMT2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been studied. Here, we discovered that PRMT2 expression is elevated in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding non-tumor tissues, and PRMT2 overexpression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Depletion of PRMT2 in HCC cell lines inhibited their cell growth and induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that PRMT2 is responsible for H3R8 asymmetric methylation (H3R8me2a). H3R8me2a enrichment at the Bcl2 promoter increases its accessibility to STAT3, promoting Bcl2 gene expression. In addition, our results confirmed that the catalytically inactive mutant of PRMT2 or the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 impaired the pro-tumorigenic functions of PRMT2 in HCC cells. Overall, our findings showed that PRMT2 functions as an oncogenic gene in HCC, revealing its potential as a novel therapeutic target in HCC.

Abstract: Background
This study was aimed to identify an accurate gene expression signature to predict overall survival (OS) in patients with ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods
Expression data and corresponding clinical information were obtained from two independent databases: the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset. Multiple analysis methods including univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis were utilized to build the signature. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses were used to assess the predictive accuracy of this gene signature.
Results
A novel 10-gene signature with high predictive accuracy for OS in OC patients was constructed and validated in the training and validation set. Based on the results of univariate and multivariate analyses, the presence of risk Score was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of OC patients. Moreover, we developed a nomogram model based on these 10 genes in the signature, which also displayed a favorable predictive efficacy for prognosis in OC.
Conclusions

Abstract: Summary
Pericytes (PCs) have been reported to contribute to the mechanoregulation of the capillary diameter and blood flow in health and disease. How this is realized remains poorly understood. We designed several models representing basement membrane (BM) in between PCs and endothelial cells (ECs). These models captured a unique protein organization with micron-sized FN patches surrounded by laminin (LM) and allowed to obtain quantitative information on PC morphology and contractility. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived PCs, we could address mechanical aspects of mid-capillary PC behavior in vitro. Our results showed that PCs strongly prefer FN patches over LM for adhesion formation, have an optimal stiffness for spreading in the range of EC rigidity, and react in a non-canonical way with increased traction forces and reduced spreading on other stiffness then the optimal. Our approach opens possibilities to further study PC force regulation under well-controlled conditions.

Abstract: The study of human midbrain development and midbrain related diseases, like Parkinson’s disease (PD), is limited by deficiencies in the currently available and validated laboratory models. Three dimensional midbrain organoids represent an innovative strategy to recapitulate some aspects of the complexity and physiology of the human midbrain. Nevertheless, also these novel organoid models exhibit some inherent weaknesses, including the presence of a necrotic core and batch-to-batch variability. Here we describe an optimized approach for the standardized generation of midbrain organoids that addresses these limitations, while maintaining key features of midbrain development like dopaminergic neuron and astrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we have established a novel time-efficient, fit for purpose analysis pipeline and provided proof of concept for its usage by investigating toxin induced PD.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus is important for memory formation and is severely affected in the brain with Alzheimer disease (AD). Our understanding of early pathogenic processes occurring in hippocampi in AD is limited due to tissue unavailability. Here, we report a chemical approach to rapidly generate free-floating hippocampal spheroids (HSs), from human induced pluripotent stem cells. When used to model AD, both APP and atypical PS1 variant HSs displayed increased Aβ42/Aβ40 peptide ratios and decreased synaptic protein levels, which are common features of AD. However, the two variants differed in tau hyperphosphorylation, protein aggregation, and protein network alterations. NeuroD1-mediated gene therapy in HSs-derived progenitors resulted in modulation of expression of numerous genes, including those involved in synaptic transmission. Thus, HSs can be harnessed to unravel the mechanisms underlying early pathogenic changes in the hippocampi of AD patients, and provide a robust platform for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting early stage AD.

Abstract: Summary
Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous mold, is a common cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients. Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically antiviral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1 and Card9- and type I and III interferon signaling-dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.
