Abstract: Cellular environments are highly complex and contain a copious variety of proteins that must operate in unison to achieve homeostasis. To guide and preserve order, multifaceted molecular chaperone networks are present within each cell type. To handle the vast client diversity and regulatory demands, a wide assortment of chaperones are needed. In addition to the classic heat shock proteins, cochaperones with inherent chaperoning abilities (e.g., p23, Hsp40, Cdc37, etc.) are likely used to complete a system. In this review, we focus on the HSP90-associated cochaperones and provide evidence supporting a model in which select cochaperones are used to differentially modulate target proteins, contribute to combinatorial client regulation, and increase the overall reach of a cellular molecular chaperone network. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction and degeneration. DJ-1/PARK7 mutations have been linked with a familial form of early onset PD. In this study, we found that human DJ-1 wild type and the missense mutants M26I, R98Q, A104T and D149A were stable proteins in cells, only the L166P mutant was unstable. In parallel, the former were not degraded and the L166P mutant was directly degraded in vitro by proteasome-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, genetic evidence in fission yeast showed the direct involvement of proteasome in the degradation of human DJ-1 L166P and the corresponding L169P mutant of SPAC22E12.03c, the human orthologue of DJ-1 in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe, as their protein levels were increased at restrictive temperature in fission yeast (mts4 and pts1-732) harboring temperature sensitive mutations in proteasomal subunits. In total, our results provide evidence that direct proteasomal endoproteolytic cleavage of DJ-1 L166P is the mechanism of degradation contributing to the loss-of-function of the mutant protein, a property not shared by other DJ-1 missense mutants associated with PD.

Abstract: Glucose is the physiological stimulus for insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. The uptake and phosphorylation of glucose initiate and control downstream pathways, resulting in insulin secretion. However, the temporal coordination of these events in beta cells is not fully understood. The recent development of the FLII12Pglu-700μ-δ6 glucose nanosensor facilitates real-time analysis of intracellular glucose within a broad concentration range. Using this fluorescence-based technique, we show the shift in intracellular glucose concentration upon external supply and removal in primary mouse beta cells with high resolution. Glucose influx, efflux, and metabolism rates were calculated from the time-dependent plots. Comparison of insulin-producing cells with different expression levels of glucose transporters and phosphorylating enzymes showed that a high glucose influx rate correlated with GLUT2 expression, but was largely also sustainable by high GLUT1 expression. In contrast, in cells not expressing the glucose sensor enzyme glucokinase glucose metabolism was slow. We found no evidence of oscillations of the intracellular glucose concentration in beta cells. Concomitant real-time analysis of glucose and calcium dynamics using FLII12Pglu-700μ-δ6 and fura-2-acetoxymethyl-ester determined a glucose threshold of 4mM for the [Ca2+]i increase in beta cells. Indeed, a glucose concentration of 7mM had to be reached to evoke large amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations. The KATP channel closing agent glibenclamide was not able to induce large amplitude [Ca2+]i oscillations in the absence of glucose. Our findings suggest that glucose has to reach a threshold to evoke the [Ca2+]i increase and subsequently initiate [Ca2+]i oscillations in a KATP channel independent manner.

Abstract: Most mitochondrial membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and must be delivered to the organelle in an unfolded, import competent form. In mammalian cells, the cytosolic chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70 are part of a large cytosolic complex that deliver the membrane protein to the mitochondrion by docking with the import receptor Tom70. These two abundant chaperones have other functions in the cell suggesting that the specificity for the targeting of mitochondrial proteins requires the addition of specific factors within the targeting complex. We identify Tom34 as a cochaperone of Hsp70/Hsp90 in mitochondrial protein import. We show that Tom34 is an integral component with Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the large complex. We also demonstrate the role of Tom34 in the mitochondrial import process, as the addition of an excess of Tom34 prevents efficient mitochondrial translocation of precursor proteins that have requirements for Hsp70/Hsp90. Tom34 exhibits an affinity for mitochondrial preproteins of the Tom70 translocation pathway as demonstrated by binding assays using in vitro translated proteins as baits. In addition, we examined the specificity and the size of different complex cytosolic machines. Separation of different radiolabeled cell-free translated proteins on Native-PAGE showed the presence of a high molecular weight complex which binds hydrophobic proteins. Importantly we show that the formation of the chaperone cytosolic complex that mediates the targeting of proteins to the mitochondria contains Tom34 and assembles in the presence of a fully translated substrate protein.

Abstract: Metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) is a zinc finger protein that activates transcription in response to heavy metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II) and Cu(I) and is also involved in the response to hypoxia and oxidative stress. MTF-1 recognizes a specific DNA sequence motif termed the metal response element (MRE), located in the promoter/enhancer region of its target genes. The functional domains of MTF-1 include, besides the DNA-binding and activation domains and signals for subcellular localization (NLS and NES), a cysteine cluster 632CQCQCAC638 located near the C-terminus. Here we show that this cysteine cluster mediates homodimerization of human MTF-1, and that dimer formation in vivo is important for basal and especially metal-induced transcriptional activity. Neither nuclear translocation nor DNA binding is impaired in a mutant protein in which these cysteines are replaced by alanines. Although zinc supplementation induces MTF-1 dependent transcription it does not per se enhance dimerization, implying that actual zinc sensing is mediated by another domain. By contrast copper, which on its own activates MTF-1 only weakly in the cell lines tested, stabilizes the dimer by inducing intermolecular disulfide bond formation and synergizes with zinc to boost MTF-1 dependent transcription.

Abstract: The mesenchymal mode of cancer cell invasion characterized by active adhesion turnover and a polarized actin cytoskeleton, is critically regulated by the adaptor protein NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L. While it is known that NEDD9 is subject to extensive phosphorylation modification, the molecules that determine NEDD9 phosphorylation to stimulate adhesion turnover and mesenchymal cell morphologies are currently unknown. Earlier studies have suggested that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A regulates interconversion between a low molecular mass NEDD9 phosphoform and higher molecular mass phosphoforms. However, previous studies have used chemical inhibitors to block PP2A activity. In the present study we therefore aimed to specifically inhibit PP2A activity via siRNA and dominant negative approaches to investigate the effect of PP2A on interconversion between 115kDa and 105kDa NEDD9 and determine the functional consequence of PP2A activity for NEDD9 function. Strikingly, we find that while the phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A indeed abrogates detachment-induced dephosphorylation of the 115kDa NEDD9 phosphoform, PP2A depletion does not inhibit 115kDa to 105kDa interconversion. Our data suggest instead that PP2A targets discrete NEDD9 phosphorylation modifications separate to the events that mediate interconversion between the two forms. Functionally, PP2A depletion increases NEDD9 mediated cell spreading and mutation of S369 in the serine-rich region of NEDD9 to aspartate mimics this effect. Importantly, mutation of S369 to alanine abrogates the ability of dominant negative PP2A to increase NEDD9-mediated cell spreading. Collectively, our data reveal that the tumour suppressor PP2A may act via S369 to regulated NEDD9-mediated cell spreading.

Abstract: GATA4 has been characterized as a crucial regulator of cardiac development and hypertrophy. Multiple signaling pathways involving MAPK contribute to GATA4 activation via direct phosphorylation. MSK and RSK are two kinase families mediating signal transduction downstream of the MAPK cascade. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSK and RSK on GATA4 activation. Overexpression of RSK2 greatly increased phosphorylation of GATA4 at Ser261. This phosphorylation enhanced its transcriptional and DNA binding activity. RSK-dependent phosphorylation of GATA4 also led to enhanced interaction with NKX2.5 and p300. Sequential phosphorylation of the ERK–RSK–GATA4 cascade and nuclear accumulation of RSK in cardiomyocytes were observed after phenylephrine treatment. Inhibition of RSK using the small molecule SL0101 abrogated GATA4 phosphorylation at Ser261, ultimately leading to a repression of fetal cardiac genes. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MSK1 had no direct effect on GATA4 phosphorylation but increased GATA4 expression. Together with GATA4 phosphorylation at Ser105 by ERK1/2, our findings show dual phosphorylation of GATA4 by the ERK–RSK cascade and suggest that MSK and RSK have distinct effects in PE-induced cardiac hypertrophic response.

Abstract: It has been known that the inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is one of the earliest events occurring under hypoxia and this inhibition can lead to neuronal damages. Thus, the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor sodium cyanide (NaCN) is widely used to produce a model of chemical hypoxia by inhibiting this enzyme. However, the downstream signaling pathways of the inhibition of the cytochrome c oxidase remain to be studied. In the present paper, we used sodium cyanide to mimic the inhibition of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and studied its effect on glutamate release in synaptosomes from the prefrontal cortex using on-line fluorimetry. We also further investigated the mechanisms underlying the enhancing effect of sodium cyanide on glutamate release using pharmacological approaches combined with other techniques. The results showed that sodium cyanide significantly increased glutamate release from synaptosomes of prefrontal cortex; the broad-spectrum free radical scavenger MnTBAP and melatonin completely abolished the effect of sodium cyanide on glutamate release; the H2O2–NMDA receptor pathway mediated one part, whereas the lipid peroxyl radicals-ATP synthase pathway mediated another part of the sodium cyanide-induced glutamate release; scavenging H2O2 and enhancing ATP synthase activity could completely abolish the sodium cyanide-induced glutamate release.

Abstract: TRAF6 plays a crucial role in signal transduction of the Toll-like receptor (TLR). It has been reported that TRAF6 catalyzes the formation of unique Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which do not lead to proteasome-mediated degradation. Here we found that stimulation of J774.1 cells with various TLR ligands led to decreases in TRAF6 protein levels that occurred at a slower rate than IκBα degradation. The decrease in TRAF6 was inhibited by proteasome inhibitors MG-132, lactacystin and N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. Among intracellular TLR signaling molecules MyD88, IRAK-4, IRAK-1, TRAF6, and IKKβ, only IRAK-1 expression downregulated TRAF6 in HEK293 cells. The amount of TRAF6 expressed either transiently or stably was also reduced by co-expression of IRAK-1 and no TRAF6 cleavage products were detected. The levels of either a TRAF6 N-terminal deletion mutant or a ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant were not affected by IRAK-1 expression. Downregulation of TRAF6 required the TRAF6-binding site (Glu544, Glu587, Glu706) of IRAK-1 but not its catalytic site (Asp340). Upon IRAK-1 transfection, no significant TRAF6 ubiquitination was detected. Instead, TRAF6-associated IRAK-1 was ubiquitinated with both Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. TRAF6 downregulation was inhibited by co-expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 3, whose Lys63-linked polyubiquitination on IRAK-1 is reported to compete with Lys48-linked IRAK-1 polyubiquitination. Expression of IRAK-1 inhibited IκBα phosphorylation in response to TLR2 stimulation. These results indicate that stimulation of TLRs induces proteasome-dependent downregulation of TRAF6. We conclude that TRAF6 associated with ubiquitinated IRAK-1 is degraded together by the proteasome and that IRAK-1 possesses a negative regulatory role on TLR signaling.

Abstract: α-Lipoic acid (LA) has been shown to improve the diabetic cardiac symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated precisely. We have reported recently that LA potentially protected neurons from substance-induced apoptosis. We hypothesized that LA could attenuate cardiac cells death induced by oxidative stress derived from high glucose. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of LA on d-glucose/glucose oxidase (DG/GO, 30mM/5mU)-induced injury in rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. We observed that LA pretreatment significantly increased cell viability in DG/GO-challenged cells. LA pretreatment also attenuated DG/GO-induced apoptosis as evidenced by decreases in both nuclear condensation and loss of mitochondrial potential. In addition, LA activated ERK1/2 and moderately increased ROS production. Blockade of ERK1/2 activation by PD98059 completely abolished LA-induced protection against DG/GO challenge. Inhibition of ROS by N-acetylcysteine abrogated LA-induced ERK1/2 activation and cytoprotection. Furthermore, we observed that the ROS production induced by LA was significantly slower and milder than that by DG/GO. Our results suggest that pretreatment with LA moderately increased ROS production to induce a preconditioning-like effect by ERK1/2 activation thereby increased tolerance of H9c2 cells to DG/GO challenge.

Abstract: Catalase is sorted to peroxisomes via a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1), which binds to the receptor protein Pex5. Analysis of the C-terminal sequences of peroxisomal catalases from various species indicated that catalase never contains the typical C-terminal PTS1 tripeptide‐SKL, but invariably is sorted to peroxisomes via a non-canonical sorting sequence. We analyzed the relevance of the non-canonical PTS1 of catalase of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha (‐SKI). Using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, we show that the affinity of H. polymorpha Pex5 for a peptide containing ‐SKI at the C-terminus is 8-fold lower relative to a peptide that has a C-terminal ‐SKL. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that green fluorescent protein containing the ‐SKI tripeptide (GFP-SKI) has a prolonged residence time in the cytosol compared to GFP containing ‐SKL. Replacing the ‐SKI sequence of catalase into ‐SKL resulted in reduced levels of enzymatically active catalase in whole cell lysates together with the occurrence of catalase protein aggregates in the peroxisomal matrix. Moreover, the cultures showed a reduced growth yield in methanol-limited chemostats. Finally, we show that a mutant catalase variant that is unable to properly fold mislocalizes in protein aggregates in the cytosol. However, by replacing the PTS1 into ‐SKL the mutant variant accumulates in protein aggregates inside peroxisomes. Based on our findings we propose that the relatively weak PTS1 of catalase is important to allow proper folding of the enzyme prior to import into peroxisomes, thereby preventing the accumulation of catalase protein aggregates in the organelle matrix.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidases play critical roles in signalling and development. Given the high toxicity of ROS, their production is tightly regulated. In Arabidopsis, respiratory burst oxidase homologue F (AtrbohF) encodes NADPH oxidase. Here we characterised the activation of AtRbohF using a heterologous expression system. AtRbohF exhibited ROS-producing activity that was synergistically activated by protein phosphorylation and Ca2+. The two EF-hand motifs of AtRbohF in the N-terminal cytosolic region were crucial for its Ca2+-dependent activation. AtrbohD and AtrbohF are involved in stress responses. Although the activation mechanisms for AtRbohD and AtRbohF were similar, AtRbohD had significantly greater ROS-producing activity than AtRbohF, which may reflect their functional diversity, at least in part. We further characterised the interrelationship between Ca2+ and phosphorylation regarding activation and found that protein phosphorylation-induced activation was independent of Ca2+. In contrast, K-252a, a protein kinase inhibitor, inhibited the Ca2+-dependent ROS-producing activity of AtRbohD and AtRbohF in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that protein phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the Ca2+-dependent activation of Rboh. Positive feedback regulation of Ca2+ and ROS through AtRbohC has been proposed to play a critical role in root hair tip growth. Our findings suggest that Rboh phosphorylation is the initial trigger for the plant Ca2+-ROS signalling network.

Abstract: Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram (PCH) analysis are powerful ways to study mobility and stoichiometry of G protein coupled receptor complexes, within microdomains of single living cells. However, relating these properties to molecular mechanisms can be challenging. We investigated the influence of β-arrestin adaptors and endocytosis mechanisms on plasma membrane diffusion and particle brightness of GFP-tagged neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors. A novel GFP-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) system also identified Y1 receptor-β-arrestin complexes. Diffusion co-efficients (D) for Y1 and Y2-GFP receptors in HEK293 cell plasma membranes were 2.22 and 2.15×10−9cm2s−1 respectively. At a concentration which promoted only Y1 receptor endocytosis, NPY treatment reduced Y1-GFP motility (D 1.48×10−9cm2s−1), but did not alter diffusion characteristics of the Y2-GFP receptor. Agonist induced changes in Y1 receptor motility were inhibited by mutations (6A) which prevented β-arrestin recruitment and internalisation; conversely they became apparent in a Y2 receptor mutant with increased β-arrestin affinity. NPY treatment also increased Y1 receptor-GFP particle brightness, changes which indicated receptor clustering, and which were abolished by the 6A mutation. The importance of β-arrestin recruitment for these effects was illustrated by reduced lateral mobility (D 1.20–1.33×10−9cm2s−1) of Y1 receptor-β-arrestin BiFC complexes. Thus NPY-induced changes in Y receptor motility and brightness reflect early events surrounding arrestin dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane, results supported by a novel combined BiFC/FCS approach to detect the underlying receptor-β-arrestin signalling complex.

Abstract: Epigenetic changes of genomic DNA are involved in the development and progression of many cancers. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of certain tumor-suppressor genes (TSG) is frequently observed in cancer cells. Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10), a member of the cadherin superfamily, is a recently identified putative TSG. PCDH10 is frequently silenced in many solid tumors. However, the role of PCDH10 in gastric cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the expression and methylation status of PCDH10 in gastric cancer cells and tissues by real time PCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and then investigated the biological function of PCDH10. We found that the expression of PCDH10 was markedly reduced in gastric cancer cells and tissues. The reduced expression correlated with hypermethylation of this gene in its promoter region, as demonstrated by MSP and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) analysis. In addition, pharmacological demethylation using 5-Aza restored the expression of PCDH10 in gastric cancer cells. Over-expression of PCDH10 in gastric cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and migration, but did not cause marked apoptosis. Over-expression of PCDH10 also suppressed growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. Thus, PCDH10 functions as a TSG in gastric cancer, and might be a useful target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Down-regulation of hMSH3 is associated with elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats and low levels of microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism that down-regulates hMSH3 in CRC is not known. In this study, a significant association between over-expression of glucose transporter 1, a marker for hypoxia, and down-regulation of hMSH3 in CRC tissues was observed. Therefore, we examined the effect of hypoxia on the expression of hMSH3 in human cell lines. When cells with wild type p53 (wt-p53) were exposed to hypoxia, rapid down-regulation of both hMSH2 and hMSH3 occurred. In contrast, when null or mutated p53 (null/mut-p53) cells were exposed to hypoxia, only hMSH3 was down-regulated, and at slower rate than wt-p53 cells. Using a reporter assay, we found that disruption of the two putative hypoxia response elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of the hMSH3 abrogated the suppressive effect of hypoxia on reporter activity regardless of p53 status. In an EMSA, two different forms of HIF-1α complexes that specifically bind to these HREs were detected. A larger complex containing HIF-1α predominantly bound to the HREs in hypoxic null/mut-p53 cells whereas a smaller complex predominated in wt-p53 cells. Finally, HIF-1α knockdown by siRNA significantly inhibited down-regulation of hMSH3 by hypoxia in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the binding of HIF-1α complexes to HRE sites is necessary for down-regulation of hMSH3 in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cells.

Abstract: A pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the aggregation of proteins. Protein aggregate formation may be linked to a failure of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and/or the autophagy pathway. The UPS involves the ubiquitination of proteins followed by proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitination of target proteins is performed by proteases called deubiquitinating proteins (DUBs). Inhibition of DUBs may lead to the dysregulation of homeostasis and have pathological consequences. To assess the effects of DUB-inhibition, we have used the oligodendroglial cell line, OLN-t40, stably expressing the longest human tau isoform. Cells were incubated with PR-619, a broad-range, reversible inhibitor of ubiquitin isopeptidases. Incubation with PR-619 led to morphological changes, the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSP), including HSP70 and αB-crystallin, and to protein aggregates near the MTOC, containing ubiquitin, HSPs, and the ubiquitin binding protein p62, which may provide a link between the UPS and autophagy. Thus, inhibition of DUB activity caused stress responses and the formation of protein aggregates resembling pathological inclusions observed in aggregopathies. Furthermore, PR-619 led to the stabilization of the microtubule network, possibly through the modulation of tau phosphorylation, and small tau deposits assembled near the MTOC. Hence, organization and integrity of the cytoskeleton were affected, which is particularly important for the maintenance of the cellular architecture and intracellular transport processes, and essential for the functionality and survival of neural cells. Our data demonstrate that DUB inhibitors provide a useful tool to elucidate the manifold mechanisms of DUB functions in cells and their dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: MMP-11 (stromelysin-3) is a matrix metalloproteinase associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its expression was initially described exclusively in stromal cells surrounding tumors, but more recently it has also been detected in macrophages and hepatocarcinoma cells. Here we show MMP-11 expression in human epithelial colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (Caco-2, HT-29 and BCS-TC2). Treatment of BCS-TC2 cells with butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) (histone deacetylase inhibitors) increases MMP11 promoter activity and protein expression. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and supershift assays, we demonstrate for the first time that Sp1 is able to bind to the GC-boxes within the MMP11 proximal promoter region; this binding has been confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Sp1 is involved in MMP11 basal expression and it is essential for the upregulation of transcription by histone deacetylase inhibitors as deduced from mutant constructs lacking the Sp1 sites and by inhibition of its binding to the promoter with mithramycin. This regulation requires the formation of Sp1/Smad2 heterocomplexes, which is stimulated by an increase in the acetylation status of Smad after butyrate or TSA treatments. We have also found that ERK1/2-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not p38-MAPK or JNK, is involved in the upregulation of MMP11 by HDAC inhibitors.

Abstract: We previously reported the expression of angiopoietin receptor Tie2 on human neutrophils. Both angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2) induce platelet activating factor (PAF) synthesis from endothelial cells (ECs) and neutrophils. Both angiopoietins can also modulate EC viability and since PAF can promote pro-survival activity on neutrophils, we addressed whether Ang1 and/or Ang2 could modulate neutrophil viability. Neutrophils were isolated from venous blood of healthy volunteers and neutrophil viability was assessed by flow cytometry using apoptotic and necrotic markers (annexin-V and propidium iodide (P.I.), respectively). Basal neutrophil viability from 0 to 24h post-isolation decreased from 98% to ≈45%. Treatment with anti-apoptotic mediators such as interleukin-8 (IL-8; 25nM) and PAF (100nM) increased neutrophil basal viability by 34 and 26% (raising it from 43 to 58 and 55%) respectively. Treatment with Ang1 (0.001–50nM) increased neutrophil viability by up to 41%, while Ang2 had no significant effect. Combination of IL-8 (25nM) or PAF (100nM) with Ang1 (10nM) further increased neutrophil viability by 56 and 60% respectively. We also observed that Ang1, but not Ang2 can promote IL-8 release and that a pretreatment of the neutrophils with blocking anti-IL-8 antibodies inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-8 and Ang1 by 92 and 81% respectively. Pretreatment with a selective PAF receptor antagonist (BN 52021), did abrogate PAF pro-survival activity, without affecting Ang1-induced neutrophil viability. Our data are the first ones to report Ang1 pro-survival activity on neutrophils, which is mainly driven through IL-8 release.

Abstract: Zinc dyshomeostasis can induce cell death. However, the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability. Here, we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione (ZP) and the chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC3, DU145) and androgen-sensitive (C4-2) PCa cell-lines. Compared to PCa cells, RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN, but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly. ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP, but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected. The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed. ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK, AKT and PKC phosphorylation. DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN. TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage, DNA-fragmentation, ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies. PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors, and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death. Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both. Cell death in response to TPEN (but not ZP) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Overall, the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN. The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is an exceedingly lethal disease with a five-year survival that ranks among the lowest of gastrointestinal malignancies. Part of its lethality is attributable to a generally poor response to existing chemotherapeutic regimens. New therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. We aimed to elucidate the anti-neoplastic mechanisms of apigenin—an abundant, naturally-occurring plant flavonoid—with a particular focus on p53 function. Pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2) experienced dose and time-dependent growth inhibition and increased apoptosis with apigenin treatment. p53 post-translational modification, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and upregulation of p21 and PUMA were all enhanced by apigenin treatment despite mutated p53 in both cell lines. Transcription-dependent p53 activity was reversed by pifithrin-α, a specific DNA binding inhibitor of p53, but not growth inhibition or apoptosis suggesting transcription-independent p53 activity. This was supported by immunoprecipitation assays which demonstrated disassociation of p53/BclXL and PUMA/BclXL and formation of complexes with Bak followed by cytochrome c release. Treated animals grew smaller tumors with increased cellular apoptosis than those fed control diet. These results suggest that despite deactivating mutation, p53 retains some of its function which is augmented following treatment with apigenin. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction may be mediated by transcription-independent p53 function via interactions with BclXL and PUMA. Further study of flavonoids as chemotherapeutics is warranted.

Abstract: In experimental membranous nephropathy, complement C5b-9 induces sublethal glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury and proteinuria. C5b-9 also activates mechanisms that restrict injury or facilitate recovery. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) selectively degrades damaged or abnormal proteins, while misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, we investigated the effect of complement on the UPS and ERAD. We monitored UPS function by transfection of rat GECs with a UPS reporter, GFPu (CL1 degron fused with green fluorescent protein). By analogy, CD3δ-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was employed as a reporter of ERAD. We demonstrated decreased GFPu levels in GECs after incubation with antibody and complement, compared with control. Using C8-deficient serum with or without purified C8, cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis), and the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, we confirmed that the decrease of GFPu was mediated by C5b-9, and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the reporter. Inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase attenuated the effect of complement on GFPu degradation. Complement, however, increased the level of CD3δ-YFP in GECs, implying an impairment of ERAD, likely due to an overabundance of misfolded proteins in the ER. The overall ubiquitination of proteins was enhanced in complement-treated GECs and in glomeruli of rats with experimental membranous nephropathy, although ubiquitin mRNA was unchanged in GECs. Proteasome inhibition with MG132 increased the cytotoxic effect of complement in GECs. Complement-stimulated UPS function, by accelerating removal of damaged proteins, may be a novel mechanism to limit complement-induced injury.

Abstract: The Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway (UPP) has become a target rich pathway for therapeutic intervention as its role in pathogenic disease is better understood. In particular many E3 ligases within this pathway have been implicated in cancer, inflammation and metabolic diseases. It has been of great interest to develop biochemical assays to identify inhibitors of catalytic E3 ubiquitination activity as a means of abrogating the disease mechanism. Here we describe a homogeneous biochemical assay that utilizes native ubiquitin and Tandem-repeated Ubiquitin-Binding Entities (TUBEs) as a detection technology for ubiquitination activity. We developed a TUBEs based proximity AlphaLisa® assay for Mdm2, which is an E3 ligase that negatively regulates p53 tumor suppressor protein. We further demonstrate that this assay strategy or design can also be applied to the development of assays to detect autoubiquitination of other E3 ligases that are also of interest for therapeutic intervention. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin Drug Discovery and Diagnostics.

Abstract: Protein degradation by the proteasome plays an important role in all major cellular pathways. Aberrant proteasome activity is associated with numerous human diseases including cancer and neurological disorders, but the underlying mechanism is virtually unclear. At least part of the reason for this is due to lack of understanding of the regulation of human proteasome genes. In this study, we found that a large set of human proteasome genes carry the CCAAT box in their promoters. We further demonstrated that the basal expression of these CCAAT box-containing proteasome genes is regulated by the transcription factor NF-Y. Knockdown of NF-YA, an essential subunit of NF-Y, reduced proteasome gene expression and compromised the cellular proteasome activity. In addition, we showed that knockdown of NF-YA sensitized breast cancer cells to the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This study unveils a new role for NF-Y in the regulation of human proteasome genes and suggests that NF-Y may be a potential target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to estimate the role played by cortisol, prolactin (PRL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the synthesis of adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) as compared to the well-studied regulation of β-casein synthesis by these hormones in the mammary epithelial cell line HC11. This comparison between a cytoplasmic lipid droplet-associated protein, which is strictly specific to both lipid accumulation and secretion by lactating mammary epithelial cells, and an archetypal milk protein is useful for evaluating the extent to which a mechanistic relationship exists between biosynthesis, transport and secretion of these two major milk components. We found that cortisol inhibits PRL-stimulated ADRP synthesis, as opposed to its known stimulating effect on β-casein synthesis. The involvement of PRL and EGF in ADRP synthesis was explored by means of a battery of inhibitors. The Jak2 inhibitor AG490 provoked a stimulation of ADRP synthesis whereas it totally suppressed that of β-casein. The use of AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor phosphorylation, or of PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, revealed that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway has no significant influence on ADRP levels. Inhibition of JNK was also ineffective. In contrast, incubation of the cells with SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, slightly stimulated ADRP synthesis and induced a proportional dose–response inhibition of PRL-induced β-casein synthesis. Finally, cell treatment with wortmannin or LY294002 revealed that both PRL and EGF positively regulate ADRP and β-casein synthesis through PI3-kinase signaling. Because both the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin provoked a strong diminution of PRL-induced synthesis of the two proteins, and because oleate induced phosphorylation of Akt, we concluded that, in the mammary epithelial cell line HC11, the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway strongly participates in β-casein synthesis and is a main regulator of ADRP expression.

Abstract: In human adenocarcinoma, claudin-2 expression is higher than that in normal lung tissue, but the regulatory mechanism of its expression has not been clarified. In human adenocarcinoma A549 cells, claudin-2 level time-dependently increased under the control conditions. In contrast, claudin-1 expression remained constant for 24h. The concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in medium time-dependently increased, which was inhibited by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor II, an inhibitor of MMP-1, 3, 7, and 9. MMP inhibitor II decreased claudin-2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) levels, which were recovered by EGF. Both claudin-2 and p-ERK1/2 levels were decreased by EGF neutralizing antibody, EGF receptor (EGFR) siRNA, AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR, U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, and the exogenous expression of dominant negative-MEK. These results suggest that EGF is secreted from A549 cells by MMP and increases claudin-2 expression mediated via the activation of an EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. The inhibition of the signaling pathway decreased phosphorylated c-Fos and nuclear c-Fos levels. The introduction of c-Fos siRNA decreased claudin-2 level without affecting claudin-1. The promoter activity of human claudin-2 was decreased by AG1478 and U0126. Furthermore, the activity was decreased by the deletion or mutation of the AP-1 binding site of claudin-2 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and avidin–biotin conjugated DNA assays showed that c-Fos binds to the AP-1 binding site. We suggest that a secreted EGF up-regulates the transcriptional activity of claudin-2 mediated by the activation of an EGFR/MEK/ERK/c-Fos pathway in A549 cells.

Abstract: This study demonstrated that exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) and protein kinase A (PKA) by 8-bromo (8-Br)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) stimulated [14C]-α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (α-MG) uptake through increased sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) expression and translocation to lipid rafts in renal proximal tubule cells (PTCs). In PTCs, SGLTs were colocalized with lipid raft caveolin-1 (cav-1), disrupted by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Selective activators of Epac or PKA, 8-Br-cAMP, and forskolin stimulated expressions of SGLTs and α-MG uptake in PTCs. In addition, 8-Br-cAMP-induced PKA and Epac activation increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which were involved in expressions of SGLTs. Furthermore, 8-Br-cAMP stimulated SGLTs translocation to lipid rafts via filamentous actin (F-actin) organization, which was blocked by cytochalasin D. In addition, cav-1 and SGLTs stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP were detected in lipid rafts, which were blocked by cytochalasin D. Furthermore, 8-Br-cAMP-induced SGLTs translocation and α-MG uptake were attenuated by inhibition of cav-1 activation with cav-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and inhibition of F-actin organization with TRIO and F-actin binding protein (TRIOBP). In conclusion, 8-Br-cAMP stimulated α-MG uptake via Epac and PKA-dependent SGLTs expression and trafficking through cav-1 and F-actin in PTCs.

Abstract: Glucose-regulated protein 94 is the HSP90-like protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore it chaperones secreted and membrane proteins. It has essential functions in development and physiology of multicellular organisms, at least in part because of this unique clientele. GRP94 shares many biochemical features with other HSP90 proteins, in particular its domain structure and ATPase activity, but also displays distinct activities, such as calcium binding, necessitated by the conditions in the endoplasmic reticulum. GRP94's mode of action varies from the general HSP90 theme in the conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding, and in its interactions with co-chaperones, which are very different from known cytosolic co-chaperones. GRP94 is more selective than many of the ER chaperones and the basis for this selectivity remains obscure. Recent development of molecular tools and functional assays has expanded the spectrum of clients that rely on GRP94 activity, but it is still not clear how the chaperone binds them, or what aspect of folding it impacts. These mechanistic questions and the regulation of GRP94 activity by other proteins and by post-translational modification differences pose new questions and present future research avenues. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90).

Abstract: Kv1.3 channels play an important role in modulating lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that Kv1.3 channels in B lymphocytes might be regulated by rituximab, an antibody to CD20, a drug for treatments of B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. Using both whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp techniques, we found that rituximab inhibited Kv1.3 channels in Daudi human B lymphoma cells by promoting the channel inactivation at a concentration which was much greater than that required for activation of CD20. The effect of rituximab on Kv1.3 channels was abolished after selective blockade of FcγRIIB receptors with anti-FcγRIIB antibody. Western blot experiments showed that Daudi B cells expressed both Kv1.3 channel and the low affinity Fc receptor, FcγRIIB, which could be activated by the Fc region of rituximab. In contrast, normal lymphocytes expressed less Kv1.3 channels with faster inactivation. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry data showed that rituximab induced apoptosis of Daudi B cells and that the effect was attenuated by blockade of FcγRIIB receptors and partially mimicked by inhibition of Kv1.3 channels. These results suggest that in addition to previously described complement-dependent cytotoxicity, rituximab also induces apoptosis of malignant B lymphocyte by stimulating FcγRIIB receptors and inhibiting Kv1.3 channels.

Abstract: Covalent conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins is a highly dynamic and reversible process. Cells maintain a fine-tuned balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation. In response to stress stimuli such as heat shock, this balance is altered resulting in a dramatic increase in the levels of SUMO conjugates. Whether this reflects an activation of the conjugation cascade, a decrease in the activity of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs), or both, remains unknown. Here, we show that from the five human SENPs detected in HeLa cells (SENP1/2/3/6/7) the activities of all but one (SENP6) were largely diminished after 30min of heat shock. The decreased activity is not due to changes in their steady-state levels. Rather, in vitro experiments suggest that these SENPs are intrinsically heat-sensitive, a property most likely emerging from their catalytic domains. Heat shock inactivation seems to be a specific property of SENPs because numerous members of the related deubiquitinase family of cysteine proteases are not affected by this stress condition. Overall, our results suggest that SENPs are particularly sensitive to heat shock, a property that may be important for the adaptation of cells to this stress condition.

Abstract: Objective: We investigated the effect of advanced glycated albumin (AGE-albumin) on macrophage sensitivity to inflammation elicited by S100B calgranulin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mechanism by which HDL modulates this response. We also measured the influence of the culture medium, isolated from macrophages treated with AGE-albumin, on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Methods and results: Macrophages were incubated with control (C) or AGE-albumin in the presence or absence of HDL, followed by incubations with S100B or LPS. Also, culture medium obtained from cells treated with C- or AGE-albumin, following S100B or LPS stimulation was utilized to treat naive macrophages in order to evaluate cholesterol efflux and the expression of HDL receptors. In comparison with C-albumin, AGE-albumin, promoted a greater secretion of cytokines after stimulation with S100B or LPS. A greater amount of cytokines was also produced by macrophages treated with AGE-albumin even in the presence of HDL. Cytokine-enriched medium, drawn from incubations with AGE-albumin and S100B or LPS impaired the cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I (23% and 37%, respectively), HDL2 (43% and 47%, respectively) and HDL3 (20% and 8.5%, respectively) and reduced ABCA-1 protein level (16% and 26%, respectively). Conclusions: AGE-albumin primes macrophages for an inflammatory response impairing the RCT. Moreover, AGE-albumin abrogates the anti-inflammatory role of HDL, which may aggravate the development of atherosclerosis in DM.

Abstract: We used the patch-clamp technique to study the effect of changing the external Ca2+ on the basolateral 50-pS K channel in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of rat kidney. Increasing the external Ca2+ concentration from 1mM to 2 or 3mM inhibited the basolateral 50-pS K channels while decreasing external Ca2+ to 10μM increased the 50-pS K channel activity. The effect of the external Ca2+ on the 50-pS K channels was observed only in cell-attached patches but not in excised patches. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of increasing external Ca2+ on the 50-pS K channels was absent in the presence of NPS2390, an antagonist of Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of the external Ca2+ was the result of stimulation of the CaSR. Application of the membrane-permeable cAMP analog increased the 50-pS K channel activity but did not block the effect of raising the external Ca2+ on the K channels. Neither inhibition of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) nor suppression of cytochrome P450-ω-hydroxylation-dependent metabolism of arachidonic acid was able to abolish the effect of raising the external Ca2+ on the 50-pS K channels. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) or blocking protein kinase C (PKC) completely abolished the inhibition of the basolateral 50-pS K channels induced by raising the external Ca2+. We conclude that the external Ca2+ concentration plays an important role in the regulation of the basolateral K channel activity in the TAL and that the effect of the external Ca2+ is mediated by the CaSR which stimulates PLC–PKC pathways. The regulation of the basolateral K channels by the CaSR may be the mechanism by which extracellular Ca2+ level modulates the reabsorption of divalent cations.

Identification of a nuclear carbonic anhydrase in Caenorhabditis elegans,

Abstract: Background
Carbonic anhydrases (CA) catalyze the inter-conversion of CO2 with HCO3 and H+, and are involved in a wide variety of physiologic processes such as anion transport, pH regulation, and water balance. In mammals there are sixteen members of the classical α-type CA family, while the simple genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans codes for six αCA isoforms (cah-1 through cah-6).
Methods
Fluorescent reporter constructs were used to analyze gene promoter usage, splice variation, and protein localization in transgenic worms. Catalytic activity of recombinant CA proteins was assessed using Hansson's histochemistry. CA's ability to regulate pH as a function of CO2 and HCO3 was measured using dynamic fluorescent imaging of genetically-targeted biosensors.
Results
Each of the six CA genes was found to be expressed in a distinct repertoire of cell types. Surprisingly, worms also expressed a catalytically-active CA splice variant, cah-4a, in which an alternative first exon targeted the protein to the nucleus. Cah-4a expression was restricted mainly to the nervous system, where it was found in nearly all neurons, and recombinant CAH-4A protein could regulate pH in the nucleus.
Conclusions
In addition to establishing C. elegans as a platform for studying αCA function, this is the first example of a nuclear-targeted αCA in any organism to date.
General significance
A classical αCA isoform is targeted exclusively to the nucleus where its activity may impact nuclear physiologic and pathophysiologic responses.

Abstract: Members of the intracellular phospholipase A1 family of proteins have been implicated in organelle biogenesis and membrane trafficking. The mammalian family comprises three members: phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1)/DDHD1, p125/Sec23ip and KIAA0725p/DDHD2, all of which have a DDHD domain. PA-PLA1 is mostly cytosolic, while KIAA0725p and p125 are more stably associated with the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and ER exit sites, respectively. Here we show that KIAA0725p and p125 are novel phosphoinositide-binding proteins. Deletion and mutational analyses of KIAA0725p suggested that a sterile alpha-motif (SAM), which is also present in p125, but not in cytosolic PA-PLA1, and the following DDHD domain comprise a minimal region for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P)-binding. A construct with mutations in the positively charged cluster of the SAM domain is defective in both phosphoinositide-binding and Golgi/ERGIC targeting. Consistent with the view that the PI(4)P-binding is important for the membrane association of KIAA0725p, expression of phosphoinositide phosphatase Sac1 reduces the association of expressed KIAA0725p with membranes. In addition, we show that deletion of the DDHD domain or introduction of point mutations at the conserved aspartate or histidine residues in the domain abolishes the phospholipase activity of KIAA0725p and PA-PLA1. Together, our results suggest that KIAA0725p is targeted to specific organelle membranes in a phosphoinositide-dependent manner, and that its SAM and DDHD domains are essential for its phosphoinositide-binding and phospholipase activity.

Novel involvement of leukotriene B4 receptor 2 through ERK activation by PP2A down-regulation in leukotriene B4-induced keratin phosphorylation and reorganization of pancreatic cancer cells,

Abstract: Perinuclear reorganization via phosphorylation of specific serine residues in keratin is involved in the deformability of metastatic cancer cells. The level of leukotriene B4 is high in pancreatic cancers. However, the roles of LTB4 and its cognate receptors in keratin reorganization of pancreatic cancers are not known. LTB4 dose-dependently induced phosphorylation and reorganization of Keratin 8 (K8) and these processes were reversed by LY255283 (BLT2 antagonist). BLT2 agonists such as Comp A and 15(S)-HETE also induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8. Moreover, Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization were blocked by LY255283. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization in PANC-1 cells. Over-expression of BLT2 promoted K8 phosphorylation. Comp A promoted the migration of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and LY255283 blocked Comp A-induced migration, respectively. PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) suppressed Comp A-induced phosphorylation of serine 431 and reorganization of K8. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed the expression of pERK, and over-expression of BLT2 increased the expression of pERK even without Comp A. Comp A induced the expression of active ERK (pERK) and BLT2. These inductions were blocked by PD98059. Comp A decreased PP2A expression and hindered the binding of PP2A to the K8, leading to the activation of ERK. PD98059 suppressed the Comp A-induced migration of PANC-1 cells and BLT2 over-expression-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that BLT2 is involved in LTB4‐induced phosphorylation and reorganization through ERK activation by PP2A downregulation, leading to increased migration of PANC‐1 cells.

1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 mechanism of action: Modulation of L-type calcium channels leading to calcium uptake and intermediate filament phosphorylation in cerebral cortex of young rats,

Abstract: The involvement of calcium-mediated signaling pathways in the mechanism of action of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) is currently demonstrated. In this study we found that 1,25D induces nongenomic effects mediated by membrane vitamin D receptor (VDRm) by modulating intermediate filament (IF) phosphorylation and calcium uptake through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC) in cerebral cortex of 10day-old rats. Results showed that the mechanism of action of 1,25D involves intra- and extracellular calcium levels, as well as the modulation of chloride and potassium channels. The effects of L-VDCCs on membrane voltage occur over a broad potential range and could involve depolarizing or hyperpolarizing coupling modes, supporting a cross-talk among Ca2+ uptake and potassium and chloride channels. Also, the Na+/K+-ATPase inactivation by ouabain mimicked the 1,25D action on 45Ca2+ uptake. The Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition observed herein might lead to intracellular Na+ accumulation with subsequent L-VDCC opening and consequently increased 45Ca2+ (calcium, isotope of mass 45) uptake. Moreover, the 1,25D effect is dependent on the activation of the following protein kinases: cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (PKCaMII), phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K) and mitogen‐activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK). The modulation of calcium entry into neural cells by the 1,25D we are highlighting, might take a role in the regulation of a plethora of intracellular processes. Considering that vitamin D deficiency can lead to brain illness, 1,25D may be a possible candidate to be used, at least as an adjuvant, in the pharmacological therapy of neuropathological conditions.

Abstract: The present study evaluated the role of interleukin (IL) 17 in multilineage commitment of C2C12 myoblastic cells and investigated associated signaling pathways. The results concerning the effects on cell function showed that IL-17 inhibits the migration of C2C12 cells, while not affecting their proliferation. The data regarding the influence on differentiation demonstrated that IL-17 inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells by down-regulating the myogenin mRNA level, myosin heavy chain expression and myotube formation, but promotes their osteogenic differentiation by up-regulating the Runt-related transcription factor 2 mRNA level, cyclooxygenase-2 expression and alkaline phosphatase activity. IL-17 exerted these effects by activating ERK1,2 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which in turn regulated the expression of relevant genes and proteins to inhibit myogenic differentiation and induce osteogenic differentiation. Additional analysis showed that the induction of osteogenic differentiation by IL-17 is independent of BMP signaling. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of IL-17 not only to inhibit the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts but also to convert their differentiation pathway into that of osteoblast lineage providing new insight into the capacities of IL-17 to modulate the differentiation commitment.

Abstract: Acidification of the lumen of intracellular organelles is important for post-transcriptional processing, endosomal maturation, receptor recycling, and vesicle trafficking, being regulated by an intricate balance between H+ influx through vacuolar-type H+-ATPase and efflux through ion channels and transporters, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). The eukaryotic NHE family comprises two major subgroups, one residing in the plasma membrane and the other in intracellular organelles. While mammalian intracellular NHE isoforms are localized to various organelles, including the mid-trans-Golgi compartments, early and late endosomes, and recycling endosomes, Nhx1p, the sole NHE in yeast, has been reported to be localized predominantly to the late endosomal/prevacuolar compartment. Here, using live cell imaging, we demonstrated that Nhx1p is localized to the trans-Golgi network compartments, late endosomes, and recycling endosomes, similar to mammalian intracellular NHE isoforms. Loss of Nhx1p led to accumulation of components of the retromer and endosomal sorting complex required for transport complexes, but not trans-Golgi compartments, in aberrant prevacuolar compartments. Importantly, Nhx1p was also required for recycling of the plasma membrane vesicle SNAP receptor Snc1p. These observations suggest that Nhx1p plays an important role in regulation of the luminal pH of various intracellular organelles, and that this regulation is critical for the protein recycling pathway as well as the endocytic pathway.

Abstract: FRA1 belongs, together with c-Fos and FosB, to the family of Fos proteins that form with members of the ATF and Jun family the transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein 1). Previously we showed that c-Fos protects mouse embryonic fibroblasts against the cytotoxic effects of ultraviolet (UV) light by induction of the endonuclease XPF, leading to enhanced nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. Here, we analyzed the regulation of FRA1 in glioma cells treated with the anticancer drug nimustine (ACNU) and its role in ACNU-induced toxicity. We show that FRA1 is upregulated in glioblastoma cells following ACNU on mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of FRA1 by either siRNA or shRNA clearly sensitized glioma cells towards ACNU-induced cell death. Despite decreased AP-1 binding activity upon FRA1 knockdown, this effect is independent on regulation of the AP-1 target genes fasL, ercc1 and xpf. In addition, FRA1 knockdown does not affect DNA repair capacity. However, lack of FRA1 attenuated the ACNU-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 and led to a reduced arrest of cells in G2/M and, thereby, presumably leads to enhanced cell death in the subsequent cell cycle.

Abstract: Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) via adenosine receptors is known to be involved in the cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Specifically, activation of PKCε is critical for cardioprotection. There is ample evidence that PKCε resides in cardiac mitochondria. However, the signals that promote translocation of PKCε are largely unknown. The present study was designed to determine whether and how adenosine receptor activation induces translocation of PKCε to mitochondria. Freshly isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes and rat heart-derived H9c2 were used in the study. Immunofluorescence imaging of isolated mitochondria showed that PKCε but not PKCδ was localized in mitochondria and this mitochondrial localization of PKCε was significantly increased by adenosine treatment. The adenosine-induced increase in PKCε-positive mitochondria was largely prevented not only by PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, but also by the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin and by siRNA targeting HSP90. Immunoblot analysis from percoll-purified mitochondria further demonstrated that adenosine mediated a significant increase in mitochondrial PKCε but not PKCδ. This effect was blocked by inhibiting PKC activity with chelerythrine and bisindolylmaleimide. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation data showed that PKCε but not PKCδ was associated with TOM70 and HSP90, and this association was enhanced by adenosine treatment. Moreover, adenosine-induced association of PKCε with TOM70 was reduced by suppressing HSP90 expression with siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that adenosine induces HSP90-dependent translocation of PKCε to mitochondria, possibly through mitochondrial import machinery TOM70. These results point out a novel mechanism in regulating PKC in mitochondria and suggest an important implication in ischemic preconditioning or postconditioning.

Abstract: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a central role in development and cancer. The p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) involves in a wide range of cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell proliferation, gene transcription and oncogenic transformation. However, the cross talk between the Wnt and PAK4 signaling pathways is poorly understood. Here, we show that PAK4 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, containing three nuclear export signals (NESs) and two nuclear localization signals (NLSs). PAK4 is exported by the chromosome region maintenance-1 (CRM-1)-dependent pathway and is imported into the nucleus in an importin α5-dependent manner. PAK4 interacts with and phosphorylates β-catenin on Ser675, which promotes the TCF/LEF transcriptional activity and stabilizes β-catenin through inhibition of its degradation. Moreover, nuclear import of PAK4 accompanies with the nuclear import of β-catenin and increased TCF/LEF transcriptional activity. We further demonstrated that PAK4 associates with the TCF/LEF transcriptional complex by ChIP assays. These findings uncover a novel role for PAK4 in modulating intracellular translocation and signaling of β-catenin.

Abstract: Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small protein highly conserved among eukaryotes and involved in practically all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Polymeric chains assembled from covalently-linked Ub monomers function as molecular signals in the regulation of a host of cellular processes. Our previous studies have shown that the predominant state of Lys48-linked di- and tetra-Ub chains at near-physiological conditions is a closed conformation, in which the Ub–Ub interface is formed by the hydrophobic surface residues of the adjacent Ub units. Because these very residues are involved in (poly)Ub interactions with the majority of Ub-binding proteins, their sequestration at the Ub–Ub interface renders the closed conformation of polyUb binding incompetent. Thus the existence of open conformation(s) and the interdomain motions opening and closing the Ub–Ub interface is critical for the recognition of Lys48-linked polyUb by its receptors. Knowledge of the conformational properties of a polyUb signal is essential for our understanding of its specific recognition by various Ub-receptors. Despite their functional importance, open states of Lys48-linked chains are poorly characterized. Here we report a crystal structure of the open state of Lys48-linked di-Ub. Moreover, using NMR, we examined interactions of the open state of this chain (at pH4.5) with a Lys48-linkage-selective receptor, the UBA2 domain of a shuttle protein hHR23a. Our results show that di-Ub binds UBA2 in the same mode and with comparable affinity as the closed state. Our data suggest a mechanism for polyUb signal recognition, whereby Ub-binding proteins select specific conformations out of the available ensemble of polyUb chain conformations. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin Drug Discovery and Diagnostics.

Abstract: Cerebral amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is pathogenically associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). BACE-1 is involved in Aβ generation while insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) partakes in Aβ proteolytic clearance. Vulnerable regions in AD brains show increased BACE-1 protein levels and enzymatic activity while the opposite occurs with IDE. Another common feature in SAD brains is Notch1 overexpression. Here we demonstrate an increase in mRNA levels of Hey-1, a Notch target gene, and a decrease of IDE transcripts in the hippocampus of SAD brains as compared to controls. Transient transfection of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in N2aSW cells, mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a) stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation, reduce IDE mRNA levels, promoting extracellular Aβ accumulation. Also, NICD, HES-1 and Hey-1 overexpression result in decreased IDE proximal promoter activity. This effect was mediated by 2 functional sites located at −379/−372 and −310−303 from the first translation start site in the −575/−19 (556bp) fragment of IDE proximal promoter. By site-directed mutagenesis of the IDE promoter region we reverted the inhibitory effect mediated by NICD transfection suggesting that these sites are indeed responsible for the Notch-mediated inhibition of the IDE gene expression. Intracranial injection of the Notch ligand JAG-1 in Tg2576 mice, expressing the Swedish mutation in human APP, induced overexpression of HES-1 and Hey-1 and reduction of IDE mRNA levels, respectively. Our results support our theory that a Notch-dependent IDE transcriptional modulation may impact on Aβ metabolism providing a functional link between Notch signaling and the amyloidogenic pathway in SAD.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and may contribute to the development and progression of many infective diseases including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. The Tat protein is fundamental to viral gene expression. In this study, our goal was to investigate the regulation of a specific miRNA (known as miR-217) in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator (MAGI) cells and explore the mechanisms by which miR-217 influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through down-regulation of SIRT1 expression. We showed that miR-217 was up-regulated when Tat was expressed in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator cells. Forced expression of “miR-217 mimics” increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. In addition, miR-217 significantly inhibited SIRT1 protein expression by acting on the 3′-UTR of the SIRT1 mRNA. In turn, the decrease in SIRT1 protein abundance provoked by miR-217 affected two important types of downstream signaling molecules that were regulated by Tat. Lower expression of SIRT1 caused by miR-217 enhanced Tat-induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65-NFkB and also exacerbated the loss of AMPK phosphorylation triggered by Tat. Our results uncover previously unknown links between Tat and a specific host cell miRNA that targets SIRT1. We also demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism impinges on p65-NFkB and AMPK signaling: two important host cell pathways that influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. Our results also suggest that strategies to augment SIRT1 protein expression by down-regulation of miR-217 may have therapeutic benefits to prevent HIV-1 replication.

Abstract: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a hypophysiotropic neurohormone, participates in the regulation of pleiotropic functions. The recent discovery of intracellular PACAP receptors in the brain and the testis as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of PACAP, i.e. extended α-helix containing basic residues, prompted us to evaluate the propensity of PACAP to cross the plasma membrane in a receptor-independent manner. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrated the ability of FITC-conjugated PACAP to efficiently penetrate into the internal cell compartment by direct translocation and endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and macropinocytosis. Our study also revealed that, once inside the cells, PACAP38 is not entirely degraded by intracellular enzymes and that a significant amount of intact PACAP38 is also able to exit cells. Moreover, using binding assay on rat nuclear fractions from various tissues, PACAP nuclear receptors were identified. We also found that PACAP stimulates calcium release in rat testis nuclei. Interestingly, PACAP27 and PACAP38 but not VIP were able to upregulate de novo DNA synthesis in testis nuclei and that this effect was abolished by PACAP(6–38). These results support the presence of PAC1 receptors at the nuclear membrane and raise questions about their role in the biological activity of the peptide. These findings contribute to the characterization of PACAP as an intracrine factor and suggest that these intracellular PAC1 binding sites, probably associated with specific biological activities, should be taken into account during the development of PACAP-based drugs.

Abstract: The small GTPase Arl6 is implicated in the ciliopathic human genetic disorder Bardet–Biedl syndrome, acting at primary cilia in recruitment of the octomeric BBSome complex, which is required for specific trafficking events to and from the cilium in eukaryotes. Here we describe functional characterisation of Arl6 in the flagellated model eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei, which requires motility for viability. Unlike human Arl6 which has a ciliary localisation, TbARL6 is associated with electron-dense vesicles throughout the cell body following co-translational modification by N-myristoylation. Similar to the related protein ARL-3A in T. brucei, modulation of expression of ARL6 by RNA interference does not prevent motility but causes a significant reduction in flagellum length. Tubulin is identified as an ARL6 interacting partner, suggesting that ARL6 may act as an anchor between vesicles and cytoplasmic microtubules. We provide evidence that the interaction between ARL6 and the BBSome is conserved in unicellular eukaryotes. Overexpression of BBS1 leads to translocation of endogenous ARL6 to the site of exogenous BBS1 at the flagellar pocket. Furthermore, a combination of BBS1 overexpression and ARL6 RNAi has a synergistic inhibitory effect on cell growth. Our findings indicate that ARL6 in trypanosomes contributes to flagellum biogenesis, most likely through an interaction with the BBSome.

Abstract: Ferredoxins are iron–sulfur proteins that have been studied for decades because of their role in facilitating the monooxygenase reactions catalyzed by p450 enzymes. More recently, studies in bacteria and yeast have demonstrated important roles for ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase in iron–sulfur cluster assembly. The human genome contains two homologous ferredoxins, ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and ferredoxin 2 (FDX2 — formerly known as ferredoxin 1L). More recently, the roles of these two human ferredoxins in iron–sulfur cluster assembly were assessed, and it was concluded that FDX1 was important solely for its interaction with p450 enzymes to synthesize mitochondrial steroid precursors, whereas FDX2 was used for synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, but not steroidogenesis. To further assess the role of the FDX–FDXR system in mammalian iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, we performed siRNA studies on FDX1 and FDX2, on several human cell lines, using oligonucleotides identical to those previously used, along with new oligonucleotides that specifically targeted each gene. We concluded that both FDX1 and FDX2 were important in iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis. Loss of FDX1 activity disrupted activity of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes and cellular iron homeostasis, causing mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron depletion. Moreover, knockdown of the sole human ferredoxin reductase, FDXR, diminished iron–sulfur cluster assembly and caused mitochondrial iron overload in conjunction with cytosolic depletion. Our studies suggest that interference with any of the three related genes, FDX1, FDX2 or FDXR, disrupts iron–sulfur cluster assembly and maintenance of normal cytosolic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Abstract: Cholinergic signaling suppresses inflammation in blood and brain and attenuates apoptosis in other tissues, but whether it blocks inflammation in skeletal muscle under toxicant exposure, injuries and diseases remained unexplored. Here, we report nicotinic attenuation of inflammation and alteration of apoptotic protein expression pattern in murine muscle tissue and cultured myotubes, involving the RNA-binding protein, Tristetraprolin, and the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1. In muscles and C2C12 myotubes, cholinergic excitation by exposure to nicotine or the organophosphorous pesticide, Paraoxon, induced Tristetraprolin overproduction while reducing pro-inflammatory transcripts such as IL-6, CXCL1 (KC) and CCL2 (MCP-1). Furthermore, nicotinic excitation under exposure to the bacterial endotoxin LPS attenuated over-expression of the CCL2 and suppressed the transcriptional activity of NF-ĸB and AP-1. Tristetraprolin was essential for this anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine in basal conditions. However, its knockdown also impaired the pro-inflammatory response to LPS. Finally, in vivo administration of Paraoxon or recombinant Acetylcholinesterase, leading respectively to either gain or loss of cholinergic signaling, modified muscle expression of key mRNA processing factors and several of their apoptosis-related targets. Specifically, cholinergic imbalances enhanced the kinase activators of the Serine–Arginine splicing kinases, Clk1 and Clk3. Moreover, Paraoxon raised the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, through a previously unrecognized polyadenylation site selection mechanism, producing longer, less stable Mcl-1 mRNA transcripts. Together, our findings demonstrate that in addition to activating muscle function, acetylcholine regulates muscle inflammation and cell survival, and point to Tristetraprolin and the choice of Mcl-1 mRNA polyadenylation sites as potential key players in muscle reactions to insults.

Abstract: The responses of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to isoproterenol have been examined in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, AMPK represents the link between cell growth and energy availability whereas ODC, the key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is essential for all growth processes and it is thought to have a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Isoproterenol rapidly induced ODC activity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts by promoting the synthesis of the enzyme protein and this effect was counteracted by inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The increase in enzyme activity became significant between 15 and 30min after the treatment. At the same time, isoproterenol stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPKα catalytic subunits (Thr172), that was associated to an increase in acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (Ser72) phosphorylation. Downregulation of both α1 and α2 isoforms of the AMPK catalytic subunit by siRNA to knockdown AMPK enzymatic activity, led to superinduction of ODC in isoproterenol-treated cardiomyoblasts. Downregulation of AMPKα increased ODC activity even in cells treated with other adrenergic agonists and in control cells. Analogue results were obtained in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected with a shRNA construct against AMPKα. In conclusion, isoproterenol quickly activates in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts two events that seem to contrast one another. The first one, an increase in ODC activity, is linked to cell growth, whereas the second, AMPK activation, is a homeostatic mechanism that negatively modulates the first. The modulation of ODC activity by AMPK represents a mechanism that may contribute to control cell growth processes.

Abstract: As the importance of ubiquitylation in certain disease states becomes increasingly apparent, the enzymes responsible for removal of ubiquitin (Ub) from target proteins, deubiquitylases (DUBs), are becoming attractive targets for drug discovery. For rapid identification of compounds that alter DUB function, in vitro assays must be able to provide statistically robust data over a wide dynamic range of both substrate and enzyme concentrations during high throughput screening (HTS). The most established reagents for HTS are Ubs with a quenched fluorophore conjugated to the C-terminus; however, a luciferase-based strategy for detecting DUB activity (DUB-Glo™, Promega) provides a wider dynamic range than traditional fluorogenic reagents. Unfortunately, this assay requires high enzyme concentrations and lacks specificity for DUBs over other isopeptidases (e.g. desumoylases), as it is based on an aminoluciferin (AML) derivative of a peptide derived from the C-terminus of Ub (Z-RLRGG-). Conjugation of aminoluciferin to a full-length Ub (Ub-AML) yields a substrate that has a wide dynamic range, yet displays detection limits for DUBs 100- to 1000-fold lower than observed with DUB-Glo™. Ub-AML was even a sensitive substrate for DUBs (e.g. JosD1 and USP14) that do not show appreciable activity with DUB-Glo™. Aminoluciferin derivatives of hSUMO2 and NEDD8 were also shown to be sensitive substrates for desumoylases and deneddylases, respectively. Ub/Ubl-AML substrates are amenable to HTS (Z’=0.67) yielding robust signal, and providing an alternative drug discovery platform for Ub/Ubl isopeptidases.

Abstract: Human ether á-go-go gene potassium channels (hEAG1 or Kv10.1) are expressed in brain and various human cancers and play a role in neuronal excitement and tumor progression. However, the functional regulation of hEAG channels by signal transduction is not fully understood. The present study was therefore designed to investigate whether hEAG1 channels are regulated by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in HEK 293 cells stably expressing hEAG1 gene using whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and mutagenesis approaches. We found that the selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor AG556 (10μM), but not the platelet growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase inhibitor AG1295 (10μM) or the Src-family inhibitor PP2 (10μM), can inhibit hEAG1 current, and the inhibitory effect can be reversed by the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor orthovanadate. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation level of hEAG1 channels was reduced by AG556, and the reduction was significantly countered by orthovanadate. The hEAG1 mutants Y90A, Y344A and Y485A, but not Y376A and Y479A, exhibited reduced response to AG556. Interestingly, the inhibition effect of AG556 was lost in triple mutant hEAG1 channels at Y90, Y344, and Y485 with alanine. These results demonstrate for the first time that hEAG1 channel activity is regulated by EGFR kinase at the tyrosine residues Tyr90, Try344, and Try485. This effect is likely involved in regulating neuronal activity and/or tumor growth.

Abstract: Hsp90 forms a variety of complexes differing both in clientele and co-chaperones. Central to the role of co-chaperones in the formation of Hsp90 complexes is the delivery of client proteins and the regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. Determining the mechanisms by which co-chaperones regulate Hsp90 is essential in understanding the assembly of these complexes and the activation and maturation of Hsp90's clientele. Mechanistically, co-chaperones alter the kinetics of the ATP-coupled conformational changes of Hsp90. The structural changes leading to the formation of a catalytically active unit involve all regions of the Hsp90 dimer. Their complexity has allowed different orthologues of Hsp90 to evolve kinetically in slightly different ways. The interaction of the cytosolic Hsp90 with a variety of co-chaperones lends itself to a complex set of different regulatory mechanisms that modulate Hsp90's conformation and ATPase activity. It also appears that the conformational switches of Hsp90 are not necessarily coupled under all circumstances. Here, I described different co-chaperone complexes and then discuss in detail the mechanisms and role that specific co-chaperones play in this. I will also discuss emerging evidence that post-translational modifications also affect the ATPase activity of Hsp90, and thus complex formation. Finally, I will present evidence showing how Hsp90's active site, although being highly conserved, can be altered to show resistance to drug binding, but still maintain ATP binding and ATPase activity. Such changes are therefore unlikely to significantly alter Hsp90's interactions with client proteins and co-chaperones.

Abstract: Neutrophils provide the first line of defense against microbial invasion in part through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is mediated through activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase generating superoxide anion (O2−). The phagocyte oxidase (phox) has multiple protein components that assemble on the plasma membrane in stimulated neutrophils. We recently described a protein in neutrophils, peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), which has both peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities and enhances oxidase activity in an SDS-activated, cell-free system. The function of Prdx6 in phox activity is further investigated. In reconstituted phox-competent K562 cells, siRNA-mediated suppression of Prdx6 resulted in decreased NADPH oxidase activity in response to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In neutrophils stimulated with PMA, Prdx6 translocated to plasma membrane as demonstrated by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Translocation of Prdx6 in phox competent K562 cells required both p67phox and p47phox. In addition, plasma membrane from PMA-stimulated, oxidase competent K562 cells with siRNA-mediated Prdx6 suppression contained less p47phox and p67phox compared to cells in which Prdx6 was not decreased. Cell-free oxidase assays showed that recombinant Prdx6 did not alter the Km for NADPH, but increased the Vmax for O2− production in a saturable, Prdx6 concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant proteins with mutations in Prdx (C47S) and phospholipase (S32A) activity both enhanced cell-free phox activity to the same extent as wild type protein. Prdx6 supports retention of the active oxidase complex in stimulated plasma membrane, and results with mutant proteins imply that Prdx6 serves an additional biochemical or structural role in supporting optimal NADPH oxidase activity.

Abstract: In this study, we describe a new post-translational modification at position −1 of the PDZ-binding motif in the mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC) protein and its role in lamellipodia formation. Serine 828 at position −1 of this motif is phosphorylated, which is predicted to increase MCC binding affinity with the polarity protein Scrib. We show that endogenous MCC localizes at the active migratory edge of cells, where it interacts with Scrib and the non-muscle motor protein Myosin-IIB. Expression of MCC harboring a phosphomimetic mutation MCC-S828D strongly impaired lamellipodia formation and resulted in accumulation of Myosin-IIB in the membrane cortex fraction. We propose that MCC regulates lamellipodia formation by binding to Scrib and its downstream partner Myosin-IIB in a multiprotein complex. Importantly, we propose that the function of this complex is under the regulation of a newly described phosphorylation of the PDZ-binding motif at position −1.

Abstract: Introduction
During aging, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in articular cartilage. In this study we determined whether AGEs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and studied the ER stress-activated pathways that stimulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in human chondrocytes.
Methods
Chondrocytes were stimulated with AGE-BSA. Gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR and protein expression was studied by immunoblotting. Studies to elucidate involved pathways were executed using siRNAs and specific inhibitors of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), MAPKs and NF-κB.
Results
AGE-BSA induced expression of GRP78 with concomitant increase in COX-2 expression was observed in human chondrocytes. In addition, expression of Bag-1, an ER stress marker was also increased by AGE-BSA. RAGE knockdown inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP78 and COX-2. Treatment with eIF2α inhibitor or eIF2α knockdown inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP78 and COX-2 with decreased PGE2 production. Treatment with SB202190 inhibited AGE-BSA-induced expression of GRP78 and COX-2, while treatment with PD98051 inhibited AGE-BSA-induced GRP78 protein expression but had no effect on COX-2 protein expression. SP600125 had no effect on either GRP78 or COX-2 protein expression. Bay 11-7082 suppressed AGE-BSA-induced GRP78 and COX-2 expression. AGE-BSA-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited by treatment with SB202190 and by eIF2α knockdown, but was not inhibited when chondrocytes were treated with SP600125 or PD98059.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that AGEs induce ER stress and stimulate the expression of COX-2 through eIF2α, p38-MAPK and NF-κB pathways in human chondrocytes. Our results provide important insights into cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis associated with latent ER stress.

Role of lbx2 in the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway for convergence and extension movements and hypaxial myogenesis in zebrafish,

Abstract: It has been suggested that mouse lbx1 is essential for directing hypaxial myogenic precursor cell migration. In zebrafish, the expression of lbx1a, lbx1b, and lbx2 has been observed in pectoral fin buds. It has also been shown that knocking down endogenous lbx2 in zebrafish embryos diminishes myoD expression in the pectoral fin bud. However, downstream lbxs signals remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a previously unknown function of zebrafish lbx2 (lbx2) during convergent extension (CE) movements. The abrogation of the lbx2 function by two non-overlapping morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) resulted in the defective convergence and extension movements in morphants during gastrulation. Our transplantation studies further demonstrated that the overexpression of lbx2 autonomously promotes CE movements. Expression of wnt5b is significantly reduced in lbx2 morphants. We have demonstrated that application of the wnt5b MO, a dominant-negative form of disheveled (Dvl) and a chemical inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase Y27632 in zebrafish embryos have effects reminiscent that are of the CE and hypaxial myogenesis defects observed in lbx2 morphants. Moreover, the CE and hypaxial mesoderm defects seen in lbx2 morphants can be rescued by co-injection with wnt5b or RhoA mRNA. However, this reduced level of active RhoA and hypaxial myogenesis defects in the embryos injected with the dominant-negative form of Dvl mRNA cannot be effectively restored by co-injection with lbx2 mRNA. Our results suggest that the key noncanonical Wnt signaling components Wnt5, Dvl, and RhoA are downstream effectors involved in the regulative roles of lbx2 in CE movement and hypaxial myogenesis during zebrafish embryogenesis.

Critical role of cyclin B1/Cdc2 up-regulation in the induction of mitotic prometaphase arrest in human breast cancer cells treated with 2-methoxyestradiol,

Abstract: Earlier studies showed that 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an endogenous nonpolar metabolite of estradiol-17β, is a strong inducer of G2/M cell cycle arrest (based on analysis of cellular DNA content) in human cancer cell lines. The present study sought to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying 2ME2-induced cell cycle arrest. We found that 2ME2 can selectively induce mitotic prometaphase arrest, but not G2 phase arrest, in cultured MDA-MB-435s and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. During the induction of prometaphase arrest, there is a time-dependent initial up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 proteins, occurring around 12–24h. The strong initial up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 matches in timing the 2ME2-induced prometaphase arrest. The 2ME2-induced prometaphase arrest is abrogated by selective knockdown of cyclin B1 and Cdc2, or by pre-treatment of cells with roscovitine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, or by co-treatment of cells with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor that was found to suppress the early up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2. In addition, we provided evidence showing that MAD2 and JNK1 are important upstream mediators of 2ME2-induced up-regulation of cyclin B1 and Cdc2 as well as the subsequent induction of mitotic prometaphase arrest.

Abstract: Through binding to parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH1R interacts with kidney-specific scaffold proteins, including the sodium hydrogen exchanger regulatory factors 1 and 2 (NHERFs), and ezrin. To facilitate in vivo localization, tetramethylrhodamine-labeled PTH (PTH-TMR) was used as a fluorescent probe. In mice, PTH-TMR localizes to luminal surfaces of tubular S1 segments that overlap PTH1R immunostaining, but does not directly overlap with megalin-specific antibodies. PTH-TMR staining directly overlaps with Npt2a in nascent, endocytic vesicles, marking the location of transporter regulation. PKA substrate antibodies display marked staining increases in segments labeled with PTH-TMR, demonstrating a functional effect. In the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, PTH-TMR staining is markedly reduced and shifts to co-localizing with megalin. At 15min post-injection, PTH-TMR-labeled vesicles do not co-localize with either NHERF or ezrin, suggesting PTH1R dissociation from the scaffold complex. At the 5min time point, PTH-TMR stains the base of microvilli where it localizes with both NHERF2 and ezrin, and only partially with NHERF1. Strikingly, the bulk of ezrin protein becomes undetectable with the polyclonal, CS3145 antibody, revealing a PTH-induced conformational change in the scaffold. A second ezrin antibody (3C12) is capable of detecting the altered ezrin protein. The CS3145 antibody only binds to the active form of ezrin and fails to recognize the inactive form, while the 3C12 reagent can detect either active or inactive ezrin. Here we show that the PTH1R is part of the ezrin scaffold complex and that acute actions of PTH suggest a rapid inactivation of ezrin in a spatially defined manner.

Abstract: The SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase, SHIP1, negatively regulates signal transduction from the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The mode of coupling between SHIP1 and the BCR has not been elucidated so far. In comparison to wild-type cells, B cells expressing a mutant IgD- or IgM-BCR containing a C-terminally truncated Ig-α respond to pervanadate stimulation with markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP1 and augmented activation of protein kinase B. This indicates that SHIP1 is capable of interacting with the C-terminus of Ig-α. Employing a system of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in S2 cells, we can clearly demonstrate interaction between the SH2-domain of SHIP1 and Ig-α. Furthermore, a fluorescently labeled SH2-domain of SHIP1 translocates to the plasma membrane in an Ig-α-dependent manner. Interestingly, whereas the SHIP1 SH2-domain can be pulled-down with phospho-peptides corresponding to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of Ig-α from detergent lysates, no interaction between full-length SHIP1 and the phosphorylated Ig-α ITAM can be observed. Further studies show that the SH2-domain of SHIP1 can bind to the C-terminus of the SHIP1 molecule, most probably by inter- as well as intra-molecular means, and that this interaction regulates the association between different forms of SHIP1 and Ig-α.

Abstract: The ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) is an organelle through which cargo proteins pass and are being transferred by either anterograde or retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. We examined the effect of 80 different kinase inhibitors on ERGIC morphology and found that rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, induced the dispersion of the perinuclear ERGIC into punctate structures. Rottlerin also delayed anterograde transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) from the ER to the Golgi and retrograde transport of cholera toxin from cell surface to the ER via the Golgi. RNA interference revealed that knockdown of PKCδ or ε resulted in the dispersion of the ERGIC, but unexpectedly did not inhibit VSVG and cholera toxin transport. We also found that rottlerin depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, as does carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupler, and demonstrated that a decrease in the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels by rottlerin might underlie the block in transports. These results suggest that PKCδ and ε specifically regulate the morphology of the ERGIC and that the maintenance of ERGIC structure is not necessarily required for anterograde and retrograde transports.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that insulin-like-growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays a role in the regulation of basolateral Cl channels in the thick ascending limb (TAL). The patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that application of IGF-I or insulin inhibited the basolateral 10-pS Cl channels. However, the concentration of insulin required for the inhibition of the Cl channels by 50% (K1/2) was ten times higher than those of IGF-1. The inhibitory effect of IGF-I on the 10-pS Cl channels was blocked by suppressing protein tyrosine kinase or by blocking phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) failed to abolish the inhibitory effect of IGF-1 on the Cl channels in the TAL. Western blot analysis demonstrated that IGF-1 significantly increased the phosphorylation of phospholipid-dependent kinase (PDK) at serine residue 241 (Ser241) and AKT at Ser473 in the isolated medullary TAL. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 abolished the effect of IGF-1 on the phosphorylation of PDK and AKT. The notion that the effect of IGF-1 on the 10-pS Cl channels was induced by stimulation of PDK–AKT–mTOR pathway was further suggested by the finding that rapamycin completely abolished the effect of IGF-1 on the 10-pS Cl channels in the TAL. We conclude that IGF-1 inhibits the basolateral Cl channels by activating PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways. The inhibitory effect of IGF-1 on the Cl channels may play a role in ameliorating the ischemia-induced renal injury through IGF-1 administration.

Abstract: The activator of Hsp90 ATPase, Aha1, is an Hsp90 co-chaperone that has been suggested to act as a general stimulator of Hsp90 function. In this report, we have characterized the interaction of Aha1 with Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and in HeLa cell extracts. Complexes formed by Aha1 with Hsp90 in RRL were stabilized by molybdate and contained the co-chaperones FKBP52 and p23/Sba1, but lacked HOP/Sti1 and Cdc37. Aha1 complexes isolated from HeLa cell extracts also contained Hsp70 and DNAJA1. Over-expression of Aha1 has been reported to stimulate the activity of v-Src and steroid hormone receptors ectopically expressed in yeast, however, no interaction between Aha1 and nascent v-Src or the progesterone receptor could be detected in RRL. Contrary to expectations, over-expression of Aha1 also inhibited the rate of Hsp90-dependent refolding of denatured luciferase. A number of potential client proteins that specifically associated with Aha1 were identified by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and verified by Western blotting. The proteins identified suggest that Aha1 may play roles in modulating RNA splicing and DNA repair, in addition to other cellular processes.

Abstract: The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib remains the only ubiquitin pathway effector to become a drug (VELCADE®) and has become a successful treatment for hematological malignancies. While producing a global cellular effect, proteasome inhibitors have not triggered the catastrophe articulated initially in terms such as “buildup of cellular garbage”. Proteasome inhibitors, in fact, do have a therapeutic window, although in the case of the prototype bortezomib it is small owing to peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression and, as recently reported, cardiotoxicity [1]. Currently, several second-generation molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation to increase this window. An alternative strategy is to target ubiquitin pathway enzymes acting at non-proteasomal sites—E1, E2, and E3, associated with ubiquitin conjugation, and deubiquitylating enzymes (“DUBs”)—that act locally on selected targets rather than on the whole cell. Inhibitors (or activators, in some cases) of these enzymes should be developable as selective antitumor agents with toxicity profiles superior to that of bortezomib. Various therapeutic hypotheses follow from known cellular mechanisms of these target enzymes; most hypotheses relate to cancer, reminiscent of the FDA-approved protein kinase inhibitors now marketed. Since ubiquitin tagging controls the cellular content, activity, or compartmentation of proteins associated with disease, inhibitors or activators of ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation are predicted to have an impact on disease. For practical and empirical reasons, inhibitors of ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been the favored therapeutic avenue. In approximately the time that has elapsed since the approval of bortezomib in 2003, there has been some progress in developing potential anticancer drugs that target various ubiquitin pathway enzymes. An E1 inhibitor and inhibitors of E3 are now in clinical trial, with some objective responses reported. Appropriate assays and/or rational design may uncover improved inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as E2 and DUBs, for further development. Presently, it should become clear whether one or both of the two general strategies for ubiquitin-based drug discovery will lead to truly superior new medicines for cancer and other diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin Drug Discovery and Diagnostics.

Abstract: Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionally conserved apoptotic suppressor and belongs to the BI-1 family of proteins, which contain BI-1-like transmembrane domains. As their cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood, we compared their anti-apoptotic properties. Forced expression of BI-1 resulted in the most effective suppression of stress-induced apoptosis, compared with other family members, together with significant extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation. BI-1-mediated ERK1/2 activation led to the suppression of mitochondria-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Involvement of the ERK signaling pathway in BI-1-induced anti-apoptotic effects was confirmed by knockdown studies with ERK- or BI-1-specific siRNA. Moreover, we produced transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing BI-1, and the relationship between ERK1/2 activation and the suppression of ROS production or apoptosis was confirmed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from these mice. Interestingly, we found that BI-1 TG mice showed splenomegaly and abnormal megakaryopoiesis. Taken together, our results suggest that BI-1-induced ERK1/2 activation plays an important role in the modulation of intracellular ROS generation and apoptotic cell death and may also affect autoimmune response.

Activation of Stat3 in endothelial cells following hypoxia–reoxygenation is mediated by Rac1 and protein kinase C,

Abstract: Stat3 is an important transcription factor that regulates both proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways in the heart. This study examined the mechanisms of activation of Stat3 in human endothelial cells following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). By expression of constitutively active Rac1 mutant protein, and by RNA silencing of Rac1, we found that Stat3 Y705 and S727 phosphorylation following H/R is dependent on Rac1. Reactive oxygen species produced during H/R, and direct physical association with Rac1 both contribute to Stat3 activation. Stat3 forms a multiprotein complex with Rac1 and PKC in an H/R-dependent manner, which at least in part, appears to regulate Stat3 S727 phosphorylation. Selective inhibition of PKC with calphostin C produces a marked suppression of Stat3 S727 phosphorylation. The association of Stat3 with Rac1 occurs predominantly at the cell membrane, but also inside the nucleus, and occurs through the binding of the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 to the 54 NH2-terminal residues of Rac1. Transfection with a peptide comprising the NH2-terminal 17 amino acid residues of Rac1 inhibits Stat3 S727 phosphorylation after H/R. Thus, Stat3 is activated in endothelial cells by H/R through Rac1-dependent signaling pathways resulting in physical association between Rac1 and Stat3 and the formation of a novel multiprotein complex with PKC.

Abstract: Estradiol (E2) regulates several cellular functions through the interaction with estrogen receptor subtypes, ERα and ERβ, which present different functional and regulation properties. ER subtypes have been identified in human astrocytomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. We studied the role of ER subtypes in cell growth of two human astrocytoma cell lines derived from tumors of different evolution grades: U373 and D54 (grades III and IV, respectively). E2 significantly increased the number of cells in both lines and the co-administration with an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780) significantly blocked E2 effects. ERα was the predominant subtype in both cell lines. E2 and ICI 182, 780 down-regulated ERα expression. The number of U373 and D54 cells significantly increased after PPT (ERα agonist) treatment but not after DPN (ERβ agonist) one. To determine the role of SRC-1 and SRC-3 coactivators in ERα induced cell growth, we silenced them with RNA interference. Coactivator silencing blocked the increase in cell number induced by PPT. The content of proteins involved in proliferation and metastasis was also determined after PPT treatment. Western blot analysis showed that in U373 cells the content of PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B), EGFR, VEGF and cyclin D1 increased after PPT treatment while in D54 cells only the content of EGFR was increased. Our results demonstrate that E2 induces cell growth of human astrocytoma cell lines through ERα and its interaction with SRC-1 and SRC-3 and also suggest differential roles of ERα on cell growth depending on astrocytoma grade.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central blindness in the elderly population. The wet type of AMD is characterized by extensive growth of new vessels. One of the effective strategies to treat wet AMD is to limit the choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We studied the effects of adiponectin peptide I (APNpI) on new vessel growth in laser-induced rat model of wet AMD and on rat choroidal endothelial cell (CEC) culture. CNV size and vessel density were investigated by microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for von Willebrand Factor (vWF), APN, APN receptors 1 (AdipoR1), 2 (AdipoR2), VEGF, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed in CNV area. The mRNA expression of VEGF and VEGF-R2 in RPE-choroid was investigated by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. APNpI inhibited area of CNV by 4 fold, number of vWF positive vessels by 99% and area of subretinal tissue by 40%. The expression of VEGF and VEGF-R2 at mRNA and protein levels decreased after APNpI treatment in vivo. Proliferative index (PCNA) was 5 folds less in laser spots of APNpI treated rats compared to controls. In conclusion, APNpI inhibited formation of new vessels in rat model of CNV by decreasing VEGF, VEGF-R2 expression and cell proliferation. Thus, APNpI may have potential therapeutic use for AMD treatment since it significantly inhibited CNV.

Abstract: Small ubiquitin-related modifiers 1, 2 and 3 (SUMO-1, -2, -3), members of the ubiquitin-like protein family, can be conjugated to various cellular proteins. Conjugates of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (SUMO-2/3) accumulate in cells exposed to various stress stimuli or to MG132 treatment. Although the proteins modified by SUMO-2/3 during heat shock or under MG132 treatment have been identified, the significance of this modification remains unclear. Our data show that the inhibition of translation by puromycin or cycloheximide blocks both the heat shock and MG132 induced accumulation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates in HEK 293T and U2OS cells. However, the heat shock induced accumulation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates was restored by proteasome inhibition, which suggests that the inhibition of translation did not abolish SUMOylation itself. Furthermore, we show that some of the proteins truncated due to the treatment by low concentration of puromycin are SUMOylated in HEK 293T cells. We suggest that the SUMO-2/3 conjugates accumulating under the heat shock or MG132 treatment result largely from new protein synthesis and that portion of them is incorrectly folded.

Abstract: Stress hormone, glutamatergic system, serotonergic system and the noradrenergic system are involved in depressive disorders. However, the relationship among these is still unclear. The present study examined the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on the presynaptic glutamate release of synaptosomes from the rat's prelimbic cortex by using biochemical methods combined with pharmacological approaches. The results showed that dexamethasone increased the glutamate release of synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration–response relationship of this effect of DEX was inverse U-shaped with a maximum at 3μm. Further study showed that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist and GR siRNA had no effect on the DEX-induced glutamate release but 5-HT3 receptor antagonist could block the DEX-induced glutamate release which suggested that DEX produced the increased effect on the glutamate release not by GR, but through the activation of the 5-HT3 receptors which led to the influx of extrasynaptosomal Ca2+. Moreover, β3 adrenergic receptor agonist could block the DEX-induced glutamate release. This result suggested that the effect of DEX on the glutamate release could be regulated by noradrenergic system. The mechanism study showed that β3 adrenergic receptors regulated the DEX-induced glutamate release via Gs protein–adenylate cyclase (AC)–protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway.

Abstract: Satellite cells are resident stem cells of skeletal muscle; they are normally quiescent but upon post-trauma activation start to proliferate and fuse with damaged fibers contributing to muscle regeneration. In this study the effect of the bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) on the proliferative and migratory response of murine satellite cells has been examined. S1P was found to stimulate labeled thymidine incorporation in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Moreover, by employing selective S1P receptor agonists and antagonists and silencing individual S1P receptors, the mitogenic action of S1P in satellite cells was shown to depend on S1P2 and S1P3. Notably, by using different experimental approaches S1P was found to positively influence satellite cell migration, necessary for their recruitment at the site of muscle damage. Interestingly, the specific silencing of individual S1P receptor subtypes demonstrated the pivotal role of S1P1 and S1P4 in mediating the S1P migratory effect. This latter result demonstrates for the first time that S1P4 receptor has a role in skeletal muscle cells, supporting the notion that this receptor subtype plays a biological action broader than that so far identified in lymphoid tissue. On the contrary, S1P2 was found to negatively regulate cell migration. Collectively, these results are in favour of an important function of S1P in satellite cell biology that could in principle be exploited as novel pharmacological target for improving skeletal muscle regeneration.

Abstract: The tumor suppressor Pdcd4 is involved in multiple pathways. Considering its biological action conflicting data in the literature exist and, consequently, our own studies point to a cell type specific action of Pdcd4. In the present study, using several Pdcd4 knock down cell lines we succeeded to identify angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) as a gene up-regulated on the mRNA and protein level. The subsequent enhanced peptide secretion forced wild type Bon-1 cells in a neoplastic direction demonstrated by increased proliferation and colony formation while cell adhesion was decreased. Most likely, the stimulation of Ang-2 is in part mediated by increased activation of AP-1 but different signal transduction pathways may also be involved since we found opposite activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK7ERK pathways (both known to regulate in Ang-2 expression). Ang-2 is a modulator of vascular remodeling. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of supernatants from Pdcd4 knock-down cell lines on endothelial cells. Again, we detected reduced cell adhesion and increased colony formation. Probably, the most impressive effect was described on tube formation in a model for angiogenesis. Tube length and junctions of endothelial cells treated with conditioned medium from Pdcd4 knock-down cells were considerably increased. Both, up-regulation of Ang-2 and down-regulation of Pdcd4 are described for many tumors. However, this is the first study showing a direct impact of Pdcd4 on Ang-2 levels and, thereby, angiogenesis. Our data suggest a completely new mechanism for Pdcd4 to act as a tumor suppressor rendering Pdcd4 an attractive target for new therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Poor oxygenation (hypoxia) influences important physiological and pathological situations, including development, ischemia, stroke and cancer. Hypoxia induces protein synthesis inhibition that is primarily regulated at the level of initiation step. This regulation generally takes place at two stages, the phosphorylation of the subunit α of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 and the inhibition of the eIF4F complex availability by dephosphorylation of the inhibitory protein 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1). The contribution of each of them is mainly dependent of the extent of the oxygen deprivation. We have evaluated the regulation of hypoxia-induced translation inhibition in nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells subjected to a low oxygen concentration (0.1%) at several times. Our findings indicate that protein synthesis inhibition occurs primarily by the disruption of eIF4F complex through 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation, which is produced by the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity via the activation of REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage 1) protein in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-dependent manner, as well as the translocation of eIF4E to the nucleus. In addition, this mechanism is reinforced by the increase in 4E-BP1 levels, mainly at prolonged times of hypoxia.

Abstract: Autophagy is one of the cellular adaptive processes that provide protection against many pathological conditions like infection, cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging. Recent evidences suggest that ubiquitination plays an important role in degradation of proteins or defective organelle either through proteasome or autophagy. In this study, we describe the role of TRIM13, ER resident ubiquitin E3 ligase in induction of autophagy and its role during ER stress. The ectopic expression of TRIM13 in HEK-293 cells induces autophagy. Domain mapping showed that coiled-coil (CC) domain is required for induction of autophagy. TRIM13 is stabilized during ER stress, interacts with p62/SQSTM1 and co-localizes with DFCP1. TRIM13 regulates initiation of autophagy during ER stress and decreases the clonogenic ability of the cells. This study for the first time demonstrates the role of TRIM13 in induction of autophagy which may play an important role in regulation of ER stress and may act as tumor suppressor.

Abstract: Wnt signaling plays critical roles in development of both tetrapod lung and fish swimbladder, which are the two evolutionary homologous organs. Our previous data reveal that down-regulation of Wnt signaling leads to defective swimbladder development. However, the effects of up-regulation of Wnt signaling on swimbladder development remain unclear. By knockdown of the Wnt protein inhibitory gene wif1, we demonstrated that up-regulation of Wnt signaling also resulted in perturbed development of the swimbladder. Specifically, the growth of epithelium and mesenchyme was greatly inhibited, the smooth muscle differentiation was abolished, and the organization of mesothelium was disturbed. Furthermore, our data reveal that it is the reduced cell proliferation, but not enhanced apoptosis, that contributes to the disturbance of swimbladder development in wif1 morphants. Blocking Wnt signaling by the Wnt antagonist IWR-1 did not affect wif1 expression in the swimbladder, but complete suppression of Hedgehog signaling in smo−/− mutants abolished wif expression, consistent with our earlier report of a negative feedback regulation of Wnt signaling in the swimbladder by the Hedgehog signaling. Our works established the importance of proper level of Wnt signaling for normal development of swimbladder in zebrafish.

Abstract: The phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway plays a critical role in oncogenesis and the dysregulation of this pathway through loss of PTEN is a particularly common phenomenon in aggressive prostate cancers. Several recent studies have indicated that ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, and its derivatives inhibit the growth of cancer cells by cell cycle arrest and the stimulation of apoptosis. In the present study, we report a novel autophagic response of UA in PTEN-deficient PC3 prostate cancer cells. As one of the major types of programmed cell death, autophagy has been observed in response to several anticancer drugs and demonstrated to be responsible for cell death. UA-induced autophagy in PC3 cells is associated with the reduced cell viability and the enhanced expression of LC3-II, an autophagosome marker in mammals, and monodansylcadaverine incorporation into autolysosomes. Furthermore, we found that UA exhibited anti-proliferative effects characterized by G1 phase arrest and autophagy at an early stage that precedes apoptosis. We also show that UA-induced autophagy in PC3 cells are mediated through the Beclin-1 and Akt/mTOR pathways. Inhibition of autophagy by either 3-methyladenine or Beclin-1/Atg5 small interfering RNA enhanced UA-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism in PC3 cells against UA-induced apoptosis and a rational for the use of autophagy inhibitors in combination with UA as a novel modality of cancer therapy.

Abstract: Caspases are key effectors of programmed cell death. Down- and up-regulation of their activity are involved in different pathologies. In most cells, zVAD-fmk prevents apoptosis. However, unexpected effects of zVAD-fmk have been characterized in different laboratories, cell models and cell death processes. We have previously shown that zVAD-fmk accelerates p53-dependent apoptosis in rat embryonic fibroblasts. In this study, we pursued our investigations on zVAD-fmk effects and focused our study at the mitochondrial level in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In both primary and immortalized (by AgT or 3T9 protocol) MEFs, zVAD-fmk increased etoposide-induced loss of ΔΨm. This increase correlated with an increase of the number of apoptotic cells in primary and 3T9 MEFs, but did not in AgT MEFs. In both types of immortalized MEFs, zVAD-fmk regulated neither p53 levels nor transcriptional activities, suggesting that zVAD-fmk acts downstream of p53. In MEFs, zVAD-fmk increased p53-dependent loss of ΔΨm, cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activity. Indeed, zVAD-fmk inhibited effector caspases (caspases-3, -6, -7) as expected but increased caspase-9 cleavage and activity in etoposide-treated MEFs. Q-VD-OPh, another caspase inhibitor, also increased both loss of ΔΨm and caspase-9 cleavage in etoposide-treated MEFs. Invalidation of bax and bak suppressed p53-dependent cell death and zVAD-fmk regulation of this process. Invalidation of caspase-9 did not inhibit mitochondrial membrane depolarization but suppressed zVAD-fmk amplification of this process. Altogether, our data suggest that caspase-9 activity is up-regulated by zVAD-fmk and is involved in an amplification loop of etoposide-induced cell death at the mitochondrial level in MEFs.

Abstract: Sensing systems based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to monitor enzymatic reactions, protein–protein interactions, changes in conformation, and Ca2+ oscillations in studies on cellular dynamics. We developed a series of FRET-based chimeric bioprobes, each consisting of fluorescent protein attached to a fluorescent dye. Green and red fluorescent proteins were used as donors and a series of Alexa Fluor dyes was used as acceptors. The basic fluorescent proteins were substituted with appropriate amino acids for recognition of the target (caspase-3) and subjected to site-directed modification with a fluorescent dye. Variants that retained similar emission profiles to the parent proteins were readily derived for use as FRET-based bioprobes with various fluorescent patterns by incorporating various fluorescent proteins and dyes, the nature of which could be adjusted to experimental requirements. All the constructs prepared functioned as bioprobes for quantitative measurement of caspase-3 activity in vitro. Introduction of the bioprobes into cells was so simple and efficient that activation of caspase-3 upon apoptosis could be monitored by means of cytometric analysis. FRET-based bioprobes are valuable tool for high-throughput flow-cytometric analysis of many cellular events when used in conjunction with other fluorescent labels or markers. Statistical dynamic studies on living cells could provide indications of paracrine signaling.

Abstract: Syk is a 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase that regulates signaling through multiple cell surface receptors including those for antigens, immunoglobulins and proteins of the extracellular matrix. As part of its function, Syk binds a variety of downstream effectors through interactions that are often mediated by motifs that recognize phosphotyrosines. In a search for novel Syk-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified tensin2 as a Syk-binding protein. Syk interacts with a fragment of tensin2 located near the C-terminus that contains SH2 and PTB domains. In epithelial cells, tensin2 localizes both to focal adhesions and to large cytoplasmic puncta. It is within these punctuate structures that Syk and tensin2 are co-localized. The clustering of Syk within these structures leads to its phosphorylation on tyrosine.

Abstract: The placenta produces a wide number of molecules that play essential roles in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. In this context, leptin has emerged as an important player in reproduction. The synthesis of leptin in normal trophoblastic cells is regulated by different endogenous biochemical agents, but the regulation of placental leptin expression is still poorly understood. We have previously reported that 17β-estradiol (E2) up-regulates placental leptin expression. To improve the understanding of estrogen receptor mechanisms in regulating leptin gene expression, in the current study we examined the effect of membrane-constrained E2 conjugate, E-BSA, on leptin expression in human placental cells. We have found that leptin expression was induced by E-BSA both in BeWo cells and human placental explants, suggesting that E2 also exerts its effects through membrane receptors. Moreover E-BSA rapidly activated different MAPKs and AKT pathways, and these pathways were involved in E2 induced placental leptin expression. On the other hand we demonstrated the presence of ERα associated to the plasma membrane of BeWo cells. We showed that E2 genomic and nongenomic actions could be mediated by ERα. Supporting this idea, the downregulation of ERα level through a specific siRNA, decreased E-BSA effects on leptin expression. Taken together, these results provide new evidence of the mechanisms whereby E2 regulates leptin expression in placenta and support the importance of leptin in placental physiology.

Abstract: Russell bodies are intracellular aggregates of immunoglobulins. Although the mechanism of Russell body biogenesis has been extensively studied by using truncated mutant heavy chains, the importance of the variable domain sequences in this process and in immunoglobulin biosynthesis remains largely unknown. Using a panel of structurally and functionally normal human immunoglobulin Gs, we show that individual immunoglobulin G clones possess distinctive Russell body inducing propensities that can surface differently under normal and abnormal cellular conditions. Russell body inducing predisposition unique to each immunoglobulin G clone was corroborated by the intrinsic physicochemical properties encoded in the heavy chain variable domain/light chain variable domain sequence combinations that define each immunoglobulin G clone. While the sequence based intrinsic factors predispose certain immunoglobulin G clones to be more prone to induce Russell bodies, extrinsic factors such as stressful cell culture conditions also play roles in unmasking Russell body propensity from immunoglobulin G clones that are normally refractory to developing Russell bodies. By taking advantage of heterologous expression systems, we dissected the roles of individual subunit chains in Russell body formation and examined the effect of non-cognate subunit chain pair co-expression on Russell body forming propensity. The results suggest that the properties embedded in the variable domain of individual light chain clones and their compatibility with the partnering heavy chain variable domain sequences underscore the efficiency of immunoglobulin G biosynthesis, the threshold for Russell body induction, and the level of immunoglobulin G secretion. We propose that an interplay between the unique properties encoded in variable domain sequences and the state of protein homeostasis determines whether an immunoglobulin G expressing cell will develop the Russell body phenotype in a dynamic cellular setting.

Abstract: Nur77, Nurr1 and NOR-1 form the NR4A subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily and have been shown to regulate various biological processes among which are cell survival and differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and metabolism. These nuclear receptors have been proposed to act in a ligand-independent manner and we aim to gain insight in the regulation of NR4A activity. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 as a novel binding partner of NR4As, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Pin1 enhances the transcriptional activity of all three NR4A nuclear receptors and increases protein stability of Nur77 through inhibition of its ubiquitination. Enhanced transcriptional activity of NR4As requires the WW-domain of Pin1 that interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain of Nur77. Most remarkably, this enhanced activity is independent of Pin1 isomerase activity. A systematic mutation analysis of all 17 Ser/Thr-Pro-motifs in Nur77 revealed that Pin1 enhances protein stability of Nur77 in an isomerase-dependent manner by acting on phosphorylated Nur77 involving protein kinase CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser152-Pro153 motif in Nur77. Given the role of Nur77 in vascular disease and metabolism, this novel regulation mechanism provides perspectives to manipulate Nur77 activity to attenuate these processes.

Abstract: Lung surfactant secretion involves lamellar body docking and fusion with the plasma membrane in alveolar type II cells. Annexin A7 (A7) is postulated to play a role in membrane fusion during exocytosis. Our recent studies demonstrated increased co-localization of A7 with ABCA3 in lamellar bodies in type II cells stimulated with established secretagogues of lung surfactant. In this study, we investigated in vivo and in vitro interactions of A7 with the t-SNARE protein, SNAP23. Immuno-fluorescence studies showed time-dependent increases in co-localization of A7 with SNAP23 in PMA- and in A23187-stimulated cells. PMA and A23187 also caused a time-dependent increase in co-localization of ABCA3 with SNAP23. The relocation of A7 to SNAP23 domains was inhibited in the presence of PKC inhibitor, similar to that previously reported for co-localization of A7 with ABCA3. The interaction of A7 and SNAP23 was confirmed by affinity binding and by in vitro interaction of recombinant A7 and SNAP23 proteins. The in vitro binding of recombinant A7 (rA7) to GST-SNAP23 fusion protein was calcium-dependent. Phosphorylation of rA7 with PKC increased its in vitro binding to SNAP23 suggesting that a similar mechanism may operate during A7 relocation to t-SNARE domains. Thus, our studies demonstrate that annexin A7 may function in co-ordination with SNARE proteins and that protein kinase activation may be required for annexin A7 trafficking to the interacting membranes (lamellar bodies and plasma membrane) to facilitate membrane fusion during surfactant secretion.

Abstract: Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indispensible for T cell activation-induced expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and CD95 ligand (CD95L, FasL/Apo-1L) genes, and in turn, for CD95L-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD). Here, we show that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD/SOD2), a major mitochondrial antioxidative enzyme, constitutes an important control switch in the process of activation-induced oxidative signal generation in T cells. Analysis of the kinetics of T cell receptor (TCR)-triggered ROS production revealed a temporal association between higher MnSOD abundance/activity and a shut-down phase of oxidative signal generation. Transient or inducible MnSOD overexpression abrogated T cell activation-triggered mitochondrial ROS production as well as NF-κB- and AP-1-mediated transcription. Consequently, lowered expression of IL-2 and CD95L genes resulted in decreased IL-2 secretion and CD95L-dependent AICD. Moreover, upregulation of the mitochondrial MnSOD level is dependent on oxidation-sensitive transcription and not on the increase of mitochondrial mass. Thus, MnSOD-mediated negative feedback regulation of activation-induced mitochondrial ROS generation exemplifies a process of retrograde mitochondria-to-nucleus communication. Our finding underlines the critical role for MnSOD and mitochondria in the regulation of human T cell activation.

Abstract: NF-κB regulates the expression of Cyclin D1 (CD1), while RAC3 is an NF-κB coactivator that enhances its transcriptional activity. In this work, we investigated the regulatory role of CD1 on NF-κB activity. We found that CD1 inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activity through a corepressor function that can be reverted by over-expressing RAC3. In both, tumoral and non-tumoral cells, the expression pattern of RAC3 and CD1 is regulated by the cell cycle, showing a gap between the maximal expression levels of each protein. The individual increase, by transfection, of either CD1 or RAC3 enhances cell proliferation. However the simultaneous and constitutive over-expression of both proteins has an inhibitory effect. Our results suggest that the relative amounts of CD1 and RAC3, and the timing of expression of these oncogenes could tilt the balance of tumor cell proliferation in response to external signals.

Abstract: Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid elevated in asthmatic airways, is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in respiratory disease. S1P activates receptor-mediated signaling to modulate diverse cellular functions and promote airway inflammation. Although many of the stimulatory pathways activated by S1P have been delineated, especially mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the question of whether S1P exerts negative feedback control on its own signaling cascade via upregulation of phosphatases remains unexplored. We show that S1P rapidly and robustly upregulates mRNA and protein expression of the MAPK deactivator–MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Utilizing the pivotal airway structural cell, airway smooth muscle (ASM), we confirm that S1P activates all members of the MAPK family and, in part, S1P upregulates MKP-1 expression in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. MKP-1 is a cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein-responsive gene and here, we reveal for the first time that an adenylate cyclase/PKA/CREB-mediated pathway also contributes to S1P-induced MKP-1. Thus, by increasing MKP-1 expression via parallel p38 MAPK- and CREB-mediated pathways, S1P temporally regulates MAPK signaling pathways by upregulating the negative feedback controller MKP-1. This limits the extent and duration of pro-inflammatory MAPK signaling and represses cytokine secretion in ASM cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that S1P stimulates both kinases and the phosphatase MKP-1 to control inflammation in ASM cells and may provide a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pro-asthmatic functions induced by the potent bioactive sphingolipid S1P in the lung.

Abstract: Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) plays a significant role in the regulation of growth, apoptosis, and differentiation in a diversity of cell types. We investigated the effect of PKCδ on Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD)-mediated transcription with Notch transcription reporter constructs. The results indicate that co-expression of PKCδ down-regulated NICD-dependent transcription. Co-expression of a dominant negative PKCδ (K376R) variant lacking kinase activity was also able to downregulate NICD-dependent transcription, suggesting that PKCδ exerts its inhibitory effect via a kinase-independent mechanism(s). Interestingly, expression of PKCδ as well as K376R induced NICD up-regulation by inhibiting proteasome-mediated degradation of NICD, indicating that NICD protein quantity is not proportional to its transcriptional activity. When the subcellular distribution of NICD was investigated by both subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry, it was found that PKCδ and K376R effectively impaired proper nuclear localization of NICD, possibly via a physical association between NICD and PKCδ, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that both PKCδ and K376R inhibit the association of NICD with the promoter region of its target gene, Hes1. Furthermore, silencing of PKCδ resulted in increased NICD nuclear localization and NICD transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells. PKCδ silencing-induced increase in anti-apoptotic survivin could not rescue apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. The data herein indicate that PKCδ can induce down-regulation of NICD transcriptional activity via a kinase-independent inhibition of NICD nuclear targeting and dissociation of NICD from target gene promoters.

Abstract: The metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1, also termed MRE-binding transcription factor-1 or metal regulatory transcription factor-1) is a pluripotent transcriptional regulator involved in cellular adaptation to various stress conditions, primarily exposure to heavy metals but also to hypoxia or oxidative stress. MTF-1 is evolutionarily conserved from insects to humans and is the main activator of metallothionein genes, which encode small cysteine-rich proteins that can scavenge toxic heavy metals and free radicals. MTF-1 has been suggested to act as an intracellular metal sensor but evidence for direct metal sensing was scarce. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of MTF-1 regulation with a focus on the mechanism underlying heavy metal responsiveness and transcriptional activation mediated by mammalian or Drosophila MTF-1. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cell Biology of Metals.

Abstract: Glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells depends on mitochondrial activation. In the organelle, glucose-derived pyruvate is metabolised along the oxidative and anaplerotic pathway to generate downstream signals leading to insulin granule exocytosis. Entry into the oxidative pathway is catalysed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and controlled in part by phosphorylation of the PDH E1α subunit blocking enzyme activity. We find that glucose but not other nutrient secretagogues induce PDH E1α phosphorylation in INS-1E cells and rat islets. INS-1E cells and primary β-cells express pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, 2 and 3, which mediate the observed phosphorylation. In INS-1E cells, suppression of the two main isoforms, PDK1 and PDK3, almost completely prevented PDH E1α phosphorylation. Under basal glucose conditions, phosphorylation was barely detectable and therefore the enzyme almost fully active (90% of maximal). During glucose stimulation, PDH is only partially inhibited (to 78% of maximal). Preventing PDH phosphorylation in situ after suppression of PDK1, 2 and 3 neither enhanced pyruvate oxidation nor insulin secretion. In conclusion, although glucose stimulates E1α phosphorylation and therefore inhibits PDH activity, this control mechanism by itself does not alter metabolism-secretion coupling in INS-1E clonal β-cells.

Abstract: Little is known about either the basal or stimulated homeostatic mechanisms regulating nuclear tenure of Nf-e2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that mediates expression of over 200 detoxification genes. Our data show that stress-induced nuclear Nrf2 accumulation is largely from de novo protein synthesis, rather than translocation from a pre-existing cytoplasmic pool. HepG2 cells were used to monitor nuclear Nrf2 24h following treatment with the dithiol micronutrient (R)-α-lipoic acid (LA; 50μM), or vehicle. LA caused a ≥2.5-fold increase in nuclear Nrf2 within 1h. However, pretreating cells with cycloheximide (50μg/ml) inhibited LA-induced Nrf2 nuclear accumulation by 94%. Providing cells with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, decreased basal Nrf2 levels by 84% after 4h, but LA overcame this inhibition. LA-mediated de novo protein translation was confirmed using HepG2 cells transfected with a bicistronic construct containing an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) for Nrf2, with significant (P<0.05) increase in IRES use under LA treatment. These results suggest that a dithiol stimulus mediates Nrf2 nuclear tenure via cap-independent protein translation. Thus, translational control of Nrf2 synthesis, rather than reliance solely on pre-existing protein, may mediate the rapid burst of Nrf2 nuclear accumulation following stress stimuli.

Abstract: Although cancers can be initially treated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, gefitinib, continued gefitinib therapy does not benefit the survival of patients due to acquired resistance through EGFR mutations, c-MET amplification, or epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is of further interest to determine whether mesenchymal-like, but not epithelial-like, cancer cells can become resistant to gefitinib by bypassing EGFR signaling and acquiring alternative routes of proliferative and survival signaling. Here we examined whether gefitinib resistance of cancer cells can be caused by transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5), which has been shown to induce EMT via cytosolic p27Kip1 stabilization. Gefitinib-resistant cells exhibited higher and/or sustained TM4SF5 expression, cytosolic p27Kip1 stabilization, and mesenchymal phenotypes, compared with gefitinib-sensitive cells. Conversion of gefitinib-sensitive to -resistant cells by introduction of the T790M EGFR mutation caused enhanced and sustained expression of TM4SF5, phosphorylation of p27Kip1 Ser10 (responsible for cytosolic location), loss of E-cadherin from cell–cell contacts, and gefitinib-resistant EGFR and survival signaling activities. Additionally, TM4SF5 overexpression lessened the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib. Suppression of TM4SF5 or p27Kip1 in gefitinib-resistant cells via the T790M EGFR mutation or TM4SF5 expression rendered them gefitinib-sensitive, displaying more epithelial-like and less mesenchymal-like characteristics. Together, these results indicate that TM4SF5-mediated EMT may have an important function in the gefitinib resistance of cancer cells.

Abstract: Acquisition of death-resistance is critical in the evolution of neoplasia. Our aim was to model the early stages of carcinogenesis by examining intracellular alterations in cells that have acquired apoptosis-resistance after exposure to a complex genotoxin. We previously generated sub-populations of BJ-hTERT human diploid fibroblasts, which have acquired death-resistance following exposure to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], a broad-spectrum genotoxicant. Long-term exposure to certain forms of Cr(VI) is associated with respiratory carcinogenesis. Here, we report on the death-sensitivity of subclonal populations derived from clonogenic survivors of BJ-hTERT cells treated with 5μM Cr(VI) (DR1, DR2), or selected by dilution-based cloning without treatment (CC1). Following Cr(VI) treatment, CC1 cells downregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and exhibited extensive expression of cleaved caspase 3. In contrast, the DR cells exhibited no cleaved caspase 3 expression and maintained expression of Bcl-2 following recovery from 24h Cr(VI) exposure. The DR cells also exhibited attenuated mitochondrial-membrane depolarization and mitochondrial retention of cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO following Cr(VI) exposure. The DR cells exhibited less basal mtDNA damage, as compared to CC1 cells, which correlates with intrinsic (non-induced) death-resistance. Notably, there was no difference in p53 protein expression before or after treatment among all cell lines. Taken together, our data suggest the presence of more resilient mitochondria in death-resistant cells, and that death-resistance can be acquired in normal human cells early after genotoxin exposure. We postulate that resistance to mitochondrial-mediated cell death and mitochondrial dysregulation may be an initial phenotypic alteration observed in early stage carcinogenesis.

Abstract: The HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium channel aids in the repolarization of the cardiomyocyte membrane at the end of each action potential. We have previously shown that sustained protein kinase A or C (PKA and PKC) activity specifically enhances channel synthesis over the course of hours to days in heterologous expression and cardiac myocytes. The kinase-mediated augmentation of the channel is post-transcriptional and occurs near or at the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report our further investigations into the mechanisms of kinase-mediated augmentation of HERG channel protein. We show that HERG channel phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for the PKA-dependent increase to occur. In vitro translation studies indicate that an additional factor is required for the process. Pharmacologic inhibitors suggest that the channel augmentation is not due to kinase-mediated alteration in proteasome or lysosome activity. PKA activation had no effect on stability of HERG mRNA and polyribosomal profiling showed that kinase activity did not elevate translation from low to high rates. Transcriptional inhibition results suggest that the additional cellular factor is a PKA-regulated protein. Together, these findings suggest that PKA-mediated augmentation of HERG abundance is more complex than previously appreciated involving enhancement of already active translation rates, phosphorylation of the channel protein and at least one other cyclic-AMP/PKA-responsive protein. Further exploration of molecular components of this regulatory pathway will be necessary to determine exact mechanism and the biomedical impact of this process in vivo.

Abstract: The abundance of dead macrophages in close proximity to HOCl-modified proteins in advanced atherosclerotic plaques implicates HOCl in the killing of macrophages and the formation of the necrotic core region. The mechanism of HOCl mediated death of macrophages was unknown, so using human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDM) we here have shown that HOCl causes a rapid necrotic cell death characterized by loss of MTT reduction, cellular ATP and cell lysis without caspase-3 activation in HMDM cells. The HOCl causes a rise in cytosolic calcium level via the plasma membrane L- and T-type calcium channels and endoplasmic reticulum RyR channel. Blocking of the calcium channels or the addition of calpain inhibitors prevents the HOCl mediated loss of mitochondrial potential, lysosome failure and HMDM cell death. Blocking MPT-pore formation with cyclosporin A also prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomal destabilization and HMDM cell death. Blocking the calcium mitochondrial uniporter with ruthenium red also blocks the loss of mitochondrial potential but only at high concentrations. HOCl appears to cause HMDM cell death through destabilization of cytosolic calcium control resulting in the failure of both the mitochondria and lysosomes.

Abstract: Bap31 is an integral ER membrane protein which functions as an escort factor in the sorting of newly synthesized membrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During apoptosis signaling, Bap31 is subject to early cleavage by initiator caspase-8. The resulting p20Bap31 (p20) fragment has been shown to initiate proapoptotic ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transmission, and to exert dominant negative (DN) effects on ER protein trafficking. We now report that ectopic expression of p20 in E1A/DNp53-transformed baby mouse kidney epithelial cells initiates a non-apoptotic form of cell death with paraptosis-like morphology. This pathway was characterized by an early rise in ER Ca2+ stores and massive dilation of the ER/nuclear envelope, dependent on intact ER Ca2+ stores. Ablation of the Bax/Bak genes had no effect on these ER/nuclear envelope transformations, and delayed but did not prevent cell death. ER-restricted expression of Bcl2 in the absence of Bax/Bak, however, delayed both ER/nuclear envelope dilation and cell death. This prosurvival role of Bcl2 at the ER thus extended beyond inhibition of Bax/Bak, and correlated with its ability to lower ER Ca2+ stores. Furthermore, these results indicate that ER restricted Bcl2 is capable of antagonizing not only apoptosis, but also a non-apoptotic, Bax/Bak independent, paraptosis-like form of cell death.

Abstract: Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a key protein in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling whose tyrosine phosphorylation by the type 1 IGF receptor is necessary for the recruitment and activation of the downstream effectors. Through the analysis of cross-talks occurring between different tyrosine kinase receptor-dependent signaling pathways, we investigated how two growth factors [epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)] could modulate the IGF-I-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its downstream signaling. EGF and FGF inhibited IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the subsequent IGF-I-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity. These EGF- and FGF-inhibitory effects were dependent on both PI 3-kinase and protein kinase D1 (PKD1) signaling pathways but independent on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. PKD1, which was activated independently of the PI 3-kinase pathway, associated with IRS-1 in response to EGF or FGF. Unlike PI 3-kinase, PKD1 did not mediate the EGF- or FGF-induced-IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation which was described to inhibit IRS-1. Interestingly, specific inhibition of either PI 3-kinase or PKD1 totally impaired EGF- or FGF-induced inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. This indicated that serine 307 phosphorylation of IRS-1 is not sufficient per se to inhibit the IGF signaling pathway and demonstrated for the first time that the negative regulation of IRS-1 requires the coordinated action of PI 3-kinase and PKD1. This further suggests that PKD1 may be an attractive target for innovative strategies that target the IGF signaling pathway.

Abstract: The AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97 controls a large array of cellular functions including protein degradation, cell division, membrane fusion through its ability to interact with and control the fate of ubiquitylated proteins. More recently, Cdc48/p97 also appeared to be involved in autophagy, a catabolic cell response that has long been viewed as completely distinct from the Ubiquitine/Proteasome System. In particular, conjugation by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins as well as ubiquitin binding proteins such as Cdc48/p97 and its cofactors can target degradation by both catabolic pathways. This review will focus on the recently described functions of Cdc48/p97 in autophagosome biogenesis as well as selective autophagy. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: AAA ATPases: structure and function.

Abstract: Akt is an essential protein kinase for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Perturbed Akt regulation is associated with a number of human diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. Recently, evidence has emerged that Akt is involved in the regulation of the sterol-regulatory element binding proteins, which are master transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism. This offers a means by which synthesis of new membrane can be coordinated with cell growth and proliferation. However, the link between Akt and sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2, the major isoform participating in cholesterol regulation, is relatively unexplored. In the present study, we employed insulin-like growth factor-1 as an inducer of Akt signalling, and showed that it increased sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2 activation acutely (within 1h). This insulin-like growth factor-1-induced sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2 activation was blunted when Akt was inhibited pharmacologically or molecularly with small interfering RNA. Furthermore, we employed a rapalog heterodimerisation system to specifically and rapidly activate Akt, and found that sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2 activation was increased in response to Akt activation. Together, this study provides compelling evidence that Akt contributes to the acute regulation of cholesterol metabolism through activating sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced α1B-adrenergic receptor desensitization and phosphorylation were studied in rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged adrenoceptors. Sphingosine-1-phosphate induced adrenoceptor desensitization and phosphorylation through a signaling cascade that involved phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C activities. The autocrine/paracrine role of sphingosine-1-phosphate was also studied. It was observed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors increased sphingosine kinase activity. Such activation and consequent production of sphingosine-1-phosphate appear to be functionally relevant in IGF-I- and EGF-induced α1B-adrenoceptor phosphorylation and desensitization as evidenced by the following facts: a) expression of a catalytically inactive (dominant-negative) mutant of sphingosine kinase 1 or b) S1P1 receptor knockdown markedly reduced this growth factor action. This action of sphingosine-1-phosphate involves EGF receptor transactivation. In addition, taking advantage of the presence of the eGFP tag in the receptor construction, we showed that S1P was capable of inducing α1B-adrenergic receptor internalization and that its autocrine/paracrine generation was relevant for internalization induced by IGF-I. Four distinct hormone receptors and two autocrine/paracrine mediators participate in IGF-I receptor–α1B-adrenergic receptor crosstalk.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that lipids influence the assembly and efficiency of membrane-embedded macromolecular complexes. Similarly, lipids have been found to influence chloroplast precursor protein binding to the membrane surface and to be associated with the Translocon of the Outer membrane of Chloroplasts (TOC). We used a system based on chloroplast outer envelope vesicles from Pisum sativum to obtain an initial understanding of the influence of lipids on precursor protein translocation across the outer envelope. The ability of the model precursor proteins p(OE33)titin and pSSU to be recognized and translocated in this simplified system was investigated. We demonstrate that transport across the outer membrane can be observed in the absence of the inner envelope translocon. The translocation, however, was significantly slower than that observed for chloroplasts. Enrichment of outer envelope vesicles with different lipids natively found in chloroplast membranes altered the binding and transport behavior. Further, the results obtained using outer envelope vesicles were consistent with the results observed for the reconstituted isolated TOC complex. Based on both approaches we concluded that the lipids sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) increased TOC-mediated binding and import for both precursor proteins. In contrast, enrichment in digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) improved TOC-mediated binding for pSSU, but decreased import for both precursor proteins. Optimal import occurred only in a narrow concentration range of DGDG.

Abstract: Emerging evidence from therapeutic trials in humans and animal models suggests that in the treatment of depression, antidepressants play a role by targeting the glutamatergic system. Fluvoxamine is one of the widely used SSRIs which has been considered to target monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms. However, whether fluvoxamine has an effect on the glutamate release is still unclear. The present experiment studied the effect of fluvoxamine on presynaptic glutamate release in prelimbic cortex, both in control C57BL/6 mice and chronic restraint stress C57BL/6 mice, and further investigated the mechanism underlying this effect by using patch clamp, on-line fluorimetry, pharmacological approaches combined with other techniques. The results showed that fluvoxamine increased the glutamate release in the depression model mice but it had no effect on the glutamate release in the control mice. The mechanism underlying these effects in depression model mice was that, fluvoxamine firstly activated presynaptic 5-HT3 receptors, which transiently increased the Ca2+ concentration. The increase of Ca2+ concentration via 5-HT3 receptors caused the activation of sigma-1 receptors, which were activated by fluvoxamine. The activation of sigma-1 receptors increased the intrasynaptosomal Ca2+ concentration significantly through the outflow of endoplasmic reticulum calcium and finally activated PKC. These results suggested that fluvoxamine may have a selective effect and different mechanism based on the condition of animal.

Abstract: In mammalian cells, inflammation is mainly mediated by the binding of tumor necrosis factor alpha to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. In this study, we investigated lateral dynamics of TNF-R1 before and after ligand binding using high-density single-particle tracking in combination with photoactivated localization microscopy. Our single-molecule data indicates the presence of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 with different mobilities in the plasma membrane, suggesting different molecular organizations. Cholesterol depletion led to a decrease of slow receptor species and a strong increase in the average diffusion coefficient. Moreover, as a consequence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment, the mean diffusion coefficient moderately increased while its distribution narrowed. Based on our observation, we propose a refined mechanism on the structural arrangement and activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 in the plasma membrane.
