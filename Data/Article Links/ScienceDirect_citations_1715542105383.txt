Abstract: The Protein kinase B (AKT) regulates a plethora of intracellular signaling proteins to fine-tune signaling of multiple pathways. Here, we found that following B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase SYK and the adaptor BLNK, the AKT/PKB enzyme strongly induced BLNK (>100-fold) and SYK (>100-fold) serine/threonine phosphorylation (pS/pT). Increased phosphorylation promoted 14-3-3 binding to BLNK (37-fold) and SYK (2.5-fold) in a pS/pT-concentration dependent manner. We also demonstrated that the AKT inhibitor MK2206 reduced pS/pT of both BLNK (3-fold) and SYK (2.5-fold). Notably, the AKT phosphatase, PHLPP2 maintained the activating phosphorylation of BLNK at Y84 and increased protein stability (8.5-fold). In addition, 14-3-3 was required for the regulation SYK⿿s interaction with BLNK and attenuated SYK binding to Importin 7 (5-fold), thereby perturbing shuttling to the nucleus. Moreover, 14-3-3 proteins also sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of SYK and BLNK. Furthermore, substitution of S295 or S297 for alanine abrogated SYK⿿s binding to Importin 7. SYK with S295A or S297A replacements showed intense pY525/526 phosphorylation, and BLNK pY84 phosphorylation correlated with the SYK pY525/526 phosphorylation level. Conversely, the corresponding mutations to aspartic acid in SYK reduced pY525/526 phosphorylation. Collectively, these and previous results suggest that AKT and 14-3-3 proteins down-regulate the activity of several BCR-associated components, including BTK, BLNK and SYK and also inhibit SYK⿿s interaction with Importin 7.

Abstract: High altitude polycythemia (HAPC) is a serious public health problem among Han Chinese immigrants to the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. This study aims to explore the genetic basis of HAPC in the Han Chinese population. 484 male subjects (234 patients and 250 controls) were enrolled in this study. Genotyping was performed for polymorphisms of I/D in ACE, C1772T and G1790A in exon 12 of HIF-1α, rs2567206 in CYP1B1, rs726354 in SENP1, rs3025033 in VEGFA, rs7251432 in HAMP, rs2075800 in HSPA1L and rs8065364 in CARD14. Gene–gene interaction was assessed by multifactor dimensionality reduction. A significant association was seen between CARD14 polymorphism rs8065364 and risk of HAPC development in male Han Chinese, and the C allele of rs8065364 was a risk factor (odds ratio (OR)=1.59, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.21–2.08). Gene–gene interaction analysis indicated that a synergistic relationship existed between rs3025033 and rs8065364 (1.00%), rs3025033 and rs726354 (0.18%), and rs726354 and rs8065364 (0.17%). The combination of rs8065364 in CARD14, rs3025033 in VEGFA and rs726354 in SENP1 was the best model to predict HAPC development in this study (testing accuracy=0.6183, p=0.0010, cross-validated consistency=10/10). Genetic interactions of SNPs in CARD14, SENP1 and VEGFA might represent a functional mechanism in the pathogenesis of HAPC.

Abstract: The temperature dependence of initial transient current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of planar perovskite solar cell by one-step solution process is investigated. An S-shaped I-V characteristic emerges in response to low temperature and the photovoltaic parameters drop dramatically. This is mainly attributed to the increasing amount of negative charges accumulating in the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface region and the reduced built-in field separating the photo-generated carriers in the absorber layer. The influence of negative charge accumulation can be represented by two extra diodes that are in series with a conventional solar cell circuit model at low temperature whereas it acts as a resistor with low resistivity above room temperature. These findings help to understand the charge transport mechanism in perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Ion-implanted poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si), in combination with a tunnel oxide layer, is investigated as a carrier-selective passivating contact in c-Si solar cells based on an interdigitated back contact (IBC) architecture. The optimized poly-Si passivating contacts enable low interface recombination, resulting in implied VOC (iVOC) of about 720mV and 704mV for n-type and p-type, respectively, before any hydrogenation step. It is found that high-quality passivation can be obtained when confining the dopants within the poly-Si layers and realizing a shallow diffusion of dopants into the c-Si bulk, meaning a sharp decrease in doping concentration in the c-Si at the poly-Si/c-Si interface. The doping profile at the poly-Si/c-Si interface can be influenced by poly-Si layer thickness, poly-Si ion-implantation parameters, and post-implantation annealing conditions. The detailed discussion on the passivation properties of the poly-Si passivating contacts and their preparation conditions are presented in this paper. In addition, IBC solar cells with/without front surface field (FSF) are fabricated, with the optimized poly-Si passivating contacts as back surface field, BSF (n-type poly-Si), and emitter (p-type poly-Si). The best cell shows an efficiency of 21.2% (VOC=692mV, JSC=39.2mA/cm2, FF=78.3%, and pFF=83.5%).

Abstract: Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces procoagulant activity of macrophages. Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein and substance P (SP) is a pro-inflammatory neuropeptide involved in the formation of membrane blebs. This study investigated the role of SP in TF release by GM-CSF-dependent macrophages. SP significantly decreased TF levels in whole-cell lysates of GM-CSF-dependent macrophages. TF was detected in the culture supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after stimulation of macrophages by SP. Aprepitant (an SP/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist) reduced TF release from macrophages stimulated with SP. Pretreatment of macrophages with a radical scavenger(pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) also limited the decrease of TF in whole-cell lysates after stimulation with SP. A protein kinase C inhibitor (rottlerin) partially blocked this macrophage response to SP, while it was significantly inhibited by a ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) or a dynamin inhibitor (dinasore). An Akt inhibitor (perifosine) also partially blocked this response. Furthermore, siRNA targeting p22phox, β-arrestin 2, or Rho A, blunted the release of TF from macrophages stimulated with SP. In other experiments, visceral adipocytes derived from cryopreserved preadipocytes were found to produce SP. In conclusion, SP enhances the release of TF from macrophages via the p22phox/β-arrestin 2/Rho A signaling pathway.

Rev-erb agonist and TGF-β similarly affect autophagy but differentially regulate hepatic stellate cell fibrogenic phenotype,

Abstract: We demonstrated that ligand-activated nuclear receptor Rev-erbα mitigates CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Rev-erbα is also a novel regulator of autophagy, a crucial eukaryotic catabolic system in which lysosomes degrade substrates for energy generation. In hepatic stellate cells (HSC) autophagy is reportedly required for this purpose to activate HSCs during fibrogenesis. Here, we examined whether pharmacological activation of Rev-erb with its synthetic ligand SR9009 or treatment with the pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF-β, each differentially modulate autophagy to regulate the HSC phenotype. We measured the effects of SR9009 on autophagy markers in a CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model. Using primary and immortalized HSCs in vitro, we quantified SR9009 and TGF-β effects on autophagy flux. Compared with vehicle-treated controls, livers from CCl4-treated mice exhibited lower AMPK, higher P70S6K phosphorylation, elevated P62 and lower levels of ATG proteins, indicating a disruption of autophagosome (AV) formation. SR9009 treatment prevented CCl4-induced P70S6K phosphorylation but did not affect CCl4-induced changes in AMPK, ATG proteins or P62. Analysis of autophagy markers and autophagy flux in primary HSCs or an immortalized human HSC line (LX2), revealed that SR9009 exposure down-regulated AV biogenesis. These events were associated with lower levels of fibrogenic gene expression, P70S6K phosphorylation and HSC proliferation. However, HSC exposure to TGF-β enhanced fibrogenic gene expression, P70S6K phosphorylation and HSC proliferation, while it simultaneously decelerated AV synthesis. The autophagy activator rapamycin and the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin each decreased HSC activation, P70S6K phosphorylation and HSC proliferation. Furthermore, knock-down of P70S6K using siRNA blocked basal and TGF-β-induced cell proliferation in human activated LX2. We conclude that SR9009 and TGF-β both similarly affected autophagy but, differentially regulated HSC fibrogenic phenotype through modulation of P70S6K, which is crucial for cell proliferation and fibrogenesis.

Abstract: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) are Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) characterized by clonal myeloproliferation without cell maturation impairment. CML pathogenesis is associated with the Ph chromosome leading to BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase constitutive expression. The Ph negative MPN (PV, ET and PMF) are characterized by the mutation JAK2V617F of the JAK2 protein in the auto-inhibitory JH2 domain, which is found in most PV patients and in approximately half of ET and PMF patients. Considerable effort is being made to understand the role of JAK2V617F at the MPN initiation and to clarify the pathogenesis and apoptosis resistance in CML, PV, ET and PMF patients. In the present investigation, we evaluated the Death Inducer-Obliterator (DIDO) (variants DIDO 1, 2 and 3) levels in CML, PV, ET and PMF patients. Our data reported the DIDO 1, 2 and 3 differential expressions in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.

Abstract: Many translationally repressed mRNAs are deposited in the oocyte cytoplasm for progression of the meiotic cell cycle and early development. mos and cyclin B1 mRNAs encode proteins promoting oocyte meiosis, and translational control of these mRNAs is important for normal progression of meiotic cell division. We previously demonstrated that cyclin B1 mRNA forms RNA granules in the zebrafish and mouse oocyte cytoplasm and that the formation of RNA granules is crucial for regulating the timing of translational activation of the mRNA. However, whether the granule formation is specific to cyclin B1 mRNA remains unknown. In this study, we found that zebrafish mos mRNA forms granules distinct from those of cyclin B1 mRNA. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed that cyclin B1 RNA granules were assembled in dense clusters, while mos RNA granules were distributed diffusely in the animal polar cytoplasm. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis showed that the density of mos RNA granules was partly lower than that of cyclin B1 mRNA. Similar to cyclin B1 RNA granules, mos RNA granules were disassembled after initiation of oocyte maturation at the timing at which the poly(A) tail was elongated. However, while almost all of the granules of cyclin B1 were disassembled simultaneously, a fraction of mos RNA granules firstly disappeared and then a large part of them was disassembled. In addition, while cyclin B1 RNA granules were disassembled in a manner dependent on actin filament depolymerization, certain fractions of mos RNA granules were disassembled independently of actin filaments. These results suggest that cytoplasmic regulation of translationally repressed mRNAs by formation of different RNA granules is a key mechanism for translational control of distinct mRNAs in the oocyte.

Abstract: Background
YKL-40 is an inflammatory glycoprotein involved in endothelial dysfunction and elevated in sera of patients with liver diseases.
Aim
To determine serum YKL-40 among 50 children and adolescents with β-thalassemia major (β-TM) compared to 35 healthy controls and assess its relation to liver stiffness by transient elastography (TE), markers of hemolysis, iron overload and various hemolysis-associated complications.
Methods
β-TM patients asymptomatic for heart disease were studied stressing on chelation therapy, serum ferritin, liver iron concentration (LIC), cardiac T2* and YKL-40. Echocardiography and TE were performed.
Results
Liver cirrhosis (METAVIR F4; TE values>12.5kPa) was encountered in 32%. HCV-positive patients had significantly higher WBC count, alanine transaminase (ALT) and serum ferritin than HCV-negative patients. YKL-40 levels were significantly higher in β-TM patients compared with control (p<0.001). YKL-40 was significantly higher among patients with heart disease (p=0.014) or hepatitis C virus (p=0.004) than those without. YKL-40 was correlated with liver stiffness and the degree of hepatic fibrosis being highest among patients with F4 stage (p<0.001). The YKL-40 cutoff to identify β-TM patients with liver cirrhosis or heart disease was determined. Patients treated with combined chelation therapy had significantly lower levels of YKL-40 than the monotherapy group (p<0.001). YKL-40 was positively correlated with transfusion index, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin and LIC but negatively correlated with cardiac T2*.
Conclusion
YKL-40 is a promising marker of cardiovascular disease and liver siderosis in β-TM patients. The combination of YKL-40 and TE provides a reliable method to assess hepatic fibrosis in young β-TM patients.

Abstract: Organ decellularization is emerging as a promising regenerative medicine approach as it is able to provide an acellular, three-dimensional biological scaffold material that can be seeded with living cells for organ reengineering. However this application is currently limited to donor-derived decellularized organs for reengineering in vitro and no study has been conducted for re-engineering the decellularized organ in vivo. We developed a novel technique of a single liver lobe decellularization in vivo in live animals. Using a surgical method to generate a by-pass circulation through the portal vein and infra-hepatic vena cava with a perfusion chamber system, we decellularized the single liver lobe and recellularized it with allogenic primary hepatocytes. Our results showed that the decellularization process in vivo can preserve the vascular structural network and functional characteristics of the native liver lobe. It allows for efficient recellularization of the decellularized liver lobe matrix with allogenic primary hepatocytes. Upon the re-establishment of blood circulation, the recellularized liver lobe is able to gain the function and the allogenic hepatocytes are able to secret albumin. Our findings provide a proof of principle for the in vivo reengineering of liver.

Abstract: This study investigated age-associated changes to protein synthesis and degradation pathways in the quadriceps muscles of male C57BL/6J mice at 5 ages, between 4 and 24 months (m). Sarcopenia was evident by 18m and was accompanied by hyper-phosphorylation of S6K1, indicating increased mTORC1 signaling. Proteasomal and autophagosomal degradation pathways were also impacted by aging. In the 1% NP40 insoluble protein fraction, the abundance of MuRF1 increased at 24m, while p62 increased at 15m, and remained elevated at older ages. In addition, we investigated how protein synthesis and degradation pathways are modulated by fasting in young (4m) and old (24m) muscles, and showed that old mice respond to fasting less robustly compared with young. Overnight fasting for 16h caused de-phosphorylation of AKT and molecules downstream of mTORC1 (S6K1, rpS6 and 4E-BP1) in young, but not old muscles. A longer time of fasting (24h) was required to reduce phosphorylation of these molecules in old mice. Induction of MuRF1 and Fbxo32 mRNA was also more robust in young compared with old muscles following fasting for 16h. In addition, a 16h fast reduced ULK1 phosphorylation at the mTORC1 specific site Ser757 only in young muscles. The striking accumulation of insoluble p62 protein in muscles of all old male mice (fed or fasted), suggests age-related dysregulation of autophagy and protein aggregation. These data provide an insight into the mechanisms of metabolic responses that affect protein homeostasis in old skeletal muscles, with applications to design of clinical interventions that target sarcopenia.

Abstract: Most cells grown in glucose-containing medium generate almost all their ATP via glycolysis despite abundant oxygen supply and functional mitochondria, a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect. By contrast, most cells within the body rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to generate the bulk of their energy supply. Thus, when utilising the accessibility of cell culture to elucidate fundamental elements of mitochondria in health and disease, it is advantageous to adopt culture conditions under which the cells have greater reliance upon OXPHOS for the supply of their energy needs. Substituting galactose for glucose in the culture medium can provide these conditions, but additional benefit can be gained from alternate in vitro models. Herein we describe culture conditions in which complete autonomous depletion of medium glucose induces a lactate-consuming phase marked by increased MitoTracker Deep Red staining intensity, increased expression of Kreb’s cycle proteins, increased expression of electron transport chain subunits, and increased sensitivity to the OXPHOS inhibitor rotenone. We propose these culture conditions represent an alternate accessible model for the in vitro study of cellular processes and diseases involving the mitochondrion without limitations incurred via the Crabtree effect.

Abstract: Background
Cardiovascular involvement represents a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). Apelin is a peptide involved in the regulation of cardiovascular function.
Aim
To determine serum apelin among 40 children and adolescents with SCD compared with 40 healthy controls and assess its relation to markers of hemolysis, iron overload as well as cardiopulmonary complications.
Methods
SCD patients, in steady state and asymptomatic for heart disease, were studied stressing on hydroxyurea/chelation therapy, hematological profile, serum ferritin and apelin levels. Full echocardiographic study including assessment of biventricular systolic function and pulmonary artery pressure was done.
Results
Apelin levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared with controls (P<0.001). Cardiopulmonary complications were encountered in 30% of patients. Apelin was significantly decreased among patients with cardiopulmonary disease (P=0.006) whether those at risk of pulmonary hypertension (P=0.018) or patients with heart disease (P=0.043). Hydroxyurea-treated patients had higher apelin levels than untreated ones (P=0.001). Apelin was negatively correlated to lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, serum ferritin, end systolic diameter, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, right ventricle systolic pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and tissue Doppler imaging S wave. Apelin cutoff value of 1650ng/L could significantly detect the presence of cardiopulmonary complications in SCD with 90.9% sensitivity and 72.4% specificity.
Conclusion
Apelin is a promising marker for screening of SCD patients at risk of cardiopulmonary disease because it is altered during the early subclinical stage of cardiac affection. A combination of apelin and echocardiography provides a reliable method to assess cardiopulmonary affection in young SCD patients.

Abstract: Boron doped nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H quantum dot superlattice (QDSL) has a great potential to improve thin film silicon solar cells performance for high conductivity, wide band gap and anti-reflection effect. In this study p-type nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H QDSL has been fabricated by in situ grown method without subsequent annealing treatment. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and PL peak energy shift indicate that this method provides the possibility to precisely control the size of silicon quantum dots and the passivation at well/barrier interface. By optimizing structural characteristics and interface passivation, high perpendicular conductivity and strong anti-reflection effect was simultaneously obtained in QDSL films. An initial efficiency of 10.5% was achieved for n-i-p type hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell, which may guide further efforts arising the structure engineering of nc-Si:H/a-SiC:H QDSL for high efficient solar cells.

Based on the involvement of primary site of occurrence, DLBCL cases, were classified into different groups like, lymph node (60 cases, 28.98%), gastrointestinal tract (GI) (53 cases, 25.60%), Waldeyer's ring (WR) (31 cases, 14.97%), gland (25 cases, 12.08%), and other extranodal sites (38 cases, 18.36%). Patients with WR involvement were more frequently associated with early stage disease, favorable performance status, absence of bulky disease, normal LDH and ESR levels, and low- or low/intermediate-risk IPI than the other groups. The proportion of DLBCL patients with germinal center B cell (GCB) phenotype was 56.0% for WR, 46.5% for GI, 34.5% for lymph node, 27.8% for other extranodal sites, and 18.2% for gland (P=0.035). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the entire patient population was 71.1%, and WR group showed a better outcome than nodal group (84.9% vs. 55.9%, P=0.015). In multivariate analysis, bulky disease, bone marrow infiltration, non-GCB phenotype, intermediate/high- or high-risk IPI and SD/PD/Death after first therapy were identified as independent factors for poor OS, while regular application of rituximab and remission after first therapy were identified as favorable prognostic factors for PFS.
Conclusions
In this study, WR involvement was associated with more favorable clinical & pathological features along with better outcome than nodal lymphoma. The OS and PFS were largely dependent on other prognostic variables such as IPI or immunophenotype instead of the sites of involvement.

Abstract: Urocortins (UCNs) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) have been demonstrated to participate in various cardiovascular diseases, many of which involve vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) release is an important cause of VSMCs proliferation. The work was to investigate the regulation of VSMCs proliferation by UCN/TGF-beta and whether cPLA2 was a link between their signaling pathways. VSMCs proliferation was measured by colorimetric assay and immunofluorescence microscopy. Using cell flow cytometry, the changes in the cell cycle phases were investigated. Lentiviral Vector Particle was performed to overexpress cPLA2 gene. Both UCN and TGF-beta inhibited VSMCs proliferation and an additive effect was observed when the cells were treated with UCN plus TGF-beta. TGF-beta increased the percentage of cells in G1-phase while UCN increased the cell percentage in G2-phase with a concomitant decrease in S-phase. Furthermore, cPLA2 expression was increased by TGF-beta but decreased by UCN and UCN attenuated TGF-beta-induced cPLA2 expression. In primary VSMCs, TGF-beta induced cPLA2 phosphorylation, and this effect was also attenuated by UCN. Similar to UCN, the cPLA2 inhibitor, pyrrophenone (PYR), also played a role in enhancing TGF-beta-mediated mitoinhibition. Inversely, overexpression of cPLA2 eliminated the effect of UCN on the mitoinhibition. The pretreatment with UCN counteracted TGF-beta-mediated cPLA2 expression and activation, thereby contributing to TGF-beta-mediated mitoinhibition of VSMCs.

Abstract: An efficient electrocatalyst for Pt-free I−/I3− reduction has been synthesized by high temperature treatment of graphene oxide-cobalt phthalocyanine mixtures. The graphitic material was characterized by various techniques and was found to consist of reduced graphene oxide carrying CoN3 entities, obtained by thermal decomposition of cobalt phthalocyanine. This material had an ionization potential equal to 4.9±0.1eV and thus it was judged appropriate to act as reduction electrocatalyst for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. It was subsequently deposited as thin film on FTO electrodes, which were employed as counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells. Its capacity to reduce I−/I3− redox electrolyte was verified by electrochemistry. When it was finally employed for the construction of solar cells, it demonstrated full capacity to substitute standard Pt electrocatalyst verifying that the construction of Pt-free dye-sensitized solar cells is feasible.

Abstract: Background
Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic valve stenosis (AS). There is, however, little direct evidence for a role of active TGF-β1 in AS due to the sensitivity of current assays. We searched for evidence of plasma TGF-β1 activation by assaying Smad2/3 phosphorylation in circulating leukocytes and platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) in a mouse model of AS (Reversa).
Methods
Echocardiography was used to measure AS and cardiac function. Intracellular phospho-flow cytometry in combination with optical fluorescence microscopy was used to detect PLAs and p-Smad2/3 levels.
Results
Reversa mice on a western diet developed AS, had significantly increased numbers of PLAs and more intense staining for p-Smad2/3 in both PLAs and single leukocytes (all p<0.05). p-Smad2/3 staining was more intense in PLAs than in single leukocytes in both diet groups (p<0.05) and correlated with plasma total TGF-β1 levels (r=0.38, p=0.05 for PLAs and r=0.37, p=0.06 for single leukocytes) and reductions in ejection fraction (r=−0.42, p=0.03 for PLAs and r=−0.37, p=0.06 for single leukocytes).
Conclusions
p-Smad2/3 staining is more intense in leukocytes of hypercholesterolemic mice that developed AS, suggesting increased circulating active TGF-β1 levels. Leukocyte p-Smad2/3 may be a valuable surrogate indicator of circulating active TGF-β1.

Abstract: Several studies reported the benefits of switching from anticalcineurins to mTOR inhibitors to avoid cancer occurrence after organ transplantation. The purpose of our study was to determine in vivo biological markers to explain these benefits. Cellular changes related to cellular senescence and DNA damage were analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thirty-five kidney transplanted patients receiving anticalcineurins were investigated: 17 patients were proposed to switch to rapamycin and 18 patients with similar age and transplantation duration, continued anticalcineurins. Rapamycin effects were studied one year after the switch. Thirteen healthy volunteers and 18 hemodialyzed patients were evaluated as control. Compared with the healthy group, hemodialyzed and transplanted patients exhibited a significant decrease in telomere length, an increase in p16INK4A mRNA expression and in lymphocytes with 53BP1 foci. A destabilization of the shelterin complexes was suggested by a significant TIN2 mRNA decrease in transplanted patients compared with controls and a significant increase in TRF1, TRF2 and POT1 expression in switch-proposed patients compared with the non-switched subgroup. Rapamycin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in DNA damage and a slight TIN2 increase. In vitro experiments strengthened in vivo results showing that rapamycin but not FK506 induced a significant DNA damage decrease and TIN2 expression increase compared with controls. The roles of rapamycin in the decrease in DNA damage in vivo and the rescue of shelterin gene expression are demonstrated for the first time. These data provide new insights into understanding of how rapamycin may overcome genomic injuries.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to investigate the role of T follicular helper (TFH) cells in the immunopathogenesis of pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), as well as differences in TFH expansion and its regulation between newly diagnosed ITP (nITP) and chronic pediatric ITP (cITP).
Methods
Eighty-five children with ITP and 20 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled into this study. TFH cell frequencies and TFH cell-associated regulatory factors before and after treatment were analyzed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA.
Results
The percentages of TFH cells were significantly elevated in both nITP and cITP compared with controls. RT-PCR revealed significant differences in Bcl-6, c-Maf, Blimp-1, ICOSL, TACI and BAFFR mRNA expression in CD4+ T or CD19+ B cells between patients and controls, and further between nITP and cITP, before and after treatment. Moreover, there were significant differences in serum IL-4, IL-21 and BAFF between patients and controls.
Conclusion
The overactivation of TFH cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of pediatric ITP. IL-21 and IL-4 serum levels may affect the differentiation of TFH cells in ITP patients. The aberrant balance between BAFFR-BAFF/TACI-BAFF may be a factor that caused the persistent high expression of ICOSL in pediatric cITP, which consequently lead to the over activation of TFH cells in pediatric cITP.

Abstract: Acute and severe anemia of inflammation (AI) is a common complication of various clinical syndromes, including fulminant infections, critical illness with multiorgan failure, and exacerbations of autoimmune diseases. Building on recent data showing beneficial results with isocitrate treatment for chronic low-grade AI in a rat model, we used a mouse model of acute and severe AI induced by intraperitoneal heat-killed Brucella abortus to determine if isocitrate would be effective in this more stringent application. Inflamed mice treated with isocitrate developed an early but transient improvement in hemoglobin compared to solvent-treated controls, with a robust improvement on day 7, and only a trend towards improvement by day 14. Reticulocyte counts were increased in treated mice transiently, with no significant difference by day 21. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels were similar in treated versus control mice, indicating that isocitrate increased sensitivity to EPO. Serum and tissue iron levels showed no significant differences between the treated and control mice, ruling out improved iron availability as the cause of the increased response to endogenous EPO. Compared to the milder rat model, much higher doses of isocitrate were required for a relatively modest benefit.

Abstract: p97 (VCP) is a homo-hexameric triple-A ATPase that exerts a plethora of cellular processes. Heterozygous missense mutations of p97 cause at least five human neurodegenerative disorders. However, the specific molecular consequences of p97 mutations are hitherto widely unknown. Our in silico structural models of human and Dictyostelium p97 showed that the disease-causing human R93C, R155H, and R155C as well as Dictyostelium R154C, E219K, R154C/E219K p97 mutations constitute variations in surface-exposed locations. In-gel ATPase activity measurements of p97 monomers and hexamers revealed significant mutation- and species-specific differences. While all human p97 mutations led to an increase in ATPase activity, no changes could be detected for the Dictyostelium R154C mutant, which is orthologous to human R155C. The E219K mutation led to an almost complete loss of activity, which was partially recuperated in the R154C/E219K double-mutant indicating p97 inter-domain communication. By means of co-immunoprecipitation experiments we identified an UBX-domain containing Dictyostelium protein as a novel p97 interaction partner. We categorized all UBX-domain containing Dictyostelium proteins and named the interaction partner UBXD9. Pull-down assays and surface plasmon resonance analyses of Dictyostelium UBXD9 or the human orthologue TUG/ASPL/UBXD9 demonstrated direct interactions with p97 as well as species-, mutation- and ATP-dependent differences in the binding affinities. Sucrose density gradient assays revealed that both human and Dictyostelium UBXD9 proteins very efficiently disassembled wild-type, but to a lesser extent mutant p97 hexamers into monomers. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which p97 point mutations lead to differences in enzymatic activities and molecular interactions, which in the long-term result in a late-onset and progressive multisystem disease.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) are considered to be the most rapidly developed photovoltaic technology ever till date, portraying promising potential to replace the traditional silicon photovoltaics. In spite of such impressive growth, this technology is inundated with numerous challenges impeding the progress towards commercial viability. It is mainly due to the fact that the advancements in terms of performance efficiency were not equally matched with the fundamental understanding of inherent electronic and physio-chemical properties, modulating the photovoltaic parameters of the devices. Anomalous hysteresis observed in the current-voltage response of HPSCs is one of such major elusive issues prevalent in perovskite photovoltaics. Such hysteresis phenomenon could lead to erroneous estimation of the solar cell device efficiency, thereby its reliability during actual performance becomes questionable; serving as a serious obstacle for progress from both research as well as commercialization perspective. Hence, a detailed understanding of the origin of hysteresis and its associated mechanisms are highly indispensable. Though numerous theories have been proposed to elucidate the underlying causes of hysteresis, its origin is a highly debated topic till date and the most convincing answer is yet to be unraveled. The presented review takes an opportunity to elaborate various governing mechanisms or origins affecting the hysteresis phenomenon from a comprehensive yet insightful standpoint. This report also provides a concise synthesis of intricate interdependencies among the factors influencing hysteresis and highlights potential research strategies to develop hysteresis-free devices; rendering possible pathways to facilitate the viable commercialization of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Lead halide complexes are efficient precursors to obtain high quality perovskite films and high performance solar cells. However, how the lead halide complex affects the crystallization kinetics and thus the film quality of perovskite has not been systematically studied. Herein, two PbI2(X) complexes with different coordination strength of ligand X in complexation with PbI2 (PbI2(DMF) and PbI2(DMSO)) are synthesized. The correlation between the morphology, evolution of the perovskite formation, defects state, carrier lifetime and the subsequent photovoltaic performance are investigated in details via a two-step coating method with various PbI2(X) complexes. We find that PbI2(DMSO) derived perovskite film shows larger grains and vertically oriented grain boundaries as well as enhanced photoluminescence intensity and longer carrier lifetime. As a result, highly efficient inverted planar perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency up to 17.0% are achieved from PbI2(DMSO) complex under 1 sun illumination. This research could open up a new pathway to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells through the control of perovskite crystallization kinetics by choosing proper PbI2(X) complex precursors.

Abstract: Objective
This was a retrospective data analysis to evaluate the treatment response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with Velaglucerase alfa using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Materials and methods
A baseline and follow-up MRI were performed on 18 Gaucher Type 1 patients at an interval of 11.6 months. The MRI score systems determined the Bone-Marrow-Burden (BMB) score, the Düsseldorf-Gaucher score (DGS), and the Vertebra-Disc-Ratio (VDR). The Severity Score Index Type 1 (GD-DS3) was also assessed.
Results
The baseline MRI medians were: BMB, 7.00; DGS, 3.00; and VDR: 1.70; while, the follow-up MRI medians were: BMB, 7.00; DGS, 3.00; and VDR: 1.73. The baseline GD-DS3 median was 2.40 (BMB excl.: 0.50) and the follow-up median was 2.00 (BMB excl.: 0.50). There was weak statistical significance with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the DGS (p=0.034) and GD-DS3 (p=0.047) between both MRIs.
Conclusion
Velaglucerase alfa therapy is a effective long-term treatment for Gaucher Type 1 patients who are newly diagnosed or switching therapies. Measurements with whole-body MRI and an objective scoring system were reliable tools for detecting early stage bone marrow activity. Further research is needed to evaluate the "Booster-Effect" of Velaglucerase alfa therapy in Gaucher skeletal disease.

Abstract: CD4+Foxp3− type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are potent producers of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), through which they suppress pathogenic inflammation and autoimmune responses. The role of Tr1 response in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is still unclear. Here, we examined the frequency, phenotype, induction mechanism, and function of Tr1 cells in GBM patients. Compared to healthy controls, GBM patients presented significantly higher frequency of Tr1 cells in peripheral blood. The Tr1 frequency was further elevated in the tumor. By surface marker expression, the Tr1 cells were enriched in the antigen-experienced effector/memory cell compartment. A minority of Tr1 cells presented IL-10+TGF-β+ double expression. Interestingly, naive CD4+CD45RA+ T cells could differentiate into IL-10- and TGF-β-expressing cells, if incubated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or with macrophages conditioned with primary glioma cells, suggesting that tumor cells and TAMs had a role in inducing Tr1 cells in GBM patients. Coculture of Tr1 cells with proinflammatory CD4+ T cells resulted in TGF-β-dependent reduction of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-10-dependent reduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), while coculture of Tr1 cells with CD8+ T cells resulted in lower tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Together, these results demonstrated an upregulation of Tr1 cells in GBM with anti-inflammatory functions.

Abstract: Sorption method of Thermal Energy Storage (STES) is a promising technology towards efficient use of solar energy. Materials based on hygroscopic salts and their hydrates have a high potential for STES in term of energy storage density. This work addresses the novel composite sorbents based on Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) impregnated with three hygroscopic salts selected for STES. The paper consists of three parts: (1) analysis of operating conditions of two selected STES cycles, namely long-term (seasonal) heat storage for the regions with moderate cold climate (LT), and short-term (daily) heat storage in winter for areas with relatively warm climate (ST); (2) preparation of the Salt/MWCNT composites (salt=CaCl2, LiCl, and LiBr) adapted to these cycles, and study of water and methanol sorption on these materials; and (3) evaluation of heat storage capacity of the new sorbents and feasibility of the selected STES cycles. The results obtained show that the working pair “LiCl/MWCNT – methanol” appears to be the most advantageous for the LT cycle, while “LiCl/MWCNT – water” is the best for the ST cycle. The heat storage capacity of LiCl/MWCNT under conditions of the considered cycles reaches 1.6 and 1.7kJ/g (or 445 and 470 Wh/kg) with methanol and water, respectively, and exceeds the appropriate values for common and innovative adsorbents suggested for STES. This demonstrates the great potential of the new composites for STES and promotes the broader implementation of this emerging technology.

Abstract: In modern times for combating the deleterious soil microbes for improved sustainable agricultural practices, there is a need to have a proper understanding of the plant-microbe interactions present in the rhizospheric microbiome of the plant roots. In the present study, the interactions of trichodermin with petidyltransferase centre of ribosomal complex was studied by molecular dynamics and in silico interaction methods to demonstrate its mechanism of action and to decipher the possible reason how it may inhibit protein synthesis at the ribosomal complex. Further we have illustrated how trichodermin resistance protein (60S ribosomal protein L3) helps to overcome the deleterious effects of trichothecene compounds like trichodermin. Normal mode analysis of trichodermin resistance protein and 25S rRNA that constitutes the petidyltransferase centre showed that the W-finger region of the protein moved towards 25S rRNA. Further analysis of molecular dynamics simulation time frames showed that several intermediate states of large motions of the protein molecules towards the 25S rRNA which finally blocks the binding pocket of the trichodermin. It indicated that this protein not only changes the local environment and conformation of the petidyltransferase centre but also restrain trichodermin from binding to the 25S rRNA at the petidyltransferase centre.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) is a potential source for cell therapy due to its property to promote tissue repair. Although, it has been known that hMSCs promote tissue repair via angiogenic cytokines, the interaction between hMSC-derived cytokines and the endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which play an important role in tissue neovascularization, is poorly characterized. We investigate the effect of cytokine released from different sources of hMSCs including bone marrow and gestational tissues on the EPC functions in vitro. The migration, extracellular matrix invasion and vessel formation of EPCs were studied in the presence or absence of cytokines released from various sources of hMSCs using transwell culture system. The migration of EPCs was highest when co-culture with secretory factors from placenta-derived hMSCs (PL-hMSCs) compared to those co-culture with other sources of hMSCs. For invasion and vessel formation, secretory factors from bone marrow-derived hMSCs (BM-hMSCs) could produce the maximal enhancement compared to other sources. We further identified the secreted cytokines and found that the migratory-enhancing cytokine from PL-hMSCs was PDGF-BB while the enhancing cytokine from BM-hMSCs on invasion was IGF-1. For vessel formation, the cytokines released from BM-hMSCs were IGF1 and SDF-1. In conclusion, hMSCs can release angiogenic cytokines which increase the migration, invasion and vessel forming capacity of EPCs. We can then use hMSCs as a source of angiogenic cytokines to induce neovascularization in injured/ischemic tissues.

Abstract: Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are involved in innate immune responses and signaling cross-talk between these receptor molecules has the potential to augment an ongoing inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible cooperative influence of PAR-2 and TLR4 on IL-12p40 production by macrophages after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). During culture, GM-CSF upregulated PAR-2 expression by macrophages in a time-dependent manner. Stimulation with LPS enhanced IL-12p40 production by macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. While human neutrophil elastase (HNE) did not induce IL-12p40 production, pretreatment of macrophages with HNE synergistically increased the IL-12p40 protein level after LPS exposure. Silencing of TLR4 with small interfering RNA blunted the synergistic enhancement of IL-12p40 by HNE combined with LPS. Silencing of β-arrestin 2, p22phox, or ERK1/2 also inhibited an increase of IL-12p40. Interestingly, transfection of macrophages with small interfering RNA duplexes for DUOX-2, EGFR, TLR4, or TRAF6 significantly blunted the increase of IL-12p40 in response to treatment with HNE plus LPS. U73122 and Rottlerin also inhibited the increased production of IL-12p40. In conclusion, HNE is involved in transactivation of TLR4 through activation of DUOX-2/EGFR and synergistically enhances IL-12p40 production by macrophages stimulated with LPS.

Abstract: To decipher the function(s) of HYPK, a huntingtin (HTT)-interacting protein with chaperone-like activity, we had previously identified 36 novel interacting partners of HYPK. Another 13 proteins were known earlier to be associated with HYPK. On the basis of analysis of the interacting partners of HYPK, it has been shown that HYPK may participate in diverse cellular functions relevant to Huntington’s disease. In the present study, we identified additional 5 proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization. As of now we have 54 primary interactors of HYPK. From the database we collected 1026 unique proteins (secondary interactors) interacting with these 54 primary HYPK interacting partners. We observed that 10 primary and 91 secondary interacting proteins of HYPK are associated with two types of autophagy processes. We next tested the hypothesis that the hub, HYPK, might itself be involved in autophagy. Using mouse striatal STHdhQ7/HdhQ7 cell lines, we observed that over expression of HYPK significantly increased background cellular autophagy, while knock down of endogenous HYPK decreased the autophagy level as detected by altered LC3I conversion, BECN1 expression, cleavage of GFP from LC3-GFP, ATG5-ATG12 conjugate formation and expression of transcription factors like Tfeb, Srebp2 and Zkscan3. This result shows that HYPK, possibly with its interacting partners, induces autophagy. We further observed that N-terminal mutant HTT reduced the cellular levels of LC3II and BECN1, which could be recovered significantly upon over expression of HYPK in these cells. This result further confirms that HYPK could also be involved in clearing mutant HTT aggregates by augmenting autophagy pathway.

Abstract: Background
Recent studies show that Liver X receptors (LXR) activation is involved in the regulation of tumor cell death in solid cancer via E2 factor (E2F) transcription factor or suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) pathway. However, the effect of LXR activation on leukemic cell fate has not been tested.
Methods
Two human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, Jurkat and SupT1, were cultured. Cells were transfected with small-interfering RNA (si-RNA) against SOCS3 and E2F family members (including E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3a) followed by treatment with LXR activator GW3965. The cellular biological behaviors, including proliferation, colony-forming ability and apoptosis were tested afterward.
Results
Activation of LXR by GW3965 significantly decreased the cell proliferation rates and colony-forming abilities in the Jurkat and SupT1 cells, but increased their apoptosis rates. Western blot assay show that GW3965 treatment dramatically up-regulated the SOCS3 protein in both cell lines, without affecting E2F1, E2F2 and F2F3a expression levels. SOCS3 inhibition by si-RNA transfection, instead of E2F1, E2F2 and F2F3a pathway inhibition, abolished the aforementioned effects of LXR activation on Jurkat and SupT1 cells.
Conclusion
Our finding suggests that LXR activation regulates leukemic cell fate and biological behavior via SOCS3 pathway, rather than E2F family members.

Abstract: Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) has been shown to be associated with glucose-induced deterioration of pancreatic beta cell function in diabetes. However, whether epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the regulation of TXNIP gene expression by glucose is not clear. Here we studied how glucose exerts its effect on TXNIP gene expression via modulation of histone acetylation marks. To achieve this, we applied clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock out histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 in a rat pancreatic beta cell line INS1 832/13. We also treated the cells and human islets with chemical inhibitors of HAT p300 and histone deacetylase (HDAC). In human islets, diabetes and high glucose resulted in elevated TXNIP and EP300 expression, and glucose-induced TXNIP expression could be reversed by p300 inhibitor C646. In INS1 832/13 cells, Ep300 knock-out by CRISPR/Cas9 elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion and greatly reduced glucose-stimulated Txnip expression and cell apoptosis. This effect could be ascribed to decrease in histone marks H3K9ac and H4ac at the promoter and first coding region of the Txnip gene. Histone marks H3K9ac and H4ac in the Txnip gene in the wild-type cells was inhibited by HDAC inhibitor at high glucose, which most likely was due to enhanced acetylation levels of p300 after HDAC inhibition; and thereby reduced p300 binding to the Txnip gene promoter region. Such inhibition was absent in the Ep300 knock-out cells. Our study provides evidence that histone acetylation serves as a key regulator of glucose-induced increase in TXNIP gene expression and thereby glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Tanshinone IIA (TanIIA) is a traditional Chinese agent and has been widely used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Our previous study has shown that TanIIA can induce the differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells by increasing C/EBPβexpression and induce APL cell apoptosis in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the activity of TanIIA against APL in vivo. We found that treatment with TanIIA prevented APL-mediated reduction in body weights. Treatment with TanIIA inhibited the proliferation of APL cells and triggered APL cell apoptosis and differentiation in vivo. Treatment with TanIIA significantly prolonged the survival of APL-bearing mice. Our data indicate that TanIIA has potent anti-APL activity with little adverse effect.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 (CZTSSe) thin films are considered as a viable source for the future electricity generation using solar energy. In this report, CZTSSe thin films were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique as a function of laser pulse repetition rate onto the Mo coated glass substrates. Structural, surface morphological, optical and electrical properties of CZTSSe thin films have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The XRD and Raman analysis confirmed the phase pure polycrystalline structure of thin films of CZTSSe synthesized at high pulse repetition rate. Moreover, the presence of the XRD peak at 27.72° corresponding to (112) plane reveals the tetragonal structure of CZTSSe. The band gap energy of synthesized CZTSSe thin films is found around 1.20eV which is optimum for the solar energy harvesting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the deposition of CZTSSe via PLD technique by using different pulse repetition rate.

Abstract: We use a calibrated realistic 2D device simulation structure of a single cell from a monolithic interconnected Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 solar module to investigate the impact of modifications of the patterning laser scribe P1 and the trench properties on the energy yield. This particularly includes examining the change of the low light behaviour and the performance ratio (PR). In order to study the effects of the P1 characteristics, we performed a variation of the P1 width, the absorber doping concentration within the P1 trench as well as a variation of the Mo(Se,S)2 band gap and the doping concentration. We simulated temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics for different irradiances and apply the weather data of three different locations to calculate the PRs. An increased P1 width and decreased absorber doping concentration was found to increase the P1 (parallel) shunt resistance due to a reduced horizontal hole current component between the separated back electrodes. A higher shunt resistance enhances the low light behaviour of the solar cell and consequently leads to an improvement of the PR. A decreased Mo(Se,S)2 band gap and doping concentration increases the valence band barrier at the Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2/Mo(Se,S)2 interface and we obtained a moderate P1 shunt improvement accompanied by a strong PR enhancement. The increased barrier height enhanced the low light and temperature behaviour of the fill factor finally leading to the PR enhancement.

Abstract: Three novel conjugated polymers incorporating extended DADAD and DADADAD building blocks with the 5,6-bisalkoxybenzoxadiazole acceptor (A) and the electron donor (D) thiophene units were synthesized and fully characterized. The application of the benzoxadiazole instead of benzothiadiazole resulted in a significant increase in the open circuit voltage of organic solar cells based on such polymers. The best performing material delivered a decent solar light power conversion efficiency of 5.5% in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells using PC71BM as an electron acceptor component. The obtained results revealed a high potential of using different acceptor building blocks in the design of novel (-X-DADAD-)n polymers with tailored optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.

Abstract: Efficacy and safety of iron chelation therapy with deferasirox in iron-overloaded non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) patients were established in the THALASSA study. THETIS, an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, Phase IV study, added to this evidence by investigating earlier dose escalation by baseline liver iron concentration (LIC) (week 4: escalation according to baseline LIC; week 24: adjustment according to LIC response, maximum 30mg/kg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in LIC from baseline to week 52. 134 iron-overloaded non-transfusion-dependent anaemia patients were enrolled and received deferasirox starting at 10mg/kg/day. Mean actual dose±SD over 1year was 14.70±5.48mg/kg/day. At week 52, mean LIC±SD decreased significantly from 15.13±10.72mg Fe/g dw at baseline to 8.46±6.25mg Fe/g dw (absolute change from baseline, −6.68±7.02mg Fe/g dw [95% CI: −7.91, −5.45]; P<0.0001). Most common drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal: abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and nausea (n=6 each). There was one death (pneumonia, not considered drug related). With significant and clinically relevant reductions in iron burden alongside a safety profile similar to that in THALASSA, these data support earlier escalation with higher deferasirox doses in iron-overloaded non-transfusion-dependent anaemia patients.

Diabetes impairs heart mitochondrial function without changes in resting cardiac performance,

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease associated to a cardiac contractile dysfunction that is not attributable to underlying coronary artery disease or hypertension, and could be consequence of a progressive deterioration of mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that impaired mitochondrial function precedes Diabetic Cardiomyopathy. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the cardiac performance and heart mitochondrial function of diabetic rats, using an experimental model of type I Diabetes. Rats were sacrificed after 28days of Streptozotocin injection (STZ, 60mgkg−1, ip.). Heart O2 consumption was declined, mainly due to the impairment of mitochondrial O2 uptake. The mitochondrial dysfunction observed in diabetic animals included the reduction of state 3 respiration (22%), the decline of ADP/O ratio (∼15%) and the decrease of the respiratory complexes activities (22–26%). An enhancement in mitochondrial H2O2 (127%) and NO (23%) production rates and in tyrosine nitration (58%) were observed in heart of diabetic rats, with a decrease in Mn-SOD activity (∼50%). Moreover, a decrease in contractile response (38%), inotropic (37%) and lusitropic (58%) reserves were observed in diabetic rats only after a β‐adrenergic stimulus. Therefore, in conditions of sustained hyperglycemia, heart mitochondrial O2 consumption and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency are decreased, and H2O2 and NO productions are increased, leading to a cardiac compromise against a work overload. This mitochondrial impairment was detected in the absence of heart hypertrophy and of resting cardiac performance changes, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction could precede the onset of diabetic cardiac failure, being H2O2, NO and ATP the molecules probably involved in mitochondrion-cytosol signalling.

Abstract: Oxygenated cadmium sulfide (CdS:O) produced by reactive sputtering has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional CdS for use as the n-type window layer in CdTe solar cells. Here, complementary techniques are used to expose the window layer (CdS or CdS:O) in completed superstrate devices and combined with a suite of materials characterization to elucidate its evolution during high temperature device processing. During device fabrication amorphous CdS:O undergoes significant interdiffusion with CdTe and recrystallization, forming CdS1−yTey nanocrystals whose Te fraction approaches solubility limits. Significant oxygen remains after processing, concentrated in sulfate clusters dispersed among the CdS1−yTey alloy phase, accounting for ~30% of the post-processed window layer based on cross-sectional microscopy. Interdiffusion and recrystallization are observed in devices with un-oxygenated CdS, but to a much lesser extent. Etching experiments suggest that the CdS thickness is minimally changed during processing, but the CdS:O window layer is reduced from 100nm to 60–80nm, which is confirmed by microscopy. Alloying reduces the band gap of the CdS:O window layer to 2.15eV, but reductions in thickness and areal density improve its transmission spectrum, which is well matched to device quantum efficiency. The changes to the window layer in the reactive environments of device fabrication are profoundly different than what occurs by thermal annealing in an inert environment, which produced films with a band gap of 2.4eV for both CdS and CdS:O. These results illustrate for the first time the significant changes that occur to the window layer during processing that are critical to the performance of CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Thermochromic vanadium dioxide thin films were deposited from the electric field assisted atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition reaction of vanadyl acetylacetonate and 2%O2/98%N2 at temperatures between 350 and 530°C on to fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass substrates. A potential difference was applied between the top plate and substrate during the deposition to generate an electric field with a positive bias applied to the substrate. The films produced were analysed and characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy Raman spectroscopy, contact angle and variable temperature UV/Visible spectroscopy. It was found that the presence of an electric field during deposition could lead to a marked change in the microstructure particularly a reduced crystallite size and a reduced thermochromic transition temperature. The optical data collected in this study is used in building energy demand simulation to predict the potential energy savings achievable by using these novel thin films compared to standard industrial products, for locations with different climates. The results suggest that such glazing can have a significant energy saving effect compared to current approaches across a wide range of climate types.

Abstract: With the combination of immunophenotyping and molecular tests, it is still a challenge to identify the characteristics of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated with distinct outcomes. This study tests the possible correlation of cellular expression of CD135 and CD117 with somatic gene mutations in T-ALL. One hundred sixty-two samples were tested, including 143 at diagnosis, 15 from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma at relapse, and four relapse samples from sequential follow-up of T-ALL. CD135 and CD117 monoclonal antibodies were included in the T-ALL panel of flow cytometry. The percentage of cells positivity and the median fluorescence intensity were correlated with gene mutational status. STIL-TAL1, TLX3, FLT3 and IL7R mutations were tested using standard techniques. STIL-TAL1 was found in 24.8%, TLX3 in 12%, IL7R in 10% and FLT3-ITD in 5% of cases. FLT3 and IL7R mutations were mutually exclusive, as were FLT3-ITD and STIL-TAL1. Associations of CD135high (p<0.01), CD117intermediate/high (p=0.02) and FLT3-ITD, CD117low with IL7Rmutated (p<0.01) and CD135high with TLX3pos were observed. We conclude that the addition of CD135 and CD117 to the diagnosis can predict molecular aberrations in T-ALL settings, mainly segregating patients with FLT3-ITD, who would benefit from treatment with inhibitors of tyrosine.

Abstract: Cell migrations are diverse. They constitutemajor morphogenetic driving forces during embryogenesis, but they contribute also to the loss of tissue homeostasis and cancer growth. Capabilities of cells to migrate as single cells or as collectives are controlled by internal and external signalling, leading to the reorganisation of their cytoskeleton as well as by the rebalancing of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions. Among the genes altered in numerous cancers, cadherins and growth factor receptors are of particular interest for cell migration regulation. In particular, cadherins such as N-cadherin and a class of growth factor receptors, namely FGFRs cooperate to regulate embryonic and cancer cell behaviours. In this review, we discuss on reciprocal crosstalk between N-cadherin and FGFRs during cell migration. Finally, we aim at clarifying the synergy between N-cadherin and FGFR signalling that ensure cellular reorganization during cell movements, mainly during cancer cell migration and metastasis but also during developmental processes.

Abstract: Vascular resistance and tissue perfusion may be both affected by impaired vascular function and increased blood viscosity. Little is known about the effects of vascular function on the occurrence of painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). The aim of the present study was to determine which side of the balance (blood viscosity or vascular function) is the most deleterious in SCA and increases the risk for frequent hospitalized VOC. Microvascular function, microcirculatory oxygenation and blood viscosity were determined in a group of 22 SCA children/adolescents at steady state and a group of 13 healthy children/adolescents. Univariate analyses demonstrated blunted microvascular reactivity during local thermal heating test and decreased microcirculatory oxygenation in SCA children compared to controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased blood viscosity and decreased microcirculatory oxygenation were independent risk factors of frequent VOC in SCA. In contrast, the level of microvascular dysfunction does not predict VOC rate. In conclusion, increased blood viscosity is usually well supported in healthy individuals where vascular function is not impaired. However, in the context of SCA, microvascular function is impaired and any increase of blood viscosity or decrease in microcirculatory oxygenation would increase the risks for frequent VOC.

Abstract: Background
β-Thalassemia major (BTM) is considered the most common hemoglobinopathy in Egypt and is one of the major health problems in our locality.
Materials & methods
We investigated the frequency of B-regulatory cells (CD19+CD38hiCD24hi); (Bregs) among polytransfused alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized children with BTM. The study included 110 polytransfused pediatric patients with β-thalassemia major. Clinical and transfusion records of all studied patients were reviewed. Indirect antiglobulin test was performed to detect the presence of alloantibodies. We used flow cytometry for detection of CD19+CD38hiCD24hi regulatory B cells.
Results
Alloimmunization was detected in 35.5% of thalassemic patients (39/110). The analysis of our data showed a significantly higher frequency of Bregs (CD19+CD38hiCD24hi) in the peripheral blood of both alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized patients as compared to healthy controls.
Conclusions
Our data showed that the frequencies of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs cells were significantly increased in children with BTM. Our data suggested that Bregs cells could play a role in the clinical course of BTM. The relationship of Bregs to immune disorders in BTM children remains to be determined. Further longitudinal study with a larger sample size is warranted to explore the mechanisms of Breg cells in the disease process in BTM patients.

Abstract: Inherited red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and hereditary ovalocytosis, result from mutations in genes encoding various RBC membrane and skeletal proteins. The RBC membrane, a composite structure composed of a lipid bilayer linked to a spectrin/actin-based membrane skeleton, confers upon the RBC unique features of deformability and mechanical stability. The disease severity is primarily dependent on the extent of membrane surface area loss. RBC membrane disorders can be readily diagnosed by various laboratory approaches that include RBC cytology, flow cytometry, ektacytometry, electrophoresis of RBC membrane proteins and genetics. The reference technique for diagnosis of RBC membrane disorders is the osmotic gradient ektacytometry. However, in spite of its recognition as the reference technique, this technique is rarely used as a routine diagnosis tool for RBC membrane disorders due to its limited availability. This may soon change as a new generation of ektacytometer has been recently engineered. In this review, we describe the workflow of the samples shipped to our Hematology laboratory for RBC membrane disorder analysis and the data obtained for a large cohort of French patients presenting with RBC membrane disorders using a newly available version of the ektacytomer.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma is the second-most common solid tumor in children and originates from poorly differentiated neural crest-derived progenitors. Although most advanced stage metastatic neuroblastoma patients initially respond to treatment, a therapy resistant pool of poorly differentiated cells frequently arises, leading to refractory disease. A lack of insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuroblastoma progression hampers the development of effective new therapies for these patients. Normal neural crest development and maturation is guided by physical interactions between the cell and its surroundings, in addition to soluble factors such as growth factors. This mechanical crosstalk is mediated by actin-based adhesion structures and cell protrusions that probe the cellular environment to modulate migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Whereas such signals preserve cellular quiescence in non-malignant cells, perturbed adhesion signaling promotes de-differentiation, uncontrolled cell proliferation, tissue invasion and therapy resistance. We previously reported that high expression levels of the channel-kinase TRPM7, a protein that maintains the progenitor state of embryonic neural crest cells, are closely associated with progenitor-like features of tumor cells, accompanied by extensive cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesion remodeling. To define mechanisms by which TRPM7 may contribute to neuroblastoma progression, we applied a proteomics approach to identify TRPM7 interacting proteins. We show that TRPM7 is part of a large complex of proteins, many of which function in cytoskeletal organization, cell protrusion formation and adhesion dynamics. Expression of a subset of these TRPM7 interacting proteins strongly correlates with neuroblastoma progression in independent neuroblastoma patient datasets. Thus, TRPM7 is part of a large cytoskeletal complex that may affect the malignant potential of tumor cells by regulating actomyosin dynamics and cell-matrix interactions.

Abstract: Caveolins (Cav-1, -2 and -3) and Cavins (Cavin-1, -2, -3 and -4) are two protein families controlling the biogenesis and function of caveolae, plasma membrane omega-like invaginations representing the primary site of important cellular processes like endocytosis, cholesterol homeostasis and signal transduction. Caveolae are especially abundant in fat tissue, playing a consistent role in a number of processes, such as the insulin-dependent glucose uptake and transmembrane transport of lipids underlying differentiation, maintenance and adaptive hypertrophy of adipocytes. Based on this premise, in this work we have investigated the expression of caveolar protein components in liposarcoma (LPS), an adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma affecting adults categorized in well-differentiated, dedifferentiated, myxoid and pleomorphic histotypes. By performing an extensive microarray data analysis followed by immunohistochemistry on human LPS tumors, we demonstrated that Cav-1, Cav-2 and Cavin-1 always cluster in all the histotypes, reaching the highest expression in well-differentiated LPS, the least aggressive of the malignant forms composed by tumor cells with a morphology resembling mature adipocytes. In vitro experiments carried out using two human LPS cell lines showed that the expression levels of Cav-1, Cav-2 and Cavin-1 proteins were faintly detectable during cell growth, becoming consistently increased during the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets characterizing the adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, in differentiated LPS cells the three proteins were also found to co-localize and form molecular aggregates at the plasma membrane, as shown via immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis. Overall, these data indicate that Cav-1, Cav-2 and Cavin-1 may be considered as reliable markers for identification of LPS tumors characterized by consistent adipogenic differentiation.

Abstract: A-π-D-π-A type conjugated small molecules (COOP-nHT-BDT (n=1–4)) with a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donating core, 2-cyano-3-octyloxy-3-oxo-1-propenyl (COOP) as the terminal electron-accepting unit, and two regioregular oligo(3-hexylthiophene) (nHT) as π-conjugated bridges were synthesized and characterized. TGA results confirmed that all these compounds are thermally stable with decomposition temperatures higher than 340°C. Broad absorption bands over 350 to 600nm with small optical band gaps (Egopt) of 1.9–1.8eV were measured for these compounds. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that HOMO energy level of these COOP-nHT-BDTs increases slightly with the increase of nHT chain length, whereas all these compounds display similar LUMO energy level of −3.60eV. These were supported by density function calculation results, that electronic wave functions of the HOMO orbitals are delocalized over the BDT-core with the adjacent 2–3 thiophene units, whereas the electronic wave functions of the LUMO orbital are mostly localized on the terminal COOP unit with 1–2 thiophene units. Gradually increasing of the photovoltaic performance was found for these compounds with the increase of the π-bridge chain length, and the COOP-4HT-BDT/PC71BM (2:1, w/w) based device displayed a best power conversion efficiency of 5.14% with an open circuit voltage of 0.90V, a short circuit current of 8.27mAcm−2and a fill factor of 0.69. A positive correlation between long-term stability of PCE and chain length was also obtained. COOP-4HT-BDT based devices showed the highest device stability with only 15% decay after 320h continuous illumination.

Abstract: Cell transplantation is a promising strategy in regenerative medicine. Beneficial effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on heart disease have been widely reported. However, the MSCs in these studies have been mainly derived from autologous animals, and data on MSCs from human umbilical cord blood (UCB-MSCs) are still scarce. We investigated whether intramyocardial xenogeneic administration of UCB-MSCs is beneficial for preserving heart function in a cTnTR141W transgenic mouse of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cultured UCB-MSCs, which were identified by there morphology, differentiation and cell surface markers, were transplanted into cTnTR141W transgenic mice to examine apoptosis, fibrosis, vasculogenesis and the associated Akt pathway. Moreover, we measured the expression levels of VEGF and IGF-1, which are growth factors required for differentiation into cardiomyocytes, and are also involved in cardiac regeneration and improving heart function. One month after transplantation, MSCs significantly decreased chamber dilation and contractile dysfunction in the cTnTR141W mice. MSCs transplanted hearts showed a significant decrease in cardiac apoptosis and its regulation by the Akt pathway. Cardiac fibrosis and cytoplasmic vacuolisation were significantly attenuated in the MSCs group. Importantly, the levels of VEGF and IGF-1 were increased in the MSCs transplanted hearts. In vitro, the MSC-conditioned medium displayed anti-apoptotic activity in h9c2 cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia. These results further confirm the paracrine effects of MSCs. In conclusion, UCB-MSCs preserve cardiac function after intramyocardial transplantation in a DCM mouse, and this effect may be associated with reductions in cellular apoptosis, inflammation, hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis; in addition to; up-regulation of Akt, VEGF and IGF-1; and enhanced angiogenesis.

Abstract: Light induced degradation can cause a severe loss of efficiency on multi-crystalline PERC solar cells (mc-LID) of more than 10%rel. In this work, the kinetics of the mc-LID annealing process and its temperature dependence is analyzed. It is shown that the initial efficiency can be partly restored by annealing the cell in the dark. However, the degradation process is not completely reversible and the degradation rates of the first and subsequent degradation cycles are different. Furthermore, lateral variations of the degradation are investigated. Four regions showing a quantitatively different degradation behavior are identified. Mc-LID of the rear contacts shows similar degradation as for standard back surface field solar cells. The degradation of grain boundaries is weaker than intra-grain degradation and thus of particular interest for root cause analysis. Decorated grain boundaries are dominated by other recombination mechanisms suppressing the appearance of mc-LID. Physical explanations for these results of a laterally different degradation behavior and an increased degradation rate after annealing are discussed.

Abstract: The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis response to chemotherapy is still a subject of intense debate in recent years. More efforts have focused on the regulation effects of apoptosis on autophagy, whereas how autophagy affects apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study performed on prostate cancer cells, we investigated the role of autophagy in adriamycin-induced apoptosis, as well as the mechanisms mediating the effects of autophagy on apoptosis response to adriamycin (ADM). The results show that ADM not only inhibited cell viability and enhanced apoptosis, but also promoted autophagy via PI3K/Akt(T308)/mTOR signal pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by either pharmacological inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or RNA interference of Atg5 increased ADM-induced apoptosis and enhanced the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, blockade of autophagy augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by ADM. Scavenging of ROS by antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reversed the strengthened effects of CQ on ADM-induced apoptosis and rescued the cells from apoptosis. The results identified ROS as a potential mediator directing the modulation effects of the protective autophagy on apoptosis response to ADM. Suppression of the protective autophagy might provide a promising strategy to increase the anticancer efficacy of agents in the treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: A genome-wide association study was performed on 1130 premenopausal women to detect common variants associated with three serum iron-related phenotypes. Total iron binding capacity was strongly associated (p=10−14) with variants in and near the TF gene (transferrin), the serum iron transporting protein, and with variants in HFE (p=4×10−7), which encodes the human hemochromatosis gene. Association was also detected between percent iron saturation (p=10−8) and variants in the chromosome 6 region containing both HFE and SLC17A2, which encodes a phosphate transport protein. No significant associations were detected with serum iron, but variants in HFE were suggestive (p=10−6). Our results corroborate prior studies in older subjects and demonstrate that the association of these genetic variants with iron phenotypes can be detected in premenopausal women.

Abstract: By means of immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation experiments, we here demonstrate mitochondrial distribution of LIN7 and IRSp53 in HeLa cells. These peripheral proteins displayed a tight association with mitochondria and coimmunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fractions. In line with a role for LIN7 in the regulation of IRSp53 activity on actin dynamics, the morphology of mitochondria was similarly altered by changing the expression levels of either each protein or both, whereas mitochondrial morphology was preserved in cells overexpressing IRSp53 deleted of its binding domains for LIN7 (IRSp53Δ5) or for actin polymerisation modulators (IRSp53ΔSH3). In particular, the overexpression of full length LIN7 and/or IRSp53 increased the percentage of cells with short mitochondria, while downregulation of the endogenous proteins by shRNAs increased the amount of cells with elongated and perinuclear clustered mitochondria. These mitochondria were only partially resistant to fragmentation induced by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (i.e. treatment with sodium azide), whereas mitochondria were fully protected by the fission defective mutant Drp1 K38A. Overexpression of LIN7 or IRSp53 did not prevent the formation of hyperfused mitochondria in cells coexpressing the Drp1 K38A mutant, thus suggesting that LIN7-IRSp53 complex requires functional Drp1 to regulate mitochondrial morphology.

Abstract: This study describes in detail the effects of sodium and potassium on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers and solar cells. We report on the influence of these species on the surface and bulk composition as well as bulk defect structure of CIGS films as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and photoluminescence (PL). From the XPS studies it is found that Na and K promote oxygen absorption onto the CIGS films. Furthermore, potassium accelerates the formation of indium and gallium oxides on the film surface, making the surface Cu-deficient. Low temperature PL studies suggest that (i) Na and K help passivate non-radiative recombination centers, presumably at the grain boundaries, and (ii) Na further impacts the bulk defect structure inside of CIGS grains, which is not observed with K. This change in bulk defect structure is attributed to the greater diffusivity of Na in CIGS relative to K due to the smaller atomic size. This in-depth study (integration of XPS, SIMS, PL, and device characteristics) reveals that the surface chemistry and the grain boundary passivation have stronger influences on the device performance than the bulk defect structure.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) of variable severity in individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in GPI gene. This work presents clinical features and genotypic results of two patients of Portuguese origin with GPI deficiency. The patients suffer from a mild hemolytic anemia (Hb levels ranging from 10 to 12.7g/mL) associated with macrocytosis, reticulocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperferritinemia and slight splenomegaly. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed in one patient homozygosity for a new missense mutation in exon 3, c.260G>C (p.Gly87Ala), and in the second patient compound heterozygosity for the same missense mutation (p.Gly87Ala), along with a frameshift mutation resulting from a single nucleotide deletion in exon 14, c.1238delA (p.Gln413Arg fs*24). Mutation p.Gln413Arg fs*24 is the first frameshift null mutation to be described in GPI deficiency. Molecular modeling suggests that the structural change induced by the p.Gly87Ala pathogenic variant has direct impact in the structural arrangement of the region close to the active site of the enzyme.

Abstract: The crosstalk between several factors controlling hepcidin synthesis is poorly clarified for different physiological and pathological conditions. Our aim was to study the impact of increasing recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) doses on erythropoiesis, iron metabolism and hepcidin, using a rat model. Male Wistar rats were divided in 5 groups: control (vehicle) and rHuEPO-treated groups (100, 200, 400 and 600IU/kgbody weight/week), 3 times per week, during 3weeks. Hematological and iron data were evaluated. The expression of several genes involved in iron metabolism was analyzed by qPCR. Liver hepcidin protein was evaluated by Western Blot. The rHuEPO treatment induced erythropoiesis and increased transferrin saturation (TSAT) in a dose dependent manner. Tf receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin (HJV) and bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) were up-regulated in rHuEPO200 group. Matriptase-2 was down-regulated in rHuEPO200 group, and up-regulated in the other rHuEPO-treated groups. Hepcidin synthesis was increased in rHuEPO200 group, and repressed in the rHuEPO400 and rHuEPO600 groups. Our study showed that when a high erythropoietic stimulus occurs, hepcidin synthesis is mainly regulated by TSAT; however, when the erythropoiesis rate reaches a specific threshold, extramedullary hematopoiesis is triggered, and the control of hepcidin synthesis is switched to matriptase-2, thus inhibiting hepcidin synthesis.

Abstract: The study of the interaction between RNA and DNA sequences in activating genes has important significance for understanding the mechanisms of RNA-mediated activation. Here, we used in vitro chromatin reconstitution approach to observe whether RNAs increase DNase I digestion, plasmid transfection to observe whether RNAs promote gene expression, and bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding ability of RNAs to centromere DNA (constitutive heterochromatin). Synthetic RNAs (23nt) that were complementary to mouse albumin gene and total liver RNA increased DNase I digestion sensitivity of mouse albumin gene, suggesting that RNAs can increase chromatin accessibility. Transcribed sense-antisense tandem Alu elements activated an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene after stable transfection. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the binding strength of RNA population to centromere DNAs is significantly lower than that of their flanking sequences, which suggests that the centromere is not easily affected by RNAs produced from other transcribed regions and may be the reason why centromeres consist of constitutive heterochromatin. The results in this paper illustrate that RNAs complementary to DNA sequences play roles in activating genes. Since RNA is mainly produced from the cell’s own DNA, the work presented in this paper suggests that RNAs transcribed from DNA create feedback that activates DNA transcription.

Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rch1 is structurally similar to both the vertebrate solute carrier SLC10A7 and Candida albicans Rch1. We show here that ScRCH1 is a functional homolog of CaRCH1. In S. cerevisiae, overexpression of ScRCH1 suppresses, but deletion of ScRCH1 does not affect, the lithium and rapamycin tolerance of pmr1 cells. Overexpression of ScRCH1 reduces expression of ENA1, prevents sustained accumulation of cytosolic calcium and reduces the activation level of calcium/calcineurin signaling in pmr1 cells. Therefore, similar to the situation in the pathogen C. albicans, ScRch1 negatively regulates the cytosolic homeostasis in response to high levels of extracellular calcium. ScRch1 proteins distribute as multiple foci in the plasma membrane prior to cell division, move toward and concentrate at the bud neck as the bud grows in size, and disperse again along the plasma membrane immediately prior to cytokinesis. Furthermore, our genetic and biochemical data also demonstrate that transcriptional expression of RCH1 is positively regulated by calcium/calcineurin signaling through the sole CDRE element in its promoter.

Abstract: Autophagy is an ancient cellular pathway that is conserved from yeast to man. It contributes to many physiological and pathological processes and plays a major role in the degradation of proteins and/or organelles in response to starvation and stress. In the autophagic process cytosolic material is captured into double membrane-bound vesicles, the autophagosomes. After fusion with lysosomes, the cargo is degraded in the generated autolysosomes and then recycled for further use. Autophagy 8 (ATG8, in mammals LC3), a well-established marker of autophagy, is covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine on the autophagic membrane during autophagosome formation. Bioinformatic analysis of the Dictyostelium genome revealed two atg8 genes which encode the ATG8a and ATG8b paralogs. They are with around 14kDa similar in size, 54 % identical to one another and more closely related to the corresponding proteins in fungi and plants than in animals. For ATG8a we found a strong up-regulation throughout the 24h developmental time course while ATG8b expression was highest in vegetative cells followed by a moderate reduction during early development. Confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged ATG8a and ATG8b in vegetative AX2 wild-type and in ATG9− cells showed that both proteins mainly co-localized on vesicular structures with a diameter above 500nm while those smaller than 500nm were predominantly positive for ATG8b. In ATG9− cells we found a strong increase in the relative abundance of ATG8a-positive large vesicular structures and of total ATG8b-positive structures per cell indicating autophagic flux problems in this mutant. We also found that vesicular structures positive for ATG8a and/or ATG8b were also positive for ubiquitin. Live cell imaging of AX2 and ATG9− cells co-expressing combinations of red and green tagged ATG8a, ATG8b or ATG9 revealed transient co localizations of these proteins. Our results suggest that ATG8b associates with nascent autophagosomes before ATG8a. We further find that the process of autophagosome formation in Dictyostelium is highly dynamic. We infer from our data that Dictyostelium ATG8a and ATG8b have distinct functions in autophagosome formation and that ATG8b is the functional orthologue of the mammalian LC3 subfamily and ATG8a of the GABARAP subfamily.

Abstract: Molecular communication between the motoneuron and the muscle is vital for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and maintenance. Disruption in the structure and function of NMJs is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative processes during both development and pathological events. Still due to the complexity of this process, it is very difficult to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying it, generating a keen interest for developing better tools for investigating it. Here we describe a simplified method to study mechanisms of NMJs formation, maintenance and disruption. A spinal cord explant from mice expressing the Hb9::GFP motoneuron marker is plated on one side of a compartmental chamber, and myotubes derived from muscle satellite progenitor cells are plated on the other. The GFP labeled motoneurons extend their axons via microgrooves in the chamber to innervate the muscle cells and to form functional in-vitro NMJs. Next we provide procedures to measure axon growth and to reliably quantify NMJ activity using imaging of both muscle contractions and fast intracellular calcium changes. This platform allows precise control, monitoring and manipulation of subcellular microenvironments. Specifically, it enables to distinguish local from retrograde signaling mechanisms and allows restricted experimental intervention in local compartments along the muscle–neuron route.

Abstract: Concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules operate in extreme conditions, including enhanced solar flux, elevated operating temperature, and frequent thermal cycling. Coupled with active environmental species such as oxygen and moisture, the operating conditions pose a unique materials challenge for guaranteeing operational lifetimes of greater than 25 years. Specifically, the encapsulants used in the optical elements are susceptible to environmental degradation during operation. For example, the interfaces must remain in contact to prevent optical attenuation and thermal runaway. We developed fracture mechanics based metrologies to characterize the adhesion of the silicone encapsulant and its adjacent surfaces, as well as the cohesion of the encapsulant. Further, we studied the effects of weathering on adhesion using an outdoor concentrator operating in excess of 1100 times the AM1.5 direct irradiance and in indoor environmental chambers with broadband ultraviolet (UV) irradiation combined with controlled temperature and humidity. We observed a sharp initial increase in adhesion energy followed by a gradual decrease in adhesion as a result of both outdoor concentrator exposure and indoor UV weathering. We characterized changes in mechanical properties and chemical structures using XPS, FTIR, and DMA to understand the fundamental connection between mechanical strength and the degradation of the silicone encapsulant. We developed physics based models to explain the change in adhesion and to predict operational lifetimes of the materials and their interfaces.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Pharmacologic augmentation of γ-globin expression sufficient to reduce anemia and clinical severity in patients with diverse hemoglobinopathies has been challenging. In studies here, representative molecules from four chemical classes, representing several distinct primary mechanisms of action, were investigated for effects on γ-globin transcriptional repressors, including components of the NuRD complex (LSD1 and HDACs 2–3), and the downstream repressor BCL11A, in erythroid progenitors from hemoglobinopathy patients. Two HDAC inhibitors (MS-275 and SB939), a short-chain fatty acid derivative (sodium dimethylbutyrate [SDMB]), and an agent identified in high-throughput screening, Benserazide, were studied. These therapeutics induced γ-globin mRNA in progenitors above same subject controls up to 20-fold, and increased F-reticulocytes up to 20%. Cellular protein levels of BCL11A, LSD-1, and KLF1 were suppressed by the compounds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a 3.6-fold reduction in LSD1 and HDAC3 occupancy in the γ-globin gene promoter with Benserazide exposure, 3-fold reduction in LSD-1 and HDAC2 occupancy in the γ-globin gene promoter with SDMB exposure, while markers of gene activation (histone H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 demethylation), were enriched 5.7-fold. These findings identify clinical-stage oral therapeutics which inhibit or displace major co-repressors of γ-globin gene transcription and may suggest a rationale for combination therapy to produce enhanced efficacy.

Abstract: BCR-ABL1 gene is a key molecular marker of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but it is still unclear which molecular factors may influence CML risk or lead to variable responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TP53 c.213 G>C(Arg72Pro; rs1042522) polymorphism on CML risk and its correlation with clinical outcome. Peripheral blood samples from 141 treated CML patients and 141 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Standard genetic models for disease penetrance were evaluated by logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier method was performed to estimate survival curves. Our study suggests that TP53 c.213 G>C polymorphism may be involved in CML development considering a recessive model (p=0.01; OR: 0.19; CI: 0.06–0.68). In addition, a non-homogenous distribution was found for this polymorphism in males and patients youngers than 50years (p=0.02). According to clinical response, TP53-GG genotype was associated with higher levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (p=0.04) and shorter event free survival (p=0.04). Moreover, a trend toward significance was found for failure free survival (p=0.06) and time to imatinib failure (p=0.08). In conclusion, our data suggest that a;TP53 c.213 G>C may be a potential biomarker of CML susceptibility and clinical outcome.

Abstract: In this work we report fabrication and study of Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)-Fatty acids composite nanofibrous mats with an aim to develop thermo-regulating enclosures. Fatty acids, an important class of phase change materials (PCM), can serve as energy storage/recovery materials due to their high latent heats. PCM-PVA composite nanomats are fabricated by incorporating the PCMs into electrospun polymeric mats by two methods: (i) in ‘drop-cast’ composite mats, the molten liquid binary mixtures of the PCMs are gently dropped on to the electrospun PVA nanomats and fill the voids by capillary-suction, and (ii) in ‘mixed-and-spun’ composite mats, the fatty acid mixture solution is mixed with the PVA spinning solution and electrospun. The nanofibrous-mats of PVA and a series of mixtures of lauric acid (LA) and stearic acid (SA) prepared using the above two methods are characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Phase diagrams constructed using the transition temperatures from DSC are interpreted as phase diagrams of the LASA binary mixture inside a nanofibrous polymeric medium, as opposed to its bulk phase diagram. The LASA mixture in PVA nanomats exhibits a eutectic phase diagram similar to their phase behavior in bulk. However, the eutectic temperature (Te) is significantly altered in composite nanomats as compared to its bulk value of 39.5°C: Te=34°C in “drop cast” composite mats, and further drops to 30°C in the “mixed-and-spun” composite mats. Tensile tests show considerable softening in the composite mats. Application of regular solution model suggests that an enhanced attraction between LA and SA components, attributed here to nanoconfinement, may be responsible for this change. SEM images show partial wetting of the PVA nanofibers by the fatty acids in “drop cast” composite mats and uniform fibers in “mixed-and-spun” composite mats samples. Thermoregulation ability of these mats is confirmed by monitoring the temperature vs. time profile inside a vial filled with hot water and wrapped around by the composite nanomats.

Abstract: Normal epithelium exists within a dynamic extracellular matrix (ECM) that is tuned to regulate tissue specific epithelial cell function. As such, ECM contributes to tissue homeostasis, differentiation, and disease, including cancer. Though it is now recognized that the functional unit of normal and transformed epithelium is the epithelial cell and its adjacent ECM, we lack a basic understanding of tissue-specific ECM composition and abundance, as well as how physiologic changes in ECM impact cancer risk and outcomes. While traditional proteomic techniques have advanced to robustly identify ECM proteins within tissues, methods to determine absolute abundance have lagged. Here, with a focus on tissues relevant to breast cancer, we utilize mass spectrometry methods optimized for absolute quantitative ECM analysis. Employing an extensive protein extraction and digestion method, combined with stable isotope labeled Quantitative conCATamer (QconCAT) peptides that serve as internal standards for absolute quantification of protein, we quantify 98 ECM, ECM-associated, and cellular proteins in a single analytical run. In rodent models, we applied this approach to the primary site of breast cancer, the normal mammary gland, as well as a common and particularly deadly site of breast cancer metastasis, the liver. We find that mammary gland and liver have distinct ECM abundance and relative composition. Further, we show mammary gland ECM abundance and relative compositions differ across the reproductive cycle, with the most dramatic changes occurring during the pro-tumorigenic window of weaning-induced involution. Combined, this work suggests ECM candidates for investigation of breast cancer progression and metastasis, particularly in postpartum breast cancers that are characterized by high metastatic rates. Finally, we suggest that with use of absolute quantitative ECM proteomics to characterize tissues of interest, it will be possible to reconstruct more relevant in vitro models to investigate tumor-ECM dynamics at higher resolution.

Abstract: The classical chromosome Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of disorders that share clinical, hematological, and histological features. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are elevated in patients with MPN. The aim of this study was to verify the association between the polymorphisms of TNF gene (-308G/A and -238 G/A) in BCR-ABL-negative MPN in our population. Blood samples obtained from MPN patients were genotyped for the JAK2V617F mutation and both TNF polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP. Thirty three (26.8%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 35 (28.7%) essential thrombocythemia (ET), 22 (17.7%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and 33 (26.8%) with unclassifiable MPN (MPNu) were included in the study. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 94 (76.42%) patients. Were observed a significant increase on the frequency of the TNF-238 GA genotype in MPN patients compared to controls (OR=2.21, 95% CI=1.02–4.80, P<0.04). The distribution of the genotypes and allelic frequencies of TNF-308 was significantly different among the MPNs, JAK2V617F positive, PV and PMF, and controls. Our data has demonstrated that the polymorphisms on TNF-238 GA, TNF-308 GA were associated to MPN development in this population, triggered by JAK2 V617F mutation.

Abstract: Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have attracted much interest because they can be fabricated by low temperature process and exhibit high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The PCE is strongly dependent on the interface properties between the PCBM layer and cathode. In this work, solution-processable material, rhodamine 101, was used as the interfacial layer between the PCBM layer and Ag cathode. These interfacial materials significantly increase the fill factor so as to the PCE of the PSCs. The optimal power conversion efficiencies are 13.2% (CH3NH3PbI3) and 14.8% (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) for the devices with rhodamine 101 as the electron collection interlayer, saliently higher than that (8.5% and 12.0%) of control devices without an electron-collection interlayer. The effect of the interfacial material is carefully examined by time-resolved photoluminance spectroscopy (TR-PL), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) techniques. Decreased work-function and energy barrier, enhanced electron extraction and prolonged free carrier lifetime all contributed to the photovoltaic performance improvement.

Abstract: For boron implants made with ion implanters designed for PV applications, a variety of ion species BFx (x=0.2) is implanted, while BF2 accounts for the lions share. We investigate the impact of the BF2 implantation dose and the annealing conditions on the resulting electrical characteristics of industrial bifacial n-type PERT solar cells. For an annealing temperature of 950°C, we observe a steep increase in the emitter saturation current density for BF2 implant doses above 1.75×1015cm−2. We compare co-annealed BF2- and B-implanted solar cells and achieve maximum energy conversion efficiencies of 20.6% with BF2 and 21.0% with B, respectively. Separate annealing processes for the p+ and n+ doped regions result in even higher energy conversion efficiencies of 20.8% with BF2 and 21.5% with B emitter implant. An optimized double-layer ARC applied on the separately annealed cells further increases the efficiency up to 20.9% for BF2 and up to 21.8% for B emitter implant. All efficiency values are independently confirmed. The solar cells have bifacial factors between 97.3% and 99.4%. The BF2-implanted solar cells with highest efficiency feature an emitter with a sheet resistance of 180 Ω/sq. contacted by a commercially available Ag/Al paste with specific contact resistance of less than 10mΩcm2.

Abstract: Gelsolin, a multifunctional actin binding protein, plays a not yet fully understood role in tumorigenesis. Therefore the goal of this study was to identify additional molecular partners of gelsolin in human melanoma cells, separately in the cytoplasmic compartment and cell nuclei. For this purpose we performed immunoprecipitation experiments based on a modified protocol followed by mass spectrometry. The obtained results were confirmed by Western blot analysis, proximity ligation assays and confocal microscopy. As expected gelsolin interacted with actin, in particular we demonstrate its interaction with cytoplasmic β and γ actins, and a newly discovered actin isoform, actbl2. As new gelsolin-interacting partners we identified the ribosomal protein Rpsa, also known as a non-integrin laminin receptor (LamR), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP U. Our data furthermore indicate that gelsolin interacts with particular components of the three cytoskeleton systems: nestin (intermediate filaments), Arp3 (actin cytoskeleton) and β-tubulin (microtubules). We also report for the first time that gelsolin is a constituent of midbodies, a tubulin containing structure formed at the end of cytokinesis.

Abstract: Aims
We aimed to analyse whether quantitative assessment of peripheral blood lymphocyte CD19+CD20+CD22+CD79a+ B cells, CD3+CD4+CD5+CD8+ T cells and CD4+CD25+++Foxp3high Treg can improve prognostication in DLBCL patients.
Methods
The absolute count of lymphocytes, B-cells, T-cells and Treg-cells as well as the percentage of apoptotic cells were assessed by means of flow cytometry in all studied subjects.
Results
Significantly lower level of ALC and the percentage of apoptotic cells have been observed exclusively in DLBCL patients with HR. We also showed, that in comparison with LR, in HR and MR groups, there is a significant decrease in the absolute number of T-cells and Tregs. The applied treatment does no normalize the number of B-cells, Tregs and apoptotic cells only in the case of HR patients.
Conclusions
Lymphopenia, the decreased absolute number of T cells, Tregs, and a percentage of apoptotic cells, correlates with clinical staging in DLBCL patients. The increased number of B cells and the decreased level of Tregs and apoptotic cells after treatment might predict a poor clinical outcome in patients treated with RCHOP. Thereby, flow-cytometry-based evaluation of peripheral blood lymphocytes may be useful in prognostication of newly diagnosed DLBCL patients.

Abstract: The Dictyostelium centrosome is a model for acentriolar centrosomes and it consists of a three-layered core structure surrounded by a corona harboring microtubule nucleation complexes. Its core structure duplicates once per cell cycle at the G2/M transition. Through proteomic analysis of isolated centrosomes we have identified CP91, a 91-kDa coiled coil protein that was localized at the centrosomal core structure. While GFP-CP91 showed almost no mobility in FRAP experiments during interphase, both GFP-CP91 and endogenous CP91 dissociated during mitosis and were absent from spindle poles from late prophase to anaphase. Since this behavior correlates with the disappearance of the central layer upon centrosome duplication, CP91 is a putative component of this layer. When expressed as GFP-fusions, CP91 fragments corresponding to the central coiled coil domain and the preceding N-terminal part (GFP-CP91cc and GFP-CP91N, respectively) also localized to the centrosome but did not show the mitotic redistribution of the full length protein suggesting a regulatory role of the C-terminal domain. Expression of all GFP-fusion proteins suppressed expression of endogenous CP91 and elicited supernumerary centrosomes. This was also very prominent upon depletion of CP91 by RNAi. Additionally, CP91-RNAi cells exhibited heavily increased ploidy due to severe defects in chromosome segregation along with increased cell size and defects in the abscission process during cytokinesis. Our results indicate that CP91 is a central centrosomal core component required for centrosomal integrity, proper centrosome biogenesis and, independently, for abscission during cytokinesis.

Abstract: Activation of Heat shock factor 4-mediated heat shock response is closely associated with postnatal lens development. HSF4 controls the expression of small heat shock proteins (e.g. HSP25 and CRYAB) in lens epithelial cells. However, their roles in modulating lens epithelium homeostasis remain unclear. In this paper, we find that HSF4 is developmentally expressed in mouse lens epithelium and fiber tissue. HSF4 and alpha B-crystallin can selectively protect lens epithelial cells from cisplatin and H2O2 induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔYm) and reducing ROS production. In addition, to our surprise, HSF4 is involved in upregulating lysosome activity. We found mLEC/HA-Hsf4 cells to have increased DLAD expression, lysosome acidity, cathepsin B activity, and degradation of plasmid DNA and GFP-LC3 protein when compared to mLEC/Hsf4-/- cells. Knocking down Cryab from mLEC/HA-Hsf4 cells inhibits HSF4-mediated lysosome acidification, while overexpression of CRYAB can upregulate cathepsin B activity in mLEC/Hsf4-/- cells. CRAYAB can interact with ATP6V1/A the A subunit of the H+ pump vacuolar ATPase, and is colocalized to lamp1 and lamp2 in the lysosome. Collectively, these results suggest that in addition to modulating anti-apoptosis, HSF4 is able to regulate lysosome activity by at least controlling alpha B-crystallin expression, shedding light on a novel molecular mechanism of HSF4 in regulating lens epithelial cell homeostasis.

Tight junctions form a barrier in porcine hair follicles,

Abstract: Follicular penetration has gained increasing interest regarding (i) safety concerns about (environmentally born) xenobiotics available to the hair follicle (HF), e.g. nanomaterials or allergens which should not enter the skin, and (ii) the possibility for non-invasive follicular drug and antigen delivery. However, not much is known about barriers in the HF which have to be surpassed upon uptake and/or penetration into surrounding tissue. Thus, aim of this work was a detailed investigation of this follicular barrier function, as well as particle uptake into the HF of porcine skin which is often used as a model system for human skin for such purposes. We show that follicular tight junctions (TJs) form a continuous barrier from the infundibulum down to the suprabulbar region, complementary to the stratum corneum in the most exposed upper follicular region, but remaining as the only barrier in the less accessible lower follicular regions. In the bulbar region of the HF no TJ barrier was found, demonstrating the importance of freely supplying this hair-forming part with e.g. nutrients or hormones from the dermal microenvironment. Moreover, the dynamic character of the follicular TJ barrier was shown by modulating its permeability using EDTA. After applying polymeric model-nanoparticles (154nm) to the skin, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the majority of the particles were localized in the upper part of the HF where the double-barrier is present. Only few penetrated deeper, reaching regions where TJs act as the only barrier, and no particles were observed in the bulbar, barrier-less region. Lastly, the equivalent expression and distribution of TJ proteins in human and porcine HF further supports the suitability of porcine skin as a predictive model to study the follicular penetration and further biological effects of dermally applied nanomaterials in humans.

Abstract: Functional protein homeostasis is essential for the maintenance of normal cellular physiology, cell growth, and cell survival. Proteasome inhibition in cancer cells can disturb protein homeostasis in such a way that synthetic proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib may selectively kill myeloma cells. Solid cancer cells appear to respond less to bortezomib which may in part be due to a rescue mechanism of the unfolded protein response/endoplasmic reticulum stress mechanism which leads to a temporary shutdown of protein biosynthesis at the translational level. Here we show that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib may also interfere with general protein biosynthesis already at the stage of nucleolar ribosome biogenesis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed not only that bortezomib induces conspicuous changes in cytoplasmic morphology but also pronounced morphological changes of the nucleolar ultrastructure, associated with an accumulation of the transcription factor ATF4 at nucleolar sites. Stress-induced intra-nucleolar ATF4 accumulation was observed in cancer cells in a dose and time dependent manner and ultrastructural studies revealed that ATF4 is preferentially localized inside the dense fibrillar and granular component of nucleoli. Furthermore, bortezomib affected not only the number of nucleoli, but also the volume and distribution of nucleolar components. The localization of ATF4 in the granular component of nucleoli together with its association with nascent RNA transcripts in cells undergoing proteotoxic cell stress could suggest a new function for ATF4 in cell stress management.

Abstract: In present work, we focused on the improvement of short-circuit current density (Jsc) by using zinc-doped TiO2 (Zn-doped TiO2) as electron transport layer. Various Zn-doped TiO2 compact layers with different doping concentrations are prepared by sol-gel method followed thermal treatment, and they were then used to fabricate perovskite solar cell. Effects of zinc (Zn) on the power conversion efficiency (PCE), absorption behavior, crystal structure, electrical conductivity, and surface morphology are systemically elucidated. Charge carrier dynamics between perovskite active layer and titanium dioxide (TiO2) compact layer is discussed too. When the dopant concentration is less than 5.0mol%, the absorption behavior, electrical conductivity and charge separation efficiency increase with Zn doping concentration. In contrast, when the Zn dopant is 7.0mol%, it results in the decay of these properties mentioned. According to the optimized processing of perovskite solar cells, the Jsc is increased from 18.5 to 22.3mA/cm2 so as to the PCE is significantly improved from 11.3% to 14.0%.

Abstract: Circulating megakaryocytic cells abound in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) seen in India and uniquely provide a setting for observing megakaryocytic maturation in the peripheral blood, a milieu not native to megakaryocytes. Peripheral blood megakaryocytic cells were studied in 324 cases of CML (235 chronic, 65 accelerated and 24 blastic phases). Two maturation themes were evident. Megakaryocytic blasts, especially in some cases of blast crisis, precociously make a foray into platelet formation and end up producing huge agranular or poorly granular cytoplasmic lobulated masses, that break off and come to lie in the circulation. This evidence of unsuccessful effort may exist, in a considerably attenuated form in chronic phase, alongside of the second major theme of megakaryocytic maturation centered around the familiar micromegakaryocyte, characteristic of the chronic phase. This cell is regarded as dysplastic, but produces morphologically normal platelets. The possibility that this occurs via a hitherto unstudied alternative path of platelet maturation that plays out in the peripheral blood, and the contrasting disorderly premature attempt of blasts to form platelets, represent exciting maturation processes that need further study. Our observations fortuitously constitute a revisit of the insightful exposition on the subject by George Minot nearly a century ago.

Abstract: Endochondral ossification is an essential skeletal development process which is strongly linked to chondrocyte differentiation. DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3), a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors, is highly expressed in the cartilage plate. However, the role of DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 in chondrocyte differentiation remains to be investigated. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect Ddit3 expression in the mouse growth plate and in the mouse chondroprogenitor cell line ATDC5. A lentivirus system was employed to overexpress Ddit3 and silence its endogenous expression in ATDC5 cells. The differentiation abilities of ATDC5 cells were examined through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and chondrogenic and hypertrophic-related staining. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the protein expression of sex-determining region Y-type high-mobility group box 9 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β. Ddit3 was expressed in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the mouse growth plate. Ddit3 knockdown significantly enhanced the expression of chondrogenic and hypertrophic markers, whereas Ddit3 overexpression decreased the expression of these markers. This finding was also evidenced by Alcian blue staining, proteoglycan synthesis and alkaline phosphatase assay. Additionally, Ddit3 down-regulation significantly led to Sox9 up-regulation. These results suggest that Ddit3 suppresses the differentiation of ATDC5 cells. The function of Ddit3 might partially be regulated by Sox9 expression during chondrogenic and hypertrophic differentiation.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a major health problem worldwide with urgent need for new and effective anti-cancer approaches that allow treating, increasing survival and improving life quality of patients. At pharmacological concentrations, ascorbic acid (AA) exerts a selective cytotoxic effect, whose mechanism of cytotoxicity remains unsolved. It has been suggested that it depends on the production of extracellular hydrogen peroxide, using ascorbate radical as an intermediate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects induced by AA in three colon cancer cell lines, as well as, possible cell death mechanisms involved. Our results showed that pharmacological concentrations of AA induce anti-proliferative, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on three colon cancer cell lines under study. We also found that AA can induce cell death by an increment of oxidative stress, but also mediating a ROS-independent mechanism, as observed in LS1034 cells. This work explores AA anti-tumoral effects and highlights its applicability in the treatment of CC, underlying the importance of proceeding to clinical trials.

Abstract: The serum response factor (SRF) is a neuronal activity regulated transcription factor (TF) mediating an immediate early (IEGs, e.g. cFos, Egr1) and actin cytoskeletal gene response. SRF activity is adjusted by two competing cofactor families, ternary complex factors (TCF; e.g. Elk-1) and myocardin related transcription factors (MRTF). We investigated mechanisms of SRF activation upon seizure associated neuronal activity in mice. SRF serine 103 phosphorylation or promoter binding was not obviously changed upon neuronal activation. In contrast, a SRF directed proteomic analysis uncovered established and potentially novel components of SRF associated protein complexes whose abundance was modified by neuronal activity. This included the general transcription factor TFII-I for which we provide a first functional analysis in neurons. TFII-I modulated neuronal SRF target gene expression, enhanced nerve fiber growth and modulated the shape of neuronal growth cones. Interestingly, TFII-I modulated two SRF cofactors, Elk-1 and MRTF-A, in opposite directions. TFII-I and Elk-1 co-expression enhanced SRF target gene abundance, SRF promoter binding and neurite growth, whereas TFII-I and MRTF-A resulted in opposite outcomes. In summary, we provide a first proteome wide analysis of SRF associated proteins. We characterized TFII-I as modulator of SRF activity by imposing differential impact on two SRF cofactors.

Abstract: SDF-1/CXCL12 is a potent chemokine required for the homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Previous data from our group has shown that in an SDF-1/CXCL12 transgenic mouse model, lineage− Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) bone marrow cells have reduced mitochondrial membrane potential versus wild-type. These results suggested that SDF-1/CXCL12 may function to keep mitochondrial respiration low in immature blood cells in the bone marrow. Low mitochondrial metabolism helps to maintain low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can influence differentiation. To test whether SDF-1/CXCL12 regulates mitochondrial metabolism, we employed the human leukemia cell line HL-60, that expresses high levels of the SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4, as a model of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. We treated HL-60 cells with SDF-1/CXCL12 for 2 and 24h. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR), mitochondrial-associated ATP production, mitochondrial mass, and mitochondrial membrane potential of HL-60 cells were significantly reduced at 2h and increased at 24h as compared to untreated control cells. These biphasic effects of SDF-1/CXCL12 were reproduced with lineage negative primary mouse bone marrow cells, suggesting a novel function of SDF-1/CXCL12 in modulating mitochondrial respiration by regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production and mitochondrial content.

Abstract: There remains controversy over whether individuals with sickle cell trait (SCT) are vulnerable to health risks during physical activity in high temperatures. We examined thermoregulatory and stress-related responses to heat exposure in SCT and wild-type (WT) mice. No significant differences in core temperature (Tc) were observed between SCT and WT mice during heat exposure. There was no correlation between peak Tc during heat exposure and levels of hemoglobin S in SCT mice. Basal levels of circulating inflammatory and stress-related markers were not significantly different between SCT and WT mice. Although heat exposure caused significant increases in plasma interleukins 1β and 6, and 8-isoprostane in SCT and WT mice, no differences were found between SCT and WT mice with similar thermal response profiles during heat exposure. SCT mice had significantly higher expression of heat shock protein 72 in heart, liver and gastrocnemius muscle than WT mice under control and post-heat conditions. In conclusion, there is neither thermoregulatory dysfunction nor abnormal stress-related response in SCT mice exposed to moderate heat. The hemoglobin variant in mice is associated with altered tissue stress protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Human Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase, or its variants, inhibit yeast cell growth by disturbing the actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, and lead to an increase in levels of ubiquitinated proteins. In a screen for multicopy suppressors which rescue growth of yeast cells producing Nedd4 ligase with an inactive WW4 domain (Nedd4w4), we identified a fragment of ATG2 gene encoding part of the Atg2 core autophagy protein. Expression of the Atg2-C1 fragment (aa 1074-1447) improved growth, actin cytoskeleton organization, but did not significantly change the levels of ubiquitinated proteins in these cells. The GFP-Atg2-C1 protein in Nedd4w4-producing cells primarily localized to a single defined structure adjacent to the vacuole, surrounded by an actin filament ring, containing Hsp42 and Hsp104 chaperones. This localization was not affected in several atg deletion mutants, suggesting that it might be distinct from the phagophore assembly site (PAS). However, deletion of ATG18 encoding a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding protein affected the morphology of the GFP-Atg2-C1 structure while deletion of ATG14 encoding a subunit of PI3 kinase suppressed toxicity of Nedd4w4 independently of GFP-Atg2-C1. Further analysis of the Atg2-C1 revealed that it contains an APT1 domain of previously uncharacterized function. Most importantly, we showed that this domain is able to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates, especially PI3P, which is abundant in the PAS and endosomes. Together our results suggest that human Nedd4 ubiquitinates proteins in yeast and causes proteotoxic stress and, with some Atg proteins, leads to formation of a perivacuolar structure, which may be involved in sequestration, aggregation or degradation of proteins.

Abstract: The high mortality of ovarian cancer patients results from the failure of treatment caused by the inherent or acquired chemotherapy drug resistance. It was reported that overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1) in cancer cells can be responsible for the development of drug resistance. To add the high expression of the drug transporter proteins the ALDHA1 is considered as a molecular target in cancer therapy. Therefore, we analysed drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines according to ALDHA1 expression and the association with drug resistance. The expression of ALDH1A1, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was determined using a microarray and confirmed by Q-PCR, western blot and fluorescence analysis. ALDH1A1 activity was determined using an Aldefluor assay. The impact of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) on chemotherapy resistance was assessed by the MTT chemosensitivity assay. The most abundant expression of ALDH1A1 was noted in paclitaxel- and topotecan-resistant cell lines where two populations of ALDH-positive and ALDH-negative cells could be observed. Those cell lines also revealed the overexpression of P-gp and BCRP respectively, and were able to form spheres in non-adherent conditions. Pre-treatment with ATRA and DEAB reduced chemotherapy resistance in both cell lines. ATRA treatment led to downregulation of the ALDH1A1, P-gp and BCRP proteins. DEAB treatment led to downregulation of the P-gp protein and BCRP transcript and protein. Our results indicate that ALDH1A1-positive cancer cells can be responsible for drug resistance development in ovarian cancer. Developing more specific ALDH1A1 inhibitors can increase chemotherapy effectiveness in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with exogenous glucocerebrosidase is indicated to treat symptomatic Gaucher disease (GD), a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. ERT with velaglucerase alfa, which is produced in a human cell line using gene activation technology, was studied in a 12-month phase III trial in Japanese patients with type 1 or 3 GD who were switched from imiglucerase ERT (n=6); the current, open-label, 12-month extension study was designed to assess longer-term safety and efficacy. Two adult and three pediatric patients (aged <18years) were enrolled into the extension study. Every-other-week intravenous infusions were administered for 63–78weeks at average doses between 51.5 and 60.7units/kg. Three non-serious adverse events were considered related to velaglucerase alfa treatment, but no patient discontinued from the study. Six serious but non-drug-related adverse events were reported. No patient tested positive for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. Hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and liver and spleen volumes (normalized to body weight) in these patients were generally stable over a cumulative 24-month period from the baseline of the parent trial. The data suggest that velaglucerase alfa was well tolerated and maintained clinical stability in Japanese GD patients over 2years after switching from imiglucerase.

Abstract: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease that involves the interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors. Previous studies have estimated a heritability of approximately 60% for the risk of VTE. Using variance analysis, intermediate phenotypes related to thrombosis have been used to identify genetic risk factors. Erythrocyte intermediate phenotypes are good candidates for VTE risk factors. We investigated the relationship of erythrocyte-related phenotypes with the risk of VTE. Our study used the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia 2 (GAIT2 Project) sample, which consisted of 35 extended pedigrees (including a total of 935 individuals). The sample had 120 subjects with thromboembolism (86 with VTE, 47 with arterial thrombosis and 13 with both). The following risk factors were evaluated: Red blood cell parameters, reticulocytes, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (STFR), and haptoglobin. Using the variance component method, heritability (h2) and the phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations with VTE were estimated. The h2 of VTE was 0.67. Most erythrocyte parameters showed significantly high h2. In addition, VTE was genetically correlated with: hematocrit (ρG=0.52, p=0.01), red blood cell distribution width (RDW) (ρG=0.28, p=0.05), immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) (ρG=0.45, p=0.008), transferrin saturation index (ρG=−0.7, p=0.05), and STFR (ρG=0.4, p=0.006). In conclusion, a genetic relationship between erythrocyte intermediate phenotypes and VTE was demonstrated. Also, we identified 5 phenotypes as risk factors. These phenotypes are useful in the search for genes that affect VTE.

Abstract: Hemolytic anemia is a common form of anemia due to hemolysis, resulting in disordered iron homeostasis. In this study, a dose of 40mg/kg phenylhydrazine (PHZ) was injected into mice to successfully establish a pronounced anemia animal model, which resulted in stress erythropoiesis and iron absorption. We found that serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration was dramatically elevated by nearly 5000-fold for the first 2days, and then drop to the basal level on day 6 after PHZ injection. Mirrored with serum EPO concentration, the mRNA expression of erythroferrone (ERFE) was rapidly increased in the bone marrow and spleen 3days after injection of PHZ, and then gradually decreased but was still higher than baseline on day 6. In addition, we also found that the hepcidin mRNA levels were gradually reduced almost up to 8-fold on day 5, and then was ameliorated compared to the untreated control. Mechanistic investigation manifested that the increase of serum EPO essentially determined the induction of ERFE expression particular at the first 3days after PHZ treatment. Lentiviral mediated ERFE knockdown significantly restrained hepcidin suppression under PHZ treatment. Thus, our data unearthed EPO-dependent ERFE expression acts as an erythropoiesis-driven regulator of iron metabolism under PHZ-induced hemolytic anemia.

Abstract: We have shown recently that acrolein is strongly involved in cell damage during brain infarction and chronic renal failure. To study the mechanism of acrolein detoxification, we tried to isolate Neuro2a cells with reduced sensitivity to acrolein toxicity (Neuro2a-ATD cells). In one cell line, Neuro2a-ATD1, the level of glutathione (GSH) was increased. We recently isolated a second cell line, Neuro2a-ATD2, and found that acrolein-producing enzymes [polyamine oxidases (PAO); i.e. acetylpolyamine oxidase (AcPAO), and spermine oxidase (SMO)] are reduced in this cell line due to changes at the level of transcription. In the Neuro2a-ATD2 cells, the IC50 of acrolein increased from 4.2 to 6.8μM, and the levels of FosB and C/EBPβ — transcription factors involved in the transcription of AcPAO and SMO genes — were reduced. Transfection of siRNAs for FosB and C/EBPβ reduced the levels of AcPAO and SMO, respectively. In addition, the synthesis of FosB and AcPAO was also decreased by siRNA for C/EBPβ, because C/EBPβ is one of the transcription factors for the FosB gene. It was also found that transfection of siRNA for C/EBPβ decreased SMO promoter activity in Neuro2a cells but not in ATD2 cells confirming that a decrease in C/EBPβ is involved in the reduced SMO activity in Neuro2a-ATD2 cells. Furthermore, transfection of the cDNA for AcPAO or SMO into Neuro2a cells increased the toxicity of acrolein. These results suggest that acrolein is mainly produced from polyamines by PAO.

Abstract: Upconversion of low-energy photons theoretically allows the creation of single-junction solar cells with efficiency far above the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit. However, the net efficiency gains that can be realized depend critically on details of the upconversion process employed. We define three important metrics of the performance of an upconversion material: upconversion quantum efficiency (UQE), photon energy sacrifice (PES), and absorption bandwidth (AB). We analyze the performance of existing upconversion materials relative to both these metrics and existing computational models of a single-junction photovoltaic (PV) cell backed by an upconverter. Guided by the results of this analysis, we develop a design for new solid state upconversion nanostructures that suppresses the dominant energy loss pathways and can enable substantial improvements in overall solar energy harvesting. We describe and model the performance of a specific realization of this design that uses an InAs quantum dot (QD) and a graded InAlBiAs layer to suppress both radiative and nonradiative loss pathways. We show that this design can be tailored to maximize upconversion efficiency and can enable a practical upconversion-backed PV system to exceed the SQ limit.

Abstract: End-binding proteins are capable of tracking the plus-ends of growing microtubules (MTs). The motor protein Ncd, a member of the kinesin-14 family, interacts with EB1 protein and becomes a non-autonomous tip-tracker. Here, we attempted to find out whether at least for Ncd, the efficient EB1-mediated tip-tracking involves the interaction of the kinesin with the MT surface. We prepared a series of Ncd tail mutants in which the MT-binding sites were altered or eliminated. Using TIRF microscopy, we characterized their behavior as tip-trackers and measured the dwell times of single molecules of EB1 and Ncd tail or its mutated forms. The mutated forms of Ncd tail exhibited tip-tracking in the presence of EB1 and the effectiveness of this process was proportional to the affinity of the mutant's tail to MT. Even though the interaction of Ncd with EB1 was weak (Kd∼9μM) the half saturating concentration of EB1 for tip-tracking was 7nM. The dwell time of Ncd tail in the presence of EB1 was ∼1s. The dwell time of EB1 alone was shorter (∼0.3s) and increased considerably in the presence of a large excess of Ncd tail. We demonstrated that tip-tracking of kinesin-14 occurs through several concurrent mechanisms: binding of kinesin only to EB1 located at the MT end, interaction of the kinesin molecules with a composite site formed by EB1 and the MT tip, and probably surface diffusion of the tail along MT. The second mechanism seems to play a crucial role in efficient tip-tracking.

Abstract: Hexokinase (HK) is a key enzyme of glycolysis, the only metabolic pathway able to provide the red blood cell with ATP. HK deficiency is a very rare hereditary disorder with severe chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) as a major clinical feature. To date, only 24 patients with HK deficiency have been identified. Here, we report the molecular analysis of six new cases of HK deficiency. A total of six different mutations were detected in HK1, four of them described here for the first time: c.2599C>T p.(His867Tyr), c.1799C>T p.(Thr600Met), c.873-2A>G and c.493-1G>A. The pathogenic nature of the identified missense mutations was confirmed by biochemical and 3-dimensional structural analysis. The effects of the novel splice site mutation c.873-2A>G were studied at the level of pre-mRNA processing, and confirmed at the protein level. All together, these results provide a better insight into the pathogenesis of this rare red cell disorder, and contribute to a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in HK deficiency.

Abstract: Histamine, a primary mediator of allergic responses, elicits its effects by activating specific receptors belonging to the GPCR family in target cells. Activation of histamine receptor can activate MAP kinases as recorded by monitoring the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). Despite this, ERK phosphorylation does not translate into pro-proliferative changes after histamine stimulation in HeLa cells. Here we show that histamine H1 receptor activation mediates MAPK activation through PLCβ, Src, PKCδ and MEK pathway, but does not lead to nuclear relocalization of phospho-ERK (pERK), classically associated with pro-proliferative changes. Live cell imaging, FRET and FRAP measurements along with functional analysis reveal that pERK generated by histamine activation is physically and functionally restricted in the cytosol and the findings report a spatial regulation of MAPK cascade activated non-canonically through GPCRs unlike its canonical activation by EGF.

Abstract: The phosphorylation status of red blood cell proteins is strongly altered during the infection by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We identify the key phosphorylation events that occur in the erythrocyte membrane and cytoskeleton during infection, by a comparative analysis of global phospho-proteome screens between infected (obtained at schizont stage) and uninfected RBCs. The meta-analysis of reported mass spectrometry studies revealed a novel compendium of 495 phosphorylation sites in 182 human proteins with regulatory roles in red cell morphology and stability, with about 25% of these sites specific to infected cells. A phosphorylation motif analysis detected 7 unique motifs that were largely mapped to kinase consensus sequences of casein kinase II and of protein kinase A/protein kinase C. This analysis highlighted prominent roles for PKA/PKC involving 78 phosphorylation sites. We then compared the phosphorylation status of PKA (PKC) specific sites in adducin, dematin, Band 3 and GLUT-1 in uninfected RBC stimulated or not by cAMP to their phosphorylation status in iRBC. We showed cAMP-induced phosphorylation of adducin S59 by immunoblotting and we were able to demonstrate parasite-induced phosphorylation for adducin S726, Band 3 and GLUT-1, corroborating the protein phosphorylation status in our erythrocyte phosphorylation site compendium.

Abstract: The extract of the herbaceous plant St. John’s wort (SJW) and its phloroglucinol component hyperforin (HPF) were previously shown to inhibit cytokine-induced STAT-1 and NF-κB activation and prevent damage in pancreatic β cells. To further clarify the mechanisms underlying their protective effects, we evaluated the phosphorylation state of various factors of cytokine signaling pathways and the expression of target genes involved in β-cell function, inflammatory response and apoptosis induction. In the INS-1E β-cell line, exposed to a cytokine mixture with/without SJW extract (2–5μg/ml) or HPF (1–5μM), protein phosphorylation was assessed by western blotting and expression of target genes by real-time quantitative PCR. SJW and HPF markedly inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner (from 60 to 100%), cytokine-induced activating phosphorylations of STAT-1, NF-κB p65 subunit and IKK (NF-κB inhibitory subunit IκBα kinase). MAPK and Akt pathways were also modulated by the vegetal compounds through hindrance of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK and Akt phosphorylations, each reduced by at least 65% up to 100% at the higher dose. Consistently, SJW and HPF a) abolished cytokine-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes; b) avoided down-regulation of relevant β-cell functional/differentiation genes; c) corrected cytokine-driven imbalance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, by fully preventing up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes and preserving expression or function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members; d) protected INS-1E cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, SJW extract and HPF exert their protective effects through simultaneous inhibition of multiple phosphorylation steps along various cytokine signaling pathways and consequent restriction of inflammatory and apoptotic gene expression. Thus, they have a promising therapeutic potential for the prevention or limitation of immune-mediated β-cell dysfunction and damage leading to type 1 diabetes.

Abstract: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses have some discrepancies. In addition, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs exhibited significant differences, and 32 key miRNAs among them for target prediction presented opposite trends in the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA-transcription factors, miRNA-predicted targets, miRNA-GOs and miRNA-pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analysed hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in immune system processes, which indicated that the innate and adaptive immunity following EV71 and CA16 infections may be remarkably distinct. In conclusion, this report is the first describing miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs related to the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections.

Abstract: The oncofetal RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 (IGF2 mRNA binding protein 1) is overexpressed in a subset of cancers and promotes cell cycle, migration and aggressive phenotype by regulating post-transcriptionally a number of key mRNAs (e. g, ACTB, CD44, CTNNB1, KRAS, MAPK4, MYC, PTEN and others). IGF2BP1 is also overexpressed in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the biological significance of this phenomenon has not been addressed so far. We have identified leukemia fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA to be highly enriched in immunoprecipitated fraction of endogenous IGF2BP1 from a model cell line REH and t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL samples. Furthermore, downregulation of IGF2BP1 by two-fold has resulted in a corresponding decrease of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA validating this transcript as a target of IGF2BP1 protein in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL. These data infer that IGF2BP1 is a potent regulator of ETV6/RUNX1 mRNA stability and potentially link this evolutionary-highly conserved protein to cell transformation events in ETV6/RUNX1-mediated leukemogenesis of t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL.

Abstract: Hepcidin is the key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. The iron-sensing mechanisms and the role of intracellular iron in modulating hepatic hepcidin secretion are unclear. Therefore, we created a novel cell line, recombinant-TfR1 HepG2, expressing iron-response-element-independent TFRC mRNA to promote cellular iron-overload and examined the effect of excess holotransferrin (5g/L) on cell-surface TfR1, iron content, hepcidin secretion and mRNA expressions of TFRC, HAMP, SLC40A1, HFE and TFR2. Results showed that the recombinant cells exceeded levels of cell-surface TfR1 in wild-type cells under basal (2.8-fold; p<0.03) and holotransferrin-supplemented conditions for 24h and 48h (4.4- and 7.5-fold, respectively; p<0.01). Also, these cells showed higher intracellular iron content than wild-type cells under basal (3-fold; p<0.03) and holotransferrin-supplemented conditions (6.6-fold at 4h; p<0.01). However, hepcidin secretion was not higher than wild-type cells. Moreover, holotransferrin treatment to recombinant cells did not elevate HAMP responses compared to untreated or wild-type cells. In conclusion, increased intracellular iron content in recombinant cells did not increase hepcidin responses compared to wild-type cells, resembling hemochromatosis. Furthermore, TFR2 expression altered within 4h of treatment, while HFE expression altered later at 24h and 48h, suggesting that TFR2 may function prior to HFE in HAMP regulation.

Abstract: Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are gaining interest in various applications due to their tuneable properties and affordable preparation cost. Developing low cost new DESs is vital for some potential industrial applications. This work introduces a new type III DESs based on choline chloride as a quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) and calcium chloride hexahydrate as a hydrated salt. The prepared DESs were characterized by measuring some of their important physical and chemical properties. Furthermore, the applicability of the new DESs as a possible phase change material (PCM) that can be used for building applications was investigated. The experimental results manifested that the DESs in the molar ratios of 1:6 and 1:8 (QAS: hydrated salt) have the potential to be utilized as PCMs in building applications with large latent heat (127.2–135.2kJKg−1) and suitable phase change temperature (20.65–23.05°C), However, they suffered from supercooling and phase segregation. In order to overcome these problems, 2wt% of SrCI2·6H2O as nucleating agent and fumed silica as thickener were used during the 100 thermal cycling test. The cycling results showed the degree of supercooling of the DESs was significantly reduced and the phase change temperatures of the DESs remained unchanged.

Lamellipodial tension, not integrin/ligand binding, is the crucial factor to realise integrin activation and cell migration,

Abstract: The molecular clutch (MC) model proposes that actomyosin-driven force transmission permits integrin-dependent cell migration. To investigate the MC, we introduced diverse talin (TLN) and integrin variants into Flp-In™ T-Rex™ HEK293 cells stably expressing uPAR. Vitronectin variants served as substrate providing uPAR-mediated cell adhesion and optionally integrin binding. This particular system allowed us to selectively analyse key MC proteins and interactions, effectively from the extracellular matrix substrate to intracellular f-actin, and to therewith study mechanobiological aspects of MC engagement also uncoupled from integrin/ligand binding. With this experimental approach, we found that for the initial PIP2-dependent membrane/TLN/f-actin linkage and persistent lamellipodia formation the C-terminal TLN actin binding site (ABS) is dispensable. The establishment of an adequate MC-mediated lamellipodial tension instead depends predominantly on the coupling of this C-terminal TLN ABS to the actomyosin-driven retrograde actin flow force. This lamellipodial tension is crucial for full integrin activation eventually determining integrin-dependent cell migration. In the integrin/ligand-independent condition the frictional membrane resistance participates to these processes. Integrin/ligand binding can also contribute but is not necessarily required.
