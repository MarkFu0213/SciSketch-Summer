Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive lethal malignancy that accounts for more than 90% of pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Our research is focused on the physico-chemical properties of the tumour microenvironment (TME), including its tumoural extracellular matrix (tECM), as they may have an important impact on the success of cancer therapies. PDAC xenografts and their decellularized tECM offer a great material source for research in terms of biomimicry with the original human tumour. Our aim was to evaluate and quantify the physico-chemical properties of the PDAC TME. Both cellularized (native TME) and decellularized (tECM) patient-derived PDAC xenografts were analyzed. A factorial design of experiments identified an optimal combination of factors for effective xenograft decellularization. Our results provide a complete advance in our understanding of the PDAC TME and its corresponding stroma, showing that it presents an interconnected porous architecture with very low permeability and small pores due to the contractility of the cellular components. This fact provides a potential therapeutic strategy based on the therapeutic agent size.

Abstract: The management of major bleeding is a critical aspect of modern healthcare and it is imperative to emphasize the importance of applying Patient Blood Management (PBM) principles. Although transfusion support remains a vital component of bleeding control, treating severe bleeding goes beyond simply replacing lost blood. A more comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize patient outcomes and minimize the risks associated with excessive transfusions.

Abstract: Summary
Water-triboelectric nanogenerators, leveraging contact electrification between water and solid surfaces, have exhibited significant potential to harvest energy. Different configurations of triboelectric nanogenerators offer various functionalities and promising application scenarios. This study introduces a four-electrode droplet triboelectric nanogenerator (FED-TENG). Different connection formats among the four electrodes result in multimodal outputs, enhancing adaptability across diverse applications. The selective generation of direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) output enables efficient, direct driving of DC or AC loads. The device also offers dual outputs distributed evenly or unevenly in power. Evenly distributed dual output accommodates simultaneous power supply to multiple similar loads, while unevenly distributed dual output is recommended for independent sensor applications. Additionally, the charge-transfer process in FED-TENG is dissected to elucidate the mechanism underlying different output modes. Anticipated findings from investigating FED-TENG hold promise for developing adaptable and versatile water-TENGs applicable to droplet energy-harvesting and sensor technologies.

Abstract: Background
T315I mutations of the BCR::ABL1 gene lead to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This study evaluated the performance of digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) in quantifying T315I mutations and their frequency in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive hematological patients.
Methods
The course of disease and BCR::ABL1 fusion transcripts (e13a2, e14a2 and e1a2) were retrospectively reviewed in 21 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 85 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). T315I mutation analysis was carried out using ddPCR and the limit of detection was assessed using mutant T315I DNA at varying variant allele fractions.
Results
T315I mutations were found in two ALL patients and one CML patient without remission in molecular biology and with mutation burdens of 29.20%, 40.85%, and 3.00%, respectively. The mutation burden of ALL patients was higher than that of CML patients, but there was no significant difference between the two (p-value = 0.0536). The test's limit of detection was 0.02% with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 between the expected and actual detection abundances.
Conclusion
T315I mutations have a high incidence in Ph-positive ALL patients even if the course of disease is short. In molecular biology, T315I mutation detection is indicated for CML patients not in remission.

Abstract: Background
Systemic and pulmonary coagulopathy and inflammation are important characteristics of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Whether microparticles that accumulate in transfused red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) have proinflammatory and procoagulant potential and contribute to adverse reactions of RBC transfusions is unclear.
Aim
To investigate the ability of microparticles in stored RBCs to promote thrombin generation and induce human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) activation and damage.
Methods
The number and size of microparticles were determined by flow cytometric and nanoparticle tracking analyses, respectively. Thrombin generation and the intrinsic coagulation pathway were assayed by a calibrated automated thrombogram and by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), respectively. The expression of ICAM-1 and the release of cytokines by endothelial cells were detected by flow cytometric analyses. HMVEC damage was assessed by incubating lipopolysaccharide-activated endothelial cells with MP-primed polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs).
Results
The size of the microparticles in the RBC supernatant was approximately 100–300 nm. Microparticles promoted thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner and the aPTT was shortened. Depleting microparticles from the supernatant of RBCs stored for 35 days by either filtration or centrifugation significantly decreased the promotion of thrombin generation. The expression of ICAM-1 on HMVECs was increased significantly by incubation with isolated microparticles. Furthermore, microparticles induced the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) from HMVECs. Microparticles induced lipopolysaccharide-activated HMVEC damage by priming PMNs, but this effect was prevented by inhibiting the PMNs respiratory burst with apocynin.
Conclusion
Microparticles in stored RBCs promote thrombin generation, HMVEC activation and damage which may be involved in TRALI development.

Abstract: Summary
Aqueous lubrication materials are important in biological systems, but mimicking their properties outside of biological systems is challenging. Here, driven by obtaining shear-stable interfaces that mimic the articular cartilage, a “grafting-into” strategy is developed that allows host-guest self-assembly chemistry going deep into the sub-surface. Adamantane-terminal hydrophilic polymers can recognize β-cyclodextrins (CDs) embedded in silica sol network films through host-guest interaction and thus graft into the sub-surface. The introduction of the silica sol layer results in the promotion of surface load-bearing capacity by 300% while maintaining an ultra-low friction coefficient (∼0.006) and robust anti-fogging/anti-algae performances due to surface super-hydrophilicity. Based on noncovalent host-guest interactions, these characteristic functions can be recovered once the surface is worn. In addition, the method is universal and can realize photo-controllable reversible friction with an azobenzene-terminal hydrophilic polymer. This work presents an approach to prepare high-bearing supramolecular aqueous lubrication materials.

Abstract: Summary
Nickel-catalyzed radical relayed dicarbofunctionalizations of olefins, utilizing carbon electrophiles as coupling partners, present a powerful strategy for the streamlined construction of aliphatic structures. However, traditional solution-phase methods encounter challenges such as the need for bulk solvents, limited coupling partners, long reaction times, and air-/moisture-sensitive reagents. As an alternative strategy, ball-mill-enabled metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have gained attention due to their high reactivity and atomic efficiency. While many ball-mill-enabled cross-coupling reactions are limited to single- and two-component methodologies, three-component solid-state cross-coupling reactions remain relatively scarce. In this work, we report the first, to our knowledge, ball-milling-enabled Ni-catalyzed reductive dicarbofunctionalization of alkenes. Two distinct readily available electrophiles, Csp2 and Csp3 halides, are simultaneously installed across a variety of olefins at room temperature in a highly regioselective manner withing 1.5 h. By harnessing the benefits of ball milling and radical relayed reactions, we anticipate further advancements in sustainable and efficient synthetic methodologies.

Abstract: Summary
The promoter region of proto-oncogene RET has continuous guanine-rich regions I–V, which form G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Reported RET20T G4 in the regions II–V has parallel folding in potassium-ion solutions; however, this G4-DNA is not an ideal drug target, as its formation is limited to a low concentration potassium-ion solution. Here, we demonstrate that RET-21mer in the regions I–IV forms a mixed parallel/anti-parallel G4 in either 50 mM K+ or 100 mM Na+ solutions. It is stable, with a melting temperature of 74.3°C in 100 mM Na+ solution and 91.2°C in 100 mM K+ solution. A loop forms a special G⋅G base-pair plane in K+ solution or an unconventional A⋅G⋅G plane in Na+ solution, stacking with the 3′ end G tetrad, stabilizing its conformation. We also show that RET-21mer G4 could exist under physiological conditions. Therefore, RET-21mer G4s are likely a major G4-DNA, providing a research direction for anti-cancer drug screening.

Abstract: Summary
With the escalating utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources, demand for durable and powerful energy storage systems has increased to secure stable electricity supply. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have received ever-increasing attention as promising energy storage technologies for grid applications. However, their broad market penetration is still obstructed by many challenges, such as high capital cost and inferior long-term stability. In this work, combining the merits of both all-vanadium and iron-chromium RFB systems, a vanadium-chromium RFB (V/Cr RFB) is designed and fabricated. This proposed system possesses a high theoretical voltage of 1.41 V while achieving cost effectiveness by using cheap chromium as one of the reactive species. Experimentally, the system attains a peak power density of over 900 mW cm−2 at 50°C and demonstrates stable performance for 50 cycles with an energy efficiency of over 87%, presenting this system as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Surface-imprinted polymers (SIPs) are biomimetic receptors that emulate the molecular recognition capabilities of antibodies but offer enhanced stability. Traditional contact imprinting for SIP fabrication is labor intensive and can produce inconsistent results due to the manual polymer synthesis. Laying the groundwork for future SIP imprinting with three-dimensional (3D) printers, our study pioneers the use of the Formlabs clear 3D printing resin for creating SIPs geared toward bacterial detection, thus eliminating the manual synthesis step. We produce SIPs using E. coli as a benchmark template bacterium, analyze their structure, and assess their rebinding capacity through fluorescence microscopy. To test cross-selectivity, SIPs for five other bacterial strains are produced and subsequently exposed to each, underscoring the SIPs’ specific affinity for their original bacterial mold. Given its 3D printing suitability and the material’s commercial availability, we envision the use of bacteria-binding imprints on intricate surfaces, bolstering biosensing applications in biotechnology, industry, and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: The cytoplasmic actin proteins, β- and γ-actin, are 99% identical but thought to perform non-redundant functions. The nucleotide coding regions of cytoplasmic actin genes, Actb and Actg1, are 89% identical. Knockout (KO) of Actb by Cre-mediated deletion of first coding exons 2 and 3 in mice is embryonic lethal and fibroblasts derived from KO embryos (MEFs) fail to proliferate. In contrast, Actg1 KO MEFs display with a much milder defect in cell proliferation and Actg1 KO mice are viable, but present with increased perinatal lethality. Recent studies have identified important protein-independent functions for both Actb and Actg1 and demonstrate that deletions within the Actb nucleotide sequence, and not loss of the β-actin protein, cause the most severe phenotypes in KO mice and cells. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to better understand what drives the phenotypes of Actb KO MEFs. RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry reveal largescale changes to the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome in cells lacking Actb but not those only lacking β-actin protein. Pathway analysis of genes and proteins differentially expressed upon Actb KO suggest widespread dysregulation of genes involved in the cell cycle that may explain the severe defect in proliferation.

Abstract: The ongoing phagocytic activity of macrophages necessitates an extraordinary capacity to digest and resolve incoming material. While the initial steps leading to the formation of a terminal phagolysosome are well studied, much less is known about the later stages of this process, namely the degradation and resolution of the phagolysosomal contents. We report that the degradation of targets such as splenocytes and erythrocytes by phagolysosomes occurs in a stepwise fashion, requiring lysis of their plasmalemmal bilayer as an essential initial step. This is achieved by the direct extraction of cholesterol facilitated by Niemann-Pick protein type C2 (NPC2), which in turn hands off cholesterol to NPC1 for export from the phagolysosome. The removal of cholesterol ulimately destabilizes and permeabilizes the membrane of the phagocytic target, allowing access of hydrolases to its internal compartments. In contrast, we found that saposins, which activate the hydrolysis of sphingolipids, are required for lysosomal tubulation, yet are dispensable for the resolution of targets by macrophages. The extraction of cholesterol by NPC2 is therefore envisaged as rate-limiting in the clearance of membrane-bound targets such as apoptotic cells. Selective cholesterol removal appears to be a primary mechanism that enables professional phagocytes to distinguish the target membrane from the phagolysosomal membrane and may be conserved in the resolution of autolysosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen intercalation supercapacitors with high specific capacitance and power density offer potential advantages in various applications. This study explores the potential of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite materials for energy storage, focusing on oxygen intercalation pseudocapacitance properties. The RP structure significantly enhances oxygen intercalation pseudocapacitance by allowing interstitial oxygen intercalation, thereby overcoming limitations associated with oxygen vacancy concentration. Despite the weaker electronic conductivity and lower oxygen vacancy concentration observed in the RP structures, A-site deficiency effectively mitigates these drawbacks. La0.7Sr1.2Fe0.9Co0.1O4 (rp-d-LSFC) exhibits a higher concentration of free electrons, leading to improved conductivity and oxygen vacancy concentrations. Consequently, rp-d-LSFC exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 983.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor cell achieves an impressive energy density of 40.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1,688.3 W kg−1. Density functional theory calculations further support the above results. This work advances our understanding of oxygen intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Electron transfer between oxygen molecules and electrodes is important for various underwater devices. However, the combined difficulties in renewing dissolved oxygen molecules and creating electron transfer are still challenges. In this work, we report cutaneous respiration inspired porous seawater electrodes, which are formed by packing porous seawater, solid electrodes, and dialysis membranes. The dialysis bags allow capture of oxygen molecules from external environments. The porous seawater bridges electron transfer between the renewed oxygen and the solid electrode through sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation under artificial waves. This strategy is expected to enhance performance of underwater devices powered by metal-oxygen batteries and may inspire other technologies that are based on electron transfer between dissolved gas molecules and solid electrodes.

Abstract: Introduction
Due to their low prevalence, rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) remain poorly characterized.
Aim
To gain insight of RBDs through our clinical practice.
Methods
Retrospective study of the medical records of RBD patients followed up at the Central University Hospital of Asturias between January 2019 and December 2022.
Results
A total of 149 patients were included. Factor (F) VII (44 %) and FXI (40 %) deficiencies were the most common diagnosed coagulopathies. Most of the patients were asymptomatic (60.4 %) and the most frequent type of bleeding were mucocutaneous and after surgery. All replacement treatments were administered on demand and no patient was on a prophylaxis regimen. Currently available products were safe; allergic reactions after administration of plasma were the most frequent complication. Genetic analysis, carried out on 55 patients (37 %), showed that the most frequent mutations in RBDs are of missense type (71.9 %). We identified 11 different novel genetic alterations in affected genes. The c.802C > T (p.Arg268Cys) variant, previously described, was identified in 71 % (15 of 21) of the patients with FXI deficiency genotyped and none were related (probable founder effect).
Conclusion
Our study on an unusual large single center cohort of RBD patients portrays location-dependent distinct genetic drives and clinical practice particularities.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is an ecological disaster that requires a plurality of approaches to tackle. There is therefore an ever-pressing need to close the loop on production of both conventional and bioderived plastics. In response, we propose a generalizable biocatalysis engineering strategy to enhance the use of enzymes to depolymerize a broad class of plastics. To demonstrate this approach, we have solubilized and stabilized the commonly available lipase B from Candida antarctica in ionic liquids. In doing so, we unlock the ability of the enzyme to hydrolytically depolymerize post-consumer poly(lactic acid) plastic, demonstrating full degradation within 24 h and full conversion to monomer within 40 h at 90°C. This facile and scalable modification strategy allows for elevated operation temperatures in combination with the superior solvent capabilities of ionic liquids, providing a blueprint for enhancing the capability of any hydrolytic enzyme for plastic recycling.

Abstract: Exacerbated inflammation and coagulation are a hallmark of COVID-19 severity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are intercellular transmitters involved in inflammatory conditions, which are capable of triggering prothrombotic mechanisms. Since the release of EVs is potentially associated with COVID-19-induced coagulopathy, the aim of this study was to evaluate changes in inflammation- and hypercoagulability-related EVs during the first month after symptom onset and to determine whether they are associated with disease severity. Blood samples of patients with mild or severe forms of the disease were collected on three occasions: in the second, third and fourth weeks after symptom onset for the quantification by flow cytometry of CD41A (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), CD162 (PSGL-1), CD31 (PECAM-1) and CD142 cells (tissue factor). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, Kruskal-Wallis and correlation tests were used. Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 71% of whom had mild disease. Seventeen uninfected individuals served as controls. Compared to controls, both mild and severe COVID-19 were associated with higher EV-CD31+, EV-CD41+ and EV-CD142+ levels. All EV levels were higher in severe than in mild COVID-19 only after the third week from symptom onset, as opposed to C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels, which were higher in severe than in mild COVID-19 earlier during disease progression. EV levels were also associated with C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels only after the third week of symptoms. In conclusion, EVs expressing CD41A, CD31, TF, and CD162 appear as late markers of COVID-19 severity. This finding may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of acute and possibly long COVID-19.

Abstract: Background
Sarcopenia, characterized by decreased muscle mass, strength, and function, is associated with adverse outcomes. The prevalence of sarcopenia and the effect of the inflammatory response on muscle strength loss in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are unknown. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia on admission and its associated clinical factors in children and adolescents undergoing HSCT and to determine the extent to which the systemic inflammatory response during hospitalization affects muscle strength.
Method
This was a prospective study of patients aged 6–18 years old undergoing HSCT. The outcome variables were the prevalence of sarcopenia on admission (loss of strength and skeletal muscle mass) and the loss of handgrip strength during hospitalization. Potential explanatory variables included age, sarcopenia, nutritional status and systemic inflammation as measured by serum C-reactive protein, albumin and ferritin concentrations.
Results
Eighty patients with a mean age of 11.5 (± 3.5) years were included. The main diagnoses were acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and aplastic anemia. Eleven percent of patients had sarcopenia upon admission. Female sex, sarcopenia on admission (β coefficient: 0.70; 95% CI: -1.30 to −0.12; p-value = 0.018) and serum C-reactive protein concentration (β coefficient: −0.10; 95% CI: −0.16 to −0.04; p-value = 0.001) were associated with handgrip strength loss from admission to 14 days after HSCT.
Conclusion
Sarcopenia on admission and the degree of systemic inflammatory response are associated with decreased handgrip strength during hospitalization in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT. Further studies using the same criteria for diagnosing sarcopenia are required to enhance our understanding of these relationships.

Abstract: Introduction: Flumatinib, a highly selective ABL kinase inhibitor, exhibits stronger inhibition of intracellular BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, compared to Imatinib. However, there is limited research comparing the real-world efficacy and safety of flumatinib and dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Objective: Investigating the differences in therapeutic efficacy and safety between flumatinib and dasatinib in combination with multi-drug chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Method: In this study, we assessed 43 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (20 in the flumatinib group, 23 in the dasatinib group). Results: There were no significant differences in gender, age, fusion gene type, initial blood routine, bone marrow blast cell ratio or chromosome karyotype between the two groups. Within 1 month, there were no significant differences in the complete response (CR), major molecular response (MMR) or minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate between the flumatinib and dasatinib groups. Similarly, within 3 months, there were no significant differences in CR or MMR rates between the two groups. However, the rates of complete molecular response (CMR) and MRD negativity within 3 months were significantly higher in the flumatinib group, compared to the dasatinib group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the flumatinib group exhibited fewer adverse reactions compared to the dasatinib group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that flumatinib is a safe and effective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for achieving CMR and MRD negativity in patients with Ph+ ALL, as supported by this small series of patients.

Abstract: Summary
One of the advantages of molten salt reactors (MSRs) is their ability to dynamically release volatile fission products such as Kr and Xe from the fuel. In order to manage this consistent radioactive off-gas, unselective delay beds of activated carbon allow the decay of short-lived isotopes. An improved sorbent material would demonstrate both higher delay efficiency and selectivity for Xe over Kr for the added harvesting of valuable noble gases. Here, we integrate a Xe-selective metal-organic framework, SBMOF-1, into engineered beads for the management of off-gases released from MSRs. Pressure-compacted SBMOF-1 pellets outperform the industrial standard at all conditions; at 0°C, sorbent mass and volume are reduced by up to 45% and 52% compared to activated carbon, and the SBMOF-1 pellets demonstrate roughly 50% more substantial Xe/Kr separation than activated carbon at all temperatures. These results motivate the continued development of efficient sorbent technology for MSR off-gas management.

Abstract: Background
Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are a group of disorders with overlapping clinical features that require urgent intervention. Treatment is based on the recognition of the TMA type, which is often challenging. The aim of this study was to identify specific HLA associations with different TMA types to aid rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment, since the HLA assay can be completed within five hours.
Methods
All 86 consecutive patients who presented to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences between May 2013 and January 2021 with a presumptive diagnosis of TMA were included in this study. HLA typing was performed and correlated with other clinical and laboratory studies.
Results
In comparison with other types of TMA, patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) showed increased frequencies of HLA-DRB1*11, HLA-DQB1*03:01/19, HLA-DRB1*08 and HLA-DRB3. Combining the presence of these HLA associations with a PLASMIC score of 6 or more achieved a higher positive predictive value (90%) for identifying aTTP than the PLASMIC score alone (69%). In comparison with other TMA types, patients with aTTP showed decreased frequencies of HLA-DRB4, HLA-DRB1*07, HLA-DQB1*02. The HLA-DRB1*07/DQB1*02 was not observed in any aTTP patients (negative predictive value: 100%), and thus the presence of this haplotype essentially rules out aTTP. Further, HLA-DRB1*11/DQB1*03:01/19 was absent in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome patients.
Conclusion
HLA alleles can be used as an adjunct for the rapid assessment of TMA and can help to differentiate it from other primary and secondary forms of TMA, allowing for earlier definitive therapy.

Abstract: Managing the patient's blood and hematopoietic system is like managing any of the other organs and organ systems during patient care. Specialists control the heart, kidneys, endocrine system, etc. and the patient's blood requires similar clinical treatment. The hematopoietic system and its circulatory products are fundamental for the healthy functioning of the human body. In simple terms, Patient Blood Management (PBM) is an organized, patient-centered approach in which the entire healthcare team coordinates efforts to improve outcomes by managing and preserving the patient's own blood. By reducing dependence on blood transfusions, PBM seeks to improve clinical outcomes, reduce the risks and costs associated with transfusions, and improve the safety and quality of patient care. Essentially, the concept of PBM is about the holistic management and preservation of the patient's own blood in the medical and surgical context.

Abstract: Summary
Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising electromagnetic-absorbing material applied in harsh conditions, but it is challenging to coordinate its impedance matching and attenuation characteristics. Herein, we propose a simple three-step strategy to create three-dimensional (3D) in situ heterogeneous SiC/mullite hollow constructs with efficient electromagnetic absorption property using phenolic-resin-coated fly ash as feedstock. Numerous heterointerfaces exist in the synthesized SiC/mullite composite that provide favorable conditions for significant interfacial polarization. Meanwhile, abundant hierarchical pores resulting from the interior hollow construct of SiC/mullite, interspaces between stacking SiC/mullite, and the gaps among crosslinking SiC/mullite related to 3D printing contribute to improve impedance matching and the multiple-reflection effect. As a result, the SiC/mullite composite shows a minimum reflection loss of −60.89 dB at 17.74 GHz and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (< −10 dB) of 12.06 GHz (5.94–18.00 GHz). This work provides a novel approach for fabricating broadband SiC composite absorbers in an eco-friendly way.

Abstract: Phagocytosis, an innate defense mechanism of multicellular animals, is initiated by specialized surface receptors. A phagocytic receptor expressed by human polymorphonuclear granulocytes, the major professional phagocytes in our body, is one of the fastest evolving human proteins implying a special role in human biology. This receptor, CEACAM3, is a member of the CarcinoEmbryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule (CEACAM) family and dedicated to the immediate recognition and rapid internalization of human-restricted pathogens. In this focused contribution, we will review the special adaptations of this protein, which co-evolves with different species of mucosa-colonizing bacteria. While the extracellular Immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like domain recognizes various bacterial adhesins, an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif (ITAM)-like sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of CEACAM3 constitutes the central signaling hub to trigger actin rearrangements needed for efficient phagocytosis. A major emphasis of this review will be placed on recent findings, which have revealed the multi-level control of this powerful phagocytic device. As tyrosine phosphorylation and small GTPase activity are central for CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis, the counterregulation of CEACAM3 activity involves the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ) as well as the Rac-GTP scavenging protein Cyri-B. Interference with such negative regulatory circuits has revealed that CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis can be strongly enhanced. In principle, the knowledge gained by studying CEACAM3 can be applied to other phagocytic systems and opens the door to treatments, which boost the phagocytic capacity of professional phagocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Commercialization of pyrolysis of plastics in an inert atmosphere is challenging due to large thermal requirements. This study employs thermal oxo-degradation and demonstrates how oxygen supplied at modest equivalence ratios can both accelerate depolymerization and provide the enthalpy for pyrolysis without dramatically impacting desired product yields. The enthalpies for pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) are measured to be 2,300 ± 90 J g−-1 and 2,800 ± 60 J g−1, respectively. Using air as an oxygen source in a fluidized bed reactor, HDPE and PP are rapidly deconstructed while using up to 84% less energy through the energy released by partial oxidation. Characterization of the thermal oxo-degradation product oil shows comparable composition to conventional pyrolysis oil. Thermal oxo-degradation proves to be a promising technology for upcycling of plastics by improving thermal depolymerization of waste plastics and reducing energy requirements while maintaining desirable yields.

Abstract: Chiral actin bundles have been shown to play an important role in cell dynamics, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms which combine to generate chirality remains incomplete. To address this, we numerically simulate a crosslinked filopodial bundle under the actions of helical myosin motors and/or formins and examine the collective buckling and twisting of the actin bundle. We first show that a number of proposed mechanisms to buckle polymerizing actin bundles without motor activity fail under biologically-realistic parameters. We then demonstrate that a simplified model of myosin spinning action at the bundle base effectively “braids” the bundle, but cannot control compaction at the fiber tips. Finally, we show that formin-mediated polymerization and motor activity can act synergitically to compact filopodium bundles, as motor activity bends filaments into shapes that activate twist forces induced by formins. Stochastic fluctuations of actin polymerization rates and slower cross linking dynamics both increase buckling and decrease compaction. We discuss implications of our findings for mechanisms of cytoskeletal chirality.

Abstract: Summary
A carbon capture and utilization strategy, especially the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), is a promising option for achieving carbon neutrality and mitigating climate change. However, currently, the electricity employed for the eCO2RR is mainly derived from gray electricity, and it is often difficult to offset the carbon emissions from power generation of the eCO2RR, which cannot truly achieve carbon neutrality. To circumvent these issues, a self-powered carbon-neutral system integrating the triboelectric nanogenerator-electromagnetic generator (TENG-EMG) with the eCO2RR for industrial exhaust gases is constructed. In this system, the TENG-EMG-based composite generator can convert the kinetic energy of industrial flue gases into green electricity. Subsequently, single-atom copper catalysts can efficiently utilize the electricity generated by generators to realize a remarkably high Faraday efficiency for ethanol. In sharp contrast to traditional eCO2RRs, a self-driven carbon-neutral system can dramatically reduce the costs of generating and transmitting electricity and can truly achieve zero or even negative carbon emissions.

Thrombospondin 4, a mediator and candidate indicator of pain,

Abstract: Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical attention. Existing treatments for pain control are largely ineffective due to the lack of an accurate way to objectively measure pain intensity and a poor understanding of the etiology of pain. Thrombospondin 4(TSP4), a member of the thrombospondin gene family, is expressed in neurons and astrocytes and induces pain by interacting with the calcium channel alpha-2-delta-1 subunit (Cavα2δ1). In the present study we show that TSP4 expression level correlates positively with pain intensity, suggesting that TSP4 could be a novel candidate of pain indicator. Using RNAi-lentivirus (RNAi-LV) to knock down TSP4 both in vivo and in vitro, together with electrophysiological experiments involving paired patch-clamp recordings of evoked action potentials and post-synaptic currents in cultured neurons, we found that TSP4 contributes to the development of bone cancer pain, neuropathic pain, and inflammatory pain. This effect is mediated by regulation of neuron excitability via inhibition of synapsin I (Syn I) and modulation of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic transmission via regulation of vesicular glutamate transporter 2(Vglut2), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) expression. The present study provides a replicable, predictive, valid indicator of pain and demonstrated the underlying molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms by which TSP4 contributes to pain.

Abstract: Background
Erythropoiesis is a complex developmental process in which a hematopoietic stem cell undergoes serial divisions and differentiates through well-defined stages to give rise to red blood cells. Over the last decades, several protocols have been developed to perform ex vivo erythroid differentiation, allowing investigation into erythropoiesis and red cell production in health and disease.
Results
In the current study, we compared the two commonly used protocols by assessing the differentiation kinetics, synchronisation, and cellular yield, using molecular and cellular approaches. Peripheral blood CD34+ cells were cultured in a two-phase (2P) or a four-phase (4P) liquid culture (LC) and monitored for 20 days. Both protocols could recapitulate all stages of erythropoiesis and generate reticulocytes, although to different extents. Higher proliferation and viability rates were achieved in the 4P-LC, with a higher degree of terminal differentiation and enucleation, associated with higher levels of the erythroid-specific transcription factors GATA-1, KLF-1, and TAL-1. Although the 2P-LC protocol was less efficient regarding terminal erythroid differentiation and maturation, it showed a higher yield of erythroid progenitors in the erythropoietin (EPO)-free expansion phase.
Conclusions
We provide data supporting the use of one protocol or the other to study the biological processes occurring in the early or late stages of erythroid differentiation, depending on the physiological process or pathological defect under investigation in a given study.

Abstract: Introduction
The prime responsibility of blood transfusion services in India is to provide safe blood. The donated blood is tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), malaria and syphilis. In India, the screening of donated blood for syphilis is performed by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL), whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends screening of syphilis in blood donors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of RPR and ELISA with the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA – the gold standard) for the detection of syphilis in blood donors.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 1524 consecutive whole blood donors were screened from April to October 2022. All blood samples collected during the study period were tested by RPR, ELISA and the TPHA and the results obtained were compared.
Results
The seroprevalence of syphilis in blood donors in this study was 0.06% by RPR and 0.72% by ELISA and TPHA. On considering ELISA and the TPHA as the gold standard, ELISA had comparable sensitivity (100%), a higher specificity (100% vs. 99.34%), a higher positive predictive value (PPV - 100% vs. 9.1%) and no biological false positive/false negative results (0 vs. 10 false negatives) when compared to RPR.
Conclusion
ELISA performed better as a screening assay than RPR in the detection of syphilis in blood donors, which is in agreement with the WHO recommendations for syphilis testing in blood donors with low prevalence.

Abstract: Summary
Active matter systems are inherently out of equilibrium and break the detailed balance (DB) at the microscopic scale, exhibiting vital collective phenomena such as motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). Here, we introduce a coarse-grained mapping method to probe DB breaking in the density-energy phase space, which allows us to reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical origins of MIPS based on the landscape-flux theory. Hallmarks of nonequilibrium properties are manifested by identifying the visible steady-state probability flux in the coarse-grained phase space. Remarkably, the flux of the system with activity lower than the MIPS threshold has the tendency to split the single potential well of the uniform-density phase and generate two wells of phases with different densities, demonstrating that the nonequilibrium flux is the dynamical origin of MIPS. Moreover, we find that the entropy production rate shows a transition of scaling behavior around the MIPS threshold, providing an indicator for the thermodynamical origin of MIPS.

Abstract: Summary
The inherent weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction of Bi2Te3 semiconductors results in inferior strength, limiting their micromachining into urgently needed thermoelectric microdevices for 5G and the Internet of Things. Here, we report the effect of twin boundary (TB) spacing λ and orientation θ on strength. A physical model of the inverse proportional function between λ and shear strength is developed based on the TBs hindered vdW layer slippage. Then, we establish a sine function model of θ and shear strength based on the bond strain characteristics. Notably, the shear strength (1.64 GPa) of nanotwinned Bi2Te3 with λ = 2.42 nm and θ = 80.54° is 2.5 times higher than that of the flawless single crystal. Moreover, we build a function model between λ and the lattice thermal conductivity κL based on the temperature jump caused by TBs obstructed heat flow. These models provide the basis for developing robust and efficient thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: Background
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare, life-threatening disease in pediatrics. This article describes the clinical features, diagnostic workup, treatment and outcome in patients with AIHA.
Method
Medical charts of under 18-year-old patients with AIHA treated at a tertiary Brazilian institution from 2006 to 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Data analysis was primarily descriptive, using medians, interquartile ranges, and categorical variables presented as absolute frequencies.
Main results
Twenty-four patients (14 female, 10 male) were evaluated in this study. The median age at diagnosis was 5.99 years (range: 0.25–17.1 years) and the median hemoglobin level was 4.85 g/dL (range: 4.17–5.57 g/dL). Most had warm antibodies (83.3 %). Twelve patients (50 %) had known underlining diseases, four (16.6 %) presented with AIHA concomitant with acute infectious diseases and three (12.5 %) had an undetermined post-vaccine association. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin were first-line therapy in 23 cases. Seven patients (29.1 %) required second and third-line treatments (rituximab, cyclophosphamide and splenectomy). The median follow-up period was 4.4 years (range: 1.0–6.7 years). Thirteen patients (54.1 %) were discharged, five cases (20.8 %) were lost to follow-up and no patient died. The median age for the six remaining patients was 11.53 years (8.5–14.7) with all of them having complete responses with no further therapies.
Conclusion
Most cases of AIHA are secondary to an underlying systemic disease or have a possible correlation with infections/vaccines and respond to steroids. The second and third-line therapies for refractory and relapse cases remain a dilemma. A prospective, multicenter study is essential to address the best therapeutic combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Cubic lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (c-LLZO) compositions are promising electrolytes for solid-state lithium metal batteries. However, the extremely low tolerance to electron beam irradiation of c-LLZO has hindered direct evaluation and analysis at the atomic scale, for example by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Herein, we propose a variant of the “nano-shield” method to protect the structures from serious damage due to the energetic electron beam. Using this method, we obtain atomic-resolution STEM images and chemical compositions of c-LLZO along different zone axes at room temperature. Briefly, the nano-shield consists of two amorphous layers, aluminum oxide (AlOx) and carbon, where the insulating AlOx acts as a barrier layer to reduce lithium diffusion rate and the conducting carbon eliminates the charging effect by compensating for the positive charge induced by the incident electrons.

Abstract: Summary
Mass diffusion and local tensile stress associated with electron beam irradiation can favor the desintering process. Here, we report the electron beam-induced desintering of ZrO2 thin films at the atomic scale with unprecedented spatial resolution using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our results confirm earlier works in which desintering is driven by tensile stress acting on the bridge if an external stimulus, such as irradiation, triggers atom mobility. Additionally, we find departures from classical microscopic descriptions: a very stable nanobridge is formed and evolves until rupture with a constant dihedral angle instead of a brittle rupture. An adapted model for desintering at the nanoscale is proposed using the experimental findings. This work provides insights that may improve the knowledge of the rupture of ceramic materials at the nano and atomic scales, contributing to a better knowledge of materials’ behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Investigation of electronic band structure (EBS) plays a pivotal role in the advancement of thermoelectric materials and devices. Sophisticated experiments and theoretical calculations are required to obtain EBS information, representing a bottleneck in studying the vast and increasing number of thermoelectric materials. Herein, we propose a refinement-based approach, referred to as the multi-band refinement technique (MBRT), that combines routine laboratory measurements with computationally inexpensive calculations to acquire EBS information. Experimental data of electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and Hall coefficient along with an electronic transport model act as inputs. The MBRT solver uses this information to iteratively refine electronic structure and scattering parameters by a least-square minimization technique. The efficacy of the MBRT has been validated using silicon, an archetypal semiconductor, and Mg2Si, a well-known thermoelectric material. The results demonstrate that the MBRT can be a powerful tool for studying the effects of temperature, doping, and alloying on the EBS of thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to host Majorana modes, which are of great interest for more fault-tolerant quantum computation, keeps topological superconductors in the focus of research. Here, we report experimental data revealing 100-nm-wide quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) nanoribbons as a promising platform for the realization of zero-energy Majorana modes. One part of the nanoribbon is covered with superconducting niobium, while the other part is connected to a gold lead via two-dimensional QAHI regions. Andreev reflection spectroscopy reveals multiple in-gap conductance peaks in different devices. In the presence of an increasing magnetic field perpendicular to the film, the multiple-peak structure evolves into a single zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Theoretical simulations suggest that the measurements are consistent with the scenario that the increasing field drives the nanoribbons from a multi-channel occupied regime to a single-channel regime, which is the necessary condition for the observation of zero-energy Majorana modes.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of iron-based superconductors proves that high-temperature superconductivity is not limited to cuprates. Here, we use transport measurements to determine the in-plane anisotropy of the upper critical field (Hc2) in detwinned superconducting Ba(Fe1-xMx)2As2 (M = Co, Ni) single crystals. In previous measurements on twinned single crystals, the charge carrier doping dependence of the Hc2 anisotropy for fields along inter-planar and in-plane directions was found to increase in the over-doped regime. For underdoped samples with a spin-nematic phase below the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition temperature, we find that Hc2 along the a axis is considerably lower than that along the b axis. This Hc2 anisotropy disappears in the over-doped regime when the system becomes tetragonal. By combining these results with previous works, we conclude that superconductivity in underdoped iron pnictides is orbital selective—with a dominant contribution from electrons with the dyz orbital character and from being intimately associated with spin excitations.

Abstract: The nuclear envelope (NE) is a critical component in maintaining the function and structure of the eukaryotic nucleus. The NE and lamina are disassembled during each cell cycle to enable an open mitosis. Nuclear architecture construction and deconstruction is a prime example of a circular economy, as it fulfills a highly efficient recycling program bound to continuous assessment of the quality and functionality of the building blocks. Alterations in the nuclear dynamics and lamina structure have emerged as important contributors to both oncogenic transformation and cancer progression. However, the knowledge of the NE breakdown and reassembly is still limited to a fraction of participating proteins and complexes. As cancer cells contain highly diverse nuclei in terms of DNA content, but also in terms of nuclear number, size, and shape, it is of great interest to understand the intricate relationship between these nuclear features in cancer cell pathophysiology. In this review, we provide insights into how those NE dynamics are regulated, and how lamina destabilization processes may alter the NE circular economy. Moreover, we expand the knowledge of the lamina-associated domain region by using strategic algorithms, including Artificial Intelligence, to infer protein associations, assess their function and location, and predict cancer-type specificity with implications for the future of cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Using this approach we identified NUP98 and MECP2 as potential proteins that exhibit upregulation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML) patients with implications for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Summary
Quantum nonlocality as a witness of entanglement plays a crucial role in various fields. Existing quantum monogamy relations rule out the possibility of simultaneous violations of any Bell inequalities with partial statistics generated from one Bell experiment on any multipartite entanglement or post-quantum source. In this article, we report an efficient method to construct a multipartite Bell test based on any Bell inequalities. We demonstrate that violating these monogamy relations can dynamically witness simultaneous Bell nonlocalities of partial systems. We conduct a tripartite experiment to verify quantum nonlocalities by violating a tripartite monogamy relation using a maximally entangled two-photon state.

Abstract: Objectives
To assess the prognostic value of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), at diagnosis and during follow-up, of patients with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma treated at the Hematology Service of the Santa Casa de São Paulo Hospital, and to correlate serum CRP levels with disease stage and treatment response.
Methods
A retrospective study involving review of 71 medical records of patients diagnosed with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma between February 2012 and January 2016 was performed. Three patients were subsequently excluded, giving a total of 68 patients for analysis. A level of CRP > 1mg/dl was considered elevated.
Results
Patients were predominantly male (61.8%) and mean age was 34 years. Fifty-three (78%) patients had advanced stage and (76.5%) had B symptoms. Elevated baseline CRP was associated with greater likelihood of B symptoms (p= 0.02) and of advanced stage (p= 0.015). Patients with Low CRP level after 5th and 6th cycles of chemotherapy was associated with complete response (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). Treatment-refractory patients had greater risk of death (p=0.002).
Conclusion
CRP is clinically important for follow-up of patients with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma, where high levels were associated with advanced disease and/or presence of B symptoms. CRP level was considered a predictor of treatment response. Persistence of high CRP values during treatment was associated with refractoriness.

Abstract: Peripheral blood smear examination is one of the basic steps in the evaluation of different blood cells. It is a confirmatory step after an automated complete blood count analysis. Manual microscopy is time-consuming and requires professional laboratory expertise. Therefore, the turn-around time for peripheral smear in a health care center is approximately 3–4 hours. To avoid the traditional method of manual counting under the microscope a computerized automation of peripheral blood smear examination has been adopted, which is a challenging task in medical diagnostics. In recent times, deep learning techniques have overcome the challenges associated with human microscopic evaluation of peripheral smears and this has led to reduced cost and precise diagnosis. However, their application can be significantly improved by the availability of annotated datasets. This study presents a large customized annotated blood cell dataset (named the Bio-Net dataset from healthy individuals) and blood cell detection and counting in the peripheral blood smear images. A mini-version of the dataset for specialized WBC-based image processing tasks is also equipped to classify the healthy and mature WBCs in their respective classes. An object detection algorithm called You Only Look Once (YOLO) with a refashion disposition has been trained on the novel dataset to automatically detect and classify blood cells into RBCs, WBCs, and platelets and compare the results with other publicly available datasets to highlight the versatility. In short the introduction of the Bio-Net dataset and AI-powered detection and counting offers a significant potential for advancement in biomedical research for analyzing and understanding biological data.

Abstract: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) improved 5-year overall survival rates in relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors (GCTs) from 10% to 52%. Nearly 30% of GCT patients are deemed poor mobilizers after receiving several lines of prior therapy. There is limited data available regarding upfront plerixafor use in GCT patients. We predicted upfront plerixafor use would increase the amount of stem cells collected preventing subsequent mobilizations and improve time to curative therapy. A retrospective, single center, chart review of adult GCT patients who received plerixafor upfront for mobilization at a single center between January 1, 2013 and August 31, 2021 was performed. The primary objective was to evaluate the rate of successful peripheral blood CD34+ cell collections. Secondary objectives consisted of describing the impact of plerixafor use on mobilization and assessing auto-HSCT related outcomes. Sixteen patients received plerixafor upfront after an average of three prior lines of therapy (range: 2-5 lines). Successful collection (≥4 × 106 CD34+ cells/Kg collected within four days) was achieved in 15 (94%) patients in a median of one apheresis day (interquartile range: 1-2 days). All patients proceeded to an initial auto-HSCT and 12 patients (75%) completed both transplants as planned. Survival at 12 months was 50%. The significantly higher amount of CD34+ cells collected over less apheresis days demonstrated the clinical utility of upfront plerixafor and its potential to facilitate more efficient stem cell mobilization. There is a need for larger randomized studies with upfront plerixafor use in this unique patient population.

Abstract: Summary
Peptide-based biopolymers have gained increasing attention due to their versatile applications. A naphthalene dipeptide (2NapFF) can form chirality-dependent tubular micelles, leading to supramolecular gels. The precise molecular arrangement within these micelles and the mechanism governing gelation have remained enigmatic. We determined, at near-atomic resolution, cryoelectron microscopy structures of the 2NapFF micelles LL-tube and LD-tube, generated by the stereoisomers (ʟ,ʟ)-2NapFF and (ʟ,ᴅ)-2NapFF, respectively. The structures reveal that the fundamental packing of dipeptides is driven by the systematic π-π stacking of aromatic rings and that same-charge repulsion between the carbonyl groups is responsible for the stiffness of both tubes. The structural analysis elucidates how a single residue’s altered chirality gives rise to markedly distinct tubular structures and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the pH-dependent gelation of LL- and LD-tubes. The understanding of dipeptide packing and gelation mechanisms provides insights for the rational design of 2NapFF derivatives, enabling the modulation of micellar dimensions.

Abstract: Summary
Catenanes are a family of mechanically interlocked molecules that consist of molecular rings that can be interlocked to give linear, radial, or cyclic structures. Although chemists have pursued extended linear poly[n]catenane architectures for many decades, there still exists a fundamental gap between the synthesis of well-defined, linear oligomers and that of disperse polymers that are often produced as a mixture of architectures. Here, we report two convergent one-pot syntheses that “zip-tie” together two pre-made [3]catenanes by first using orthogonal metal templation with phenanthroline (Cu(I)) and terpyridine (Fe(II)) ligands. These pre-catenate complexes were subjected to a ring-closing metathesis step to afford discrete, linear [7]- and [8]catenanes. The successful synthesis and isolation of the discrete [7]- and [8]catenanes were confirmed using multiple methods of characterization. Because these record-setting linear [n]catenanes possess open phenanthroline metal-binding sites at each end, further expansion to all-interlocked linear poly[n]catenanes is a realistic proposition.

Abstract: Patient Blood Management (PBM) is a multidimensional approach that seeks to optimize the use of blood and its components in patients. This matter emerged as a response to the need to reduce unnecessary exposure to blood transfusions and their potential risks. In the past, blood transfusion was often overused resulting in complications and high costs. The advent of Patient Blood Management has caused a paradigm shift, highlighting anemia prevention, bleeding control and maximizing the production of blood cells by the organism itself. Patient Blood Management guidelines include the early identification of anemia, strategies to minimize blood loss during surgery, intraoperative blood conservation techniques, preoperative hemoglobin optimization and evidence-based approaches to the rational use of blood transfusions. Aiming to improve clinical outcomes, decrease transfusion-related complications and reduce associated costs, this multidisciplinary approach counts on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. Based on research and clinical evidence, Patient Blood Management continues to evolve thereby promoting safer, more effective patient-centered practices. Its implementation has proven beneficial in various medical contexts thereby contributing to improvements in the quality of care provided to patients. Our goal with this Consensus is to present readers with a broad and diverse view of Patient Blood Management so that they have the building blocks to implement this new technique.

Abstract: Summary
Tailoring ion dynamics within nanoconfined spaces presents a new approach for developing advanced iontronic devices. Using various nano-hierarchical materials with nanoconfined spaces can regulate anomalous ionic behaviors, but research on coupling interfacial reactions and ionic dynamics in nanoconfined spaces remains unclear, which limits their applications in energy harvesting. Here, we develop an ultrathin (∼10.5 μm), solid-state, and high-power iontronic power source with an areal energy density of ∼1.4 kWh m−2 and power density of ∼16.07 kW m−2. This is achieved by coupling fine-tuned interfacial Ag/Ag+ redox reactions with efficient cation transport in graphene oxide (GO) nanoconfined channels. The iontronics can also be printed over a large fractal area and be self-charged by a triboelectric nanogenerator, which is crucial for futuristic wearable electronics and neuronal-computer interfaces. This work provides a paradigm of coupling various redox reactions to expand the iontronic systems to wider prospective applications.

Abstract: Introduction
An intracellular parasite of mononuclear phagocytes, mainly distributed in the bone marrow and the spleen, causes visceral leishmaniasis. Complete blood count (CBC) reveals the poorly understood pathogenesis of anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Our study aimed to compare the CBC with bone marrow cytomorphological features and their association with clinical outcomes to clarify this relevant issue.
Methods
The CBC and bone marrow of 118 patients were described by two hematologists and compared to check their association with each other and mortality.
Results
Peripheral cytopenias were common findings, particularly anemia, as seen in almost all patients. No relationship was found between values of hemoglobin, neutrophils and platelet count with fatal outcomes. The bone marrow was normocellular in 61.9% of the cases. Dysplasia figures were frequent and 49.1% of the samples had dysgranulopoiesis. Additionally, erythroid hyperplasia was found in 72% of the patients with severe anemia. Patients with reduced bone marrow cellularity, erythroid hypercellularity and dyserythropoiesis seem to have a riskier disease.
Conclusion
The study results suggest that the bone marrow of patients with visceral leishmaniasis manifests a reactional pattern to the inflammatory event, thereby modulating cytokines and other colony growth factors. This compensatory response may be dysplastic and ineffective and generate peripheral cytopenias of varying intensity. Further studies are needed to clarify the signaling pathways involved, which may be used as therapeutic tools in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators operate based on complex interactions and physical effects between working gas and a nearby solid. As an emerging cooling technology, the heat-driven thermoacoustic refrigerator (HDTR) is a promising avenue for its superiorities of eco-friendly working substances and no mechanical moving components. We report a HDTR with bypass configuration, simultaneously synergizing acoustic and energy-flow fields, thus significantly improving the efficiency. We achieve the highest experimental coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.12, along with a cooling power of 2.53 kW at the heating, ambient, and cooling temperatures of 723, 308, and 280 K, respectively. This COP is 2.7 times that of the previously reported best result for HDTRs, to the best of our knowledge, surpassing adsorption refrigerators and competing with absorption refrigerators. These findings highlight the commercial potential of HDTRs in air-conditioning applications and provide guidance for other cooling applications such as the liquification of natural gas and hydrogen.

Abstract: Managing anemia before surgery is extremely important as it is a clinical condition that can significantly increase surgical risk and affect patient outcomes. Anemia is characterized by a reduction in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin levels leading to a lower oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Proper treatment requires a multifaceted approach to ensure patients are in the best possible condition for surgery and to minimize potential complications. The challenge is recognizing anemia early and implementing a timely intervention to correct it. Anemic patients are more susceptible to surgical complications such as increased infection rates, slower wound healing and increased risk of cardiovascular events during and after surgery. Additionally, anemia can exacerbate existing medical conditions, causing greater strain on organs and organ systems. To correct anemia and optimize patient outcomes, several essential measures must be taken with the most common being identifying and correcting iron deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6, is an essential cofactor in many biosynthetic pathways. The emergence of PLP-dependent enzymes as drug targets and biocatalysts, such as tryptophan synthase (TS), has underlined the demand to understand PLP-dependent catalysis and reaction specificity. The ability of neutron diffraction to resolve the positions of hydrogen atoms makes it an ideal technique to understand how the electrostatic environment and selective protonation of PLP regulates PLP-dependent activities. Facilitated by microgravity crystallization of TS with the Toledo Crystallization Box, we report the 2.1 Å joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of TS with PLP in the internal aldimine form. Positions of hydrogens were directly determined in both the α- and β-active sites, including PLP cofactor. The joint XN structure thus provides insight into the selective protonation of the internal aldimine and the electrostatic environment of TS necessary to understand the overall catalytic mechanism.

Abstract: At the cell surface, the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane interact reciprocally in a variety of processes related to the remodeling of the cell surface. The actin cytoskeleton has been known to modulate membrane organization and reshape the membrane. To this end, actin-membrane linking molecules play a major role in regulating actin assembly and spatially direct the interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane. While studies in cells have provided a wealth of knowledge on the molecular composition and interactions of the actin-membrane interface, the complex molecular interactions make it challenging to elucidate the precise actions of the actin-membrane linkers at the interface. Synthetic reconstituted systems, consisting of model membranes and purified proteins, have been a powerful approach to elucidate how actin-membrane linkers direct actin assembly to drive membrane shape changes. In this review, we will focus only on several actin-membrane linkers that have been studied by using reconstitution systems. We will discuss the design principles of these reconstitution systems and how they have contributed to the understanding of the cellular functions of actin-membrane linkers. Finally, we will provide a perspective on future research directions in understanding the intricate actin-membrane interaction.

Abstract: Summary
Catalytic asymmetric alkylation of α-halogenated enolates is a challenging issue due to their extenuated nucleophilicity and the electrophilic and oxidative nature of the parent α-Cl/Br carbonyl compounds. Herein, by means of coordination-stabilized copper(I) α-F/Cl enolates as the nucleophiles, a catalytic asymmetric alkylation of 2-azaarylesters is achieved with a broad substrate scope on alkyl halides, which constructs halogenated tetrasubstituted carbon centers in good to excellent yields with high enantioselectivity. Moreover, the present alkylation protocol is successfully applied in the building of chiral quaternary carbon centers. Finally, synthetic utilities of the products are demonstrated by several facile transformations based on the alkyl chloride group and the ester group.

Abstract: Summary
Data-driven methods for lithium-ion battery state-of-health (SoH) estimation gain attention for their ability to avoid acquiring prior battery mechanism knowledge. However, most existing methods require massive labeled data, unsuitable for dynamic conditions in the real world. In this study, extracting features from battery dynamic discharge profiles with a small amount of regularly calibrated data (1.5%–15% labeled) is used for capacity estimation. A semi-supervised deep-learning method based on bidirectional gate recurrent unit (biGRU) and structured kernel interpolation (SKI) Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed by employing three features: current rate, pseudo-differential voltage, and temperature. The capacity estimation error of a NASA randomized battery usage dataset is below 1.91% in root-mean-square percentage error (RMSPE). The proposed method is verified on three different random discharge datasets with RMSPE from 2.49% to 3.24%. It provides the feasibility of using dynamic data on battery SoH estimation in electric vehicle applications.

Supercapacitive performance of ionic-liquid-intercalated two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx in redox electrolyte,

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional (2D)-Ti3C2Tx is a promising candidate for supercapacitors; however, it undergoes irreversible oxidation in aqueous acidic electrolytes at a higher anodic potential. Here, we enhance the supercapacitive performance of Ti3C2Tx in the potential range of 0–1 V by a suitable combination of intercalating molecules (for example, EmBF4 [1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium] and BmBF4 [1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium] tetrafluoroborate) and redox electrolytes (for example, H2SO4 plus KI). Pristine Ti3C2Tx, Em-intercalated Ti3C2Tx (Ti3C2Tx-Em), and Bm-intercalated Ti3C2Tx (Ti3C2Tx-Bm) are utilized for supercapacitor applications and show low capacitance and poor stability in 1 M H2SO4. Interestingly, Ti3C2Tx, Ti3C2Tx-Em, and Ti3C2Tx-Bm supercapacitors exhibit improved performance in redox electrolyte. In particular, Ti3C2Tx-Em demonstrates gravimetric capacitance of 725 Fg−1 and >90% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. We attribute this high performance to (1) the higher interlayer spacing of Ti3C2Tx-ionic liquids and (2) effective interaction of the redox pair with the Ti3C2Tx-Em framework. Our findings suggest that incorporating anodic redox pairs into aqueous acidic electrolytes is a valuable strategy to improve the performance of Ti3C2Tx electrodes.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant health burden in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study aims to identify predictive factors of mortality in SCD children admitted to emergency care in Lubumbashi, DRC. We performed a non-interventional cohort follow-up on SCD patients aged 0 to 16 admitted for a “true emergency”. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors associated with mortality. Among the 121 patients included, 24 died during the follow-up period. Univariate regression revealed age, Mikobi score, referral origin, stroke, and severe infection as significant risk factors. Multivariate analyses identified Hb, WBC, SR, and LDH as predictive factors of mortality. Notably, patients aged 12 to 16 years faced a higher risk, shifting the age of mortality from early to late childhood and adolescence. This study provides valuable insights into mortality risk factors for paediatric SCD patients during acute crises. Early diagnosis, regular follow-up, and therapeutic education are essential to improve patient outcomes and survival rates. These findings contribute to better disease management and targeted interventions, aiming to reduce mortality associated with SCD.

Abstract: The ability of a pathogen to survive and cause an infection is often determined by specific interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Such interactions can be both intra- and extracellular and may define the outcome of an infection. There are a range of innovative biochemical, biophysical and bioinformatic techniques currently available to identify protein-protein interactions (PPI) between the host and the pathogen. However, the complexity and the diversity of host-pathogen PPIs has led to the development of several high throughput (HT) techniques that enable the study of multiple interactions at once and/or screen multiple samples at the same time, in an unbiased manner. We review here the major HT laboratory-based technologies employed for host-bacterial interaction studies.

Abstract: Summary
Covalently embedding natural phosphors into a polymer matrix is a particularly appealing approach for producing sustainable room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, the fabrication of such RTP materials remains challenging. Additionally, naturally degradable RTP materials have been scarcely reported although they are crucial for sustainability. Here, we report methacrylated lignosulfonate as a phosphor, which is then covalently embedded within methacrylated gelatin by polymerization. The as-obtained Lig@Gel exhibits phosphorescence of ∼110 ms. Moreover, the Lig@Gel displays excellent biodegradability in a natural soil environment. Life cycle assessment indicates that 10 out of 14 environmental impact categories of our Lig@Gel are approximately 60%–100% lower than those of traditional luminescent materials. As a demonstration of applicability, Lig-RhB@Gel with red afterglow emission is prepared via loading Lig@Gel with rhodamine B (RhB) using an energy-transfer strategy. The as-prepared Lig@Gel and Lig-RhB@Gel could be employed as functional anti-counterfeiting coatings for fibers and paper.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)-based carbonate electrolytes are widely used in commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but their thermal instability limits the cycle life and safety of LIBs at elevated temperatures. Few studies have yielded insight into the initial PF6− decomposition reaction that promotes thermal instability of LiPF6-based electrolytes. Here, we find that lithium-ion hopping assisted by the overall reorientational motion of propylene carbonate molecules facilitates PF6− decomposition at elevated temperatures in 1 M LiPF6/propylene carbonate electrolyte. Further, we demonstrate that urea additives, by preventing lithium-ion hopping, suppress the initial LiPF6 decomposition reaction and enhance the thermal stability of the electrolyte. LIB cell tests with LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2||Li4Ti5O12 show improved LIB performance at elevated temperatures with the thermally stabilized electrolyte. This study provides key insights into the design of thermally stable LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes for improving the cycle life, calendar life, and safety of LIBs in elevated-temperature applications.

Abstract: Summary
The development of sustainable fertilizers prepared from local and renewable resources is an increasingly urgent challenge faced by agricultural and food sectors globally. This challenge is complicated by the need to deliver nutrients directly to crops with minimal environmental impact. Here, we explore the characteristics of an organic silicon fertilizer prepared by treatment of digestate using potassium silicate and calcium chloride. The results show that the fertilizer has a porous structure in which organic matter and nutrients of digestate become embedded, thus facilitating the benefits of digestate by increasing nutrient retention by 72%–98% and decreasing the nutrient leaching rate by 81%–96%. Crop trials demonstrate that crop yields were increased by 20%–91% compared with mineral and organic alternatives. The findings suggest that these fertilizers could enable a cost-effective end use for digestate and have profound implications for the achievement of net-zero policies.

Abstract: Summary
Although “on-water” organic reactions, including organometallics, are a sustainable alternative to traditional strategies, serious concerns related to the safety and feasibility of large-scale application exist. Here, the on-water continuous-flow addition of organolithium reagents to imines is studied in a continuous stirred tank reactor. Fast reaction times (10–20 s) lead to a more productive (gram scale in a 2.5 mL continuous stirred tank reactor) and safer methodology compared to the in-batch reaction. A calorimetric study is performed to understand the thermal behavior and the critical parameters that affect the safety of the process. The methodology is applied to the synthesis of an enantiopure amine. A telescoped process, comprising 3 units of operation (synthesis-inline extraction-separation) that resembles an industrial operation line, is developed, demonstrating the feasibility of the scaleup. Functionalized secondary amines can be synthesized on water, in continuo, with high yields and very short reaction times.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate prediction of ligand-protein interactions is crucial in the initial stages of drug development, especially when focusing on intricate epigenetic targets. This study proposes AMGC, an adaptive multi-task graph conventional network with contrastive learning to predict the inhibitory activities of small molecules against a panel of 67 epigenetic targets. The results show that AMGC outperforms classic molecular fingerprint-based machine learning models and other graph neutral network (GNN) variant-based models in terms of predictive and generalization abilities. Additionally, owing to the advantages of multi-task learning on small datasets, the AMGC approach is well suited for epigenetic target fishing and surpasses the state-of-the-art consensus model ETP. The interpretability of AMGC is verified by highlighting the key atoms in the ligand that interact with surrounding residues. To facilitate easy access, we develop a user-friendly online server for the epigenetic target fishing service.

Abstract: Summary
Oceans absorb 40% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making CO2 removal from seawater as critical as from the air. A reversible pH-shifting seawater process uses hydrogen and redox salt to extract CO2, generating and consuming power during acidification and basification, respectively. An equivalent circuit model predicts performance dependent on key transport and thermodynamic parameters. The need to overcome mass-transport limitations, particularly liquid boundary-layer diffusion, is crucial for industrial current densities. Energy-intensity calculations indicate this process is competitive with prior oceanic CO2 removal processes and even with direct air capture, when pumping energy cost is eliminated. Utilizing variable electricity pricing enables up to $65 (USD) savings per ton of CO2, which is 17% of oceanic and 52% of atmospheric CO2 capture costs. At the present largest desalination plant, 100 kilotons of CO2 can be captured per year, resulting in $6.5 million operational cost savings.

Abstract: Summary
The direct production of iso-olefins using carbon dioxide and hydrogen is a promising alternative to traditional petrochemical routes, but it has not been fully achieved due to the lack of suitable catalysts and processes for the conversion. Herein, we report a tandem process for the direct synthesis of C4-C7 iso-olefins from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The process proceeds by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to C4-C7 n-olefins over a potassium-doped ferroferric oxide and subsequent selective isomerization to C4-C7 iso-olefins over a silica-alumina xerogel. A high C4-C7 iso-olefin selectivity of 35.2% with 37.8% CO2 conversion is obtained. Experiments reveal that the presence of high-density weak Lewis acid sites and the absence of Brønsted acid sites in the silica-aluminum xerogel can inhibit the cracking and hydrogenation of olefin intermediates during isomerization reaction under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, resulting in the selective formation of C4-C7 iso-olefins with a 6.9 iso-/n-olefin ratio.

Abstract: The facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria (L.) monocytogenes may cause severe diseases in humans and animals. The control of listeriosis/L. monocytogenes requires the concerted action of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this regard, cell-intrinsic immunity of infected cells, activated by the immune responses, is crucial for the control and elimination intracellular L. monocytogenes. Both the immune response against L. monocytogenes and cell intrinsic pathogen control are critically regulated by post-translational modifications exerted by the host ubiquitin system and ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls). In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the ubiquitin system and Ubls in listeriosis, as well as future directions of research.

Abstract: Yeast Rho5 is a small GTPase which mediates the response to nutrient and oxidative stress, and triggers mitophagy and apoptosis. We here studied the rapid translocation of a GFP-tagged Rho5 to mitochondria under such stress conditions by live-cell fluorescence microscopy in the background of strains lacking different mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (MOMP). Fun14, Msp1 and Alo1 were found to be required for efficient recruitment of the GTPase, whereas translocation of Dck1 and Lmo1, the subunits of its dimeric GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), remained unaffected. An influence of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) Por1 on the association of GFP-Rho5 with mitochondria under oxidative stress conditions appeared to be strain-dependent. However, epistasis analyses and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) studies indicate a genetic and physical interaction. All four strains lacking a single MOMP were investigated for their effect on mitophagy.

Abstract: While it is well-established that F-actin networks with specific organizations and dynamics are tightly regulated by distinct sets of associated actin-binding proteins (ABPs), how ABPs self-sort to particular F-actin networks remains largely unclear. We report that actin assembly factors Arp2/3 complex and formin Cdc12 tune the association of ABPs fimbrin Fim1 and tropomyosin Cdc8 to different F-actin networks in fission yeast. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of F-actin networks revealed that Fim1 is preferentially directed to Arp2/3-complex mediated actin patches, whereas Cdc8 is preferentially targeted to formin Cdc12-mediated filaments in the contractile ring. To investigate the role of Arp2/3 complex- and formin Cdc12-mediated actin assembly, we used four-color TIRF microscopy to observe the in vitro reconstitution of ABP sorting with purified proteins. Fim1 or Cdc8 alone bind similarly well to filaments assembled by either assembly factor. However, in ‘competition’ reactions containing both actin assembly factors and both ABPs, ∼2.0-fold more Fim1 and ∼3.5-fold more Cdc8 accumulates on Arp2/3 complex branch points and formin Cdc12-assembled actin filaments, respectively. These findings indicate that F-actin assembly factors Arp2/3 complex and formin Cdc12 help facilitate the recruitment of specific ABPs, thereby tuning ABP sorting and subsequently establishing the identity of F-actin networks in fission yeast.

Abstract: Hemostasis plays a critical role in surgical procedures and is essential for a successful outcome. Advances in hemostatic agents offer new approaches to controlling bleeding thereby making surgeries safer. The appropriate choice of these agents is crucial. Volume replacement, another integral part of Patient Blood Management (PBM), maintains adequate tissue perfusion, preventing cellular damage. Individualization in fluid administration is vital with the choice between crystalloids and colloids depending on each case. Colloids, unlike crystalloids, increase oncotic pressure, contributing to fluid retention in the intravascular space. Understanding these aspects is essential to ensure safe and effective surgery, minimizing complications related to blood loss and maintaining the patient's hemodynamic status.

Abstract: Summary
The aviation industry’s shift toward electrification demands greater energy density and enhanced cell safety compared to commercial lithium-ion batteries. Transition metal fluoride cathodes can store multiple lithium ions per metal center through a conversion reaction mechanism, resulting in a 3-fold increase in capacity compared to intercalation compounds. Additionally, fluoride cathodes exhibit remarkable thermal stability due to the ionic nature of the metal-fluoride bond. However, their practical implementation faces challenges due to their limited electronic and ionic conductivity. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of FeF2-Li metal cells in a lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ionic liquid electrolyte. We explored the effects of FeF2 particle size, the distribution of conductive additives within the electrode, and the influence of the bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion on electrochemical behavior and its evolution throughout cycling. Our findings suggest that the rate requirements for electric aviation could be met at 80°C.

Abstract: Summary
Allylic amines are ubiquitous structural motifs found in drugs, natural products, and medicinally relevant molecules. We report here an “ionic-molecular” organocatalysis as a viable substitute for the metal-dependent allylic amination reactions. Mechanistic highlights supported by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and experimental studies highlight the prior covalent ligation of allylic alcohols via ionic catalysis coupled with nucleophilic phosphine catalysis, yielding allylamines via the SN2′-SN2′ (or SN1-SN2′) pathway. Implementation of this ionic-molecular catalysis in heterocyclic functionalizations (N-allylation) with excellent chemo- (N vs. O), regio- (linear vs. branch), and stereo-selectivity (E vs. Z) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (flunarizine, cinnarizine, and naftifine) synthesis has been successfully demonstrated. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis of employed catalysts (RuPhos and DPEPhos) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of representative reactants and solvent (THF) ruled out any traces of transiting metals (Pd, Ni, Fe, Au) commonly employed for the generation of π-allyl metal intermediates, further validating the phenomenon of organocatalysis.

Herein, a donor-acceptor-donor-type fluorescent probe (BTD-Aβ) is prepared using benzothiadiazole (BTD) scaffold as the acceptor, together with p-dimethylaminobenzene and p-hydroxybenzene as donors. The probe is an electrically neutral molecule with low molecular weight of 348.1 Da, large two-photon absorption cross-section of 240 Goeppert-Mayer, red emission centered at 630 nm, and large Stokes shift of 200 nm. In addition, the probe displays improved sensing and imaging capabilities to Aβ aggregates including faster response (within 12 min), higher binding affinity (Kd = 374 nM), higher selectivity, and good blood-brain barrier penetration (16.0%). The probe is successfully used for in situ observation of Aβ42 aggregating in brain-derived endothelial cells and in vivo brain imaging in AD mice.

Abstract: Summary
Incomplete atomic bonding near grain boundaries forms trapping states and creates grain boundary potential energy barriers (Eb), which could influence thermoelectric (TE) properties. Here, we modulate the heights of Eb for light- and heavy-doped hafnium (Hf) in NbFeSb samples at different ball milling (BM) times. With the help of trapping-state model, we find in light-doped samples that Eb increases from 10 meV for the BM-3 h sample to 105 meV for the BM-12 h sample, leading to a reduction in mobility and change in carrier scattering mechanism. Further, we observe that the mobility of heavy-doped samples is unaffected by Eb, which assists to obtain a higher power factor. The stronger phonon scattering also helps to reach lower lattice thermal conductivity. Synergistically, a figure of merit of 0.85 at 973 K is achieved for the Nb0.86Hf0.14FeSb BM-3 h sample. This study offers insights into the role of Eb and could provide a promising method to optimize TE performance.

Abstract: Summary
Bubble evolution plays a vital role in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting process. However, quantitatively relating nucleation site distribution to bubble dynamics and reaction current remains elusive. Here, we investigate the coalescence and detachment processes of double bubbles with different nucleation site spacing (S) using electrochemical measurements and high-speed microscopic imaging. The study reveals three types of detachment mode: the periodic buoyancy-driven detachment mode, the transition mode, and the periodic coalescence-driven detachment mode. These modes are influenced by the coalescence process, which alters the S and results in changes to the bubble detachment radius and detachment frequency. Meanwhile, significant differences in the average reaction current can be obtained by changing S at the same potential. This study elucidates the fundamental relationship between bubble coalescence and detachment characteristics, which provides guidance for optimal design of the electrode morphology in a PEC water-splitting system.

Abstract: Summary
In multiscale phenomena, complex structure-function relationships emerge across different scales, making predictive modeling challenging. The recent scientific literature is exploring the possibility of leveraging machine learning, with a predominant focus on neural networks, excelling in data fitting, but often lacking insight into essential physical information. We propose the adoption of a symbolic data modeling technique, the “Evolutionary Polynomial Regression,” which integrates regression capabilities with the genetic programming paradigm, enabling the derivation of explicit analytical formulas, finally delivering a deeper comprehension of the analyzed physical phenomenon. To demonstrate the key advantages of our multiscale numerical approach, we consider the spider silk case. Based on a recent multiscale experimental dataset, we deduce the dependence of the macroscopic behavior from lower-scale parameters, also offering insights for improving a recent theoretical model by some of the authors. Our approach may represent a proof of concept for modeling in fields governed by multiscale, hierarchical differential equations.

Abstract: Summary
Exploiting the huge compositional space is significant in achieving the superior oxidation resistance of high-entropy carbides (HECs) yet is challenging with conventional synthesis techniques. Herein, we develop an ultrafast high-temperature synthesis apparatus to reach a heating temperature of 3,273 K within seconds. Based on this apparatus, the equiatomic 4- to 9-cation HECs of the IVB, VB, and VIB groups with compositional uniformity are synthesized via carbothermal reduction. The oxidation resistance of all the as-synthesized HEC samples is then investigated via thermogravimetric analysis. The results show that the 6-cation HEC samples possess the best oxidation resistance. Their superior oxidation resistance is attributed to the formation of (Cr, Me)(Ta, Me)O4 and (Cr, Me)2O3 (Me = Hf, Zr, Ta, Nb, Ti, and Cr) protective layers, which are experimentally and theoretically proved to effectively inhibit the inward diffusion of oxygen. Such superior oxidation resistance enables potential applications in extreme environments.

Abstract: Summary
Silicone elastomers exhibit extraordinary compliance, positioning them as a material of choice for soft robots and devices. To accelerate curing times of platinum-catalyzed silicone elastomers, researchers have employed elevated temperatures; however, knowledge of the requisite duration for curing at a given temperature has remained limited to specific elastomers and has relied primarily on empirical trends. This work presents an analytical model based on an Arrhenius framework coupled with data from thermo-rheological experiments to provide guidelines for suitable curing conditions for commercially available addition-cured platinum-catalyzed silicone elastomers. The curing reaction exhibits self-similarity upon normalizing to a dimensionless reaction coordinate, allowing quantification of the extent of curing under arbitrary time-varying thermal conditions. Mechanical testing revealed no significant changes in properties or performance as a result of thermally accelerated curing. With this framework, higher throughput of elastomeric components can be achieved, and the design space for elastomer-based manufacturing can be developed beyond conventional casting.

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most frequent type of cancer of the head and neck area accounting for approx. 377,000 new cancer cases every year. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program plays an important role in OSCC progression and metastasis therefore contributing to a poor prognosis in patients with advanced disease. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) is a powerful inducer of EMT thereby increasing cancer cell aggressiveness. Here, we aimed at identifying RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that affect TGF-ß-induced EMT. To this end we treated oral cancer cells with TGF-ß and identified a total of 643 significantly deregulated protein-coding genes in response to TGF-ß. Of note, 19 genes encoded RBPs with NANOS1 being the most downregulated RBP. Subsequent cellular studies demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of NANOS1 on migration and invasion of SAS oral cancer cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed an interaction of NANOS1 with the TGF-ß receptor 1 (TGFBR1) mRNA, leading to increased decay of this transcript and a reduced TGFBR1 protein expression, thereby preventing downstream TGF-ß/SMAD signaling. In summary, we identified NANOS1 as negative regulator of TGF-ß signaling in oral cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
While lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are a promising next-generation technology, their complex chemistry means they can degrade and fail via numerous mechanisms. To minimize or overcome these modes of failure, we must develop tools that can differentiate between chemical processes in the operating cell, reveal their effects on cell health, and monitor cells throughout their lifetimes. In this study we undertake a comprehensive investigation of the failure modes exhibited by Li-S cells, using the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method. By evaluating the contribution of various electrochemical processes to overall cell resistance, we establish meaningful correlations between performance degradation and specific electrochemical/materials phenomena. Notably, the DRT profiles reveal that the solid-electrolyte interphase resistance can serve as an early indicator of impending cell failure. The methodologies and findings presented in this study hold substantial implications for the advancement of on-board diagnostics tailored for Li-S batteries and other cell chemistries.

Abstract: Summary
α-Secondary alkyl amines are structural motifs frequently encountered in a wide variety of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The N-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) compound is a widely used precursor, acknowledged for its efficacy in implementing a masked amine strategy to access a privileged moiety. Although reductive amination is conducted as a crucial portion of the pharmaceutical industry, direct catalytic access to alkyl Cbz-amine is still rare due to the low reactivity of carbamate. Here, we show a superacid organocatalyst enabled direct access to bioactive Cbz-protected α-secondary alkyl amines using general ketones as the starting material. Through the highly selective and robust catalytic process, a wide substrate scope including drug precursor scaffolds in preparative scalability (up to >99% yield) with practical pharmaceutical syntheses is achieved. The obtained N-Cbz products are found to possess strong cytotoxicities in in vitro bioactivity evaluations, indicating their potential as promising candidates for new anticancer drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperspectral and thermal infrared detectors have rendered single-band camouflage ineffective against the vegetative background commonly used to conceal military equipment, thus threatening the concealment efficacy. Here, to address this challenge, we draw inspiration from natural leaves and develop a bionic metamaterial with a three-layer structure for multispectral-compatible camouflage. This metamaterial exhibits similar solar spectral reflection characteristics to natural leaves and low infrared emissivity, countering both hyperspectral and infrared detections in vegetation backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate a 94.7% similarity in solar spectral reflectance between the bionic metamaterial and natural leaves. Furthermore, the metamaterial’s infrared emissivity is significantly lower (0.64 in 3–5 μm and 0.52 in 8–14 μm) compared to natural leaves (approximately 0.95 in both wavebands). Designed demonstrations verify the effectiveness of the compatible camouflage. This bionic approach opens up feasibilities for enhancing equipment survival on the battlefield and finds applications in multispectral-compatible camouflage, counter-surveillance, and security protection.

Abstract: Introduction
The stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness, painful spasms and rigidity involving the proximal and axial limb muscles, with an estimated incidence of 1 case per million per year. The first line of treatment for symptomatic management includes gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic agonists, benzodiazepines and baclofen. The therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), alone or as an adjuvant to other forms of immunomodulation, has been used as a therapeutic option, particularly in refractory cases.
Methods
An observational study was performed to review SPS patient symptoms, comorbidities, electromyography (EMG) studies and treatment, identifying autoantibodies, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) procedural details and clinical response.
Main results
Five patients (4 male and one female) were treated with TPE during the study period as adjuvant therapy. The average age was 47 years (range 34 - 61 years), and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kilodalton isoform (anti-GAD65) antibodies were positive in 80 % (4/5) of the patient population. All patients received immunosuppressive drugs along with TPE. Four patients received TPE during the first admission and one received it during the third hospital admission. All patients showed good improvement immediately after TPE, but it was not a sustainable effect.
Conclusion
TPE may be helpful as adjuvant therapy for SPS patients to provide relief from clinical symptoms

Abstract: Summary
High-capacity energy storage devices are of interest in various applications, but are not always easy to scale up, and they may experience tradeoffs between areal and gravimetric capacitance. Here, nanoporous WO3/MoO3 films are prepared using electroexploding wire and spray-coating techniques for the exploration of the tradeoffs between areal and gravimetric capacitance. The nanoporous films are extended through nanoparticle stacking, which is accompanied by increasing thickness. The diffusion coefficient measured with cyclic voltammetry increases exponentially with thickness and reaches 1.12 × 10−7 cm2/s for Li-ion intercalations. In galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, the highest areal capacitance of 496 mF/cm2 is obtained at 0.5 mA/cm2 for an 18-μm-thick film, and the gravimetric capacitance is 95.2 F/g at 0.13 A/g for a 1.6-μm-thick film. The film thickness is adjusted to optimize either areal or gravimetric capacitances, and high retention abilities imply the possibility of application in high-performance supercapacitive applications.

Abstract: Summary
Disordered networks are ubiquitous in both natural and synthetic systems, with mechanical properties that span from significantly compliant to extremely rigid. While the significance of network topology in determining their overall mechanical properties has been established, the coupling between network topology and intrinsic material properties to control elasticity and fracture is not well understood. Here, we show that although the topology of two-dimensional disordered networks defines the occurrence of local network bond rupture events, it is the material properties of the constituent material that dictate the energy required to cause failure. Our results reveal opposite trends between the stiffness and fracture properties that depend on the constituent material, which is linked to how topology and materials couple to enhance either the local stiffness or extensibility of the network. We apply this understanding to transform the mechanical properties of an intrinsically low-toughness material to a tough one on demand.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to evaluate the markers of tubular phosphate handling in adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and the influence of hydroxyurea (HU), the degree of anemia and Hb F concentration on these markers.
Methods
Eighty-eight steady state SCA patients in outpatient follow-up in Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil and 31 healthy individuals were included in this study. Vitamin D (25OHD) was measured by enzyme-bound fluorescence assay, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) by electrochemiluminescence, and serum and urinary phosphate and creatinine by colorimetric methods. Details of Hb F and HU use were obtained from clinical records. Tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) and maximum tubular reabsorption of phosphate (MTRP) were calculated. SCA patients were stratified according to the use of HU, degree of anemia and percentage of Hb F. The significance level was set for p-values <0.05.
Results
Compared to controls the 25OHD level (25 ± 11 vs. 30 ± 9 pg/mL) was lower in SCA, while serum phosphate and MTRP were higher (3.86 ± 0.94 vs. 3.46 ± 0.72 and 3.6 ± 1.21 vs. 3.21 ± 0.53, respectively). There was no significant difference in iPTH, TRP and phosphaturia. Serum phosphate showed correlation with TRP (r = 0.32; p-value = 0.008) and MTRP (r = 0.9; p-value <0.001) in SCA. Patients taking HU, especially those with Hb F >10 % presented reduced serum phosphate levels, and TRP and MTRP rates. Those with mild anemia presented reduced serum phosphate levels and MTRP rates.
Conclusion
Serum phosphate levels and renal phosphate reabsorption rate were increased in SCA. HU use, high Hb F concentration and total Hb were associated with better control of tubular phosphate handling markers.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) was the first ribosomopathy described in humans. DBA is a congenital hypoplastic anemia, characterized by macrocytic aregenerative anemia, manifesting by differentiation blockage between the BFU-e/CFU-e developmental erythroid progenitor stages. In 50 % of the DBA cases, various malformations are noted. Strikingly, for a hematological disease with a relative erythroid tropism, DBA is due to ribosomal haploinsufficiency in 24 different ribosomal protein (RP) genes. A few other genes have been described in DBA-like disorders, but they do not fit into the classical DBA phenotype (Sankaran et al., 2012; van Dooijeweert et al., 2022; Toki et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2017 [[1], [2], [3], [4]]). Haploinsufficiency in a RP gene leads to defective ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation, which is a hallmark of DBA. However, the mechanistic understandings of the erythroid tropism defect in DBA are still to be fully defined. Erythroid defect in DBA has been recently been linked in a non-exclusive manner to a number of mechanisms that include: 1) a defect in translation, in particular for the GATA1 erythroid gene; 2) a deficit of HSP70, the GATA1 chaperone, and 3) free heme toxicity. In addition, p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress is involved in DBA pathophysiology. The DBA phenotype may thus result from the combined contributions of various actors, which may explain the heterogenous phenotypes observed in DBA patients, even within the same family.

Abstract: Desmin gene mutations cause myopathies and cardiomyopathies. Our previously characterised R349P desminopathy mice, which carry the ortholog of the common human desmin mutation R350P, showed marked alterations in mitochondrial morphology and function in muscle tissue. By isolating skeletal muscle myoblasts from offspring of R349P desminopathy and p53 knock-out mice, we established an immortalised cellular disease model. Heterozygous and homozygous R349P desmin knock-in and wild-type myoblasts could be well differentiated into multinucleated spontaneously contracting myotubes. The desminopathy myoblasts showed the characteristic disruption of the desmin cytoskeleton and desmin protein aggregation, and the desminopathy myotubes showed the characteristic myofibrillar irregularities. Long-term electrical pulse stimulation promoted myotube differentiation and markedly increased their spontaneous contraction rate. In both heterozygous and homozygous R349P desminopathy myotubes, this treatment restored a regular myofibrillar cross-striation pattern as seen in wild-type myotubes. High-resolution respirometry of mitochondria purified from myotubes by density gradient ultracentrifugation revealed normal oxidative phosphorylation capacity, but a significantly reduced proton leak in mitochondria from the homozygous R349P desmin knock-in cells. Consistent with a reduced proton flux across the inner mitochondrial membrane, our quantitative proteomic analysis of the purified mitochondria revealed significantly reduced levels of ADP/ATP translocases in the homozygous R349P desmin knock-in genotype. As this alteration was also detected in the soleus muscle of R349P desminopathy mice, which, in contrast to the mitochondria purified from cultured cells, showed a variety of other dysregulated mitochondrial proteins, we consider this finding to be an early step in the pathogenesis of secondary mitochondriopathy in desminopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Design of high-performance oxygen carrier materials plays a crucial role in chemical-looping applications. Perovskite-type ABO3 oxides have received significant attention due to their high thermal and mechanical stability and high oxygen mobility. In this work, a promising oxygen carrier, SrFeO3-δ, is systematically substituted, and the subsequent oxygen carrier properties are explored using density functional theory calculations in combination with machine learning methods. We have studied the oxygen vacancy formation energies and Gibbs free energy for a wide range of partial cationic substitutions at the A- and/or B-sites, including in the ground state and at finite temperatures (100–1,200 K). The calculated results are verified by thermogravimetric cycling and oxygen-temperature-programmed desorption measurements. Predictive machine learning models are developed based upon the datasets to identify important chemical-property relationships and confirm a previously investigated system, Sr1-xCaxFe1-yNiyO3-δ, and a discovered system, Sr1-xBaxFe1-yCuyO3-δ, as potential high-performance chemical-looping materials.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that reprogram the transcriptome for cells to survive hypoxic insults and oxidative stress. They are important during embryonic development and reprogram the cells to utilize glycolysis when the oxygen levels are extremely low. This metabolic change facilitates normal cell survival as well as cancer cell survival. The key feature in survival is the transition between acute hypoxia and chronic hypoxia, and this is regulated by the transition between HIF-1 expression and HIF-2/HIF-3 expression. This transition is observed in many human cancers and endothelial cells and referred to as the HIF Switch. Here we discuss the mechanisms involved in the HIF Switch in human endothelial and cancer cells which include mRNA and protein levels of the alpha chains of the HIFs. A major continuing effort in this field is directed towards determining the differences between normal and tumor cell utilization of this important pathway, and how this could lead to potential therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: JM-20 is a 1,5-benzodiazepine compound fused to a dihydropyridine fraction with different pharmacological properties. However, its potential toxic effects on blood cells have not yet been reported. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the possible cytotoxicity of JM-20 through cell viability, cell cycle, morphology changes, reactive species (RS) to DCFH-DA, and lipid peroxidation in human leukocytes, its hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, and its potential DNA genotoxicity using plasmid DNA in vitro. Furthermore, the compound's ability to reduce the DPPH radical was also measured. Human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers (30 ± 10 years old), and the leukocytes or erythrocytes were immediately isolated and treated with different concentrations of JM-20. A cytoprotective effect was exhibited by 10 μM JM-20 against 1 mM tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-but-OOH) in the leukocytes. However, the highest tested concentrations of the compound (20 and 50 μM) changed the morphology and caused a significant decrease in the cell viability of leukocytes (p < 0.05, in comparison with Control). All tested concentrations of JM-20 also resulted in a significant increase in intracellular RS as measured by DCFH-DA in these cells (p < 0.05, in comparison with Control). On the other hand, the results point out a potent antioxidant effect of JM-20, which was similar to the classical antioxidant α-tocopherol. The IC50 value of JM-20 against the lipid peroxidation induced by (FeII) was 1.051 μM ± 0.21, while the IC50 value of α-tocopherol in this parameter was 1.065 μM ± 0.34. Additionally, 50 and 100 μM JM-20 reduced the DPPH radical in a statistically similar way to the 100 μM α-tocopherol (p < 0.05, in comparison with the control). No significant hemolysis in erythrocytes, no cell cycle changes in leukocytes, and no genotoxic effects in plasmid DNA were induced by JM-20 at any tested concentration. The in silico pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of JM-20, derivatives, and nifedipine were also studied. Here, our findings demonstrate that JM-20 and its putative metabolites exhibit similar characteristics to nifedipine, and the in vitro and in silico data support the low toxicity of JM-20 to mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical compression enables direct high-pressure hydrogen generation from chemical hydrogen storage materials in a closed system. By utilizing a water-soluble catalyst, this method achieves rapid formic acid (FA)-mediated sodium borohydride (SBH) hydrolysis, followed by FA dehydrogenation at moderate temperatures, using a mixture of SBH and FA. The sequential reactions facilitate simultaneous dehydrogenation of both carriers without mutual inhibition, resulting in impressive hydrogen pressures (650 bar) and storage capacities (4.22 wt % and 48.25 gH2 L−1) with minimal CO content. The exothermic SBH hydrolysis and endothermic FA dehydrogenation effectively enable heat-coupling reactions, enhancing overall process efficiency. Moreover, the study introduces a cost-effective SBH regeneration method, evaluating the closed hydrogen cycle’s feasibility in SBH-FA chemical compression technology. Economic analysis demonstrates reduced compressor size and overall cost benefits at hydrogen fueling stations, making this innovative approach promising for fuel-cell-based electric vehicle refueling at 700 bars, with potential energy and cost savings.

Abstract: Summary
Developing sufficient dynamics for charge separation and transfer is critical to improve photovoltaic performance. Normally, dynamics can be modulated by band bending via surface engineering, but this has typically been negligible in the p-n homojunction for boosted perovskite solar cells. Herein, we adopt carbon dots as an addition to induce a bilayer p-n perovskite homojunction to improve interfacial charge transfer within perovskite solar cells. Notably, the inclusion of carbon dots induces the spontaneous assembly of a bilayer structure, where the upper layer is enriched with dots and the underlying layer remains pristine perovskite. This unique arrangement creates a p-n homojunction, accompanied by an internal electric field, which allows for modulating energy levels and facilitating charge-carrier separation and transfer. Benefiting from the p-n homojunction, the power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells increases from 18.57% to 21.09%. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of the carbon dots considerably enhances the humidity stability of the solar cells.

Abstract: Summary
Integrating classical estimation and control theory with quantum systems holds potential for quantum measurement improvement. Here, we report a real-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control for spin damping in electron-nuclear spin-coupling regime. The aim is a quicker response and enhanced noise suppression for precision quantum measurements. Using a Kalman quantum observer with electron spin data, we estimate the quantum state of nondirectly observable nuclear spin. LQR full-state feedback optimal control is applied to achieve faster spin-coupling damping. Demonstrated in an atomic spin gyroscope, our method significantly enhances dynamic response with a 4.3-fold improvement in rotational bandwidth. It also boosts long-term stability and measurement sensitivity by 62.9%, presenting a promising avenue to elevate spin-coupling ensemble performance in quantum measurements.

Abstract: Summary
Ultrasonic separation of azeotropic mixtures has long been proposed as a promising separation technique, especially for ethanol-water mixtures. Since ultrasonic separation operates at ambient pressure, uses electricity as an energy source, and does not involve phase transitions, it is expected to have environmental advantages over conventional technologies. However, the economic and environmental potential of ultrasonic separation on a commercial scale remains unknown. We conduct a combined experimental and computational study leading to a data-driven techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of commercial-scale ultrasonic separation. We obtain experimental measurements of ethanol-water ultrasonic separation under room pressure, temperatures of 10°C to 55°C, and carrier gas flow rates of 1 to 5 L min−1 and use them to develop process simulations. Our economic and environmental evaluations show that commercial-scale ultrasonic separation can reduce total annualized cost by more than 10% and CO2-eq emissions by more than 40%, making it a potentially attractive alternative to conventional thermal separation technologies.

Abstract: Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact on blood bank services. The onset of the pandemic led to a decrease in the number of blood donors. A remote interview would avoid deferred donors from having to travel to the blood bank. We evaluate the feasibility of using telemedicine as an alternative to a face-to-face interview as a first blood donor screening.
Methods
Our retrospective study included 404 whole blood and platelets donors, who underwent the clinical interview remotely via telemedicine. The deferred donor would not need to go to the blood bank and eligible candidates were required to donate within 7 days. On the day of donation, a mini-interview was held to ensure donor and blood safety.
Results
The appointments were made from June 2020 to June 2022, including 263 candidates for whole blood (WB) and 141 for platelets (PLTs). At the end of the telemedicine interview, 285 (70.6 %) candidates were considered eligible. Telemedicine was not performed for 60 (14.8 %) candidates due to technical problems (with audio or video) or absences. The deferral rate among candidates who underwent telemedicine pre-screening was 14.6 % and, among eligible donors after telemedicine, only 7 (2.9 %) were unable to donate blood.
Conclusion
Telemedicine is a viable alternative and a welcome convenience for potential donors to avoid unnecessary travel.

Abstract: Background
Blood transfusion is an effective therapeutic practice. However, even adopting all procedures for transfusion safety, there are risks, one of which is immediate adverse reactions. The aim of this study was, by active search, to evaluate the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions estimating the occurrence rate within the first 24 h.
Methods
An exploratory, descriptive, prospective study with quantitative analysis was carried out of patients undergoing surgery who received blood component transfusions during hospitalization from October 2018 to August 2019. Data on blood component request forms were collected from the transfusion agency by reviewing medical records and interviewing the patient or family members. Descriptive statistics and the chi-square test were used to analyze the association of demographic variables with the presence or absence of transfusion reactions.
Results
A total of 1042 blood component units were transfused in 393 transfusions performed on 184 patients. The main transfused blood component was packed red blood cells. Seventeen reactions were identified in the medical records, using the active search method, none of which had been reported. The transfusion reaction rate was 16.3 occurrences per 1000 transfused units, while the notification rate for the 9389 blood component units transfused by the transfusion agency in the study period was 3.83/1000. There was no statistically significant association between the occurrences or not of transfusion reactions and demographic variables.
Conclusion
Through the active search method, it was possible to observe the underreporting of adverse reactions, showing inadequate compliance with current legislation, which is essential to minimize errors and increase transfusion safety.

Abstract: Summary
External magnetic fields can regulate cellular responses when interacting with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Here, we develop a 4D-bioprinted construct by incorporating anisotropic MNPs into a silk fibroin-gelatin bioink with human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells for cartilage regeneration. We measure the magnetic-field-induced temperature response of the acellular construct, determine its mechanical response (actuation), and compare it with the MNPs. Constructs are then magnetically actuated, and their effects on chondrogenesis are investigated. Actuation is induced cyclically every other day (5 min and 30 min/day) for 21 days. Actuation for 30 min exhibits enhanced early (Sox-9 and aggrecan) and late (collagen-II) expression with downregulation of hypertrophic markers (collagen-X and matrix metalloproteinase-13) and enhanced matrix deposition, total collagen, and glycosaminoglycan compared to the constructs actuated for 5 min, kept static, or with no MNPs. Hence, magnetic field actuation could be a significant strategy to stimulate constructs mechanically for articular cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The incorporation of a trideuteromethyl group in diverse pharmaceutical building blocks and drug-like molecules serves as a valuable strategy in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Trideuteromethylation reactions have gained significant, continuous attention at a rapid pace in recent years. However, the lack of known trideuteromethylated reagents prevents the range of applications in terms of substrate and reaction type. In this study, we report the synthesis and application of trideuteromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TT-CD3+OTf−) as a trideuteromethylating reagent that makes use of inexpensive raw material. This reagent performs well in nucleophilic, radical, and transition-metal-catalyzed C–H trideuteromethylations. Microflow technique can enhance and intensify these processes resulting in various trideuteromethylated organic molecules and deuterated pharmaceuticals with comparable yields and high deuterium content.

Abstract: Naringenin (NRG) was characterized for its ability to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction which is linked to cardiovascular diseases. The F1FO-ATPase can act as a molecular target of NRG. The interaction of NRG with this enzyme can avoid the energy transmission mechanism of ATP hydrolysis, especially in the presence of Ca2+ cation used as cofactor. Indeed, NRG was a selective inhibitor of the hydrophilic F1 domain displaying a binding site overlapped with quercetin in the inside surface of an annulus made by the three α and the three β subunits arranged alternatively in a hexamer. The kinetic constant of inhibition suggested that NRG preferred the enzyme activated by Ca2+ rather than the F1FO-ATPase activated by the natural cofactor Mg2+. From the inhibition type mechanism of NRG stemmed the possibility to speculate that NRG can prevent the activation of F1FO-ATPase by Ca2+. The event correlated to the protective role in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening by NRG as well as to the reduction of ROS production probably linked to the NRG chemical structure with antioxidant action. Moreover, in primary cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) obtained from stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rats NRG had a protective effect on salt-induced injury by restoring cell viability and endothelial cell tube formation while also rescuing complex I activity.

Abstract: Dyslipidemia is frequently observed in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Changes in plasma lipid levels potentially alter erythrocyte membrane lipid composition due to lack of inbuilt lipid synthesis machinery. Therefore, development of morphologically altered erythrocytes in PCOS patients with dyslipidemia is expected. However, this has not been established so far. So, we took this opportunity to explore the morphological alterations among dyslipidemic PCO women. We recruited thirty-five dyslipidemic PCOS women (satisfying Rotterdam criteria, without medication) and twenty-five age-matched healthy controls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a significant increase in the number of stomatocytes, acanthocytes, and echinocytes in the PCO group. PCO group showed a considerable decrease in plasma antioxidant levels. Elevated lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and decreased free thiol group in erythrocyte membrane in PCOS suggest oxidative degradation of the erythrocyte membrane. Elevated intracellular ROS levels, increased methemoglobin formation, and a decrease in NADPH methemoglobin reductase in PCOS also indicate altered physicochemical property of hemoglobin due to oxidative overload. Additionally, these patients exhibit a rise in erythrocyte membrane cholesterol and triglyceride, which promotes the membrane to become less fluidic and less fragile. Thus, these results corroborate a potential role in altering erythrocyte morphology among dyslipidemic PCO women.

Abstract: Bacteria divide by binary fission. The protein machine responsible for this process is the divisome, a transient assembly of more than 30 proteins in and on the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Together, they constrict the cell envelope and remodel the peptidoglycan layer to eventually split the cell into two. For Escherichia coli, most molecular players involved in this process have probably been identified, but obtaining the quantitative information needed for a mechanistic understanding can often not be achieved from experiments in vivo alone. Since the discovery of the Z-ring more than 30 years ago, in vitro reconstitution experiments have been crucial to shed light on molecular processes normally hidden in the complex environment of the living cell. In this review, we summarize how rebuilding the divisome from purified components – or at least parts of it - have been instrumental to obtain the detailed mechanistic understanding of the bacterial cell division machinery that we have today.
