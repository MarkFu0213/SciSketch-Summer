Abstract: The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to model human complex diseases is gaining popularity as it allows investigation of human cells that are otherwise sparsely available. However, due to its laborious and cost intensive nature, iPSC research is often plagued by limited sample size and putative large variability between clones, decreasing statistical power for detecting experimental effects. Here, we investigate the source and magnitude of variability in the proteome of parallel differentiated astrocytes using mass spectrometry. We compare three possible sources of variability: inter-donor variability, inter- and intra-clonal variability, at different stages of maturation. We show that the interclonal variability is significantly smaller than the inter-donor variability, and that including more donors has a much larger influence on statistical power than adding more clones per donor. Our results provide insight into the sources of variability at protein level between iPSC samples derived in parallel and will aid in optimizing iPSC studies.

Abstract: The dysregulation of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which regulate the stability of most cellular proteins, have been implicated in many human diseases, including cancers. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18), a member of the DUBs family, functions as a potential tumour promoter in various cancers. However, the biological function and clinical significance of USP18 in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) are still unclear. Here, we found that ESCC tumors had higher USP18 expression compared with that of normal esophageal epithelial tissues, and high USP18 level was significantly correlated with malignant phenotype and shorter survival in patients with ESCC. In functional experiments, USP18 knockdown significantly inhibited ESCC invasion and metastasis in vitro. Consistently, a xenograft assay showed that knockdown of USP18 in ESCC cell suppressed their dissemination to lung tissue in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that USP18 promoted ESCC cell metastasis by inducing ZEB1 mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, our results demonstrated that the oncogenic effect of USP18 in ESCC is partially dependent on ZEB1 enhancement. Mechanistic investigations revealed that USP18 directly bound ZEB1 and decreased its ubiquitination to enhance the protein stability of ZEB1 in ESCC cells. Overall, our data highlighted an essential role of USP18 in ESCC metastasis, suggesting that it could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for ESCC.

Abstract: Hair follicle regeneration has been successful in mice but failed in human being for years. Dermal papilla cells, a specialized mesenchymal stem cell derived from dermal papilla within hair follicles, is considered the key cells for hair follicle regeneration function as both regeneration initiator and regulator. Injectable platelet rich fibrin (i-PRF), a novel biomaterial rich in a variety of growth factors and three-dimensional scaffolds, has shown promising effects on tissue regeneration. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the application of i-PRF in human hair follicle regeneration by examining the biological effects of i-PRF on human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). Biomaterial compatibility, cell viability, proliferation, migration, alkaline phosphatase activity and trichogenic inductivity were assessed after exposing hDPCs to different concentrations of i-PRF extracts. In addition, we investigated the ultrastructure of i-PRF with all cell components filtered. The results revealed that i-PRF possessing excellent biocompatibility and could significantly promote hDPCs proliferation, migration, and trichogenic inductivity. Furthermore, the concentration of i-PRF is able to remarkably influence hDPCs behavior in a dose-dependent pattern. Different concentrations exhibited differential effects on hDPCs behavior. In general, lower concentration promotes cell proliferation better than higher concentration, while higher concentration promotes cell function better reversely. Best concentration for hDPCs in vitro expending is 1% concentration. 20% concentration is optimal for hair follicle regeneration. In summary, our findings concluded that i-PRF facilitates hair follicle regeneration by promoting human dermal papilla cell proliferation, migration, and trichogenic inductivity.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane proteins are central to many pathophysiological processes, yet remain very difficult to analyze structurally. Moreover, high-throughput structure-based drug discovery has not yet been exploited for membrane proteins because of lack of automation. Here, we present a facile and versatile platform for in meso membrane protein crystallization, enabling rapid atomic structure determination at both cryogenic and room temperatures. We apply this approach to human integral membrane proteins, which allowed us to identify different conformational states of intramembrane enzyme-product complexes and analyze by molecular dynamics simulations the structural dynamics of the ADIPOR2 integral membrane protein. Finally, we demonstrate an automated pipeline combining high-throughput microcrystal soaking, automated laser-based harvesting, and serial crystallography, enabling screening of small-molecule libraries with membrane protein crystals grown in meso. This approach brings needed automation to this important class of drug targets and enables high-throughput structure-based ligand discovery with membrane proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Leveraging systems biology approaches, we illustrate how metabolically distinct species of Clostridia protect against or worsen Clostridioides difficile infection in mice by modulating the pathogen’s colonization, growth, and virulence to impact host survival. Gnotobiotic mice colonized with the amino acid fermenter Paraclostridium bifermentans survive infection with reduced disease severity, while mice colonized with the butyrate-producer, Clostridium sardiniense, succumb more rapidly. Systematic in vivo analyses revealed how each commensal alters the gut-nutrient environment to modulate the pathogen’s metabolism, gene regulatory networks, and toxin production. Oral administration of P. bifermentans rescues conventional, clindamycin-treated mice from lethal C. difficile infection in a manner similar to that of monocolonized animals, thereby supporting the therapeutic potential of this commensal species. Our findings lay the foundation for mechanistically informed therapies to counter C. difficile disease using systems biology approaches to define host-commensal-pathogen interactions in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding viral tropism is an essential step toward reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, decreasing mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and limiting opportunities for mutant strains to arise. Currently, little is known about the extent to which distinct tissue sites in the human head and neck region and proximal respiratory tract selectively permit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. In this translational study, we discover key variabilities in expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), essential SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, among the mucosal tissues of the human proximal airways. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is present in all examined head and neck tissues, with a notable tropism for the nasal cavity and tracheal mucosa. Finally, we uncover an association between smoking and higher SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in the human proximal airway, which may explain the increased susceptibility of smokers to developing severe COVID-19. This is at least partially explained by differences in interferon (IFN)-β1 levels between smokers and non-smokers.

Abstract: Summary
Gut colonization with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria enhances the risk of bloodstream infections in susceptible individuals. We demonstrate highly variable degrees of ex vivo colonization resistance against a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in human feces samples and subsequently isolate diverse K. oxytoca strains from protected donors. Several of these K. oxytoca strains reduce gut colonization of MDR K. pneumoniae strains in antibiotic-treated and gnotobiotic mouse models. Comparative analysis of K. oxytoca strains coupled with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of casA, a protein essential for utilization of selected beta-glucosides, identified competition for specific carbohydrates as key in promoting colonization resistance. In addition to direct competition between K. oxytoca and K. pneumoniae, cooperation with additional commensals is required to reestablish full colonization resistance and gut decolonization. Finally, humanized microbiota mice generated from K. pneumoniae-susceptible donors are protected by K. oxytoca administration, demonstrating the potential of commensal K. oxytoca strains as next-generation probiotics.

Abstract: We explore the role of miR-125b in septic cardiomyopathy, focusing on miR-125b/STAT3/HMGB1 axis. CLP mouse model and LPS-stimulated primary rat cardiomyocytes (CMs) and H9C2 cell were used as in vivo and in vitro models of septic cardiomyopathy, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to measure expression levels of miR-125b, STAT3, HMGB1, and autophagy-related proteins. MTT assay was employed to examine LPS toxicity. Dual luciferase activity assay and CHIP were performed to validate interactions of miR-125b/STAT3 and STAT3/HMGB1 promoter. Immunostaining was used to assess the level of autophagic flux. ROS level was measured by fluorescence assay. Heart functions were examined via intracoronary Doppler ultrasound. miR-125b was diminished while STAT3 and HMGB1 were elevated in the heart tissue following CLP surgery and in LPS-treated H9C2 cells. LPS treatment up-regulated ROS generation and suppressed autophagic flux. Overexpression of miR-125b mimics or knockdown of STAT3 or HMGB1 alleviated LPS-induced hindrance of autophagic flux and ROS production. miR-125b directly targeted STAT3 mRNA and STAT3 bound with HMGB1 promoter. Overexpression of miR-125b mitigated myocardial dysfunction induced by CLP in vivo. Hyperactivation of STAT3/HMGB1 caused by reduced miR-125b contributes to ROS generation and the hindrance of autophagic flux during septic cardiomyopathy, leading to myocardial dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Postnatal brain neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) cluster in anatomically inaccessible stem cell niches, such as the subependymal zone (SEZ). Here, we describe a method for the isolation of NSPCs from live animals, which we term “milking.” The intracerebroventricular injection of a release cocktail, containing neuraminidase, integrin-β1-blocking antibody, and fibroblast growth factor 2, induces the controlled flow of NSPCs in the cerebrospinal fluid, where they are collected via liquid biopsies. Isolated cells retain key in vivo self-renewal properties and their cell-type profile reflects the cell composition of their source area, while the function of the niche is sustained even 8 months post-milking. By changing the target area more caudally, we also isolate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from the corpus callosum. This novel approach for sampling NSPCs and OPCs paves the way for performing longitudinal studies in experimental animals, for more in vivo relevant cell culture assays, and for future clinical neuro-regenerative applications.

Abstract: Summary
To estimate a study design's power to detect differential abundance, we require a framework that simulates many multi-sample single-cell datasets. However, current simulation methods are challenging for large-scale power analyses because they are computationally resource intensive and do not support easy simulation of multi-sample datasets. Current methods also lack modeling of important inter-sample variation, such as the variation in the frequency of cell states between samples that is observed in single-cell data. Thus, we developed single-cell POwer Simulation Tool (scPOST) to address these limitations and help investigators quickly simulate multi-sample single-cell datasets. Users may explore a range of effect sizes and study design choices (such as increasing the number of samples or cells per sample) to determine their effect on power, and thus choose the optimal study design for their planned experiments.

Abstract: Summary
We present predictive models for comprehensive systems analysis of Clostridioides difficile, the etiology of pseudomembranous colitis. By leveraging 151 published transcriptomes, we generated an EGRIN model that organizes 90% of C. difficile genes into a transcriptional regulatory network of 297 co-regulated modules, implicating genes in sporulation, carbohydrate transport, and metabolism. By advancing a metabolic model through addition and curation of metabolic reactions including nutrient uptake, we discovered 14 amino acids, diverse carbohydrates, and 10 metabolic genes as essential for C. difficile growth in the intestinal environment. Finally, we developed a PRIME model to uncover how EGRIN-inferred combinatorial gene regulation by transcription factors, such as CcpA and CodY, modulates essential metabolic processes to enable C. difficile growth relative to commensal colonization. The C. difficile interactive web portal provides access to these model resources to support collaborative systems-level studies of context-specific virulence mechanisms in C. difficile.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a dramatic global impact on public health and social and economic infrastructures. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of an intradermal (i.d.)-delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800, currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and induced spike antigen and RBD binding antibodies with ADCP and ADCD activity. Sera from the animals neutralized both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype viruses. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T cell and neutralizing antibody responses. These responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system, which are likely important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale spiking and field potentials of the rodent hippocampus encode spatial representations during maze runs, immobility, and sleep. Here, we show that multisite hippocampal field potential amplitude at ultra-high-frequency band (FPAuhf), a generalized form of multiunit activity, provides not only a fast and reliable reconstruction of the rodent's position when awake, but also a readout of replay content during sharp-wave ripples. This FPAuhf feature may serve as a robust real-time decoding strategy from large-scale recordings in closed-loop experiments. Furthermore, we develop unsupervised learning approaches to extract low-dimensional spatiotemporal FPAuhf features during run and ripple periods and to infer latent dynamical structures from lower-rank FPAuhf features. We also develop an optical flow-based method to identify propagating spatiotemporal LFP patterns from multisite array recordings, which can be used as a decoding application. Finally, we develop a prospective decoding strategy to predict an animal's future decision in goal-directed navigation.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. The progression of MM is closely related to the bone microenvironment. Bone matrix proteins are remodeled and manipulated to govern cancer growth during the process of MM. However the role of normal bone extracellular matrix in MM is still unclear. In this study the decellularized extracellular matrix derived from normal SD rats’ skulls (N-dECM) was prepared by decellularization technology. The CCK 8 assay and the dead-live cell kit assay were used to determine the viability of MM cells and the sensitivity to bortezomib. The Realtime PCR and Western blot assay were used to assay the mRNA and protein related to MM. Under the treatment of N-dECM, we found that the viability of MM cells was inhibited and the sensitivity of MM cells to bortezomib was increased. Additionally, the expression levels of APRIL and TACI, which participated in the progression of MM, were significantly decreased in MM cells. It suggested that N-dECM might inhibit the development of MM via APRIL-TACI axis, and our study may provide a novel and potential biomaterial for MM therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Calreticulin (CALR) mutations are driver mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), leading to activation of the thrombopoietin receptor and causing abnormal megakaryopoiesis. Here, we generated patient-derived CALRins5- or CALRdel52-positive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to establish an MPN disease model for molecular and mechanistic studies. We demonstrated myeloperoxidase deficiency in granulocytic cells derived from homozygous CALR mutant iPSCs, rescued by repairing the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9. iPSC-derived megakaryocytes showed characteristics of primary megakaryocytes such as formation of demarcation membrane system and cytoplasmic pro-platelet protrusions. Importantly, CALR mutations led to enhanced megakaryopoiesis and accelerated megakaryocytic development in a thrombopoietin-independent manner. Mechanistically, our study identified differentially regulated pathways in mutated versus unmutated megakaryocytes, such as hypoxia signaling, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Altogether, we demonstrate key aspects of mutated CALR-driven pathogenesis dependent on its zygosity, and found novel therapeutic targets, making our model a valuable tool for clinical drug screening in MPNs.

Abstract: Summary
The Scandinavian winter-swimming culture combines brief dips in cold water with hot sauna sessions, with conceivable effects on body temperature. We study thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in experienced winter-swimming men performing this activity 2–3 times per week. Our data suggest a lower thermal comfort state in the winter swimmers compared with controls, with a lower core temperature and absence of BAT activity. In response to cold, we observe greater increases in cold-induced thermogenesis and supraclavicular skin temperature in the winter swimmers, whereas BAT glucose uptake and muscle activity increase similarly to those of the controls. All subjects demonstrate nocturnal reduction in supraclavicular skin temperature, whereas a distinct peak occurs at 4:30–5:30 a.m. in the winter swimmers.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryogenesis is a complex process controlled by transcription factors that regulate the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. Transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG, both essential controllers of pluripotency, stemness and early embryo development. Molecular mechanisms controlling OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG during embryogenesis remain unidentified. We show that AhR regulates pluripotency factors and maintains the metabolic activity required for proper embryo differentiation. AhR-lacking embryos (AhR−/−) showed a pluripotent phenotype characterized by a delayed expression of trophectoderm differentiation markers. Accordingly, central pluripotency factors OCT4/POU5F1 and NANOG were overexpressed in AhR−/− embryos at initial developmental stages. An altered intracellular localization of these factors was observed in the absence of AhR and, importantly, Oct4 had an opposite expression pattern with respect to AhR from the two-cell stage to blastocyst, suggesting a negative regulation of OCT4/POU5F by AhR. We propose that AhR is a regulator of pluripotency and differentiation in early mouse embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding brain functions requires detailed knowledge of long-range connectivity through which different areas communicate. A key step toward illuminating the long-range structures is to image the whole brain at synaptic resolution to trace axonal arbors of individual neurons to their termini. However, high-resolution brain-wide imaging requires continuous imaging for many days to sample over 10 trillion voxels, even in the mouse brain. Here, we have developed a sparse imaging and reconstruction tomography (SMART) system that allows brain-wide imaging of cortical projection neurons at synaptic resolution in about 20 h, an order of magnitude faster than previous methods. Analyses of morphological features reveal that single cortical neurons show remarkable diversity in local and long-range projections, with prefrontal, premotor, and visual neurons having distinct distribution of dendritic and axonal features. The fast imaging system and diverse projection patterns of individual neurons highlight the importance of high-resolution brain-wide imaging in revealing full neuronal morphology.

Abstract: Podocyte injury is the hallmark of proteinuric glomerular diseases. Notch3 is neo-activated simultaneously in damaged podocytes and podocyte's progenitor cells of FSGS, indicating a unique role of Notch3. We previously showed that activation of cAMP-PKA pathway alleviated podocyte injury possibly via inhibiting Notch3 expression. However, the mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, Notch3 signaling was significantly activated in ADR-induced podocytes in vitro and in PAN nephrosis rats and patients with idiopathic FSGS in vivo, concomitantly with podocyte dedifferentiation. In cultured podocytes, pCPT-cAMP, a selective cAMP-PKA activator, dramatically blocked ADR-induced activation of Notch3 signaling as well as inhibition of cAMP-PKA pathway, thus alleviating the decreased cell viability and podocyte dedifferentiation. Bioinformatics analysis revealed EP300/CBP, a transcriptional co-activator, as a central hub for the crosstalk between these two signaling pathways. Additionally, CREB/KLF15 in cAMP-PKA pathway competed with RBP-J the major transcriptional factor of Notch3 signaling for binding to EP300/CBP. EP300/CBP siRNA significantly inhibited these two signaling transduction pathways and disrupted the interactions between the above major transcriptional factors. These data indicate a crucial role of EP300/CBP in regulating the crosstalk between cAMP-PKA pathway and Notch3 signaling and modulating the phenotypic change of podocytes, and enrich the reno-protective mechanisms of cAMP-PKA pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Hair cell degeneration is a major cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Hair cells in mammalian cochlea do not spontaneously regenerate, posing a great challenge for restoration of hearing. Here, we establish a robust, high-throughput cochlear organoid platform that facilitates 3D expansion of cochlear progenitor cells and differentiation of hair cells in a temporally regulated manner. High-throughput screening of the FDA-approved drug library identified regorafenib, a VEGFR inhibitor, as a potent small molecule for hair cell differentiation. Regorafenib also promotes reprogramming and maturation of hair cells in both normal and neomycin-damaged cochlear explants. Mechanistically, inhibition of VEGFR suppresses TGFB1 expression via the MEK pathway and TGFB1 downregulation directly mediates the effect of regorafenib on hair cell reprogramming. Our study not only demonstrates the power of a cochlear organoid platform in high-throughput analyses of hair cell physiology but also highlights VEGFR-MEK-TGFB1 signaling crosstalk as a potential target for hair cell regeneration and hearing restoration.

Abstract: Background
Natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a distinct subtype of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with highly aggressive clinical behavior. We aim to investigate the function of Latent transforming growth factor β binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) and complex molecular pathogenesis of this disease.
Methods
NKTCL patients and reactive lymph nodes patients were recruited in this study. The expression of LTBP1 and TGF-β1 was examined using qRT-PCR, Western blot, IHC and ELISA analyses in biopsied tissues and serum from participants and NKTCL cell lines. Cell proliferation was determined using CFSE. Cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated using flow cytometric analyses. The expression of Ki-67, CDK4 and cyclinD1 proteins was measured using Western blot analyses. The roles of LTBP-1/TGF-β1 in EMT program were determined by measuring E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin using Western blot analyses. The effects of LTBP-1 and TGF-β1 on tumor progression in vivo were determined by animal experiments.
Results
LTBP-1 and TGF-β1 levels were elevated in NKTCL tissues and serum. The expression of LTBP-1 was positively correlated with the expression of TGF-β1 in NKTCL tissues. LTBP-1 was overexpressed in NKTCL cells. Knockdown of LTBP-1 suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, induced cell apoptosis, and suppressed EMT program in NKTCL cells. These effects of LTBP-1 knockdown were attenuated after TGF-β1 stimulation. Knockdown of LTBP-1 inhibited NKTCL tumor weight and volume in vivo. Also, stimulation of TGF-β1 attenuated the suppressive effects on tumor growth from sh-LTBP-1. Silencing of LTBP-1 lowered cellular TGF-β1, phosphorylated-Smad2, phosphorlyatd-Smad3, and phosphorylated-p38 and the suppressive effects were reversed after stimulation of TGF-β1.
Conclusion
Our findings suggested that inhibition of LTBP-1/TGF-β1 suppressed the malignant phenotypes of NKTCL cells and tumor growth via inactivating the canonical TGF-β/Smad signaling and p38MAPK signaling.

Abstract: Understanding the cellular behavioral mechanisms underlying memory formation and maintenance in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) culture provides key strategies for achieving stability and robustness of cell differentiation. Here, we show that changes in cell behavior-driven epigenetic memory of hiPSC cultures alter their pluripotent state and subsequent differentiation. Interestingly, pluripotency-associated genes were activated during the entire cell growth phases along with increased active modifications and decreased repressive modifications. This memory effect can last several days in the long-term stationary phase and was sustained in the aspect of cell behavioral changes after subculture. Further, changes in growth-related cell behavior were found to induce nucleoskeletal reorganization and active versus repressive modifications, thereby enabling hiPSCs to change their differentiation potential. Overall, we discuss the cell behavior-driven epigenetic memory induced by the culture environment, and the effect of previous memory on cell lineage specification in the process of hiPSC differentiation.

Abstract: Keloids are benign skin tumors characterized by aggressive growth. To date, there is no exact treatment because little is known about its pathological mechanism. Therefore, it is important to investigate the mechanism of its occurrence and development to identify therapeutic targets. In this study, the expression of Kindlin-2 was higher in keloid fibroblasts (KFs) than in normal skin fibroblasts (NFs). In vitro experiments showed that knocking down Kindlin-2 in KFs could promote cell apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and contractile capability. Western blot results showed that the phosphorylation of Smad3 in KFs was inhibited after knocking down Kindlin-2, inhibiting the activation of the Smad pathway. Moreover, knocking down Kindlin-2 increased the expression of Fas and FasL in KFs, which demonstrated that knocking down Kindlin-2 promoted the activation of the exogenous apoptotic pathway of KFs and then facilitated apoptosis. The above results revealed that knocking down Kindlin-2 in KFs can inhibit the activation of the Smad pathway and promote the activation of the Fas/FasL exogenous apoptosis pathway, thereby altering the cytological function of KFs. Therefore, Kindlin-2 might play an important role in the occurrence and development of keloids and could become a new target to treat keloids.

Abstract: Nuclear trafficking peptide (NTP), a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) composed of 10 amino acids (aa) (RIFIHFRIGC), has potent nuclear trafficking activity. Recently, we established a protein-based cell engineering system by using NTP, but it remained elusive how NTP functions as a CPP with nuclear orientation. In the present study, we identified importin subunit β1 (IMB1) and transportin 1 (TNPO1) as cellular proteins underlying the activity of NTP. These karyopherin nuclear transport receptors were identified as candidate molecules by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, and downregulation of each protein by small interfering RNA significantly reduced NTP activity (P < 0.01). Biochemical analyses revealed that NTP bound directly to both molecules, and the forced expression of an IMB1 fragment (296–516 aa) or TNPO1 fragment (1–297 aa), which both contain binding sites to NTP, reduced nuclear NTP-green fluorescent protein (GFP) levels when it was added to cell culture medium. NTP is derived from viral protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus-1, and Vpr enters the nucleus and exerts pleiotropic functions. Notably, Vpr bound directly to IMB1 and TNPO1, and its function was significantly impaired by the forced expression of the 296–516-aa fragment of IMB1 and 1–297-aa fragment of TNPO1. Interestingly, NTP completely blocked the physical association of Vpr with IMB1 and TNPO1. Although the nuclear localization mechanism of Vpr remains unknown, our data suggest that NTP functions as a novel nuclear localization signal of Vpr.

Abstract: Metastatic recurrence remains a major cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. In this study, we investigated the mechanistic role of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) in CRC metastasis. First, we explored the potential role of NFATc1 in CRC using bioinformatics and hypothesized that NFATc1 might play different roles at different stages of CRC development. Then, we examined the relative expression of NFATc1 in 25 CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and further analyzed the correlation between NFATc1 expression levels and clinical stages in 120 CRC patients. The role of NFATc1 in CRC metastasis and the molecular mechanisms were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our results showed that the expression of NFATc1 was increased in metastatic CRC tissues and positively associated with clinical stages (stage I vs. stage II, III or IV) of CRC. Overexpression of NFATc1 promoted CRC cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, SNAI1 was verified as the direct transcriptional target of NFATc1 and interacted with SLUG to promote EMT. Remarkably, our lung and liver metastasis mouse model demonstrated that NFATc1 overexpression accelerated CRC metastasis, and treatment with FK506, a calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibitor, could suppress CRC metastasis in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that NFATc1 could transcriptionally activate SNAI1, which in turn interacts with SLUG to mediate EMT to promote CRC metastasis. Thus, making NFATc1 a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Although plant roots encounter a plethora of microorganisms in the surrounding soil, at the rhizosphere, plants exert selective forces on their bacterial colonizers. Unlike immune recognition of pathogenic bacteria, the mechanisms by which beneficial bacteria are selected and how they interact with the plant immune system are not well understood. To better understand this process, we studied the interaction of auxin-producing Bacillus velezensis FZB42 with Arabidopsis roots and found that activation of the plant immune system is necessary for efficient bacterial colonization and auxin secretion. A feedback loop is established in which bacterial colonization triggers an immune reaction and production of reactive oxygen species, which, in turn, stimulate auxin production by the bacteria. Auxin promotes bacterial survival and efficient root colonization, allowing the bacteria to inhibit fungal infection and promote plant health. Thus, a feedback loop between bacteria and the plant immune system promotes the fitness of both partners.

Abstract: Summary
The recent development of single-cell multiomics analysis has enabled simultaneous detection of multiple traits at the single-cell level, providing deeper insights into cellular phenotypes and functions in diverse tissues. However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data. Here, we present scMM, a novel deep generative model-based framework for the extraction of interpretable joint representations and crossmodal generation. scMM addresses the complexity of data by leveraging a mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder. The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models, and the proposed approach experimentally discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability. Furthermore, we show that crossmodal generation by scMM leads to more precise prediction and data integration compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the high incidence of male infertility, only 30% of infertile men receive a causative diagnosis. To explore the regulatory mechanisms governing human germ cell function in normal and impaired spermatogenesis (crypto), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (>30,000 cells). We find major alterations in the crypto spermatogonial compartment with increased numbers of the most undifferentiated spermatogonia (PIWIL4+). We also observe a transcriptional switch within the spermatogonial compartment driven by increased and prolonged expression of the transcription factor EGR4. Intriguingly, the EGR4-regulated chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor UTF1 is downregulated at transcriptional and protein levels. This is associated with changes in spermatogonial chromatin structure and fewer Adark spermatogonia, characterized by tightly compacted chromatin and serving as reserve stem cells. These findings suggest that crypto patients are disadvantaged, as fewer cells safeguard their germline’s genetic integrity. These identified spermatogonial regulators will be highly interesting targets to uncover genetic causes of male infertility.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition with significant socio-economic impact that is exacerbated by the rapid increase in population aging, particularly impacting already burdened health care systems of poorly resourced countries. Accumulation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, generated through amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, manifesting in senile plaques, is a well-established neuropathological feature. Aβ plays a key role in driving synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell loss, glial cell activation and oxidative stress associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, the enhanced clearance of Aβ peptide though modulation of the mechanisms that regulate intracellular Aβ metabolism and clearance during AD progression have received major attention. Autophagy, a lysosome-based major proteolytic pathway, plays a crucial role in intracellular protein quality control and has been shown to contribute to the clearance of Aβ peptide. However, to what extent autophagy activity remains upregulated and functional in the process of increasing Aβ neurotoxicity is largely unclear. Here, we investigated the extent of neuronal toxicity in vitro by characterising autophagic flux, the expression profile of key amyloidogenic proteins, and proteins associated with prominent subtypes of the autophagy pathway to dissect the interplay between the engagement of proteolytic pathways and cell death onset in the context of APP overexpression. Moreover, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of a caloric restriction regime in vivo on the modulation of autophagy in specific brain regions. Our results reveal that autophagy is upregulated in the presence of high levels of APP and Aβ and remains heightened and functional despite concomitant apoptosis induction, suggestive of a mismatch between autophagy cargo generation and clearance capacity. These findings were confirmed when implementing a prolonged intermittent fasting (IF) intervention in a model of paraquat-induced neuronal toxicity, where markers of autophagic activity were increased, while apoptosis onset and lipid peroxidation were robustly decreased in brain regions associated with neurodegeneration. This work highlights that especially caloric restriction mimetics and controlled prolonged IF may indeed be a highly promising therapeutic strategy at all stages of AD-associated pathology progression, for a cell-inherent and cell specific augmentation of Aβ clearance through the powerful engagement of autophagy and thereby robustly contributing to neuronal protection.

Abstract: Endothelial cells adapt their functions as a consequence of sensing extracellular substrate stiffness; these alterations allow them to maintain their vascular structure and function. Substrate stiffness-mediated yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) activation plays an important role in mechano-transduction and pro-angiogenic phenotype of endothelial cells, and Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)-Notch1 signaling is closely related to angiogenesis; however, the impact of substrate stiffness-mediated interrelation of these pathways on endothelial cell functions remains elusive. We confirmed that endothelial cells on softer substrates not only elongate cellular aspects but also attenuate YAP activation compared to cells on stiffer substrates. Endothelial cells on softer substrates also upregulate the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2 mRNA expression that is enhanced by VEGF stimulation. We determined that endothelial cells on softer substrates increased Dll4 expression, but not Notch1 expression, via YAP signaling. Moreover, endothelial cells on soft substrates induced not only VEGFRs upregulation but also suppression of pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA expression and the facilitation of anti-coagulant thrombomodulin and pro-coagulant tissue factor mRNA expression. Our results suggest that endothelial cells activate the YAP-Dll4-Notch signaling pathway in response to substrate stiffness and dictate cellular function.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity to bacteria by programing Cas nucleases with RNA guides that recognize and cleave infecting viral genomes. Bacteria and their viruses each encode recombination systems that could repair the cleaved viral DNA. However, it is unknown whether and how these systems can affect CRISPR immunity. Bacteriophage λ uses the Red system (gam-exo-bet) to promote recombination between related phages. Here, we show that λ Red also mediates evasion of CRISPR-Cas targeting. Gam inhibits the host E. coli RecBCD recombination system, allowing recombination and repair of the cleaved DNA by phage Exo-Beta, which promotes the generation of mutations within the CRISPR target sequence. Red recombination is strikingly more efficient than the host’s RecBCD-RecA in the production of large numbers of phages that escape CRISPR targeting. These results reveal a role for Red-like systems in the protection of bacteriophages against sequence-specific nucleases, which may facilitate their spread across viral genomes.

Abstract: Summary
RYBP (Ring1 and YY1 binding protein), an essential component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), plays pivotal roles in development and diseases. However, the roles of Rybp in neuronal development remains completely unknown. In the present study, we have shown that the depletion of Rybp inhibits proliferation and promotes neuronal differentiation of embryonic neural progenitor cells (eNPCs). In addition, Rybp deficiency impairs the morphological development of neurons. Mechanistically, Rybp deficiency does not affect the global level of ubiquitination of H2A, but it inhibits Notch signaling pathway in eNPCs. The direct interaction between RYBP and CIR1 facilitates the binding of RBPJ to Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and consequently activated Notch signaling. Rybp loss promotes CIR1 competing with RBPJ to bind with NICD, and inhibits Notch signaling. Furthermore, ectopic Hes5, Notch signaling downstream target, rescues Rybp-deficiency-induced deficits. Collectively, our findings show that RYBP regulates embryonic neurogenesis and neuronal development through modulating Notch signaling in a PRC1-independent manner.

Abstract: NODAL signaling plays an essential role in vertebrate embryonic patterning and heart development. Accumulating evidences suggest that genetic mutations in TGF-β/NODAL signaling pathway can cause congenital heart disease in humans. To investigate the implication of NODAL signaling in isolated cardiovascular malformation, we have screened 300 non-syndromic CHD cases and 200 controls for NODAL and ACVR1B by Sanger sequencing and identified two rare missense (c.152C > T; p.P51L and c.981 T > A; p.D327E) variants in NODAL and a novel missense variant c.1035G > A; p.M345I in ACVR1B. All these variants are absent in 200 controls. Three-dimensional protein-modelling demonstrates that both p.P51L and p.D327E variations of NODAL and p.M345I mutation of ACVR1B, affect the tertiary structure of respective proteins. Variants of NODAL (p.P51L and p.D327E) and ACVR1B (p.M345I), significantly reduce the transactivation of AR3-Luc, (CAGA)12-Luc and (SBE)4-Luc promoters. Moreover, qRT-PCR results have also deciphered a reduction in the expression of cardiac-enriched transcription factors namely Gata4, Nkx2-5, and Tbx5 in both the mutants of NODAL. Decreased expression of, Gata4, Nkx2-5, Tbx5, and lefty is observed in p.M345I mutant of ACVR1B as well. Additionally, reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 in response to these variants, suggests impaired NODAL signaling and possibly responsible for defective cell fate decision and differentiation of cardiomyocytes leading to CHD phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) with resistance to neutralizing antibodies are threatening to undermine vaccine efficacy. Vaccination and infection have led to widespread humoral immunity against the pandemic founder (Wu-Hu-1). Against this background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent immunization with variant antigens. It is not yet clear whether heterotypic boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin, where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new one, or whether the memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. We show, in macaques immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike, that a single dose of adjuvanted beta variant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein broadens neutralizing antibody responses to heterologous VOCs. Passive transfer of plasma sampled after Wu-Hu-1 spike immunization only partially protects K18-hACE2 mice from lethal challenge with a beta variant isolate, whereas plasma sampled following heterotypic RBD boost protects completely against disease.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin dependent monoallelic expression of genes. Previous studies showed that conversion of primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into naive pluripotency is accompanied by genome-wide loss of methylation that includes imprinted loci. However, the extent of aberrant biallelic expression of imprinted genes is still unknown. Here, we analyze loss of imprinting (LOI) in a large cohort of both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing samples of naive and primed hPSCs. We show that naive hPSCs exhibit high levels of non-random LOI, with bias toward paternally methylated imprinting control regions. Importantly, we show that different protocols used for the primed to naive conversion led to different extents of LOI, tightly correlated to FGF signaling. This analysis sheds light on the process of LOI occurring during the conversion to naive pluripotency and highlights the importance of these events when modeling disease and development or when utilizing the cells for therapy.

Abstract: microRNA-7 (miR-7), a distinct miRNA family member, has been reported to be involved in the biological functions of immune cells. However, the potential role of miR-7 in the CD8+ T cell development remains to be elucidated. In this study, we estimated the potential effects of miR-7 overexpression in the thymic CD8+ SP cell development using miR-7 overexpression mice. Our results showed that compared with those in control wild type (WT) mice, the volume, weight and total cell numbers of thymus in miR-7 overexpression (OE) mice increased significantly. The absolute cell number of CD8+ SP cells in miR-7 OE mice increased and its ability of activation and proliferation enhanced. Futhermore, we clarified that miR-7 overexpression had an intrinsic promote role in CD8+ SP cell development by adoptive cell transfer assay. Mechanistically, the expression level of PIK3R1, a target of miR-7, decreased significantly in CD8+ SP cells of miR-7 OE mice. Moreover, the expression level of phosphorylated (p)-AKT and p-ERK changed inversely and indicating that miR-7 overexpression impaired the balance of AKE and ERK pathways. In summary, our work reveals an essential role of miR-7 in promoting CD8+ SP cell development through the regulation of PIK3R1 and balance of AKT and ERK pathways.

Abstract: Docetaxel could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by targeting microtubules. The extension of cellular microtubules plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. This paper aims to study the distribution and mechanical properties of cytoskeletal proteins with low concentration of docetaxel. MTT assay was used to detect the minimum drug activity concentration of docetaxel on SKOV-3 cells, fluorescence staining was used to analyze the distribution of cytoskeleton proteins, scanning electron microscopy(SEM) was used to observe the morphology of single cells, and atomic force microscopy(AFM) was used to determine the microstructure and mechanical properties of cells. The results showed that the IC10 of docetaxel was 1 ng/ml. Docetaxel can effectively inhibit the formation of cell pseudopodia, hinder the indirectness between cells, reduce the cell extension area, and make the cells malformed. In addition, when AFM analyzes the effects of drugs on cell microstructure and mechanical properties, the average cell surface roughness and cell height are positively correlated with the concentration of docetaxel. Especially when the concentration was 100 ng/ml, the adhesion decreased by 37.04% and Young's modulus increased by 1.57 times compared with the control group. This may be because docetaxel leads to microtubule remodeling and membrane protein aggregation, which affects cell microstructure and increases cell strength, leading to significant changes in the mechanical properties of ovarian cells. This is of great significance to the study of the formation mechanism of tumor cell invasion and migration activities mediated by actin.

Abstract: The classical heat shock response (HSR) with up-regulation of hsp70 in response to warming is often absent in Antarctic marine species. Whilst in Antarctic fish, this is due to a mutation in the gene promoter region resulting in permanent constitutive expression of the inducible form of hsp70; there are further questions as to whether evolution to life below 0°C has resulted in a generalised alteration to the HSR in Antarctic marine invertebrates. However, the number of species investigated to date is limited. In the first evaluation of the HSR in two spirorbid polychaetes Romanchella perrieri and Protolaeospira stalagmia, we show highly variable results of HSR induction depending on warming regimes. These animals were subjected to in situ warming (+ 1°C and + 2°C above ambient conditions) using heated settlement panels for 18 months, and then the HSR was tested in R. perrieri using acute and chronic temperature elevation trials. The classic HSR was not induced in response to acute thermal challenge in this species (2 h at 15 °C) and significant down-regulation of hsp90 occurred during chronic warming at 4°C for 30 days. Analysis of heat shock protein (HSP) genes in a transcriptome study of P. stalagmia, which had been warmed in situ for 18 months, showed up-regulation of HSP70 and HSP90 family members, thus further emphasising the complexity of the response in Antarctic marine species. It is increasingly apparent that the Antarctic HSR has evolved in a species-specific manner to life in the cold.

Abstract: Summary
The minimal genetic requirements for microbes to survive within multiorganism communities, including host-pathogen interactions, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined targeted gene mutagenesis with phenotype-guided genetic reassembly to identify a cooperative network of SPI-2 T3SS effector genes that are sufficient for Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) to cause disease in a natural host organism. Five SPI-2 effector genes support pathogen survival within the host cell cytoplasm by coordinating bacterial replication with Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) division. Unexpectedly, this minimal genetic repertoire does not support STm systemic infection of mice. In vivo screening revealed a second effector-gene network, encoded by the spv operon, that expands the life cycle of STm from growth in cells to deep-tissue colonization in a murine model of typhoid fever. Comparison between Salmonella infection models suggests how cooperation between effector genes drives tissue tropism in a pathogen group.

Abstract: Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in multicellular organisms depends on the maintenance of force-bearing and force-generating cellular structures. Within myofibrillar Z-discs of striated muscle, isoforms of synaptopodin-2 (SYNPO2/myopodin) act as adapter proteins that are engaged in proteostasis of the actin-crosslinking protein filamin C (FLNc) under mechanical stress. SYNPO2 directly binds F-actin, FLNc and α-actinin and thus contributes to the architectural features of the actin cytoskeleton. By its association with autophagy mediating proteins, i.e. BAG3 and VPS18, SYNPO2 is also engaged in protein quality control and helps to target mechanical unfolded and damaged FLNc for degradation. Here we show that deficiency of all SYNPO2-isoforms in myotubes leads to decreased myofibrillar stability and deregulated autophagy under mechanical stress. In addition, isoform-specific proteostasis functions were revealed. The PDZ-domain containing variant SYNPO2b and the shorter, PDZ-less isoform SYNPO2e both localize to Z-discs. Yet, SYNPO2e is less stably associated with the Z-disc than SYNPO2b, and is dynamically transferred into FLNc-containing myofibrillar lesions under mechanical stress. SYNPO2e also recruits BAG3 into these lesions via interaction with the WW domain of BAG3. Our data provide evidence for a role of myofibrillar lesions as a transient quality control compartment essential to prevent and repair contraction-induced myofibril damage in muscle and indicate an important coordinating activity for SYNPO2 therein.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPS) senses all four nucleotides and forms filamentous structures termed cytoophidia in all three domains of life. How CTPS and cytoophidia function in a developmental context, however, remains underexplored. We report that CTPS forms cytoophidia in a subset of cells in the Drosophila midgut. We found that cytoophidia exist in intestinal stem cells (ISC) and enteroblasts in similar proportions. Both refeeding after starvation and feeding with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induce ISC proliferation and elongate cytoophidia. Knockdown of CTPS inhibits ISC proliferation. Remarkably, disruption of CTPS cytoophidia inhibits DSS-induced ISC proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that both the expression level and the filament-form property of CTPS are crucial for intestinal homeostasis in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancers (OVCAs) and endometrial cancers (EMCAs) are associated with platinum resistance and poor survival, representing a clinically unmet need. We hypothesized that dysregulated cell-cycle progression promoted by CCNE1 overexpression would lead to increased sensitivity to low-dose WEE1 inhibition and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibition (WEE1i-ATRi), thereby optimizing efficacy and tolerability. The addition of ATRi to WEE1i is required to block feedback activation of ATR signaling mediated by WEE1i. Low-dose WEE1i-ATRi synergistically decreases viability and colony formation and increases replication fork collapse and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a CCNE1 copy number (CN)-dependent manner. Only upon CCNE1 induction does WEE1i perturb DNA synthesis at S-phase entry, and addition of ATRi increases DSBs during DNA synthesis. Inherent resistance to WEE1i is overcome with WEE1i-ATRi, with notable durable tumor regressions and improved survival in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in a CCNE1-level-dependent manner. These studies demonstrate that CCNE1 CN is a clinically tractable biomarker predicting responsiveness to low-dose WEE1i-ATRi for aggressive subsets of OVCAs/EMCAs.

Abstract: Summary
Temperate phages are pervasive in bacterial genomes, existing as vertically inherited islands termed prophages. Prophages are vulnerable to predation of their host bacterium by exogenous phages. Here, we identify BstA, a family of prophage-encoded phage-defense proteins in diverse Gram-negative bacteria. BstA localizes to sites of exogenous phage DNA replication and mediates abortive infection, suppressing the competing phage epidemic. During lytic replication, the BstA-encoding prophage is not itself inhibited by BstA due to self-immunity conferred by the anti-BstA (aba) element, a short stretch of DNA within the bstA locus. Inhibition of phage replication by distinct BstA proteins from Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Escherichia prophages is generally interchangeable, but each possesses a cognate aba element. The specificity of the aba element ensures that immunity is exclusive to the replicating prophage, preventing exploitation by variant BstA-encoding phages. The BstA protein allows prophages to defend host cells against exogenous phage attack without sacrificing the ability to replicate lytically.

Abstract: Summary
Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is a prevalent surgically treated subset of head and neck cancer with frequent recurrence and poor survival. Immunotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer. However, whether antitumor responses could be fostered by neoadjuvant presurgical immunotherapy remains unclear. Using a Simon’s two-stage design, we present results of a single-arm phase-II trial where 12 patients with stage II-IVA OCSCC received 3 to 4 biweekly doses of 3 mg/kg nivolumab followed by definitive surgical resection with curative intent. Presurgical nivolumab therapy in this cohort shows an overall response rate of 33% (n = 4 patients; 95% CI: 12%–53%). With a median follow up of 2.23 years, 10 out of 12 treated patients remain alive. Neoadjuvant nivolumab is safe, well-tolerated, and is not associated with delays in definitive surgical treatment in this study. This work demonstrates feasibility and safety for incorporation of nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting for OCSCC (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03021993).

Abstract: Summary
Gene therapies using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are among the most promising strategies to treat or even cure hereditary and acquired retinal diseases. However, the development of new efficient AAV vectors is slow and costly, largely because of the lack of suitable non-clinical models. By faithfully recreating structure and function of human tissues, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal organoids could become an essential part of the test cascade addressing translational aspects. Organ-on-chip (OoC) technology further provides the capability to recapitulate microphysiological tissue environments as well as a precise control over structural and temporal parameters. By employing our recently developed retina on chip that merges organoid and OoC technology, we analyzed the efficacy, kinetics, and cell tropism of seven first- and second-generation AAV vectors. The presented data demonstrate the potential of iPSC-based OoC models as the next generation of screening platforms for future gene therapeutic studies.

Abstract: As the new platinum drug oxaliplatin has been widely used in clinical treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), oxaliplatin resistance has become a burning problem. In this study, higher expression of PARP-1 binding protein (PARPBP) was detected in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC (OR-CRC) cells than in non-resistant cells. Further research showed that kinesin family member 18 b (KIF18b) induced the overexpression of PARPBP, sustaining oxaliplatin resistance in OR-CRC cells. Through exploring the PARPBP gene promoter, we found that SP1-recruited DNMT3b methylated PARPBP promoter to suppress transcription in CRC cells, and increased KIF18b attenuated the recruitment of DNMT3b to PARPBP promoter by directly interacting with SP1 in OR-CRC cells. Clinical analysis suggested a positive relationship between KIF18b and PARPBP in CRC tissues and indicated poor prognosis in CRC patients with high level of KIF18b or PARPBP. In summary, KIF18b-induced PARPBP contributes to the resistant phenotype of OR-CRC.

Abstract: There is a strong association between arsenic exposure and lung cancer development, however, the mechanism by which arsenic exposure leads to carcinogenesis is not clear. In our previous study, we observed that when BEAS-2B cells are chronically exposed to arsenic, there is an increase in secreted TGFα, as well as an increase in EGFR expression and activity. Further, these changes were broadly accompanied with an increase in cell migration. The overarching goal of this study was to acquire finer resolution of the arsenic-dependent changes in cell migration, as well as to understand the role of increased EGFR expression and activity levels in the underlying mechanisms of cell migration. To do this, we used a combination of biochemical and single cell assays, and observed chronic arsenic treatment enhancing cell migration by increasing cell speed, cell persistence and cell protrusion length. All three parameters were further increased by the addition of TGFα, indicating EGFR activity is sufficient to enhance those aspects of cell migration. In contrast, EGFR activity was necessary for the increase in cell speed, as it was reversed with an EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, but was not necessary to enhance persistence and protrusion length. From these data, we were able to isolate both EGFR-dependent and –independent features of cell migration that were enhanced by chronic arsenic exposure.

Abstract: Understanding the regulatory mechanism by which cardiomyocyte proliferation transitions to endoreplication and cell cycle arrest during the neonatal period is crucial for identifying proproliferative factors and developing regenerative therapies. We used a transgenic mouse model based on the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system to isolate and characterize cycling cardiomyocytes at different cell cycle stages at a single-cell resolution. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cycling and noncycling cardiomyocytes was performed at postnatal days 0 (P0) and 7 (P7). The FUCCI system proved to be efficient for the identification of cycling cardiomyocytes with the highest mitotic activity at birth, followed by a gradual decline in the number of cycling and mitotic cardiomyocytes during the neonatal period. Cardiomyocytes showed premature cell cycle exit at G1/S shortly after birth and delayed G1/S progression during endoreplication at P7. Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed previously described signaling pathways involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Erbb2 and Hippo/YAP), and maturation-related transcriptional changes during postnatal development, including the metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, we generated transcriptional profiles specific to cell division and endoreplication in cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages that may facilitate the identification of genes important for adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. In conclusion, the FUCCI mouse provides a valuable system to study cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity at single cell resolution that can help to decipher the switch from cardiomyocyte proliferation to endoreplication, and to revert this process to facilitate endogenous repair.

Abstract: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been established as a promising therapeutic target for KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, phase II clinical trials of a FAK inhibitor (Defactinib) have only shown modest antitumor activity. To address this challenge, here we report the use of a FAK-targeting proteolysis targeting chimera (D-PROTAC) to treat KRAS mutant NSCLC. We validated that D-PROTAC could efficiently eliminate FAK protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in KRAS mutant NSCLC A427 cells, causing over 90% degradation at 800 nM. After comparing both in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacies, we demonstrated that D-PRTOAC outperformed Defactinib in inhibiting tumor growth. Specifically, D-PROTAC at 800 nM reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion by ∼80%. Furthermore, a ∼85% suppression of tumor growth was elicited by D-PROTAC when intratumorally administrated at 10 mg/kg in subcutaneous A427-bearing mice. These results thus demonstrate for the first time that PROTACs may serve as promising therapeutic agents for the intractable NSCLC harboring KRAS mutations.

Abstract: Purpose
Increased permeability of retinal capillary endothelial cells is a key feature in the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Precisely why and how diabetes causes dysfunction in retinal capillary endothelial cells is not well understood, making it challenging to explore more advanced therapeutics.
Methods
Cell proliferation was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Ferroptosis was evaluated by measuring lipid reactive oxygen species levels by flow cytometry and determining malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase levels through biochemical assays. Western blot analysis and quantitative PCR were respectively used to check the expression of proteins and RNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the interaction between TRIM46 and GPX4.
Results
High glucose (HG, 25 mM glucose) significantly suppressed cell growth, which could be reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin-1. HG treatment time-dependently induced ferroptosis in human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) and induced TRIM46 expression. Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of TRIM46 decreased cell resistance against HG-induced ferroptosis, whereas knockdown showed the opposite effect. Administration of RSL3, a ferroptosis agonist, was able to reverse the protective effects of TRIM46 silencing. TRIM46 interacted with GPX4, an important enzyme that suppresses ferroptosis, and promoted GPX4 ubiquitination. Furthermore, lentiviral-mediated overexpression ofGPX4 ameliorated the effects of TRIM46 overexpression and conferred protection to cells against HG-induced ferroptosis.
Conclusion
TRIM46 and GPX4 form a regulatory pathway that controls HG-induced ferroptosis of HRCECs. Inhibiting this pathway or sustaining the expression of GPX4 enables cells to resist damage caused by HG. We provide new mechanistic insight into the pathology of DR and identified TRIM46 and GPX4 as two molecular targets for the development of effective drugs for DR treatment.

Abstract: abstract
Dental implant surgery is currently a routine therapy for the repair of missing dentition or dentition defects. Both clinical and basic research have elucidated that oxidative stress caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for various reasons impairs the process of osteointegration after dental implantation. Therefore, the osteogenic micro-environment must be ameliorated to decrease the damage caused by oxidative stress. Selenomethionine (SEMET) has been reported to play an important role in alleviating oxidative stress and accelerating cell viability and growth. However, it remains unclear whether it exerts protective effects on bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) under oxidative stress. In this study, we explored the influence of selenomethionine on the viability and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs under oxidative stress and the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that 1 μM selenomethionine was the optimum concentration for BMSCs under H2O2 stimulation. H2O2-induced oxidative stress suppressed the viability and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, manifested by the increases in ROS production and cell apoptosis rates, and by the decrease of osteogenic differentiation-related markers. Notably, the aforementioned oxidative damage and osteogenic dysfunction induced by H2O2 were rescued by selenomethionine. Furthermore, we found that the PTEN expression level was suppressed and its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway was activated by selenomethionine. However, when PTEN was stimulated, the PI3K/AKT pathway was down-regulated, and the protective effects of selenomethionine on BMSC osteogenic differentiation diminished, while the inhibition of PTEN up-regulated the protective effects of selenomethionine. Together, these results revealed that selenomethionine could attenuate H2O2-induced BMSC dysfunction through an antioxidant effect, modulated via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting that selenomethionine is a promising antioxidant candidate for reducing oxidative stress during the process of dental implant osteointegration.

Abstract: Summary
Bile acids act as signaling molecules that regulate immune homeostasis, including the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into distinct T cell subsets. The bile acid metabolite isoallolithocholic acid (isoalloLCA) enhances the differentiation of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg cells) by facilitating the formation of a permissive chromatin structure in the promoter region of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Here, we identify gut bacteria that synthesize isoalloLCA from 3-oxolithocholic acid and uncover a gene cluster responsible for the conversion in members of the abundant human gut bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes. We also show that the nuclear hormone receptor NR4A1 is required for the effect of isoalloLCA on Treg cells. Moreover, the levels of isoalloLCA and its biosynthetic genes are significantly reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, suggesting that isoalloLCA and its bacterial producers may play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis in humans.

Abstract: Summary
The circulating metabolome provides unique insights into multiple sclerosis (MS) pathophysiology, but existing studies are relatively small or characterized limited metabolites. We test for differences in the metabolome between people with MS (PwMS; n = 637 samples) and healthy controls (HC; n = 317 samples) and assess the association between metabolomic profiles and disability in PwMS. We then assess whether metabolic differences correlate with changes in cellular gene expression using publicly available scRNA-seq data and whether identified metabolites affect human immune cell function. In PwMS, we identify striking abnormalities in aromatic amino acid (AAA) metabolites (p = 2.77E−18) that are also strongly associated with disability (p = 1.01E−4). Analysis of scRNA-seq data demonstrates altered AAA metabolism in CSF and blood-derived monocyte cell populations in PwMS. Treatment with AAA-derived metabolites in vitro alters monocytic endocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. We identify shifts in AAA metabolism resulting in the reduced production of immunomodulatory metabolites and increased production of metabotoxins in PwMS.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cell logic gates hold great potential for wide-ranging applications. However, most of those currently available are controlled by drug(-like) molecules with inherent biological activities. To construct truly orthogonal circuits and artificial regulatory pathways, biologically inert molecules are ideal molecular switches. Here, we applied genetic code expansion and engineered logic gates controlled by two biologically inert unnatural amino acids. Genetic code expansion relies on orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs for co-translational and site-specific unnatural amino acid incorporation conventionally in response to an amber (UAG) codon. By screening 11 quadruplet-decoding pyrrolysyl tRNA variants from the literature, we found that all variants decoding CUAG or AGGA tested here are functional in mammalian cells. Using a quadruplet-decoding orthogonal pair together with an amber-decoding pair, we constructed logic gates that can be successfully controlled by two different unnatural amino acids, expanding the scope of genetic code expansion and mammalian cell logic circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiome succession affects infant development. However, it remains unclear what factors promote persistence of initial bacterial colonizers in the developing gut. Here, we perform strain-resolved analyses to compare gut colonization of preterm and full-term infants throughout the first year of life and evaluate associations between strain persistence and strain origin as well as genetic potential. Analysis of fecal metagenomes collected from 13 full-term and 9 preterm infants reveals that infants’ initially distinct microbiomes converge by age 1 year. Approximately 11% of early colonizers, primarily Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, persist during the first year of life, and those are more prevalent in full-term, compared with preterm infants. Examination of 17 mother-infant pairs reveals maternal gut strains are significantly more likely to persist in the infant gut than other strains. Enrichment in genes for surface adhesion, iron acquisition, and carbohydrate degradation may explain persistence of some strains through the first year of life.

Abstract: Summary
With the recent advancements in genome editing, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and scalable cloning techniques, scientists can now conduct genetic screens at unprecedented levels of scale and precision. With such a multitude of technologies, there is a need for a simple yet comprehensive pipeline to enable systematic mammalian genetic screening. In this study, we develop unique algorithms for target identification and a toxin-less Gateway cloning tool, termed MegaGate, for library cloning which, when combined with existing genetic perturbation methods and NGS-coupled readouts, enable versatile engineering of relevant mammalian cell lines. Our integrated pipeline for sequencing-based target ascertainment and modular perturbation screening (STAMPScreen) can thus be utilized for a host of cell state engineering applications.

Abstract: Radiation-induced gastric injury is a serious adverse effect and reduces the efficacy of radiotherapy treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced stomach injury remain unclear. Here, mouse stomach and gastric epithelial cells were irradiated with different doses of X-ray radiation. The results showed that radiation induced gastric injury in vivo and in vitro. Differentially expressed functional mRNAs in irradiation-induced gastric tissues were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We found that the expression of microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 1 (Mast1) was downregulated in mouse gastric tissues and gastric epithelial cells after irradiation. Furthermore, functional assays showed that knockdown of Mast1 inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells, while overexpression of Mast1 protected gastric epithelial cells from radiation damage. Mechanistically, Mast1 negatively regulated radiation-induced injury in gastric epithelial cells by inhibiting the activation of P38. The apoptosis caused by knockdown of Mast1 in gastric epithelial cells could be partially reversed by the P38 inhibitor SB203580. Moreover, data from several gastric cancer cell lines and online databases revealed that Mast1 was not involved in the development of gastric cancer. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Mast1 is essential for radiation-induced gastric injury, providing a promising prognostic and therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting disease progression remains a particularly challenging endeavor in chronic degenerative disorders and cancer, thus limiting early detection, risk stratification, and preventive interventions. Here, profiling the three chronic subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we identify the blood platelet transcriptome as a proxy strategy for highly sensitive progression biomarkers that also enables prediction of advanced disease via machine-learning algorithms. The MPN platelet transcriptome reveals an incremental molecular reprogramming that is independent of patient driver mutation status or therapy. Subtype-specific markers offer mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and highlight impaired proteostasis and a persistent integrated stress response. Using a LASSO model with validation in two independent cohorts, we identify the advanced subtype MF at high accuracy and offer a robust progression signature toward clinical translation. Our platelet transcriptome snapshot of chronic MPNs demonstrates a proof-of-principle for disease risk stratification and progression beyond genetic data alone, with potential utility in other progressive disorders.

Abstract: INTS6 (integrator complex subunit 6) has been reported as a tumor suppressor in many cancers. However, the expression and biological function of INTS6 in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been investigated yet. In this study, we found that INTS6 expression was significantly increased in CRC tissues when compared with normal tissues and was associated with poor prognosis. Downregulation of INTS6 induced G1/S-phase cell cycle arrest, and markedly suppressed the growth of CRC cells and the derived tumors, while overexpression of INTS6 showed opposite effect. Mechanism study revealed that INTS6 increased the levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and ERK (p-ERK), and the growth-promoting effect of INTS6 was inhibited by AKT and ERK inhibitors. Besides, INTS6 also affected the expression of two targets of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling, c-Myc and CDK2, which contributed to cell cycle alteration. Altogether, the present study has revealed the oncogenic role of INTS6 in CRC, providing a novel therapeutic target for this malignant cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The specification of inhibitory neurons has been described for the mouse and human brain, and many studies have shown that pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be used to create interneurons in vitro. It is unclear whether in vitro methods to produce human interneurons generate all the subtypes found in brain, and how similar in vitro and in vivo interneurons are. We applied single-nuclei and single-cell transcriptomics to model interneuron development from human cortex and interneurons derived from PSCs. We provide a direct comparison of various in vitro interneuron derivation methods to determine the homogeneity achieved. We find that PSC-derived interneurons capture stages of development prior to mid-gestation, and represent a minority of potential subtypes found in brain. Comparison with those found in fetal or adult brain highlighted decreased expression of synapse-related genes. These analyses highlight the potential to tailor the method of generation to drive formation of particular subtypes.

Abstract: Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used for chemotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) but the drug resistance limits its therapeutic benefit. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1 (HNRNPUL1) belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and is involved in DNA damage repair. To investigate whether and how HNRNPUL1 affects CDDP resistance of ESCC, we evaluated the expression of HNRNPUL1 and found that it was associated with recurrence in ESCC patients receiving postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy and was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS). Besides, we showed that the reduced expression of HNRNPUL1 enhanced the CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq) were performed and a range of HNRNPUL1-binding RNAs influenced by CDDP treatment were identified followed by bioinformatics analysis. In terms of mechanism, we found that HNRNPUL1 inhibited CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells by regulating the CDDP sensitivity-inhibited circular RNA (circRNA) MAN1A2 formation. Taken together, our results first demonstrated the role of HNRNPUL1 in CDDP resistance of ESCC and suggested that HNRNPUL1 may be a potential target of ESCC chemotherapy.

Abstract: Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) is a member of the class A scavenger receptor family which is expressed on the cell surface of macrophages. It is well known that MARCO avidly binds to unopsonized pathogens, leading to its ingestion by macrophages. However, the role of MARCO in the recognition and phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages remains poorly understood. In this study, we used lentiviral technology to knockdown and overexpress MARCO and investigated the ability of macrophages to phagocytose tumor cells. Our results showed that MARCO expression was correlated with the ability of macrophages to carry on phagocytosis. MARCO knockdown led to significant decreases in the number of engulfment pseudopodia of macrophages and inhibition of the phagocytosis of tumor cells. On the other hand, MARCO overexpression elevated activity of SYK, PI3K and Rac1 in macrophages, which led to changes in macrophage morphology and enhanced phagocytosis by promoting formation of stress fibers and pseudopodia. By Co-IP analysis we showed that MARCO directly binds to the β5 integrin of SL4 tumor cells. In summary, these results demonstrated the important role for MARCO in demonstrated tumor cells uptake and clearance by macrophages.

Abstract: Aging is an inescapable complex physiological but extendable process, and all cells, including stem cells, are altered over time. Diverse mechanism(s) could modulate stem cell number, their proliferation rate, and promote tissue repair during aging that leads to longevity. However, the factors that could restore aging stem cell potency and would lead to healthy aging are not fully identified. Here we show that maintaining cytosolic Ca2+ levels was essential for modulating stem cells function in aged mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Increasing external Ca2+ induced spindle shape stem cell morphology and maintained stem cell surface marker expression in aged bone marrow-derived MSCs. Similarly, stem cell survival and proliferation of aged MSCs was dependent on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Importantly, Ca2+ entry potentiated cell cycle progression, and stem cell potential was increased in cells incubated with higher external Ca2+. Moreover, blocking Ca2+ entry using SKF 96365, decreased stem cell survival and its proliferation but, treatment with 2-APB did not significantly affected cell proliferation, rather only modulated cell viability. Evaluation of Ca2+ entry channels, showed that TRPC1/Orai1/Orai3 and their regulator STIM1 was essential for MSCs proliferation/viability as gene silencing of Orai1/Orai3/TRPC1/STIM1 significantly inhibited stem cell viability. Finally, MSCs isolated from aged mice that were subjected to higher Ca2+ levels, were able to rescue age-induced loss of MSCs function. Together these results suggest that Ca2+ entry is essential for preventing the loss of aged stem cell function and supplementing Ca2+ not only restored their proliferative potential but, allowed them to develop into younger stem cell lineages that could be critical for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic neoplasms. The progression of malignancy is closely associated with immune regulation. Macrophages are indispensable tissue components and have been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of hematopoietic malignancies. However, the specific role of macrophages in the development of MDS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the characteristics and phenotypic evolution of macrophages from patients with MDS. Macrophages from patients with MDS expressed CD68, CD86 and CD163. Furthermore, MDS macrophages exhibited more M2-related characteristics. Moreover, a number of phenotype-associated genes in MDS macrophages exhibited diverse responses to iron overload or iron chelation upon stimulation by ferric chloride or deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator). Ferric chloride polarized MDS macrophages to exhibit more M1-related characteristics, a phenomenon that could be partially reversed by DFO. Therefore, this study reveals the characteristics and phenotypic evolution of MDS macrophages and broadens the knowledge of macrophage plasticity in hematopoietic malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
To accurately segment cell edges and quantify cellular morphodynamics from live-cell imaging data, we developed a deep learning-based pipeline termed MARS-Net (multiple-microscopy-type-based accurate and robust segmentation network). MARS-Net utilizes transfer learning and data from multiple types of microscopy to localize cell edges with high accuracy. For effective training on distinct types of live-cell microscopy, MARS-Net comprises a pretrained VGG19 encoder with U-Net decoder and dropout layers. We trained MARS-Net on movies from phase-contrast, spinning-disk confocal, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes. MARS-Net produced more accurate edge localization than the neural network models trained with single-microscopy-type datasets. We expect that MARS-Net can accelerate the studies of cellular morphodynamics by providing accurate pixel-level segmentation of complex live-cell datasets.

β-Adrenergic signaling blockade is a mainstay of hypertension management. One percent of patients taking β-blockers develop reduced salivary gland (SG) function. Here we investigate the role of SG progenitor cells in β-blocker-induced hyposalivation, using human SG organoid cultures (SGOs). Compared with control SGs, initial low SG progenitor cell yield from patients taking β-blockers was observed. When passaged, these SGOs recovered self-renewal and upregulated Notch pathway expression. Notch signaling was downregulated in situ in β-adrenergic receptor-expressing luminal intercalated duct (ID) cells of patients taking β-blockers. Control SGOs treated with β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol demonstrated increased proportion of luminal ID SGO cells with active Notch signaling. Control SGOs exposed to isoproterenol differentiated into more mature SGOs (mSGOs) expressing markers of acinar cells. We propose that β-blocker-induced Notch signaling reduction in luminal ID cells hampers their ability to proliferate and differentiate into acinar cells, inducing a persistent hyposalivation in some patients taking β-blocking medication.

Abstract: Summary
We propose a new concept that human somatic cells can be converted to become male germline stem cells by the defined factors. Here, we demonstrated that the overexpression of DAZL, DAZ2, and BOULE could directly reprogram human Sertoli cells into cells with the characteristics of human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), as shown by their similar transcriptomes and proteomics with human SSCs. Significantly, human SSCs derived from human Sertoli cells colonized and proliferated in vivo, and they could differentiate into spermatocytes and haploid spermatids in vitro. Human Sertoli cell-derived SSCs excluded Y chromosome microdeletions and assumed normal chromosomes. Collectively, human somatic cells could be converted directly to human SSCs with the self-renewal and differentiation potentials and high safety. This study is of unusual significance, because it provides an effective approach for reprogramming human somatic cells into male germ cells and offers invaluable male gametes for treating male infertility.

Abstract: Background & aims
Mature hepatocytes have limited expansion capability in culture and rapidly loose key functions. Recently however, tissue culture conditions have been developed that permit rodent hepatocytes to proliferate and transform into progenitor-like cells with ductal characteristics in vitro. Analogous cells expressing both hepatic and duct markers can be found in human cirrhotic liver in vivo and may represent an expandable population.
Methods
An in vitro culture system to expand epithelial cells from human end stage liver disease organs was developed by inhibiting the canonical TGF-β, Hedgehog and BMP pathways.
Results
Human cirrhotic liver epithelial cells became highly proliferative in vitro. Both gene expression and DNA methylation site analyses revealed that cirrhosis derived epithelial liver cells were intermediate between normal hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Mouse hepatocytes could be expanded under the same conditions and retained the ability to re-differentiate into hepatocytes upon transplantation. In contrast, human cirrhotic liver derived cells had only low re-differentiation capacity.
Conclusions
Epithelial cells of intermediate ductal-hepatocytic phenotype can be isolated from human cirrhotic livers and expanded in vitro. Unlike their murine counterparts they have limited liver repopulation potential.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic carcinoma is rare and has a poorer prognosis than thymomas. The treatment options are limited after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. We previously performed a single-center phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced thymic carcinoma, showing a 22.5% response rate. Here, we characterize the genomic and transcriptomic profile of thymic carcinoma samples from 10 patients (5 non-responders versus 5 responders) in this cohort, with the main aim of identifying potential predictors of response to immunotherapy. We find that expression of PDL1 and alterations in genes or pathways that correlated with PD-L1 expression (CYLD and BAP1) could be potential predictors for response or resistance to immunotherapy in patients with advanced thymic carcinoma. Our study provides insights into potential predictive markers/pathways to select patients with thymic carcinoma for anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The determination of endometrial carcinoma histological subtypes, molecular subtypes, and mutation status is critical for the diagnostic process, and directly affects patients’ prognosis and treatment. Sequencing, albeit slower and more expensive, can provide additional information on molecular subtypes and mutations that can be used to better select treatments. Here, we implement a customized multi-resolution deep convolutional neural network, Panoptes, that predicts not only the histological subtypes but also the molecular subtypes and 18 common gene mutations based on digitized H&E-stained pathological images. The model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well on independent datasets. Our results suggest that Panoptes, with further refinement, has the potential for clinical application to help pathologists determine molecular subtypes and mutations of endometrial carcinoma without sequencing.

Abstract: Somatosensory low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) sense innocuous mechanical forces, largely through specialized axon termini termed sensory nerve endings, where the mechanotransduction process initiates upon activation of mechanotransducers. In humans, a subset of sensory nerve endings is enlarged, forming bulb-like expansions, termed bulbous nerve endings. There is no in vitro human model to study these neuronal endings. Piezo2 is the main mechanotransducer found in LTMRs. Recent evidence shows that Piezo1, the other mechanotransducer considered absent in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), is expressed at low level in somatosensory neurons. We established a differentiation protocol to generate, from iPSC-derived neuronal precursor cells, human LTMR recapitulating bulbous sensory nerve endings and heterogeneous expression of Piezo1 and Piezo2. The derived neurons express LTMR-specific genes, convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals and have specialized axon termini that morphologically resemble bulbous nerve endings. Piezo2 is concentrated within these enlarged axon termini. Some derived neurons express low level Piezo1, and a subset co-express both channels. Thus, we generated a unique, iPSCs-derived human model that can be used to investigate the physiology of bulbous sensory nerve endings, and the role of Piezo1 and 2 during mechanosensation.

Abstract: Formation of osteoclasts is known to be closely associated with osteoporosis progression. LOX is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of collagen, which is the new mediator in osteoclast formation. However, the effect of LOXG473A on of osteoclast formation needs to be explored. Thereby, we sought to explore the effect of LOXG473A on formation of osteoclasts and its underlying mechanism. To investigate the function of LOXG473A in osteoclast formation, Raw264.7 cells were stably transfected with LOX-WT or LOX-MUT (LOXG473A). Real-time PCR and western blotting were used to detect the relative levels of osteoclast formation related genes and proteins. TRAP staining and immunofluorescence staining were used to test the ability of Raw264.7 cells to form osteoclasts and the ability of cells to form rings, respectively. Bone erosion assay was used to test bone resorptive activity. The data indicated that LOXG473A significantly enhanced the ability of osteoclasts forming, ring-forming and bone resorpting in Raw264.7 cells. Mechanically, LOXG473A upregulated the expressions of NFATC1, ACP5, CTSK, IL-6, and the proportion of p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3, thereby promoting the formation of osteoclasts. In conclusion, we have verified that LOXG473A induces the proliferation of osteoclasts in Raw264.7 cells via IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, suggesting a novel strategy for studying osteoporosis.

Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the parameters of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant protection, biochemical parameters, and cortisol and adrenaline content in the blood of students depending on the effect of exam stress. A total of 135 healthy students (72 female (53.3%) and 63 male (46.7%)) aged from 19 to 21 years (mean age 20.16±0.42 years) of the experimental group underwent detailed medical screening and examination before the inclusion in the study. The control group consisted of 30 healthy students (17 female (56.7%) and 13 male (43.3%)) of corresponding age (mean age 20.23±0.54 years), whose medical examination was performed during breaks in the absence of any stress factors. The blood parameters of the experimental group were investigated 1 h before, 1 h after, and 24 h after the exam. The cortisol content in the blood of experimental group students significantly increased 1.37 times (p < 0.05) an hour before the exam and 1.32 times (p < 0.05) an hour after; adrenalin content in blood increased 1.76 times (p < 0.05) and 1.49 times (p < 0.05), respectively. Compared to the control group, intensification of lipid peroxidation processes with a 1.51-fold (p < 0.05) increase in erythrocyte malonic aldehyde content in blood 1 h before and 1.42-fold (p < 0.05) increase an hour after the exam was observed in students due to the effect of exam stress.. Changes in hormonal homeostasis, activation of lipoperoxidation processes with the development of oxidative stress, and the disintegration of antioxidant protection factors are typical for academic stress in students.

Abstract: Summary
In Parkinson’s disease (PD), substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons degenerate, while related ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons remain relatively unaffected. Here, we present a methodology that directs the differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cells toward either SN- or VTA-like DA lineage and models their distinct vulnerabilities. We show that the level of WNT activity is critical for the induction of the SN- and VTA-lineage transcription factors Sox6 and Otx2, respectively. Both WNT signaling modulation and forced expression of these transcription factors can drive DA neurons toward the SN- or VTA-like fate. Importantly, the SN-like lineage enriched DA cultures recapitulate the selective sensitivity to mitochondrial toxins as observed in PD, while VTA-like neuron-enriched cultures are more resistant. Furthermore, a proteomics approach led to the identification of compounds that alter SN neuronal survival, demonstrating the utility of our strategy for disease modeling and drug discovery.

Abstract: Regulatory T (Treg) cells are thought to contribute to tumor pathogenesis by suppressing tumor immunosurveillance and antitumor immunity. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells are a recently characterized Treg subset that expresses both the Treg transcription factor (TF) Foxp3 and the T follicular helper (Tfh) TF Bcl-6. The role of Tfr cells in glioma patients remains unclear. In this study, we found that the level of Tfr cells, identified as Foxp3+Bcl-6+ CD4 T cells, was significantly elevated in tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells from resected glioma tumors. Both Tfr cells and Treg cells significantly suppressed the proliferation and the cytotoxic capacity of CD8 T cells toward glioma tumor cells, and the suppression was positively associated with the proportion of Tfr cells and Treg cells, respectively. Tfr and Treg cells from glioma tumor samples demonstrated higher suppression potency than those from healthy blood samples and glioma blood samples. Interestingly, canonical CXCR5- Treg cells could suppress both CXCR5+ and CXCR5- CD8 T cells, albeit with stronger potency toward CXCR5- CD8 T cells. However, Tfr cells presented much higher suppression potency toward CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, whereas CXCR5+ CD8 T cells are a potent CD8 T cell subset previously described to have antiviral and antitumor roles. Overall, these data indicate that Tfr cells are enriched in glioma tumors and have suppressive capacity toward CD8 T cell-mediated effector functions.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic mutations in KRAS can be recognized by T cells on specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) molecules, leading to tumor control. To date, the discovery of T cell targets from KRAS mutations has relied on occasional T cell responses in patient samples or the use of transgenic mice. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a systematic target discovery and validation pipeline. We evaluate the presentation of mutant KRAS peptides on individual HLA-I molecules using targeted mass spectrometry and identify 13 unpublished KRASG12C/D/R/V mutation/HLA-I pairs and nine previously described pairs. We assess immunogenicity, generating T cell responses to nearly all targets. Using cytotoxicity assays, we demonstrate that KRAS-specific T cells and T cell receptors specifically recognize endogenous KRAS mutations. The discovery and validation of T cell targets from KRAS mutations demonstrate the potential for this pipeline to aid the development of immunotherapies for important cancer targets.

Abstract: Summary
Heart failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following myocardial infarction. Cardiac remuscularization with transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is a promising preclinical therapy to restore function. Recent large animal data, however, have revealed a significant risk of engraftment arrhythmia (EA). Although transient, the risk posed by EA presents a barrier to clinical translation. We hypothesized that clinically approved antiarrhythmic drugs can prevent EA-related mortality as well as suppress tachycardia and arrhythmia burden. This study uses a porcine model to provide proof-of-concept evidence that a combination of amiodarone and ivabradine can effectively suppress EA. None of the nine treated subjects experienced the primary endpoint of cardiac death, unstable EA, or heart failure compared with five out of eight (62.5%) in the control cohort (hazard ratio = 0.00; 95% confidence interval: 0–0.297; p = 0.002). Pharmacologic treatment of EA may be a viable strategy to improve safety and allow further clinical development of cardiac remuscularization therapy.

Abstract: Summary
We here demonstrate that microsatellite (MS) alterations are elevated in both mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but importantly we have now identified a type of human iPSC in which these alterations are considerably reduced. We aimed in our present analyses to profile the InDels in iPSC/ntESC genomes, especially in MS regions. To detect somatic de novo mutations in particular, we generated 13 independent reprogramed stem cell lines (11 iPSC and 2 ntESC lines) from an identical parent somatic cell fraction of a C57BL/6 mouse. By using this cell set with an identical genetic background, we could comprehensively detect clone-specific alterations and, importantly, experimentally validate them. The effectiveness of employing sister clones for detecting somatic de novo mutations was thereby demonstrated. We then successfully applied this approach to human iPSCs. Our results require further careful genomic analysis but make an important inroad into solving the issue of genome abnormalities in iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Whether clinically important responses and adverse events (AEs) are dependent on the route of administration has not been determined. We demonstrate that nearly identical exposure-response pharmacodynamic relationships are determined by plasma semaglutide levels achieved through oral versus injectable administration for changes in HbA1c, body weight, biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, and AEs such as nausea and vomiting. At typical exposure levels for oral semaglutide, the estimated response is 1.58% (oral) versus −1.62% (subcutaneous) for HbA1c and 3.77% (oral) versus 3.48% (subcutaneous) reduction in body weight relative to baseline after 6 months. Increased body weight is the most important variable associated with reduced semaglutide exposure for both formulations. Hence, interindividual variation in GLP-1R responsivity or route of administration are not major determinants of GLP-1RA effectiveness in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular interactions at identical transcriptomic locations or at proximal but non-overlapping sites can mediate RNA modification and regulation, necessitating tools to uncover these spatial relationships. We present nearBynding, a flexible algorithm and software pipeline that models spatial correlation between transcriptome-wide tracks from diverse data types. nearBynding can process and correlate interval as well as continuous data and incorporate experimentally derived or in silico predicted transcriptomic tracks. nearBynding offers visualization functions for its statistics to identify colocalizations and adjacent features. We demonstrate the application of nearBynding to correlate RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding preferences with other RBPs, RNA structure, or RNA modification. By cross-correlating RBP binding and RNA structure data, we demonstrate that nearBynding recapitulates known RBP binding to structural motifs and provides biological insights into RBP binding preference of G-quadruplexes. nearBynding is available as an R/Bioconductor package and can run on a personal computer, making correlation of transcriptomic features broadly accessible.

Abstract: Defensins are highly conserved antimicrobial peptides, which ubiquitously expressed in different species. In addition to the functions in host defense, their aberrant expression have also been documented in cancerous tissue including breast cancer, lung caner and renal carcinoma etc. Whereas, roles of Defensin Alpha 5 (DEFA5) in colon cancer has not been explored. Bioinformatic analysis was used to study the expression of DEFA5 and its correlation with clinical outcomes; Western blot, qPCR, Co-immunoprecipitation, xenograft models were used to the study the molecular mechanism. Decreased expression of DEFA5 at protein level was observed in colon tissues. Colon cancer cell lines proliferation and colony formation capacity were significantly suppressed by DEFA5 overexpression. Moreover, in vivo tumor growth in nude mice was also suppressed by DEFA5 overexpression, suggesting a tumor suppressor role of DEFA5 in colon cancer. Mechanistically, DEFA5 directly binds to the subunits of PI3K complex, thus attenuates the downstream signaling transduction, leads to delayed cell growth and metastasis. Collectively, we concluded that DEFA5 showed an inhibitory effect in colon cancer cell growth and may serve as a potential tumor suppressor in colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The immature characteristics and metabolic phenotypes of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) restrict their applications for disease modeling, drug discovery, and cell-based therapy. Leveraging on the metabolic shifts from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation as CMs mature, a human hexokinase1-GFP metabolic reporter cell line (H7 HK1-GFP) was generated to facilitate the isolation of fetal or more matured hPSC-CMs. RNA sequencing of fetal versus more matured CMs uncovered a potential role of interferon-signaling pathway in regulating CM maturation. Indeed, IFN-γ-treated CMs resulted in an upregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which was found to be associated with increased expression of CM maturation genes, shift from MYH6 to MYH7 expression, and improved sarcomeric structure. Functionally, IFN-γ-treated CMs exhibited a more matured electrophysiological profile, such as increased calcium dynamics and action potential upstroke velocity, demonstrated through calcium imaging and MEA. Expectedly, the functional improvements were nullified with a JAK-STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib.

Abstract: Summary
Immune suppression by CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and tumor infiltration by CD8+ effector T cells represent two major factors impacting response to cancer immunotherapy. Using deconvolution-based transcriptional profiling of human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and other solid cancers, we demonstrate that the density of Treg cells does not correlate with that of CD8+ T cells in many tumors, revealing polarized clusters enriched for either CD8+ T cells or CD4+ Treg and conventional T cells. In a mouse model of carcinogen-induced OSCC characterized by CD4+ T cell enrichment, late-stage Treg cell ablation triggers increased densities of both CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells within oral lesions. Notably, this intervention does not induce tumor regression but instead induces rapid emergence of invasive OSCCs via an effector T cell-dependent process. Thus, induction of a T cell-inflamed phenotype via therapeutic manipulation of Treg cells may trigger unexpected tumor-promoting effects in OSCC.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation has been reported to exert protective effects on podocytes, whereas angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) has been shown to exert significant pathogenic effects on these cells. This study aimed to investigate the link between the protective effects of PPARα activation and the pathogenic effects of ANGPTL3 in podocytes. Both PPARα and ANGPTL3 were expressed in cultured podocytes. PPARα mRNA and protein levels decreased whereas ANGPTL3 mRNA and protein levels increased in a time-dependent manner in podocytes treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Gemfibrozil, a pharmacological agonist of PPARα, increased PPARα levels and activity in podocytes. The drug also decreased ANGPTL3 levels by potentially weakening ANGPTL3 promoter activity in both normal and PAN-treated podocytes. Furthermore, gemfibrozil significantly decreased PAN-induced apoptosis and F-actin rearrangement. Primary podocytes from Angptl3-knockout mice were cultured. There was no significant difference between Angptl3−/− podocytes treated with or without gemfibrozil in the lamellipodia numbers after PAN treatment. The results suggested that the protective effects of gemfibrozil on podocytes were not exerted following knockout of the Angptl3 gene. This study identified a novel mechanism of the PPARα agonist gemfibrozil that exerts its protective effects by inhibiting PAN-induced apoptosis and cytoskeleton rearrangements through inhibition of ANGPTL3 expression.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) function as molecular chaperones in multiple physiological processes and are active during thermal stress. sHSP expression is controlled by heat shock transcription factor (HSF); however, few studies have been conducted on HSF in agricultural pests. Liriomyza trifolii is an introduced insect pest of horticultural and vegetable crops in China. In this study, the master regulator, HSF1, was cloned and characterized from L. trifolii, and the expression levels of HSF1 and five sHSPs were studied during heat stress. HSF1 expression in L. trifolii generally decreased with rising temperatures, whereas expression of the five sHSPs showed an increasing trend that correlated with elevated temperatures. All five sHSPs and HSF1 showed an upward trend in expression with exposure to 40 ℃ without a recovery period. When a recovery period was incorporated after thermal stress, the expression patterns of HSF1 and sHSPs in L. trifolii exposed to 40°C was significantly lower than expression with no recovery period. To elucidate potential interactions between HSF1 and sHSPs, double-stranded RNA was synthesized to knock down HSF1 in L. trifolii by RNA interference. The knockdown of HSF1 by RNAi decreased the survival rate and expression of HSP19.5, HSP20.8, and HSP21.3 during high-temperature stress. This study expands our understanding of HSF1-regulated gene expression in L. trifolii exposed to heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
Frontotemporal dementia type 3 (FTD3), caused by a point mutation in the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), affects mitochondrial ultrastructure and the endolysosomal pathway in neurons. To dissect the astrocyte-specific impact of mutant CHMP2B expression, we generated astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and confirmed our findings in CHMP2B mutant mice. Our data provide mechanistic insights into how defective autophagy causes perturbed mitochondrial dynamics with impaired glycolysis, increased reactive oxygen species, and elongated mitochondrial morphology, indicating increased mitochondrial fusion in FTD3 astrocytes. This shift in astrocyte homeostasis triggers a reactive astrocyte phenotype and increased release of toxic cytokines, which accumulate in nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) pathway activation with increased production of CHF, LCN2, and C3 causing neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside at the apex of the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy and sustain multilineage hematopoiesis. Here, we show that the transcriptional regulator CITED2 is essential for life-long HSC maintenance. While hematopoietic-specific Cited2 deletion has a minor impact on steady-state hematopoiesis, Cited2-deficient HSCs are severely depleted in young mice and fail to expand upon aging. Moreover, although they home normally to the bone marrow, they fail to reconstitute hematopoiesis upon transplantation. Mechanistically, CITED2 is required for expression of key HSC regulators, including GATA2, MCL-1, and PTEN. Hematopoietic-specific expression of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 partially rescues the Cited2-deficient HSC pool and restores their reconstitution potential. To interrogate the Cited2→Pten pathway in HSCs, we generated Cited2;Pten compound heterozygous mice, which had a decreased number of HSCs that failed to reconstitute the HSC compartment. In addition, CITED2 represses multiple pathways whose elevated activity causes HSC exhaustion. Thus, CITED2 promotes pathways necessary for HSC maintenance and suppresses those detrimental to HSC integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Population genomics of bulk malaria infections is unable to examine intrahost evolution; therefore, most work has focused on the role of recombination in generating genetic variation. We used single-cell sequencing protocol for low-parasitaemia infections to generate 406 near-complete single Plasmodium vivax genomes from 11 patients sampled during sequential febrile episodes. Parasite genomes contain hundreds of de novo mutations, showing strong signatures of selection, which are enriched in the ApiAP2 family of transcription factors, known targets of adaptation. Comparing 315 P. falciparum single-cell genomes from 15 patients with our P. vivax data, we find broad complementary patterns of de novo mutation at the gene and pathway level, revealing the importance of within-host evolution during malaria infections.

Abstract: Summary
In rodents, lower brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity is associated with greater liver steatosis and changes in the gut microbiome. However, little is known about these relationships in humans. In adults (n = 60), we assessed hepatic fat and cold-stimulated BAT activity using magnetic resonance imaging and the gut microbiota with 16S sequencing. We transplanted gnotobiotic mice with feces from humans to assess the transferability of BAT activity through the microbiota. Individuals with NAFLD (n = 29) have lower BAT activity than those without, and BAT activity is inversely related to hepatic fat content. BAT activity is not related to the characteristics of the fecal microbiota and is not transmissible through fecal transplantation to mice. Thus, low BAT activity is associated with higher hepatic fat accumulation in human adults, but this does not appear to have been mediated through the gut microbiota.

Abstract: Ad-apoptin is a recombinant oncolytic adenovirus constructed by our laboratory that can express apoptin. It can selectively kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. This study investigated the effects of Ad-apoptin on glycolysis, migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Glycolysis was investigated by glucose consumption, lactic acid production and glycolytic key enzyme protein levels. Migration and invasion were evaluated via wound healing, transwell assays and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) protein levels. The interaction between apoptin and AMPK was detected by Co-IP. A nude mice tumor model was established to investigate the anti-cancer role of Ad-apoptin in vivo. The results showed that Ad-apoptin inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis of A549 and NCI–H23 cells. Ad-apoptin can reduce the glucose uptake and lactic production in lung cancer cells, and reduce the expression of related glycolysis-limiting enzymes. At the same time, Ad-apoptin inhibited the migration and invasion of lung cancer. Immunoprecipitation showed that apoptin and AMPK could interact directly. Moreover, knockdown of AMPK significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of Ad-apoptin on glycolysis, migration and invasion of A549 and NCI–H23 cells. Ad-apoptin can inhibit the growth of tumors in nude mice. Compared with the control group, Ad-apoptin had a significant inhibitory effect on AMPK knockdown tumors. The immunohistochemical results of tumor tissues were consistent with those in vitro. Collectively, Ad-apoptin targets AMPK and inhibits glycolysis, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. This suggests that Ad-apoptin may have therapeutic potential for lung cancer by targeting AMPK activation.

Abstract: Angiogenesis has been certified to account for tumor pathobiology. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in angiogenesis-related diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the regulatory roles of most circRNAs remain obscure. This study aims to uncover the function of hsa_circ_0004018 on angiogenesis in HCC. Firstly, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analyzed that circ_0004018 was definitely down-regulated in HCC. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the protein level of fused protein in sarcoma (FUS) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (TIMP2). Functional assays were carried out to assess the impacts of circ_0004018 on HCC. From the experimental results, we found that overexpression of circ_0004018 significantly inhibited angiogenesis in HCC. The regulatory mechanism of circ_0004018 in HCC was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Therefore, we proved that estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mediated circ_0004018 regulated TIMP2 by recruiting FUS. A series of rescue assays verified that circ_0004018 participated in angiogenesis in HCC via modulating TIMP2. In summary, this paper disclosed that ESR1 activated circ_0004018 inhibited angiogenesis in HCC via binding to FUS and stabilizing TIMP2 expression.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form from preexisting vessels and regulates the processes of embryonic development, wound healing and tumorigenesis. HMGA2 is involved in the occurrence of several cancers, but its biological role and the exact downstream genes involved in vascular development and sprouting angiogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we first found that HMGA2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos resulted in defects of central artery formation. RNA sequencing revealed that IGFBP2 was significantly downregulated by interference with HMGA2, and IGFBP2 overexpression reversed the inhibition of brain vascular development caused by HMGA2 deficiency. In vitro, we further found that HMGA2 knockdown blocked the migration, tube formation and branching of HUVECs. Similarly, IGFBP2 protein overexpression attenuated the impairments induced by HMGA2 deficiency. Moreover, the promotion of angiogenesis by HMGA2 overexpression was verified in a Matrigel plug assay. We next found that HMGA2 bound directly to a region in the IGFBP2 promoter and positively regulated IGFBP2 expression. Interestingly, the mRNA expression levels of HMGA2 and IGFBP2 were increased significantly in the peripheral blood of hemangioma patients, indicating that overexpression of HMGA2 and IGFBP2 results in vessel formation, consistent with the results of the in vivo and in vitro experiments. In summary, our findings demonstrate that HMGA2 promotes central artery formation by modulating angiogenesis via IGFBP2 induction.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the microbiota and mammalian host are essential for defense against infection, but the microbial-derived cues that mediate this relationship remain unclear. Here, we find that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-associated commensal bacteria, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), promote early protection against the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, independent of CD4+ T cells. SFB induced histone modifications in IECs at sites enriched for retinoic acid receptor motifs, suggesting that SFB may enhance defense through retinoic acid (RA). Consistent with this, inhibiting RA signaling suppressed SFB-induced protection. Intestinal RA levels were elevated in SFB mice, despite the inhibition of mammalian RA production, indicating that SFB directly modulate RA. Interestingly, RA was produced by intestinal bacteria, and the loss of bacterial-intrinsic aldehyde dehydrogenase activity decreased the RA levels and increased infection. These data reveal RA as an unexpected microbiota-derived metabolite that primes innate defense and suggests that pre- and probiotic approaches to elevate RA could prevent or combat infections.

Abstract: Some discoveries resulted from 2-dimensional (2D) cultured cardiac cells have been disqualified in animal testing and later clinical trials. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in cardiac homeostasis, cardiac ECM (cECM)-based 3D cell cultures can mimics the physiological and pathological conditions in vivo closely, it is hopeful of addressing this challenge. Construction of cECM-based 3-dimensional (3D) hydrogel (cECM3DH) and its effects on cell behaviors were studied here. The results indicated that cellular compartments could be efficiently removed from heart tissue via sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS)- and Triton X-100-mediated decellularization, remaining the natural fibrous network structure and major proteins. 3D hydrogel consisted of 1 × 107 cells/mL cells and 75% cECM could promote the proliferation and anti-apoptosis ability of human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells. 0.25% trypsin or 0.20% collagenase was suitable to retrieve these cells from 3D hydrogel for further researches. Compared with 2D culture system, cECM3DH could significantly increase the proportion of GATA 4+ cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from heart tissue of neonatal mouse or induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (P < 0.05) The expression levels of mature genes including cTnT, JCN, CaV1.2, MYL2, CASQ2, NCX1, and Cx43 of these CMs in adult pig cECM-based 3D hydrogel (APcECM3DH) were significantly higher than that in 2D culture system and in newborn piglet cECM-based 3D hydrogel (NPcECM3DH), respectively (P < 0.05). Therefore, cECM3DH supports the generation of primary CMs and ESC-derived CMs, APcECM3DH was more conducive to promoting CM maturation, which contributes to building 3D model for pathogenesis exploration, drug screening, and regenerative medicine of heart diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Fukutin-related protein (FKRP) is a glycosyltransferase involved in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG). Mutations in FKRP are associated with muscular dystrophies (MD) ranging from limb-girdle LGMDR9 to Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS), a severe type of congenital MD. Although hypoglycosylation of α-DG is the main hallmark of this group of diseases, a full understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is still missing. Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms impaired by FKRP mutations in pluripotent stem (PS) cell–derived myotubes. FKRP-deficient myotubes show transcriptome alterations in genes involved in extracellular matrix receptor interactions, calcium signaling, PI3K-Akt pathway, and lysosomal function. Accordingly, using a panel of patient-specific LGMDR9 and WWS induced PS cell–derived myotubes, we found a significant reduction in the autophagy-lysosome pathway for both disease phenotypes. In addition, we show that WWS myotubes display decreased ERK1/2 activity and increased apoptosis, which were restored in gene edited myotubes. Our results suggest the autophagy-lysosome pathway and apoptosis may contribute to the FKRP-associated MD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Various molecular and cellular processes are involved in renal fibrosis, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial cell injury, and apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are implicated in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was to evaluate changes in urine and serum HSP levels over time and their relationships with the clinical parameters of CKD in children. In total, 117 children with CKD and 56 healthy children were examined. The CKD group was followed up prospectively for 24 months. Serum and urine HSP27, HSP40, HSP47, HSP60, HSP70, HSP72, and HSP90 levels and serum anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP70 levels were measured by ELISA at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. The urine levels of all HSPs and the serum levels of HSP40, HSP47, HSP60, HSP70, anti-HSP60, and anti-HSP70 were higher at baseline in the CKD group than in the control group. Over the months, serum HSP47 and HSP60 levels steadily decreased, whereas HSP90 and anti-HSP60 levels steadily increased. Urine HSP levels were elevated in children with CKD; however, with the exception of HSP90, they decreased over time. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that CKD progression is a complicated process that involves HSPs, but they do not predict CKD progression. The protective role of HSPs against CKD may weaken over time, and HSP90 may have a detrimental effect on the disease course.

Abstract: Summary
p53 alterations occur during culture of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), but the significance of these events on epigenetic control of PSC fate determination remains poorly understood. Wdr5 deletion in p53-null (DKO) mouse ESCs (mESCs) leads to impaired self-renewal, defective retinal neuroectoderm differentiation, and de-repression of germ cell/meiosis (GCM)-specific genes. Re-introduction of a WDR5 mutant with defective H3K4 methylation activity into DKO ESCs restored self-renewal and suppressed GCM gene expression but failed to induce retinal neuroectoderm differentiation. Mechanistically, mutant WDR5 targets chromatin that is largely devoid of H3K4me3 and regulates gene expression in p53-null mESCs. Furthermore, MAX and WDR5 co-target lineage-specifying chromatin and regulate chromatin accessibility of GCM-related genes. Importantly, MAX and WDR5 are core subunits of a non-canonical polycomb repressor complex 1 responsible for gene silencing. This function, together with canonical, pro-transcriptional WDR5-dependent MLL complex H3K4 methyltransferase activity, highlight how WDR5 mediates crosstalk between transcription and repression during mESC fate choice.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic application of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derivatives requires comprehensive assessment of the integrity of their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to exclude oncogenic potential and functional deficits. It is unknown, to which extent mtDNA variants originate from their parental cells or from de novo mutagenesis, and whether dynamics in heteroplasmy levels are caused by inter- and intracellular selection or genetic drift. Sequencing of mtDNA of 26 iPSC clones did not reveal evidence for de novo mutagenesis, or for any selection processes during reprogramming or differentiation. Culture expansion, however, selected against putatively actionable mtDNA mutations. Altogether, our findings point toward a scenario in which intracellular selection of mtDNA variants during culture expansion shapes the mutational landscape of the mitochondrial genome. Our results suggest that intercellular selection and genetic drift exert minor impact and that the bottleneck effect in context of the mtDNA genetic pool might have been overestimated.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) has the potential to revolutionize immunotherapy of infectious diseases and cancer. However, the generation of defined TCR-transgenic T cell medicinal products with predictable in vivo function still poses a major challenge and limits broader and more successful application of this “living drug.” Here, by studying 51 different TCRs, we show that conventional genetic engineering by viral transduction leads to variable TCR expression and functionality as a result of variable transgene copy numbers and untargeted transgene integration. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TCR replacement enables defined, targeted TCR transgene insertion into the TCR gene locus. Thereby, T cell products display more homogeneous TCR expression similar to physiological T cells. Importantly, increased T cell product homogeneity after targeted TCR gene editing correlates with predictable in vivo T cell responses, which represents a crucial aspect for clinical application in adoptive T cell immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) are stem cells responsible for muscle development and regeneration. Although CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used, its application in endogenous SCs remains elusive. Here, we generate mice expressing Cas9 in SCs and achieve robust editing in juvenile SCs at the postnatal stage through AAV9-mediated short guide RNA (sgRNA) delivery. Additionally, we reveal that quiescent SCs are resistant to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate efficient editing of master transcription factor (TF) Myod1 locus using the CRISPR/Cas9/AAV9-sgRNA system in juvenile SCs. Application on two key TFs, MYC and BCL6, unveils distinct functions in SC activation and muscle regeneration. Particularly, we reveal that MYC orchestrates SC activation through regulating 3D genome architecture. Its depletion results in strengthening of the topologically associating domain boundaries thus may affect gene expression. Altogether, our study establishes a platform for editing endogenous SCs that can be harnessed to elucidate the functionality of key regulators governing SC activities.
