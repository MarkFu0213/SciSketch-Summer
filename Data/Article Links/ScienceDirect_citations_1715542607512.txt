Abstract: Reducing the amount of electricity used by cooling systems is essential for lowering CO2 emissions; therefore suppressing increases in room temperature in an environmentally friendly manner requires the development of heat-shielding materials that autonomously control sunlight without the use of electricity. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) has attracted attention as a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) type of temperature-responsive polymer. HPC is a thermochromic material that changes its optical properties in response to changes in external temperature. In this study, acrylamide (AAm) and HPC with various molecular weights were used to prepare HPC-AAm hydrogels, and their optical, heat-shielding, and weathering-resistant properties were evaluated. UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy revealed that the solar transmittance (αTsol) of the HPC-AAm hydrogel decreased while its solar reflectance (αRsol) increased with increasing HPC concentration above LCST. The αTsol of low-molecular-weight HPC was found to be lower than that of high-molecular-weight HPC. In addition, the temperature inside a box constructed using an HPC-AAm hydrogel window was approximately 10 °C lower than that constructed using glass alone. Furthermore, the optical properties of the HPC-AAm hydrogel were found to hardly deteriorated even when continuously exposed to heat and UV radiation for 150 h. Therefore, the HPC-AAm hydrogel prepared in this study is expected to be useful as a heat-shielding material.

Abstract: The need of a higher role of solar energy within the energy mix in the coming decades obliges the collectors to increase their performance and reliability. It is demanded that the solar absorbers, as the key component of solar thermal collectors, should be low cost with high efficiency for extended lifetimes under different kinds of environments. Commercially, there are presently two main types of solutions as selective solar absorbers coatings for low temperature applications: coatings obtained by physical vapour deposition (PVD) and by paint coatings (PC). These coatings present different physical and chemical characteristics. Therefore, it is important to know how these commercial coatings degrade over time in different environments. Results obtained with two different PVD coatings and three PC, under different accelerated aging tests, are presented. The aging tests performed included different environmental stress corrosion conditions: temperature, humidity, chlorides, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The chlorides and the gases SO2 and NO2 affect distinctly the different selective coatings. Cyclic variation of corrosion promoting gases (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide), higher humidity, salt spraying and drying seem to be an aging test that reflects the different environments where the solar thermal collectors are exposed. In addition to the contaminants, drying/wetting cycles also play an important role in degradation mechanisms of absorber coatings. So, the international standard ISO 22975-3 needs to be revised to include cyclic conditions with these contaminants.

Abstract: CdTe is the second most-widely deployed photovoltaic (PV) material due to its high efficiency and low manufacturing costs. Currently, polycrystalline CdTe (poly-CdTe) has a record efficiency of ~22%, which is still well below the theoretical limit (~30%). Polycrystalline CdTe films that have incorporated Cl or Se show higher efficiency, possibly due to the segregation of these ions to the grain boundaries (GBs), where they may passivate the dangling bonds. However, the efficiency enhancement mechanisms of passivants in CdTe GBs, and the feasibility of employing alternative passivants, have not been well explored. Here, we present a systematic computational study of CdTe GBs with potential passivants, namely S, P, As, Se, and Sb on Te sites, and Na, Mg, Al, Sc, Cu, and Zn on Cd sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on GB dislocation core structures derived from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of a model GB (bicrystal). We computed the segregation thermodynamics, electronic density of states, and charge variations near doped CdTe GBs. We find that segregation of impurities to GBs is thermodynamically favorable. For a Te-terminated core, Se, S, and P on Te sites effectively reduce midgap states. For both Cd- and Te- terminated dislocation cores, Sc and Al reduce midgap states when substituted for Cd atoms. The greatest improvement was achieved with co-doping, i.e. simultaneously substituting Te with Se and substituting Cd with Cu or Al. The elimination of midgap states is predicted to increase the photovoltaic efficiency of CdTe by reducing the recombination at grain boundaries.

Abstract: Background
Carica papaya Linn. has high nutraceutical and pharmacological values. The leaves possess antimicrobial, anti-tumor and antioxidant properties. They are used to treat thrombocytopenia during dengue fever and the leaf extract is commercially available as tablets under the name Caripill™ (MicroLabs, Bengaluru). Nevertheless, platelet transfusion is recommended in severe cases of thrombocytopenia, but the platelet storage is limited to 5–7 days at 22−24°C. Reducing oxidative stress (OS) during platelet storage might help in prolonging the shelf-life, since the OS is known to cause platelet storage lesion. Hence, this study investigated the effects of Caripill™ as an additive in Tyrode’s buffer during extended platelet storage.
Methods
Platelets isolated from 4 months old male Wistar rats were stored with Caripill™ (50 and 100μg/ml) at 22°C for 12 days. Platelet functional and metabolic markers and various OS markers were analyzed on days 0, 4, 8 and 12.
Results
Caripill™ (50 and 100μg/ml) maintained platelet functions and lactate dehydrogenase, elevated nitrites, reduced glucose consumption, protected proteins and up-regulated the antioxidant enzymes. However, the CP100 up-regulated catalase from day 4, elevated nitrites from day 8, prevented the formation of secondary products of lipid peroxidation and increased the total antioxidant capacity on day 4.
Conclusions
Caripill™ reduced platelet storage lesion up to day 8 of storage. Results suggest that a higher concentration of Caripill™ was more effective in combating the oxidative damage during platelet storage. This study throws light on the beneficial effects of Caripill™ in combating oxidative stress during platelet storage.

Abstract: Nanoparticle Enhanced Ionic Liquids (NEILs) are the new heat transfer fluids for direct absorption solar collectors and are comprised of small vol/wt percentage of nanoparticles in base ionic liquids (ILs). In the present paper, NEILs are synthesized by dispersing Al2O3 nanoparticles in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylimide ([C4mim][NTf2]) ILs. The radiative properties of NEILs are investigated with different sizes and shapes (one rod-shaped type sized 10 × 100nm and four spherical sizes of 10 nm, 30 nm, 60 nm, and 90 nm) of Al2O3 nanoparticles. Five different concentrations (0.02%, 0.04%, 0.06%, 0.08%, and 0.1% wt) of NEILs were synthesized to investigate the concentration effect on radiative properties. The addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles greatly increased the light absorption capabilities of the ionic liquid [C4mim][NTf2], with at least a 26% decrease in transmittance observed with only 0.02% wt of nanoparticles. Differences in UV–vis absorption were more apparent in smaller concentrations; as much as 20% difference between nanoparticle types and larger concentrations varied in transmittance by as little as 5% between nanoparticle types. Nanofluids made of rod-shaped nanoparticles typically generated higher percentage transmittance values in 0.02%, 0.04%, and 0.06% wt of nanoparticles and were therefore less able to absorb light. Nanofluids made of 10 nm spherical nanoparticles yielded smaller percentage transmittance values at higher concentrations, as little as 2.7% transmission at 0.1% wt, and were therefore better able to absorb light. After completing the nanoparticle size and shape studies, three more NEILs were created from the ideal nanoparticle size and concentration in [C2mim][NTf2], [C6mim][NTf2], and [C10mim][NTf2] ILs. This investigation revealed an increase in percentage transmittance with increasing carbon chain length. [C2mim][NTf2] was determined to be the best-absorbing NEILs transmitting as little as 2.2% of light. Plausible reasons for the experimental results are discussed.

Abstract: Se-rich selenization offers remarkable benefits for grain growth of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber layers, which is critical for solar cells fabrication. However, low-activity selenium often forms Se-clusters and trapped in CZTSSe absorber layers. These trapped Se-clusters increase carrier recombination in CZTSSe absorber layers, thus decreasing efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells. Herein, supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) treatment was demonstrated to regulate selenium composition of CZTSSe absorber layers for solar cells efficiency improvement. Compared with untreated CZTSSe absorber layers, selenium composition of CZTSSe absorber layers were significantly reduced by SCCO2 treatment. The open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of CZTSSe solar cells improved pronouncedly due to carrier recombination reduction and carrier transport enhancement. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased from 9.26 % (ref device) to 11.43 % (SCCO2 device). This unique SCCO2 treatment may offer new ideas for other selenization-based optoelectronic devices performance improvement.

Abstract: Due to its unique properties, such as long carrier diffusion length and adjustable optical band gap, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite has been a potentially strong photoelectric material for solar cells. However, the challenge of insufficient stability of perovskite materials has not been solved, which in turn, limits its commercial application. Inspired by the strong stability of C3N2H5PbI3 (ImPbI3), we present an innovative doped system, Im(1-x)CsxPbI3 (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), based on the cation-doped strategy, to obtain both strong stability and excellent photoelectric performance. A new perovskite phase ImPbI3 is proposed and verified rationality of existence through formation energy, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), mean square displacement (MSD), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For analyzing the photoelectric properties of Im(1-x)CsxPbI3, the bandgap, charge distribution of the frontier molecular orbital, and projected density of states are investigated. To study the stability of Im(1-x)CsxPbI3, geometric configuration, tolerance factor, crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP), and AIMD simulations are performed. The results show that the perovskite phase ImPbI3 has strong thermodynamic stability and structural stability, and its optical bandgap value is lower than that of the hexagonal system. When the content of doped Cs does not exceed 50%, the stability of the perovskite phase ImPbI3 is significantly improved. Comprehensive analysis shows that Im0.5Cs0.5PbI3 exhibits encouraging performance with strong stability and high optical absorption coefficient. This theoretical study opens a new avenue for the design of robust organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with strong stability and excellent photoelectric performance based on our findings from perovskite phase ImPbI3 system.

Abstract: We describe the optimization of an ultra-thin silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) layer deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as an interfacial layer for phosphorus doped polysilicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts. Our results demonstrate the possibility of depositing the thin interfacial layer and the intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) film in a single PECVD process. We found that the gas flow rates strongly influence the properties of the SiOxNy layers, such as the refractive indices, chemical bond compositions and structural stabilities, which significantly affect the properties of the resulting polysilicon passivating contact structures. The passivation quality initially increased and then decreased with a decreasing N2O/SiH4 flow ratio, in the gas flow range of uniform deposition, while the contact resistivity decreased significantly. We found an optimal gas flow ratio of N2O:SiH4:N2 = 25:9:361, with which we obtained uniform polysilicon passivating contacts with a high implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 711 mV and a low contact resistivity ρc of 6.6 mΩ cm2.

Abstract: Photochromic devices (PC) are considered as ideal candidates for integrated building applications because of their ability to control light and heat transfer into/out of building inner spaces without any external power supply. However, several issues restrict their practical application, including long-term stability concerns due to the volatile nature of the commonly used liquid electrolyte, the high replacement/installation cost associated with their rigid device architecture, and an extremely slow bleaching speed during reversion to their original state due to the lack of an external stimulus such as electricity. The present study aimed to resolve these bottlenecks. Firstly, we exploited a highly stable and conductive polymer-gel electrolyte based on UV-curable trivalent acrylate instead of using organic liquid-based electrolytes. Secondly, we explored a low-temperature UV-curing procedure to deposit the chromogenic WO3 and TiO2 layers, suitable for fabricating a flexible PC device. Finally, a catalytic amount of Pt nanoparticles was successfully incorporated on the surface of the WO3 layer using an identical UV-curing route, which was found to significantly enhances the bleaching speed of the resulting PC device. Thanks to the combined positive effects, the fabricated PC device displayed a deep contrast in coloration (approximately 60 %), unprecedented bleaching kinetic with 90 % recovery of its original transmittance value within 45 min in the dark condition, and prolonged long-term operation for over 1000 coloration-bleaching cycles. These results open way to making efficient PCs for not only smart windows but also for other bendable or wearable applications.

Abstract: The gasochromic processes of switchable mirrors based on a Mg–Y alloy were studied by measuring the change in volume concentration (vol%) of H2 in the air gaps of a mirrored cell using a residual gas analyzer. The change in the optical transmittance of the mirrors and the relative humidity in the gaps during the processes were measured simultaneously. An important factor for developing a practical switching system, which helps realize a fully hydrogenated state without water condensation, is to control the vol% of H2 in the air gap to be 1.0%.

Abstract: Objectives
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) both promote osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). IGF-1C, the C domain peptide of IGF-1, and P24, a BMP-2-derived peptide, both have similar biological activities as their parent growth factors. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of polypeptides IGF-1C and P24 on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
Methods
The optimum concentrations of IGF-IC and P24 were explored. The effects of the two polypeptides on BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were examined using a CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity assay, alizarin red S staining, qPCR, and Western blotting. In addition, specific pathway inhibitors were utilized to explore whether the p38 and JNK pathways were involved in this process.
Results
The optimal concentration of both polypeptides was 50 μg/ml. IGF-1C and P24 synergistically promoted BMSC proliferation, increased ALP activity and calcified nodule formation, upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of Osx, Runx2, Ocn, Opn, and Col1a1, and improved the phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK proteins. Inhibition of the pathways significantly reduced p38 and JNK activation and blocked Runx2 expression while inhibiting ALP activity and calcified nodule formation.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that IGF-1C and P24 synergistically promote the osteogenesis of BMSCs through activation of the p38 and JNK signaling pathways.

Abstract: We investigate the effective surface recombination velocity Seff of alkaline textured, Phosphorus-diffused and thermal SiO2/SiNx passivated surfaces with an emphasis on the impact of the thermal oxidation temperature. The application of a recent calibration procedure for the carrier lifetime measurements enables a precise determination of the dark saturation current density. The experimental results include 25 diffusion/oxidation process combinations that cover a wide range of final surface concentration levels Ns between 3⋅1020 cm−3 and 1⋅1019 cm−3, using oxidation temperatures Tox from 650 °C to 900 °C. This yields a data set that enables a revision of the commonly applied parameterization of the effective  surface recombination velocity of this passivation scheme using numerical simulation. In addition, the impact of fixed surface charges is modeled for separating field effect and chemical passivation properties. Also, the role of the oxidation temperature on the passivation quality is investigated.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer recurs despite advances in treatment and is due to drug resistance. The persistence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is one of the causes. It has been challenging to maintain CSCs long term in culture from primary malignant cells. Reprogramming cancer cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be an approach to achieve this. An ovarian cancer cell line, PEO4, was initially reprogrammed into iPSCs using the classical four factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM) using lentivirus transduction. The PEO4-OSKM-cells had all the hallmarks of iPSCs. As MYC is oncogenic, we have replaced it with GLIS1 and show that PEO4 cells could be transformed into iPSCs. The transfection efficiency was two-fold better with OCT4-SOX2-KLF4-GLIS1 (OSKG) with larger colonies. Further, normal fallopian tube epithelial cells were also transformed using OSKG into iPSCs. iPSCs expressed CSCs markers such as CD133, EPHA1, ALDH1A1 and LGR5 prominently and were more resistant to cisplatin and taxol as compared to parental PEO4 cells. PEO4-OSKM-iPSCs cells formed more colonies in a clonogenic assay as compared to PEO4-OSKG-iPSCs and parental cells. These results provide a first insight that both an ovarian cancer cell line and fallopian tube epithelial cells can be reprogrammed and GLIS1 can successfully replace MYC as a transcription factor. This in vitro model is useful for future experiments to understand the characteristics of CSCs in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Direct absorption using a nanofluid is an efficient way of harnessing solar energy. Present works aim to investigate hexagonal boron nitride-ethylene glycol (BN-EG) nanofluids and BN mixed with carbon black (CB) in EG (BN/CB-EG) hybrid nanofluids for applications in direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs). Nanofluids were prepared by using the two-step method. Stability and homogeneity were inspected photographically after storage of one month. The optical properties of the nanofluids were measured and computed under varying concentration mixing ratios (CMRs). An absorbed energy fraction of 98.92% was obtained in a 2.0 cm height of 90 ppm/15 ppm BN/CB nanofluid. Photo-thermal conversion performances of the nanofluids were investigated using a small in-house built experimental collector. Temperature-rises in the working fluids were measured under varying durations of exposure to a fixed irradiance, fluid height, and CMRs of the nanoparticles. An enhancement of 34.55% photo-thermal conversion efficiency over that of EG alone was obtained in the 90 ppm/15 ppm BN/CB nanofluid after 1200 s exposure to 437 W/m2 incident irradiance. Some basic approaches for designing a DASC in an optimized manner are also discussed. It is concluded that BN/CB-EG hybrid nanofluids can be the prospective working fluids in DASCs.

Abstract: Oxidative damage to protein and lipid macromolecules in target organs in hypertension has been recognized as a major factor contributing to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. Data on protein and lipid oxidative damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats are numerous, but there is no information on DNA damage in tissues measured by comet assay. The aim of this study was to determine the baseline damage to DNA, protein, and lipid macromolecules in different organs of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Markers of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage were measured in blood, heart, kidney, and liver of 24-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats. Plasma prooxidant and antioxidant status were determined as well. Age-matched normotensive Wistar rats were used as control. A rise in markers of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, malondialdehyde, and advanced oxidation protein products, was detected in all tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats, with particularly high values in the liver. DNA damage, measured by the comet assay, was significantly higher in all the studied tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to normotensive control, with more severe damage in the cardiac and renal cells. Significant depletion of the plasma antioxidant barrier in spontaneously hypertensive rats was also observed. This study showed increased damage to all macromolecules in all studied samples of spontaneously hypertensive rats in comparison with control Wistar rats.

Abstract: Conventional thermal energy storage (TES) media and heat transfer fluids (HTFs) currently used in commercial concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are nitrate-based molten salts with working temperature up to about 565 °C. Current interest in raising the working temperature in next-generation CSP for higher energy conversion efficiency leads to chloride-based molten salt technology (>700 °C). MgCl2–KCl–NaCl salt is selected to be such a TES/HTF material due to its excellent salt properties, abundance and low costs. In this review, survey and evaluation of its exact eutectic composition by evaluation of the phase diagram as well as most relevant salt properties for design, construction and operation of a test loop and projection of a real TES/HTF system are presented. They include minimum melting temperature, vapor pressure, heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity. The working temperature range 420–800 °C is suggested for the TES/HTF system using this salt. Moreover, the recommended values of the heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity in the suggested working temperature range are given. In addition, corrosion control strategies for this salt including corrosion monitoring and mitigation techniques are briefly reviewed, since controlling the salt corrosivity is one main concern of the engineering aspects using the molten chlorides at high temperatures. Overall, this review is expected to supply reliable values of the most relevant salt properties and recommend the most promising corrosion control strategies for further material studies, as well as modeling, simulation, detailed design and construction of molten MgCl2–KCl–NaCl salt TES/HTF systems.

Abstract: The soiling of heliostats is a highly detrimental process that affects the energy conversion efficiency of solar tower power plants as soiled heliostats suffer significant drops of reflectance. Tools that allow reliable soiling measurements and predictions are needed to accurately assess the induced power losses and to develop strategies that mitigate the related detrimental effects. The results of an experimental campaign conducted at the Fraunhofer ISE laboratories are presented and discussed in this paper. Four different techniques were used to measure the reflectance of artificially soiled mirrors: (i) measurements obtained with a portable specular reflectometer 15R-RGB (D&S), (ii) spectral analysis of the outcomes of a spectrophotometer, (iii) post-processing analysis of the measurements obtained with the device VLABS (very low angular beam spread), and (iv) microscope-captured image processing. A detailed comparison between the measurements obtained with each device is performed to evaluate the agreement among them and the motivations of slightly different trends in the results. Finally, the outcomes of the analyses are proved to give further strength to the validation of a previously developed solar reflectors soiling model.

Abstract: Oxygen evolution is kinetically the key step in the photocatalytic water splitting, but it is negatively affected by the poor charge transport properties. However, this can be modified by the loading of cocatalysts on the surface of a semiconductor which could form heterojunctions to boost the charge separation and lower the activation potential for O2 evolution. In this paper we demonstrate that the poor O2 evolution activity of photocatalytic water splitting of the multiferroics BiFeO3 can be enhanced when a proper cocatalyst like IrO2 nanoparticles are deposited on the surface and proper electron scavenger is used. The choice of the persulfate, S2O8 as electron scavenger is influenced by its high redox potential and its close position to the valence band of BiFeO3 compared to other commonly used scavengers. Another interesting information was revealed by using transient absorption spectroscopy under different environment namely, inert, oxidizing and reducing. The absorption peak of holes was identified and correlated to the strong absorption around 560 nm The hole absorption peak showed a 50% decrease in the absorption intensity after 2.5 μsec indicating that holes are captured by IrO2 nanoparticles on the surface. O2 evolution of multiferroics, especially BiFeO3 has been less investigated. Therefore, the development of efficient photocatalytic materials has relied on both photocatalysts and cocatalysts. Identification of the photogenerated charge absorption peak from transient absorption spectra facilitate the evaluation of the IrO2 loading effect on the charge separation and the overall O2 evolution process.

Abstract: Solar salt (SS) is an energy storage material widely used in concentrating solar power (CSP) stations at industrial thermal energy storage (TES) systems in the current. Hence, a conventional high-temperature static melting method was used to prepare nano hexagonal boron nitride-SS (h-BN-SS, BS system) composite materials with different content of nano BN to improve the heat storage and transfer performance of SS. The specific heat (cp) of 1.81 J·g−1·K−1 was obtained at nano BN content of 0.8 wt% (sample BS6), which had increase of 16.03% compared with pure SS (sample BS0). The crystal planes (104) and (221) of nitrate appeared on the surface of nano BN (100), promoted the enhancement of surface energy of whole system. The using temperature zone was widened and thermal conductivity (λ) had been increased by 18.52%. The existence forms of nano BN hadn't changed at high temperature, and the cation environment around NO3− of BS0 and BS6 were changed after adding nano BN demonstrated by high temperature Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, BS6 had excellent thermal stability at long-term thermal stability measurement within 7200 min. The observations suggested that nano BN may serve as promising additive for solar energy storage material toward TES system applications.

Abstract: Concrete is identified in the literature as a suitable material for thermal energy storage applications, with even innovative application potentials such as storage media in concentrating solar power plants. To ensure a suitable heat transfer among concrete components, the binder material of concrete (cement paste) require further research and understanding to this aim. In particular, the thermal stability of cement paste under temperature cycled conditions arises as a research gap. In this study, ordinary Portland and calcium aluminate cement types were selected using a low water-cement ratio. Thermo-mechanical properties were studied before and after 1, 10, and 25 or 50 thermal cycles at 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C. Although ordinary Portland cement paste showed micro-cracking propagation after 25 thermal cycles from ambient temperature to 200 °C and 400 °C, both cement pastes preserved their integrity, being compressive strength higher in ordinary Portland cement. On the contrary, after 25 or 50 thermal cycles at 600 °C and 800 °C, only calcium aluminate cement preserved its integrity, while ordinary Portland cement revealed a fragmentation status. Despite the compressive strength decrease in calcium aluminate paste at 600 °C and 800 °C, as a result of porosity increase, the properties were maintained after 10 thermal cycles. However, thermal conductivity in calcium aluminate paste was reduced nearly 50% after the first cycle at temperatures higher than 200 °C.

Abstract: In this study, the epitaxial growth of co-evaporated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films (CIGSe) onto GaP/Si(001) pseudo-substrates, where the GaP thin layer is epitaxially grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), is investigated. Extensive structural characterisation of epi-CIGSe is carried out via X-ray diffraction as well as transmission electron microscopy. Sturdy evidence of an epitaxial growth of CIGSe on (GaP/Si)(001) is observed, with the propagation of twins originating from the GaP/Si interface, through the CIGSe/GaP interface. This work aims at paving the way for future CIGSe/GaP/Si structures for the development of tandem solar cells with a c-Si bottom cell, and a GaP interfacial buffer layer for band edge engineering, allowing for the monolithic epitaxial growth of high quality CIGSe as a thin film top cell absorber.

Abstract: Recently, many studies have focused on exploiting new spacer cations to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites solar cells (PSCs). As another essential part of RP perovskite structure, halogen anions have a substantial impact on crystalline quality. However, there are few studies about how halogen anions affect RP PSCs and their possible underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigate different halide anions that impact the optoelectronic properties of RP perovskite films. Specifically, we use PEAI, PEABr, and PEACl (PEA = phenethylammonium) to fabricate RP perovskite films based on PEA2MA3Pb4I11X2 (X = I, Br or Cl, n = 4) for systematical study. Through a series of characterizations and analyses, RP perovskite films with PEACl show a higher proportion of vertical crystal orientation and fewer trap-states, which leads to improved carrier transmission pathways. As a result, the devices based on PEACl (PEA2MA3Pb4I11Cl2, n = 4) achieve a champion PCE of 12.02%, which is higher than PEAI (6.76%, PEA2MA3Pb4I13, n = 4) and PEABr (4.26%, PEA2MA3Pb4I11Br2, n = 4).

Abstract: Background
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development involves many genetic alterations. This study profiled differentially expressed microRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and selected miR-375 for further study.
Methods
DE-miRNAs were screened using online databases and subjected to various analyzes. miR-375 mimics with negative control (NC) cDNA, and a ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) as well as a NC group were transfected into NPC cells for analysis by quantitative PCR, western blotting, wound healing, Transwell, flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and luciferase gene reporter assays.
Results
Among these DE-miRNAs, miR-375 was downregulated and miR-21 was upregulated in NPC cells. Bioinformatical analysis identified USP1 as a potential target gene of miR-375. Increased USP1 expression was associated with poor survival of head and neck cancer patients. The luciferase assay confirmed miR-375 binding to the USP1 3'-untranslated region (UTR), while the transfection experiment confirmed miR-375 expression reduced USP1 expression. USP1 overexpression reversed the anti-tumor activity of miR-375 in NPC cells as determined by tumor cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, and viability assays. In addition, USP1 overexpression activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, whereas a selective PI3K inhibitor (S2739) could reverse the effects of USP1 on NPC cells in vitro.
Conclusions
miR-375 and miR-21 are both related to NPC and miR-375 can target USP1. Further experiments revealed that up-regulated miR-375 expression led to USP1 down-regulation, and miR-375 overexpression suppressed PI3K/Akt signaling and inhibited NPC cell migration and invasion, but promoted NPC cell apoptosis.

Abstract: We investigate the effect of incident spectra on current loss as a function of depth and voltage into high efficiency textured bifacial silicon heterojunction solar cells. We integrate thin-film ellipsometry measurements with a 3D optical model and a 2D electronic model and validate our model with measurements of external quantum efficiency and Suns-Voc. For front illumination at normal incidence, an increasing air mass of AM1.5 to 10 reduces current density loss due to parasitic absorption in ITO and a-Si:H from 8.1% to 4.0%, and increases recombination loss at maximum power from 4.2% to 4.7%, resulting in an overall increase in collected current (88.2% to 90.5%). Cell performance metrics are summarized as a function of air mass, with efficiency peaking at AM5.0 for front illuminated and rear illuminated cells with an albedo of unity. We further demonstrate the impact of spectra on bifacial efficiency by calculating rear-side performance with the spectral albedo of dry grass. Overall, current-collection and efficiency trends emphasize the importance of considering spectral effects in energy yield models. These results are of particular importance for cell structures with high bifaciality and significant spectral albedo contributions, locations with large proportions of diffuse light, and high air mass locations as in mid-to-high latitudes.

Abstract: The severe operation conditions and great capital investment of solar power tower central receivers motivate the lifetime analysis of a molten-salt external-cylindrical-tubular receiver, considering five alloy alternatives for its tubes manufacturing: Haynes 230, alloy 316H, Inconel 625, 740H and 800H. An analytical low-computational cost methodology is employed, considering the temperature dependence of tube material properties, elastic-plastic stresses/strains and stress relaxation. Thus, creep and fatigue experimental data available in the literature for these alloys are compiled in this work, providing the coefficients required for the methodology followed. A great alloys operation limitation is the film temperature to avoid corrosion issues; the most permissive are H230, 740H and 800H (650 °C), followed by Inconel 625 (630 °C) and 316H (600 °C). This, and the twice the yield strength, is regarded to set the heliostat field aiming strategy as equatorial as possible for each alloy, resulting in great power production divergences: 24% and 65% less for 625 and alloy 316H receivers with respect to the 740H receiver. Then, the lifetime analysis for a clear design day operation, representative of the receiver during ideal operation, is performed. The stress relaxation regard becomes critical for the accurate damage prediction; alloys 316H and 800H show stress reset during operation, not benefitting from a global stress relaxation. Thus, 800H exhibits a poor endurance. For the clear-day assumption, 740H shows the best lifetime and costs/power performance; the levelized cost of alloy of H230, 625 and alloy 316H is 0.01, 0.09 and over 0.25, respectively, with respect to 740H.

Abstract: Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the newest class of anticancer drugs. Pneumonitis is increasingly being recognized as a potential complication of these agents.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of patients who received ICIs at a comprehensive cancer center. We collected data on demographics, type of malignancy, type of ICI agent, incidence of pneumonitis up to 6 weeks after receiving ICI agent, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for overall survival in patients who develop pneumonitis.
Results
A total of 654 patients received ICIs during the study period. The most common type of cancer for which ICI was given was adenocarcinoma of the lung (29%), followed by renal cell cancer (12%) and squamous cell lung cancer (12%). Among the study patients, 41% received nivolumab and 32% received pembrolizumab. Other patients in the study received combination of ICIs or ICI plus chemotherapeutic agent, or were part of clinical trial involving ICI. Overall 42 (6.4%) patients developed pneumonitis within 6 weeks after the last dose of treatment of any ICI agent. Of these, 81% of patients had Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis and 45% of these required hospital admission for pneumonitis, with 10% of them requiring admission to intensive care unit. Overall, patients who received pembrolizumab-containing regimen, had prior chemotherapy, or who never had cancer-related surgery had increased risk of death.
Conclusion
Our large retrospective study shows real-life data of incidence of pneumonitis in patients who are treated with ICIs for cancer treatment. Our data indicate that the incidence of pneumonitis is overall lower than that reported previously with relatively good outcomes.

Loss of lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1) induces browning in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via β3-AR and the ERK-independent signaling pathway,

Abstract: Increased browning of white adipocytes (beiging) is considered a promising therapeutic strategy to fight obesity and its associated metabolic complications. However, the molecular mechanism modulating brown and beige fat-mediated thermogenesis is not fully elucidated. Here, we identified the lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1) as a factor that obstructs fat browning in white adipocytes. LCP1 plays a vital role in non-hematopoietic malignancies, and is also a well-known tumor biomarker; however, evidence regarding its function in adipocytes remains to be elucidated. The current study explores the physiological role of LCP1 in cultured 3T3-L1 white adipocytes, by applying the loss-of-function study using siRNA. Induction of fat browning by LCP1 depletion was evidenced by evaluating the gene and protein expression levels of brown fat-associated markers through real-time qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. We observed that deficiency of LCP1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, and significantly enhances expressions of the core brown fat-specific genes (Cd137, Cidea, Cited1, Tbx1, and Tmem26) and proteins (PGC-1α, PRDM16, and UCP1). In addition, deficiency of LCP1 promotes lipid catabolism as well as suppresses adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Loss of LCP1 also ameliorates cellular stress by downregulating JNK and c-JUN in adipocytes, and stimulates apoptosis. A mechanistic study revealed that deficiency of LCP1 induces browning in white adipocytes, independently via β3-AR and the ERK signaling pathway. The current data reveals a previously unknown mechanism of LCP1 in browning of white adipocytes, and highlights the potential of LCP1 as a pharmacotherapeutic target for treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Transmittance spectra, atomic-force microscopic images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectra and droplet contact angle images show that a facile wet etching process can be used to manipulate the thickness, surface roughness, surface chemical composition and surface wettability of the indium-tin oxide (ITO) thin films, which influences the molecular packing structure of the P3CT-Na thin films and thereby dominating the crystal quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the P3CT-Na based MAPbI3 solar cells can be improved from 17.02% to 19.35% by increasing the Sn/In concentration ratio of the ITO thin films from 0.36 to 0.47 with a facile wet etching process at a constant temperature of 40 °C. It is noted that the PCE of the optimal solar cell decreases slowly toward a stable PCE of 16% for more than 60 days under moderate environment conditions (55 ± 10 RH%).

Abstract: High-efficient silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells are ideal bifacial devices. In this application context, Na+ ions induced degradations from encapsulation soda-lime glass are of significance. We conducted accelerated Na+ ions aging experiments at 85 °C, 85% relative humidity without encapsulation to simulate damp heat test in soda-lime glass for SHJ solar cells. It is found that Na+ ions accelerated the formation of metal In and In(OH)3 or InOOH in damp heat condition, which destroyed the capping metal oxide, i.e., tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO). Interestingly, it demonstrates that the device stability is highly dependent on the crystallinity of IWO films. IWO films with large grains are more resistive to Na+ ions erosion, and consequently, account for the enhanced device stability of SHJ solar cells. We believe this work provides a guide for designing more reliable bifacial SHJ solar cells installed in hot climates and coastal areas.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the common neurodegenerative diseases characterized by memory impairment. The protective effects of stem cell-based therapy have been reported in AD. In this study, it was assumed that Chitosan-coated Selenium nanoparticles (ChSeNPs) increase the efficiency of stem cells in the attenuation of neurotoxicity in the rat AD model. The AD model was induced using Streptozotocin (STZ) and treated by the adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) and SeNPs/ChSeNPs (0.4 mg/kg). Passive avoidance learning and recognition memory were assessed using shuttle box and novel object recognition tasks. The amyloid-beta deposition, the injected cells' homing and survival, antioxidant capacity, and BDNF concentration were evaluated using the histological, biochemical, and ELISA methods. The results showed that the combined administration of ChSeNPs and AMSCs is more effective in increasing the step-through latency and discrimination index than administering SeNPs and stem cells. Combined therapy caused a significant increase in antioxidant capacity that ChSeNPs was more effective than SeNPs, while AMSCs beside SeNPs had a greater effect on BDNF levels compared to conventional treatment of nanoparticles or AMSCs alone. Ultimately, the homing and survival of the transplanted AMSCs were greater in the group that received both stem cells and ChSeNPs. Taken together, it seems that the administration of ChSeNPs enhances the efficiency of transplanted stem cells in decreasing the neurotoxicity induced by STZ through an increase in the antioxidant capacity.

Aluminum (Al) -doped zinc oxide (AZO) has been widely applied as the window layer in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) owing to its favorable optoelectronic properties, as its properties can be controlled and further improved with suitable dopants. In this study, we strategically co-dope Al and fluorine (F) in ZnO thin films (FAZO) to improve the transmittance with controlled carrier concentration. To study the influence of F dopant on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of FAZO thin films, the F doping concentration is varied (0–1.5%) while keeping the Al content fixed (2%). With increasing F doping concentration, the carrier concentration, transmittance, and bandgap values increase, whereas, the sheet resistance and resistivity of the single-layer FAZO thin films decrease, compared to the reference AZO film. The addition of a small amount of F alters the surface roughness with increasing concentration. The properties of the single-layer FAZO thin films show deteriorated properties at the highest doping concentration (1.5%). Under the optimum condition of 1% F, FAZO thin films exhibit the lowest sheet resistance of 5.84 Ω/sq, in addition to the highest transmittance of 89.3% in the visible light region. Furthermore, the FAZO thin films applied in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) device shows significant enhancements in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), resulting in improved device performance from ~8 to 9.57%.

Abstract: The increasing demand for photovoltaic (PV) electricity has resulted in wider usage for many applications. Current dominant PV electrical sources use crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar modules. These would provide greater potential as an energy source if they could be installed to any surface with a curvature, for example integration into buildings, and would perform better under omni-directional incident light, which is not considered in the design of current modules. In this study, we propose an origami-type foldable c-Si solar cell module by introducing a tessellated module design and textile-based woven metal connections to overcome the limitations of using c-Si solar cell modules on curved surfaces and under various light conditions. For the proposed module, two main concepts are introduced: a tessellation design for rigid folding and stretchable textile-based metal connections. The flexible crease pattern and interconnection allows the modules to be folded up to 180°, and a diagonal force on the metal textile can be induced on the inter-module connections using rotating wires. These features allow solar cell modules to cover an arbitrary surface without electrical degradation. Tessellating the module allows for maximum potential using the origami design when applied to both flat and curved surfaces. The origami-type foldable tessellated modules performed better than conventional modules. Their energy production under various angles of incident light is higher per day than that of flat modules, even during periods of lower intensity sunlight from a low solar altitude. These findings demonstrate a new approach to extend the usage of c-Si solar cells.

Abstract: The production of molecular hydrogen by photoelectrochemical dissociation (PEC) of water is a promising technique, which allows the direct transformation of solar energy into hydrogen, an energy vector acclaimed by the scientific community and policymakers. Hydrogen stores solar energy and will help overcome the energy crisis and associated environmental problems. Currently, the design and development of innovative photocatalysts with strong photoelectrochemical activity remain a major challenge, and the subject of intense research activity within the international scientific community. Here we describe the synthesis and photoelectrochemical properties of one-dimensional nanostructures of graphitic carbon nitride (1D-gC3N4) doped with phosphorus or sulfur (1D-P-gC3N4 &1D-S-gC3N4, respectively). A new synthesis method using supramolecular melamine, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and tri-thiocyanuric acid as precursors has been developed. The samples were characterized by powder-X Ray diffraction (p-XRD), X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The activity towards the photo-oxidation of water was studied by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). Compared to 3D material, the activity was found to be significantly improved, thanks in particular to the 1D morphology of gC3N4. It was further strengthened by doping with phosphorus and sulfur. The photo-oxidation mechanism of water was analyzed by photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). The measurements show that the resistance to charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface can be greatly reduced by controlling the morphology of gC3N4, and that doping with phosphorus and sulfur also plays a positive role. The PEIS analysis makes it possible to demonstrate that the lifetime of the photo-generated electrons in 1D-gC3N4 is increased compared to 3D-gC3N4, and that doping with phosphorus or sulfur further improves it. The width of the forbidden bands and the position of the valence and conduction bands of the different materials were determined by Mott - Schottky type measurements.

Abstract: To date, photoanodes containing bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (ANPs) are exposed good photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for hydrogen production owing to their optoelectronic properties. In this work, low-cost, visible light active and environmental-friendly BiVO4/Bi–Cu nanocomposite photoanode is fabricated via organic decomposition and electrodeposition process. Transmission electron microscope images reveals that Bi–Cu ANPs are uniformly distributed on BiVO4 which can enhance the PEC performance. Typical results originate that BiVO4/Bi–Cu nanocomposite exhibits a high photocurrent density of 10.31 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V and solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 3.55%, which is higher than other electrodes. In addition, this composite shows excellent long-term stability over 5 h and low charge transfer resistance. These results suggest the introduction of Bi–Cu ANPs enhances the broadband light absorption of BiVO4 due to the excitation of localized surface plasmons at different wavelengths and also improves the charge transportation in the photoanode. Thus, BiVO4/Bi–Cu photoelectrode reports here is superior PEC performance for hydrogen generation providing an economical and feasible route to fabricate surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-enhanced composites as photocatalysts using earth-abundant Bi and Cu metals instead of noble-metals.

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), the metallic materials employed to build the critical components of the plant are exposed to severe conditions, Carbon and stainless steel have been used for this application. However, the technology CSP will evolve, so these materials will probably be replaced by superior performing and economically competitive ones. Likewise, the investigation of molten salts with better thermophysical properties but no more corrosive than the actual benchmark has become a complex challenge. Thus, the research motivation was to study the performance of a martensitic steel exposed to a promising ternary molten salt with lithium nitrate at 550 °C by its corrosion behavior and mechanical properties. The corrosion process was monitored through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The mechanical properties in molten salt at high temperature were determined by slow strain rate testing (SSRT), complementing with the characterization of corrosion products to propose the corrosion mechanism in one scheme. The results showed that the steel is less robust but more ductile in the presence of molten salts at high temperatures; besides the material develop a multi-layer non-porous corrosion product that, despite deteriorating, confers corrosion rates within the recommended ranges for the application.

Abstract: Subambient radiative cooling is an emerging passive cooling strategy that simultaneously reflects the incident solar irradiance to depress the heat gain and radiates heat from objects to enhance the heat loss without any electricity consumption from compressor-based air-conditioning. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing materials, such as complicated photonic crystals and metamaterials or expensive polymer composites with both high solar reflectance and infrared emittance, the gap still exists between efficient radiative cooling performance and an affordable radiative cooling device. Here, a facile, low-cost, and home-built approach to achieve efficient subambient radiative cooling, which employs commercially available materials of the polyethylene (PE) bubble wrap and aluminum foils, is reported for scalable industrial and domestic applications. The aluminum foils are infrared-reflective and sunlight-opaque, acting as a solar shield and infrared waveguide, which can both block the solar irradiation and guide infrared thermal radiation to the cold outer space. PE thin film is infrared-transparent with a high mid-infrared transmittance that allows mid-infrared thermal radiation to pass through. It is thermally insulating with a low thermal conductivity of 0.038 W/m ⋅ K after being fabricated into air-filled bubbles to minimize parasitic non-radiative heat transfer. An average subambient temperature reduction of 4.0°C has been achieved during the noontime in summer. These commercially available materials make this design a practical technique for people to realize an affordable and comfortable interior environment during the summer in a cost-effective manner without any professional constructions. The nature of low-cost, home-built, and easily integrated into buildings renders it attractive for everyone, especially for those in developing regions.

Abstract: Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) photovoltaic (PV) systems often disregard novel module designs (e.g. glass-glass modules) and the fast pace of improvements in production. This study closes this research gap by comparing the environmental impacts of sc-Si glass-backsheet and glass-glass modules produced in China, Germany and the European Union (EU), using current inventory data. Results show lower potential environmental impacts for glass-glass compared to glass-backsheet modules and lower impacts for production in the EU and Germany compared to China for most impact categories. Concerning climate change, glass-backsheet (glass-glass) modules produced in China, Germany or the EU are linked to emissions of 810 (750), 580 (520) and 480 (420) kg CO2-eq/kWp, respectively. This corresponds to CO2-eq emission reductions of 30% for German and 40% for European production compared to Chinese production, and 8–12.5% reduction in glass-glass compared to glass-backsheet modules. Carbon intensity of produced electricity, excluding balance of system (BOS), amounts to 13–30 g CO2-eq/kWh, depending on production location and electricity yield calculation method. A warranty-based yield calculation method shows the influence of different lifetime electricity yields of glass-glass and glass-backsheet modules on the potential environmental impacts. This study identifies module efficiency, energy requirements, silicon consumption and carbon-intensity of electricity during production as significant levers for future reductions of environmental impacts. It emphasizes the importance of up-to-date inventories and current modelling of electricity mixes for representative LCA results of PV modules. Lastly, this paper argues that more differentiated methodological guidelines are needed to incentivize the development of sustainable module designs.

Abstract: The eutectic mixture formed by urea and sodium nitrate can be an interesting candidate for use as a phase change material for thermal energy storage in space heating and domestic hot water applications. It shows a melting point of 85 °C, a melting enthalpy of 172 J/g and a price around 0.9 €/kg. However, the thermal stability of the mixture is a great concern for this application. A preliminary evaluation of the thermal stability was performed and previously reported by the authors. It consisted of an accelerated thermal cycling test with 210 thermal cycles and the material showed a stable behavior. Nevertheless, the long-term stability of urea in the liquid state at temperatures below 100 °C is uncertain and requires a specific study. The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the long-term thermal stability of the mixture when it is exposed to long periods of use under conditions representative of actual applications, by means of analyzing the thermal and compositional behavior of samples remaining at 100 °C for several periods up to one year. A methodology is proposed, which intends to isolate the thermal degradation phenomenon from others, such as phase segregation, supercooling, and polymorphism, that can be introduced by thermal-cycling. It also aims to be more representative of the actual application than the accelerated thermal cycling approach.

Abstract: Electrochromic energy storage devices (EESDs) have a wide range of applications from static displays to building windows. However, it is a great challenge to assemble EESDs with both high performance of energy storage and electrochromism. In this work, we design a multifunctional EESD composed of a Li4Ti5O12 and a Prussian white. Li4Ti5O12 (E = 1.55 V vs Li/Li+) film with excellent lithium-ion storage performance is used as the anode, and Prussian white film (E = 3.2 V vs Li/Li+) as the cathode. Thanks to the complementary electrochromic behavior, the suitable redox voltage gap, and the intrinsic electrochemical stability of Li4Ti5O12 film and Prussian white film, the as-assembled EESD exhibits excellent electrochromic performances including broad optical modulation (55.3% at 529 nm), high coloration efficiency (170.1 cm2 C−1), and long-term cycling stability (retention of 95.8% of initial optical modulation after 1000 cycles). And the EESD shows high energy density of 127.2 mWh cm−2 and exceptionally high power density of 24 mW cm−2. This EESD with an output voltage of 1.5 V and Coulombic efficiency of 98.8% is promising for applications of electrochromic smart windows and static displays to significantly reduce their energy consumption.

Abstract: Xylitol with high latent heat of 243.28 kJ/kg and a significant supercooling degree has been considered to be a potential phase change material (PCM) for long-term thermal energy storage (TES). Xylitol can be kept in a supercooled or supersaturated metastable for a long time. In our study, it took 23 days and 30 min respectively that xylitol liquid and xylitol liquid adding 5 wt% ethanol crystallized completely at room temperature of 15 ± 5 °C. Unfortunately, the low thermal conductivity and leakage of xylitol restrict its thermal performance. In this paper, xylitol/expanded graphite (EG) composite PCMs with 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15 wt% EG content were prepared by an “impregnation and compression” two-step method. The results of SEM, XRD and FT-IR show that xylitol is well impregnated into the micropores of EG and has good chemical compatibility. The thermal performance test shows that the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs increases dramatically and the latent heat decreases with the increase of EG. The experimental results show that the latent heat of 10 wt% EG is 209.73 kJ/kg and 192.18 kJ/kg, respectively, during the charging and discharging process. The thermal conductivity of 10 wt% EG is 3.91 W/(m·K), as 9.29 times as xylitol. Besides, the crystallization of xylitol in EG and the mass loss of the composites have also been studied. The results show that 10 wt% EG composites crystallized completely after 16 days. These results prove that xylitol/EG composite PCMs have broad application prospects in long-term TES.

Abstract: Owing to the high thermal capacity and nearly constant temperature during phase change, phase change material has been considered one of the most promising solar thermal energy storage materials. However, the development of high-performance shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) based on a low-cost and eco-friendly supporting material remains a big challenge. Herein, a systematic experimental framework is proposed and used to respond to the challenge. By applying this framework, acid-modified fly ash (AMFA) was firstly used as the supporting material for lauric acid (LA) to prevent its leakage, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were utilized to improve its thermal conductivity. Specifically, the LA/AMFA/CNTs composites were synthesized via a facile and low-cost direct impregnation method. Subsequently, the as-prepared composites were systematically investigated by various characterization techniques. The results of leakage tests exhibited that the acid treatment could improve the PCM loading of fly ash and the relevant mechanism of acid-modified fly ash was identified. With the introduction of CNTs, the heat transfer efficiency of LA/AMFA/CNTs had been enhanced substantially. More importantly, compared with conventional supporting materials, the used fly ash in this work revealed much better environmental sustainability which we believe is of vital importance for the large-scale application of SSPCMs. Therefore, the study results not only facilitate the development of the desirable SSPCM based on cheap and eco-friendly supporting material and promote its practical application, but also serve to improve the comprehensive utilization level of fly ash solid waste.

Abstract: Potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate in mixing proportion of KNO3–NaNO3 40-60 wt% (also called solar salt) has been successfully used for over a decade as heat storage medium for concentrated solar power parabolic-trough collector plants at temperatures up to 400 °C. At temperatures of 560 °C, reached in state-of-the-art solar tower systems, corrosion of metallic components in contact with solar salt can become an issue and has caused leaks and plant shut-downs in recently built tower projects. While the corrosion rates of several materials have been determined for different temperatures in static molten salt immersion experiments, there is a lack of corrosion data for dynamic in-service conditions. In this work, a dynamic corrosion test has been conducted on 19 different material types including protective coatings, mimicking flow-rate, temperature gradient and draining of in-service operation of a receiver in a concentrated solar power tower. The measured corrosion rates are presented and compared to static corrosion tests reported in literature.

Abstract: Operational stability is becoming one of the most crucial parameters for commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However the stability issue of PSCs is currently far from being resolved due to complicated and still unclear degradations. In this work, we systematically demonstrate the degradation of metal cathode PSCs under operation conditions. Discussions about influence of intrinsic factors i.e. light illumination, voltage and current, on device degradation are conducted. It is concluded that metal cathode stripping/plating behavior (electrochemical metallization effect) due to current together with perovskite degradation could dominate the device degradation. It is deduced that electrochemical cell in the PSC system could be formed by metal/counter electrodes and perovskite electrolyte. Both cells accelerate degradation of metal electrode and perovskite in working conditions, hence device degradation. These insights into the degradation and mechanisms can help further understand the working principle and solve the instability problem of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: High-quality perovskite films are crucial for developing efficient planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As-prepared perovskite films have low crystallinity and high level of trap densities, resulting in the deterioration of PSCs performances. Herein, a facile approach is adopted to fabricate high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films by incorporating different types of zinc salt, including zinc iodide (ZnI2), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2). It is demonstrated that zinc ions (Zn2+) substitute a part of the lead ion (Pb2+) sites, enlarging the grain size, and suppressing the formation of metallic lead. Moreover, the acetate anion bearing the carbonyl species (CO) effectively passivates the under-coordinated Pb2+ defects and further reduces the defect densities at both the grain boundaries and interfaces. As a result, the planar PSCs with the Zn(Ac)2 additive yield a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32%, which is 15% higher than that of the control device. Simultaneously, the outperforming device delivers remarkable stability, retaining 87% of its original efficiency after aging for 500 h under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Objectives
The purpose of this study was to compare data obtained from the reticulocyte channel (RET channel) heated to 41°C with those obtained from impedance channel (I-Channel) at room temperature in the samples with the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)<370g/L and in samples with the MCHC>370g/L, in the presence of cold agglutinins.
Methods
In this study, 60 blood samples (group 1) with the MCHC<370g/L (without cold agglutinins) and 78 blood samples (group 2) with the MCHC>370g/L (with cold agglutinins) were used to compare the two analytical channels of the XN-9000 analyzer in different preanalytical conditions. The parameters evaluated in both groups were the following: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean cell volume (MCV), RBC-most frequent volume (R-MFV), mean hemoglobin concentration (MCH) and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).
Results
The results of this study showed an excellent correlation with both channels of the XN-9000 analyzer in samples with and without cold agglutinins, except for the MCHC. The bias between the values obtained in the I-channel and those obtained in the RET channel of both groups was insignificant and remained within the limits of acceptability, as reported by Ricos et al. for all considered parameters, except for MCHC.
Conclusions
The presence of cold agglutinins in blood samples can be detected by a spurious lowering of the RBC count and by a spurious increase in the MCHC. The RET channel represents a great opportunity to correct the RBC count in a rapid manner without preheating. However, neither methodology can completely solve the residual presence of cold agglutinins in all samples, despite the MCHC values being < 370g/L.

Abstract: Light-induced degradation (LID) can occur in crystalline silicon (Si) due to increased recombination in the bulk or at the surfaces. As an example, copper (Cu) is a contaminant that reportedly causes LID in the bulk of Si under illumination. In this article, we show that Cu contamination can also increase recombination at the surface under illumination using surface saturation current density (J0) analysis. More specifically, in the presence of Cu we observed that J0 increased from 14 fA/cm2 to 330 fA/cm2 in SiO2 passivated Float Zone (FZ) Si, and from 11 fA/cm2 to 200 fA/cm2 in corresponding Czochralski (Cz) Si after illumination under an LED lamp (0.6 Suns, 80 °C). In reference samples without Cu contamination, the J0 was unaffected. These results demonstrate that a significant increase in surface recombination is possible without the presence of hydrogen. Furthermore, hydrogen was not seen to affect the Cu-induced surface degradation as similar experiments made with hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx:H) did not show further increase in J0. However, the timescale of the observed degradation was relatively fast (hours) indicating that Cu-induced surface degradation is a separate phenomenon from the earlier reported surface-related degradation.

Abstract: Mist chemical vapor deposition (mist CVD), which is capable of producing oxide films over large areas at a high productivity and low cost, has been proposed as a fabrication method for VO2 thin films for smart windows. However, the thermochromic properties of the VO2 films previously prepared by mist CVD are not sufficient for application in smart windows. In this study, to obtain a high-quality VO2 film, we investigated the effects of the solvent of the precursor solution on the resulting film in mist CVD. Films consisting of a single phase of VO2 were obtained when a water-based precursor solution was used. In contrast, V2O3 films are formed when a methanol-based precursor solution is used. The VO2 film deposited from water solution exhibited high visible transmittance along with a large change in the infrared transmittance with temperature change. The high quality of the VO2 film indicates that mist CVD is an effective method for the fabrication of VO2-based smart windows.

Abstract: The effects of Na on Cu2SnS3 (CTS) solar cells were investigated by focusing on the electrical properties obtained using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Hall measurements to clarify which factors and regions are strongly affected by sulfurization with a NaF layer. The increase in the depletion layer width (xdep) suggested that the number of non-radiative recombination centers decreased at the p–n interface of the CTS solar cell owing to the sulfurization process with the NaF layer. Thus, the increase in Jsc indicated that the carrier collection width widened as xdep increased. Furthermore, Voc increased because the CTS lifetime was lengthened. The performance of the CTS solar cells was improved by these factors. Moreover, as a result of an investigation of the dark and light J–V properties, suppression of the crossover behavior was accomplished by sulfurization with the NaF layer. This technique improved the CTS/Mo and CdS/CTS interfaces owing to the Na content, leading to increases in all desirable solar cell properties. Therefore, the induction of Na from a soda-lime glass substrate as well as sulfurization with a NaF layer is required to obtain highly efficient CTS solar cells. As a result of this study, a CTS solar cell with an efficiency higher than 5.24% was achieved.

Abstract: Four prototypes of lightweight photovoltaic modules for applications in on-grid systems have been designed, developed, manufactured and tested for compliance with relevant IEC standards. Selected, commercially available materials characterized by thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry, scanning electron microscopy and nanoindentation technique were used in frameless, adhesively-bonded sandwich-structures carrying the interdigitated back contact solar cells. With dedicated manufacturing processes the prototype-dependent weight between 3.37 and 3.77 kg/m2, the STC-maximum power in the range of 221–239 Wp together with power conversion efficiencies of 19.98–20.71% were obtained. Millimetre-sized texture improved module's performance for steeper solar incidence angles. The self-cleaning capability of modules was enhanced by a hydrophobic material utilized in front linings. The structure of the prototypes helps to build non-intrusive installations on low-load capacity roofs, even in large-scale lightweight buildings.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell, as one of the promising technologies for next-generation passivating contact solar cells, employs an undiffused and n-type mono-crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrate and two amorphous-silicon-based selective contacts with opposite polarities. In this work, a numerical model based on Richter's theory has been developed to simulate the performances of a 25.11 % efficiency SHJ solar cell obtained recently. Analyses on series resistivity (Rs) explicit that the upper bound for the sum of contact resistivities for p-type (ρc,p) and n-type (ρc,n) contacts is 0.073 Ω cm2. With the updated contact resistivities, the theoretical limiting efficiency estimated by Brendel's formulation is therefore 28.5 % for SHJ solar cells, which is comparable to 28.7 % for bi-facial tunneling-oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells. A hybrid structure consisting of p-type contact from SHJ and n-type contact from TOPCon is feasible to reach 28.9 % limiting efficiency in principle, showing potential of solar cells with hybrid structures.

Abstract: Chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that represents a major public health issue nowadays. Here, we investigated the protective role of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) inducing kinase (NIK)-inhibitor on chronic periodontitis and revealed the underlying molecular mechanism. NIK-inhibitor was synthesized, and its functions were examined in primary osteoclasts and wild-type (WT) and NIK-/- chronic periodontitis mouse model. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or activator of NF-κB was applied to stimulate inflammatory response of osteoclasts. The qRT-PCR, ELISA and Western blot were used to measure the expression of pro-inflammatory and osteoclast-related genes, and the activation of NF-κB signaling. Osteoclastogenesis and bone damage were detected by TRAP staining and micro-CT. NIK knockdown mice had lower expression of osteoclast-related genes and improved CEJ-ABC damage. Similarly, NIK-inhibitor administration inhibited inflammatory responses and CEJ-ABC damage in chronic periodontitis models. NIK-inhibitor suppressed osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-related genes expression through inhibiting the non-canonical NF-κB signaling. NIK plays important role in bone destruction of chronic periodontitis and NIK-inhibitor represents a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.

Abstract: Development of photoactive chemical heat storage (PCHS) materials that can be isomerized without ultraviolet light and have outstanding storage performance as well as high rate heat output capability under low temperature conditions is a core issue for effective solar thermal conversion. In this study, we report a novel PCHS material by attaching ortho-tetrafluorinated azobenzene (AzoTF) onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for photothermal conversion and storage. By applying the strategy of separating the n → π* transition of two different configurations of AzoTF to the field of PCHS materials, this AzoTF-rGO composite not only realizes the isomerization with visible light for two configurations with a long life cycle, but also exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and low temperature high rate heat output capability, which greatly increases its exploitation value. Moreover, the AzoTF-rGO composite also shows remarkable heat storage density (Max. 345.8 kJ kg−1), power density (Max. 2401.4 W kg−1) attribute to the intermolecular hydrogen bond as well as the strong intermolecular interactions arise from the high attachment density. This new AzoTF-rGO PCHS material may paves a new way for more effective and efficient solar thermal energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: Optical loss is a significant factor restricting the conversion efficiency of conventional bifacial tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells. Black silicon structure is commonly used to enhance the photogenerated current density (Jph) of crystalline solar cells due to its excellent light-trapping capability. However, the photogenerated current gain is cancelled by the increased emitter recombination current originated from the black silicon structure with a high enhanced surface area ratio. In this work, we used a buffered oxide etching solution to modify the surface morphology of nanopore/micron-pyramid composite (NPP) structure silicon. Further, we studied the effects of NPP structures with different enhanced surface area ratio on front-side reflection, boron atom doping, emitter passivation, and cell performance. By identifying the appropriate surface modification processing, we fabricated the large-scale (158.75 mm × 158.75 mm) bifacial TOPCon solar cells using industrial equipment and processes with an average short-circuit current density of 41.12 mA/cm2 and average conversion efficiency of 23.08%. Through adequately widening nanostructure size and depositing high-quality Al2O3/SiNx stacked passivation films on NPP structure surface, we achieved lower carrier recombination while maintaining high Jph.

Abstract: A 2-terminal, dual-junction, epitaxially integrated, GaAsP/Si tandem solar cell with an 3rd party certified efficiency of 23.4 % was fabricated via MOCVD growth on an ex-situ produced Si sub cell. The drastic efficiency improvement over the authors previous peer-reviewed demonstration of such a device architecture is examined. Critical advancements in top cell design to maximize short wavelength response were critical in enabling improved top cell response. An in-depth analysis of this champion tandem cell has identified key loss mechanisms which elucidate the pathway for further efficiency gains. First, voltage dependent collection efficiency in the GaAsP top cell is the primary cause of fill factor losses currently limiting efficiency. Analysis of spectrally resolved I–V measurements and analytical device modeling and indicate poor diffusion length due to elevated dislocation densities as the likely cause for the voltage dependent collection efficiency. Second, modeling for the GaAs0.75P0.25 top cell, using experimental data at multiple dislocation densities, provides quantitative understanding of the current and voltage losses associated with threading dislocations providing a clear efficiency pathway with reduction in dislocation density. Lastly Si subcell modeling identifies the pathway for further Si subcell advances over the present, simplistic design, which has yet to employ the known benefits of rear surface texture or dielectric passivation.

Abstract: We examine the impact of hydrogen on the boron-oxygen-related lifetime degradation and regeneration kinetics in boron-doped p-type Czochralski-grown silicon wafers. We introduce the hydrogen into the silicon bulk by rapid thermal annealing. The hydrogen source are hydrogen-rich silicon nitride (SiNx:H) layers. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layers of varying thickness are placed in-between the silicon wafer surfaces and the SiNx:H layers. By varying the Al2O3 thickness, which acts as an effective hydrogen diffusion barrier, the hydrogen bulk content is varied over more than one order of magnitude. The hydrogen content is determined from measured wafer resistivity changes. In order to examine the impact of hydrogen on the degradation kinetics, all samples are illuminated at a light intensity of 0.1 suns near room temperature. We observe no impact of the in-diffused hydrogen content on the degradation rate constant, confirming that hydrogen is not involved in the boron-oxygen degradation mechanism. The regeneration experiments at 160°C and 1 sun, however, show a clear dependence on the hydrogen content with a linear increase of the regeneration rate constant with increasing bulk hydrogen concentration. However, extrapolation of our measurements toward a zero in-diffused hydrogen content shows that the regeneration is still working even without any in-diffused hydrogen. Hence, our measurements demonstrate that there are two distinct regeneration processes taking place. This is in good agreement with a recently proposed defect reaction model and is also in agreement with the finding that the permanent boron-oxygen deactivation also works on non-fired solar cells, though at a lower rate.

Abstract: There is considerable research effort being made to improve the efficiency of solar cells. Perovskite architectures that use titanium dioxide nanorods as electron transport layers are among technologies that have been proven to have enhanced efficiency. However, assessments of the life cycle environmental performances of such nanorod-based perovskite solar cells are limited. In this study, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment is conducted to evaluate the environmental footprints in terms of energy payback time, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the net energy ratio of this architecture. Unlike most studies that focus on the life cycle of the cell processing, this study extends the scope to include the balance of the system (BOS) and to evaluate the environmental effects of reusing important components such as fluorine-doped tin oxide glass and the gold layer, which appear to significantly impact energy consumption and associated GHG emissions. The energy payback time is calculated to be 0.97−0.41+0.78years and the life cycle GHG emissions to be 181.5−82+170g CO2 eq/kWh of electricity produced for a solar system. The net energy ratio is 3.1, indicating the system is a net energy generator. The assembly life cycle stage, comprising the panel production, BOS and mounting of solar panels, generates the most GHG emissions and the contribution from the cell fabrication stage is second. It was observed that the embodied GHG emissions for fluorine-doped tin oxide glass and gold contribute just 4% of the total GHG emissions associated with the perovskite solar cell for a three-time reuse case.

Abstract: In this paper, the paraffin/sepiolite composites were fabricated as novel shape-stable phase change materials (SSPCMs) by vacuum impregnation for thermal energy storage. The structure-property relationships and comprehensive performance of sepiolite-based composite SSPCMs prepared with/without treatment of sepiolite from three mineral deposits were investigated. Compared with the natural sepiolite (SEP), the sepiolite after the purification and acidification treatment (TSEP) is a more suitable supporting carrier for paraffin wax. The prepared paraffin/TSEP composite SSPCM exhibits a significant promotion in absorption mass of paraffin and phase change latent heat. The maximum increase in latent heat of melt and crystallization is 78.32 % and 77.47 %. Simultaneously, the prepared sepiolite-based SSPCMs can reach up to 35.18 % paraffin loading. Its highest latent heat of melting and freezing is 60.12 J/g and 57.09 J/g, respectively, and the relative enthalpy efficiency is as high as 94.45 %. In addition, the sepiolite-based composite SSPCMs show good thermal stability and chemical stability according to the thermal cycling test. Moreover, it is demonstrated that sepiolite-based SSPCMs can slow down the spread of heat by absorbing heat energy and have reliable energy storage and temperature regulation performance. Therefore, the inexpensive and abundant sepiolite can be applied in phase change materials for waste heat recovery and temperature regulation.

Abstract: Fascin, one of actin bundling proteins, plays an important role in the cross-linking of actin filaments (F-actin). Phosphorylation of Fascin is an important posttranslational modification to affect its structure and function. For example, a phosphomimetic mutation of Fascin-S39D decrease its bundling ability with F-actin significantly. In this paper, we studied the actin-bundling activity of Fascin by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biochemical methods. All single-site mutations from serine/threonine to aspartic acid were mimicked by MD simulations. For five mutants (S146D, S156D, S218D, T239D and S259D), the mutated residues in domain 2 of Fascin were found to form salt-bridge interactions with an adjacent residue, indicating that mutations of these residues could potentially reduce actin-bundling activity. Further, F-actin-bundling assays and immunofluorescence technique showed S146D and T239D to have a strong effect on Fascin bundling with F-actin. Finally, we show that single-site mutations do not change the general shape of Fascin, but local structures near the mutated residues in Fascin-S146D and T239D become unstable, thereby affecting the ability of Fascin to bind with F-actin. These findings suggest that targeting domain 2 of Fascin would be very useful for the drug design. In addition, our study indicates that MD simulation is a useful method to screening which residues on Fascin are important.

Abstract: Replacing fossil fuels with alternative energy resources to meet industrial heat demand necessitates using cost-effective thermal energy storage (TES) for efficient and secure operation. Waste-based materials such as industrial by-products, industrial furnace slags, municipal, demolition wastes (DW) offer alternative low cost sensible thermal energy storage materials (STESM) for solar heat industrial applications. The only drawback is their inhomogeneous nature requiring some pre-treatment steps. DW have a great potential as cheap and high performance STESM, if they can be conditioned with optimum properties. In this study, DW samples collected from an urban regeneration project were conditioned with some pre-treatment processes such as crushing, sieving, drying and mixing to produce rigid and homogeneous STESMs. DW powders obtained after processing were characterized to evaluate its suitability to produce STESMs. The results showed that DW powders could be converted to a durable STESM with high storage capacity for use in solar heat industrial applications up to 700 °C.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is the most common cancer in the urinary system which has threatened lives. Increasing evidence has shown that lncRNAs were expressed in cancer cells as a biomarker and might regulate cancer cell development and progression. It was reported that ADAMTS9-AS1 plays a suppressive role in tumor cell growth and proliferation in prostate cancer. However, it remains unclear whether ADAMTS9-AS1 influences the function of bladder cancer cells. In this study, we detected that ADAMTS9-AS1 is highly expressed in bladder cancer. We observed that the up-regulation of ADAMTS9-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and reduced the apoptosis and autophagy of 5637 and T42 cell lines. Meanwhile, the down-regulation of ADAMTS9-AS1 increased the apoptosis and autophagy, and suppressed their proliferation, migration and invasion. Interestingly, the up-regulation of ADAMTS9-AS1 was accompanied by the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, while the down-regulation of ADAMTS9-AS1 lead to an opposite effect. Together, these results demonstrated that ADAMTS9-AS1 promotes bladder cancer cell invasion and migration, and negatively regulates bladder cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy, which might be through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Targeting ADAMTS9-AS1 might become a potential therapeutic approach in treating bladder cancer.

Abstract: We determined the density of defect states of poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si junctions featuring a wet chemical interfacial oxide from lifetime measurements using the MarcoPOLO model to calculate recombination and contact resistance in poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si-junctions. In samples that did not receive any hydrogen treatment, the Dit,cSi is about 2 × 1012 cm−2 eV⁻1 before firing and rises to 3–7 × 1012 cm⁻2 eV⁻1 during firing at measured peak temperatures between 620 °C and 863 °C. To address the question of why AlOx/SiNy stacks in contrast to pure SiNy layers for hydrogenation during firing provides better passivation quality, we have measured the hydrogen concentrations at the poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si interface as a function of AlOx layer thickness and compared these to J0 and calculated Dit,c-Si values. We observe an increase of the hydrogen concentration at the SiOx/c-Si interface upon firing as a function of the firing temperature that exceeds the defect concentrations at the interface several times. However, the AlOx layer thickness appears to cause an increase in hydrogen concentration at the SiOx/c-Si interface in these samples rather than exhibiting a hydrogen blocking property.

Abstract: Insulin resistance (IR) is a state when the physiological amount of insulin is not sufficient to evoke proper action, that is, glucose uptake. Numerous conditions lead to IR, including epigenetic components. Epigenetic modifications, associated with obesity and IR are one of the main mechanisms leading to IR pathogenesis. The adipose tissue samples (subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT)) were collected during abdominal surgery from 40 patients of a wide range of BMI, age, and insulin resistance ratios (F = 9, M = 31). IR was induced in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and human adipocytes collected from SAT and VAT of healthy subjects. Global and site-specific histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac) were determined. We found lower histone modifications in adipose tissue of IR patients. Furthermore, numerous genes regulating insulin action (PPARG, SLC2A4, ADIPOQ) were differently marked by histone methylation and acetylation. Moreover, we noticed that epigenetic changes appear as soon as 72 h following IR induction. The epigenetic changes appeared to be mediated through the SIRT family. Based on obtained results, the histone marks related to insulin resistance mostly concerned PPARG and SLC2A4 genes. Furthermore, our results proved a vital role of the SIRT family in insulin action and IR pathogenesis.

Abstract: Low thermal conductivity and corrosion problem of NaNO3 salt-based phase change materials (PCMs) are regarded as two critical barriers for their applications in thermal energy storage. To address the above problem, a diatomite-based porous ceramic modified by CaCO3 was firstly used to develop shape-stabilized NaNO3 in this work. Particularly, contribution of modified diatomite-based ceramic on improving thermal conductivity of the composite was investigated. Compared with traditional diatomite-based skeleton, diatomite-based ceramic was found to contribute to a 129% higher thermal conductivity of composites, benefited by the generation of a dense and continuous skeleton that consisted of newly formed cristobalite phase with a higher thermal conductivity. While crack occurred on the composite with diatomite-based ceramic after 100 thermal cycles, resulting in the leakage of salt and the decrease of thermal conductivity. By contrast, diatomite-based ceramic modified by no more than 40 wt% CaCO3 effectively avoided the crack of composites, exhibiting quite a stability in shape and thermal conductivity during 500 thermal cycles. The modified ceramic was shown to improve the thermal conductivity of loaded NaNO3 by 118%, up to 1.22 W/(m·K) at 25 °C. The results also indicated that the modified ceramic hardly changed the phase transition temperature of NaNO3, but decreased the latent heat of composites, while possessed a much higher capacity to load salt (57 wt% NaNO3) than that of other porous ceramics. The composite with modified ceramic was demonstrated to have a good cycling stability in thermal properties as well, which performed a considerable potential in thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the investigation of minority carrier traps (traps) is a useful method to study defects in silicon wafers. In this paper, we report the presence of traps in p-type multicrystalline silicon with a photoconductance decay time constant of 1.9 ± 0.4 s (at 30 °C). It is shown that the density of traps is significantly reduced after firing. However, this reduction in trap density is metastable, and it recovers by short dark annealing at 100 °C or after several days of storage at room temperature. In contrast, laser annealing is shown to eliminate the traps in fired wafers, while no change in the trap density is observed for wafers that have not been fired. Further dark annealing of those wafers does not recover the traps, suggesting that this trap annihilation is not reversible.

Abstract: Modern solar cell designs include an always larger variety of elements and additional layers. This approach is usually successful and leads to the development of increasingly efficient materials. However, scientifically, it makes the drawing of accurate conclusions always more challenging, due to the growing number of elements, possible defects, interfaces, and barriers. To try and remedy this problem, we developed a novel way to investigate solar cells by representing bias dependent admittance spectroscopy (CVf) measurement data in the form of a 2D loss map. In this contribution, we elaborate how this technique can be used experimentally, present some concrete results we obtained from measurements on ultra-thin CIGS solar cells and explain how they can be interpreted. We identify 3 major response domains on our typical CVf loss maps. One at high frequency that covers most of the bias range and can be related to series resistance. One at low frequency, mostly visible at strong positive and negative biases, which is related to shunt and dissipation. The last response domain, close to 100 kHz and impacting most of the bias range, can be identified as a defect response of the material. Using CVf measurements on samples with KF post deposition treatment, known for its grain boundary passivation properties, and samples that were previously submitted to accelerated lifetime testing in damp heat conditions, the impact of bulk defects, grain boundaries and conduction band offsets are investigated.

Abstract: Recent developments in CdTe solar cell technology have included the incorporation of ternary alloy Cd(Se,Te) in the devices. CdTe absorber band gap grading due to Se alloying contributes to current density enhancement and can result in device performance improvement. Here we report Cd(Se,Te) polycrystalline thin films grown by a chamberless inline atmospheric pressure metal organic chemical vapour deposition technique, with subsequent incorporation in CdTe solar cells. The compositional dependence of the crystal structure and optical properties of Cd(Se,Te) are examined. Selenium graded Cd(Se,Te)/CdTe absorber structure in devices are demonstrated using either a single CdSe layer or CdSe/Cd(Se,Te) bilayer (with or without As doping in the Cd(Se,Te) layer). Cross-sectional TEM/EDS, photoluminescence spectra and secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of a graded Se profile toward the back contact with a diffusion length of ~1.5 μm and revealed back-diffusion of Group V (As) dopants from the CdTe layer into Cd(Se,Te) grains. Due to the strong Se/Te interdiffusion, CdSe in the Se bilayer configuration was unable to form an n-type emitter layer in processed devices. In situ As doping of the Cd(Se,Te) layer benefited the device junction quality with current density reaching 28.3 mA/cm2. The results provide useful insights for the optimisation of Cd(Se,Te)/CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: Background
The occurrence of recurrence and metastasis after treatment is a major challenge in the treatment of gastric cancer. This study was based on the methionine (Met)-dependent characteristics of gastric cancer cells to explore the effect of Met deficiency on the occurrence and development of gastric cancer.
Methods
Human gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and AGS and nude mice model were used to explore how Met affects gastric cancer by regulating lncRNA PVT1.
Results
The levels of lncRNA PVT1 in gastric cancer cells and human gastric cancer xenografts of nude mice were down-regulated under the condition of Met deficiency. The cell viability and cell proliferation were declined after MKN45 and SGC-790 cells were cultured in Met-deficient medium. LncRNA PVT1 could affect BNIP3 promoter DNA methylation level through its interaction with DNMT1. Moreover, the silence of lncRNA PVT1 and the up-regulation of BNIP3 level inhibited the gastric cancer cell proliferation. Met deficiency could up-regulate BNIP3 expression by inhibiting the binding of lncRNA PVT1 to DNMT1, and activate mitophagy, thus inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation.
Conclusion
Our study suggested that Met deficiency could down-regulate the expression of lncRNA PVT1, further demethylated the promoter of BNIP3, thus inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by activating mitophagy.

Abstract: In this paper, a two-dimensional cellular automata (CA) method is used to simulate the corrosion behavior of Fe–Cr–Ni alloy in NaCl–CaCl2 molten salt. Simulation results and experimental measurements show good agreement, revealing the detailed change and migration of components in the corrosion process of Fe–Cr–Ni alloy in molten chloride salt over time. The simulation revealed that the grain size, elemental composition of the alloy, and O2 and H2O contents in the molten salt are important factors that significantly affect the corrosivity of the NaCl–CaCl2 molten salt with respect to the Fe–Cr–Ni alloy. Additionally, the CA method shortens the period of experimental research and the progression of corrosion is predicted.

Abstract: Converting solar energy into electricity is highly appealing for portable wearable devices. Herein, an facile low-temperature in situ interface polymerization is proposed to fabricate poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber film (PAN-PEDOT). Owing to the synergy of PEDOT and fabric light traps, the fabricated PAN-PEDOT owns excellent photo-thermoelectric performances with a power factor of ~256.61 nWm−1 k−2. Accordingly, a photo-thermoelectric harvester assembled by the optimum PAN-PEDOT strip and the copper wires reached a 0.17 mV voltage output under infrared (IR) light. Furthermore, a flexible textile solar panel assembled using the optimum PAN-PEDOT and the conductive nanofiber films were placed under an IR lamp and sunlight to investigate its performance in on-body applications. Results showed that the solar panel can obtain a voltage outputs of 1.39 mV and 0.56 mV and a power outputs of 0.37 nW and 0.06 nW under an IR lamp and sunlight, respectively. Therefore, the photo-thermoelectric fabric has high potential in solar-to-heat and solar-to-electricity applications.

Abstract: Molten salts have favorable features to serve as thermal energy storage (TES) media, and their nano-sized capsules are advantageous for efficient TES. However, their high water solubility hinders encapsulation by conventional methods, such as the sol–gel process. In this study, a binary nitrate molten salt mixture (NaNO3 and KNO3 in 60:40 mass ratio) was nanoencapsulated by a silica (SiO2) shell using emulsification and sol–gel techniques. The diameters of the molten salt capsules were controlled from a few micrometers to several hundred nanometers by regulating the stirring intensity and surfactant dosage during the synthesis process. Based on differential scanning calorimetry measurements, the encapsulation ratio and encapsulation efficiency were calculated 50.6% and 50.0%, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that the thermally stable SiO2 shell enhances the decomposition temperature of the binary nitrate salt mixture. Finally, the proposed nanoencapsulation protocol was also utilized to encapsulate a different nitrate salt mixture (NaNO3 and KNO3 in 80:20 mass ratio) and two single nitrate salts (NaNO3 and KNO3). This was done to validate both its applicability to all nitrate salt mixtures and the consistency of the chemical composition in each nanocapsule. The achievement for these nitrates suggests the possibility of comprehensive nanoencapsulation of water-soluble materials.

Abstract: Background
Structural remodeling plays an important role in the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is currently unclear. This study was designed to investigate the transcriptomic mechanism of structural remodeling of AF through bioinformatic analysis and in vivo and vitro experiments.
Methods
Transcriptomic datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and bioinformatics analysis was performed to screen mRNAs associated with AF. Cell and animal models were constructed to verify the bioinformatic findings using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Then, SPP1 was screened as the target gene, and the mechanism by which it promotes fibrosis was further studied in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) using western blot analysis.
Results
After retrieval, the GSE14975, GSE31821, GSE79768, GSE115574 and GSE128188 datasets were used in this study. In total, 147 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in left atrial appendix tissue and 85 in right atrial appendix tissue. According to the enrichment analysis results, the calcium signaling pathway was found to play an important role in AF, in which EGFR, AGTR1, HTR2B, CD38 and BDKRB1 might be the key genes. Moreover, SPP1 was identified as a key driver through PPI analysis and experimentally proved to reduce the expression of p27 by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, sequentially promoting HCF fibrosis.
Conclusion
Bioinformatics analysis showed that the calcium signaling pathway might play an important role in AF, while SPP1 could promote myocardial fibrosis through the PI3K/Akt/p27 signaling axis.

Abstract: Solar-driven interface steam generation is rapidly emerging as a water purification technology. However, an efficient and facile method to fabricate high-performance and flexible solar evaporators and simultaneously prevent salt accumulation for portable applications is still a challenge. Herein, a super-hydrophilic, conformal and robust Cu-based metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) absorber coating is strongly immobilized on the commercial textile surface by using sputtered Cu film as a bonding layer, which ensures strong adhesion between the textile substrate and Cu-MOF coating. Benefiting from the excellent capillary effect and powerful water pumping capability, no salt accumulation was observed on the upper surface of Cu-MOF photothermal textile (CMPT) even at a salinity of 9.5 wt% for over 12 h during evaporation. Together with superior light absorptance (95.9%), originating from unique light trapping hierarchical structure of Cu-MOF, and superb air permeability, the CMPT achieved a high evaporation rate of 1.52 kg/m2 h under one sun irradiation and simultaneous salt rejection during vapors generation. Moreover, owing to the outstanding structural design, the CMPT possesses high flexibility, superior mechanical strength and excellent chemical stability under harsh environments. The current study presents a simple and straightforward approach for surface-immobilized MOF-coating on textile fibers for practical applications in portable solar steam generators.

Abstract: Solar-assisted steam generation is considered as an environmental-friendly and feasible technology to effectively harvest solar energy, which has been widely in water purification, seawater desalination and steam sterilization. In this work, we demonstrated flexible and scalable double-layered photothermal material (named as ppy-RF) based on phenolic aldehyde foam and polypyrrole coating as a light adsorption layer for solar steam generation. The resulting ppy-RF foam possessed interpenetrated and macroporous network with high porosity (>86%), superhydrophilicity, low thermal conductivity (0.0396 W m-1 K-1) and almost 100% absorbance (500-2500 nm). These characteristics make ppy-RF foam rapid water transportation and steam generation with an energy conversion efficiency of 90% under solar illumination of 1 kW h-1. Furthermore, the ppy-RF foam exhibits outstanding salt-resistant performance and long-term stability for desalination even in high salinity brine (20 wt%). By combination of its porous, flexible and monolithic configuration obtained by a simple and scalable fabrication method with efficient solar-thermal conversion ability and salt-resistance, the ppy-RF foam shows great potential in the application of clean water production and brine desalination.

Abstract: In this study we analyze the properties of silicone elastomers used in the fabrication of PV modules in the early 1980's, which were in operation outdoors in a semi-tropical climate for more than 20 years. We observe that the silicone materials have very similar properties to recent, freshly cured silicone. The information gathered gives evidence that silicone elastomers undergo only very limited degradation after years of exposure in the field in operating PV modules. A moderate decrease in elastic modulus was observed, but further studies are needed to determine whether this effect is real. The very limited degradation of silicone encapsulant is consistent with the low performance decrease reported in other studies.

Abstract: Solar energy radiation during the midday could causes the internal temperature of building rising, thus resulting in a significant source of power consumption to run air conditioner devices for thermal comfort environment. A growing interest developed in phase change materials (PCMs) applied in building envelope owing to the prevailing energy challenges. A new type of shape-stabilized composite phase change material (CPCM) was developed by introducing a novel Na2HPO4·12H2O–K2HPO4·3H2O (DSP-PPDT) eutectic hydrated salt into super absorbent polymer (SAP), which was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results indicated that DSP-PPDT eutectic hydrated salts in various ratios all can be formed, among which DSP-PPDT eutectic hydrated salt with the mass fraction of PPDT at 25% had a melting temperature of 24.26 °C, making it suitable for building envelope. The results of cooling tests suggested that 2% of Na2SiO3·9H2O nucleating agent could reduce the supercooling degree of the eutectic hydrated salt to 0.79 °C. The modified eutectic hydrated salt could be stabilized in the network structure of SAP at a mass fraction of 12% through physical interaction without leakage, which melted at 24.13 °C with the enthalpy of 172.7 J/g and had enhanced thermal stability, good thermal reliability at 100 thermal cycles as well as low thermal conductivity of 0.474 W/(m·K). The good thermal performances of CPCM make it a promising candidate applied in building envelope.

Abstract: Corrosion and low thermal conductivity are considered as two great challenges for the application of salts-based phase change materials (PCMs). To address these problems, a novel skeleton, namely SiC modified diatomite-based porous ceramic, was prepared to develop form-stable NaNO3 salt. The results showed that a good wettability and chemical compatibility existed between SiC and molten NaNO3. Thermal conductivity of composite PCMs was found to be nearly linearly related with the concentration of SiC. 20% SiC added into the skeleton helped to enhance thermal conductivity of composites by 50%, benefited by the formation of a high thermally conductive heat transfer path. A smaller particle size of SiC contributed to a higher thermal conductivity of composites by increasing the heat transfer area between PCMs and skeleton. Form-stable NaNO3 (56.6%) that had a skeleton modified by 10% SiC (only 4.3% in composites) with particle size of 50 nm possessed a thermal conductivity of 2.06 W/(m·K) at 25 °C, which was 265% higher than that of pure NaNO3. Such composites also performed quite a good stability during the 500 thermal cycles, in terms of chemical compatibility, thermal conductivity, latent heat, phase transition temperature, and mechanical strength. Therefore, the novel composite PCMs exhibited a great application prospect in thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The zinc (Zn) diffusion effects on metal–organic chemical vapor deposition grown flexible inverted metamorphic (IMM) GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs triple junction solar cell performance have been investigated. By studying electrical and spectral properties of solar cells with different configuration, it was found out that the Zn diffusion from GaAs middle cell AlGaAs:Zn back surface field (BSF) layer into AlGaAs/GaAs tunnel junction is the main reason for I–V curve inflection and low fill factor. Besides, the thermal annealing effects caused by the long epitaxial growth time also has significant effect on Zn diffusion and degrades the overall cell performance. These adverse effects caused by Zn diffusion was suppressed by replacing Zn with carbon as the p-type dopant source in BSF layer, and the thermal annealing effects was solved by fine tuning InGaAs bottom subcell base layer thickness. A large area, 4 × 2 cm2, flexible IMM GaInP/GaAs/InGaAs triple junction solar cell with 34.52% efficiency under AM 1.5D solar spectrum has been successfully fabricated.

Abstract: The utilization of solar thermal collectors has increased significantly in the last decade. The heat transfer fluids that is used in the design of these systems has notable effects on their performance. The recent discoveries of hybridized nanofluids, give a promising approach for investigating the performance of parabolic trough collectors (PTC), especially at different design conditions and environmental parameters. This study investigates the thermodynamic performance of a Kalina cycle incorporated with a parabolic trough collector that utilizes ternary nanofluid as a heat transfer fluid. The use of mono, hybrid and ternary nanofluids (THNF) in the parabolic trough collector is examined based on their impact on the efficiency of thermal system. The nanofluids considered are Al2O3, Al2O3–Fe, Al2O3–ZnO, and CuO–MgO–TiO2. The performance of integrated cycle based on the effect of solar irradiation and volume fraction of the nanofluids are studied and compared with conventional fluids namely: thermal VP1 oil, DowThermal oil, and Salt (7NaNO3, 40NaNO2, 53KNO2). In addition, an optimization study is conducted using genetic algorithm to maximize the net power output of the Kalina cycle and the exergetic efficiency of overall system. The results showed that performance of the system which uses nanofluids as a working fluid was higher than the systems using conventional fluids. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that maximum net power output of the system is recorded when Al2O3, Al2O3–Fe, Al2O3–ZnO, and CuO–MgO–TiO2 nanoparticles are used. The power outputs were evaluated as 59.72 kW, 56.64 kW, 54.54 kW, and 61.21 kW respectively. The optimization study reveals that the optimum exergetic efficiency when Al2O3, Al2O3–Fe, Al2O3–ZnO, and CuO–MgO–TiO2 nanofluids are used can reach up to 21.0%, 17.2%, 10.8%, and 25.1% respectively.

Abstract: Accumulating evidences suggest that the composition and functional roles of ribosomes are heterogeneous in cells, partly due to the temporal-spatial expression of paralogous ribosomal proteins (RPs), of which functional relationships remain largely unexplored. In mouse, the X chromosome-linked RPL39 and its male germline specific paralog RPL39L are thought to express mutually exclusively due to the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, hinders the understanding of their functional relationships. In the present study, we investigated the expression and functional relations of Rpl39 and Rpl39l in a proliferative mouse cell line, in which both genes are expressed simultaneously, with the expression level of Rpl39 higher than that of Rpl39l. Disruption of Rpl39 via CRISPR/Cas9 method caused decreased cell proliferation, nascent protein synthesis and altered mitochondrial functions, whereas double mutations of Rpl39 and Rpl39l augmented these phenotypes, suggesting that both RPs contribute to the cellular physiology. Consistently, overexpression of Rpl39, Rpl39l or an alanine mutant of RPL39, rescued cell proliferation similarly in Rpl39-/-::Rpl39l-/- dual gene null cells. Deletion of Rpl39l induced compensatory expression of Rpl39, rendering the deleterious effects of Rpl39l mutation. Supporting this, Rpl39l mutation was more detrimental to cells under a low serum condition, under which the compensatory expression of Rpl39 was inhibited. Moreover, the low serum condition induced expression of both genes, suggesting that they possess stress responsive roles. Taken together, these data indicate that both RPL39 and RPL39L influence cell proliferation via protein synthesis and mitochondrial functions, suggesting a link between protein translation and cellular metabolism through these ribosomal protein paralogs.

Abstract: Traditional metallic contacts on solar cells can cover a substantial portion of the device area, resulting in shadowing of light that diminishes the amount of current collected. In this paper, we developed trapezoidal electron-beam evaporated Ti/Al front grid fingers on GaAs single-junction solar cells to decrease the optical shadowing and increase the photogenerated current. We observe a high fill factor of 87% at 1-Sun light intensity and we observe no degradation on the open-circuit voltage. The short-circuit current density is found to increase by 0.4 mA/cm2 when compared to previously demonstrated electroplated Ni/Au front grid fingers, resulting in an efficiency improvement of ~0.8% absolute.

Abstract: Background
Glioma is the most prevalent brain tumor with high mortality and morbidity and the prognosis of patients remains very poor. Glioma therapy is largely limited by the extraordinary invasive capability in glioma and the lack of valuable biomarkers of LGG and GBM. So it is urgent and important for us to identify valuable biomarkers to treat glioma patients. SCAMP4 (Secretory Carrier-Associated Membrane Protein 4) has not been reported to be linked to cancer prognostic or any treatments.
Methods
We analyzed the role of SCAMP4 in LGG and GBM via the publicly available CGGA (The Chinese Glioma Atlas) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) databases. The correlations between SCAMP4 and the immune cells were analyzed by applying CIBERSORT and TIMER, while R was utilized in the analysis of the statistical data.
Results
Our results indicated that SCAMP4 which is correlated to age, stage, grade and tumor status and may be a promising independent prognostic factor in LGG and GBM. Meanwhile, the expression of SCAMP4 is closely associated with some tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as Monocytes, NK cells activated, Macrophages, Mast cells resting and so on. Furthermore, during the in-depth analysis of the integrated correlations, we also find that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and SCAMP4 shared similar prognostic values.
Conclusions
Together with all these findings, the identification of SCAMP4 as a new biomarker could elucidate how the immune microenvironment influence the glioma development. With further analysis, SCAMP4 may be a predictor for glioma prognosis.

Abstract: Not only do the outstanding electrochromic devices provide a fast switching response, but they can also block light and heat to reduce energy consumption in buildings. Herein, we fabricated an outstanding WO3/NiO nanorods-based electrochromic device consisting of a working electrode of 1D WO3 nanorods/ITO/glass substrate and a counter electrode of 1D NiO nanorods/ITO/glass substrate. The 1D NiO nanorods with a large surface area act as an ion storage layer, which can offer a huge number of electrons to form small polarons and the localized surface plasmon resonance on the 1D WO3 nanorods. The high small polaron content causes strong lattice distortion, which helps the Li+ ions easily diffuse into the 1D WO3 nanorods and gives the 1D WO3/NiO nanorods-based electrochromic device excellent electrochromic characteristics. The electrochromic characteristics include high optical transmittance difference (~61, ~89 %), high coloration efficiency (174, 386 cm2/C) and fast coloration/bleaching switching times (~2.05/~0.74 s, ~0.85/~1.0 s) at the wavelengths of 680 and 1000 nm, respectively. These characteristics make the WO3/NiO nanorods-based electrochromic device a very promising smart window candidate for lighting control and energy-saving applications.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, ranging from benign steatosis to severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Recently, it has been found that lipophagy plays a pivotal role in lipid turnover, which can alleviate NAFLD in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that a highly sulfated glucuronomannan hexamer G6S1 has the ability to enhance lipophagy. When treated with G6S1, the number and the size of lipid droplet (LD) decreased significantly on hepatocytes AML12 cells. Western blot results showed that the expressions of the lipolysis-related proteins increased, while the expressions of proteins that is responsible for lipid transportation and synthesis exhibited no significant change. Immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy results showed an increase of autophagy related protein expression level and lysosome number in hepatocytes treated with G6S1, suggesting that G6S1 could also promote lipophagy. A significant increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) expression level was detected in G6S1 treated cells, suggesting that G6S1 may promote autophagy via enhancing the expression of PPARα. In addition, these effects could be inhibited after treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and PPARα inhibitor MK-886. These findings indicate that G6S1 can promote lipophagy via enhanced PPARα expression and can result in a slowdown of lipids accumulation.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA NORAD has been identified in human solid tumors. However, the expression profile of NORAD and its clinical implications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. The current study aimed to explore the NORAD expression status and its clinical significance in non-M3 AML patients.
Methods
NORAD expression was evaluated in 60 de novo non-M3 AML patients and 49 healthy individuals using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction method. The correlation between NORAD transcription levels and clinicopathologic characteristics was statistically studied.
Results
Compared with the healthy controls, NORAD was consistently higher in non-M3 AML patients (p = .01). Furthermore, initial NORAD upregulation occurred more frequently in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic risk (p = .02). The non-M3 AML patients were divided into NORAD high-expressing (NORADhigh) and NORAD low-expressing (NORADlow) groups based on the median NORAD expression level. Univariate analyses revealed that patients with high expression levels of NORAD had relatively poor overall survival (p = .03) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = .01). Additionally, multivariate analysis highlighted that NORAD upregulation was an independent risk factor for RFS.
Conclusion
Our observations indicate the fact that high expression of NORAD could be an unfavorable risk factor in non-M3 AML patients, and NORAD might be a novel therapeutic candidate for future treatments targeting AML.

Abstract: In recent years, there is a growing interest in reducing the various losses occurring at the rear surface of passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) silicon solar cells through process optimization including chemical polishing, dielectric passivation and contact geometry etc. to realize the possible improvements in power conversion efficiency. In this contribution, a detailed investigation on recombination and resistive losses at rear surface of PERC solar cells using advanced imaging techniques for spatial distribution and allied characterization approaches are performed for better understanding of loss mechanisms and possible routes for their mitigation. Our analysis identifies that spreading resistance (Rspr) and reverse saturation current density due to first diode (J01) are the two key parameters in quantifying the efficiency improvement in PERC solar cells. For rear dielectric opening of 45 μm, optimized circular contact geometry was found to exhibit lower Rspr, as well as J01, when compared with the linear scheme. Our calculation also suggests an additional possible improvement of absolute 1.29% in power conversion efficiency through appropriate selection of starting wafer resistivity and improved passivation uniformity across the solar cell area.

Abstract: Sand has been utilized as a sensible thermal energy storage medium, heat transfer material, and solar absorber material for different solar thermal technologies. In this study, we examine Arabian desert sands (Nafud, Dahna, and southwestern AlRub’AlKhali deserts) to identify optimal thermal energy storage and solar radiation absorption properties. Samples were grouped into three classes: quartzose feldspar-bearing (AlRub’AlKhali desert), quartzose carbonate-bearing (eastern Dahna corridor), and pure quartzose sands (occupying most of Nafud and Dahna deserts). Feldspar in quartzose sand causes a decrease in specific heat capacity, decrease in vitrifying temperature, and decrease in spectral absorbance relative to pure quartzose sand. Calcite in quartzose sand causes a significant reduction of specific heat capacity, change in grain-size distribution, and decrease in spectral absorbance relative to pure quartzose sand. The purest quartzose sands (≥99% quartz) have the best thermo-physical and thermo-optical properties. These pure quartzose sands have the highest specific heat capacity, do not agglomerate up to 1200 °C, and have the highest spectral absorbance after heating to 1200 °C. The purest quartzose sands occupy the southwestern part of the Nafud desert. Sand of this area is proposed to be the best candidate of all Arabian sands to be used as a sensible thermal energy storage medium and solar absorber material.

Abstract: In this work, the relation between the photovoltaic and resistive switching (RS) properties of metal-oxide-semiconductor devices containing Si nanocrystal (Si NC) superlattices is investigated. A first approximation concludes that the low resistance state achieved by the RS process allows for enhanced photogenerated carrier extraction when compared to the high resistance state and pristine devices. By using different current compliance values during the electroforming process, the low resistance state is further modified, improving its conductivity and the collection probability of photogenerated carriers. Conversion efficiency is enhanced by at least one and up to five orders of magnitude by applying different electroforming processes. In addition to promoting the RS properties in these devices, spectral response measurements demonstrate that Si NCs are partially responsible for the optical absorption, and that their contribution is maintained after electroforming. We thus conclude that the proposed methodology can improve the conversion efficiency of this and other multijunction solar cells or structures that also exhibit RS properties. Through RS, a dense network of conductive filaments is promoted in the insulating region, which reduces the travel distance of photocarriers for their collection.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage using salt hydrates is a promising method to store low-grade heat and resolve the mismatch between supply and demand of renewable energy sources. In this study, the hydration reaction kinetics of the salt, SrCl2 and its composite with cement were investigated experimentally as a potential heat storage material. Characterization of the materials were performed in a humidity chamber under various water vapour partial pressures and temperatures. Firstly, a reaction kinetics model was developed for the hydration of SrCl2 to SrCl2·6H2O. Secondly, a shrinking-core model was developed to describe the behaviour of two sizes of a spherical SrCl2-cement composite. The shrinking-core model for salt in a cement porous host matrix combines chemical reaction and moisture diffusion to define the overall reaction rate. These kinetic models can be used to predict the performance of a packed bed thermochemical energy storage system.

Abstract: Black titania is an attractive applicant as a narrow bandgap absorber in photovoltaic cells. However, the non-equivalency between the amount of visible light absorbed and the photocatalytic activities limits its usage as photoanodes in the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, the synthesized black titania (BT) via imidazole at 400oC; without washing steps, produces not only Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 nanoparticles but also allows the formation of the C3N4 nanosheets; which is emphasized via XRD, TEM-SAED-IFFT, FTIR, CV and XPS studies. The BT incorporated with hole transporting metals including Ag2O, CuO and Ag2S; at 3% loading, synthesized by deposition precipitation route are also fabricated to form p-n junction interfaces. The best conversion efficiency attained when using Ag2O/BT was 6%; that presented the highest IPCE% in the visible light margin of 500–750 nm, followed by CuO (5.6%) and BT (4.9%). Although Ag2O/BT did not absorb visible light as CuO, however, it offers minimum optical and electronic losses. Besides, it gives the highest dielectric constant (ε′) value subsequent BT and exposes numerous active sites. Well correlations with vibrational, surface texturing, permittivity and electrical conductivity were achieved and discussed to have a view on the effect of the C3N4 interface as well as oxygen defect sites and the incorporation with metal oxide/sulfide groups. This work supplies a new aspect in the synthesis of g-C3N4 while synthesizing the oxygen deficient TiO2-x in solar energy conversion reactions.

Abstract: Degradation of backsheets (BSs) and encapsulant polymer components of silicon PV modules is recognized as one of the main reasons for losses in PV plant performance and lifetime expectations. Here, we report initial insights into the correlation between BS composition of PV-modules and PV power station performance by using a combination of lab- and field-imaging, as well as spectroscopic and electrical characterizations. Using field-suitable near-infrared absorption (NIRA) spectroscopy, the BS structure of 518 PV-modules, 2.5 % of the PV-modules in a 5 MWp PV power station, was identified on-site. The variance of the BS composition was found to be heterogeneous across PV-modules of the same power class from the same manufacturer. Polyamide-based BSs cause in 10 out of 100 inverters ground impedance values below 400 kΩ, which is a typical threshold for inverters connecting to the grid. For fluorinated coating-based BSs this low value is reached 20 times. We conclude these numbers best as possible from the available monitoring data of inverters associated with BS-types from NIRA. The identification of degraded coating-based BSs is challenging, since visually they look healthy and undistinguishable to well performing BSs. The present results demonstrate that a deeper understanding of the relationship between bill-of-materials and performance of PV-modules is necessary to avoid/minimize inverter shut-downs, and that it can be achieved by using combinations of selected field and lab characterization methods with monitoring data.

Abstract: Anticancer effect of resveratrol and the role of sodium/lithium/calcium exchanger in context with calcium ions are studied in human cervical cancer cell line. This therapeutic approach using siNCLX mediated gene silencing and drug therapy with resveratrol indicates the disruption of calcium homeostasis, increase in caspase (-3, 8, 9) mRNA expressions and DNA damage leading to apoptotic cell death. Monitoring the intracellular Ca2+ changes using fluo-4AM indicates highest rise in [Ca2+] level in sodium/lithium/calcium exchanger silenced group with five different stages, that is distinguishable based on the fluorescence intensity. In resveratrol treated and siNCLX + resveratrol treated groups no such cell staging differences were observed, despite uniform Ca2+ rise followed by decrease in the intensity. Integrating RNAi gene silencing of sodium/lithium/calcium exchanger with resveratrol can form the most interesting, efficient and promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Flexible transparent conductive electrodes (FTCEs) have received a great deal of attention for various applications due to their versatile ability. To demonstrate high-performance of FTCEs, numerous efforts have been focused on high conductivity, transparency and mechanical durability against bending. However, it is still a challenge for FTCEs to apply in foldable applications due to the degradation of electrical conductivity during folding. In this paper, high-performance FTCEs with folding-insensitivity are achieved by embedding copper nanowires (Cu NWs) into polymethyl methacrylate strategy via simple sol-gel transition. The prepared film demonstrates a very high transmittance of ~94 % with a low sheet resistance of 56.3 Ω/sq. In particular, excellent insensitivity conductivity are achieved with a bending radius of 2.5 μm and the resistance remains nearly to be constant after 1000 folding cycles with a bending radius of 50 μm. Moreover, the film shows a good stability to resist long-term storage and ultrasonication. Finally, flexible transparent heater is fabricated based on the FTCEs, the immediate response make it have a great promise to be used as defrost, antifog and (light emitting diode) LED devices.

Abstract: Solar heating (SH) and Radiative sky cooling (RSC) have been recognized as remarkable renewable energy technologies due to their great energy-saving potential. Recently, the combination of SH and RSC (i.e., SH-RSC) has been proposed and developed since the SH-RSC hybrid utilization can harness heat and cold from the sun and universe directly using a single system. At present, polyethylene (PE) film has been widely used in the SH-RSC system as the wind cover, but it is flimsy and easy to age. Here, we demonstrate a rigid spectral selective cover for the SH-RSC system. The cover consists of bulk zinc sulfide (ZnS) and ZnS/ytterbium fluoride (YbF3) anti-reflective multilayer coatings on both sides of the bulk ZnS. Spectral characterization shows that the fabricated ZnS-based cover has high transmissivity of 0.86 and 0.89 within the solar radiation band and the atmospheric window, respectively. Moreover, with the rigid ZnS cover, the gap between the cover and the absorber can be achieved to be vacuum condition to maximally reduce the intrinsic energy loss and improve the performance of the SH-RSC system. The thermal analysis demonstrates that the ZnS cover-based vacuum SH-RSC system shows a thermal efficiency of 43.9% at a temperature of 80 °C in SH mode and a maximum temperature reduction of 26 °C in RSC mode, which are 17.9% higher and 10.5 °C lower than that of the typical PE cover-based system, respectively. In summary, this ZnS cover provides a choice for enhancing the performance of the hybrid utilization of daytime SH and nighttime RSC processes.

Abstract: In solar applications, the oxidation stability of heat transfer fluidsreducesthe thermal energy storage cost. In this work, the effect of new two azophenols, namely -2-sec-butyl-4-((3-chlorophenyl) diazenyl) phenol and 2-sec-butyl-4-((3-nitrophenyl) diazenyl)phenol, was studied to produce an oil that has good characteristics and is compatible with metals such asstainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum, and copper, which are generally used to manufacture pipes, heat exchangers, receivers, and storage tanks. The prepared compounds were characterized using spectroscopy analysis. The prepared compounds were added to a heat transfer fluid under operating conditions in the presence of iron and copper as catalysts. At different time intervals, the samples were tested by measuring the total acid number value. The results of this measurement show that compound II performed better than compound I. Additionally, the quantum chemical parameters were calculated. The theoretical calculations were compatible with the experimental results.

Charge inside a surface dielectric layer is neutralized in Si leading to an accumulation or inversion layer of free carriers. Additionally, states at the interface are occupied by charges via Shockley-Read-Hall carrier statistics. It is accepted that the density of interface charge near midgap, which can only reach a concentration as high as the density of states, Dit, has a minor effect on band bending compared to the charges in the dielectric for a well passivated interface. Here, we show that it is the state density near the band edge what plays the major role. We conclude this by comparing our measurements with device modelling of a Si/SiO2 interface. We measure the wafer sheet resistance while applying various amounts of positive charge to the passivating dielectric on an n-type Si wafer, and then reproduce the measured resistance values using simulations. This modelling indicates that Dit at midgap has indeed a minor effect on sheet resistance change, while the total amount of tail states has a significant impact on the distribution of induced carriers. We test this model to detect the amount of acceptor-like states at the band-tails of oxide passivated silicon with different processing. We discuss and analyse the limitations of this technique. While we report on the Si/SiO2 interface due to its relevance in photovoltaics, our method can be used to study the properties of other semiconductor-dielectric interfaces. As such this work is of importance across various optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are specialized cells present in many organs where they serve diverse tissue-specific functions. Using the Tabula Muris compendium of single-cell RNA sequencing data, we extracted individual SMC transcriptomes from eight mouse tissues to investigate the transcriptomic landscape of tissue-specific SMCs. We identified marker genes, signaling pathways, and biological processes enriched in tissue-specific SMCs, and inferred potential ligand-receptor interaction between SMC and other cell types. Our analysis also identified sex differences in SMC gene expression in different tissues. Lastly, we used unsupervised clustering to identify novel SMC subtypes based on their downstream targets of transcription factors. Our results highlight the variable SMC phenotypes and underscore this cell’s remarkable adaptability to contribute to diverse tissue function.

Abstract: Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonists could inhibit inflammation in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanism underlying such effect and the potential role of P2 × 7 receptor (P2X7R) remains unclear. In the present study, we examined whether the effect of ERβ activation in IBD rats was related to P2X7R. Overexpression of ERβ using a recombinant lentivirus in IBD rats improved the IBD-like symptoms, including weight loss, disease activity index (DAI) scores, and inflammatory responses. ERβ agonists DPN and ERB-041 attenuated P2X7R expression in macrophages from colitis rats and in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) in response to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP). DPN and ERB-041 also blocked increased production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in the rectocolon of colitis rats. The two ERβ agonists reversed LPS- and ATP-induced up-regulation of P2X7R and its downstream proteins, including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β, in RAW264.7 cells. Also, in both the rectocolon of colitis rats and RAW264.7 cells, ERβ agonists reversed the up-regulation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), but not up-regulation of serine threonine kinase or cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Blockade of JAK2 or STAT3 phosphorylation significantly reduced the ability of DPN to down-regulate P2X7R expression and the ability of ERB-041 and DPN to inhibit IL-1β release from RAW264.7 cells. We found that ERβ and P2X7R co-localized in the macrophages of rat rectocolon and in RAW264.7 cells. Deletion of macrophages from colitis rats with clodronate abolished the inhibitory effect of DPN. These results suggest that ERβ plays an important anti-inflammatory role in IBD rats by down-regulating P2X7R expression and inhibiting IL-1β release from macrophages through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Transactivation response element RNA-binding protein (TRBP or TARBP2) originally identified as a pro-viral cellular protein in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is also a regulator of microRNA biogenesis and cellular stress response. TRBP inhibits the catalytic activity of interferon-induced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) during viral infections and cell stress thereby regulating stress-induced signaling pathways. During cellular stress, PKR is catalytically activated transiently by its protein activator PACT and TRBP inhibits PKR to bring about a timely cellular recovery. We have previously established that TRBP phosphorylated after oxidative stress binds to and inhibits PKR more efficiently promoting cell survival. In this study, we investigated if phosphorylation of TRBP enhances its interaction with PACT to bring about additional PKR inhibition. Our data establishes that phosphorylation of TRBP has no effect on PACT-TRBP interaction and TRBP's inhibitory actions on PKR are mediated exclusively by its enhanced interaction with PKR. Cells lacking TRBP are more sensitive to apoptosis in response to oxidative stress and show persistent PKR activation. These results establish that PKR inhibition by stress-induced TRBP phosphorylation occurs by its direct binding to PKR and is important for preventing apoptosis due to sustained PKR activation.
