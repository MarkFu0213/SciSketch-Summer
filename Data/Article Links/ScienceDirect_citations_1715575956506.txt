Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage based on solid-liquid phase change material has a huge potential in dealing with mismatch between energy demand and supply. LiF–LiCl–Li2CO3 ternary system was screened out for high temperature energy storage material due to its good thermophysical properties. Its eutectic composition (XLiF = 28.41 mol%, XLiCl = 55.09 mol% and XLi2CO3 = 16.50 mol%) was predicted based on the developed thermodynamic model and verified experimentally. The melting point, phase change latent heat, heat capacity, thernal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and thermal stability of LiF–LiCl–Li2CO3 eutectic mixture were measured. And the influence of the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were analyzed. It was found that adding MWCNTs could increase the latent heat, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of LiF–LiCl–Li2CO3 eutectic mixture, while didn't significantly change the melting temperature.

Abstract: Crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules have dominated the photovoltaic market for a long time and the recycling of crystalline silicon PV modules has become a critical issue due to their limited service life. The separation of glass and backsheet bonded by EVA film is critical to the separation of PV modules for the separation of different layers in PV modules is the premise of adequately recycling valuable elements such as Ag, Al, and Si. Traditional separation reagents, such as toluene, O-dichlorobenzene, and trichloroethylene, are all highly toxic which may cause harm to human body and pollute the environment. This paper innovatively proposes using green separation reagent DMPU (N,N′-dimethylpropenylurea, C6H12N2O) to separate different layers in PV modules. Constituents of each layer in the whole were analyzed by using SEM/EDS, XRD, XRF, and FTIR. Effects of different pieces, reaction temperatures, solid-liquid ratios, and ultrasonic powers were then investigated on the separation ratio, glass recovery ratio and backsheet peeling time. Meanwhile, separation comparison between DMPU and toluene on the separation ratio and silicon wafer breaking degree was also studied. Compared with toluene, the solar cell separated by DMPU can keep its initial size which is convenient for further resource recovery. Separation mechanism of different layers caused by DMPU was also studied by SEM, FTIR, and GC-MS. This study has significant implications for developing environmentally friendly and efficient separation reagents for recycling PV modules.

Abstract: The application of cool materials efficiently relieves heat island effect and slows global warming through saving energy, meanwhile the non-white appearance would highlight their applications for avoidable architectural problems and dazzling risk. Since the applied silica (SiO2) was covered with hexamethyldisilazane, it was used for the desired superhydrophobicity. Herein, SiO2 was incorporated with colored pigments, including whitish titanium dioxide (TiO2), greenish chromium trioxide (Cr2O3) and reddish ferric oxide (Fe2O3), to prepare cool colored materials through casting method with the assistance of poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) (SAN) as the matrix. For comparison, Cr2O3 presented high solar reflectance and cooling property as rutile TiO2, which was better than that of Fe2O3. With the simultaneous incorporation of SiO2 and Cr2O3, the sample possessed the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of 73.7%, SRI values higher than 70, and water contact angle of 163°. Thus, cool colored material with superhydrophobicity was successfully fabricated, where the green appearance would highlight its outdoor applicability.

Abstract: In this work, water based ferrofluid with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposite (NC) was investigated for solar photo-thermal energy conversion application. The NC was synthesized via the improved co-precipitation method. The thermal and optical properties of NC ferrofluid were also studied in the concentration range of 0.001–0.2 wt%. The results showed that Fe3O4 NPs connect on the outer walls of the MWCNTs uniformly and the saturation magnetization was found to be 31.26 emu/g. The solar photo-thermal energy conversion performance of the MWCNT/Fe3O4 ferrofluids decreases with the solar radiation time and improves with the concentration. Moreover, the extra magnetic field would further enhance the photo-thermal conversion performance due to absorbed heat is effectively transferred by the axially arranged MWCNTs with ultrahigh thermal conductivity. As a result, the solar photo-thermal conversion efficiency of ferrofluid is 58% at the concentration of 0.01 wt%, and it has 30% enhancement in comparison with the water. Another 6% enhancement would be obtained under the action of magnetic field.

Abstract: The stability of organic solar cells still remains one of the main challenges to make this technology suitable for large scale mass production. The stability of the morphology is one main degradation channel in currently used bulk heterojunction systems. We introduce three different all-in-one donor–acceptor amphiphilic triads and perform molecular dynamics simulations in order investigate the stacking of the donor and acceptor sub-molecules after performing a simulated annealing step. We show that the molecular volume of each sub-molecule of the triad plays an important role for the stability of the π-stacking within the bilayer sheet. Further, we found that TIPS-pentacene and TIPS-tetraazapentacene sub-molecules serving as donor and acceptor, respectively, keep their crystalline nature in the bilayer sheet. Thus, by such a system, charge carrier mobilities in the range of 1 cm2/Vs should be possible, which is three orders of magnitude higher compared to measured mobilities in existing highly efficient organic solar cells. Therefore, by this approach not only the stability can be increased, but also the fill factor and therefore the power conversion efficiency can be improved.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is identified as one of the most promising candidates in smart windows due to its metal-to-insulator transition. Most reported studies concentrated on the improvement of their optical properties in sunlight wavelength, while the significant effect of their emissivity in the mid infrared region (MIR) was rarely studied. Here, we proposed a universal approach to fabricating W - doped VO2 based smart coatings with excellent infrared - shielding ability and good thermochromic performance. The W dopant is used to decrease the phase transition temperature of VO2, and promote the practicability. We believe that the method will attract more attention to MIR properties of VO2 based smart coatings and improve the dynamic temperature management ability significantly.

Abstract: Local Al–Si contacts are a vital part of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cells. They are generally fabricated using laser ablation to open the passivation dielectric layers, which is followed by Al paste printing and high-temperature alloying. However, the alloying process of Al–Si contacts and the formation mechanism of voids remain unclear in parts. In this study, based on the Al–Si binary phase diagram, we revealed the formation path associated with the back surface field (BSF) of the Al–Si alloying process and elucidated the formation mechanism of voids for dashed shape local contact openings. Also, a calculation model is proposed to determine and verify the Si concentration at the peak temperature. During peak-temperature firing, an equilibrium is established between the dissolution and diffusion of Si; subsequently, Si in the melt reaches its saturation concentration and laterally diffuses into the Al layer, thereby causing the net outflow of Si with the contact trench expansion and forming partial voids. During cooling, supersaturated Si precipitates to form BSF, while the degree of precipitated Si limits the thickness and forms the hypereutectic alloy. After the BSF formation, the melt was redistributed along the contact trench, resulting in partial voids turning into complete voids and fully filled contacts. This study also provides a new approach for regulating and optimizing Al–Si contacts.

Abstract: As a significant component of silver paste, glass frit has a nonnegligible effect on crystalline silicon solar cells. The purpose of this research is to obtain an analysis method to explore the performance of glass frit for solar cells. The samples were measured by digital microscopic system, and the three-dimensional layered tinting model was established. Moreover, the longitudinal cutting was carried out. The data of cross section was analyzed to obtain the information of melt height, wetting base angle, and melting included angle, to further infer the relationship between thermal stability, fluidity, wettability with mathematical model of glass frit through theoretical derivation. The curve fitting method was introduced in detail and the law was summarized. Based on relationship of them, the melting characteristics of glass frit could be quantitatively tested. The vertical view and surface topography were measured by the digital microscope and found that the glass frit underwent shrinkage, softening, wetting, spreading, and equilibrium during sintering. Combined with the image, abundant information was detected from the macroscopic structure of glass surface. Meanwhile, the mechanism of spreading was explained. Finally, the screen-printing technology combined with the 3D microscopic view of the silver grid line proved that glass frit with satisfactory performance can effectively reduce the contact resistance of solar cells, improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency, verify the feasibility and accuracy of the simulation method equally. This study not only enriches the understanding of glass frit for crystalline silicon solar cells, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the research and determination of its performance.

Abstract: Thermochemical heat storage has been successfully employed as a reliable solution for enhancing the utilisation of renewable energy. In this paper, we report novel composite sorbents fabricated by impregnating CaCl2 into porous minerals with different structural properties. Sepiolite (SP), diatomite (DT), and expanded perlite (EP) were chosen as the mesoporous, macroporous, and foamed macroporous matrices, respectively. The pore structure of the matrix exerts a vital influence on the loading of salt hydrates and the performance of the composite material. EP/Ca had the highest energy storage density of 2166 J/g with a water exchange amount of 1.20 g/g, while the energy storage densities of SP/Ca and DT/Ca were 1026 J/g and 1520 J/g, respectively. The foamed macropores of EP provided more space for salt hydrate loading, whereas DT and SP only possessed mesoporous pores with limited pore volumes, thus contributing to lower salt hydrate content. Moreover, EP/Ca exhibited good structural stability during heat storage cycles because of the foamed macroporous structure. In contrast, the restrictive effect of the holes of DT on the salt solution was low, thus causing DT/Ca leakage and caking. Therefore, EP was chosen as the most suitable matrix for supporting salt hydrates. Moreover, this work presents an excellent perspective for exploring new sorption heat-storage materials with low cost, mass production, and high performance.

Abstract: It is of great significance for designing prospective composite phase change materials (PCMs) with high shape-stabilized property, good thermal conductivity and efficient energy storage and conversion capacity. This study successfully developed a novel composite PCMs that TaON nanoparticles doped polyethylene glycol/metal-organic frameworks (PEG/MOFs) using a convenient impregnation method. The inherent favorable thermal conductivity of HKUST-1 and the excellent visible light absorption ability of TaON endowed the composite PCMs with remarkably improved thermal conductivity (increased by 126.7% over pure PEG) and remarkable photo-thermal conversion ability (η: 89.9–94.6%). Furthermore, the composite PCMs exhibited not only high shape stability, high thermal energy storage capacity (148.1 J/g) but also outstanding thermal stability and reliability. Accordingly, this novel photothermal composite PCMs would be hopefully applied to efficient storage, management and utilization for solar energy.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cell derived-hepatocytes depict fetal -hepatocyte characteristics/maturity and are immunogenic limiting their applications. Attempts have been made to derive hepatocytes from mesenchymal stem cells using developmental cocktails, epigenetic modulators and small molecules. However, achieving a stable terminally differentiated functional state had been a challenge. Inefficient hepatic differentiation could be due to lineage restrictions set during development. Hence a novel lineage reprogramming approach has been utilized to confer competence to adipose-mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) to efficiently respond to hepatogenic cues and achieve a stable functional hepatic state. Lineage reprogramming involved co-transduction of ADMSCs with hepatic endoderm pioneer Transcription factor (TF)-FOXA2, HHEX-a homeobox gene and HNF4α-master TF indispensable for hepatic state maintenance. Lineage priming was evidenced by endogenous HFN4α promoter demethylation and robust responsiveness to minimal hepatic maturation cues. Induced hepatocytes (i-Heps) exhibited mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and terminal hepatic signatures. Functional characterisation of i-Heps for hepatic drug detoxification systems, xenobiotic uptake/clearance, metabolic status and hepatotropic virus entry validated acquisition of stable hepatic state and junctional maturity Exhaustive analysis of MSC memory in i-Heps indicated loss of MSC-immunophenotype and terminal differentiation to osteogenic/adipogenic lineages. Importantly, i-Heps suppressed phytohemagglutinin-induced T-cell blasts, inhibited allogenic mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and secreted immunomodulatory- indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in T-cell blast co-cultures akin to native ADMSCs. In a nutshell, the present study identifies a novel cocktail of TFs that reprogram ADMSCs to stable hepatic state. i-Heps exhibit adult hepatocyte functional maturity with robust immune-modulatory abilities rendering suitability for rigorous drug testing, hepatocyte-pathogen interaction studies and transplantation in allogenic settings.

Abstract: Considering the destructive effect of ice accumulation on material surfaces, substantial attention has been devoted to fabricating anti-icing superhydrophobic coatings. However, most superhydrophobic coatings cannot deice. Herein, a special nanofiller was designed and fabricated as the main component of a superhydrophobic coating for simultaneously improving its anti-icing and de-icing performance. Firstly, hydrangea-like ZnO@CuS (H–ZnO@CuS) was synthesized via a precipitation process at room temperature. Then, a superhydrophobic composite coating composed of epoxy resin (ER), H–ZnO@CuS, and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was fabricated on the Al surface via a layer-by-layer spraying process. The results demonstrate that, after 100 tape peeling tests and 40 abrasion cycles, the hydrophobicity of the ER/H–ZnO@CuS/PDMS composite coating remains basically unchanged, and its water contact angle (WCA) can still reach 156.3°, thus exhibiting excellent superhydrophobicity and mechanical durability. More importantly, the composite coating displays outstanding anti-icing and de-icing performance, which can prolong the static freezing time of water droplets from 3 to 13 min at −15 °C and prevent the formation of ice when water is dripped continuously for 20 min at −10 °C. Additionally, the melting time of ice at −15 °C can be shortened from 5 to 1 min due to the photothermal behavior of H–ZnO@CuS. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy to endow coatings with simultaneous anti-icing and de-icing performance. This approach can not only improve the current efficiency of de-icing/anti-icing processes but also reduce the energy consumption by effectively reducing or eliminating the accumulation of water on the structure surface before it freezes.

Abstract: Utilizing fins with horseshoe shape connected to bottom of tube and install of perforated tape at center of pipe, leading to higher level of productivity in current article. Furthermore, the mixing rate will hopefully be improved with dispersing hybrid nano-powders, because the thermal features of operate fluid will be intensified. The solar system includes twenty mirrors which concentrate the solar rays to the region of absorber pipe. The distribution of assimilating heat flux was derived via SolTrace and outputs showed that the bottom point absorbs the greatest rays, which is why the horseshoe fins were attached to bottom of pipe. Assessment of grid and accuracy of model have been presented and good accommodation with empirical data made it clear that such selected techniques in modeling were suitable for turbulent flow. The scrutinized variable parameters of current work are: Angle of horseshoe fins (θ = 0°, 30°, 45°); Pitch ratio (PR (=P/D) = 3.2, 4); Inlet flow rate (Q = 13, 19 Lit/min); Fraction of additives (φ = 0, 0.02). Not only the patterns of hybrid nanofluid in forms of contours but also substantial functions such as pumping power (W•) and thermal efficiency (ηth) were evaluated in outputs. Due to elevate of heat absorption with dispersing hybrid nano-powders, ηth will be enhanced about 0.01% when θ = 0°, Q = 19, PR = 3.2. When Q = 13, with augment of θ, convective coefficient reduces around 12.02% and pumping power declines around 37.61%. As PR declines, the mixing of hybrid nanofluid improves and convective factor elevates around 6.43% while such change makes pumping power to augment about 30.67%. As flow rate of fluid at inlet increases, the thermal performance and convective factor augment around 0.18% and 31.98% but with higher level of pumping power about 195.41%.

Abstract: Parasitic solar heating of the radiative cooler remarkably counteracts the cooling effect generated by radiative cooling. Many previous works have contributed to improving the solar reflectivity of the cooler to reduce its solar absorption, including using highly reflective film or optimized scattering effect. Herein, an easy and passive sunlight blocking strategy based on geometrical optics is applied to reduce the solar heating power of the cooler by using a ring-like shield to prevent the propagation of direct sunlight, corresponding to decoupling the cooler from solar beam irradiance. A black paint-coated cooler with strong solar absorption of over 0.9 and a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (P-PTFE) cooler with a high solar reflection of over 0.9 are fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of the sunlight blocking strategy. Results show that radiative cooling to 3.5°C and 6.5°C below ambient temperature under average solar irradiance of 500 W m−2 is achieved by the black paint and P-PTFE, revealing that the proposed sunlight blocking strategy contributes to efficient sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling. Theoretical analysis not only proves the effectiveness of the sunlight blocking strategy but also reveals that cooler with selective emission within the atmospheric window is more sensitive to sunlight, as well as capturing the radiative cooling performance under different conditions.

Abstract: As new technologies for high-performance PV modules are developed and applied, the cost of the PV modules is also increasing. To reduce the consumption of Ag paste used for the high-power shingled PV module, a new patterns of electrode design is needed. Accordingly, we focused on reducing the consumption of Ag paste used for the metallization of solar cells by designing busbar-free electrode patterns suitable for shingled photovoltaic modules. In this paper, we introduced the busbar-free design of the electrode patterns on the front and rear side of the crystalline silicon solar cells. Based on the conventional and the busbar free designs, the shingled string of each type of electrode pattern was manufactured and its characteristics were investigated. The efficiency of the busbar-free type of shingled string was almost the same as that of the string having the conventional pattern. The proposed electrode pattern did not affect the efficiency or output power of the shingled module, while the amount of Ag usage in the solar cells was reduced by more than 60%. As a result, we confirmed that the busbar free electrode pattern proposed in this study was suitable for a cost-effective shingled PV module.

Abstract: The corrosion behavior of pressureless-sintered SiC in a molten NaCl–KCl–MgCl2 salt at 700 °C was investigated. Results indicate that it is prior for SiC and sintering aid B around grain boundaries to be corroded. MgCl2⋅xH2O(x=4,6) in the salt plays an important role in the corrosion of SiC. MgCl2⋅xH2O is hydrolyzed to HCl, H2O, and MgO, which react with SiC and B to form C, SiO2, SiCl4, B2O3, and Mg2SiO4. The corrosion depth of SiC and the concentrations of elements Si and B in the salt increase with the corrosion time, which are fitted well with Fick's law of diffusion.

Abstract: MgSnN2 thin films were deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering on fused silica and silicon substrates. The properties of the films were determined as a function of the deposition temperature. Although the films exhibited a strong preferred orientation along the [002] direction, cumulative X-ray diffractograms at various χ angles evidenced that the deposited films crystallized in a wurtzite-like structure. Regardless of the substrate temperature during deposition, MgSnN2 films had a columnar microstructure. Mössbauer spectrometry and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy were used to extract the chemical environment of magnesium and tin atoms and to identify their oxidation states. Electrical properties were deduced from Hall effect measurements. An increase of the electron mobility was noticed at high deposition temperature.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices are mainly investigated for energy harvesting and saving applications. Electrochromic supercapacitors (ECSC) attract smart electronics device applications by integrating electrochromic materials into energy storage devices. WO3 has been predominantly investigated materials for this application. Amorphous, transparent WO3 thin films owing to diffusive charge storage kinetics with improved active sites promote the better intercalation of Li+ ions in the porous surface area, which yields electrochromic supercapacitive performance. In the present study, WO3 thin films were prepared by electrodeposition and studied for their physicochemical, electrochemical, and electrochromic properties. Electronic properties of WO3 thin films were measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in terms of density of states [D(Ef)] at the Fermi level. Charge storage kinetics of WO3 thin films studied by EIS corroborated with the voltammetry studies. The WO3 electrode exhibits wide optical modulation (∼90%) with the highest coloration efficiency (η) of 132.89 cm2/C, including higher areal capacitance of 39.81 mF/cm2 and volumetric capacitance of 180.91 mF/cm3 at 20 mV/s scan rate with the capacitance retention up to 83% after 1000 CV cycles.

Abstract: GaAs photovoltaic (PV) cells have been extensively studied for flexible energy harvesting devices due to their merits such as thin-film feasibility, flexibility, and high-efficiency. However, GaAs-based thin-film PV cells have a limitation for the applications in wearable platform since they are not compatible with fabric carrier. To handle this problem, we report thin-film transfer technique that involves a sacrificial layer with a double-layer structure, an Au–Au bonding technique, a Cr/Au bilayer to induce metal stress, and an etchant for fast epitaxial lift-off (ELO). In addition, a polyimide layer attached underneath the fabric substrate not only protects the fragile epi layer but also accelerates the lateral etching via spontaneous bending. The application of these techniques enables the successful transfer of GaAs thin-film PV epi structures onto fabric platform without degrading crystal quality. Fabric-based GaAs PV cells are fabricated via the standard PV cell fabrication process. The platform expansion of GaAs thin-film techniques has great potential for large-scale commercialization.

Abstract: This study focuses on the time dependent performance of the corrosion resistance of IN625, H230 and 740H alloys in the solar salt (60 wt% NaNO3, 40 wt% KNO3, at 600 °C) for up to 4000 h. Alloy IN625 showed the lowest mass change with parabolic oxidation kinetics that tends to stabilize with exposure time. Both 740H and H230 alloys deviated from the parabolic oxidation behavior beyond the 3000 h of exposure. Alloy 740H showed the highest mass loss due to the nonuniform surface oxidation and the high chromium dissolution rate. Internal oxidation was noticed with Alloy H230 due to the high tungsten concentrations.

Abstract: Objective
The culture failure rate of conventional karyotyping in products of conception evacuated from early pregnancy loss by traditional electrical vacuum aspiration and/or dilation & curettage remains high. We aim to determine whether obtaining products of conception from early pregnancy loss via another evacuation approach, ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration, could decrease the culture failure rate of karyotyping.
Methods
For patients with early pregnancy loss, ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration (Case group) and traditional electrical vacuum aspiration and/or dilation & curettage (Control group) were applied as surgical methods for pregnancy loss management respectively. The evacuated products of conception were subjected to cytogenetic karyotyping analysis. The primary outcome was the culture failure rate of karyotyping. Secondary outcomes included the chromosomal abnormality spectrum, maternal cell contamination, and complications from the manual vacuum aspiration procedure.
Results
For the case group, 132 products of conception were genetically analyzed by conventional karyotyping. The culture failure rate was significantly lower than that of the control cohort (2.3% vs 7.4%, p = 0.027). 65.2% of cases were abnormal within the detection scope of karyotyping. The euploid female to male ratio was 0.82 (18:22), suggesting a lower likelihood of maternal cell contamination. The efficacy in achieving complete evacuation was 99.6%. There were no significant complications from the procedure.
Conclusion
Ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration approach significantly decreased the culture failure rate of karyotyping and decreased maternal cell contamination tendency, enabling a high and accurate cytogenetic diagnosis. It is especially crucial when the cytogenetic analysis is required in the early pregnancy loss clinics.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling is an innovative way to radiate heat from objects to outer space by reflecting the sunlight and producing emission in the infrared spectrum especially in the atmospheric transparency window without additional energy input, which has received a widespread attention. However, state-of-the-art radiative coolers have a white appearance in the reflection of the total incoming solar radiation, facing inevitable challenges for anti-glare and other aesthetic issues. To address these problems, we have developed scalable colored coatings by using a facile solvothermal reaction. A combination of color and efficient radiative cooling has, thereby, been achieved by sacrificing a part of the reflections in the visible spectrum. The reflectance in the near-infrared spectrum, and emittance in the atmospheric window, were then maximized to 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Without the contribution of an additional reflective layer, this type of coating has been found to achieve a sub-ambient temperature drop of 2.31°C (under a solar irradiance of 885 Wm-2) and a net cooling power of 68 Wm-2. Due to the low cost of raw oxide materials, and simple preparation process, the present study has demonstrated a novel potential for large-scale practical applications of colored coatings for passive radiative cooling.

Abstract: A new configuration of V-trough solar concentrator is proposed, constructed and investigated in an attempt to improve the concentration ratio of the V-trough concentrators. The new design consists of two conventional V-trough concentrators arranged in a cross, which lead to improvement in concentration ratio and angular response. The results of an experimental study show that the concentration ratio of this new configuration (referred to as OVSC) is 40%–60% higher than its corresponding conventional V-trough solar concentrator (CVSC) with additional benefits. The study reveals that the angular response of this new configuration is better than conventional V-tough concentrator with a potential to reduce the cost of concentrators by using less reflector materials. Surprisingly, the improvement in the concentration ratio is not accompanied by significant reduction in optical efficiency and light uniformity, making it a better alternative for low-cost and low concentration applications in future.

Abstract: WO3 film possesses excellent electrochemical properties and have great potential for application in electrochromic devices. The a-WO3/c-WO3 dual phase laminated film was prepared by stacking amorphous film (a-WO3), made by a novel electrodeposition-assisted sol-gel method, on crystalline WO3 film (c-WO3) coated on ITO substrate. The effect of the crystal phase and electrodeposition time on the structure and the properties of a-WO3/c-WO3 dual phase laminated film was investigated. The dual phase laminated film exhibited excellent electrochromic performance due to the synergistic effect of a-WO3 and c-WO3, as well as the featured rougher surface of the dual phase laminated film. The thickness of a-WO3 film gradually increased with the extension of deposition time, and a-WO3/c-WO3 dual phase laminated film with appropriate thickness a-WO3 film possessed the fastest response time and the highest optical contrast. The optimized a-WO3/c-WO3 dual phase laminated film exhibited excellent electrochromic performance with high optical contrast (70.6% at 633 nm) and high coloring efficiency (53.6 cm2 C−1 at 633 nm). Under without ion storage layer, the electrochromic device (ECD) with laminated structure dual phase a-WO3/c-WO3 film as the electrochromic layer has been successfully assembled, which shows fascinating performance, providing a useful reference for the facile processing and application of electrochromic WO3 film in smart windows.

Abstract: Three-dimensional finite difference time domain simulations were performed to evaluate the absorption enhancement of near-band edge light in 500 nm-thick GaAs solar cells with textured rear reflectors. Three types of the textures were examined: Triangular-prisms, pyramids, and a pseudo-random etch. The tested design parameters were the period and aspect ratios of the texture and then the thickness of the transparent rear scattering layer. It was found that a low-index layer between semiconductor and metal was required to achieve a high degree of absorption enhancement, as this layer greatly reduced parasitic absorption in the metal reflector. In terms of absorption enhancement, pyramids of nearly any period and aspect ratio were superior to triangular prisms by a factor between 2 and 3. The pseudo-random etch achieved performance generally between the two other texture types. The most promising texture in terms of feasibility and performance was pyramids with a period of 2µm and aspect ratio of 0.3, as this texture is accessible to wet-etching and granted especially high absorption enhancement. A cell thusly textured achieved 1-sun terrestrial short-circuit current of 27.4 mA/cm2 compared to 28.3 mA/cm2 for a conventional, 3µm-thick on-substrate cell. Current loss was due to parasitic absorption and light escaping through the front surface.

Abstract: In the cochlea, various factors, such as noise, aging, and inflammation, induce hypoxia, resulting in the up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The role of HIF-1α in hypoxic marginal cells (MCs) of the stria vascularis is unknown. This study examined HIF-1α-mediated autophagy in MCs of neonatal rats and its mechanism of action. We found that an increase in HIF-1α expression was associated with autophagy and apoptosis. Treatment with PX478, a specific inhibitor of HIF-1α, decreased the HIF-1α level, and the degree of autophagy decreased in hypoxic and apoptotic MCs. By contrast, treatment with DMOG, an activator of HIF-1α, increased autophagy and decreased apoptosis. Both PX478 and DMOG had no effect on the apoptotic rate after treatment with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy, indicating that HIF-1α promoted autophagy to protect MCs from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Lastly, we silenced Bnip3(Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein) in MCs to identify the mechanism of action. Our results show that the HIF-1α–BNIP3 pathway mediates the anti-apoptotic effects through an increase in autophagy.

Abstract: Within this work, we evaluate and compare different high-end screens for the fine line front side metallization of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cells. Three types of high-end screens are considered including (i) a fine mesh screen configuration with a mesh count MC = 520 wires/inch and standard mesh angle of φ = 22.5°, (ii) a knotless screen configuration with a mesh angle of φ = 0° as well as (iii) a knotless screen configuration utilizing a rectangular mesh with different mesh count in warp and weft direction MC = 460/430 wires/inch. Using these advanced screen configurations, all PERC solar cells are metallized with a busbarless fine line front side grid at a nominal contact finger opening of 20 μm and 24 μm. All screen configurations obtained excellent results regarding finger geometry, silver laydown and electrical performance of the front side grid and the fabricated PERC solar cells. The most efficient group obtained a printed mean finger width of 21 μm with a silver laydown of only 19 mg and revealed a mean energy conversion efficiency of 22.7%. Furthermore, we investigate the geometric and electric results of the printed front side contacts in detail using advanced image analysis software and scanning electron microscopy and discuss the impact of the fine line front side metallization on the applicable cell interconnection concepts depending on the series resistance losses.

Abstract: Developing an absorber coating with high absorptance (α) in the solar spectrum region and low thermal emittance (ε) in the infrared region for concentrated solar power (CSP) applications, operating at temperatures >400 °C, is still a great challenge. Herein, we describe a multilayer solar selective coating on stainless steel 304 (SS 304) substrates with α of 0.954 and ε of 0.07. The multilayer solar selective coating consists of: (1) tungsten (W) infrared reflector layer, (2) titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) absorber layer, (3) titanium aluminum silicon nitride (TiAlSiN) absorber layer, (4) titanium aluminum silicon oxy-nitride (TiAlSiON) semi-absorber layer and (5) titanium aluminum silicon oxide (TiAlSiO) anti-reflection layer. The compositions of the individual layers have been selected in such a way that they easily form protective layers of Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 on the coating surface when exposed to high temperature in air. Further, addition of Si in different layers not only improves the thermal stability but also helps in densifying the microstructure of the layers. Moreover, the presence of multilayer structure hinders the formation of pinholes and pores along with columnar microstructure, a typical characteristic of the sputter deposited transition metal nitrides and oxides. This unique coating design, thus, leads to high spectral selectivity (α/ε) of 13.6 on SS 304 substrate along with thermal stability up to 600 °C for 1000 h in vacuum under cyclic heating conditions. These properties of the developed solar absorber coating demonstrate its suitability for evacuated receiver tubes in CSP plants.

Abstract: Optical and radiative properties of alumina–silica-based ceramic materials are determined in the spectral range of 3–10 μm as a function of temperature in the range of 150−650°C. The investigated materials are commercial CARBO HSP samples and in-house fabricated samples with sintering temperatures of 1400°C and 1500°C. Spectral normal emittance of the samples is measured in the spectral range of 3–20 μm using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A two-step inverse methodology consisting of analytical and numerical solutions to the radiative transfer equation is employed. The analytical solution is based on the modified two-flux approximation and the transport approximation, and is used to determine the transport scattering albedo. The iterative Monte Carlo ray-tracing method is used to obtain the transport extinction coefficient. The spectral normal emittance increases non-monotonically with the thermal treatment temperature of the samples due to the sintering extent increasing with the temperature during the preparation process. The spectral normal emittance of all investigated samples also increases non-monotonically with the increasing actual sample temperature. The maximum difference in total normal emittance at studied temperatures is 7.9%, 22% and 5.5% for the commercial sample and the in-house prepared samples sintered at 1400°C and 1500°C, respectively. With the sample temperature varying in the range of 150–650°C, the spectral normal emittance in the spectral range of 4–20 μm maximally varies by 23.2%, 44.3% and 23.4% for the commercial sample, and in-house prepared samples sintered at 1400°C and 1500°C, respectively. The transport scattering albedo decreases with increasing temperature for all samples in the considered spectral range. For all samples, the absorptive index increases non-monotonically with the increasing sample temperature. The most significant increase in the absorptive index, as the sample temperature increases, is found in the spectral range of 3–5 μm for the commercial material, and it increases by up to 31.6%, 116%, 170%, 186% and 194% when the temperature increases from 150°C to 250°C, 350°C, 450°C, 550°C and 650°C, respectively.

Abstract: Incoming radiation energy illuminating a solar cell contains a certain amount of entropy, which does not contribute to output electrical work. Entropy has a different spectral distribution from the internal energy of light and consequently affects PV cell performance. Here in this work, we investigate the influence of entropy content of thermally radiated light on the maximum achievable efficiency of single-junction solar cells. We revise the value of the well-known Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit for various absorber materials and take a deeper look at this effect by re-calculating the efficiency limit of crystalline silicon solar cells considering Meitner-Auger recombination. When considering the entropy content of AM 1.5 standard spectrum, the SQ limit for silicon drops from 33.15% to 30.42%. Further, considering Meitner-Auger recombination and using measured properties of silicon, the efficiency limit lowers to 27.12% from the already established 29.43%. This suggests a 4% thinner silicon absorber, reaching a thickness of ∼101 μm; hinting PV industry that a thinner Si wafer can provide the optimum outdoor energy yield. We further show that the entropy content of terrestrial radiation is less in favor of c-Si technology and most in favor of amorphous silicon. In the end, we discuss a few applications of considering entropy of incoming sunlight for photovoltaics, which range from PV device design to PV module tilt optimization and even PV system electrical standards.

Abstract: Compatible with crystalline silicon industry standards, thermal evaporation of perovskite cells on fully textured wafers with noticeable light trapping has been established. Then perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells prepared by this method presented potentially high photocurrent, but their open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) were moderate. Here, electrical losses of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells were reduced through combining the theoretical model of tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) with the growth mechanism of nanocrystalline silicon films. Their Voc loss was compensated 38 mV (from 1.767 V to 1.805 V), and FF was increased from 64.29% to 74.15% via adjusting the transport and recombination of carriers in TRJ. The fully textured tandem solar cell exhibited an efficiency of 26.91%, which provided an approach towards tandem devices with more than 30% efficiency.

Abstract: Background
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of chronic haematological disorders. At the molecular level of MPN cells, the gain-of-function mutation V617F of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) leads to a constitutive activation of the downstream signaling cascade and is a conventional criteria for diagnosis. Here, the functional role of the tumor suppressor SHIP1 (SH2 domain containing inositol-5 phosphatase 1) in the pathogenesis of MPNs was investigated.
Methods
Primary blood samples of MPN-patients were analysed using Western Blot technique regarding the level of SHIP1 expression. Moreover, SHIP1 and SHIP1-mutations were lentivirally transduced in the JAK2-V617F-positive UKE-1 cell line and expression was monitored over time. In addition, we examined SHIP1 reconstitution by inhibition of JAK2-V617F. Furthermore, we transfected SHIP1-expressing cells with a JAK2-V617F respectively a BCR-ABL construct and investigated changes in SHIP1 expression.
Results
Four out of five MPN-patient samples showed a loss or a reduction in SHIP1 expression. We identified JAK2 as a negative regulator of SHIP1 expression in MPN cells and inhibition of JAK2-V617F implicates a reconstituted SHIP1 expression. This is significant because SHIP1 negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway and in consequence the reconstitution of SHIP1 expression leads to a decreased cell growth. Moreover, we examined the impact of SHIP1 and patient-derived SHIP1-mutations on AKT phosphorylation and show the benefit of a combined therapy in MPN cells with inhibitors of the AKT/mTOR pathway.
Conclusion
In summary, the data suggest that SHIP1 may play a role during the development of MPNs and could be the basis for establishing a targeted therapy.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCM) have limited practical application due to their high rigidity, poor photothermal conversion, low thermal conductivity, and insufficient drive capability. In this work, a flexible CF/(HO-BNNS@CuO)/PEG composite with high thermal conductivity and photothermal conversion capacity was prepared by using carbon foam (CF) as flexible supporting material, hydroxyl boron nitride nanosheets (HO-BNNS) as thermal conductivity filler, and copper oxide (CuO) as photothermal conversion agent. In CF/(HO-BNNS@CuO)/PEG containing 90 wt% PEG, the photothermal conversion storage efficiency reached 91.8% and the thermal conductivity was improved by 348% compared to pure PEG. It also presents excellent thermally driven shape memory properties (98 s) with the elastic characteristics of CF and the phase change characteristics of PEG. This provides a strategy to prepare flexible PCM with outstanding comprehensive performance, which helps to broaden the practical application of PCM.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells are amongst the best performing thin-film technologies, with the latest performance gains being mainly due to recent years improvements obtained with post-deposition treatments (PDT). Moreover, thinning of the absorber layer down to sub-micrometre values (ultrathin absorbers) is of extreme importance for CIGS to be even more cost-effective and sustainable. However, electrical and optical limitations, such as rear interface recombination and insufficient light absorption, prevent the widespread implementation of ultrathin CIGS devices. The recent electrical CIGS simulation baseline models have failed to keep up with the experimental developments. Here an updated and experimentally based baseline model for electrical simulations in the Solar Cell Capacitor Simulator (SCAPS) software is presented and discussed with the incorporation of the PDT effects and increased optical accuracy with the support from Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation results. Furthermore, a champion solar cell with an equivalent architecture validates the developed thin-film model. The baseline model is also applied to ultrathin CIGS solar cell devices, validated with the ultrathin champion cell. Ultimately, these ultrathin models pave the way for an ultrathin baseline model. Simulations results reveal that addressing these absorbers' inherent limitations makes it possible to achieve an ultrathin solar cell with at least 21.0% power conversion efficiency, with open-circuit voltage values even higher than the recent thin-film champion cells.

Abstract: The current work proposes the combination of thermal storage and solar concentrating systems. To improve the low conduction mode of pure paraffin, not only the new style of fins but also dispersing ZnO nano-powders were suggested. The numerical procedure has been verified with the reported outputs in previous literature and good accommodation has been demonstrated. The utilized technique for modeling transient charging phenomena is enthalpy-porosity in which homogeneous model for prediction of paraffin properties were proposed. To determine the efficacy of angle of star-spline fins, simulations for all three proposed configurations have been done and outputs have been summarized in contours and plots. In existence of sunlight, the reflector makes the sun rays to concentrate along absorber tube and temperature of testing fluid augments. Such hot fluid flows within the inner pipe of double pipe system which contains paraffin in annulus region. With change of θ from 30° to 45° and 60°, the melting period saved to 13.14% and 18.61%, respectively. Adding ZnO nanoparticles help to augment the conduction mode and melting period declines around 4.79%. The lowest needed time for melting is about 4.88 h which is associated to case with φ = 0.035 and θ = 60°.

Abstract: All-perovskite tandem solar cells pave the way for increasing the efficiency of solar cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit imposed on single junction perovskite cells. While all-perovskite tandem solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.8% have been fabricated, the understanding of the underlying device physics during their operation still remains unclear. In this work we present an optoelectronic model for monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cell. This coupled model incorporating transfer matrix model for optical effects, and drift diffusion model for electrical effects accurately describes the photophysical and optoelectronic processes occurring in the all-perovskite tandem cell. The results of this model have been verified with results from a recent published experimental work on all-perovskite tandem cell with 24% PCE and show good agreement. The key parameters governing the PCE of tandem solar cells, such as trap density in active layer, recombination layer resistance, carrier mobility and absorber layer thicknesses are evaluated to establish design rules to attain greater than 30% PCE for all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Even though this model has been developed for an all-perovskite tandem solar cell, the principle guiding the model is general and can be applied to any type of tandem photovoltaic technology.

Abstract: Dual-band electrochromic smart windows can dynamically and independently control near infrared (NIR) and visible (Vis) light, and are considered a promising technology for improving building energy efficiency. However, most existing dual band electrochromic materials consist of complex nanocomposites, and it is difficult to balance the delicate composition of each constituent. Recently, to solve these problems, research has been conducted on single component dual-band electrochromic materials, in particular, oxygen deficient tungsten oxide (WO3-x) nanostructures. In this study, WO3-x nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple solvothermal method, and highly dispersible inks were formulated which could be deposited at relatively low temperature via various solution-based coating methods. Various analysis techniques including XRD, HR-TEM and in-situ spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed that the oxygen-deficient WO3-x composition remained intact up to an annealing temperature of 350 °C. Under suitable thermal treatment conditions, the resulting WO3-x films could independently and dynamically control NIR and VIS light transmittance. When a moderate voltage of −0.4 V was applied, the NIR light was mainly blocked via a capacitive charge mechanism, with optical modulations of 23.81% and 72.48% at 550 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. A further increase in applied voltage to −1.2 V led to the blocking of both VIS and NIR light through faradaic Li+ ion insertion with optical modulations of 71.13% and 84.57% at 550 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. Moreover, the optical modulations were maintained for 1000 consecutive cycles. This work demonstrates a single component dual-band electrochromic material that can be useful for various applications such as electrochromic smart windows.

Abstract: Limited treatment options and research in understanding the pathomechanisms of rare diseases has raised concerns about their therapeutic development. One such poorly understood ultra-rare neuromuscular disorder is GNE Myopathy (GNEM) which is caused due to mutation in key sialic acid biosynthetic enzyme, GNE. Treatment with sialic acid or its derivatives/precursors slows the disease progression, but curative strategies need to be explored further. Pathologically, muscle biopsy samples of GNEM patients reveal rimmed vacuole formation due to aggregation of β-amyloid, Tau, presenilin proteins with unknown mechanism. The present study aims to understand the mechanism of protein aggregate formation in GNE mutant cells to decipher role of chaperones in disease phenotype. The pathologically relevant GNE mutations expressed as recombinant proteins in HEK cells was used as a model system for GNEM to estimate extent of protein aggregation. We identified HSP70, a chaperone, as binding partner of GNE. Downregulation of HSP70 with altered BAG3, JNK, BAX expression levels was observed in GNE mutant cells. The cell apoptosis was observed in GNE mutation specific manner. An activator of HSP70 chaperone, BGP-15, rescued the phenotypic defects due to GNE mutation, thereby, reducing protein aggregation significantly. The results were further validated in rat skeletal muscle cell lines carrying single Gne allele. Our study suggests that HSP70 activators can be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of ultra-rare GNE Myopathy disease.

Abstract: Phase change materials with stable shape and superb thermal properties play a significant role in efficient utilization of solar energy. Herein, a novel industrial waste-based shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) with a high paraffin load (61.32%) and environment-friendly was designed and prepared via a vacuum impregnation method, in which calcium carbide furnace dust (CCFD) was selected as the supporting materials for the first time. The acidified CCFD (HCCFD) and activated HCCFD (ACCFD) were obtained by hydrochloric acid pickling and potassium hydroxide activation, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that calcium carbide furnace dust contains a certain amount of hollow spherical particles, which provided a well-maintained skeleton for the phase change medium. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicated that the Paraffin/ACCFD with 57.0% effective impregnation of paraffin. Besides, the maximum melting and freezing latent heats were around 106.31 J/g and 104.53 J/g, respectively. Moreover, the obtained SSPCM exhibited excellent chemical compatibility and thermochemical stability. It is worth noting that the Paraffin/ACCFD showed optimal thermal management ability. The current work suggested that the SSPCM prepared from calcium carbide furnace dust industrial waste has expansive application potentials in thermal energy storage and solar energy conversion.

Abstract: We develop an easily implementable yet effective process to achieve high power conversion efficiency in newly-developed flexible single-crystal-like GaAs thin-film photovoltaic solar cells on cheap metal tape. We study various techniques on the fabricated devices to passivate the defect states associated with dangling bonds at low-angle grain boundaries (LA-GBs) existing in the single-crystal-like GaAs material. We report that sulfur by trioctylphosphine sulfide (TOP:S) solution treatment can partially but effectively passivate the defect states at the LA-GBs to increase all the solar cell performance parameters of open-circuit voltage VOC (33.2%), short-circuit current JSC (19.5%), and fill factor FF (25.8%), resulting in the improvement of the power conversion efficiency more than double. The material and device characterizations and numerical modeling are performed to propose a mechanism, also suggesting that the power conversion efficiency higher than 20%, which is an important target milestone in emerging solar cell technologies, can be achieved. This work presents the first effective passivation of the bulk defects in GaAs at the device level and can also offer a solution for other photonic and electronic devices using non-single-crystalline GaAs films for flexible electronics.

Abstract: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a heterogeneous disease with skin fibrosis. Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is associated with fibrotic response. This work attempted to determine the precise mechanism of YAP/TAZ in SSc. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyse the differential gene expression between SSc patients and healthy volunteers, showing that the YAP/TAZ signalling pathway was enriched in the fibroblasts of SSc patients. Subsequently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to examine the levels of YAP and TAZ in mild and severe SSc patients. YAP and TAZ were highly expressed in the serum and skin tissues of mild and severe SSc patients, especially severe SSc patients. Additionally, an SSc mouse model was induced by bleomycin, and the impacts of YAP/TAZ knockdown on the pathological changes in skin and lung tissues were detected by haematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining. Knockdown of YAP and TAZ inhibited α-SMA mRNA and protein expression in skin and lung tissues of SSc mice. Inhibition of YAP and TAZ reduced skin inflammation and thickness and repressed lung inflammation and fibrosis in SSc mice. Importantly, knockdown of YAP and TAZ synergistically inhibited inflammation and fibrosis in skin and lung tissues in SSc mice. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that knockdown of YAP and TAZ exerted a synergistic effect on alleviating SSc in mice. Thus, this work suggests that YAP/TAZ is a potential target for SSc treatment.

Abstract: To meet the demand of miniaturized distributed solar energy supply and overcome the problem of solar discontinuity, this study innovatively combines mid-temperature molten salt energy storage system with solar thermal photovoltaic system and proposes a novel concept of molten salt energy storage-solar thermophotovoltaic integrated system. Based on the mid-temperature characteristics of the molten salt energy storage system, a tunable metamaterial structure is designed. By adjusting the geometric parameters of the structure, a near perfect absorber and a selective emitter are obtained to realize the spectrum reshaping for the integrated system. The average solar radiation absorbance of the absorber reaches 0.9556 and the selective emitter can help realize a TPV efficiency of 29.37%. The reliability and the radiation regulation mechanism of the structure is analyzed combining effective impedance and partial absorbance contribution analysis. On this basis, the performance of the integrated system is evaluated and the influence of operating temperature, concentration coefficient and PV cell type are explored. With the spectrum reshaping effect of the metamaterial structure, a high system efficiency of 27.90% can be obtained.

Abstract: Loss of muscle mass can lead to diseases such as sarcopenia, diabetes, and obesity, which can worsen the quality of life and increase the incidence of disease. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying skeletal muscle differentiation is vital to prevent muscle diseases. We previously found that microRNA-320 (miR-320) is highly expressed in the lean muscle-type pigs, but its regulatory role in myogenesis remains unclear. The bioinformatics prediction indicated that miR-320 could bind to the 3 'untranslated region of growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2). We hypothesized that miR-320 targets Grb2 to regulate myoblasts differentiation. To verify this, we transfected miR-320 mimic and inhibitor into C2C12 myoblasts to assess the role of miR-320 during myoblasts differentiation. We used real-time qPCR, luciferase reporter assays, and western blotting to confirm that miR-320 directly targets Grb2 to promote myoblasts differentiation. Moreover, by using a dexamethasone-induced atrophic model of myotubes, we discovered that miR-320 promotes the repair of damaged myotubes. Our findings expand understanding of miRNAs and genes related to regulating skeletal muscle differentiation, and provide insight into underlying therapeutic strategies for muscle diseases.

Abstract: Over recent years, renewable energy technologies have focused on increasing performance and efficiency, and on the reduction of maintenance costs. In this work, thermal-sprayed Inconel 625 coatings have been studied as an alternative for concentrated solar power plants receivers. A low-power compact plasma spray system was used to deposit coatings onto two substrates: grade 22 ferritic steel and AISI 316 L austenitic steel. This system may be used for in-situ maintenance or repair purposes. The coatings were heat-treated at two temperatures: 520 °C and 800 °C, at different exposure times. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of this treatment on the adherence and solar absorptivity of the Inconel 625 coatings. The results showed that, at higher temperatures and longer exposure times, better adherence and absorptivity are achieved. Adherence values above 60 MPa were obtained due to diffusion in the coating-substrate interface. Additionally, absorptivity values above 93% were measured due to oxide formation on the coating surface during heat treatment. Furthermore, the highest temperature of the oxidized treatment reported the highest values of absorptivity. These results show that the developed Inconel 625 coatings could be considered as a possible alternative to improve the performance of concentrated solar power plants.

F-box protein FBXO41 suppresses breast cancer growth by inducing autophagic cell death through facilitating proteasomal degradation of oncogene SKP2,

Abstract: F-box proteins form SCF (Cullin1, SKP1 and F-box-protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes to ubiquitinate cellular proteins. They play key role in several biological processes, including cell cycle progression, cellular signaling, stress response and cell death pathways. Therefore, deregulation of F-box proteins is closely associated with cancer progression. However, the role of most of the F-box proteins, including FBXO41, in cancer progression remains elusive. Here, we unravel the role of FBXO41 in cancer progression. We show that FBXO41 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by inducing autophagic cell death through an alternative pathway. Results revealed that FBXO41-mediated autophagic cell death induction is dependent on accumulation of cell cycle checkpoint protein p21. We found that FBXO41 increases the expression levels of p21 at the post-translational level by promoting the proteasomal degradation of SKP2, an oncogenic F-box protein. Mechanistically, FBXO41 along with p21 disrupts the inhibitory BCL2 (anti-apoptotic protein)-Beclin1 (autophagy initiating factor) complex of autophagy induction to release Beclin1, thereby inducing autophagy. Overall, the present study establishes a new FBXO41-SKP2-p21 axis for induction of autophagic cell death to prevent cancer growth, which could be explored to develop promising cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Interfacial solar steam generation is emerging as a promising high-efficiency strategy to produce clean water by harvesting and converting clean solar energy into localized heat. Here, we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to improve the photothermal performance by combining porous Ni mesh and carbon nanotube (CNTs) to construct an all-in-one Ni/CNTs solar absorber. In this work, due to the multiple reflections of incident light inside Ni/CNTs and the electronic transitions in the molecule, the Ni/CNTs solar absorber can efficiently utilize solar energy (94.3%) with an excellent evaporation rate of 2.13 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun illumination. The interfacial solar evaporator based on the Ni/CNTs solar absorber effectively removed heavy metal ions and dye molecules from contaminated water and displayed stable rate (1.96 kg m−2 h−1) for 46 h of cyclic evaporation, showing its great potential for practical seawater desalination.

Abstract: Photovoltaic modules consisting of one back-contact cell were manufactured by vacuum resin infusion process using glass reinforced epoxy composite as encapsulant where the cells are embedded. Incorporation of three coatings onto the composite surface was studied with the aim to improve the electrical performance stability of the modules under ultraviolet (UV), thermal cycling and damp-heat environmental weathering. Photovoltaic and aging performance were examined through the short-circuit current density values and colour change of the composite. Decrease in the initial photovoltaic performance of the modules was caused by the coating deposition. The highest drop in the initial values was observed for the varnish type coating, showing a decrease of 2.6% in short-circuit current. Regarding the performance stability, the decrease was more pronounced in the damp-heat test, presenting the varnish type coating the minimum loss of 1.4% in short-circuit current and a variation of 87% in b* chromatic parameter after 1000 h exposure at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity. The study concluded that the protective coating should be selected to provide the composite modules with an optimal trade-off between the initial electrical performance and the desired stability, with further research work targeted to improve moisture barrier properties.

Abstract: Three Cr2O3/Cr based multilayer coatings were designed, optimised, and sputter-deposited. The selective solar absorbers presented in this study were specifically considered for evacuated flat plate solar collectors (EFPCs) at working temperatures of 100, 200, and 300 °C. The film matrix method and genetic optimisation algorithm were used to simulate and optimise the coatings. Further, the robustness of the performance of the coatings related to the unpreventable errors in layer thickness during the manufacturing stage was incorporated as a binding parameter of the genetic algorithm. This solution allowed the optimisation to converge to the thickness package with the highest performance, thereby ensuring proper robustness for given errors in layer thickness. Thereafter, the robustness of the optimised coatings was analysed, consequently confirming an efficiency loss of less than 2% for layer thickness variation of up to ±20% from the optimal thickness value. The obtained values of solar absorptance as high as 0.97, and thermal emittance lower than 0.05 up to 300 °C, validated through measurements on the fabricated samples, are expected to provide unparalleled performances for the emerging technology of EFPCs.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices for effective infrared (IR) modulation are receiving increasing attention in engineering. However, the majority of the devices for IR modulations possess planar sandwich structures, restricting their implantation into fabrics and limiting their comfortable wearability due to the bad air permeability. Herein, a fiber-shaped dynamic thermal radiation-regulated device with a novel integrative core-shell structure, based on carbon fiber and polyaniline has been developed. The device with high performance can realize dynamic thermal radiation regulation with the IR emissivity (△ε) as high as 0.4 at 7.5–14 μm. Furthermore, the device can reversibly change color between dark green (in the oxidized state) and golden yellow (in the reduced state) as a response to low applied potentials (−0.5 V and 0.6 V) with fast response time (1.7 s). In addition, the device demonstrates high cycling stability as evident from the current-time (i-t) curve of the reduced and oxidized states as well as stable Δε after 500 cycles. The performances, including △ε and cyclic voltammetry curve (CV) of the device demonstrate no apparent degradation after 500 bending cycles, indicating high durability. This study provides new insights into fiber-shaped dynamic thermal radiation-regulated devices and highlights their applications in personal thermal management, adaptive thermal camouflage, and intelligent wearable devices.

Abstract: Ozone-gas oxidation (OGO) technology, capable of integrating into tube plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technology, is developed to prepare the Nano SiOx layer for tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells in this work. The effects of gas flow, oxidation temperature, and annealing temperature on passivation quality are investigated. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that OGO SiOx possesses a Si4+ proportion of about 20%, higher than the nitric acid oxidized (NAOS) SiOx and plasma-assisted N2O oxidation (PANO) SiOx. The implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of the hydrogenated lifetime sample is promoted to more than 740 mV with the highest value of 748 mV, corresponding to a lowest single-sided saturation current density (J0,s) of 3.1 fA/cm2. The contact resistivity extracted from the Cox-Strack method is < 9 mΩ cm2 as the annealing temperature is more than 840 °C. Finally, we prepared the large-sized TOPCon solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.37% and a maximum efficiency of 24.41%, respectively. The above work shows that the tube PECVD technology integrated with ozone gas oxidation has the potential for the mass-production TOPCon industry.

Abstract: Solar selective absorber coatings with wide angular solar absorptance aids in attaining high photo-thermal conversion efficiency for solar thermal systems. In this regard, nanoparticles-based absorber coatings were developed on stainless steel grade 304 by combining the impregnation method, solvothermal process, and dip-coating technique. Developed nanocomposite (SiO2 nanoparticles in transition metal oxide matrix) based single layer absorber coating with nano void textured surface, exhibits solar absorptance of 0.92 and spectral emittance of 0.12. MgF2 nanoparticles based anti-reflective layer on single-layer absorber coating improves the solar absorptance to 0.94 by destructive interference mechanism. Both nanoparticles based single and tandem absorber coatings show wide angular solar absorptance of 0.88 and 0.89, respectively, at an incidence angle of 50°. Besides, developed absorber coatings show lower thermal emissivity of 0.17 and good photo-thermal conversion efficiencies at high operating temperatures (400–500 °C). These developed absorber coatings offer excellent thermal stability at an open atmospheric condition till operating temperature, such as 400 °C for 100 h. Selective nature with wide angular solar absorptance and low heat loss behaviour of stable absorber coating show the photo-thermal conversion efficiency of 91% can improve the performance of receiver tubes in solar thermal systems.

Abstract: In order to solve the leakage problem of commonly used polyethylene glycol (PEG) phase change material (PCM), PEG reacted with 4′ 4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) to prepare the polyurethane-based solid-solid phase change material (PU-SSPCM) by the two-step solvent method, and the influence of organic montmorillonite (OMMT) on the phase transition property and crystallization capacity of PU-SSPCM was first studied. The solid-solid phase change polyurethane materials were successfully prepared when the molar ratio of PEG to MDI was 0.75, and the organic montmorillonite acted as a crosslinking heterogeneous nucleating agent to improve the temperature control capacity, the crystallization ability and the thermal stability of the solid-solid phase change polyurethane material. When the addition of OMMT was 0.5 wt%, the phase change enthalpy of PU-SSPCM increased to 106.8J/g from 95.46J/g, a constant temperature platform appeared for about 300 s during both the heating and cooling process, thus demonstrating excellent temperature control ability. The relative crystallinity increased to 74.8% from 66.5% and the initial thermal weight loss temperature was increased from 348 °C to 368 °C.

Abstract: Improper disposal of waste solar panels can raise serious concerns about the environment and human health. Therefore, it is important to recycle the waste panels to ensure that the modules do not pollute the environment. Different techniques developed globally for the recycling of waste photovoltaic modules include organic solvent dissolution, electro-thermal heating, and thermal treatment. The present study is focused particularly on the optimization of the parameters to identify i) an efficient solvent for the dissolution of the encapsulant, ii) position of the module for improved dissolution, iii) the effect of temperature variation on solubility, and iv) saturation studies of EVA. It is concluded that Trichloroethylene at 70 °C works effectively for the separation of different components with the ratio of 1:7.44 of the module to solvent in a horizontal position. The maximum percentage of a module in the solvent is 13.44% and an increase in this percentage will result in an ineffective separation. A novelty approach has been reported for the first time to experimentally determine the quantity of solvent, position of the module, and the lowest temperature required for encapsulant dissolution.

Abstract: Renal collecting duct principal cells play a key role in controlling body water balance. Principal cells express the water channels AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4 that mediate renal water reabsorption. AQP3 and AQP4 are expressed at the basolateral membrane constitutively. Conversely, AQP2 is localized in intracellular vesicles and translocates to the plasma membrane under vasopressin action. Stimulation with vasopressin activates the cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway that induces the redistribution of AQP2 from an intracellular pool to the apical plasma membrane. AQP2 trafficking and function depend on multiple post-translational modifications. Moreover, several proteins control different steps activated by the vasopressin stimulation that triggers the redistribution of the AQP2 vesicles. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) together with phosphodiesterases and adenylate cyclases play crucial roles in modulating local changes of cAMP. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE), cytoskeletal proteins, and the small GTPases of the Rho family regulate the fusion and the endocytotic retrieval of AQP2 vesicles. Abnormal vasopressin signaling and altered AQP2 expression or trafficking can lead to disorders characterized by deregulated mechanisms controlling water homeostasis. This review provides updated data on the molecular signals regulating vasopressin-induced AQP2 trafficking in health and disease.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an exciting thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology due to their high efficiency and applicability for low-cost roll-to-roll fabrication. The progression of this technology towards commercialization requires a concerted effort to understand and address the degradation mechanisms currently hindering the longevity of PSCs. Cell instability in the presence of ambient moisture and oxygen is a dominating factor undermining their operational lifetime and thus the development of encapsulation materials and processes is central to addressing this instability. Herein, we report the results of a study on the effect of flexible encapsulant pre-conditioning (drying) on the durability of five PSC types with varying perovskite composition and device architecture. Performance testing over 1500 h revealed that two of the three conventionally structured (n-i-p) PSC devices were stable irrespective of moisture-content level in the barrier materials, whereas both inverted (p-i-n) device types suffered significant degradation when encapsulated with barrier materials without pre-conditioning. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurements and spectroscopic impedance analysis of the encapsulated devices demonstrated the extent to which out-gassing can impact the interfacial electrical properties of the PSCs. This study reveals the critical importance of appropriate conditioning treatments of flexible encapsulant materials prior to encapsulation for achieving optimal long-term stability of PSCs.

Abstract: The long-term reliability of encapsulation has a critical impact on the overall cost and effectiveness of photovoltaic modules. An often overlooked but important element of this reliability concerns adhesive degradation of the encapsulant, which results in delamination. This work critically examines the degradation mechanisms – deacetylation, β-scission, and hydrolytic depolymerization – primarily responsible for adhesion loss in ethylene co-vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants to provide evidence and clarity regarding the contribution of these mechanisms to the adhesive degradation over the lifetime of a module. EVA samples obtained from mini-modules exposed in two sets of controlled, accelerated conditions – with and without ultraviolet (UV) radiation – are characterized to find specific evidence for the proposed degradation mechanisms. The mini-modules were exposed up to 10,000 h, which represents up to 15–20 years in the field. Results affirm that initially, deacetylation dominates the degradation before scission takes over, followed by hydrolytic depolymerization. Additional analysis highlights the climacteric interdependency between deacetylation and hydrolytic depolymerization as it relates to eventual delamination, where deacetylation products catalyze interfacial hydrolysis reactions. Furthermore, effects occurring at a given interface are isolated, explicitly providing evidence for how these mechanisms are nonuniform throughout the thickness of the EVA. Results demonstrate that the EVA that interfaces with the glass as opposed to the cell experiences increased levels of degradation, explaining why this initially stronger interface becomes the preferential interface for delamination after longer periods of exposure. Additionally, elevated temperatures alone are shown to induce limited migration of sodium ions across the glass/EVA interface.

Abstract: Herein, we have developed an H-bonded network polymer architecture with improved crystallinity and photophysical properties through a supramolecular interaction between carboxylic acid-containing perylenebisimide (PBI) cross-linker and poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (P4VP) polymer chains. The H-bonded supramolecular polymers (SMPs) are thoroughly characterized using 1H NMR, FTIR, XRD, and AFM studies. The XRD reveals higher molecular packing, long-range ordering, and better crystallinity after supramolecular assembly formation, while AFM confirms the fibril and sphere-like nanostructures in the SMP networks with decreased diameters. The long-range ordering and nanoaggregate structures in SMP benefit the network structure for better diffusion of counter ions during the redox reaction of the PBI moieties. The electrochromic (EC) measurements of the films divulge the similar reversible EC colour change of the PBI and SMP films from pristine red to deep violet along with vis-to-NIR electrochromism between the −2 V to +1 V potential sweeping along with the significant improvement of the EC parameters in SMP films compared to pristine PBI film. The colouring time (red to deep violet) is improved by 63% (5.6 s–2.2 s), while the bleaching time (deep violet to red) is speeded up by 51% (8.4 s–4.1 s) along with the increment in colouration efficiency by 50% (52.3 cm2/C to 78.1 cm2/C). Therefore, this report is very advantageous to deliver a simple and viable strategy for the enhancement of the EC parameters of organic electrochromes through the generation of ordered H-bonded polymer network formation.

Abstract: This study describes a comprehensive analysis of light trapping and photon recycling (PR) in thin-film GaAs solar cells, explicitly considering the effects of (non-perfect) light scattering at a textured rear mirror. We calculate the probabilities of escape, reabsorption in the absorber and parasitic absorption for internally generated photons, as well as the reflectance, absorptance and parasitic absorptance of externally incident photons. Combined with the internal luminescent efficiency to account for non-radiative recombination non-explicitly, but in a phenomenological manner, device performance metrics such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and its radiative limit, the external luminescent efficiency, the contribution of PR to the Voc and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are derived. We analyze a typical thin-film GaAs solar cell architecture, consisting of an n-GaAs/p-InGaP heterojunction structure cladded by commonly employed front- and rear-side layer stacks. The probabilities of escape, reabsorption and parasitic absorption and the resulting performance metrics are presented as a function of absorber thickness, rear-mirror reflectivity, haze factor, internal luminescent efficiency, front grid coverage and band tailing. The simulations show that the implementation of a textured rear mirror reduces PR and its importance for device performance. In these textured cells, a high rear-mirror reflectivity and, thereby, efficient PR, is less crucial to achieve Voc values close to the radiative limit. The increased Jsc in textured cells renders light trapping favorable for the PCE, regardless of absorber thickness and material quality and despite reduced PR. Furthermore, the impact of an absorbing front grid and lateral transport of internal luminescence on PR is estimated, emphasizing the importance of transparent (non-absorbing) contact layers, at the rear, but importantly, also at the front of the device. To conclude, PCE limits of 300-nm-thick GaAs solar cells are deduced in the context of an experimentally realized light-trapping scheme based on a randomly textured rear mirror. PCEs exceeding 25.5% are deemed realistic.

Abstract: The interfacial contact quality between the hydrophilic MAPbI3 and hydrophobic PCBM thin films are improved by using the treatment of a saturated bathocuproine/isopropanol (BCP/IPA) solution, which largely increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 12.96% to 18.67%. The atomic force microscopic images, water-droplet contact angle images, viscosity measurement results and near-infrared transmittance spectra show that the increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) is related to the formation of a denser PCBM thin film and the better contact quality of the PCBM/MAPbI3 heterojunction. Besides, the power-dependent current density-voltage (J-V) curves show that the lower defect density in the solar cells results in the higher VOC. In other words, the treatment of a saturated BCP/IPA solution can decrease the defect density of the PCBM/MAPbI3 heterojunction and thereby boosting the photovoltaic performance and extending the device lifespan.

Abstract: Metastatic Breast Cancer has a poor 25% survival rate and currently there are no clinical therapeutics which target metastasis. ‘Migrastatics’ are a new drug class which target migration pathway effector proteins in order to inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are essential drivers of breast cancer cell migration and invasion through their regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Therefore, the PAKs present as attractive migrastatic candidates. Here we review how PAKs regulate distinct aspects of breast cancer actin dynamics focussing on cytoskeletal reorganisation, cell:matrix adhesion, actomyosin contractility and degradative invasion. Lastly, we discuss the introduction of PAK migrastatics into the well-honed breast cancer clinical pipeline.

Abstract: The recognition of broadband and high-absorption solar energy has increased interest in the application of solar energy. In the present study, we use the particle swarm optimization and the finite-difference time-domain (PSO/FDTD) algorithm to design an optimal patternless solar absorber. This absorber contains a multilayer common metal‒dielectric flat film that enables perfect absorption within the broadband solar energy spectrum. The average absorption rate of the solar energy absorber associates with the proposed inverse design method for the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm is 98.2%. The performance of the absorber is stable within the incidence angle range of 0–40°, irrespective of whether the polarization mode is transverse electric or transverse magnetic, and the absorption performance remains high at a high incidence angle of 60°. The proposed 2-inch diameter solar energy absorber can be heated to 86 °C within 100 s, indicating a heating power of 950 W m−2. The proposed absorber has a simple structure, low manufacturing cost, perfect ultra-wideband absorption that is independent of polarization, high thermal conversion performance, and substantial potential for solar energy applications.

Abstract: Solar tracking maximizes the amount of electricity generated by photovoltaic (PV) panels throughout the day. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand the effects of the topology on the degradation of PV modules. Thus, a methodology is described in this paper to predict changes in the degradation and performance over the lifetime of PV panels according to solar tracking topology. A technical and economic analysis of an experimental system built in UFSM (Santa Maria-RS, Brazil) is used to discuss typical configurations with and without solar tracking. Computational simulations were performed in the OpenDSS, Matlab and Homer programs for a period of 25 years. The results show an increase up to 2.43% in the accumulated degradation at the end of the simulated period by using a solar panel tracking compared to the fixed topology. In compensation, solar tracking increased annual electricity generation by an average of 20.87% proving that this topology is technically and economically quite feasible.

Abstract: RbF post-deposition treatments have been explored in the literature for increasing the open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and hence the efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. However, given the few papers documenting the experimental steps, it was difficult to quickly reproduce the results. This contribution describes some of the optimization steps that led to a successful RbF PDT based on device performance. We present results that put boundaries on the temperatures of the RbF cell and the lamp (for sample heating) setpoint. The best recipe for our specific growth process is documented in detail so that others may copy the procedure and possibly arrive at a successful RbF PDT in a reasonable time.

Abstract: The black-to-transmissive electrochromic polymer has significant value with practical applications. Integration of electrochromic and supercapacitor bifunctional materials can indicate its capacitor level by visual color change in real-time. In this paper, based on three EDOT derivative monomers were associated to phenanthrocarbazole/benzotriazole/benzothiadiazole, M1, M2 and M3, a novel ternary random copolymer film was successfully prepared by electrochemical copolymerization. Since the corresponding homopolymers of three monomers are red, green and blue in the neutral state respectively, and their oxidation states are all transparent, therefore the obtained ternary random copolymer films show the black-to-transmissive electrochromic behavior. The copolymer film pCo-2 was prepared via electrochemical copolymerization with suitable monomers feed ratio (1: 1.5: 1 of M1: M2: M3). Benefit from ternary random electrochemical copolymerization, the pCo-2 copolymer displays excellent electrochromic-supercapacitor properties among the similar bifunctional materials, with fast response time, high optical contrast, good cycling stability and large area (volume) specific capacitance. The electrochromic supercapacitor device based on pCo-2//PEDOT can make an LCD run continuously. This work provides an available general approach to realizing black-to-transmissive electrochromism towards electrochromic-supercapacitor bifunctional applications.

Abstract: Antimony selenide is a potential material among 2D materials for photovoltaic applications due to its broad absorption range from visible to NIR. In thin-film photodetector, the formation of Sb2O3 limits the device's photocurrent and low bias operation. This work compares a Sb2Se3 microrod-based device and a thin film-based device. Because of the lower bandgap than the film-based Sb2Se3, the microrod-based device showed a broadband photoresponse in near-IR and visible regions. The photocurrent was measured at 1064 nm wavelength with variable power for the microrod-based device. The device offered a responsitivity of 0.036 mA/W and external quantum efficiency of 42 % at 1064 nm and 12 mW/cm2 power density. Also, the photocurrent increased from nano-Amps to the micro-Amps for the rod. Given the high response and low bias operation, the present device paves a path for a new device with a simple processing method.

Abstract: Electrodeposition is a promising method to fabricate Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (i.e., CZTSSe) absorber layer thanks to its many advantages such as low-cost and large-scale. However, the secondary phases and intrinsic defects in electrodeposited CZTSSe solar cells inevitably limit the photoelectric performance. Herein, two different kind of precursor films (binary-ternary selenide vs. quaternary selenide) are deliberately fabricated and the effect of these precursors on the secondary phases and intrinsic defects of CZTSSe absorber layer are investigated comprehensively. The absorber layer obtained from binary-ternary selenide precursor has a small amount of ZnSe secondary phases and CuSn deep defects, whereas that obtained from the quaternary selenide precursor exhibits the favorable VCu shallow defects, which is beneficial to the efficiency improvement in CZTSSe. Based on the quaternary selenide precursor film, the CZTSSe solar cell with 10.03% total area efficiency (the active area efficiency is 10.9%) was obtained. This is the highest efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells prepared by the electrodeposition method.

In this study, a novel type of microcapsule for thermal energy storage based on an n-eicosane core and a phenol-formaldehyde resin shell was fabricated via in-situ polymerization process. The research studied the effects of the emulsification concentration, core/shell mass ratio and agitation speed on the thermal properties and morphology of microcapsules to confirm the optimal reaction conditions. The chemical compositions, surface morphology and thermal properties and stability were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (X-ray diffractometer, XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (field emission scanning electron microscopy, FSEM), transmission electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy, TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC), respectively. The synthesized microcapsules were found to show a relatively spherical shape and a well-defined core-shell structure as well as a compact shell. Furthermore, the results showed that when the emulsification concentration was 1%, the core/shell mass ratio was 3:6.47, the agitation speed is 1000r/min, the highest encapsulation efficiency and energy storage efficiency achieve 84.2% and 83.4%, respectively, meanwhile the melting enthalpy and phase transition temperature of the obtained microcapsules reached as high as 173.83 J g-1 and 36.6 °C. In addition, the microcapsule samples prepared under optimal condition also exhibited an excellent thermal reliability even after 500th thermal cycles.

Abstract: Recently, stacks consisting of an ultrathin SiO2 coated with atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) have been shown to yield state-of-the-art passivation of n-type crystalline silicon surfaces and provide low contact resistivities to n+-doped Si and poly-Si surfaces. Key for achieving good surface passivation are an intentionally-grown SiO2 interlayer, an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) capping layer and a post-deposition anneal, whereas n-type doping of the ZnO is required to achieve a low contact resistivity. In this work, we present the latest results and insights obtained for this contact stack. This includes a study of the minimum required thicknesses of both the ZnO and the Al2O3 capping layer to achieve a high passivation level after post-deposition anneal. Also, we provide details on how to remove the Al2O3 capping layer selectively from the ZnO:Al after the post-deposition anneal using a pH-controlled wet-etch, such that the ZnO:Al can be contacted by a metal. Whereas previous work was based on lab-scale temporal ALD, in this work we highlight the industrialization potential by demonstrating that these layers can be prepared by spatial ALD, yielding good passivation levels on both undiffused n-type and n+-diffused c-Si surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of ALD to deposit ZnO:Al layers selectively on oxidized regions of an otherwise HF-last treated c-Si surface. Such area-selective deposition opens up potential pathways for local, self-aligned contact formation. Altogether, this work provides valuable insights into the working mechanism and practical aspects of ZnO:Al-based passivating contacts.

Abstract: To improve the overall solar-thermal energy harvesting efficiency of encapsulated phase change materials (EPCM), a novel hierarchic SiO2/PCN-224/PB (ES-PCN-PB) composite shell was developed and synthesized through in-situ growth of PCN-224 decorated with PB particles onto SiO2 encapsulated PCM. The corresponding topologies, chemical characteristics, crystallinity, optical properties, and thermal induction capacity of the ES-PCN-PB capsules were thoroughly evaluated. The articulated strategy attained phase-change enthalpies of about 124.15 J/g, with a differential temperature of 28.88 ± 0.22 °C achieving a magnified photothermal energy conversion efficiency of 96.20% due to the broadband solar spectrum absorbance and effective light to heat conversion through the electron-hole generation and non-radiative relaxation. The combination of PCN-224 and PB decorated shell was realized to be a practical approach to improve structural stability, durability, and light-harvesting ability. The coupling of the two MOFs insinuates broad spectral absorption and photothermal conversion improvement which augments a considerable contribution to straightforward solar energy harvesting in numerous PCM applications such as temperature management of greenhouses, solar water heating systems, solar cookers, and solar-thermal electricity generating systems.

Abstract: We report on a new class of metamaterials, which consists of meta-foams, optimized for high performance in enhanced solar steam generation. The design of these meta-foams involves precise dimensional control of a periodic two-dimensional micro-pore array. Proof-of-concept of meta-foams efficiency is demonstrated using two fabrication technologies. The first one involves microscale plasma etching onto a nanostructured black silicon substrate. As an alternative low-cost technique, we also use 3D printing of a graphene-containing polymer material. The experimental validation shows that the best evaporation rate reaches 1.34 kg/(h·m2) under 1 sun illumination, in open-air conditions under normal temperature and relative humidity conditions of 20 °C and 58%, an unmatched value so far under similar conditions, while the theoretical limit is estimated at 1.5 kg/(h·m2). This corresponding to a 89% conversion efficiency. Experimental data concur well with the predicted performance obtained by numerical simulations. The proposed model simultaneously accounts for both heat and mass transfer, including photothermal conversion and water phase change, to guide the optimization towards the maximization of the evaporation rate, an important figure of merit in many applications, including solar heat harvesting and solar water purification.

Abstract: Half of today's global energy consumption is in the form of heating and cooling. Solar collectors are the most promising sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in this sector. The most important component in a solar collector is the receiver, which by use of a selective surface absorbs and converts solar irradiance to thermal energy. Herein, a novel selective surface for low-to mid-temperature solar collectors is developed, studied and presented. The surface is produced by electroplating a cobalt-chromium coating on a stainless steel substrate using an electrolyte based on a deep eutectic solvent. Our method makes use of trivalent instead of traditionally used hexavalent chromium, which significantly reduces health-related issues and makes it more environmentally benign. We obtain a coating of chromium doped cobalt where the surface exhibits an absorptance and emittance of 0.96 and 0.14, respectively, giving it a solar-to-thermal efficiency of 0.95. An observed loss in optical efficiency, is shown to correlate to an oxidation of the metallic cobalt to Co3O4 at elevated temperatures. We further show that this oxidation can be mitigated by dip-coating a protective silica top coating, which concurrently improves the optical selectivity of the surface. The present selective surface is efficient, cheap, scalable, and easy to produce sustainably, making it competitive to industry standards. We foresee that our method will have impact on the advancement of improved low-to mid-temperature solar collectors, assisting a faster transition towards a sustainable society.

Abstract: Muscular dysplasia is a common muscle disease, but its pathological mechanism is still unclear. Adipose is originally identified as a highly conservative and widely expressed anti-obesity gene, and our previous study has reported that Adipose is also a positive regulator of myogenesis. Considering the vital role of during muscle development, this study was to demonstrate a potential relationship between Sirtuin1 and Adipose and clarified the mechanism by which Adipose regulated muscle development. Our results showed that the muscle fiber cross-sectional area and myosin heavy chain protein level were significantly reduced in Sirtuin1+/- mice. Moreover, the longitudinal section of muscle fibers was obviously irregular. Sirtuin1 knockdown significantly reduced the expression levels of Adipose and its upstream transcriptional regulator Kruppel like factor 15 and notably inhibited the AMP-activated protein kinase α-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. However, Adipose over-expression activated this signaling pathway and promoted mitochondrial biosynthesis in C2C12 myoblasts. Adipose over-expression also enhanced glucose absorption of C2C12 cells, suggesting the increased needs for cells for metabolic substrates. In C2C12 cells with hydrogen peroxide treatment, Adipose over-expression repressed hydrogen peroxide-elicited apoptosis and mitochondrial loss, while Sirtuin1-specific inhibitor dramatically weakened these roles of Adipose. Taken together, our findings reveal that Adipose rescues the adverse effects of Sirtuin1 deficiency or hydrogen peroxide on muscle development by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase α- peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α pathway to promote mitochondria synthesis, which provides theoretical basis for developing new therapeutic targets against some muscle diseases.

Abstract: Although great advances have been made in low-cost manufacturing of air-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the moisture degradation of halide perovskite films remains a key problem to be urgently solved. High-quality perovskite films with large grains and uniform coverage are essential to enhance the performance of PSCs with high efficiency and moisture stability. Herein, heavy water (D2O) is employed as an additive in PbI2 precursor to manipulate the average grain size and enhance surface coverage of perovskite film, resulting in improved humidity stability of PSCs under ambient conditions. It is found that the introduction of D2O effectively improves the quality of perovskite film and significantly reduces the grain boundaries for reduced carrier recombination. The optimal concentration of D2O can boost the in-plane growth of perovskite films and increase the average grain size of perovskite from 494 nm to 717 nm. Consequently, the PSCs based on the perovskite film with 1% D2O exhibits a superior PCE of 21.66% (0.055 cm2) in small area, which is 9.78% higher than that of the control device (19.73%). In addition, the large-area (1 cm2) PSCs with 1% D2O show an efficiency of 20.02%. The unencapsulated PSCs made with 1% D2O can remain 95% of its initial PCE after aging 60 days in ambient air under dark with 20–25% relative humidity.

Abstract: A supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle solar power system based on solid particle thermal energy storage is proposed to enhance the efficiency of concentrated solar power (CSP). The effective thermal conductivity and thermal cycling stability of solid particles are crucial for sCO2 CSP applications. Some natural and artificial solid particles, such as black silicon carbide, green silicon carbide, white corundum, brown corundum, brown ceramsite sand, garnet, river sand and desert sand are considered as potential thermal energy storage medium due to its low cost and easy availability in large quantities. However, there are few studies about the effective thermal conductivity and stability of these solid particles after thermal cycling tests. In this study, the effective thermal conductivity of these solid particles was measured by the hot wire method. Particularly, the effective thermal conductivity of black silicon carbide and green silicon carbide was measured by modified hot wire method. In addition, the changes of mass, real density, bulk density, void fraction and mean diameter of the above-mentioned solid particles after 100 times thermal cycling tests were also recorded to analyze thermal cycling stability. Based on the results of all the above tests, green silicon carbide exhibits high effective thermal conductivity and good thermal cycling stability, which presents a great potential as a thermal energy storage medium.

Abstract: Surface arrays of photoactive materials with subwavelength dimensions are important for energy harvesting applications due to their capacity for broadband and omnidirectional absorption of the solar radiation. It was recently proposed and demonstrated that the absorption performance of such arrays can be further amplified with the introduction of additional nano-features. In the current work we consider the incorporation of nano-features into nanopillar (NP) arrays. The considered nano-features are: quasi-nanolenses, sidewall nano-decorations, and decreasing the NP bottom diameter to transform it into a light funnel (LF). The underlying various light trapping mechanisms are examined using near-field microscopy. Near-field microscopy is used to obtained both high-resolution far-field imaging, as well as mapping of the near-field photon distributions of the arrays. Firstly, it is shown that the main contribution to far-field reflected photons is from the ambient surrounding the silicon structures. Secondly, the incorporation of the various nano-features induces a decrease in the reflected far-field photons which originate from this ambient region. Also, it is shown how the incorporation of quasi-nanolenses concludes a decrease in far-field photons reflected in the oblique directions with high polar angles, whereas the incorporation of sidewall nano-decorations leads to a decrease in far-field photons reflected in directions of small polar angles. Also, the incorporation of both qNL and sidewall nano-decorations is examined, and light trapping with the LF geometry is discussed and demonstrated. Finally, understanding the underlying light trapping mechanisms will support the deterministic design of subwavelength arrays incorporated with nano-features for efficient harvesting of the solar radiation.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a malignant tumor that begins in the colorectal mucosal epithelium. NPM1 is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that has been linked to tumor progression in humans. NPM1 is significantly overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer, but its role and mechanism in colorectal cancer remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to discover the role of NPM1 in promoting colorectal cancer proliferation via PRDX6 and its molecular mechanism. NPM1 knockdown or overexpression inhibited or promoted the proliferation and cell cycle progression of HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells, respectively, according to our findings. Furthermore, NPM1 knockdown or overexpression increased or decreased intracellular ROS levels. Animal experiments revealed that NPM1 knockdown or overexpression inhibited or promoted the growth of colorectal cancer cells transplanted subcutaneously. NPM1 knockdown or overexpression reduced or increased PRDX6 expression and related enzyme activities, respectively, according to our findings. NPM1 formed a complex with CBX3 as evidenced by immunoprecipitation, and the double luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that the CBX3-NPM1 complex promoted PRDX6 transcription. Our data support the role of NPM1 in promoting the proliferation of colorectal cancer, which may be accomplished by CBX3 promoting the expression of the antioxidant protein PRDX6 and thus inhibiting intracellular ROS levels. NPM1 and PRDX6 are potential colorectal cancer therapeutic targets.

Abstract: During the past decade sugar alcohols have been extensively studied for thermal storage purposes. One of the recent focuses of research has been in improving their heat charge and discharge rate by enhancing the thermal conductivity with different types of additives. However, the current literature shows a vast discrepancy in measured values of sugar alcohols. This work presents an experimental study on thermal conductivity of seven sugar alcohols. The aim is to find out the reason for the discrepancy of literature values for erythritol, mannitol and xylitol, and to present new reference data for galacticol, myo-inositol, maltitol and sorbitol. We study the impact of material preparation method, raw material grade and sensor contact on the crystalline structure and the conductivity. The crystalline structure was inspected with optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and melting properties with differential scanning calorimetry. We found that different polymorphs, grain structure and crystallite sizes can be obtained by different preparation methods. This caused the conductivity of mannitol, galacticol and myo-inositol to vary by tens of percentages. Crystallization temperatures of xylitol and erythritol were found to affect their grain size but had only a minor effect on the conductivity. Overall, the conductivities of solid phase sugar alcohols were found to be within the upper range of the previous literature; based on the methods of this work, we did not find any evidence for the low and intermediate values for erythritol, xylitol and mannitol. Due to the high amorphous content of maltitol and sorbitol their conductivity was substantially lower than that of the other sugar alcohols. Thermal conductivity of liquid phases was found to accurately follow a linear relationship with the molar mass for sugar alcohols with carbon number between 4 and 6.

Abstract: BiFeO3 as a p-type photocatalyst in BiFeO3–CdWO4 p-n heterojunction was modified by partial substitution of divalent Co2+ and Ni2+ at Fe-site to enhance the photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution from pure water splitting. At high impurity concentrations, XRD and Raman spectroscopy revealed a phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic/tetragonal with higher crystal symmetry due to larger ionic radii of Co2+ and Ni2+ relative to that of Fe3+. The excess amount of impurities also resulted in the formation of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), sillenite (Bi25FeO40) and mullite (Bi2Fe4O9) as secondary phases. The high resolution XPS spectra of O 1s and Fe 2p indicted that the concentration of oxygen vacancy and Fe2+: Fe3+ increased with doping BiFeO3, which is due to the structural distortion and defection. Moreover, magnetic property of BiFeO3 was promoted by Co and Ni doping so that the residual magnetization increased from 0.009 emu/g up to 0.061 and 0.068 emu/g by 9 mol.% doping of Ni and Co, respectively. The enhanced magnetism can be attributed to the net magnetic moment caused by different magnetic moment of Fe3+, Co2+ and Ni2+ as well as the structural defection that may be a reason for spin spiral suppression. Doping with Co and Ni led to reducing band gap energy, suppression of charge recombination, and increment of charge density and mobility. The efficiency of photocatalytic H2 evolution increased from 268.9 μmol/h gcat by pure BFO up to 449.6 and 494.7 μmol/h gcat by 9 mol.% Ni and Co doping, respectively.

Abstract: Energy and environmental concerns are becoming more prominent with the widespread use of high-power-consuming cooling devices. Radiative cooling has lately gained popularity as a new energy-saving and environmentally beneficial technique. Here, we fabricated a double-layered radiative cooling composite film by coating a metal aluminum (Al) sheet with a SiO2/TiO2/PDMS (STP) using the tape casting method. In the STP coating layer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is employed as the matrix material, and SiO2/TiO2 particles are dispersed evenly in it. The SiO2/TiO2/PDMS/Al (STP-Al) composite film shows 91% sunlight reflectivity and 83% atmospheric transparent window emissivity. An outdoor cooling test revealed that the STP-Al can provide a cooling effect of 5.3 ᵒC in direct sunlight with an intensity of 523 W m−2. Furthermore, it has excellent anti-fouling properties and superior strength, enabling it to be used outdoors for an extended time. Due to its superior performance and easy preparation procedures, it can be fabricated on a large scale and has a broad range of practical applications in daily life.

Abstract: Multi-layer systems are frequently used as anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) due to their excellent optical properties. However, these systems suffer from erosive degradation (wear), thus urgently seeking alternative ways to improve their mechanical properties while maintaining their optical response. To tackle this problem, we propose to dope multi-layer TiO2/SiO2 coatings with Zr-oxides to enhance their crystalline structure and density/compactness, as well as to form Si–Zr–O bonds. We explore the effect of Zr-oxide doping on the microstructure as well as the optical and mechanical properties of multi-layer TiO2/SiO2 coatings with the overall aim to synergistically induce enhanced optical and mechanical properties. Therefore, homogeneous 250 nm thick multi-layer TiO2/SiO2 coatings doped with Zr-oxides (different atomic concentrations) were deposited on glass substrates by magnetron sputtering. Based on our analysis, Zr-doping improves the optical and mechanical properties simultaneously. Among all ARCs, the sample annealed at 400 °C and doped with 1 at.-% Zr presented an excellent anti-reflective behavior and the best mechanical performance. These characteristics point towards an improved mechanical resistance (outstanding durability) and optical efficiency thus rendering them excellent candidates for the protection of glass covers on solar panels.

Abstract: Both improvements of water transportation and thermal management inevitably sacrifice the mechanical robustness of solar evaporators, while our anisotropic structure not only achieved the tradeoff between thermal insulation and water transportation, but also exhibited excellent structural strength. Herein, a bio-inspired molybdenum carbide/carbon-based aerogel constructed by a bidirectional freezing technique (noted as MoCCA1) is applied for solar steam generation. The biomimetic solar evaporator exhibits the anisotropic structure of lamellar layers with interconnected bridges for achieving low thermal conductivity (0.18027 W K−1 m−1) to suppress thermal dissipation and ultrafast water transportation. The desired MoCCA1 behaves an evaporation rate as high as ∼2.41 kg m−2 h−1 and a superb photothermal conversion efficiency of 95.8% under one sun illumination. The excellent durability and long-term stability of MoCCA1 allow for significantly practical application in terms of solar desalination. More importantly, the highly intensive thermal energy is effectively used for expediting the oil adsorption with the adsorption capacity of 7.72 g g−1. The well-designed structure opens up new horizons for sufficient utilization of solar energy for synchronous freshwater generation and adsorption oil.

The incorporation of additives into perovskite films can improve their quality and, thereby, provide high-performance PSCs. In this study, we introduced core-twisted tetrachloroperylene diimide (ClPDI) derivatives (n-type small molecules) into the lead iodide precursor solution and used a two-step deposition method to prepare methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films. We examined the effects of the terminal functional groups of the ClPDI derivatives—n-butyl (ClPDI-C4), dimethylaminopropyl (ClPDI-C3DMeA), and aminopropyl (ClPDI-DPA) — on their ability to control the crystallization rate and modulate the film morphology. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC prepared without an additive (15.88%) improved to 16.88 and 18.77% after incorporation of ClPDI-C4 and ClPDI-DPA, respectively, because the strong interactions between these additives and the perovskite passivated defects, slowed the rate of perovskite crystal growth, and increased the grain size. Thus, the use of ClPDI additives in perovskite films can effectively enhance both the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

Abstract: The fabrication of efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules via high throughput methods is a crucial milestone to facilitate their commercialization. The achievement of reliable printing and coating processes for large-scale modules has, however, been challenging thus far. Indeed, the performance gap is large between cells produced at lab-scale and those resulting from industrial methods. Therefore, understanding the critical steps in the upscaling process is decisive to address the research efforts towards decreasing the aforementioned gap. In this contribution, we analyze the efficiency losses associated with several of the main steps involved in the up-scaling pathway of the OPV devices, from lab-scale blade coating to pre-industrial slot die roll-to-roll coating. We show that when using materials in the active layer for which the performance is tolerant to thickness/microstructure variations, the critical steps are related to the charge carrier blocking layers, as well as potential losses due to parasitic absorption in the semitransparent electrodes.

Abstract: The limiting efficiencies of monofacial and bifacial GaAs/Si tandem solar cells are calculated from the physical properties of GaAs and Si, with light trapping by Lambertian scattering. The highest efficiency GaAs/Si tandem cells are obtained when there is an air gap between the GaAs and Si layers, which maximizes the voltage of the GaAs cell. A 4-terminal tandem air gap cell with GaAs layer 4 μm thick and Si layer 200 μm thick was found to have an efficiency of 40.5% under AM1.5G illumination. The highest efficiency 2-terminal air gap tandem (37.3%) has a 0.37 μm GaAs layer and a 200 μm thick Si layer for which the photocurrents in the cells are equal. For thicker GaAs layers the photocurrent in the GaAs exceeds the photocurrent in the Si and in this case the most efficient 2-terminal cells (36.1%) for GaAs 4 μm thick and Si 200 μm thick, are obtained when the two cells are in physical contact which maximizes the luminescent coupling. In this regime the efficiency is insensitive to current mismatch because of compensation from luminescent coupling. The efficiency of these cells is also insensitive to changes in rear illumination intensity in bifacial operation.

Abstract: Viral myocarditis (VMC) is the main cause of sudden acute heart failure and cardiac death in adolescents; however, treatment for VMC is limited. Trehalose is a natural non-reductive disaccharide that protects against cardiovascular diseases by inducing autophagy. The protective effect of trehalose on VMC and the specific mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we established a VMC mouse model, treated with trehalose in vivo, and cultured B cells from VMC mice with trehalose in vitro to elucidate the effect of trehalose on B cells in acute VMC. Trehalose alleviated myocardial injury in VMC mice and increased the number of autophagosomes, LC3II/LC3I ratio, and expression level of LAMP2, whereas it decreased the expression of p62 in VMC-B cells. Bafilomycin A1 suppressed VMC-B cell autophagy induced by trehalose. At the mechanistic level, trehalose treatment significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 in VMC-B cells. Dorsomorphin and SBI-0206965 abolished the increased phosphorylation level and altered the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In conclusion, trehalose alleviates myocardial inflammatory damage of VMC by inducing B cell autophagy, mediated by the AMPK/ULK1 signalling pathway. Thus, trehalose may be a potentially useful molecule for alleviating myocardial injury in VMC.

Abstract: Nanoparticle-enhanced molten salt phase change materials have been used extensively for thermal energy storage. However, the role of nanoparticles in enhancing the specific heat capacity remains elusive with contradicting reports. In this work, to clarify the mechanism behind the specific heat enhancement in nanoparticle (SiO2) embedded nitrate (NaNO3–KNO3) and carbonate (Li2CO3–K2CO3) molten salts. Due to the surface charges on nanoparticles, an orderly layered distribution of molten salt ions near the surface is observed in molecular dynamics simulations, which lead to higher electrostatic potential energies near the nanoparticle surface. This makes the ionic layers with the same charge type easier to expand when temperature rises, leading to a larger local thermal expansion coefficient. Since the thermal expansion coefficient is positively correlated with the specific heat based on the phonon interpolation, the increased local thermal expansion coefficient is the main reason for the enhancement in the specific heat. The enhancement in the specific heat and the enrichment of charged functional groups on the nanoparticle surface are also confirmed experimentally. The specific heat can be significantly enhanced, by up to 19% here with 1 wt% nanoparticle, after we tailor the surface chemistry of nanoparticles, in particular, by coating active functional groups such as hydroxyl groups on the surface. This study clarifies the fundamental role of surface changes on nanoparticles in enhancing the specific heat of molten salts, and suggests that nanoparticles can have higher surface charge densities, if protonated in an acidic environment, can lead to larger specific heat enhancement in molten salts.

Abstract: The polarization and long-term dipping corrosion behaviors of pristine and Ni-coated Incoloy 800H (800H) alloys were investigated in the eutectic MgCl2–KCl molten salt at different temperatures and compared their performance with expensive Haynes 230 (H230) alloy. The corrosion rates of all the studied alloys increased with temperature. The corrosion rates obtained from the electrochemical study showed Ni-coating increases the corrosion resistance of 800H alloy. Further, the linear polarization measurements were also performed at different temperatures to investigate the effect of Ni-coating on the exchange-current density. A long-term corrosion study showed that 800H has a higher corrosion rate than H230. However, Ni-coating significantly decreased the corrosion rate of 800H (even lower than H230) in the molten MgCl2–KCl salt. A diffusion model for Ni-coated 800H was presented to describe the diffusion behavior of Cr, Fe, and Ni elements in the Ni-coated 800H alloy in a long-term corrosion study. The diffusion model was simulated based on the partial differential equations and known initial boundary conditions. The simulated result is compared with experimental data by altering the diffusion coefficient and reasonable values of diffusion coefficients of Cr, Fe, and Ni in 800H alloy and Ni-coating. The estimated diffusion coefficient (D) values in the Ni-coating from 800H alloy are in the range of 2–4 × 10−11 cm2 s˗1, 4–6 × 10−11 cm2 s˗1, and 5–8 × 10−11 cm2 s˗1 for Cr, Fe, and Ni, respectively. The overall results indicated that Ni-coated 800H could be employed as a suitable alternative construction material for solar thermal energy storage containers.

Abstract: We have experimentally determined the main thermodynamic properties of SrCl2, a potentially promising salt for thermochemical heat storage. We found a high energy density of 2.4 ± 0.1 GJ/m3 and proved full cyclability for at least 10 cycles going from the anhydrate to the hexahydrate without chemical degradation. We have experimentally determined the thermodynamic equilibria for each individual transition and the corresponding metastable zones. We find that the metastable zone is widest for the anhydrate to monohydrate transition and decreases with each subsequent hydration step. We have also established that the observed nucleation kinetics are highly dependent on the preparation of the sample. Depending on the preparation conditions, some seeds of the precursor phase can remain in the sample thereby influencing the induction times for the transition. In heat storage applications we recommend selecting conditions well away from the phase transition lines (at least outside the metastable zone) and to leave some seeds of the phase to be transferred in order to increase the transition speed.

Abstract: Molten salt nanofluids have become a hot research topic due to its excellent thermal properties and heat transfer performance. However, there is a few research on the effect of nanofluids on the corrosion of metal materials. In order to know the influence of molten salt nanofluids on the corrosion of stainless steel, a low melting point quaternary nitrate was used as the base salt to analyze the corrosion law of nanofluids. By means of weight loss method, two different stainless steels (304, 316L) were put into the molten salt nanofluids with SiO2 nanoparticles content of 1 wt% to test the corrosion behavior of stainless steel. The results of 500 h corrosion test revealed that the corrosion rate of mixed molten salt on 304 and 316L stainless steel is reduced by the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles. The corrosion rates of molten salt nanofluids on 304 and 316L stainless steel were 0.0433 mm/y and 0.0233 mm/y, respectively. The surface morphology analysis by SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS test showed that the reticular silica nanostructures corrosion layer was formed on the surface of stainless steel, such structure can inhibit the corrosion of stainless steel. Therefore, molten salt nanofluids have the good compatibility with metal materials, and adding nanoparticles in molten salt can reduce the corrosion on stainless steel.

Abstract: Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and promotes PCa progression in in vivo through the ADMA-NO pathway by degrading nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and monomethylamine arginine (L-NMMA). In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the overexpression of DDAH1 in PCa and examined its potential role as a therapeutic target. We observed that DDAH1expression is elevated in PCa (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145) cell lines under hypoxia. ChIP and reporter assay results confirmed that DDAH1 expression is positively regulated by HIF-1α through directly binding to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) located within the promoter region between − 1242/− 1238 upstream of its transcription start site (TSS). Under hypoxia, HIF-1α is translocated into the nucleus and activates its target gene expression in PC3 cells. Interestingly, in the event of HIF-1α inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown, an alternative transcription factor Nrf2 promotes DDAH1 expression through antioxidant response elements (AREs) on its promoter. ChIP assay results showed that Nrf2 binds to AREs located between –1016 / −1008 bp from the TSS of DDAH1. Furthermore, knockdown of PCa therapeutic target HSP90, an essential co-factor for both HIF-1α and Nrf2 causes attenuation of hypoxia induced DDAH1 overexpression in PCa cells. These results demonstrate that hypoxia induced upregulation of DDAH1 expression is positively regulated by HIF-1α and Nrf2 in association with HSP90. Therefore, targeting tumor angiogenesis promoting DDAH1 along with standard androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapy may offer an effective strategy to prevent PCa progression.

Abstract: The weathering performance of polymeric backsheets is most accurately assessed by outdoor exposure to natural weathering and examination of their performance characteristics by observing changes in properties. The main drawback of natural weathering is the long exposure time. Therefore, also existing qualification tests for photovoltaic (PV) components suggest accelerated artificial aging tests. This should lead to similar materials degradation as long-term outdoor exposures cause. However, it is necessary to establish connections between field performance of polymer products and accelerated materials durability testing in order to better predict the service life of a polymer product. Therefore, the main focus of this work was to evaluate the effect of natural and artificial aging on multilayer backsheet films for PV modules. For this reason, different backsheet films were naturally and artificially aged. Subsequently the optical, chemical, mechanical and thermal properties were characterized. In general, only some changes in properties after up to 3000 h of accelerated aging can be correlated with natural weathering for 2.5 years. The degradation mechanism of the polymeric part during natural weathering has to be considered when trying to simulate natural aging conditions in order to choose the right parameters for artificial aging. Thus, the right test design for artificial aging tests is highly important, as well as the consideration of the degradation mechanisms when trying to simulate natural aging conditions.

Abstract: Waterborne and solvent-based coatings with prominent passive subambient daytime radiative cooling (RC) coatings were fabricated to conserve cooling energy in the summer. Concurrently, water- and alcohol-based superamphiphobic self-cleaning coatings were manufactured and introduced into the RC coatings as topcoats. The contact angles of water and n-hexadecane of the superamphiphobic topcoat containing coating systems were 163.4° and 151.4°, respectively; additionally, the sliding angles of water and n-hexadecane of these systems were 2° and 9°, respectively. Moreover, the introduction of a transparent superamphiphobic topcoat to the RC coatings did not affect their originally high solar reflectance but improved their emissivity values in the atmospheric transparency window, wavelengths between 2.5 and 24 μm, and the entire infrared spectrum due to the presence of plenty of silicon-oxygen bonds formed via hydrolysis and/or alcoholysis reactions and the subsequent co-polycondensation of tetraethoxysilane and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The solar reflectance of the coating system was 0.986, which is the highest recorded worldwide. The emissivity of the superamphiphobic RC coatings in the atmospheric transparency window was 0.954. The superamphiphobic RC coatings possessed excellent static and dynamic non-wetting capabilities, significantly improving their water resistance, waterproofing properties, and anti-graffiti performance. Additionally, the superamphiphobic RC coatings exhibited outstanding self-cleaning properties, preventing the coating surfaces from being contaminated by dust, soiling, grime, and water/oil-soluble pollutants, thereby enabling them to maintain an extremely high solar reflectance.

Abstract: We simulated a tin selenide (SnSe) based solar cell device in a standard planar substrate configuration (glass/Mo/SnSe/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al) using a Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) software to elucidate a path to higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). A baseline model for the device was simulated and established using the experimental results of our recent study on a 2.51% device. A stepwise fitting procedure observed a higher effective density of states in SnSe, along with a band offset of −0.11 eV for conduction between SnSe and CdS; these factors are responsible for limiting the open-circuit voltage (VOC). We optimized the buffer and absorber layer parameters to improve the working capabilities to achieve higher efficiency by improving VOC. In particular, the effects of carrier concentration, absorber–buffer interface recombination, absorber thickness, buffer layer thickness, and defect densities were studied and analyzed in detail via simulation. Interestingly, optimal absorber and buffer layer thicknesses of 1.2 μm and 60 nm were obtained for the baseline and simulated devices. Finally, a NiO back-surface field (BSF) layer was introduced, and its performance was evaluated. Significant improvements in VOC and fill factor (FF) were observed with implementing the NiO BSF layer at the SnSe/CdS interface. The optimal device without a BSF layer exhibited a maximum efficiency of 13.79% with a VOC of 0.590 V; a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 36.28 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64.33%. Finally, the highest PCE of 22.69% with a VOC of 0.818 V, JSC of 33.65 mA cm−2, and FF of 82.41% was observed after applying the BSF layer.

Abstract: The thermodynamics and kinetics of the structural phase transition from monoclinic VO2 (M) to rutile VO2 (R) and vice versa were studied for particulate materials obtained by bead milling of VO2 (M) powder. Using wet bead milling, we decreased the particle size of VO2 (M) powder from ∼1 μm to 129 nm. With progressive milling, the switching enthalpy decreased from 47 J g−1 to 29 J g−1 due to a loss of crystallinity. The switching kinetics were studied using Friedman's differential isoconversional method. The activation energy |Eα| decreases with increasing difference between the actual temperature of the material and its switching temperature (T0). Furthermore, |Eα| decreases with progressive milling, and kinetic asymmetry is induced. For milled particulate materials, |Eα| is lower for the switch from VO2 (R) to VO2 (M) than for the opposite switch. For hydrothermally synthesized nanoparticles, |Eα| is in the same order of magnitude, albeit with inverse switching asymmetry. Latter may result from different defects that are introduced during both preparation techniques. Applying layers of milled particulate material to glass sheets yielded thermochromic coatings with luminous transmission of 40.7% and solar modulation of 8.3%. This demonstrates that milled VO2 particles have potential for use in energy efficient thermochromic windows.

Abstract: Passivated contact cell architectures have the potential for higher efficiencies than the currently dominant PERC technology. Further development requires greater understanding of the passivation mechanism and potential surface related degradation, especially at polysilicon-oxide-crystalline silicon contacts. In particular, the hydrogenation provided by high temperature firing of dielectrics has been shown to govern both initial passivation and subsequent degradation at this interface. Given the nanoscale dimensions of the tunnelling oxide, assessing the concentration of hydrogen at the interface is a complex task. In this work we use atom probe tomography to demonstrate the capacity to resolve hydrogen atoms at this interface. Atom probe tomography can provide improved depth resolution via 3D reconstructions of the elemental atomic distributions at the interface. We propose a route towards atomic scale measurements of hydrogen across a thin tunnelling oxide, which can enable further understanding of charge carrier flow at or near this interface. We show that the ability to characterise hydrogen at the nanoscale is crucially limited by the residual gas present during the atom probe measurement. Therefore deuterium, as a surrogate for naturally abundant hydrogen, is recommended to accurately provide less ambiguous determination of hydrogen concentrations at the atom scale in such structures. However, even with the use of deuterium challenges remain, and the analysis and interpretation of the data must be undertaken with care. Such atom scale characterisation can provide critical information on the role that hydrogen plays in passivating contact interfaces.

Abstract: Shingled solar cells based on electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) interconnection have emerged as a commercially viable option for photovoltaic (PV) modules with attractive attributes including no soldering process (lead-free), tight packing with no gap between cells, and resulting efficiency gains. Reliability of such modules is, however, less certain due to the lack of long-term outdoor performance data. Here we report numerical simulation of thermo-mechanical stress in shingled solar cells using finite element modelling, and identify stress concentration in silicon in the interconnect region not anticipated from simpler analytical models. We also present design and fabrication of samples using ECA interconnection with geometry and characteristics that closely match production modules for realistic fatigue testing under cyclic loading. The setup is combined with real-time electrical measurements that permit monitoring of fatigue-induced changes in the electrical resistance of ECA joint. Detailed measurements are presented using samples with different types ECA and varying patterns of the glue-line aimed at evaluating reduced material usage for cost-reduction. This study demonstrates that the sample structure and experimental setup presented here can be effectively used to evaluate electrical and mechanical degradation of shingled PV modules to guide their design process.

Abstract: Various inhibitors are produced during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass that can interfere with the growth of yeast cells and the production of bioethanol. Formic acid is a common weak acid inhibitor present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate that has toxic effects on yeast cells. However, the mechanism of the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to formic acid is not fully understood. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to investigate the effects of formic acid treatment on cell metabolites of S. cerevisiae. Treatment with different concentrations of formic acid significantly inhibited the growth of yeast cells, reduced the yield of ethanol, prolonged the cell fermentation cycle, and increased the content of malondialdehyde. Principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that 55 metabolites were significantly altered in S. cerevisiae after formic acid treatment. The metabolic relevance of these compounds in the response of S. cerevisiae to formic acid stress was investigated. Formic acid can cause oxidative stress, inhibit protein synthesis, and damage DNA in S. cerevisiae, and these are possible reasons for the inhibition of S. cerevisiae cell growth. In addition, the levels of several aromatic amino acids identified in the cells of formic acid-treated yeast were increased; the biosynthesis of nucleotides was slowed, and energy consumption was reduced. These mechanisms may help to improve the tolerance of yeast cells to formic acid. The results described herein highlight our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of the response of S. cerevisiae to formic acid. The study will provide a theoretical basis for research on the tolerance mechanisms of S. cerevisiae.

Abstract: Different hierarchical architectures of ZnO were synthesized via optimization of ethylenediamine (EDA) concentration in a simple low-temperature hydrothermal route and their various photoanode characteristics are effectively used in superior DSSC performance. In a sequence of morphological changes from the nanoparticles to nanorods and the nanoflowers structures, gradually and systematically, the zinc-interstitial and oxygen-vacancy related phases reduce, bandgap redshifts relative to its bulk structure, surface area increases and the dye-loading capacity improves. In photoanodes with ZnO nanoflower structures, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency gradually increases to ∼46.6% via significant photo-absorption by a larger number of dye-molecules adsorbed on its enhanced specific surface area and via its high dye-loading capacity that facilitate an amplified photogeneration of electrons upon light-exposure on the DSSC. Furthermore, the lowest charge transfer resistance and hence an improved charge transport pathway prevailing in the device consequences superior photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs, which gradually advances to ∼4.42%, via increasing the short-circuit current density (JSC) to ∼10.75 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) to 0.73 V. Morphological changes in the ZnO nanostructures are demonstrated to significantly influence the photovoltaic performance when used as an effective photoanode of the DSSCs, which has never been reported earlier.

Abstract: In this study, an InN photocathode consisting of ZnO nanowire arrays was proposed as a cathode for a photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) solar energy converter. To optimize the performance of the device, we applied InN with a phonon bottleneck effect to the PETE converter. The theoretical model for PETE conversion with this complex photocathode was developed based on one-dimensional continuous equations and boundary conditions. We simulated and analyzed the conversion efficiency as a function of operating temperature, solar concentration, surface electron affinity, and operating voltage. Furthermore, we verified the feasibility of the proposed cathode through experiments on the current-voltage characteristics of the InN photocathode at different temperatures. The results of simulations and experiments indicated that InN is a promising photocathode material and may enable high-performance PETE devices.
