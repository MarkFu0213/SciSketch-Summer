Abstract: Actomyosin network under the plasma membrane of cells forms a cortical layer that regulates cellular deformations during different processes. What regulates the cortex? Characterized by its thickness, it is believed to be regulated by actin dynamics, filament-length regulators and myosin motor proteins. However, its regulation by cellular morphology (e.g. cell spread area) or mechanical microenvironment (e.g. substrate stiffness) has remained largely unexplored. In this study, super- and high-resolution imaging of actin in CHO cells demonstrates that at high spread areas (>450 μm2), the cortex is thinner, better separated as layers, and sensitive to deactivation of myosin II motors or reduction of substrate stiffness (and traction forces). In less spread cells (<400 μm2) such perturbations do not elicit a response. Myosin IIA's mechanosensing is limited here due to its lowered actin-bound fraction and higher turnover rate. Cofilin, in line with its competitive inhibitory role, is found to be overexpressed in these cells. To establish the causal relation, we initiate a spread area drop by de-adhesion and find enhanced actin dynamics and fragmentation along with oscillations and increase in thickness. This is more correlated to the reduction of traction forces than the endocytosis-based reduction in cell volume. Cortex thickness control by spread area is also found be true during differentiation of THP-1 monocytes to macrophages. Thus, we propose that spread area regulates cortex and its thickness by traction-based mechanosensing of myosin II.

Abstract: The perinuclear stacks of the Golgi apparatus maintained by dynamic microtubules are essential for cell migration. Activation of Akt (protein kinase B, PKB) negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-mediated tau phosphorylation, which enhances tau binding to microtubules and microtubule stability. In this study, experiments were performed on developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 2 (DRG2)-stably knockdown HeLa cells to determine whether knockdown of DRG2 in HeLa cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) affects microtubule dynamics, perinuclear Golgi stacking, and cell migration. Here, we show that DRG2 plays a key role in regulating microtubule stability, perinuclear Golgi stack formation, and cell migration. DRG2 knockdown prolonged the EGF receptor (EGFR) localization in endosome, enhanced Akt activity and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β. Tau, a target of GSK3β, was hypo-phosphorylated in DRG2-knockdown cells and showed greater association with microtubules, resulting in microtubule stabilization. DRG2-knockdown cells showed defects in microtubule growth and microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), Golgi fragmentation, and loss of directional cell migration. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for DRG2 in the regulation of perinuclear Golgi stacking and cell migration via its effects on GSK3β phosphorylation, and microtubule stability.

Abstract: Lead (Pb) is a known nephrotoxicant that causes damage to proximal tubular cells. PERK pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal diseases, but its role in Pb-induced nephrotoxicity remains largely unknown. In this study, data showed that Pb could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis in primary rat proximal tubular (rPT) cells, indicating the activation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway due to excessive ER stress. Pb-activated PERK pathway can be effectively inhibited by 4-phenylbutyric acid and PERK gene silencing, respectively; whereas continuously up-regulated by tunicamycin (TM) treatment. Moreover, Pb-induced apoptosis and inhibition of autophagic flux in rPT cells were significantly augmented and aggravated by co-treatment with TM, respectively. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the PERK pathway results in alleviation of apoptosis and restoration of autophagy inhibition in Pb-exposed rPT cells. Mechanistically, activation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis triggered by excessive ER stress in rPT cells leads to Pb-induced apoptosis and blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in nephrotoxicity.

Abstract: Drosophila ZIP13 (dZIP13, CG7816/ZIP99C) belongs to the SLC39A family and is connected to iron homeostasis in the fruit fly. In this study, we show that dZIP13 level is strongly regulated by iron. In addition to a mild response to iron at the mRNA level, dZIP13 is strongly regulated at the protein level. This posttranslational regulation by iron also happens when dZIP13 is expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Iron functions to stabilize dZIP13. Domain-swapping experiments between dZIP7 (CG10449/ Catsup) and dZIP13 suggest that the N-terminus of dZIP13 is necessary to mediate this iron regulatory process. Phylogenetic sequence comparison and structural modeling reveal potential iron-binding residues, confirmed by in vitro iron binding assays. Mutations of these potential iron binding sites at the N-terminus, as well as a likely iron binding site at the C-terminus of dZIP13, completely abolish the iron-dependent upregulation in the yeast and the fruit fly. Iron-responsiveness of dZIP13 is consistent with its key role in iron homeostasis. We speculate that this process of dZIP13 regulation, and that of IRE/IRP-controlled ferritin production, work together to better cope with iron repletion in the fly.

Abstract: The NAD-glycohydrolase/ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD38 catalyzes the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to the Ca2+ mobilizing second messengers ADP-ribose (ADPR), 2′-deoxy-ADPR, and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). In the present study, we investigated binding and metabolism of NAD by a soluble fragment of human CD38, sCD38, and its catalytically inactive mutant by monitoring changes in endogenous tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence. Addition of NAD resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in sCD38 fluorescence that is mainly caused by the Trp residue W189. Amplitude of the fluorescence decrease was fitted as one-site binding curve revealing a dissociation constant for NAD of 29 μM. A comparable dissociation constant was found with the catalytically inactive sCD38 mutant (KD 37 μM NAD) indicating that binding of NAD is not significantly affected by the mutation. The NAD-induced decrease in Trp fluorescence completely recovered in case of sCD38. Kinetics of recovery was slowed down with decreasing temperature and sCD38 concentration and increasing NAD concentration demonstrating that recovery in fluorescence is proportional to the enzymatic activity of sCD38. Accordingly, recovery in fluorescence was not observed with the catalytically inactive mutant.

Abstract: Elavl1 (also known as HuR), an RNA binding protein highly conserved between zebrafish and human, regulates gene expression by stabilizing target mRNA. Our previous studies have uncovered that the predominant isoform elavl1a is required for zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis. However, the exact mechanism of how elav11 spatiotemporally stabilizes target mRNAs to regulate specific erythropoiesis is not yet understood. Here we show that phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 by PKC is necessarily required for cytosolic shuttling from the nucleus to stabilize gata1 mRNA and thus promotes erythropoiesis. Knockdown of elavl1a resulted in the hindrance of erythropoiesis and Hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of PKC reproduced the phenotype seen during zebrafish embryogenesis and erythroid differentiation of myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, Hemin induced elavl1a export from nuclear to cytoplasmic space in K562 cells in a manner dependent on phosphorylation on Ser219 and Ser316, as overexpression of elavl1a with mutations on Ser219 and Ser316 resulted in erythropoiesis failure. Additionally, co-administration of low doses of elavl1a morpholino (MO) and three PKC inhibitors showed a combined effect in zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis dysplasia. In conclusion, our study reveals that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 sites controls its nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation in zebrafish, thereby regulating embryonic erythropoiesis.

Abstract: S100 proteins are members of the superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins characterized by the specific Ca2+-binding motif, the EF-hand. Proteins of this superfamily are of clinical use as important diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in adult and pediatric Laboratory Medicine. For example, measurements of troponin are nowadays the ‘gold standard’ in the diagnosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Parvalbumins were identified as major fish allergens and blocking antibodies, induced by immunization with a hypoallergenic parvalbumin mutant, were shown to reduce allergic symptoms. Mutations in calmodulin are linked to inherited ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias. S100 proteins, the largest sub-group within the EF-hand protein family, are closely associated with cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancer, inflammation and autoimmune pathologies and brain diseases. The intention of this review is to focus on the clinical use of S100 proteins as biomarkers and potential drug targets helping to improve the diagnosis of these human diseases in children and adults leading to more selective therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain-containing proteins are a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rab small GTPases and coordinate a plethora of intracellular membrane trafficking events. FAM45A is a non-classical DENN domain protein, whose function was unknown. In this study, we characterized cellular roles of FAM45A. We found that FAM45A localized mainly in late/multivesicular endosomes. Depletion of FAM45A resulted in clustering of endosomes to the perinuclear region. The endocytosis of EGF receptor was impaired in FAM45A knockdown cells due to a delay in the early-to-late endosome transition. Furthermore, the secretion of selected exosome subpopulations was also attenuated in FAM45A knockdown cells. Consistent with these results, Rab27a and Rab27b, two Rabs involved in endosome motility and exosome biogenesis, were found to act downstream of FAM45A pathway. FAM45A colocalized with Rab27a/b and formed complex with them in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Taken together, FAM45A defines a novel regulatory step in the homeostasis of late endocytic pathway, including endosomal positioning, maturation and secretion, possibly through activating Rab proteins such as Rab27a/b.

Abstract: Estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, tamoxifen has been universally used for the treatment of the ER-positive breast cancer; however, the inevitable emergence of resistance to tamoxifen obstructs the successful treatment of this cancer. So, there is an immediate requirement for the search of a novel therapeutic target for treatment of this cancer. Acquired tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (MCF-7/TAM-R) and T47D (T47D/TAM-R) showed higher apoptotic resistance accompanied by induction of pro-survival autophagy compared to their parental cells. Besides, tamoxifen resistance was associated with reduced production of ATP and with overexpression of glycolytic pathways, leading to induced autophagy to meet the energy demand. Further, our study revealed that LDHA; one of the key molecules of glycolysis in association with Beclin-1 induced pro-survival autophagy in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Mechanistically, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of LDHA reduced the pro-survival autophagy, with the restoration of apoptosis and reverting back the EMT like phenomena noticed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. In total, targeting LDHA opened a novel strategy to interrupt autophagy and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.

Abstract: Molecular alterations in cell death pathways and imbalances in regulators of up- or downstream signaling pathways can lead to resistance to cell death, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. These signaling modifications are strategies that tumor cells use to resist chemotherapy and that contribute to the high recurrence rate of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The SET oncoprotein is a PP2A inhibitor that accumulates in HNSCC and represents a promising therapeutic target. Here we report the role that SET protein plays in resistance to death of two HNSCC cell lines: Cal 27 and HN13. SET protein regulated intracellular redox balance by controlling cellular localization of APE 1 – an endonuclease that is part of the SET complex and regulates antioxidant gene transcription. SET protein knockdown (siSET) associated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress sensitized Cal 27 and HN13 cells to apoptosis via the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, respectively. SET protein upregulated autophagy in HNSCC cells in a PP2A-dependent manner and apparently regulated ULK1 expression. The fact that siSET lowered Bcl-2 phosphorylation levels indicated that SET protein interfered with an alternative pathway that modulated autophagy in HNSCC cells. Overall, SET protein regulated intracellular redox state and sustained autophagy in HNSCC cells, which may explain resistance to death of HNSCC cells. Altogether, the findings reported herein support SET protein as therapeutic target for HNSCC.

Abstract: Src is a known proto-oncogene and its aberrant activity is involved in a variety of cancers, including ovarian cancer, whereas the regulatory mechanism of Src has not been fully clarified. In this study, we identified tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) 50 as a novel negative regulator of Src protein. Our data showed that TRIM50 directly interacted with SH3 domain of Src via its B-box domain; and TRIM50 reduced Src stability by inducing RING domain-dependent K48-linked poly-ubiquitous modification. We further demonstrated that TRIM50 acted as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer cells by its negative regulation of Src protein. In vivo animal model verified that TRIM50 inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of ovarian cancer by suppressing Src protein. Clinical investigation showed that expression of TRIM50 in clinical specimens was inversely correlated with the clinical stages, pathology grades and lymph node metastatic status of the patients, which indicated the involvement of aberrant TRIM50 expression in disease progression. Further analysis verified the negative correlation between TRIM50 and Src expression in clinical specimens. Altogether, we identified TRIM50 as a novel suppressor of Src protein, and demonstrated that TRIM50 inhibited ovarian cancer progression by targeting Src and reducing its activity, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for Src over-activated cancers by positive regulation of TRIM50.

Abstract: Spatial and temporal subcellular localization plays critical roles in regulating protein function. Cten (C-terminal tensin like) is a member of the tensin family. Cten recruits signaling molecules, such as DLC1, to focal adhesions, modulates homeostasis of receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR and c-Met, and promotes cell migration. These functions are likely controlled by Cten localization at focal adhesions and/or in the cytoplasm. In addition, Cten has been detected in the nucleus by which mechanism is unknown. To this end, we have examined the distribution of Cten in various cell lines, determined primary sequence requirements for its nuclear and focal adhesion localizations, and analyzed potential roles of nuclear Cten. Our results show that a proportion of Cten translocates to nuclei in cancer cell lines and that nuclear exporting of Cten is a CRM1-dependent process. A nuclear localization sequence and a nuclear export sequence are identified within Cten. In addition, like other tensins, Cten contains two independent focal adhesion binding sites. Although further expression of recombinant Cten showed no effect on cancer cell proliferation, silencing of Cten significantly reduced cell growth. Furthermore, expression of Cten mutants either with defective nuclear export sequence or tagged with SV40 nuclear localization sequence promoted cell growth. These results suggest that nuclear Cten contributes to cancer cell proliferation. Our findings identify a molecular mechanism for regulating Cten protein trafficking in mammalian cells and provide new insights into the dynamics of focal adhesion complexes in health and disease.

Abstract: Cell Penetrating Peptides -CPPs- are short aminoacidic stretches present in proteins that have the ability to translocate the plasma membrane and facilitate delivery of various molecules. They are usually rich in basic residues, and organized as alpha helices. NF-Y is a transcription factor heterotrimer formed by two Histone Fold Domain –HFD- subunits and the sequence-specific NF-YA. NF-YA possesses two α-helices rich in basic residues. We show that it efficiently enters cells at nanomolar concentrations in the absence of carrier peptides. Mutagenesis identified at least two separate CPPs in the A1 and A2, which overlap with previously identified nuclear localization signals (NLS). The half-life of the transduced protein is short in human cancer cells, longer in mouse C2C12 myoblasts. The internalized NF-YA is capable of trimerization with the HFD subunits and binding to the target CCAAT box. Functionality is further suggested by protein transfection in C2C12 cells, leading to inhibition of differentiation to myotubes. In conclusion, NF-YA contains CPPs, hinting at novel -and unexpected- properties of this subunit.

Abstract: Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer cells plays an important role in cancer-immune cell interaction. The emerging evidence suggests regulation of PD-L1 expression by several tumor microenvironmental cues. However, the association of PD-L1 expression with chemical and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment, specifically epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and matrix stiffness, remains elusive. Herein, we determine whether EGFR targeting and substrate stiffness affect the regulation of PD-L1 expression. Breast carcinoma cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were cultured under different conditions targeting EGFR and exposing cells to distinct substrate stiffness to evaluate PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, the ability to form aggregates in short-term culture of breast carcinoma cells and its effect on expression level of PD-L1 was probed. Our results indicated that PD-L1 expression was altered in response to both EGFR inhibition and substrate stiffness. Additionally, a positive association between the formation of multicellular aggregates and PD-L1 expression was observed. MDA-MB-231 cells expressed the highest PD-L1 level on a stiff substrate, while inhibition of EGFR reduced expression of PD-L1. The results suggested that both physical and chemical features of tumor microenvironment regulate PD-L1 expression through alteration of tumor aggregate formation potential. In line with these results, the in-silico study highlighted a positive correlation between PD-L1 expression, EGFR signaling, epithelial to mesenchymal transition related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) and stemness markers in metastatic breast cancer. These findings improve our understanding of regulation of PD-L1 expression by tumor microenvironment leading to evasion of tumor cells from the immune system.

Abstract: Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) was originally isolated as a Fas-associated factor and was subsequently found to interact with numerous other proteins that are involved in various cellular events including Fas-mediated apoptosis, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathways, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated transactivation, and ubiquitin-dependent processes. Herein, we defined two small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-interacting motifs (SIMs) within FAF1 and demonstrated to be crucial for transcriptional modulation of the MR. Our study demonstrated that the SIMs of FAF1 do not play a significant role in regulating its subcellular localization, Fas-mediated apoptosis, or NF-κB or Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Remarkably, FAF1 interacts with the sumoylated MR and represses aldosterone-activated MR transactivation in a SIM-dependent manner. Moreover, silencing of endogenous FAF1 in cells resulted in an increase in the induction of MR target genes by aldosterone, indicating that FAF1 functions as an MR co-repressor. We further provide evidence to suggest that the mechanisms of FAF1/SIM-mediated MR transrepression involve inhibition of MR N/C interactions and promotion of MR polyubiquitination and degradation. Sumoylation has been linked to impacting of repressive properties on several transcription factors and cofactors. Our findings therefore provide mechanistic insights underlying SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression of the MR.

Abstract: It is well established that a family of dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) play key roles in the regulated dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinase isoforms in mammalian cells and tissues. MKPs provide a mechanism of spatiotemporal feedback control of these key signalling pathways, but can also mediate crosstalk between distinct MAP kinase cascades and facilitate interactions between MAP kinase pathways and other key signalling modules. As our knowledge of the regulation, substrate specificity and catalytic mechanisms of MKPs has matured, more recent work using genetic models has revealed key physiological functions for MKPs and also uncovered potentially important roles in regulating the pathophysiological outcome of signalling with relevance to human diseases. These include cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. It is hoped that this understanding will reveal novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for disease, thus contributing to more effective diagnosis and treatment for these debilitating and often fatal conditions.

Abstract: In resting cells, the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is stabilized by complexation with the cytoplasmic inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα). Extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide activate NF-κB through IκBα phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Herein, we developed a novel biosensor, by fusing the monomeric fluorescent protein Kusabira-Orange 2 to IκBα (mKO2-IκBα), to study the dynamics and structure-activity relationship of IκBα degradation. Site-specific deletion studies on the IκBα sequence revealed that the C-terminal PEST domain is required in signal-induced proteasomal degradation of IκBα and functions independently from ankyrin repeats. Using deletion mutants, we show that IκBα ankyrin repeats do not affect IκBα degradability but affect its degradation rate. We demonstrate, by both real-time confocal microscopy and western blot analysis, that the half-life of mKO2-IκBα in response to TNFα is approximately 35 min, which is similar to the half-life of endogenous IκBα. Using this biosensor we also show that selective proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin and MG132, inhibit degradation and affect the kinetics of IκBα in a dose-dependent manner. The techniques described here can have a range of possible applications, such as facilitating studies associated with IκBα dynamics and biochemical characteristics, as well as the screening of potential proteasome inhibitors.

Abstract: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G protein-coupled receptor for trypsin, contributes to growth, anti-apoptosis, and migration in lung cancer. Given that PAR2 activation in airway epithelial cells compromises the airway epithelium barrier by disruption of E-cadherin adhesion, PAR2 may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Although PAR2 is known to promote the migration of lung cancer cells, the detailed mechanism of this event is still not clear. Here, we found that PAR2 is highly expressed in several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299 cells, activation of PAR2 induces migration and Slug-mediated EMT. The underlying mechanisms involved in PAR2-induced migration and EMT in CL1-5 cells were further investigated. We showed that PAR2-induced migration of CL1-5 cells is mediated by the Src/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway. β-arrestin 1, not G protein, is involved in this PAR2-mediated Src/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. PAR2-induced EMT in CL1-5 cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). The activation of ERK2 further mediates Slug stabilization through suppressing the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, a poor prognosis was observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients with a high expression of PAR2. Thus, PAR2 regulates migration through β-arrestin 1-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and EMT through ERK2-mediated stabilization of Slug in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our finding also suggests that PAR2 might serve as a therapeutic target for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Multicellular Tumor Spheroids culture (MCTS) is an in vitro model mimicking the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and acidosis, resulting in the presence of both proliferating and quiescent cell populations. lncRNA's is a novel group of regulatory molecules that participates in the acquisition of tumorigenic phenotypes. In the present work we evaluated the oncogenic association of an uncharacterized lncRNA (lncRNA-HAL) in the tumorigenic phenotype induced by the MCTS microenvironment. We measured lncRNA-HAL expression level in MCF-7-MCTS populations and under different hypoxic conditions by RT-qPCR. Afterwards, we silenced lncRNA-HAL expression by shRNAs and evaluated its effect in MCF-7 transcriptome (by RNAseq) and validated the modified cellular processes by proliferation, migration, and stem cells assays. Finally, we analyzed which proteins interacts with lncRNA-HAL by ChIRP assay, to propose a possible molecular mechanism for this lncRNA. We found that lncRNA-HAL is overexpressed in the internal quiescent populations (p27 positive populations) of MCF-7-MCTS, mainly in the quiescent stem cell population, being hypoxia one of the microenvironmental cues responsible of its overexpression. Transcriptome analysis of lncRNA-HAL knockdown MCF7 cells revealed that lncRNA-HAL effect is associated with proliferation, migration and cell survival mechanisms; moreover, lncRNA-HAL silencing increased cell proliferation and impaired cancer stem cell proportion and function, resulting in decreased tumor grafting in vivo. In addition, we found that this lncRNA was overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Analysis by ChIRP assay showed that this nuclear lncRNA binds to histones and hnRNPs suggesting a participation at the chromatin level and transcriptional regulation. The results obtained in the present work suggest that the function of lncRNA-HAL is associated with quiescent stem cell populations, which in turn is relevant due to its implications in cancer cell survival and resistance against treatment in vivo. Altogether, our data highlights a new lncRNA whose expression is regulated by the tumor microenvironment and associated to stemness in breast cancer.

Abstract: WDR54 is a member of the WD40 repeat (WDR) domain-containing protein family that was recently identified as a novel oncogene in colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of WDR54 and its functional association with other molecules related to tumor cell growth are unknown. Here, we show that WDR54 can be cross-linked by the action of transglutaminase (TG) 2, which enhances the activation of EGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway. The most carboxyl-terminal WD domain was required for cross-linking. In addition, lysine 280 in WDR54, also in this WD domain, was an important residue for both cross-linking and ubiquitination. Cross-linked WDR54 was found in vesicles aggregated at the plasma membrane. The activated EGF receptor was co-localized with this vesicle, and the internalization of the EGF receptor into the cytosol was sustained. As a result, Erk activity in response to EGF stimulation was enhanced. Furthermore, the growth of the cells lacking WDR54 expression generated by genome editing was delayed compared with that in wild-type cells. Because TG2 is also has been proposed to activate the EGF receptor-signaling and proliferation of tumor cells, WDR54 might have a functional relationship with the EGF receptor and TG2. Our study on the mechanism of biological function of WDR54 may provide rationale for the design and development of a cancer drug based on inhibiting the post-translational modification of this oncogene product.

Abstract: Integrins are cell receptors that mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulate cell migration, a crucial process in tumor invasion. The αvβ3 integrin recognizes the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif in ECM proteins and it can be antagonized by RGD-peptides, resulting in decreased cell migration and invasion. RGD-based drugs have shown disappointing results in clinical trials; however, the reasons for their lack of activity are still obscure. Aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the molecular consequences of integrin inhibition, we tested a recombinant RGD-disintegrin (DisBa-01) in two types of murine cell lines, breast tumor 4T1BM2 cells and L929 fibroblasts. Only tumor cells showed decreased motility and adhesion, as well as morphologic alterations upon DisBa-01 treatment (100 and 1000 nM). This result was attributed to the higher levels of αvβ3 integrin in 4T1BM2 cells compared to L929 fibroblasts making the former more sensitive to DisBa-01 blocking. DisBa-01 induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in 4T1BM2 cells, but it did not induce apoptosis, which was consistent with the decrease in caspase-3, 8 and 9 expression at mRNA and protein levels. DisBa-01 increases PI3K, Beclin-1 and LC3B expression in tumor cells, indicators of autophagic induction. In conclusion, αvβ3 integrin blocking by DisBa-01 results in inhibition of adhesion and migration and in the activation of an autophagy program, allowing prolonged survival and avoiding immediate apoptotic death. These observations suggest new insights into the effects of RGD-based inhibitors considering their importance in drug development for human health.

Abstract: Using electron and fluorescence microscopy techniques, we identified various physical contacts between peroxisomes and other cell organelles in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. In exponential glucose-grown cells, which typically contain a single small peroxisome, contacts were only observed with the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. Here we focus on a novel peroxisome-vacuole contact site that is formed when glucose-grown cells are shifted to methanol containing media, conditions that induce strong peroxisome development. At these conditions, the small peroxisomes rapidly increase in size, a phenomenon that is paralleled by the formation of distinct intimate contacts with the vacuole. Localization studies showed that the peroxin Pex3 accumulated in patches at the peroxisome-vacuole contact sites. In wild-type cells growing exponentially on medium containing glucose, peroxisome-vacuole contact sites were never observed. However, upon overproduction of Pex3 peroxisomes also associated to vacuoles at these growth conditions. Our observations strongly suggest a role for Pex3 in the formation of a novel peroxisome-vacuole contact site. This contact likely plays a role in membrane growth as it is formed solely at conditions of strong peroxisome expansion.

Abstract: The efficacy of the very low frequency electromagnetic field in cancer treatment remains elusive due to a lack of explanatory mechanisms for its effect. We developed a novel thermodynamic model that calculates for every cell type the frequency capable of inhibiting proliferation. When this frequency was applied to two human cancer cell lines, it reduced their growth while not affecting healthy cells. The effect was abolished by the inhibition of calcium fluxes. We found evidences of an enhanced respiratory activity due to the increased expression of the elements of the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation, both at the mRNA and protein level. The respiratory burst potentiated the production of reactive oxygen species but was not associated to increased levels of ATP, leading to the conclusion that the energy was readily spent in the adaptive response to the electromagnetic field. Taken together, our data demonstrate that, regardless of individual molecular defects, it is possible to control cancer cells with a specific irradiation that imposes a mitochondrial metabolic switch, regulating calcium fluxes and deleterious to cancer growth. This approach lays the foundations for a personalized cancer medicine.

Abstract: GM2-gangliosidosis, a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase activity, and comprises the closely related Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. The enzyme deficiency prevents normal metabolization of ganglioside GM2, usually resulting in progressive neurodegenerative disease. The molecular mechanisms whereby GM2 accumulation in neurons triggers neurodegeneration remain unclear. In vitro experiments, using microsomes from Sandhoff mouse model brain, showed that increase of GM2 content negatively modulates sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (Pelled et al., 2003). Furthermore, Ca2+ depletion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which tends to restore homeostasis in the ER; however, if cellular damage persists, an apoptotic response is initiated. We found that ER GM2 accumulation in cultured neurons induces luminal Ca2+ depletion, which in turn activates PERK (protein kinase RNA [PKR]-like ER kinase), one of three UPR sensors. PERK signaling displayed biphasic activation; i.e., early upregulation of cytoprotective calcineurin (CN) and, under prolonged ER stress, enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, GM2 accumulation in neuronal cells induced neurite atrophy and apoptosis. Both processes were effectively modulated by treatment with the selective PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, by CN knockdown, and by CHOP knockdown. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of PERK signaling pathway contributing to neurodegeneration in a model of GM2-gangliosidosis.

Abstract: Tumor protein D52 (TPD52) is overexpressed in multiple cancers including prostate cancer due to gene amplification and investigations to understand its role in the pathophysiology of different cancers are continuing. GST pull-down assays and Tandem affinity purification of TPD52 as bait identified novel prey Peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. PRDX1 interaction with TPD52 was confirmed in immunoprecipitation and affinity interaction assays. Mapping of interaction domain indicated that PRDX1 interacts with C-terminal region of TPD52 containing PEST domain between 152 and 179 amino acids, a new binding region of TPD52. Here we show that TPD52 interaction with PRDX1 increased its peroxidase activity and ectopic expression of TPD52 induced dimerization of PRDX1 in PCa cells. Moreover, H2O2 exposure evoked the interaction between TPD52 and PRDX1 while depletion of both proteins led to the accumulation of H2O2 suggesting peroxidase activity is important to maintain oxidative capacity in PCa cells. We also observed that overexpression or downregulation of TPD52 and PRDX1 individually or together affecting PCa cells growth, survival, and migration. Altogether, our results show a novel interaction partner of TPD52 providing new insights of its functions and ascertain the role of TPD52-PRDX1 interaction in PCa progression.

Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and a poor prognosis. The invasive ability of TNBC relies on actin reorganization and is regulated by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). The present study aimed to examine the effect of MPT0G211, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, on cell migration and microtubule association in both in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC. Here MPT0G211 more selectively and potently targeted and inhibited HDAC6, compared with tubastatin A, another selective HDAC6 inhibitor. In vitro, MPT0G211 decreased the migration of the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, particularly when administered together with paclitaxel, and increased heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) acetylation, leading to the dissociation of Hsp90 from aurora-A and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, MPT0G211 significantly disrupted F-actin polymerization by increasing cortactin acetylation and downregulating slingshot protein phosphatase 1 (SSH1) and active cofilin expression. In vivo, MPT0G211 treatment significantly ameliorated TNBC metastasis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MPT0G211 reduces TNBC cell motility by promoting cortactin acetylation and aurora-A degradation, and inhibiting the cofilin–F-actin pathway via HDAC6 activity attenuation. MPT0G211 therefore demonstrates therapeutic potential for invasive TNBC.

LDL receptor related protein 1 requires the I3 domain of discs-large homolog 1/DLG1 for interaction with the kinesin motor protein KIF13B,

Abstract: KIF13B, a kinesin-3 family motor, was originally identified as GAKIN due to its biochemical interaction with human homolog of Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor (hDLG1). Unlike its homolog KIF13A, KIF13B contains a carboxyl-terminal CAP-Gly domain. To investigate the function of the CAP-Gly domain, we developed a mouse model that expresses a truncated form of KIF13B protein lacking its CAP-Gly domain (KIF13BΔCG), whereas a second mouse model lacks the full-length KIF13A. Here we show that the KIF13BΔCG mice exhibit relatively higher serum cholesterol consistent with the reduced uptake of [3H]CO-LDL in KIF13BΔCG mouse embryo fibroblasts. The plasma level of factor VIII was not significantly elevated in the KIF13BΔCG mice, suggesting that the CAP-Gly domain region of KIF13B selectively regulates LRP1-mediated lipoprotein endocytosis. No elevation of either serum cholesterol or plasma factor VIII was observed in the full length KIF13A null mouse model. The deletion of the CAP-Gly domain region caused subcellular mislocalization of truncated KIF13B concomitant with the mislocalization of LRP1. Mechanistically, the cytoplasmic domain of LRP1 interacts specifically with the alternatively spliced I3 domain of DLG1, which complexes with KIF13B via their GUK-MBS domains, respectively. Importantly, double mutant mice generated by crossing KIF13A null and KIF13BΔCG mice suffer from perinatal lethality showing potential craniofacial defects. Together, this study provides first evidence that the carboxyl-terminal region of KIF13B containing the CAP-Gly domain is important for the LRP1-DLG1-KIF13B complex formation with implications in the regulation of metabolism, cell polarity, and development.

Abstract: The Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor Kappa B Kinase Subunit Epsilon (IKKε) is an oncogenic protein that is up-regulated in various types of human cancers, including breast tumors. This kinase regulates diverse processes associated with malignant progression including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. To delve into the molecular mechanisms regulated by this kinase we performed RNA-seq and network analysis of breast cancer cells overexpressing IKKε. We found that the TNF/NF-κB cascade was clearly enriched, and in accordance, NF-κB pathway inhibition in these cells resulted in a decreased expression of IKKε target genes. Interestingly, we also found an enrichment of a mammary stemness functional pathway. Upregulation of IKKε led to an increase of a stem CD44+/CD24−/low population accompanied by a high expression of stem markers such as ALDH1A3, NANOG, and KLF4 and with an increased clonogenic ability and mammosphere formation capacity. These results were corroborated with in vivo dilution assays in zebrafish embryos which showed a significant increase in the number of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Finally, we found that Triple-Negative breast tumors, which are enriched in CSCs, display higher levels of IKKε than other breast tumors, supporting the association of this kinase with the stem phenotype. In conclusion, our results highlight the role of IKKε kinase in the regulation of the stem cell phenotype in breast cancer cells, as assessed by expression, functional and in vivo assays. These results add to the potential use of this kinase as a therapeutic target in this neoplasia.

Abstract: Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are specialized secretory organelles of endothelial cells that serve important functions in the response to inflammation and vascular injury. WPBs actively respond to different stimuli by regulated exocytosis leading to full or selective release of their contents. Cellular conditions and mechanisms that distinguish between these possibilities are only beginning to emerge. To address this we analyzed dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton during histamine-stimulated, Ca2+-dependent WPB exocytosis. We show that most WPB fusion events are followed by a rapid release of von-Willebrand factor (VWF), the large WPB cargo, and that this occurs concomitant with a softening of the actin cortex by the recently described Ca2+-dependent actin reset (CaAR). However, a considerable fraction of WPB fusion events is characterized by a delayed release of VWF and observed after the CaAR reaction peak. These delayed VWF secretions are accompanied by an assembly of actin rings or coats around the WPB post-fusion structures and are also seen following direct elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by plasma membrane wounding. Actin ring/coat assembly at WPB post-fusion structures requires Rho GTPase activity and is significantly reduced upon expression of a dominant-active mutant of the formin INF2 that triggers a permanent CaAR peak-like sequestration of actin to the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings suggest that a rigid actin cortex correlates with a higher proportion of fused WPB which assemble actin rings/coats most likely required for efficient VWF expulsion and/or stabilization of a WPB post-fusion structure.

Abstract: Activation and repression of Notch target genes is mediated by transcription factor CSL, known as Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) in Drosophila and CBF1 or RBPJ in human. CSL associates either with co-activator Notch or with co-repressors such as Drosophila Hairless. The nuclear translocation of transcription factor CSL relies on co-factor association, both in mammals and in Drosophila. The Drosophila CSL orthologue Su(H) requires Hairless for repressor complex formation. Based on its role in transcriptional silencing, H protein would be expected to be strictly nuclear. However, H protein is also cytosolic, which may relate to its role in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Su(H) protein. Here, we investigate the function of the predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS 1–3) and single nuclear export signal (NES) of co-repressor Hairless using GFP-fusion proteins, reporter assays and in vivo analyses using Hairless wild type and shuttling-defective Hairless mutants. We identify NLS3 and NES to be critical for Hairless function. In fact, H⁎NLS3 mutant flies match H null mutants, whereas H⁎NLS3⁎NES double mutants display weaker phenotypes in agreement with a crucial role for NES in H export. As expected for a transcriptional repressor, Notch target genes are deregulated in H⁎NLS3 mutant cells, demonstrating nuclear requirement for its activity. Importantly, we reveal that Su(H) protein strictly follows Hairless protein localization. Together, we propose that shuttling between the nucleo-cytoplasmic compartments provides the possibility to fine tune the regulation of Notch target gene expression by balancing of Su(H) protein availability for Notch activation.

Abstract: Na+/H+ antiporters are involved in ensuring optimal intracellular concentrations of alkali-metal cations and protons in most organisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the plasma-membrane Na+, K+/H+ antiporter Nha1 mediates Na+ and K+ efflux, which is important for cell growth in the presence of salts. Nha1 belongs among housekeeping proteins and, due to its ability to export K+, it has many physiological functions. The Nha1 transport activity is regulated through its long, hydrophilic and unstructured C-terminus (554 of 985 aa). Although Nha1 has been previously shown to interact with the yeast 14-3-3 isoform (Bmh2), the binding site remains unknown. In this work, we identified the residues through which Nha1 interacts with the 14-3-3 protein. Biophysical characterization of the interaction between the C-terminal polypeptide of Nha1 and Bmh proteins in vitro revealed that the 14-3-3 protein binds to phosphorylated Ser481 of Nha1, and the crystal structure of the phosphopeptide containing Ser481 bound to Bmh1 provided the structural basis of this interaction. Our data indicate that 14-3-3 binding induces a disorder-to-order transition of the C-terminus of Nha1, and in vivo experiments showed that the mutation of Ser481 to Ala significantly increases cation efflux activity via Nha1, which renders cells sensitive to low K+ concentrations. Hence, 14-3-3 binding is apparently essential for the negative regulation of Nha1 activity, which should be low under standard growth conditions, when low amounts of toxic salts are present and yeast cells need to accumulate high amounts of K+.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates three principal signaling pathways, collectively known as the unfolded protein response, leading to translational and transcriptional control mechanisms that dictate the cell's response as adaptive or apoptotic. The present study illustrates that for HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells the signaling pathways triggered by ER stress extend beyond the three principal pathways to include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, leading to activation of transcription from the early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene. Analysis provided evidence for a SRC-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade mechanism that leads to enhanced phosphorylation of the transcription factor ELK1. ELK1 and serum response factor (SRF) are constitutively bound to the EGR1 promoter and are phosphorylated by nuclear localized ERK. The promoter abundance of both phospho-SRF and phopsho-ELK1 was increased by ER stress, but the SRF phosphorylation was transient. Knockdown of ELK1 had little effect on the basal EGR1 mRNA content, but completely blocked the increase in response to ER stress. Conversely, knockdown of SRF suppressed basal EGR1 mRNA content, but had only a small effect on the induction by ER stress. This research highlights the importance of MAPK signaling in response to ER stress and identifies ELK1 as a transcriptional mediator and the EGR1 gene as a target.

Abstract: Cargo receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) recognize and help membrane and soluble proteins along the secretory pathway to reach their location and functional site. We characterized physiological properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking the ERV14 gene, which encodes a cargo receptor part of COPII-coated vesicles that cycles between the ER and Golgi membranes. The lack of Erv14 resulted in larger cell volume, plasma-membrane hyperpolarization, and intracellular pH decrease. Cells lacking ERV14 exhibited increased sensitivity to toxic cationic drugs and decreased ability to grow on low K+. We found no change in the localization of plasma membrane H+-ATPase Pma1, Na+, K+-ATPase Ena1 and K+ importer Trk2 or vacuolar K+-Cl− co-transporter Vhc1 in the absence of Erv14. However, Erv14 influenced the targeting of two K+-specific plasma-membrane transport systems, Tok1 (K+ channel) and Trk1 (K+ importer), that were retained in the ER in erv14Δ cells. The lack of Erv14 resulted in growth phenotypes related to a diminished amount of Trk1 and Tok1 proteins. We confirmed that Rb+ whole-cell uptake via Trk1 is not efficient in cells lacking Erv14. ScErv14 helped to target Trk1 homologues from other yeast species to the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane. The direct interaction between Erv14 and Tok1 or Trk1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and by a mating-based Split Ubiquitin System. In summary, our results identify Tok1 and Trk1 to be new cargoes for Erv14 and show this receptor to be an important player participating in the maintenance of several physiological parameters of yeast cells.

Abstract: Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) is an NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylase that regulates diverse biological processes. We recently observed that SIRT7 deficiency suppresses the nuclear accumulation of p65, which is a component of nuclear factor kappa B. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that SIRT7 interacts with a small GTPase, Ras-related nuclear antigen (Ran), and deacetylates Ran at K37. The nuclear export of p65 was facilitated in SIRT7-deficient fibroblast cells, while the nuclear export was inhibited in SIRT7-deficient cells expressing K37R-Ran (deacetylation-mimicking mutant). Additionally, the nuclear export of p65 in wild-type fibroblast cells was promoted by K37Q-Ran (acetylation-mimicking mutant). K37Q-Ran exhibited an increased ability to bind to chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is a major nuclear receptor that mediates the export of cargo proteins, and enhanced the binding between p65 and CRM1. These data suggest that SIRT7 is a lysine deacetylase that targets the K37 residue of Ran to suppress the nuclear export of p65.

Abstract: Overcoming apoptosis resistance is one major issue in glioblastoma (GB) therapies. Accumulating evidence indicates that resistance to apoptosis in GB is mediated via upregulation of pro-survival BCL2-family members. The synthetic BH3-mimetic ABT-737 effectively targets BCL2, BCL2 like 1 and BCL2 like 2 but still barely affects cell survival which is presumably due to its inability to inhibit myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). The constitutively active serine/threonine kinase proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) was recently found to be overexpressed in GB patient samples and to maintain cell survival in these tumors. For different GB cell lines, Western Blot, mitochondrial fractionation, fluorescence microscopy, effector caspase assays, flow cytometry, and an adult organotypic brain slice transplantation model were used to investigate the putative PIM1/MCL1 signaling axis regarding potential synergistic effects with ABT-737. We demonstrate that combination of the PIM1 inhibitor SGI-1776 or the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 with ABT-737 strongly sensitizes GB cells to apoptosis. Unexpectedly, this effect was found to be MCL1-independent, but could be partially blocked by caspase 8 (CASP8) inhibition. Remarkably, the analysis of autophagy markers in combination with the observation of massive accumulation and hampered degradation of autophagosomes suggests a completely novel function of PIM1 as a late stage autophagy regulator, maintaining the autophagic flux at the level of autophagosome/lysosome fusion. Our data indicate that PIM1 inhibition and ABT-737 synergistically induce apoptosis in an MCL1-independent but CASP8-dependent manner in GB. They also identify PIM1 as a suitable target for overcoming apoptosis resistance in GB.

Abstract: BAG3 is a member of the cochaperone BAG family and often highly expressed in various cancers. Recently, evidences show that BAG3 promotes stemness of human cancer cells. IFN-stimulated genes 15 (ISG15) is an ubiquitin-like molecule, which is covalently conjugated with substrates to form ISGylated proteins. Global screening BAG3 interacting partners demonstrated that ISG15 might be a potential binding partner. The current study revealed that BAG3 did not interact with ISG15, but positively regulated ISG15 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC). It was further found that BAG3 deletion stabilized ISG15 mRNAs, while suppressed its translation via increasing Serine phosphorylation of Ago2 at position 387 (S387). Both BAG3 deletion and ISG15 knockdown suppressed stem cell-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, including clonogenicity, invasiveness and spheroid formation. In addition, ectopic ISG15 expression rescued the suppressive role of BAG3 deletion in cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes of PDAC cells, and this effect of ISG15 was independent of its ISGylation function. The current study implies that BAG3 and ISG15 may provide a therapeutic advantage for PDAC.

Abstract: Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate is an evolutionarily conserved second messenger, which mobilizes Ca2+ from acidic stores. The molecular identity of the NAADP receptor has yet to be defined. In pursuit of isolating and identifying NAADP-binding proteins, we synthesized and characterized a bifunctional probe that incorporates both a photoactivatable crosslinking azido moiety at the 5-position of the nicotinic ring and a ‘clickable’ ethynyl moiety to the 8-adenosyl position in NAADP. Microinjection of this 5N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP into cultured U2OS cells induced robust Ca2+ responses. Higher concentrations of 5N3-8-ethynyl were required to elicit Ca2+ release or displace 32P-NAADP in radioligand binding experiments in sea urchin egg homogenates. In human cell extracts, incubation of 32P-5N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP followed by UV irradiation resulted in selective labeling of 23 kDa and 35 kDa proteins and photolabeling of these proteins was prevented when incubated in the presence of unlabeled NAADP. Compared to the monofunctional 32P-5N3-NAADP, the clickable 32P-5N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP demonstrated less labeling of the 23 kDa and 35 kDa proteins (~3-fold) but provided an opportunity for further enrichment through the ‘clickable’ ethynyl moiety. No proteins were specifically labeled by 32P-5N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP in sea urchin egg homogenate. These experiments demonstrate that 5N3-8-ethynyl-NAADP is biologically active and selectively labels putative NAADP-binding proteins in mammalian systems, evidencing a ‘bifunctional’ probe with utility for isolating NAADP-binding proteins.

Abstract: The ability to regenerate the entire retina and restore lost sight after injury is found in some species and relies mostly on the epigenetic plasticity of Müller glia. To understand the role of mammalian Müller glia as a source of progenitors for retinal regeneration, we investigated changes in gene expression during differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into Müller glia and analyzed the global epigenetic profile of adult Müller glia. We observed significant changes in gene expression during differentiation of RPCs into Müller glia in only a small group of genes and found a high similarity between RPCs and Müller glia on the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. Our findings also indicate that Müller glia are epigenetically very close to late-born retinal neurons, but not early-born retinal neurons. Importantly, we found that key genes required for phototransduction were highly methylated. Thus, our data suggest that Müller glia are epigenetically very similar to late RPCs; however, obstacles for regeneration of the entire mammalian retina from Müller glia may consist of repressive chromatin and highly methylated DNA in the promoter regions of many genes required for the development of early-born retinal neurons. In addition, DNA demethylation may be required for proper reprogramming and differentiation of Müller glia into rod photoreceptors.

Abstract: In spite of its basic and applied interest, the regulation of ER exit by filamentous fungi is insufficiently understood. In previous work we isolated a panel of conditional mutations in sarA encoding the master GTPase SarASAR1 in A. nidulans and demonstrated its key role in exocytosis and hyphal morphogenesis. However, the SAR1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Sec12, has not been characterized in any filamentous fungus, largely due to the fact that SEC12 homologues share little amino acid sequence identity beyond a GGGGxxxxGϕxN motif involved in guanine nucleotide exchange. Here we demonstrate that AN11127 encodes A. nidulans Sec12, which is an essential protein that localizes to the ER and that, when overexpressed, rescues the growth defect resulting from a hypomorphic sarA6ts mutation at 37 °C. Using purified, bacterially expressed proteins we demonstrate that the product of AN11127 accelerates nucleotide exchange on SarASAR1, but not on its closely related GTPase ArfAARF1, as expected for a bona fide GEF. The unequivocal characterization of A. nidulans Sec12 paves the way for the tailored modification of ER exit in a model organism that is closely related to industrial species of filamentous fungi.

Abstract: Intact store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mechanisms ensure the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes while their dysregulation promotes the development of cardiomyopathies. To better understand this calcium handling process in cardiomyocytes, we sought to identify unknown protein partners of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a main regulatory protein of SOCE. We identified the muscle-related coiled-coil protein (MURC), also known as Cavin-4, as a candidate and showed that MURC interacts with STIM1 in cardiomyocytes. This interaction occurs via the HR1 and ERM domains of MURC and STIM1, respectively. Our results also demonstrated that the overexpression of MURC in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) is sufficient to potentiate SOCE and that its HR1 domain is required to mediate this effect. Interestingly, the R140W-MURC mutant, a missense variant of the HR1 domain associated with human dilated cardiomyopathy, exacerbates the SOCE increase in NRVM. Although the endogenous expression of STIM1 and Ca2+ channel Orai1 is not modulated under these conditions, we showed that MURC increases the interaction between these proteins under resting conditions. Our study provides novel evidence that MURC regulates SOCE by interacting with STIM1 in cardiomyocytes. In addition, we identified a first potential mechanism by which the R140W mutation of MURC may contribute to calcium mishandling and the development of cardiomyopathies.

Abstract: Peroxisomal biogenesis factor PEX26 is a membrane anchor for the multi-subunit PEX1-PEX6 protein complex that controls ubiquitination and dislocation of PEX5 cargo receptors for peroxisomal matrix protein import. PEX26 associates with the peroxisomal translocation pore via PEX14 and a splice variant (PEX26Δex5) of unknown function has been reported. Here, we demonstrate PEX26 homooligomerization mediated by two heptad repeat domains adjacent to the transmembrane domain. We show that isoform-specific domain organization determines PEX26 oligomerization and impacts peroxisomal β-oxidation and proliferation. PEX26 and PEX26Δex5 displayed different patterns of interaction with PEX2-PEX10 or PEX13-PEX14 complexes, which relate to distinct pre-peroxisomes in the de novo synthesis pathway. Our data support an alternative PEX14-dependent mechanism of peroxisomal membrane association for the splice variant, which lacks a transmembrane domain. Structure-function relationships of PEX26 isoforms explain an extended function in peroxisomal homeostasis and these findings may improve our understanding of the broad phenotype of PEX26-associated human disorders.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease, posing a severe threat to public health. Previous studies reported the protective role of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in DN, encouraging the investigation of more potent and specific SIRT1 activators. SRT2104 is a novel, first-in-class, highly selective small-molecule activator of SIRT1, with its effect and mechanism unknown on DN. To this end, streptozotocin-induced C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) diabetic mice were treated with SRT2104, for 24 weeks. To determine whether SRT2104 acted through inhibition of P53 – a substrate of SIRT1, the P53 activator nutlin3a was administered to the WT diabetic mice in the presence of SRT2104. In order to test whether nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) – the master of cellular antioxidants – mediated SIRT1 and P53's actions, WT and Nrf2 gene knockout (KO) diabetic mice were treated with SRT2104 or the P53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (PFT-α). In the WT mice, SRT2104 enhanced renal SIRT1 expression and activity, deacetylated P53, and activated NRF2 antioxidant signaling, providing remarkable protection against the DM-induced renal oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, glomerular remodeling and albuminuria. These effects were completely abolished in the presence of nutlin3a. Deletion of the Nrf2 gene completely abrogated the efficacies of SRT2104 and PFT-α in elevating antioxidants and ameliorating DN, despite their abilities to activate SIRT1 and inhibit P53 in the Nrf2 KO mice. The present study reports the beneficial effects of SRT2104 on DN, uncovering a SIRT1/P53/NRF2 pathway that modulates the pathogenesis of DN.

Abstract: Extracellular amino acid (AA) withdrawal/restriction invokes an integrated stress response (ISR) that induces global suppression of protein synthesis whilst allowing transcription and translation of a select group of genes, whose protein products facilitate cellular adaptation to AA insufficiency. Transcriptional induction of the System A/SNAT2 AA transporter represents a classic adaptation response and crucially depends upon activation of the General Control Nonderepressible-2 kinase/Activating transcription factor 4 (GCN2/ATF4) pathway. However, the ISR may also include additional signalling inputs operating in conjunction or independently of GCN2/ATF4 to upregulate SNAT2. Herein, we show that whilst pharmacological inhibition of MEK-ERK, mTORC1 and p38 MAP kinase signalling has no detectable effect on System A upregulation, inhibitors targeting GSK3 (e.g. SB415286) caused significant repression of the SNAT2 adaptation response. Strikingly, the effects of SB415286 persist in cells in which GSK3α/β have been stably silenced indicating an off-target effect. We show that SB415286 can also inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and that roscovitine and flavopiridol (two pan CDK inhibitors) are effective repressors of the SNAT2 adaptive response. In particular, our work reveals that CDK7 activity is upregulated in AA-deprived cells in a GCN-2-dependent manner and that a potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor, THZ-1, not only attenuates the increase in ATF4 expression but blocks System A adaptation. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of THZ-1 on System A adaptation are mitigated in cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible drug-resistant form of CDK7. Our data identify CDK7 as a novel component of the ISR regulating System A adaptation in response to AA insufficiency.

Abstract: CPSF4 was identified as a crucial tumorigenic factor in lung cancer development. However, its precise function and the underlying molecular mechanisms in colon cancer progression remain completely unknown. Here, we demonstrate CPSF4 was highly expressed in human colon cancer cells and tissues. Its knockdown inhibited colorectal cancer progression in vitro, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness maintenance. In contrast, the ectopic overexpression of CPSF4 had the opposite effects in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that CPSF4 facilitated colorectal tumorigenesis and development partially through transcriptionally regulating hTERT expression by cooperating with NF-kB1 and co-anchoring at hTERT promoter −321 to −234 fragment. In addition, clinical samples analysis indicated that CPSF4 expression was positively correlated with hTERT, and the simultaneously high expression of CPSF4 and hTERT predicted poor patient outcome. Overall, our findings established CPSF4 as a pro-tumorigenic factor in colorectal cancer progression, and suggested that targeting CPSF4-hTERT axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in colon cancer treatment.

Abstract: Chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) initiated by the cochaperone Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) represents an important mechanism for the disposal of misfolded and damaged proteins in mammalian cells. Under mechanical stress, the cochaperone cooperates with the small heat shock protein HSPB8 and the cytoskeleton-associated protein SYNPO2 to degrade force-unfolded forms of the actin-crosslinking protein filamin. This is essential for muscle maintenance in flies, fish, mice and men. Here, we identify the serine/threonine protein kinase 38 (STK38), which is part of the Hippo signaling network, as a novel interactor of BAG3. STK38 was previously shown to facilitate cytoskeleton assembly and to promote mitophagy as well as starvation and detachment induced autophagy. Significantly, our study reveals that STK38 exerts an inhibitory activity on BAG3-mediated autophagy. Inhibition relies on a disruption of the functional interplay of BAG3 with HSPB8 and SYNPO2 upon binding of STK38 to the cochaperone. Of note, STK38 attenuates CASA independently of its kinase activity, whereas previously established regulatory functions of STK38 involve target phosphorylation. The ability to exert different modes of regulation on central protein homeostasis (proteostasis) machineries apparently allows STK38 to coordinate the execution of diverse macroautophagy pathways and to balance cytoskeleton assembly and degradation.

Abstract: Phoenixin (PNX) is a recently discovered neuropeptide which modulates appetite, pain sensation and neurons of the reproductive system in the central nervous system. PNX is also detectable in the circulation and in peripheral tissues. Recent data suggested that PNX blood levels positively correlate with body weight as well as nutritional status suggesting a potential role of this peptide in controlling energy homeostasis. PNX is detectable in endocrine pancreas, however it is unknown whether PNX regulates insulin biosynthesis or secretion. Using insulin producing INS-1E cells and isolated rat pancreatic islets we evaluated therefore, whether PNX controls insulin expression, secretion and cell proliferation. We identified PNX in pancreatic alpha as well as in beta cells. Secretion of PNX from pancreatic islets was stimulated by high glucose. PNX stimulated insulin mRNA expression in INS-1E cells. Furthermore, PNX enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1E cells and pancreatic islets in a time-dependent manner. Stimulation of insulin secretion by PNX was dependent upon cAMP/Epac signalling, while potentiation of cell growth and insulin mRNA expression was mediated via ERK1/2- and AKT-pathway. These results indicate that PNX may play a role in controlling glycemia by interacting with pancreatic beta cells.

Abstract: Several human acute and chronic diseases involve calpain over-activation. However, the mechanistic linkages between the etiology and the progression of cell damages are not yet completely understood. Here we show that different human cells and tissues, including brain tumor specimens, cell lines of nerve origin, breast tumor samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, express a calpastatin form that lacks all the exons coding for the domains responsible of calpain inhibition. The open reading frame of this new form of calpastatin, named hcast 3-25, starts inside the L-domain (exons 2 and 3) and continues with the exons from 25 to 29 that code for the conserved C-terminal tail shared by all the full-length calpastatins. We have here observed that unlike the other calpastatins forms, that are predominantly Δ3 splice variants, hcast 3-25 is endowed with exon 3. At a functional level, recombinant hcast 3-25 operates as a positive modulator of calpain-1 in vitro by preventing 1) calpain-1-mediated proteolytic degradation of the activated enzyme and 2) binding to calpain-1 of inhibitory calpastatins that contain the L-domain. Thus hcast 3-25 can be considered as a novel member and possible modulator of the calpain/calpastatin system acting by a mechanism alternative to inhibition.

Abstract: The three canonical members of the family of homeodomain-interacting protein (HIP) kinases fulfill overlapping and distinct roles in cellular stress response pathways. Here we systematically compared all three endogenous HIPKs for their intracellular distribution and mutual interactions. The endogenous HIPKs are contained in high molecular weight complexes of ~700 kDa but do not directly interact physically. Under basal conditions, HIPK1 was mostly cytoplasmic, while HIPK3 was found in the nucleus and HIPK2 occurred in both compartments. Inhibition of nuclear export by leptomycin B resulted in the nuclear accumulation of mainly HIPK1 and HIPK2, indicating constitutive dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The carcinogenic chemical stressor sodium arsenite caused the induction of HIPK2-dependent cell death and also resulted in a rapid and complete nuclear translocation of HIPK2, showing that the intracellular distribution of this kinase can undergo dynamic regulation.

Abstract: Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of cancer that does not respond to hormonal therapy and current therapeutic strategies are accompanied by side effects due to cytotoxic actions on normal tissues. Therefore, there is a need for the identification of anti-cancer compounds with negligible effects on non-tumoral cells. Here we show that (−)‑oleocanthal (OLCT), a phenolic compound isolated from olive oil, selectively impairs MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and viability without affecting the ability of non-tumoral MCF10A cells to proliferate or their viability. Similarly, OLCT selectively impairs the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to migrate while the ability of MCF10A to migrate was unaffected. The effect of OLCT was not exclusive for triple negative breast cancer cells as we found that OLCT also attenuate cell viability and proliferation of MCF7 cells. Our results indicate that OLCT is unable to induce Ca2+ mobilization in non-tumoral cells. By contrast, OLCT induces Ca2+ entry in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which is impaired by TRPC6 expression silencing. We have found that MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells overexpress the channel TRPC6 as compared to non-tumoral MCF10A and treatment with OLCT for 24–72 h downregulates TRPC6 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings indicate that OLCT impairs the ability of breast cancer cells to proliferate and migrate via downregulation of TRPC6 channel expression while having no effect on the biology of non-tumoral breast cells.

Abstract: Synaptosomal-associated protein of 23 kDa (SNAP-23) plays an important role during regulated exocytosis of various inflammatory mediators, stored in secretory granules, from mast cells in response to physiological triggers. It is however synthesized as a soluble protein, and the mechanisms by which free SNAP-23 gets peripherally associated with membrane for the regulation of exocytosis, are poorly defined. SNAP-23 contains a hydrophobic domain with five closely spaced cysteines which get palmitoylated, and we show that SNAP-23 cysteine mutants show differential membrane association when transfected in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. SNAP-23 Cys− mutant, devoid of all five cysteines, and SNAP-23 P119A (proline to alanine) mutant, that likely interferes with palmitoylation of SNAP-23 by palmitoyl transferases are completely cytosolic. Mutating specific cysteines (Cys; C) to leucine or phenylalanine (L or F; retains hydrophobicity but lacks palmitoylation) partially decreases the membrane association of SNAP-23 which is further hampered by alanine (A; has lesser hydrophobicity, and lacks palmitoylation) mutation at C79, C80 or C83 position. Cloning a transmembrane domain MDR31–145 from multidrug resistance protein into SNAP-23 Cys− mutant is able to partially restore its membrane association. Regulated exocytosis studies using co-transfected human growth hormone (hGH) secretion reporter plasmid revealed that overexpression of SNAP-23 Cys− and P119A mutants significantly inhibits the overall extent of exocytosis from RBL mast cells, whereas expression of SNAP-23 Cys−-MDR31–145 fusion protein is able to restore exocytosis. These results establish that the cysteine-rich domain of SNAP-23 regulates its membrane association and thereby also regulates exocytosis from mast cells.

Abstract: The proteome of the outer membrane of mitochondria and chloroplasts consists of membrane proteins anchored by α-helical or β-sheet elements. While proteins with α-helical transmembrane domains are present in all cellular membranes, proteins with β-barrel structure are specific for these two membranes. The organellar β-barrel proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome and thus, have to be targeted to the outer organellar membrane where they are recognized by surface exposed translocation complexes. In the last years, the signals that ensure proper targeting of these proteins have been investigated as essential base for an understanding of the regulation of cellular protein distribution. However, the organellar β-barrel proteins are unique as most of them do not contain a typical targeting information in form of an N-terminal cleavable targeting signal. Recently, it was discovered that targeting and surface recognition of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins in yeast, humans and plants depends on the hydrophobicity of the last β-hairpin of the β-barrel. However, we demonstrate that the hydrophobicity is not sufficient for the discrimination of targeting to chloroplasts or mitochondria. By domain swapping between mitochondrial and chloroplast targeted β-barrel proteins atVDAC1 and psOEP24 we demonstrate that the presence of a hydrophilic amino acid at the C-terminus of the penultimate β-strand is required for mitochondrial targeting. A mutation of the chloroplast β-barrel protein psOEP24 which mimics such profile is efficiently targeted to mitochondria. Thus, we present the properties of the signal for mitochondrial targeting of β-barrel proteins in plants.

Abstract: The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment, which governs ribosome biogenesis. Moreover, it functions as hub in the stress response by orchestrating a variety of processes, such as regulation of cell cycle progression, senescence and apoptosis. Emerging evidence links the nucleolus also to the control of genomic stability and the development of human malignancies. Peter Pan (PPAN) is an essential ribosome biogenesis factor localized to nucleoli and mitochondria. We earlier showed that PPAN depletion triggers p53-independent nucleolar stress and apoptosis. In this study we investigated the precise localization of nucleolar PPAN during cell cycle and its function in cell cycle regulation. We show that PPAN knockdown impairs cell proliferation and induces G0/G1 as well as later G2/M cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Although PPAN knockdown stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and induces CDKN1A/p21, the proliferation defects occur largely in a p53/p21-independent manner. We noticed a reduced number of knockdown cells entering cytokinesis and an elevation of binucleation. PPAN knockdown is also associated with increased H2A.X phosphorylation (γH2A.X) in cancer cells. We evaluated a potential signaling axis through the DNA damage response kinases ATM and ATR and alternatively apoptosis as a potent driver of γH2A.X. Interestingly, PPAN knockdown does not involve activation of ATM/ATR. Instead, γH2A.X is generated as a consequence of apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Strikingly, PPAN depletion in human fibroblasts did neither provoke apoptosis nor H2A.X phosphorylation, but recapitulated p53 stabilization. In summary, our data underline the notion that the PPAN-mediated, p53-independent nucleolar stress response has multiple facets.

ArhGAP12 plays dual roles in Stabilin-2 mediated efferocytosis: Regulates Rac1 basal activity and spatiotemporally turns off the Rac1 to orchestrate phagosome maturation,

Abstract: The rapid and precise clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) involves a series of phagocytic processes through which apoptotic cells are recognized, engulfed, and degraded within phagocytes. The Rho-family GTPases critically rearrange the cytoskeleton for these phagocytic processes, but we know little about the mechanisms by which regulatory proteins control the spatiotemporal activities of the Rho-family GTPases. Here, we identify ArhGAP12 as a functional GTPase-activating protein (GAP) of Rac1 during Stabilin-2 mediated efferocytosis. ArhGAP12 constitutively forms a complex with the phosphatidylserine receptor, Stabilin-2, via direct interaction with the downstream protein, GULP, but is released from the complex when Stabilin-2 interacts with apoptotic cells. When the phagocytic cup is closed and the apoptotic cell is surrounded by the phagosomal membrane, ArhGAP12 localizes to the phagocytic cup via a specific interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, which is transiently biosynthesized in the phagocytic cup. Down-regulation of ArhGAP12 results in sustained Rac1 activity, arrangement of F-actin, and delayed phagosome-lysosome fusion. Our results collectively suggest that ArhGAP12 carries dual roles in Stabilin-2 mediated efferocytosis: it binds to GULP/Stabilin-2 and switches off Rac1 basal activity and switches on the Rac1 by releasing itself from the complex. In addition, the spatiotemporal membrane targeting of ArhGAP12 inactivates Rac1 in a time-specific and spatially coordinated manner to orchestrate phagosome maturation. This may shed light on how other RhoGAPs spatiotemporally inactivate Rac or Cdc42 during phagocytosis by various cells, in different circumstances.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a long-term consequence of chronic inflammatory liver injury. Hepatic injury is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and increased hepatic exposure to bacterial products including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which promotes hepatocarcinogenesis. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mediator linking chronic inflammation with HCC development remains to be clarified. In this study, we explored the significant dual functions of active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in LPS-induced angiogenesis of HCC. The in vitro effects of active STAT3 in tumor cells and endothelial cells were assessed using angiogenesis assay, ELISA, confocal assay, flow cytometry and western blot. The in vivo role of active STAT3 was assessed in xenografts model in nude mice. Here we report a novel mechanism by which LPS/STAT3 signaling promotes the angiogenesis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. STAT3 activated by LPS increases the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells, which not only promotes the proliferation of HCC cells but also stimulates the migration and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells through STAT3 activation and hence promotes angiogenesis in HCC. Our findings not only provide a potential mechanism by which bacterial infection enhances HCC oncogenesis through promoting the angiogenesis in liver, but also suggest that targeting STAT3 might be an effective therapeutic strategy in HCC treatment considering the dual roles of STAT3 in angiogenesis.

Abstract: Physiological function and metabolic regulation are the most important outputs of circadian clock controls in mammals. Mitochondrial respiration and ROS production show rhythmic activity. Mitochondrial carriers, which are responsible for mitochondrial substance transfer, are vital for mitochondrial metabolism. Clock (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is the first core circadian gene identified in mammalian animals. However, whether CLOCK protein can regulate mitochondrial functions via mitochondrial carriers is unclear. Here, we showed that CLOCK can bind to the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10. For further analysis, we established a Slc25a10−/−-Hepa1-6 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Slc25a10−/−-Hepa1-6 cells showed disordered glucose homeostasis, increased oxidative stress levels, and damaged electron transport chains. Next, using an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that amino acids 43–84 and 169–210 in SLC25A10 are key sites that respond to CLOCK binding. Finally, forced expression of wild-type SLC25A10 in Slc25a10−/−-Hepa1-6 cells could compensate for the loss of SLC25A10; the decreased glucose metabolism, severe oxidative stress and damaged electron transport chain were recovered. In addition, a mutant Slc25a10 with changes in two key sites did not show a rescue effect. In conclusion, we identified a new protein-protein interaction mechanism in which CLOCK can directly regulate cell metabolism via the mitochondrial membrane transporter SLC25A10. Our study might provide some new insights into the relationship between circadian clock and mitochondrial metabolism.

Bright near-infrared fluorescence bio-labeling with a biliprotein triad,

Abstract: Biliproteins have extended the spectral range of fluorescent proteins into the near-infrared region (NIR, 700–770 nm) of maximal transmission of most tissues and are also favorable for multiplex labeling. Their application, however, presents considerable challenges to increase their stability under physiological conditions and, in particular, to increase their brightness while maintaining the emission in near-infrared regions: their fluorescence yield generally decreases with increasing wavelengths, and their effective brightness depends strongly on the environmental conditions. We report a fluorescent biliprotein triad, termed BDFP1.1:3.1:1.1, that combines a large red-shift (722 nm) with high brightness in mammalian cells and high stability under changing environmental conditions. It is fused from derivatives of the phycobilisome core subunits, ApcE2 and ApcF2. These two subunits are induced by far-red light (FR, 650–700 nm) in FR acclimated cyanobacteria. Two BDFP1.1 domains engineered from ApcF2 covalently bind biliverdin that is accessible in most cells. The soluble BDFP3 domain, engineered from ApcE2, binds phytochromobilin non-covalently, generating BDFP3.1. This phytochromobilin chromophore was added externally; it is readily generated by an improved synthesis in E. coli and subsequent extraction. Excitation energy absorbed in the FR by covalently bound biliverdins in the two BDFP1.1 domains is transferred via fluorescence resonance energy transfer to the non-covalently bound phytochromobilin in the BDFP3.1 domain fluorescing in the NIR around 720 nm. Labeling of a variety of proteins by fusion to the biliprotein triad is demonstrated in prokaryotic and mammalian cells, including human cell lines.

Abstract: Store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the most important Ca2+ entry pathway in non-excitable cells. However, SOCE can also play a pivotal role in excitable cells such as anterior pituitary (AP) cells. The AP gland contains five different cell types that release six major AP hormones controlling most of the entire endocrine system. AP hormone release is modulated by Ca2+ signals induced by different hypothalamic releasing hormones (HRHs) acting on specific receptors in AP cells. TRH and LHRH both induce Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry in responsive cells while GHRH and CRH only induce Ca2+ entry. SOCE has been shown to contribute to Ca2+ responses induced by TRH and LHRH but no molecular evidence has been provided. Accordingly, we used AP cells isolated from mice devoid of Orai1 channels (noted as Orai1−/− or Orai1 KO mice) and mice lacking expression of all seven canonical TRP channels (TRPC) from TRPC1 to TRPC7 (noted as heptaTRPC KO mice) to investigate contribution of these putative channel proteins to SOCE and intracellular Ca2+ responses induced by HRHs. We found that thapsigargin-evoked SOCE is lost in AP cells from Orai1−/− mice but unaffected in cells from heptaTRPC KO mice. Conversely, while spontaneous intracellular Ca2+-oscillations related to electrical activity were not affected in the Orai1−/− mice, these responses were significantly reduced in heptaTRPC KO mice. We also found that Ca2+ entry induced by TRH and LHRH is decreased in AP cells isolated from Orai1−/−. In addition, Ca2+ responses to several HRHs, particularly TRH and GHRH, are decreased in the heptaTRPC KO mice. These results indicate that expression of Orai1, and not TRPC channel proteins, is necessary for thapsigargin-evoked SOCE and is required to support Ca2+ entry induced by TRH and LHRH in mouse AP cells. In contrast, TRPC channel proteins appear to contribute to spontaneous Ca2+-oscillations and Ca2+ responses induced by TRH and GHRH. We conclude that expression of Orai1 and TRPC channels proteins may play differential and significant roles in AP physiology and endocrine control.

Abstract: Metastasis is the main cause of death in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Aberrant fucosylation, catalyzed by the specific fucosyltransferases (FUTs), is associated with malignant behaviors. Non-conding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), emerge as key molecules in cancer malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified fucosylation on sLeX-CD44 (HCELL), which served as E-selectin ligand during CRC progression. Higher levels of HOTAIR and FUT6 were verified in CRC tissues and cell lines, with a positive correlation. HOTAIR was associated with poor clinical prognosis of CRC. Altered HOTAIR levels influenced proliferation, aggressiveness, apoptosis and tumorigenesis of CRC cells. HOTAIR directly harbored miR-326 binding sites and regulated FUT6 expression. Further results corroborated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis modified α1, 3-fucosylation of CD44, which mediated CRC malignancy. Co-modulation of HOTAIR, miR-326 and FUT6 impacted α1, 3-fucosylated CD44, which further triggered PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. HOTAIR also mediated CRC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in vivo. Thus, our findings indicated that HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis mediated CRC procession through α1, 3-fucosylated CD44 via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This work rendered new therapeutic targets for CRC.

Abstract: Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is an abundant by-product of cellular metabolism. PPi-producing reactions take place in the nucleus concurrently with reactions that use PPi as a substrate. Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two soluble pyrophosphatases (sPPases): Ipp1p, an essential and allegedly cytosolic protein, and Ipp2p, a mitochondrial isoenzyme. However, no sPPase has yet been unambiguously described in the nucleus. In vivo studies with fluorescent fusions together with activity and immunodetection analyses demonstrated that Ipp1p is a nucleocytoplasmic protein. Mutagenesis analysis showed that this sPPase possesses a nuclear localization signal which participates in its nuclear targeting. Enforced nucleocytoplasmic targeting by fusion to heterologous nuclear import and export signals caused changes in polypeptide abundance and activity levels, indicating that Ipp1p is less stable in the nucleus that in the cytoplasm. Low nuclear levels of this sPPase are physiologically relevant and may be related to its catalytic activity, since cells expressing a functional nuclear-targeted chimaera showed impaired growth and reduced chronological lifespan, while a nuclear-targeted catalytically inactive protein was not degraded and accumulated in the nucleus. Moreover, nuclear proteasome inhibition stabilized Ipp1p whereas nuclear targeting promoted its ubiquitination and interaction with Ubp3p, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Overall, our results indicate that Ipp1p is nucleocytoplasmic, that its stability depends on its subcellular localization and that sPPase catalytic competence drives its nuclear degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This suggests a new scenario for PPi homeostasis where both nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear proteasome degradation of the sPPase should contribute to control nuclear levels of this ubiquitous metabolite.

Estrogen enhances human osteoblast survival and function via promotion of autophagy,

Abstract: Estrogen increases bone formation by promoting mineralization and prolonging the lifespan of osteoblasts. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism/s, we identified estrogen-regulated proteins at different stages of human osteoblast differentiation using differential proteomics approach. Among the identified proteins, we observed that estrogen upregulated RAB3GAP1 on day 1 and 5 of differentiation. RAB3GAP1 is critically involved in the process of autophagy, a eukaryotic degradative pathway essential for cell survival. We, therefore, investigated the effect of estrogen on autophagy in differentiating human osteoblasts and their precursors, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs exhibited high autophagic flux which declined during osteoblast differentiation, resulting in high basal apoptosis in osteoblasts. Estrogen reduced apoptosis in differentiating osteoblasts by promoting autophagy, thus contributing towards their longer lifespan. Further, MSCs were resistant against starvation-induced apoptosis, whereas, differentiating osteoblasts showed significant susceptibility towards it. Estrogen, in addition to promoting mineralization, protected differentiating osteoblasts from starvation-induced apoptosis by increasing autophagic flux. Autophagic flux in RAB3GAP1 knockdown osteoblasts appeared diminished, and showed increased apoptosis even in nutrient-rich conditions, and exhibited significantly impaired mineralization. However, irrespective of the presence of estrogen, starvation further enhanced apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, estrogen failed to promote mineralization in these osteoblasts. Our study illustrates that autophagy is essential for human osteoblast survival and mineralization, and osteoblasts are susceptible to apoptosis due to reduced autophagy during differentiation. Estrogen, via upregulation of RAB3GAP1, promotes autophagy in osteoblasts during differentiation thereby increasing their survival and mineralization capacity. Our study demonstrates the positive role of autophagy in bone homeostasis.

A novel function for the ER retention signals in the C-terminus of kainate receptor subunit, GluK5,

Abstract: Classically, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals in secreted integral membrane proteins impose the requirement to assemble with other cognate subunits to form functional assemblies before they can exit the ER. We report that GluK5 has two ER retention signals in its cytoplasmic C-terminus: an arginine-based signal and a di-leucine motif previously thought to be an endocytic motif. GluK5 assembles with GluK2, but surprisingly GluK2 association does little to block the ER retention signals. We find instead that the ER retention signals are blocked by two proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, SAP97 and CASK. We show that SAP97, in the presence of CASK and the receptor complex, assumes an extended conformation. In the extended conformation, SAP97 makes its SH3 and GuK domains available to bind and sterically mask the ER retention signals in the GluK5 C-terminus. SAP97 and CASK are also necessary for sorting receptor cargoes into the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. We show that the ER retention signals of GluK5 play a vital role in sorting the receptor complex in the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. These data suggest a new role for ER retention signals in trafficking integral membrane proteins in neurons.
Significance
We present evidence that the ER retention signals in the kainate receptors containing GluK5 impose a requirement for sorting into local dendritic secretory pathways in neurons, as opposed to traversing the somatic Golgi apparatus. There are two ER retention signals in the C-terminus of GluK5. We show that both are blocked by physical association with SAP97 and CASK. The SH3 and GuK domains of SAP97, in the presence of CASK, bind directly to each ER retention signal and form a complex. These results support an entirely new function for ER retention signals in the C-termini of neuronal receptors, such as NMDA and kainate receptors, and define a mechanism for selective entry of receptors into local secretory pathways.

Abstract: Cell migration is a critical mechanism controlling tissue morphogenesis, epithelial wound healing and tumor metastasis. Migrating cells depend on orchestrated remodeling of the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by the spectrin-adducin-based membrane skeleton. Expression of adducins is altered during tumorigenesis, however, their involvement in metastatic dissemination of tumor cells remains poorly characterized. This study investigated the roles of α-adducin (ADD1) and γ-adducin (ADD3) in regulating migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. ADD1 was mislocalized, whereas ADD3 was markedly downregulated in NSCLC cells with the invasive mesenchymal phenotype. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ADD1 and ADD3 in epithelial-type NSCLC and normal bronchial epithelial cells promoted their Boyden chamber migration and Matrigel invasion. Furthermore, overexpression of ADD1, but not ADD3, in mesenchymal-type NSCLC cells decreased cell migration and invasion. ADD1-overexpressing NSCLC cells demonstrated increased adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), accompanied by enhanced assembly of focal adhesions and hyperphosphorylation of Src and paxillin. The increased adhesiveness and decreased motility of ADD1-overexpressing cells were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Src. By contrast, the accelerated migration of ADD1 and ADD3-depleted NSCLC cells was ECM adhesion-independent and was driven by the upregulated expression of pro-motile cadherin-11. Overall, our findings reveal a novel function of adducins as negative regulators of NSCLC cell migration and invasion, which could be essential for limiting lung cancer progression and metastasis.

Abstract: The small GTPase Arl8 is known to be involved in the periphery-directed motility of lysosomes. However, the overall importance of moving these vesicles is still poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila Arl8 is required not only for the proper distribution of lysosomes, but also for autophagosome-lysosome fusion in starved fat cells, endosome-lysosome fusion in garland nephrocytes, and developmentally programmed secretory granule degradation (crinophagy) in salivary gland cells. Moreover, proper Arl8 localization to lysosomes depends on the shared subunits of the BLOC-1 and BORC complexes, which also promote autophagy and crinophagy. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Arl8 is responsible not only for positioning lysosomes but also acts as a general lysosomal fusion factor.

Abstract: Alpha-hemolysin (HlyA) of uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli irreversibly binds to human erythrocytes (RBCs) and triggers activation of ATP release and metabolic changes ultimately leading to hemolysis. We studied the regulation of extracellular ATP (ATPe) of RBCs exposed to HlyA. Luminometry was used to assess ATP release and ATPe hydrolysis, whereas changes in cell volume and morphology were determined by electrical impedance, ektacytometry and aggregometry. Exposure of RBCs to HlyA induced a strong increase of [ATPe] (3–36-fold) and hemolysis (1–44-fold), partially compensated by [ATPe] hydrolysis by ectoATPases and intracellular ATPases released by dead cells. Carbenoxolone, a pannexin 1 inhibitor, partially inhibited ATP release (43–67%). The un-acylated toxin ProHlyA and the deletion analog HlyA∆914-936 were unable to induce ATP release or hemolysis. For HlyA treated RBCs, a data driven mathematical model showed that simultaneous lytic and non-lytic release mainly governed ATPe kinetics, while ATPe hydrolysis became important after prolonged toxin exposure. HlyA induced a 1.5-fold swelling, while blocking this swelling reduced ATP release by 77%. Blocking ATPe activation of purinergic P2X receptors reduced swelling by 60–80%. HlyA-RBCs showed an acute 1.3–2.2-fold increase of Ca2+i, increased crenation and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Perfusion of HlyA-RBCs through adhesion platforms showed strong adhesion to activated HMEC cells, followed by rapid detachment. HlyA exposed RBCs exhibited increased sphericity under osmotic stress, reduced elongation under shear stress, and very low aggregation in viscous media. Overall results showed that HlyA-RBCs displayed activated ATP release, high but weak adhesivity, low deformability and aggregability and high sphericity.

Abstract: Liver damage induces hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, characterised by a fibrogenic, proliferative and migratory phenotype. Activated HSC are mainly regulated by transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1), which increases the production of extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. collagen-I) promoting the progression of hepatic fibrosis. AGAP2 (ArfGAP with GTPase domain, ankyrin repeat and PH domain 2) is a GTPase/GTP-activating protein involved in the actin remodelling system and receptor recycling. In the present work the role of AGAP2 in human HSC in response to TGFβ1 was investigated. LX-2 HSC were transfected with AGAP2 siRNA and treated with TGFβ1. AGAP2 knockdown prevented to some extent the proliferative and migratory TGFβ1-induced capacities of LX-2 cells. An array focused on human fibrosis revealed that AGAP2 knockdown partially prevented TGFβ1-mediated gene expression of the fibrogenic genes ACTA2, COL1A2, EDN1, INHBE, LOX, PDGFB, TGFΒ12, while favored the expression of CXCR4, IL1A, MMP1, MMP3 and MMP9 genes. Furthermore, TGFβ1 induced AGAP2 promoter activation and its protein expression in LX-2. Moreover, AGAP2 protein levels were significantly increased in liver samples from rats with thioacetamide-induced fibrosis. In addition, AGAP2 silencing affected TGFβ1-receptor 2 (TGFR2) trafficking in U2OS cells, blocking its effective recycling to the membrane. AGAP2 silencing in LX-2 cells prevented the TGFβ1-induced increase of collagen-I protein levels, while its overexpression enhanced collagen-I protein expression in the presence or absence of the cytokine. AGAP2 overexpression also increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylated levels in LX-2 cells. FAK and MEK1 inhibitors prevented the increase of collagen-I expression caused by TGFβ1 in LX-2 overexpressing AGAP2. In summary, the present work shows for the first time, that AGAP2 is a potential new target involved in TGFβ1 signalling, contributing to the progression of hepatic fibrosis.

Abstract: Bone marrow (BM) is a source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). MSCs provide a specific niche in the BM and biological features of EPCs may be changed with this niche. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) secreted from primary BM-MSCs and biological features of this niche on EPC development are still yet to be understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SDF-1 produced by MSCs on EPC development. We applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the knock-out of the SDF-1 gene in BM-derived MSCs. BM-derived EPCs were then cocultured with MSCsSDF-1−/− or MSCsSDF-1+/+ to identify the role of MSC-derived SDF-1α on proliferation, migration and angiogenic activity of EPCs. Next, pre-expanded EPCs were harvested and co-transplanted with MSCsSDF-1−/− or MSCsSDF-1+/+ into sublethally irradiated mice to analyze the potency of these cells for marrow reconstitution. Our results revealed that proliferation, colony formation, migration and angiogenic activity of EPCs was significantly increased after coculture with MSCsSDF-1+/+. We also found that co-transplantation of EPCs with MSCsSDF-1+/+, in contrast to MSCsSDF-1−/−, into irradiated mice resulted in marrow repopulation and hematologic recovery, leading to improved survival of transplanted mice. In conclusions, MSC-derived SDF-1 niche plays an important role in the development of EPCs and this niche is essential for bone marrow repopulation by these cells and can enhance the efficiency of EPC therapy for ischemic diseases.

Abstract: The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in the cytoplasm of cells and its products such as IL-1β are exported through a non-classical ER-Golgi pathway. Several mechanistically distinct models including exocytosis of secretory lysosomes, microvesicles (MVs) and extracellular vehicles (EVs) have been proposed for their release. In this study, we hypothesized that the NLRP3 inflammasome product, IL-1β in response to exogenously administrated and endogenously produced d-ribose stimulation is released via extracellular vesicles including EVs via a sphingolipid-mediated molecular mechanisms controlling lysosome and multivesicular body (MVB) interaction. First, we demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous d-ribose induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation to produce IL-1β, which was released via EVs in podocytes. Then, we found that colocalization of marker MVB marker VPS16 with IL-1β within podocytes increased upon d-ribose stimulation, which was accompanied by decreased colocalization of lysosome marker Lamp-1 and VPS16, suggesting decrease in MVB inclusion of IL-1β due to reduced lysosome and MVB interaction. All these changes were mimicked and accelerated by lysosome v-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin. Moreover, ceramide in podocytes was found elevated upon d-ribose stimulation, and prior treatments of podocyte with acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) inhibitor, amitriptyline, acid ceramidase (AC) inducer, genistein, or AC CRISPR/cas9 activation plasmids were found to decrease d-ribose-induced ceramide accumulation, EVs release and IL-1β secretion due to reduced interactions of lysosome with MVBs. These results suggest that inflammasome-derived products such as IL-1β during d-ribose stimulation are released via EVs, in which lysosomal sphingolipid-mediated regulation of lysosome function plays an important role.

Abstract: Phasor-assisted Metal Induced Energy Transfer–Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (MIET-FLIM) nanoscopy is introduced as a powerful tool for functional cell biology research. Thin metal substrates can be used to obtain axial super-resolution via nanoscale distance-dependent MIET from fluorescent dyes towards a nearby metal layer, thereby creating fluorescence lifetime contrast between dyes located at different nanoscale distance from the metal. Such data can be used to achieve axially super-resolved microscopy images, a process known as MIET-FLIM nanoscopy. Suitability of the phasor approach in MIET-FLIM nanoscopy is first demonstrated using nanopatterned substrates, and furthermore applied to characterize the distance distribution of the epithelial basal membrane of a biological cell from the gold substrate. The phasor plot of an entire cell can be used to characterize the full Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectory as a large distance heterogeneity within the sensing range of about 100 nm from the metal surface is present due to the extended shape of cell with curvatures. In contrast, the different proteins of nuclear lamina show strong confinement close to the nuclear envelope in nanoscale. We find the lamin B layer resides in average at shorter distances from the gold surface compared to the lamin A/C layer located in more extended ranges. This and the observed heterogeneity of the protein layer thicknesses suggests that A- and B-type lamins form distinct networks in the nuclear lamina. Our results provide detailed insights for the study of the different roles of lamin proteins in chromatin tethering and nuclear mechanics.

Abstract: Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a ‘tandem-repeat’-type galectin, has been described as a modulator of cellular functions including adhesion, spreading, growth arrest, apoptosis, pathogen recognition, autophagy, and immunomodulation. We have previously shown that activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), also known as CD166, serves as a receptor for endogenous Gal-8. ALCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell-cell adhesion through homophilic (ALCAM-ALCAM) and heterophilic (i.e. ALCAM-CD6) interactions in different tissues. Here we investigated the physiologic relevance of ALCAM-Gal-8 association and glycosylation-dependent mechanisms governing these interactions. We found that silencing of ALCAM in MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells decreases cell adhesion and migration onto Gal-8-coated surfaces in a glycan-dependent fashion. Remarkably, either Gal-8 or ALCAM silencing also disrupted cell-cell adhesion, and led to reduced tumor growth in a murine model of triple negative breast cancer. Moreover, structural characterization of endogenous ALCAM N-glycosylation showed abundant permissive structures for Gal-8 binding. Importantly, we also found that cell sialylation controls Gal-8-mediated cell adhesion. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a central role of either ALCAM or Gal-8 (or both) in controlling triple negative breast cancer.

Abstract: The osteoblast generation from Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is tightly coordinated by transcriptional networks and signalling pathways that control gene expression and protein stability of osteogenic “master transcription factors”. Among these pathways, a great attention has been focused on p53 and its physiological negative regulator, the E3 ligase Murine double minute 2 (Mdm2). Nevertheless, the signalling that regulates Mdm2-p53 axis in osteoblasts remain to be elucidated, also considering that Mdm2 possesses numerous p53-independent activities and interacts with additional proteins. Herein, the effects of Mdm2 modulation on MSC differentiation were examined by the use of short- and long-lasting inhibitors of the Mdm2-p53 complex. The long-lasting Mdm2-p53 dissociation was demonstrated to enhance the MSC differentiation into osteoblasts. The increase of Mdm2 levels promoted its association to G protein-coupled receptors kinase (GRK) 2, one of the most relevant kinases involved in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In turn, the long-lasting Mdm2-p53 dissociation decreased GRK2 levels and favoured the functionality of A2B Adenosine Receptors (A2BARs), a GPCR dictating MSC fate. EB148 facilitated cAMP accumulation, and mediated a sustained activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERKs) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Such pro-osteogenic effects were not detectable by using the reversible Mdm2-p53 complex inhibitor, suggesting the time course of Mdm2-p53 dissociation may impact on intracellular proteins involved in cell differentiation fate. These results suggest that the long-lasting Mdm2 binding plays a key role in the mobilization of intracellular proteins that regulate the final biological outcome of MSCs.

Abstract: A plasma membrane amino acid transporter B0,+ (ATB0,+), encoded by the SLC6A14 gene, is specific for neutral and basic amino acids. It is up-regulated in several types of malignant cancers. Neurotransmitter transporters of the SLC6 family interact with specific SEC24 proteins of the COPII complex along their pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi. This study focused on the possible role of SEC24 proteins in ATB0,+ trafficking. Rat ATB0,+ was expressed in HEK293 cells, its localization and trafficking were examined by Western blot, deglycosylation, immunofluorescence (co-localization with ER and trans-Golgi markers) and biotinylation. The expression of ATB0,+ at the plasma membrane was decreased by dominant negative mutants of SAR1, a GTPase, whose activity triggers the formation of the COPII complex. ATB0,+ co-precipitated with SEC24C (but not with the remaining isoforms A, B and D). This interaction was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and the proximity ligation assay. Co-localization of SEC24C with endogenous ATB0,+ was also observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Contrary to the endogenous transporter, part of the overexpressed ATB0,+ is directed to proteolysis, a process significantly reversed by a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Co-transfection with a SEC24C dominant negative mutant attenuated ATB0,+ expression at the plasma membrane, due to proteolytic degradation. These results support a hypothesis that lysine at position +2 downstream of the ER export “RI” motif on the cargo protein is crucial for SEC24C binding and for further trafficking to the Golgi.

Abstract: Mitochondrial diseases are a group of rare heterogeneous genetic disorders caused by total or partial mitochondrial dysfunction. They can be caused by mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial disorders caused by point mutations in mtDNA. It is mainly caused by the m.8344A > G mutation in the tRNALys (UUR) gene of mtDNA (MT-TK gene). This mutation affects the translation of mtDNA encoded proteins; therefore, the assembly of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes is disrupted, leading to a reduced mitochondrial respiratory function. However, the molecular pathogenesis of MERRF syndrome remains poorly understood due to the lack of appropriate cell models, particularly in those cell types most affected in the disease such as neurons. Patient-specific induced neurons (iNs) are originated from dermal fibroblasts derived from different individuals carrying the particular mutation causing the disease. Therefore, patient-specific iNs can be used as an excellent cell model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying MERRF syndrome. Here we present for the first time the generation of iNs from MERRF dermal fibroblasts by direct reprograming, as well as a series of pathophysiological characterizations which can be used for testing the impact of a specific mtDNA mutation on neurons and screening for drugs that can correct the phenotype.

Abstract: Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression is associated with an increased cell migration and related changes of the actin cytoskeleton (enhanced filopodia formation). These effects are mediated by the C-terminal cytoplasmic part of Cx43 in a channel-independent manner. Since this part has been shown to interact with a variety of proteins and has multiple phosphorylation sites we analyzed here a potential role of the protein kinase A (PKA) for the Cx43 mediated increase in cell migration. Mutation of the PKA-phosphorylation site (substitution of three serines by alanine or glycine) resulted in a further increase in cell motility compared to wild-type Cx43, but with a loss of directionality. Likewise, cell motility was enhanced by PKA inhibition only in Cx43 expressing cells, while reduced in the presence of the PKA activator forskolin. In contrast, cell motility remained unaffected by stimulation with forskolin in cells expressing Cx43 with the mutated PKA phosphorylation site (Cx43-PKA) as well as in Cx-deficient cells. Moreover, PKA activation resulted in increased binding of PKA and VASP to Cx43 associated with an enhanced phosphorylation of VASP, an important regulatory protein of cell polarity and directed migration. Functionally, we could confirm these results in endothelial cells endogenously expressing Cx43. A Tat-Cx43 peptide containing the PKA phosphorylation site abolished the PKA dependent reduction in endothelial cell migration. Our results indicate that PKA dependent phosphorylation of Cx43 modulates cell motility and plays a pivotal role in regulating directed cell migration.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a known tumor suppressor, which also exerts a tumor promoting activity at an advanced stage of cancer. Previously, we reported that expression of interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), also known as interferon regulatory factor-8, is positively correlated with TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression in osteosarcoma patient tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that ICSBP upregulated TGF-β RI and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenomena in human osteosarcoma cell lines. As determined by soft agar growth of osteosarcoma cells and xenografted mouse models, ICSBP increased tumorigenicity, which was reversed by ICSBP knock-down or a TGF-β RI inhibitor. To test whether ICSBP directly regulates the promoter activity of TGF-β RI, we performed a TGF-β RI promoter assay, an electro mobility shift assay, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that TGF-β RI promoter was activated in ICSBP-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells. Exploiting serial deletions and mutations of the TGF-β RI promoter, we found a putative ICSBP-binding site at nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter. Our data suggest that ICSBP upregulates TGF-β RI expression by binding to this site, causing ICSBP-mediated tumor progression in osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we found a positive correlation between ICSBP and TGF-β RI expression in several types of tumors using the cBioportal database.
Summary
We demonstrated that interferon consensus sequence-binding protein upregulates transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression by binding to nucleotides −216/−211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter, which resulted in increased tumorigenicity and tumor progression in human osteosarcoma cells.

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) promotes differentiation in multiple neurogenic cell types by promoting gene reprogramming through retinoid receptors and also by inducing cytosolic signaling events. The nuclear RXR receptors are one of the main mediators of RA cellular effects, classically by joining the direct receptors of RA, the nuclear RAR receptors, in RAR/RXR dimers which act as transcription factors. Distinct RXR genes lead to RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ subtypes, but their specific roles in neuronal differentiation remain unclear. We firstly investigated both RXRs and RARs expression profiles during RA-mediated neuronal differentiation of human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and found varying levels of retinoid receptors transcript and protein contents along the process. In order to understand the roles of the expression of distinct RXR subtypes to RA signal transduction, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing of RXRα and RXRβ during the first stages of SH-SY5Y differentiation. Our results showed that RXRα is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, since its silencing compromised cell cycle arrest and prevented the upregulation of neuronal markers and the adoption of neuronal morphology. Besides, silencing of RXRα affected the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. By contrast, silencing of RXRβ improved neurite extension and led to increased expression of tau and synaptophysin, suggesting that RXRβ may negatively regulate neuronal parameters related to neurite outgrowth and function. Our results indicate distinct functions for RXR subtypes during RA-dependent neuronal differentiation and reveal new perspectives for studying such receptors as clinical targets in therapies aiming at restoring neuronal function.

Abstract: During embryonic development, neural stem cells (NSCs) emerge as early as the neural plate stage and give rise to the nervous system. Early-stage NSCs express Sry-related-HMG box-1 (Sox1) and are biased towards neuronal differentiation. However, long-term maintenance of early-stage NSCs in vitro remains a challenge. Here, we report development of a defined culture condition for the long-term maintenance of Sox1-positive early-stage mouse NSCs. The proliferative ability of these Sox1-positive NSCs was confirmed by clonal propagation. Compared to the NSCs cultured using the traditional culture condition, the long-term self-renewing Sox1-positive NSCs efficiently differentiate into neurons and exhibit an identity representative of the anterior and midbrain regions. These early-stage Sox1-positive NSCs could also be switched to late-stage NSCs by being cultured with bFGF/EGF, which can then differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The long-term self-renewing Sox1-positive NSCs were defined as naïve NSCs, based on their high neuronal differentiation capacity and anterior regional identity. This culture condition provides a robust platform for further dissection of the NSC self-renewal mechanism and promotes potential applications of NSCs for cell-based therapy on nervous system disorders.

Abstract: The maintenance of stem cells often requires the support of feeder cells. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have traditionally been used as feeder cells, and although these MEF-derived feeder cells have exhibited a reasonable performance, they require repeated cell isolation, since MEFs cannot expand indefinitely. To overcome this limitation, immortalized cells, such as STO cells, have been used. However, one major disadvantage is that previously reported immortalized cells can only support stem cell cultures for a relatively short period, typically 4 to 7 days. In this study, we found that our newly established rat-derived fibroblasts immortalized by the expression of mutant cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D, and telomerase reverse transcriptase, can function as feeder cells for relatively long cell culture periods of approximately 14 days. The rat-derived immortalized cells developed in this study should be a useful source of feeder cells to support stem cell research.

Abstract: Increased GP73 expression in hepatocytes from patients with acute hepatitis, through disease progression to cirrhosis and chronic liver disease suggests that progressive tissue remodeling and fibrogenesis are driving forces for GP73 upregulation. Nevertheless, details about regulation of GP73 expression and its biological functions remain elusive and await further characterization. In this study, we demonstrate that GP73 is a direct target of TGF-β1 transcriptional regulation. Its induced expression inhibits TGF-β-Smad mediated growth suppression. On the other hand, elevated GP73 results in upregulation of ERK/Akt signaling induced by TGF-β1. Mechanistically, upregulation of lipid raft and caveolae-1 induced by GP73 overexpression mediates its regulatory effect on TGF-β1 signaling. Notably, lipid raft expression is elevated in HCC tumors and tissues with higher GP73 expression yield more intensive Flotillin staining. Our results establish the linkage between GP73 and TGF-β signaling, indicating that GP73 may promote HCC tumorigenesis by selectively regulating TGF-β signaling through lipid raft modulation.

Abstract: Mitochondrial tRNAs are processed at their 5’ends by highly divergent but ubiquitous RNase P. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rpm2p is the protein component of RNase P. Here, we identify four novel genes MTA1, MTA2, GEP5 and PET130 of the Saccharomycetaceae family that are necessary for an efficient processing of mitochondrial tRNAs. Null mutants of mta1, mta2 and gep5 have severely reduced levels of mitochondrial tRNAs; in addition, temperature sensitive (ts) mutants of mta1, mta2, pet130 and gep5 accumulated tRNAs precursor transcripts at the restrictive but not at the permissive temperature. The same mitochondrial tRNAs precursors were also identified in rpm2 ts mutants or in the double ts mutants mta1 rpm2 and mta2 rpm2. The genetic and physical association of these four novel genes corroborate the hypothesis that they have their function associated. Different combinations of mta1, mta2, pet130 and gep5 ts alleles display a synthetic respiratory deficient phenotype, an indication of genetic interactions of the genes. Indeed, Mta1p, Mta2p, Pet130p, and Gep5p are associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and are all extracted and sediment in sucrose gradients as high molecular weight complexes, where they may be present in a common complex with Rpm2p. This is supported by pull-down assays showing co-immunopurification of Rpm2 with Mta1p.

Abstract: The patterning of cytosolic Ca2+ signals underlies their ubiquitous ability to specifically regulate numerous cellular processes. Advances in fluorescence microscopy have made it possible to image these signals with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. However, this is a double-edged sword, as the resulting enormous data sets necessitate development of software to automate image processing and analysis. Here, we describe Flika, an open source, graphical user interface program written in the Python environment that contains a suite of built-in image processing tools to enable intuitive visualization of image data and analysis. We illustrate the utility and power of Flika by three applications for studying cellular Ca2+ signaling: a script for measuring single-cell global Ca2+ signals; a plugin for the detection, localization and analysis of subcellular Ca2+ puffs; and a script that implements a novel approach for fluctuation analysis of transient, local Ca2+ fluorescence signals.

Abstract: Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is a calcium and lipid binding protein involved in neuroendocrine secretion. We have previously demonstrated that AnxA2 participates in the formation and/or stabilization of lipid microdomains required for structural and spatial organization of the exocytotic machinery in chromaffin cells. However, the regulation of AnxA2 is not fully understood. Numerous phosphorylation sites have been identified in the amino-terminal domain of AnxA2. Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Tyr23 are well established and confirmed to be functionally significant. In particular, phosphorylation of Tyr23 by the tyrosine kinase pp60Src reduces the binding of AnxA2 to both actin filaments and the plasma membrane, two major actors of exocytosis, thus, we examined whether AnxA2 was phosphorylated on Tyr23 during exocytosis. Using immunolabelling and a biochemical approach, we found that nicotine stimulation triggered the phosphorylation of Anx A2 on Tyr23. The expression of two AnxA2 mutants carrying phosphorylation deficient (Y23A) or phosphomimetic (Y23E) mutations reduced the number exocytotic sites. Furthermore, expression of AnxA2-Y23A inhibited the formation of lipid microdomains, whereas the expression of AnxA2-Y23E altered actin filaments associated with docked granules. These results suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation switch at Tyr23 in AnxA2 is critical for calcium-regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells.

Abstract: The discovery of significant amounts of metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans renders it a promising target for anti-obesity therapies by inducing weight loss through increased energy expenditure. The components of the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) pathway are highly abundant in BAT. Aspartate N-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT, encoded by Nat8l) synthesizes NAA from acetyl-CoA and aspartate and increases energy expenditure in brown adipocytes. However, the exact mechanism how the NAA pathway contributes to accelerated mobilization and oxidation of lipids and the physiological regulation of the NAA pathway remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of NAA pathway genes corresponds to nutrient availability and specifically responds to changes in exogenous glucose. NAA is preferentially produced from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and aspartate and its concentration increases during adipogenesis. Overexpression of Nat8l drains glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the NAA pool at the expense of cellular lipids and certain amino acids. Mechanistically, we elucidated that a combined activation of neutral and lysosomal (acid) lipolysis is responsible for the increased lipid degradation. Specifically, translocation of the transcription factor EB to the nucleus activates the biosynthesis of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Lipid degradation within lysosomes accompanied by adipose triglyceride lipase-mediated lipolysis delivers fatty acids for the support of elevated mitochondrial respiration. Together, our data suggest a crucial role of the NAA pathway in energy metabolism and metabolic adaptation in BAT.

Abstract: The myeloid precursor cell differentiation requires an extensive chromatin remodeling. We show that the level of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex decreases following the start of differentiation of myeloid precursors, becoming very low in the terminally differentiated peripheral blood (PB) neutrophils where it co-localizes with Pol II on the transcriptionally active chromatin. Previously, we have shown that the PHF10 subunit of the PBAF signature module has four isoforms, two of them (PHF10-P) contain a tandem of C-terminal PHD domains. We found that out of four PHF10 isoforms present in the myeloid precursor cells, only the PHF10-Ss isoform lacking PHD domains, is actively expressed in the PB neutrophils. In particular, the longest of the PHF10 isoforms (PHF10-Pl), which is essential for proliferation, completely disappears in PB neutrophils. In addition, in the myeloid precursors, promoters of neutrophil-specific genes are associated with the PHD-containing isoforms, together with PBAF and Pol II, when these genes are inactive and only during their activation stage. However, at the later stages of differentiation, when neutrophil-specific genes are actively transcribed, PHF10-P isoforms on their promoters are replaced by the PHF10-S isoforms. Evidently, PHD domains of PHF10 are essential for active chromatin remodeling during transcription activation, but are dispensable for the constantly transcribed genes.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle fibres support store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) across the t-tubular membrane upon exhaustive depletion of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Recently we demonstrated the presence of a novel mode of SOCE activated under conditions of maintained [Ca2+]SR. This phasic SOCE manifested in a fast and transient manner in synchrony with excitation contraction (EC)-coupling mediated SR Ca2+-release (Communications Biology 1:31, doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0033-7). Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and calcium release-activated calcium channel 1 (ORAI1), positioned at the SR and t-system membranes, respectively, are the considered molecular correlate of SOCE. The evidence suggests that at the triads, where the terminal cisternae of the SR sandwich a t-tubule, STIM1 and ORAI1 proteins pre-position to allow for enhanced SOCE transduction. Here we show that phasic SOCE is not only shaped by global [Ca2+]SR but provide evidence for a local activation within nanodomains at the terminal cisternae of the SR. This feature may allow SOCE to modulate [Ca2+]SR during EC coupling. We define SOCE to occur on the same timescale as EC coupling and determine the temporal coherence of SOCE activation to SR Ca2+ release. We derive a delay of 0.3 ms reflecting diffusive Ca2+-equilibration at the luminal ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) channel mouth upon SR Ca2+-release. Numerical simulations of Ca2+-calsequestrin binding estimates a characteristic diffusion length and confines an upper limit for the spatial distance between STIM1 and RyR1. Experimental evidence for a 4- fold change in t-system Ca2+-permeability upon prolonged electrical stimulation in conjunction with numerical simulations of Ca2+-STIM1 binding suggests a Ca2+ dissociation constant of STIM1 below 0.35 mM. Our results show that phasic SOCE is intimately linked with RyR opening and closing, with only μs delays, because [Ca2+] in the terminal cisternae is just above the threshold for Ca2+ dissociation from STIM1 under physiological resting conditions.

Abstract: During Freund's adjuvant induced inflammation rat mesenteric mesothelial cells transdifferentiate into mesenchymal cell. They express macrophage markers, inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β, TNFα, IL-6), and specific receptors. When primary mesenteric cultures were treated with GM-CSF and/or TGF-β (in vitro), similar phenotypic and biological changes were induced. It seemed likely that GM-CSF receptor-ligand complex should be internalized to initiate mesothelial-macrophage transition. To follow the intracellular route of GM-CSF receptor β, we co-localized this receptor with various endocytic markers (Cav-1, EEA1, Rab7, and Rab11a), and carried out detailed immunocytochemical, statistical and biochemical analyses. Since STAT5 is one of the downstream element of GM-CSF signaling, we followed the expression and phosphorylation level of this transcription factor. Our results showed that in mesenteric mesothelial cells GM-CSF receptor β is internalized by caveolae, delivered into early endosomes where the signaling events occur, STAT5A is phosphorylated by JAK2, and then translocated into the nucleus. When dynamin-dependent endocytosis of GM-CSFR β is inhibited by dynasore, phosphorylation of STAT5A is not occurred, confirming, that the internalization of receptor β is indispensable for signal transduction. At the early time of inflammation a significant receptor recycling can be found to the plasma membrane. Later (day 8) the receptor is delivered into late endosomes, indicating that its degradation has already started, and the regeneration of mesothelial cells can start. All of these data strongly support that the internalization of GM-CSF receptor β is required and essential for signal transduction.

Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that arginase contributes to endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Intracellular signaling pathways, which interplay between arginase and eNOS enzyme activity leading to the development of endothelial dysfunction in hyperglycemia are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed the possible involvement of hyperglycemia (HG) induced arginase expression in eNOS protein regulation and activity and also the impact of arginase inhibition on eNOS activity. Furthermore, the roles of p38 MAPK and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in upregulation of arginase expression and eNOS dysregulation in endothelial cells (ECs) under hyperglycemia were evaluated. Protein analysis showed a concurrent increase in arginase I expression and decrease in eNOS expression and phosphorylation at Ser1177 under HG conditions. There was no simultaneous change in phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495 in HG. Arginase inhibition prevented increased arginase activity, restored impaired NO bioavailability and reduced superoxide anion generation. Inhibition of MAP-kinases demonstrated that, unlike Erk1/2, p38 MAPK is an upstream activator in a signaling cascade leading to increased arginase I in HG conditions. P38 MAPK protein expression and phosphorylation were increased in response to HG. In the presence of a p38 MAPK inhibitor, HG-induced arginase expression was blunted. Although Erk1/2 was activated in HG, increased arginase expression was not blocked by co-treatment with an Erk1/2 inhibitor. Activation of both, p38 MAPK and Erk1/2 in HG, induced a downregulation in eNOS activity. Hence, applying MAPK inhibitors increased eNOS phosphorylation in HG. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate contributions of arginase I in the development of endothelial cell dysfunction under HG conditions via impaired eNOS regulation, which maybe mediated by p38 MAPK.

Abstract: Nrf2 is the main transcription factor involved in expression of cell defense enzymes, which is altered in several oxidant-related disorders. Cytosolic Nrf2 activation is modulated through phosphorylation by PKCδ, an enzyme controlled by Src tyrosine kinases. Of relevance, Src family members are involved in numerous cellular processes and regulated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study we analysed the activation of cell survival-related signaling proteins, c-Src and Nrf2, and the influence of c-Src kinase on Nrf2 regulation after exposure to H2O2. Acute exposure of HT22 mouse hippocampal neural cells to H2O2 increased c-Src and Nrf2 phosphorylation/activation at Tyr416 and Ser40, respectively. Nrf2 phosphorylation at Ser40, its nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity involving heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression were dependent on c-Src kinase activation. Moreover, modulation of Nrf2 activity by c-Src occurred through PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr311. We demonstrate, for the first time, c-Src-mediated regulation of Nrf2 transcriptional activity, via PKCδ activation, following an acute H2O2 stimulus. This work supports that the c-Src/PKCδ/Nrf2 pathway may constitute a novel signaling pathway stimulated by H2O2 and a potential target for the treatment of diseases involving redox deregulation.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) converts sphingosine to the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P binds to G-protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1–5) to regulate cellular events, including Ca2+ signaling. The SK1/S1P axis and Ca2+ signaling both play important roles in health and disease. In this respect, Ca2+ microdomains at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) are of importance in oncogenesis. Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) modulates ER-mitochondria contacts, and dysregulation of MFN2 is associated with malignancies. We show that overexpression of SK1 augments agonist-induced Ca2+ release from the ER resulting in increased mitochondrial matrix Ca2+. Also, overexpression of SK1 induces MFN2 fragmentation, likely through increased calpain activity. Further, expressing putative calpain-cleaved MFN2 N- and C-terminal fragments increases mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ during agonist stimulation, mimicking the SK1 overexpression in cells. Moreover, SK1 overexpression enhances cellular respiration and cell migration. Thus, SK1 regulates MFN2 fragmentation resulting in increased mitochondrial Ca2+ and downstream cellular effects.

Abstract: Hearing loss is among the most prevalent sensory impairments in humans. Cochlear implantable devices represent the current therapies for hearing loss but have various shortcomings. ERM (ezrin- radixin -moesin) are a family of adaptor proteins that link plasma membrane with actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in cell morphology and in the formation of membrane protrusions. Recently, bioactive sphingolipids have emerged as regulators of ERM proteins. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic sphingolipid which regulates fundamental cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, migration as well as processes such as development and inflammation mainly via ligation to its specific receptors S1PR (S1P1–5). Experimental findings demonstrate a key role for S1P signaling axis in the maintenance of auditory function. Preservation of cellular junctions is a fundamental function both for S1P and ERM proteins, crucial for the maintenance of cochlear integrity. In the present work, S1P was found to activate ERM in a S1P2-dependent manner in murine auditory epithelial progenitors US/VOT-E36. S1P-induced ERM activation potently contributed to actin cytoskeletal remodeling and to the appearance of ionic currents and membrane passive properties changes typical of more differentiated cells. Moreover, PKC and Akt activation was found to mediate S1P-induced ERM phosphorylation. The obtained findings contribute to demonstrate the role of S1P signaling pathway in inner ear biology and to disclose potential innovative therapeutical approaches in the field of hearing loss prevention and treatment.

Abstract: The guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway facilitates targeting and insertion of tail-anchored proteins into membranes. In plants, such a protein insertion machinery for the endoplasmic reticulum as well as constituents within mitochondrial and chloroplasts were discovered. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that Get3 sequences of Embryophyta form two clades representing cytosolic (“a”) and organellar (“bc”) GET3 homologs, respectively. Cellular fractionation of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and usage of the self-assembly GFP system in protoplasts verified the cytosolic (ATGet3a), plastidic (ATGet3b) and mitochondrial (ATGet3c) localization of the different homologs. The identified plant homologs of Get1 and Get4 in A. thaliana are localized in ER and cytosol, respectively, implicating a degree of conservation of the GET pathway in A. thaliana. Transient expression of Get3 homologs of Solanum lycopersicum, Medicago × varia or Physcomitrella patens with the self-assembly GFP technique in homologous and heterologous systems verified that multiple Get3 homologs with differing subcellular localizations are common in plants. Chloroplast localized Get3 homologs were detected in all tested plant systems. In contrast, mitochondrial localized Get3 homologs were not identified in S. lycopersicum, or P. patens, while we confirmed on the example of A. thaliana proteins that mitochondrial localized Get3 proteins are properly targeted in S. lycopersicum as well.

Abstract: Orai proteins form highly selective Ca2+ release-activated channels (CRACs). They play a critical role in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE; i.e., the influx of external Ca2+ that is induced by the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores). Of the three Orai homologs that are present in mammals (Orai1–3), the physiological function of Orai1 is the best described. CRACs are formed by both homomeric assemblies and heteromultimers of Orais. Orai1 and Orai2 can form heteromeric channels that differ in conductivity during SOCE, depending on their Orai1-to-Orai2 ratio. The present study explored the potential consequences of ORAI1 overexpression in neurons where the dominant isoform is Orai2. We established the Tg(ORAI1)Ibd transgenic mouse line that overexpresses ORAI1 in brain neurons. We observed seizure-like symptoms in aged (≥15-month-old) female mice but not in males of the same age. The application of kainic acid and bicuculline to slices that were isolated from 8-month-old (±1 month) female Tg(ORAI1)Ibd mice revealed a significantly lower frequency of interictal bursts compared with samples that were isolated from wildtype mice. No differences were observed in male mice of a similar age. A battery of behavioral tests showed that context recognition decreased only in female transgenic mice. The phenotype that was observed in female mice suggests that ORAI1 overexpression may affect neuronal activity in a sex-dependent manner.

Abstract: Iron‑sulfur (Fe/S) clusters are versatile inorganic cofactors that play central roles in essential cellular functions, from respiration to genome stability. >30 proteins involved in Fe/S protein biogenesis in eukaryotes are known, many of which bind clusters via cysteine residues. This opens up the possibility that the thiol-reducing glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems are required at both the Fe/S biogenesis and target protein level to counteract thiol oxidation. To address the possible interplay of thiol redox chemistry and Fe/S protein biogenesis, we have characterized the status of the mitochondrial (ISC) and cytosolic (CIA) Fe/S protein assembly machineries in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in which the three partially redundant glutathione (Glr1) and thioredoxin (Trr1 and Trr2) oxidoreductases have been inactivated in either mitochondria, cytosol, or both compartments. Cells devoid of mitochondrial oxidoreductases maintained a functional mitochondrial ISC machinery and showed no altered iron homeostasis despite a non-functional complex II of the respiratory chain due to redox-specific defects. In cells that lack either cytosolic or total cellular thiol reducing capacity, both the ISC system and iron homeostasis were normal, yet cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S target proteins were not matured. This dysfunction could be attributed to a failure in the assembly of [4Fe‑4S] clusters in the CIA factor Nar1, even though Nar1 maintained robust protein levels and stable interactions with later-acting CIA components. Overall, our analysis has uncovered a hitherto unknown thiol-dependence of the CIA machinery and has demonstrated the surprisingly varying sensitivity of Fe/S proteins to thiol oxidation.

Abstract: Calreticulin an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is involved in the quality control process and plays an important role as a regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Previously, we illustrated that loss of calreticulin (crt−/−) results in the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway facilitating the increased resistance to apoptosis. Our preliminary data illustrated a significant increase in the endocytosis in the calreticulin knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (crt−/−). Therefore, we hypothesized that the mechanism for this increased endocytosis in the crt−/− cells is due to onset of ER stress. To test this hypothesis, we measured endocytosis in the wild type (wt) and crt−/− cells using uptake of fluorescent dextran and showed a significant increase in the rate of its uptake in crt−/− cells as compared to wt cells. To determine the endocytic pathway involved we examined both clathrin and caveolin-1 dependent endocytosis. Our results illustrated no change in the expression of clathrin heavy chain while there was a significant increase in the expression of caveolin-1 in the crt−/− cells as compared to the wt cells. Furthermore, using shRNA we illustrated that knockdown of clathrin heavy chain had no effect on endocytosis in the crt−/− cells. While knock-down of caveolin-1 significantly reduced endocytosis in the crt−/− cells. Finally, we illustrated that a chemical chaperone, 4‑phenylbutyrate significantly reduced both the endoplasmic reticulum stress and endocytosis in the crt−/− cells. Our data shows for the first time, that ER stress led to enhanced caveolin-1 mediated endocytosis and reversal of ER stress reduces endocytosis.

Abstract: Caspase family contains cysteine proteases involving in the key cellular processes, such as apoptosis, inflammation, and autophagy. There is a growing body of evidence that caspase family also plays a role in cellular differentiation. Evidence suggests that caspase-9 is among the most important members with non-apoptotic roles in the execution of differentiation. Since drug-induced differentiation in some types of cancer cells is a promising treatment, we have investigated caspase-9 activity during differentiation of a cancer cell; leukemia. We demonstrate that caspase-9 has increased activity during differentiation and also the inhibition of caspase-9 will prevent the granulocytic differentiation of leukemic cells. In addition, we studied the differentiation induction mediated by caspase-9 using an inducible variant of caspase-9. Results indicate the caspase-9 mediated differentiation accompanied by a reduction in the expression of CD33 and an increase in CD15. Notably, all of the events occur when cell viability remains constant. Owing to the evidence, caspase-9 activity is considered as a central factor in the execution of differentiation in leukemic cells.

Abstract: The biochemical properties of muscle extracellular matrix are essential for stem cell adhesion, motility, proliferation and myogenic development. Recombinant elastin-like polypeptides are synthetic polypeptides that, besides maintaining some properties of the native protein, can be tailored by fusing bioactive sequences to their C-terminal. Our laboratory synthesized several Human Elastin-Like Polypeptides (HELP) derived from the sequence of human tropoelastin. Here, we developed a novel HELP family member by fusing the elastin-like backbone to the sequence of human Epidermal Growth Factor. We employed this synthetic protein, named HEGF, either alone or in combination with other proteins of the HELP family carrying RGD-integrin binding sites, as adhesion substrate for C2C12 myoblasts and satellite cells primary cultures. Adhesion of myoblasts to HEGF-based substrates induced scattering, decreased adhesion and cytoskeleton assembly; the concomitant presence of the RGD motifs potentiated all these effects. Recombinant substrates induced myoblasts proliferation, differentiation and the development of multinucleated myotubes, thus favoring myoblasts expansion and preserving their myogenic potential. The effects induced by adhesion substrates were inhibited by AG82 (Tyrphostin 25) and herbimycin A, indicating their dependence on the activation of both the EGF receptor and the tyrosine kinase c-src. Finally, HEGF increased the number of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) derived from isolated muscle fibers in culture, thus highlighting its potential as a novel substrate for skeletal muscle regeneration strategies.

Abstract: Recent evidences highlight the importance of mitochondria-nucleus communication for the clinical phenotype of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) diseases. However, the participation of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in this communication has been poorly explored. We asked whether OXPHOS dysfunction alters the production of a new class of sncRNAs, mitochondrial tRNA fragments (mt tRFs), and, if so, whether mt tRFs play a physiological role and their accumulation is controlled by the action of mt tRNA modification enzymes. To address these questions, we used a cybrid model of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), an OXPHOS disease mostly caused by mutation m.3243A>G in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene. High-throughput analysis of small-RNA-Seq data indicated that m.3243A>G significantly changed the expression pattern of mt tRFs. A functional analysis of potential mt tRFs targets (performed under the assumption that these tRFs act as miRNAs) indicated an association with processes that involve the most common affected tissues in MELAS. We present evidences that mt tRFs may be biologically relevant, as one of them (mt i-tRF GluUUC), likely produced by the action of the nuclease Dicer and whose levels are Ago2 dependent, down-regulates the expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1), promoting the build-up of extracellular lactate. Therefore, our study underpins the idea that retrograde signaling from mitochondria is also mediated by mt tRFs. Finally, we show that accumulation of mt i-tRF GluUUC depends on the modification status of mt tRNAs, which is regulated by the action of stress-responsive miRNAs on mt tRNA modification enzymes.

Abstract: Background
Chronic nephropathies result from different pathogenic agents, including nutritional factors triggering vicious pathophysiological cycles. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a globally occurring nephrotoxic mycotoxin detectable in a variety of foodstuff and suspected to cause tubulointerstitial damage. The underlying mechanisms are not sufficiently understood, compromising risk assessment. Because crosstalk of proximal tubule cells with fibroblasts is crucial for tubulointerstitial damage, we investigated the effects of OTA in co-culture of these two cell types.
Methods
Rat renal proximal tubule cells (NRK-52E) and renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) were exposed to nanomolar OTA concentrations under mono- and/or co-culture conditions for up to 48 h. We determined the impact on inflammation-, EMT- and fibrosis-associated proteins as well as microRNAs by western blot or qPCR, respectively. Alterations in cell morphology were quantitatively assessed. The roles of miRs, COX-2 and ERK1/2 in OTA-induced effects were investigated by specific inhibition.
Findings
Only under co-culture condition, OTA caused an increase of vimentin, fibronectin and miR-21 and a decrease of collagen III, E-cadherin, COX-2 and WISP1 mRNA abundance in NRK-52E cells. In NRK-49F cells, OTA induced an increase of N-cadherin, COX-2, WISP1 in co-culture only. The OTA-induced increase of fibronectin in NRK-52E cells was prevented by simultaneous inhibition of miR-21 and -200a, COX-2 or ERK1/2. The OTA-induced increase of COX-2 in NRK-49F cells was prevented by inhibition of miR-21 and -200a or ERK1/2.
Interpretation
Our results show that the complete nephropathic potential of nanomolar OTA, leading to EMT, is unveiled when cellular crosstalk is possible. In monoculture, the nephropathic potential is underestimated.
Research in context
Chronic nephropathies are a severe health burden and the result of different pathogenic mechanisms, including nutritional factors that trigger vicious pathophysiological cycles. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a ubiquitous, globally occurring nephrotoxic mycotoxin detectable in a variety of foodstuff and suspected to cause tubulointerstitial damage. Because underlying pathomechanisms are unclear, risk assessment is problematic. Crosstalk of proximal tubule cells (the main target of OTA) with fibroblasts is crucial for the development of tubulointerstitial damage. We show that during co-culture of proximal tubule cells and fibroblasts, OTA-induced effects (e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) change significantly as compared to monoculture. Our results show that the complete nephropathic potential of OTA is unveiled when cellular crosstalk is possible. In monoculture, the nephropathic potential of OTA is underestimated.

Abstract: Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) is a lipid that accumulates in the early endosomal membrane, and acts as a scaffold to recruit proteins that contain a PI3P-binding domain, such as the FYVE domain. In this study, we examined the effect of PI3P depletion on the insulin response in rat hepatoma-derived H4IIEC3 cells. We found that insulin treatment induced the transient formation of an actin domain structure, a mesh-like tangled network of actin filaments where phosphorylated Akt, endosomal proteins, and PI3P accumulated. Actin domain formation was repressed by the depletion of PI3P by SAR405, an inhibitor of the class III PI3 kinase, Vps34, by the inhibition of PI3P function by the competitive binding of an excess amount of GST-fused 2xFYVE protein to intracellular PI3P, and by the use of diabetic model cells, in which PI3P was depleted. SAR405 did not affect the phosphorylation level of Akt, and the transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenic and cholesterol synthetic genes after insulin treatment. Interestingly, insulin-induced DNA synthesis was specifically inhibited by SAR405, cytochalasin B, and also in diabetic model cells. These results suggest that PI3P is required for the formation of actin domains, which affected a signaling pathway downstream of Akt associated with DNA synthesis in H4IIEC3 cells.

Abstract: TRPM2 is a non-selective, Ca2+-permeable cation channel, which plays a role in cell death but also contributes to diverse immune cell functions. In addition, TRPM2 contributes to the control of body temperature and is involved in perception of non-noxious heat and thermotaxis. TRPM2 is regulated by many factors including Ca2+, ADPR, 2′-deoxy-ADPR, Ca2+-CaM, and temperature. However, the molecular basis for the temperature sensitivity of TRPM2 as well as the interplay between the regulatory factors is still not understood. Here we identify a novel CaM-binding site in the unique NudT9H domain of TRPM2. Using a multipronged biophysical approach we show that binding of Ca2+-CaM to this site occurs upon partial unfolding at temperatures >35 °C and prevents further thermal destabilization. In combination with patch-clamp measurements of full-length TRPM2 our results suggest a role of this CaM-binding site in the temperature sensitivity of TRPM2.

Abstract: Many cell stressors block protein translation, inducing formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. These aggregates, named stress granules (SGs), are composed by translationally stalled ribonucleoproteins and their assembly strongly contributes to cell survival. Composition and dynamics of SGs are thus important starting points for identifying critical factors of the stress response. In the present study we link components of the H/ACA snoRNP complexes, highly concentrated in the nucleoli and the Cajal bodies, to SG composition. H/ACA snoRNPs are composed by a core of four highly conserved proteins -dyskerin, Nhp2, Nop10 and Gar1- and are involved in several fundamental processes, including ribosome biogenesis, RNA pseudouridylation, stabilization of small nucleolar RNAs and telomere maintenance. By taking advantage of cells overexpressing a dyskerin splice variant undergoing a dynamic intracellular trafficking, we were able to show that H/ACA snoRNP components can participate in SG formation, this way contributing to the stress response and perhaps transducing signals from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Collectively, our results show for the first time that H/ACA snoRNP proteins can have additional non-nuclear functions, either independently or interacting with each other, thus further strengthening the close relationship linking nucleolus to SG composition.
