Abstract: Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) hydrolyses galactose residues from various substrates, including galactosylceramide, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), and lactosylceramide. Its severe deficiency has been associated with the accumulation of psychosine, a toxic molecule with detergent-like features, which alters membrane structures and signalling pathways, inducing the death of oligodendrocytes and a sequence of events in the nervous system that explain the appearance of many clinical signs typical of Krabbe disease. Nevertheless, new evidence suggests the existence of other possible links among GALC action, myelination, and myelin stability, apart from psychosine release. In this study, we demonstrated that lactosylceramide metabolism is impaired in fibroblasts isolated from patients with Krabbe disease in the absence of psychosine accumulation. This event is responsible for the aberrant and constitutive activation of the AKT/prolin-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) signalling axis, inducing B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) overexpression and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) inhibition. In addition, nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) showed increased nuclear translocation. Due to the relevance of these molecular alterations in neurodegeneration, lactosylceramide increase should be evaluated as a novel marker of Krabbe disease, and because of its significant connections with signalling pathways.

Abstract: Platelet-derived growth factors are critical for cerebrovascular development and homeostasis. Abnormalities in this signalling pathway are implicated in neurological diseases, especially those where neurovascular dysfunction and neuroinflammation plays a prominent role in disease pathologies, such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease; the angiogenic nature of this pathway also draws its significance in brain malignancies such as glioblastoma where tumour angiogenesis is profuse. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the actions of the platelet-derived growth factors on neurovascular function, their role in the regulation of perivascular cell types expressing the cognate receptors, neurological diseases associated with aberrance in signalling, and highlight the clinical relevance and therapeutic potentials of this pathway for central nervous system diseases.

Abstract: Magnetic microcapsulated phase change materials can achieve rapid magnetic localization temperature regulation and magnetic separation recycling. However, the efficient encapsulation of both inorganic magnetic material and organic phase change material is a challenge due to their poor compatibility. In this work, an aqueous dispersion containing methylol melamine and sodium alginate loaded with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (SA-Fe3O4) was prepared and mixed with a paraffin emulsion. After methylol melamine was initiated to in-situ polymerize at the interface of the paraffin emulsion droplets, primary magnetic phase change microcapsules (P-MPCM) composed of a paraffin core and SA-Fe3O4/melamine formaldehyde resin composite shell were formed. Then, SiO2 sol particles were adsorbed on the surface of P-MPCM to form the final MPCM with a polymer-SiO2 double-shell (PS-MPCM). The magnetic polymer-SiO2 double-shell endows the PS-MPCM with rapid magnetic responsiveness (can be quickly collected under magnetic fields), high phase change enthalpy (184.4 J·g-1) and excellent structural stability. The phase change enthalpy and saturation magnetization of PS-MPCM have changed little after 200 thermal cycles. At the same time, the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (93.9%) of PS-MPCM benefits for solar energy conversion utilization in actual application. This work provides a new way to obtain MPCM with high thermal conductivity (0.64 W·m-1·K-1), rapid magnetic response and excellent reusability, which can be potentially applied for directional temperature regulation.

Abstract: Poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts enable the manufacturing of highly-efficient Si solar cells, but their fabrication commonly relies on an extra high-temperature process such as dopant diffusion or thermal annealing for achieving excellent passivation and contacting properties. This extra process is eliminated in the fired passivating contact (FPC) approach used for simplified fabrication of poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts. Instead, FPCs rely on the thermal budget of the fast/short and high-temperature firing process used for metallization of solar cells to achieve similar final properties. Despite this, compatibility of FPCs with industrially viable metallization techniques has not been demonstrated yet, which is studied in this work for fire-through Ag screen-printing and Ni/Ag plating. With screen-printing, low recombination current density (J0) down to 4.9 fA/cm2, low contact resistivity between the Ag contacts and the FPC (ρc,m) down to 7.2 mΩ⋅cm2, and Ohmic transport through the FPC including the SiOx film were achieved using wet-chemically grown SiOx. Nevertheless, J0 of metallized regions (J0,m) exceeded 1000 fA/cm2. Reducing J0,m was attempted by mitigating the blistering observed in FPCs, but J0,m remained high. With Ni/Ag plating, excellent surface passivation with J0 down to 2.7 fA/cm2 and very low J0,m < 50 fA/cm2 were achieved, but no Ohmic contacts could be obtained. Integration of screen-printed FPCs in large-area n-TOPCon solar cells was also demonstrated, yielding average efficiencies of 18.4%, limited mainly by the high J0,m and series resistance of the FPCs. The results presented reveal the challenges for the industrialization of FPCs and provide valuable insights for tackling these.

Abstract: PV modules can quickly accumulate a light hindering layer of dust on the front glass, especially in arid regions. This soiling needs to be removed regularly, often using dry brushes as water is usually not easily available to wash the panels. Repeated cleaning negatively affects the anti-reflective coating (ARC) on the glass, leading to permanent transmittance loss and therefore a reduced energy yield. Within this work, two different ARCs and a reference glass are investigated regarding their resistance against harsh abrasion with a dry linear brushing abrasion cycle tester for laboratory and mobile use. The reduction of the spectral transmission is studied as a function of brushing cycles (0, 100, 1000) and integral relative transmittance loss has been calculated. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed for additional test parameters being type of dust, brush speed and weight. In particular, the type of dust shows a significant influence on the abrasion behavior. Less influential are the brush weight and the speed in the range used here. The dusts used in this setup were Feldspar, Calcite, Corundum and Arizona test dust in different particle size distributions. Using the hard Corundum dust, 1000 brush cycles lead to a relative loss in transmittance of about 3%. The application potential of the presented linear abrasion test for quality assessment and benchmarking of commercial glass coatings will be discussed. In particular, the implementation of region-specific test dusts in laboratory test procedures is of high interest for further standardization activities.

Abstract: Flat plate solar collectors face the problem of overheating and the ensuing high thermal stresses and general collector damage lead to high maintenance costs. To address this challenge, absorber coatings with a passive optical switch at critically high operating temperatures are proposed. The remarkable near- and mid-infrared spectral modulation of thermochromic VO2 makes it a promising material for smart selective absorbers with temperature dependent optical selectivity. Single VO2 films readily achieve thermal emittance modulations of 40% points (p.p.) at a phase transition temperature of 66 °C. With 5 at.% Ge added to the VO2 thin film, the transition temperature is increased to 82 °C. When VO2 and VO2:Ge films are combined with a selective CuCoMnOx layer and an SiO2 top layer, a thermal emittance modulation of 31 p.p. and 33 p.p. is retained, respectively. However, a simultaneous increase of the solar absorptance αsol by 7 p.p. and 5 p.p. limits the drop in collector efficiency at elevated temperatures. Simulations show that adding an absorber layer between the Al substrate and thermochromic VO2, decreasing solar absorptance over the phase transition is achieved. In line with these findings, a TiAlSiN//VO2:Ge//SiO2 multilayer is prepared. Below the phase transition temperature, the efficiency of the thermochromic collector is similar to that of standard collectors. At the transition temperature, αsol decreases from 0.93 to 0.91 and ϵth increases from 0.08 to 0.24. Such a decrease in αsol accompanied by an increase in εth for increasing temperature has been achieved for the first time. The subsequent drop in selectivity, limits the maximum stagnation temperature of the thermochromic collector to 160 °C, 17 °C lower than for a standard collector in identical conditions. The absorber durability is confirmed through accelerated aging tests in dry and humid conditions alike.

Abstract: Abstract
The present study is a 4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental) analysis of a nanofluid-based parabolic trough collector (PTC) which is conducted with a developed model in MATLAB. MXene (Ti3C2) nanoparticles were added to the silicon oil at weight concentrations of 0.05, 0.08, and 0.1%. The result was the important enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid on the rand of 70%–89% for the highest concentration. According to the results, the PTC's optical efficiency was estimated at 79%, while thermal and exergy efficiencies of 74.71% and 22.44% with 0.10 wt% concentration were recorded on July 17, 2019. It is found that the MXene based silicone oil can reduce the system's cost by 0.021 M$ and enhance the energy gained by 1.51% at 0.10 wt% concentration compared to pure oil. Also, the annual CO2 mitigation from the energy side varies from 2.25 to 2.30-ton CO2/year, while the annual environmental gain ranged between 32.73 and 33.28 $/year and 9.065 to 9.102 $/year for the energy and exergy studies respectively.

Abstract: Nanofluids show great interest in the direct absorption solar collector (DASC) due to their excellent optical, thermal, and flow properties. However, the stability of nanofluid in the terms of the long period and the working temperature has limited its commercial application in DASCs. In this work, ultra-stable carbon quantum dot (CQD) nanofluids were prepared by microwave heating polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG-200), which shows excellent stability over a long period (such as 30 days) and repeatable performance at the working temperature. The solar thermal conversion efficiency η increases with extending the microwave duration t, and η can reach 81% at 1 sun and t = 24 min, which is triple the base fluid PEG-200 (η = 27%). In addition, the solar intensity and working temperature have little effect on η due to the ultra-stability of CQD nanofluids. Finally, η can be further enhanced by changing the base fluid or mixing with the plasmonic nanofluids. These results show that the CQD nanofluids can be a potential working fluid used in solar thermal applications.

Abstract: Molten salts are ideal high-temperature thermal energy storage materials for solar energy generation; however, disadvantages such as leakage, corrosive behavior, and low thermal conductivity limit their widespread application. The use of ceramic skeletons to encapsulate molten salts by the mixing-sintering method is a promising approach to overcome the above shortcomings. However, the CPCMs fabricated by the mixing-sintering method usually have high porosity and are easily deformed at temperatures above the melting point of the loaded salt. In this study, two solid wastes, ferrotitanium slag and waste glass, were first used as skeleton materials to encapsulate molten Na2SO4–NaCl salt; herein, waste glass was also introduced as a modifier to promote the sinterability and thermal stability of the CPCMs. The results demonstrated that the waste glass addition not only improved the sinterability via the viscous flow mechanism but also enhanced the compressive strength, thermal conductivity, thermal cycling stability, and high-temperature structural stability of the CPCMs. Additionally, ferrotitanium slag had good compatibility with the Na2SO4–NaCl salt. The waste glass reacted with the molten salt to form a new compound, (Na0.8Ca0.1)2SO4. Although the synthesis of (Na0.8Ca0.1)2SO4 increased the melting temperature of the CPCMs by 3–4 °C, it improved the melting enthalpy of the CPCMs that was beneficial for compensating the salt loss during thermal cycling. In summary, an eco-friendly and low-cost thermal energy storage material was developed in this study, and more importantly, a promising approach to improve the sinterability and thermal stability of CPCMs was proposed.

Abstract: This experimental work reports the activities of design, fabrication and characterization of an innovative solid-state electrochromic device, deposited on a single substrate with high transparency in the bleached conditions and a wide modulation of transmittance (ΔT of 60% at 750 nm) both in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. A tailored formulation of the solid electrolytes, based on sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer-copolymer dispersions and the accurate design of a suitable layer of porous tin oxide nanoparticles provided high coloration and bleaching kinetics and recovery of the pristine conditions, even after 500 complete cycles. Devices were scaled-up to 10 × 10 cm2 size, without mechanical and aesthetic defects and relevant homogeneity, throughout the coloration and bleaching processes. Furthermore, this device shows the further feature to be a low-emissivity dynamic solar control film, highly compatible with integration within insulated glazed units.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we review the role of selective emitters and filter materials in designs for thermophotovoltaics. After a brief review of the basics of thermophotovoltaics, we present a detailed discussion of options for highly-selective thermal emitters, highly-selective filters, and the interactions between them. We present a comprehensive analysis of 26 state-of-the-art selective emitters and discuss the particular advantages of each type of design strategy. We then discuss the fundamentals of materials stability, and how they can inform multilayer designs. We summarize the major challenges of current thermophotovoltaics with comparison to other competing energy conversion technologies. We then conclude with a summary and future perspectives on the prospects for highly-selective thermal emitters and filters.

Abstract: While bifacial p-type silicon (p-Si) passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) have dominated the current photovoltaic industry, potential-induced degradation (PID), especially in the rear-side, has become a big issue in their practical applications. Here, we have investigated the impact of different rear passivation layers on the anti-PID and electrical property of bifacial p-Si PERCs. Both simulation and characterization showed that the introduction of SiNx films with a high refractive index and additive oxide films were in favor of reducing the rear PID effect. Finally, we proposed a combined structure of stack films as the rear passivation layer, yielding an absolute front-side and rear-side efficiency improvement of 0.09% and 0.18% with 800 pieces of 166 × 166 mm2 Si wafers on the production line, and the rear PID related power loss dropped from the baseline of 5.46%–1.05% and 5.15%–0.56% by single-cell modules and commercial glass-glass modules, respectively. Together with the well-solved front-side anti-PID technique in industry, the presented novel rear passivation layer establishes a base for the efficient applications of the bifacial p-Si PERCs.

Abstract: By the widely application in solar energy conversion systems for phase change materials (PCM), the photothermal properties of PCM are important for the efficiency of systems. As a typical PCM, the applications of paraffin in solar utilization are limited by it poor photothermal properties. In order to improve the photothermal performance of pure PCM, Zn–TiN binary nanoparticles are chosen for the enhancement in the present work. Furthermore, the photothermal properties of Zn–TiN binary nanoparticles enhanced phase change material (NePCM) with various volume fraction are evaluated by thermal properties, capacity of solar energy absorbed, and photothermal conversion performance. In addition, the stability of NePCM effected by dispersants and the temperature variation regularity of samples effected by solar radiation intensity and temperature monitoring locations are also studied. As the results: CTAB is a suitable dispersant for the NePCM. Under the same concentration (0.001 vol%), Zn–TiN binary nanoparticles can improve the solar absorption capacity of pure PCM significantly which enhanced almost 8 times. However, due to the aggregation of nanoparticles, the efficiency of photothermal conversion decreases with the increase of volume fraction, therefore, 0.001 vol% Zn–TiN binary NePCM gives the maximum efficiency of 22%, that is twice than that of the pure PCM. Photothermal conversion performance improved with the increase of intensity of solar radiation. Under the intensity of 600 W/m2, the peak temperature of 0.01 vol% Zn–TiN binary NePCM is 62.57 °C which appears in the center of the sample.

Abstract: Consideration must be given to both surface passivation and stability for the design of intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) films for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. Although the underdense a-Si:H(i) films could offer outstanding surface passivation and lead to a high cell efficiency, it was hard for such a porous structure to prevent the intrusion of sodium-ion (Na+) and moisture during Na+ aging test, resulting in the serious degradation of cell efficiency. Hence, we replaced the a-Si:H(i) film at the sun side with the a-SiOx:H(i) film and applied 20-s hydrogen plasma treatment to the underdense a-Si:H(i) film at the rear side in order to reduce the porosity of the a-Si:H(i) films without epitaxial growth. Additionally, an 80-nm SiOx layer was capped on the rear side of the optimized SHJ solar cells as a protective layer, leading to a high efficiency of 22.23% and the negligible degradation of only 0.27%abs after 3-h Na+ aging test. This work offers a valid approach to balancing both the high efficiency and high stability of SHJ solar cells, which may guide the optimization of SHJ solar cells for real applications.

Abstract: Radiative cooling technology holds great promise in reducing energy consumptions for cooling and is perceived as a geoengineering approach to fight climate change as well. Stringent requirement on high solar reflectance and high infrared emissivity limits the selections of radiative cooling materials. Here, we developed a thin HDPE porous film with a simple thermal scraping method to act as an optical shield for radiative cooling devices. The polyethylene porous film shows 98.3% solar weighted reflectivity and 92.5% infrared transmittance which is the highest among all the optical shields reported. The film achieved a maximum cooling more than 5 °C under 950 W/m2 direct sunlight without optimizing the infrared emitting material and thermal insulation design. The preparation method has the potential to achieve continuous large-area production and the produced PE porous film will greatly broaden the selections of infrared emitters and provides more freedom for designing even better infrared emitting structures.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) has attracted interest in the last years due to the possibility of attaining high energy densities, seasonal storage capacity and greater efficiencies than currently commercial thermal energy storage systems using molten salts. This work analyses the potential of an ultra-high temperature TCES system based on the SrCO3/SrO system. The process relies upon the reversible decomposition of SrCO3 into SrO and CO2. As proposed in previous works for the integration of the Ca-Looping process to store energy in CSP plants, both the calcination (endothermic) and carbonation (exothermic) reactions are carried out in a closed CO2 loop. At these conditions, the required temperature to attain full calcination in short residence times is around 1400 °C whereas carbonation takes place at about 1200 °C. Using this process, the energy density potentially achievable by the storage material is very high (around 2000 MJ/m3) while the ultra-high carbonation temperature would improve thermoelectric efficiency. The enhancement of the multicycle performance of the SrCO3/SrO system using refractory additives is also explored. Even though current commercial CSP plants with tower technology cannot yet operate at these ultra-high temperatures, recent advances in the development of high-temperature solar receivers could allow operation at 1400 °C in the medium term. Finally, a conceptual model of the integration of the SrCO3/SrO system in a CSP plant supports higher overall efficiency and energy density, but lower solar-to-electric efficiency due to thermal losses.

In the first part of the study, we develop a hole-selective contact based on thin ALD vanadium oxide (V2O5) layers without using an amorphous silicon interlayer. The ALD process has been optimised, i.e. number of ALD cycles and deposition temperature, as a trade-off between surface passivation and contact resistivity. Noticeable surface passivation with recombination current densities around 100 fA/cm2, as well as reasonable contact resistivity values below 250 mΩcm2 are reached using 200 ALD V2O5 cycles deposited at a deposition temperature of 125 °C (∼10 nm layer thickness). The optimised ALD V2O5-based contact is combined with both an ALD TiO2-based electron-selective contact and an excellent surface passivation in non-contacted regions provided by ALD Al2O3 films, to form a fully ALD IBC c-Si(n) solar cell scheme. Fabricated devices yield photovoltaic efficiencies and pseudo efficiencies, i.e. calculated without series resistance losses, of 18.6% and 21.1% respectively (3 cm × 3 cm device area). These results reveal the potential of the ALD technique to deposit transition metal oxide (TMO) films as selective contacts on high efficiency devices, paving the way of using low thermal-budget, low cost and highly scalable processes for a highly demanding IBC solar cell architecture in the photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Ceramic-based packed bed solutions are becoming more common in the energy fields as both thermal energy storage and heat exchanger. Such solutions are usually designed for the working temperature ranges above 600 °C, thus thermal radiation becomes significant and even acts as the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Therefore, applying high-temperature coatings with different thermal properties could be an efficient way in enhancing the performance of these applications. In this work, the high-temperature long residency and cyclic thermal stability of six inorganic coatings applied on a ceramic substrate are investigated. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments are performed. The results show that HIE-Coat 840MX and Pyropaint 634 ZO exhibit excellent thermal stability performance both at high-temperature testing (1000 °C) and under thermal cycle testing (400 °C–800 °C). TiO2 based coatings could be a viable solution if the powder is pre-treated to avoid polymorph transition during the operation. Stainless steel 304 powder-based coating could also be a possible solution, since the adhesive curbs the oxidation and hinders the coating from deterioration. Contrarily, Pyromark 2500 and MgO based coating show different degradation problems that limit their exploitation in high-temperature applications undergoing thermal cycles. The investigated coatings show a wide range of thermal emissivity (between 0.6 and 0.9), with stable or decreasing trends with temperature. This enables a potential 20% change of the effective thermal conductivity for the packing structure. This work is a stepping-stone towards further detailed experimental studies on the influence of coatings on various packed bed thermal storage systems, and thus offer a new option in improving the performances of the energy equipment with packed bed systems.

Abstract: In the present work investigations on the morphological, structural, optoelectronic, and photoelectrochemical properties of Cu2O were carried out in detail at various deposition pH values. It was observed that Cu2O maintained the polycrystalline nature and exhibited (111) plane dominance irrespective of the deposition pH. Using the Debye-Scherrer equation and the Williamson-Hall method, the crystallite size and intrinsic lattice strain were observed to decrease with increase in the deposition pH. The crystal shapes were noticed to transform from three-sided pyramids to three-faced prisms and eventually to four-faced pyramids with the increase in bath pH from 5 to 10. Films deposited at lower pH were thicker and showed higher light absorption, and the bandgaps were tunable from 2.03 eV to 2.19 eV. The type of electronic conductivity was tuned from n-type to p-type at the pH of 7, and the flatband potential showed variation from −0.16 V to 0.27 V as the deposition pH was increased. The cathodic photocurrent-density increased as the deposition pH increased from pH 7 to 8 and then decreased after the pH of 8 due to a possible competition between the charge-recombination and charge-migration.

Abstract: The removal of antibiotics from water using solar (visible) light catalytic technology has the advantages of high efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness. The bismuth tungstate semiconductor catalyst Bi2WO6 exhibits superior performance; however, further research is required to elucidate its synergistic catalytic effects and to better understand its adsorption performance. Herein, a series of modified bismuth tungstate catalysts were prepared by introducing various dispersants. Advanced characterization methods were employed to reveal the structure and composition of the Bi2WO6 catalyst, and the preparation conditions of modified Bi2WO6 were optimized by investigating the adsorption and photocatalytic properties of the catalysts. The synergistic effects of catalyst adsorption and visible light catalysis significantly enhanced the removal of tetracycline through a mechanism whereby the pollutants were enriched on the surface of the catalyst owing to its superior adsorption capacity; this provided a sufficient reaction microenvironment for photocatalytic degradation. The catalyst was loaded onto a sponge surface and subjected to continuous-stream catalysis in a reactor for the degradation of tetracycline-containing wastewater (influent pollutant concentration = 0.8 mg/L). This sponge-loaded Bi2WO6 catalyst was used with a dosage of 0.6 g/L under a light source intensity of 140000 Lux and illumination for 2-h intervals. A hydraulic retention time (HRT) of more than 6 h was observed, and the system achieved a degradation efficiency for trace tetracycline up to 97%, while exhibiting good operational effects after continuous operation for 12 d.

Abstract: Despite the growing recognition that gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and occurs as a major prodromal symptom of PD, its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Among the various types of GI cells, enteric glial cells (EGCs), which resemble astrocytes in structure and function, play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many GI diseases including PD. Thus, we investigated how EGCs respond to the environmental pesticides rotenone (Rot) and tebufenpyrad (Tebu) in cell and animal models to better understand the mechanism underlying GI abnormalities. Both Rot and Tebu induce dopaminergic neuronal cell death through complex 1 inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We report that exposing a rat enteric glial cell model (CRL-2690 cells) to these pesticides increased mitochondrial fission and reduced mitochondrial fusion by impairing MFN2 function. Furthermore, they also increased mitochondrial superoxide generation and impaired mitochondrial ATP levels and basal respiratory rate. Measurement of LC3, p62 and lysosomal assays revealed impaired autolysosomal function in ECGs during mitochondrial stress. Consistent with our recent findings that mitochondrial dysfunction augments inflammation in astrocytes and microglia, we found that neurotoxic pesticide exposure also enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory factors in EGCs in direct correlation with the loss in mitochondrial mass. Finally, we show that pesticide-induced mitochondrial defects functionally impaired smooth muscle velocity, acceleration, and total kinetic energy in a mixed primary culture of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Collectively, our studies demonstrate for the first time that exposure to environmental neurotoxic pesticides impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and activates inflammatory pathways in EGCs, further augmenting mitochondrial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory events to induce gut dysfunction. Our findings have major implications in understanding the GI-related pathogenesis and progression of environmentally linked PD.

Abstract: To build an affordable photoelectrochromic energy conversion unit for self-powered smart window applications, the attractive multi-color Ag/V2O5 electrochromic counter electrode (CE) is coupled with a co-sensitized photoanode TiO2/CdS/PbS. V2O5 based devices are well-known for providing smart solutions when a voltage is applied but in this kind of configuration, the quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSC) drives the chromatic switching, with sunlight as the natural stimulus. The key objective in coating silver nanowires (AgNW) over the V2O5 film is to enhance the electrochromic as well as electrochemical performance of the device. AgNW impart good electrical conductivity to the layered V2O5 structure making it a promising CE and the transparency of the hybrid film in the visible-light region together with the plasmonic effect contributes to a better optical contrast. The PECD with Ag/V2O5 CE shows a transmission modulation (ΔT) of 31.1% with 45.8 cm2 C-1 coloration efficiency, which is significantly improved than with just V2O5. As compared to the liquid junction photoelectrochromic assembly, the individual films have a much higher ΔT (45.1% at 655 nm). The 5.21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the TiO2/CdS/PbS−S2−−Ag/V2O5 QDSC based PECD is a marked rise over that without both AgNW in the CE and PbS near infrared light harvesting QDs at the anode. This work attempts a detailed analysis of the photoelectrochromic and photovoltaic outputs of this novel PECD design with the hybrid film.

Abstract: Tungsten oxide (WO3) photochromic film for smart windows faces many challenges, including slight discoloration, and slow and irreversible photochromic response. We propose a WO3 quantum dots (WQDs) to resolve the above problems, and WQDs-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) transparent film by casting method exhibits quick response to ultraviolet light (<60 s), and large optical modulation (>90%) between bleached and colored states, although the bleaching time is still long (8 h). Meanwhile, the PVA/WQDs composite film is self-supported and exhibits excellent tensile properties. The actual cooling effect of the photochromic glass was tested using a model house and the annual energy consumption was simulated by using EnergyPlus software. For a warm city (Haikou), using this photochromic glass can reduce electrical consumption for cooling by 27.3%.

Abstract: This article provides an in-depth review of charge transport models utilized to analyze the performance of near-field thermophotovoltaic (NF-TPV) devices, and a comprehensive examination of NF-TPV experiments performed to date. Researchers have used several models to theoretically analyze NF-TPV devices; however, each model can result in different performances of NF-TPV devices, particularly due to characteristics of near-field thermal radiation. For clarification, we sort up-to-date analysis models into four categories; the analytical approximation model, detailed balance analysis, minority carrier separation (MCS) model, and Poisson-drift–diffusion (PDD) model. Key assumptions of each model are enumerated, and the calculated results by each model are compared. For the review of experimental works, we first sort NF-TPV experiments according to the manner of gap control into positioner-, spacer-, and MEMS-based approaches. Then, we introduce the primary design configuration of each approach and the compelling experimental results achieved by state-of-the-art studies. In addition, advanced concepts of hybrid devices and multi-junction PV cells, proposed to further improve NF-TPV performance, are briefly introduced.

Abstract: When molten salt is used as a high-temperature heat carrier or electrolyte solution, the corrosion of molten salt is necessary to be studied regarding the device's safety. In this work, a cellular automata method is used to simulate the corrosion behaviour of alloys in ternary molten salt of NaCl–KCl–ZnCl2. The CA method described in this paper can be used to reproduce the distribution of corrosion products and components and the change in morphology and thickness of the corrosion layer in the phase of high-temperature corrosion, which provides a unique insight into the corrosion behaviour of chloride molten salt over time. In addition, we also consider the pitting corrosion that may occur during the corrosion process. Furthermore, the applicability of the model can predict the corrosion behaviour of different metals in molten chloride salt.

Abstract: Easy freezing and overheating of the flat panel solar collector (FPSC) limits its large-scale application. In addition to the characteristics of high heat storage density and low price, inorganic supercooling phase change materials (PCMs) also have a large difference between their melting and freezing points, which fully meets the needs of FPSCs. In this paper, a new type of supercooled PCM as an FPSC was designed and studied, and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was verified by experiments. Simulations were done to analyze the effects of different structures and PCM properties on the thermal efficiency and cooling rate of the collector. The results showed that the efficiency increase rate of the absorber plate was about 15% when the absorber plate was in direct contact with the PCM under neutralization. For the PCM with a melting point of 323.15 K and a supercooling degree of 30 K, the increase rate of the cooling time can reach more than 15% compared with that of a non-supercooled PCM. The structure of FPSC was optimized, and the thickness of PCM was studied in typical geographic areas. Except for Chengdu, the reliability index of the supercooled phase change material FPSC (SPCM-FPSC) in winter and summer was found to increase to more than 0.5 compared with 0.1 for ordinary FPSCs. It was found that the SPCM-FPSC significantly improved the freezing and high-temperature resistance of collectors in various regions. These results provide a strategy for the promotion and application of FPSCs in harsh outdoor environments.

Abstract: Incoming radiation energy illuminating a solar cell contains a certain amount of entropy, which does not contribute to output electrical work. Entropy has a different spectral distribution from the internal energy of light and consequently affects PV cell performance. Here in this work, we investigate the influence of entropy content of thermally radiated light on the maximum achievable efficiency of single-junction solar cells. We revise the value of the well-known Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit for various absorber materials and take a deeper look at this effect by re-calculating the efficiency limit of crystalline silicon solar cells considering Meitner-Auger recombination. When considering the entropy content of AM 1.5 standard spectrum, the SQ limit for silicon drops from 33.15% to 30.42%. Further, considering Meitner-Auger recombination and using measured properties of silicon, the efficiency limit lowers to 27.12% from the already established 29.43%. This suggests a 4% thinner silicon absorber, reaching a thickness of ∼101 μm; hinting PV industry that a thinner Si wafer can provide the optimum outdoor energy yield. We further show that the entropy content of terrestrial radiation is less in favor of c-Si technology and most in favor of amorphous silicon. In the end, we discuss a few applications of considering entropy of incoming sunlight for photovoltaics, which range from PV device design to PV module tilt optimization and even PV system electrical standards.

Abstract: A novel organic silicon microencapsulated phase change materials (OS-MPCMs) was successfully designed and prepared via single-step in-situ polymerization. OS-MPCMs with n-ocadecane as core material and silicone as shell material, has excellent latent heat storage and release performance (ΔHm = 103.3J/g, ΔHc = 104.5J/g), excellent thermal stability and cycle durability of at least 200 cycles, as well as remarkable mechanical properties. The effects of core/shell ratio on morphology, thermal properties, thermal stability and mechanical properties of OS-MPCMs were further investigated. The experimental scheme was optimized and adjusted to ensure that OS-MPCMs could adapt to a more complex environment. In this study, the single-step in-situ polymerization method was adopted to simplify the synthesis process, and the self-assembly of microcapsules could be completed through one feeding. At the same time, OS-MPCMs encapsulation efficiency is improved, up to 86.45%. The raw materials used in production are simple and easy to obtain, and the production process is green and environmentally friendly. The excellent performance and simple production mode makes OS-MPCMs have an unexceptionable application prospect in the energy storage fields of energy-efficient building, thermo-regulated fabrics and so on.

Abstract: Nanoscale V2O5 films possess excellent electrochemical properties and have great potential for application in electrochromic devices. Herein, we report a novel strategy for the transformation of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous(3DOM) V2O5 films into V2O5 nanorods film using a simple low-temperature annealing treatment, in which the heterogeneous nucleation sites provided by PS colloidal sphere surface, the anisotropic bonding of V2O5, atomic rearrangement, and Ostwald ripening are all important factors affecting the morphological transformation. According to this study, during the preparation of 3DOM V2O5 films, a small number of oxygen vacancies were introduced into the V2O5 lattice, and the annealing treatment (250–400 °C, 4–8 h) controlled the concentration of oxygen vacancies. Compared with the ion storage capacity of V2O5 films prepared by conventional sol-gel dip-coating method (17.79 mC cm−2 for unannealed V2O5 films and 13.90 mC cm−2 for V2O5 films after 6 h of annealing at 350 °C), the 350°C-6h films with nanorod structure had the highest ion-storage performance, the initial value raised to 98.77 mC cm−2. Further, the cycling stability was excellent, with only a 6.1% decrease after 5000 cycles. This was because of the special nanorod structure and the presence of a certain number of gradient oxygen vacancies in the 350°C-6h film. The 350°C-6h film also had good electrochromic properties, a wide range of transmittance modulation (73.6%), and a fast response time (3.2 s for coloring and 3.9 s for bleaching). In addition, electrochromic devices (ECDs) with 350°C-6h films as both ion-storage layers and electrochromic layers have been successfully assembled, which exhibit high performance.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) behaviors of poly-viologens are tuned by selecting positions (ortho (o), meta (m), and para (p)) of the benzene rings linked to 4,4′-bipyridine. All-in-one type EC devices (ECDs) are conveniently fabricated by adding poly-viologens to highly conductive solid-state polymeric gel electrolytes. The maximum transmittance contrast (ΔT) of the o-poly-viologen based ECD is much lower than that of the other isomers, and its bleaching is not reversible, whereas a large ΔT and high stability are achieved with the m- and p-poly-viologens. Considering the high solubility of the m-poly-viologen in ion gels, it is anticipated to have a larger hydrodynamic size, leading to low diffusivity (∼1.1 × 10−12 cm2/s for cationic and ∼2.7 × 10−12 cm2/s for anionic current). As a result, the m-poly-viologen ECD shows a superior memory effect and long-lasting colored state without voltage supply. This feature allows us to demonstrate a low-power ECD based on the m-poly-viologen, which only requires ∼3.54 μW/cm2 to maintain the transmittance below 30%. The results indicate that adjusting the isomeric molecular structure of poly-viologen EC chromophores is an effective way to control their EC performance.

Abstract: Defects at the surface of perovskite films are considered as the main origins of efficiency loss and instability, which has severely limited the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel functional ionic compound, guanidinium tetrafluoroborate (GuaBF4), is introduced into the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) interface for the surface defect passivation of perovskite films. Thanks to the synergistic effect of Gua+ and BF4−, the GuaBF4 surface treatment can endow the MAPbI3 film with larger grains, smoother surface, higher crystallinity, efficiently-passivated surface defects and optimized interfacial energy level alignment. Meanwhile, systematical optical and electrical studies have demonstrated that the GuaBF4 surface treatment can suppress trap-assisted carrier recombination loss and reduce the charge accumulation at the MAPbI3/PC61BM interface, thus promoting charge carrier transport and extraction. Based on the GuaBF4 surface treatment, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices increases from 18.09% to 20.54% for small devices (active area 0.10 cm2) and from 12.35% to 15.52% for large devices (active area 1.0 cm2). Moreover, PSCs undergone GuaBF4 surface treatment display the reduced hysteresis behavior, increased moisture stability and high reproducibility. Our work provides a new surface treatment approach by functional ionic compounds for passivating surface-defects, thus achieving high-performance PSCs.

Abstract: Dual-band electrochromic smart windows can dynamically and independently control near infrared (NIR) and visible (Vis) light, and are considered a promising technology for improving building energy efficiency. However, most existing dual band electrochromic materials consist of complex nanocomposites, and it is difficult to balance the delicate composition of each constituent. Recently, to solve these problems, research has been conducted on single component dual-band electrochromic materials, in particular, oxygen deficient tungsten oxide (WO3-x) nanostructures. In this study, WO3-x nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple solvothermal method, and highly dispersible inks were formulated which could be deposited at relatively low temperature via various solution-based coating methods. Various analysis techniques including XRD, HR-TEM and in-situ spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed that the oxygen-deficient WO3-x composition remained intact up to an annealing temperature of 350 °C. Under suitable thermal treatment conditions, the resulting WO3-x films could independently and dynamically control NIR and VIS light transmittance. When a moderate voltage of −0.4 V was applied, the NIR light was mainly blocked via a capacitive charge mechanism, with optical modulations of 23.81% and 72.48% at 550 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. A further increase in applied voltage to −1.2 V led to the blocking of both VIS and NIR light through faradaic Li+ ion insertion with optical modulations of 71.13% and 84.57% at 550 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. Moreover, the optical modulations were maintained for 1000 consecutive cycles. This work demonstrates a single component dual-band electrochromic material that can be useful for various applications such as electrochromic smart windows.

Abstract: Quasi-steady-state photoconductance is commonly used for measuring the effective lifetime of excess carriers in silicon wafers. A known artifact, unrelated to the sample's lifetime in eddy current based photoconductance measurements, is a strong increase in lifetime at low carrier densities. It is commonly observed in multicrystalline and cast-mono crystalline silicon. This artifact is often attributed to bulk defects changing their charge state and is referred to as trapping. In this work, we investigate an alternative interpretation for materials with crystallographic defects. In this interpretation, the trapping-like behavior is caused by local changes in the Fermi energy level at grain boundaries (compared to the bulk crystal), along with the substantial movement of the majority carriers’ quasi Fermi energy level during the photoconductance measurement. Using cast-mono wafers, we observe a variation in trapping signals and dark conductance that correlates with grain boundaries. We show that the trapping-like behavior in these regions can be explained by a change in electrostatic potential barrier heights at different illumination intensities and in the dark, impacting eddy currents. This should be considered when using eddy current based methods for characterization of multicrystalline and cast-mono silicon wafers.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) have developed as an environmental-friendly photoactive materials for low-cost photovoltaics due to its non-toxic elements and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, chemical bath deposited (CBD) CdS thin film was generally employed as electron transport layer (ETL) in substrate or superstrate structured Sb2Se3 solar cells, which was still a huge concern restraining its long-term advancement. In this work, we have replaced the toxic CdS film by employing ZnSnO films fabricated through magnetron co-sputtering technique to develop Cd-free ZnSnO/Sb2Se3 solar cells. It was observed that Sn/(Zn + Sn) in ZnSnO film affecting the energy band alignment with Sb2Se3 take part in improving the device efficiency. Substrate structured Cd-free Sb2Se3 based devices with a champion device performance of 3.44%, were firstly made with the optimized Zn0.57Sn0.43O buffer layer closely related to the rational band alignment, the reduced recombination losses at interface (ZnSnO/Sb2Se3), and efficient charge transfer. This substituted sputtering ZnSnO for CBD-CdS film demonstrated remarkable potential to efficient and Cd-free Sb2Se3 solar cell with full-vacuum process.

Abstract: This work develops metallic wood-based phase change materials (MWPCM) with high-performance anisotropic thermal conductivity by impregnating wood with phase change microcapsules and subsequent in situ chemical deposition of copper inside the wood cell lumen. Phase change material (PCM) is encapsulated by polymer to form phase change microcapsules, which solve the leakage problem effectively. Benefited with the well-aligned and hierarchical porous structure of wood, phase change microcapsules coated with copper layer are orderly confined inside wood vessels and fibers, developing a continuous and anisotropic heat transfer network along the highly oriented transport tissues of wood. The morphology, chemical structure and crystallization of microcapsules and MWPCM are investigated using scanning electronic microscope (SEM), flourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and the thermal storage capacity, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of the developed PCM composites are examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and laser flash diffusivity apparatus (LFA) respectively. The results show that PCM capsules were effectively accommodated in orderly porous wood as a carrier; the radial and longitudinal thermal conductivity of MWPCM reached 0.37 W/(m*K) and 0.53 W/(m*K), which increased by 362% and 211% compared to pure wood, respectively. The anisotropic thermal conductivity of MWPCM enabled an efficient heat transfer along the longitudinal direction and reduced the heat loss in the transverse direction. MWPCM exhibited good thermal energy storage capacity (92.9 J/g and 94.6 J/g) and suitable phase change temperature (11.4 °C and 29.4 °C) for indoor thermal energy management. MWPCM also displayed outstanding shape-stability, excellent thermal stability and temperature regulation, which has a great potential for building energy collecting, storage and management.

Abstract: In this work, the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells was modified to improve carrier transport while maintaining excellent passivation of the c-Si absorber surface. The microstructure of different multilayer intrinsic a-Si:H films was measured and its influence on contact resistance and passivation quality was investigated thoroughly. We show that a pronounced trade-off between passivation and transport exists and that this trade-off is governed by the a-Si:H properties close to the c-Si surface. The fact that the same trend was observed for hole and electron contact suggests that the transport barrier formed by the interfacial a-Si:H layer is governed by a higher resistivity of the void-rich interfacial layer or a less pronounced induced junction and not by asymmetric hole or electron barriers (band offsets, tunnel efficiencies, …). Modified intrinsic layers have been tested on cell level, resulting in a series resistance (Rs) reduction by about 0.3 Ωcm2 and an increase in fill factor (FF) by roughly 1.0 %abs. The power conversion efficiency (η) was improved by about 0.3 %abs with respect to our baseline. Further, the beneficial effect of a hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) on passivation and transport of the hole contact was shown on device level.

Abstract: Spectral-selectively solar harvest is achieved in designated frequency regions for photothermal energy generation. In this study, we have designed and synthesized porphyrin-based hybrids that typically exhibit two absorption peaks respectively near 400 nm (blue-violet) and 700 nm (NIR). To be able to tune the optical absorptions for more efficient solar harvest especially in the IR region, unique porphyrin hybrids are developed by incorporating another porphyrin compound such as phthalocyanine, and inorganic Fe3O4@Cu2-xS nanoparticles with different absorption characteristics. By controlling the ratio of the components, the hybrids exhibit gradual and consistent changes in the optical spectra, showing high spectral tunability. Transparent thin films of the hybrids are deposited on glass substrates and assembled in parallel for 3D solar harvesting in a cuboid photothermal generator. Solar light is able to pass through the multilayers of thin films, generating significant thermal heat on each one for enhanced energy density. The structural features of the hybrids are well correlated to the optical behaviors based on Raman studies. Also discussed is the operating mechanisms underlying the photothermal behaviors associated with the hybrid structures.

Abstract: Fascin is the main actin-bundling protein in filopodia and is highly expressed in metastatic tumor cells. The overexpression of Fascin has been associated with poor clinical prognosis and metastatic progression. Post-translational modifications of Fascin, such as phosphorylation, can affect the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells by regulating the actin-bundling activity of Fascin. However, the phosphorylation sites of Fascin and their corresponding kinases require further exploration. In the current study, we identified novel phosphorylation of Fascin Threonine 403 (Fascin-T403) mediated by AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2), which was studied using mass spectrometry data from esophageal cancer tissues (iProX database: IPX0002501000). A molecular dynamics simulation revealed that Fascin-Threonine 403 phosphorylation (Fascin-T403D) had a distinct spatial structure and correlation of amino acid residues, which was different from that of the wild type (Fascin-WT). Low-speed centrifugation assay results showed that Fascin-T403D affected actin cross-linking. To investigate whether Fascin-T403D affected the function of esophageal cancer cells, either Fascin-WT or Fascin-T403D were rescued in Fascin-knockout or siRNA cell lines. We observed that Fascin-T403D could suppress the biological behavior of esophageal cancer cells, including filopodia formation, cell proliferation, and migration. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) were performed to measure the interaction between Fascin and AKT2. Using in vitro and in vivo kinase assays, we confirmed that AKT2, but not AKT1 or AKT3, is an upstream kinase of Fascin Threonine 403. Taken together, the AKT2-catalyzed phosphorylation of Fascin Threonine 403 suppressed esophageal cancer cell behavior, actin-bundling activity, and filopodia formation.

Abstract: Micro-concentrator photovoltaics (micro-CPV) consists of the reduction in size of the components of the conventional concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) technology, attaining equally high efficiencies and reducing material costs and manufacturing costs. In this publication we focus on the implementation of high throughput manufacturing methods for the interconnection of solar cells. The goal is to enable large area interconnection of thousands of micro-solar cells with a low cost of 3 €/m2. A first prototype was manufactured, interconnecting multiple 1 mm2 solar cells via directly printing onto the front contact pads. The result is a glass substrate, with a size of 190 × 145 mm2, with a fully printed circuit interconnecting 12 rows each containing 11 multijunction solar cells in parallel. The fill factor (FF) of the full board is 76% at 214 suns.

Abstract: The determination of the optical properties of encapsulant for photovoltaic modules is essential for cell-to-module (CTM) performance analysis, UV-durability studies and as input parameters of modelling tools. Some innovative polymer encapsulants used in heterojunction module manufacturing, such as polyolefin elastomer or thermoplastic polyolefin, show a non-negligible optical scattering behaviour in addition to refraction and absorption mechanisms, making challenging the extraction of optical properties in general, and optical indices in particular. In this work, a 4-flux optical model was applied on total and diffuse transmittance and reflectance measurements of a Thermoplastic PolyOlefin (TPO) encapsulant layer to extract values of refractive index, absorption, scattering coefficient and anisotropy coefficient of scattered light. This model was found mandatory to obtain a satisfactory fitting and plausible value of the optical parameters, in opposition to simpler models based on collimated light, or only diffuse light, or isotropic 4-flux model. The model was applied on two diffusive TPO: a low and a high UV cut-off. The absorption was found respectively to be 1.7% and 3.8%. Therefore, a new Cell-To-Module source of loss was identified, induced by the backscattered light in the encapsulant bulk, whose value is near 0.8% of the incoming light in both samples.

Abstract: Photothermal conversion applications of solar energy are attracting more and more interests nowadays, and perfect absorption of solar energy by metamaterials is a key point for such a phenomenon. In the present study, we propose a nearly perfect solar absorber with double nested rings respectively made of platinum (Pt) and nickel (Ni) periodically arranged on a gold substrate. We theoretically and numerically discuss the underlying mechanisms of the optical properties for such a multi-materials absorber submerged in water by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The effects of material composition, height and radius of the nano-rings, the thickness of the gold substrate and alumina dielectric layer on the optical property of our proposed absorber are numerically analyzed. The absorptance of such a multi-materials absorber is higher than 96% in the whole wavelength range of 300–2400 nm, which accounts for almost the whole solar spectrum. Moreover, the solar absorber is insensitive to polarization while slightly sensitive to the incident angle of the light. Our solar absorber provides a new approach for the solar energy harvesting and photothermal conversion applications in water, such as solar vapor generation, sterilization, and so on.

Abstract: Thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) in salt hydrates attracts increasing interest due to the high energy density combined with loss-free storage. Strontium bromide hexahydrate (SBH), and composites thereof, are often suggested as suitable materials for this application. Although many aspects of SBH composites have been thoroughly investigated, very little has been done on the fundamental aspects of the hydration reaction and interactions between composite components on a molecular level. In this paper, we examine the interaction between SBH and polymeric additives polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDAC), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and polyacrylic acid (PAA) in previously developed TCHS composites. The primary function of the polymeric additives is enhanced mechanical integrity however this study investigates potential implications on reaction temperature and speed the addition of such components might have. Focus is given to the interaction between SrBr2 and PDAC since such composites showed (de)hydration behaviour deviating from pure SrBr2. The reaction kinetics are investigated at several points in the phase diagram through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), supplemented by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Our findings show that there exists an interaction between SrBr2 and PDAC which manifests itself through shrinkage of crystallite size and increased lattice strain induced by preferential binding of PDAC to SrBr2. Depending on the PDAC content in the composite we have found out that 1) at excessive amounts PDAC inhibits hydration due to its sequestering properties 2) at low amounts it an enhances reaction kinetics due its hydrophilic nature.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power generators offer great possibilities for thermal energy conversion when thermal sources with temperatures nearing or exceeding 1000 K are available. While the power density of conventional TPV systems is generally determined by Planck’s law in the far field, their fundamental performance is known to be dramatically affected by near field effects between the thermal emitter and the photovoltaic cell. Another potentially disruptive enhancement to the performance may be reached by transforming the thermal emitter to exploit electroluminescence. Taking advantage of an electroluminescent emitter as the source of radiation fundamentally alters the thermodynamics of the system. This allows boosting the achievable power densities by orders of magnitude, and also provides access to electroluminescent coolers, thermophotonic (TPX) heat pumps, and TPX power generation devices that can outperform both TPV and thermoelectric heat engines, especially at the low-grade waste heat (LGWH) temperature range (300–500 K) containing in total the majority of recoverable energy. In reality, functional TPX devices are yet to be demonstrated experimentally, due to several material and design bottlenecks. Here, we discuss the thermodynamics, ideal characteristics and advantages of TPX heat engines, and quantify how non-idealities such as non-radiative recombination, optical and resistive losses affect their performance. Our results suggest that, at LGWH temperatures, TPX heat engines start to outperform the best TPV systems when reaching quantum efficiencies of the order of 90%; beyond this threshold, TPX systems become increasingly efficient and powerful.

Abstract: The problem of leakage seriously limits the practical application of phase change materials. For the purpose of improving the thermal energy storage property of composite phase change materials (CPCMs), the composite aerogel of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and e-ZrP (exfoliated from α-ZrP) was formed to encapsulate polyethylene glycol (PEG). It is helpful to fabricate composite aerogel with e-ZrP . The leakage can be prevented by the prepared e-ZrP@PVA aerogel, meanwhile, the CPCMs can keep the shape stabilized during phase change process of PEG. The loading rate of PEG is increased by 5.25% and the relative enthalpy efficiency almost reaches 100% because of the incorporation of e-ZrP. Besides, the CPCMs exhibit considerable phase change enthalpy (158.34 J/g for melting enthalpy and 161.22 J/g for freezing enthalpy). From the above perspectives, the CPCMs have a promising application potential in thermal energy field. And this work also expands the practical usage of ZrP.

Abstract: An effective insulation material that is both thermally and chemically stable in molten salts could transform the design of molten-salt-based thermal energy storage (TES) tanks. Most current molten salt TES tanks hold the metallic tank structure in direct contact with hot salt inventory, a design which leads to thermal expansion of the tank and triggers stresses that can lead to thermomechanical failures. With an internal insulation to lower the temperature at the tank structure, the extent of thermal expansion can be reduced, thereby reducing expansion-induced stresses and allowing for consideration of lower-cost tank structure materials. Conventional insulation materials are either 1) too porous and allow molten salts to permeate into the matrix, which significantly increases the thermal conductivity or 2) too dense and have a thermal conductivity that cannot provide sufficient thermal insulation. This paper presents an alternative thermal insulation concept using cenospheres which have an alumino-silicate structure. The cost analysis suggests that the low-density cenospheres can be one of the cheapest materials to provide cost-effective thermal insulation. The chemical compatibility of cenospheres is investigated in molten 60 wt% NaNO3/40 wt% KNO3 salt which is close to industrial-grade Solar Salt. This paper shows that diffusion of the sodium and potassium cations from the salt into the cenospheres occurs based on weight analysis, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The cation diffusion breaks the bridging oxygen bonds and causes volume expansion of the microstructure which is responsible for the failure of the cenosphere particles. The chemical composition of the cenospheres is found to affect their compatibility with molten nitrate salt. A cenosphere product with low iron content showed the best compatibility with an average survival rate of 77.9% ± 9.8% after 7 days of immersion in the molten nitrate salt. While even the low-iron cenospheres appear to require protection from direct molten salt contact, their slow degradation rate, closed-cell porosity, and low cost hold potential for effective use as internal tank insulation.

Abstract: We investigate bulk and interface recombination in crystalline silicon with p-type fired passivating contacts. These consist of a chemical oxide and an in-situ doped layer of SiCx with low carbon content. Following a rapid thermal annealing to activate the dopants in the SiCx layer, we observe the formation of bulk defect states close to one of the band edges at temperatures between 450 and 700 °C. At temperatures of 800 °C and above, these bulk defects are increasingly cured. At the same time, the surface passivation provided by the interfacial oxide is increasingly deteriorated at temperatures above 800 °C, eventually permitting the injection of a recombination current into the SiCx layer. Consequently, there is a trade-off for the effective minority carrier lifetime with an optimum between 800 and 830 °C. We develop a formalism that distinguishes recombination through shallow bulk defects from the recombination current at the surface in a plot of the effective lifetime τeff over the ratio n/p.

Abstract: This study reports the successful fabrication of Cu@Al2O3 macro-encapsulated metallic PCMs for high-temperature thermal storage over 1000 °C. Cu powders are employed as raw material which are spherulitized to core balls in millimeter-size, and subsequently the core balls are cladded with Al2O3 ceramic shells. After the low-temperature pre-sintering and subsequent high-temperature sintering treatment, the Cu@Al2O3 macrocapsules which contain gaps between the shells and cores are successfully prepared. The core balls are consisted of Cu powders which are not densified but are porous, offering buffer spaces to accommodate the thermal volume expansion during high-temperature sintering and melting of Cu. As a comparison, Cu@Al2O3 macrocapsules prepared by directly coating the commercial solid Cu balls are leaky. Thermal analysis indicates that the metallic core PCM has a melting temperature of 1063 °C and a latent heat of around 210 J/g. The macrocapsules are also highly durable as confirmed by the melting-solidification cycling test.

Abstract: The utilization of aerogel with the 3D network structure is regarded as an important method to construct phase change materials (PCMs). In this work, a series of novel paraffin-based composite PCMs were fabricated with boron nitrid@chitosan aerogel (BNCA) as skeleton materials by a freeze-drying and impregnation method. XRD, SEM, TGA, Hot Disk, DSC and FT-IR were used to character the samples and thermal cycles were employed to measure the shape stability. The results revealed that paraffin wax (PW) had been successful and effectively embedded into the prepared BNCA with a porous structure. Moreover, the morphologies of BNCA/PW composite remained stable after 100 times thermal cycles. In addition, the thermal conductivity of BNCA/PW composite was notably high as 1.14 W/(m·K), which was 4.07 times higher than PW (0.28 W/(m·K)). Simultaneously, the phase temperatures of BNCA/PW composite containing 41 wt% skeleton were 50.5 and 52.9 °C, and its latent heats were 118.4 and 114.9 J/g, respectively. The BNCA/PW composite showed an excellent chemical compatibility between PW and BNCA, and presented broad application prospects in energy storage of electronic systems.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) system is one of the best options for harvesting, storing, and saving energy for long-term or short-term use of a modern energy production system. The nano-enhanced phase change materials (NePCM) are a new type of phase change materials (PCM) formed by suspended nano-sized particles in base PCM to improve the thermophysical properties of the base PCM. The major challenge in nanoparticle dispersion in PCM, especially for solar energy applications, is its poor thermal conductivity and light transmission capability. Present research aims to address the thermal conductivity and light transmission capability issues by dispersing pristine multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (FMWCNT) particles in various weight concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0%) into the salt hydrate PCM. A two-step technique was implemented to develop the NePCM for various weight percentage of MWCNT and FMWCNT. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum shows the MWCNT and FMWCNT nano-sized particles physically mixed well in salt hydrate PCM and without disturbing the chemical properties. The thermal conductivity of developed composites at 0.7 wt% MWCNT/S50 (S50M-0.7) and 0.7 wt% FMWCNT/S50 (S50F-0.7) are 0.78 W/mK, and 0.92 W/mK, respectively. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) results revealed that the maximum improvement in latent heat by 14.66% and 31.17% for 0.1 wt% MWCNT/S50 (S50M-0.1) and 0.3 wt% FMWCNT/S50 (S50F-0.3) respectively. Light transmittance of S50M-0.7 and S50F-0.7 reduced to 92% and 93.49% than pure salt hydrate PCM. It exhibits the reduction in transmittance, greater improvement in solar spectrum absorption, and excellent photothermal conversion.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly common malignancy, being the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that carcinogenic effect of diet was mainly attributed to high-fat diets. To investigate the mechanism of high-fat diet-induced colorectal cancer, we systematically quantified the phosphoproteome in human HT-29 cells treated with sodium palmitate (PA). p-Annexin A2 (S26) was predicted to be specifically up-regulated by PA. We confirmed that PA-induced Annexin A2 phosphorylation at Ser26 in C57BL/6 J-ApcMin/J mice fed with high-fat diet. Phosphorylation of Annexin A2 at Ser26 promotes PA-induced proliferation of HT-29 cells. Moreover, PA suppressed SERCA activity and SERCA2 expression was compensatorily increased. Mechanistically, SERCA2 can partially reverse Annexin A2 phosphorylation at Ser26 caused by PA through intracellular calcium release. Finally, SERCA2 knockdown inhibited high-fat diet-induced tumor growth and Annexin A2 phosphorylation at Ser26 in SCID mice. In all, our studies demonstrate that high-fat diet promotes colorectal carcinogenesis through SERCA2 mediated serine phosphorylation of Annexin A2.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCMs) composites with thermally induced flexibility, lower interfacial thermal resistance, excellent stability, photo-absorption, higher thermal conductivity, good photo-thermal conversion and storage properties present better prospects in solar thermal application. This research prepared flexible PCMs composite by taking palmitic acid (PA) as PCMs, olefin block copolymers (OBC) as carriers and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) as additive by blending and hot-pressing method. The unique block structure of OBC, excellent performance of GNP and interaction between GNP and PA provide OBC/GNP/PA composites good flexibility, excellent stability and thermal reliability. GNP as effective solar trap and thermal conductive additive are attribute to the sunlight capture, high solar energy conversion and transportation. The photo-thermal conversion efficiency of OBC/GNP/PA PCMs composites with 4 wt % GNP reaches 86.21%. The thermal conductivity is 155% higher than PA/OBC. The phase change enthalpy is 145.52 J/g for adsorbing 77.6 wt% PAand 4 wt% GNP. PCMs composites show excellent energy storage properties. Practical and easy preparation method and excellent performances of OBC/GNP/PA composites provide a good idea and more possibility for flexible PCMs composites with enhanced thermal conductivity in low and medium temperature solar thermal application.

Abstract: Interfacial crosslinking is a useful and unique method for preparing films with desired structures. Here, a crosslinked structure film (Rc-mProdot) is obtained from the linear polymer (mProdot) with cross-linkable functional side-chains via the liquid/liquid interfacial crosslinking. Transmission phenomenon and Tyndall effect reflected the assembling progress of Rc-mProdot film. FT-IR and SEM data prove the formation of the desired cross-linked polymer film with loose structure precisely. Significantly, the desirable Rc-mProdot film not only retains the original color and similar electrochemical behaviors to these of the spin-coated mProdot polymer film, but also exhibits improved electrochromic and capacitance properties including a faster electrochromic discoloring time (0.26 s), larger capacitance (increasing by 60% than Rc-mProdot film) and a better charge-discharge stability (retaining 79.1% after 600 cycles). This work provides a simple and efficient approach to liquid/liquid interfacial Schiff-base reaction to construct conjugated polymer films with loose structure towards improving electrochromic and supercapacitor performance and applications.

Abstract: Direct absorption and conversion of sunlight by optical nanofluids into storable heat is an efficient and facile way to harness abundant clean solar energy, but achieving long-term stable dispersion of the nanofluids is challenging under elevated temperatures. Herein, we report the preparation of mesoporous crumpled graphene particles as self-dispersible solar absorbers that can achieve homogenous dispersion within medium-temperature silicone oil. The mesoporous crumpled graphene particles were synthesized by using an aerosol-assisted capillary compression process and a subsequent oxidative-etching reaction. By controlling the etching time, the introduced mesopores can tune the apparent density of the crumpled particles into a value comparable with the dispersing base fluid. The crumpled surface structure, small particle size and compatible density weaken the inter-particle van der Waals attraction and gravitational sedimentation tendency. The resultant silicone oil nanofluids have maintained their uniform dispersion under a heating temperature of 200 °C for 50 h. The stable uniform dispersion together with the high solar absorptance, the large specific heat capacity and the proper viscosity enabled the application of prepared nanofluids for consistent high-performance medium-temperature solar-thermal energy harvesting under concentrated solar irradiation.

Abstract: Multijunction solar cells must be electrically isolated from one to another at the end of the fabrication process; a step known as mesa isolation. In this study, three different techniques are assessed to perform this step: saw-dicing, wet etching and plasma etching. Triple junction solar cells were fabricated with each process and the open-circuit voltages were measured in order to compare the impact of each technique on the device performance. An optional wet treatment is also proposed to clean the sidewalls after the mesa isolation process. The mesa sidewalls were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to assess the profile length and roughness respectively. The cell performance was then correlated to the sidewall length and roughness for all three isolation techniques. This study indicates that a plasma etching process followed by a wet clean is the process that maximizes the solar cell performance, thanks to a short profile length and a low sidewall roughness.

Abstract: Wet chemically deposited NiOx is a promising hole-transport material in perovskite/Si tandem solar cells due to its high work function, chemical stability, and low cost. However, it requires subsequent annealing that may lead to the formation of SiOz at the Si interface to the bottom cell. These layers of nm thickness exhibit non-stoichiometric chemical composition and are detrimental for charge transport and passivation. In this contribution, we investigate the atomic and electronic structure as well as chemical properties of NiOx layers on Si after wet chemical deposition and annealing in air between 200 °C and 600 °C. For this purpose, photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and electron-energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope are applied. After deposition and annealing at 200 °C, a mixed bulk phase consisting of NiOxHy is found which transforms to pure NiOx above 300 °C. A parasitic SiOz layer is observed at the NiOx/Si interface after this process, with a thickness of 3–4 nm after annealing at 500 °C. The impact of this interfacial layer for electrical current transport will be discussed concerning optimized performance and integrability in perovskite/silicon tandems.

Abstract: Solar still is an economical device for purify brackish water, however its yield is low. Therefore, present work aims to increase the water output of tubular solar still (TSS) by introducing closed mild steel tubes filled with paraffin wax (as phase change material, PCM) and candle soot derived carbon nanoparticles (CSNP, 0.3 wt%) as dispersant for the first time. Experiments were conducted with three TSS – one with conventional TSS without any PCM, and the other two with only PCM and 0.3 wt % CSNP-PCM to augment the water production. There was an increase in thermal conductivity of 40.59% with 0.3 wt % CSNP over the base PCM. TGA analysis showed excellent thermal durability of 0.3 wt % CSNP-PCM and final degradation temperature was 314.26 °C. In addition, the dispersion of CSNP in PCM also altered the phase change temperatures with meager deviation from base case. The thermal performance analysis of TSS show that full day cumulative fresh water generation by conventional TSS was 3.04 kg/m2, whereas utilizing the PCM and 0.3% CSNP-PCM in tube inside TSS augmented the water generation by 42.4% and 87.82% respectively, than the baseline case. In addition, the modified TSS with PCM and 0.3 wt % CSNP-PCM exhibited higher energy efficiency of 59.26% and 109.94% respectively, than the base line case. The generated fresh water cost was only 0.014 $/kg for TSS with 0.3% CSNP-PCM. It is concluded that conductive CSNP doped PCM with excellent thermal performance significantly enhanced the water output of the SS and could be widely applied in other design of still for better thermal performance.

Abstract: A new two-component (composite) water sorbent MgSO4/Hydroxyapatite has been developed for sorption-based solar heat storage. The matrix of the composite is a hydroxyapatite (HAP) material with ordered structure, high surface area of 111.3 m2/g and mesopore dimensions centered at 45 nm. The composites, prepared by wet-impregnation of HAP with MgSO4, have lower specific surface area and similar mesopore dimensions as the matrix. The maximum water sorption capacity of HAP is 0.039 g/g, while the composite (20-MgSO4/HAP) possesses 3.7 times higher maximum water sorption capacity due to the presence of the salt in the matrix. The HAP composite containing 20% MgSO4 achieved the highest heat of hydration 464 J/g. A long-term cycling (dehydration at 150 and hydration at 30 °C at a relative humidity of 60%) confirms a comparatively good stability of the composite.

Abstract: Molten chloride mixtures are of great scientific and technical interest for sensible heat storage in solar power generation. In this work, the condensed phases in a LiCl–NaCl–KCl–ZnCl2 multicomponent system were critically evaluated and predicted via literature review and simulations of LiCl–KCl and KCl–ZnCl2 systems. Two innovative LiCl–NaCl–KCl–ZnCl2 quaternary chloride systems with low melting points were proposed and developed on the basis of a thermodynamic design. The thermal–physical properties of these two eutectic compositions, including melting point, mixing enthalpy, specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, and mass loss, were then experimentally determined. The experimental results were consistent with the theoretical predictions. The novel quaternary eutectic chlorides with excellent thermophysical properties developed herein are potential candidates for thermal energy storage and transfer materials in concentrating solar power plants.

Abstract: A novel reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOA)-MgCl2 composite sorbent is developed by impregnation for low-temperature thermochemical heat storage. Salt particles are dispersed on tunable rGOAs via pH values and hydrothermal temperatures. Parameters of salt particles including salt content, size, and crystallinity strongly depend on reduction degree of the rGOAs. High reduction degree of the rGOAs can improve salt content in composite sorbents and the highest salt content reaches up to 97.3 wt%. Moreover, lower reduction degree of the rGOAs is conducive to formation of salt particles with smaller size and lower crystallinity. Therefore, the composite sorbents with lower salt contents possess better sorption kinetics owing to weaker mass transfer barrier and the maximum water uptake is up to 1.16 g/g at 95% humidity under 25 °C. Dehydration temperature of the composite sorbents decreases to varying degrees compared with that of pure MgCl2⸱6H2O. Mass energy density (Qm) and volume energy density (Qv) of the composite sorbents increase with the rise of salt contents. The largest Qm of 2225.7 J/g is 216.5 J/g higher than that of MgCl2⸱6H2O and the largest Qv reaches up to 0.709 GJ/m3. Heat storage capacity of the composite sorbent after 5 dehydration-hydration cycles remains above 95% of the original. All the results indicate that the composite sorbent is a potential candidate for long-term heat storage.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop dual-colored electrochromic materials by combining two electrochromic active moieties (pyridinium quaternary salt and benzoate) in one molecule. Four star-shaped 4,4'-([4,4′-bipyridine]-2,6-diyl) dibenzoates with various alkyl, alkenyl, and aryl N-substituents were designed and their electrochemical/electrochromic performance studied. Electrochromic devices based on 4,4'-([4,4′-bipyridine]-2,6-diyl) dibenzoates exhibited dual-colored electrochromic behavior, good switching stability, and low power consumption. Compared to the compounds with alkenyl and aryl substituents, those with alkyl substituents showed longer lifetimes and better switching stabilities. Good electrochromic properties and low power consumption make this type of material a candidate for application in the fields of electronic paper, smart windows, and displays.

Abstract: To cope with the mismatch between solar energy generation and demand, developing thermal energy storage systems is necessary. Due to its low construction and operating costs and wide operating temperature range, the packed bed sensible heat storage system using air as the heat transfer fluid is becoming more and more popular. This paper proposes to use sintered ore particles as a sensible heat storage material. An experimental study is conducted to investigate the air resistance characteristics and thermal behavior of the sinter bed. Moreover, the effects of particle size, charging temperature, air flow and cycle times on storage performance of the bed are studied. The results show that the sinter bed has good thermal performance. The specific heat of the sinter is 0.86–0.98 J/g/°C in the range of 200–380 °C, which increases as the temperature rises. When the thermal storage system enters a stable operation state, the cycle efficiency of the sinter bed can reach 66.78%. In addition, due to the unique production process, sinter has the potential to improve its thermal properties by optimizing the ratio of raw materials and/or adding other auxiliary materials.

Abstract: We propose a simple and non-destructive method to access the properties of the defects within the subcells of multijunction solar cells (MJSC) based on the extension of two well-known techniques, namely Admittance Spectroscopy (AS) and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). Due to the electrical coupling between the subcells of an MJSC, the AS and DLTS signatures of the defects present in the subcells are difficult to identify and to properly analyse, and other independent phenomena could be misinterpreted as such. From numerical simulations and theoretical developments, it is shown how the use of dedicated experimental conditions, in particular specific light biases, on MJSCs can reveal the signatures of the defects present in each subcell and allow one to analyse them without misinterpretation.

Abstract: Growing evidence connects many of the Golgi known functions with cellular events related to cancer initiation and progression, including regulation of cell survival/death, proliferation, motility, metabolism and immune evasion. However, a broad and integrated understanding of the impact of the Golgi on cancer cell phenotype has not yet been achieved. Multiple cellular events involving the Golgi are associated with protein and lipid modification and trafficking. However, less explored aspects of this enigmatic organelle also contribute to cell fate decision-making by impacting signal transduction, redox and ion homeostasis. This article focuses on the molecular mechanisms and Golgi proteins underlying the impact of the Golgi on cancer cell phenotype. Special emphasis is given to emerging knowledge on redox and ion homeostasis. Current and potential cancer progression therapeutic strategies associated with this organelle will also be addressed.

Abstract: Heat-insulating semitransparent solar cells, with power-generating and energy-saving functions, have attracted wide attention due to their potential applications in building and automobile integrated photovoltaics. However, it is challenging to simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) in the wavelength of 400–800 nm for multifunctional semitransparent solar cells. Moreover, as an essential requirement for practical application, the thermal stability is still lacking. In this work, CsPbI2Br inorganic perovskite with high bandgap and superior thermal stability is selected as absorber, combined with ultrathin silver top electrodes for charge collection and infrared reflector, composing the heat-insulating and semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By virtue of dual-function ultrathin silver top electrodes, combined with high-index MoOx to further improve visible transmittance, the semitransparent PSCs exhibit PCE of >11% with high AVT of >21%, as well as an outstanding infrared ray energy rejection of >72%. Moreover, the semitransparent inorganic PSCs exhibit superior thermal stability than the organic-inorganic counterparts, remaining 75% and 65% of initial PCE after aging at 85 °C for 200 h in N2 and 105 h in air, respectively.

Abstract: While passive radiative cooling has shown great potential in temperate regions in lowering surface temperatures, its cooling performance under tropical climate that is characterised by high solar irradiance and humidity still lacks exploration. Herein, we adopt a highly reflective polymeric coating with BaSO4 particles dispersed in P(VdF-HFP) matrix for radiative cooling in the tropics. Through the strong Mie scattering of sunlight and intrinsic bond vibration, the substrate-independent average solar reflectance and infrared emittance within the 8–13 μm atmospheric window could reach 97% and 94.2%, respectively. For the first time, surfaces could maintain sub-ambient temperatures under direct exposure to the sky and surroundings even when the solar intensity was 1000 W/m2 and downwelling atmospheric radiation was 480 W/m2, while separately achieving 2 °C below ambient during night-time with an effective cooling power of 54.4 W/m2. With a scalable fabrication-process, our cost-effective single-layer coating can be easily applied to diverse substrates, which is suitable for real-world applications in the tropics.

Abstract: Objectives
With the growing incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the treatment-resistant invasive CSCC should be taken seriously. Retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) functions as a tumor suppressor gene and is associated with the proliferation inhibition to retinoic acid. Demethylase TET2 directed epigenetic landscape contributes to cell malignant transform and is involved in therapeutic resistance in tumors. Whether aberrant TET2 participated in the deficient RARβ remains largely unknown. Hereby, we identified the aberrant-TET2 directed epigenetic landscape contribute to the deficient RARβ in CSCC.
Methods
The immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of RARβ and TET2. The bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to detect the RARβ promoter methylation. Plasmid transfection was used to upregulate TET2 in CSCC cells. Stable overxpressed TET2 cells were used to detect the effect of TET2 on RARβ and drug sensitivity in the CCSC.
Results
We observed RARβ decreased with promoter hypermethylation in CSCC and aberrant TET2 associated with deficient RARβ. We upregulated TET2 could reverse promoter hypermethylation and showed a significantly increased expression of RARβ, which enhanced the sensitivity of tumor cells to retinoic acid treatment.
Conclusion
Aberrant TET2 leaded to the hypermethylation of RARβ promoter, which contributed to the deficient RARβ in CSCC. While reversing the hypermethylation of the RARβ promoter by recovering the TET2 could enhance tumor cells to be sensitive to retinoic acid.

Abstract: Effective contact formation during low-temperature firing with applied current was investigated in this study. The screen-printed electrode was fired using rapid thermal annealing and contacted by etching the passivation layer and forming Ag crystallites. In our previous study, we proposed a method for reducing this contact resistance from 5 to 1 mΩ cm2 by applying a current during the firing of a phosphorous-doped (P-doped) n+ emitter in a p-type Si wafer without a silicon nitride (SiNx) passivation layer. According to the results, current application during the firing of Si solar cells should reduce the required firing temperature. Herein, a current (3 A) was applied between the screen-printed electrode and P-doped n+ emitter in a p-type Si wafer with an SiNx passivation layer during low-temperature firing from 350 to 600 °C. The major effects of the proposed methods were a reduced contact resistance and enhanced of SiNx etching. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images at different firing temperatures demonstrated that current injection during firing promoted the etching of the SiNx layer. Additionally, the method of current injection with low-temperature firing proposed in this work resulted in a device with a solar cell efficiency of 19.0%, which is similar to the efficiency of a reference cell fired at a higher temperature.

Abstract: Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 salt is one of the candidates for 3rd generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, aiming to increase the operational temperature. This rise of temperature significantly increases the corrosion issue of molten salts. However, there is a lack of studies focused on the effect of salt flow on the corrosion kinetic for this ternary carbonate salt. In this work, corrosion experiments under static and dynamic conditions are compared for SS310 subjected to ternary carbonate salt at 600 °C. A complete characterization of the corrosion layer, surface and cross-section, was carried out by means of SEM-EDX and XRD, while the molten salts after the corrosion tests were analysed by ICP-OES and XPS. The dynamic experiment exhibited an enlarged spallation of the corrosion layer, leading to a thinner and less homogeneous scale. This feature exposed the chromium containing phase and considerably increased the extent of its dissolution into the salt. The obtained results remark that the detrimental effect of dynamic conditions on the corrosivity of molten carbonate salt cannot be neglected and must be taken into account in the design of 3rd generation CSP plants.

Abstract: Owing to its unique physical and chemical properties, graphene oxide (GO) has a wide range of applications in biomedical field. However, with the gradual improvement of biosafety investigations on nanomaterials, growing literatures have pointed out that GO could lead to oxidative stress, aggravation of inflammatory responses, and even irreversible lesions in human multi-tissues, while its damage to small intestinal remained unclear. In this study, we conducted an in-depth study on the toxicological effect of GO on intestinal tissues, and further clarified its toxic effect and molecular mechanism on inducing intestinal cell death. Firstly, we characterized the shape size, potential value, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) characterization and pro-oxidant properties of GO nanosheets. The cytotoxicity of different concentrations of GO to Caco-2 and IEC-6 cell lines was thereafter observed, which was specifically manifested as invoking NADPH Oxidase 1 (NOX1) proteins, accompanied generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since that, more p53 flowed into mitochondria to combine with cyclophilin D (CYPD), thus induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Through ROS-CyPD-mPTP signaling pathway, GO exerted imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis, while released cytochrome c (CytC) would ultimate caspase-dependent cell apoptosis. In vivo experiment also confirmed that the microstructure of small intestine was damaged, and the apoptosis rate and oxidative markers were significantly increased in GO-treated Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats (40 mg/kg once every other day from day 1 to day 9 by oral gavage). Based on these findings, we conclude that the adverse effects of oral exposure of GO on the biological system mainly concentrate in the digestive tract, and clarify the key role of ROS-mitochondrial homeostasis-apoptosis axis in GO-derived intestinal toxicity. Considering all these results and the fact that GO exhibited intestinal toxicity, we believe that this research providing a safety reference for its biomedical applications.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) is a key component for the practical application of concentrating solar thermal power. Recently, a push for higher temperatures has increased interest in molten salts with melting points above 550 °C as phase change thermal energy storage media. Corrosion of a nickel superalloy (C-276) with a eutectic salt mixture (59.5 %wt Na2CO3/40.5 %wt NaCl) at 650 °C was analysed under both isothermal conditions and with thermal cycle between 600 and 650 °C. Corrosion rates of 400–500 μm/year under isothermal conditions and 200–300 μm/year under thermal cycling were determined by measuring thickness loss, and oxide growth was primarily responsible for the metal loss. Thermal cycling reduced corrosion thickness, however it remained intact with no cracking or buckling. Post-test analysis of the salt found that molybdenum, manganese and tungsten were most likely to be removed from the alloy. Isothermal conditions did not cause chromium to be removed from the alloy by the salt. However, chromium was present in the salt after thermal cycling, due to its removal from the oxide layer. Whilst the corrosion was above the maximum acceptable corrosion rate for a TES system, this study shows that oxide layers formed on alloy C-276 have protective capabilities in this salt, gaining maximum thickness after about 400 h and preventing the salt from attacking the metal directly. Longer testing with more samples is require to determine if the corrosion of this alloy is halted due to the oxide layer growth on the metal surface.

Abstract: Solar steam generation technology is considered as a facile and effective way to produce clean water from undrinkable water resources. Herein, a composite material with a novel 3D structure has been proposed for steam generation. By developing porous NiAl, which exhibiting high strength and corrosion resistance, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fabricated via self-propagating reaction (SHS) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, respectively, the composite materials of NiAl/CNTs and 3D structures have been created. The results shows that the 3D composite materials of NiAl/CNTs possess high porosity (≥72.8%), open-pore structure can provide abundant passage for water transportation and steam escape. In particular, the combination of the extraordinary light absorption properties of CNTs and the multiple scattering of light in the 3D porous NiAl pores grants the materials with an excellent broad-band light absorption rate (94.4%) and high evaporation rate (2.41 kg m−2 h−1) under 1 sunlight irradiation. Furthermore, the NiAl/CNTs composite materials with 3D structure shows good purification effect on heavy metal ion, such as Cr3+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ and organic pollutants of RhB, as well as have excellent stability in simulated seawater and sewage. The findings provide guidance for the design of new high-performance materials that perfectly combine traditional 3D porous materials and CNTs for seawater desalination and sewage treatment.

Abstract: State-of-the-art solar cell technologies, such as hetero-junction cells or PERC cells, exhibit a time-dependent deformation of their current-voltage characteristics in fast solar simulator measurements. This hysteresis effect is due to an increased internal capacitance. It manifests itself as a pronounced difference between I–V-curves depending on the measurement direction, i.e. Isc→Voc or Voc→Isc. Thus, it leads to an imprecise determination of the cell performance parameters in particular at the maximum power point. In this study, an algorithm-based correction procedure for these capacitance-induced effects is presented. Using evolutionary optimization algorithms, our correction approach allows the determination of a steady-state curve together with the extraction of all cell parameters featured in a time-dependent equivalent circuit model. It can be implemented without any hardware upgrades and applied to measurement times as low as a few milliseconds. As our basic approach is entirely independent of the underlying model, it is applicable to any solar cell technology by adapting the model under consideration.

Abstract: We explored the use of inline plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to make P-doped poly-Si/SiOx-type contact for Si solar cells utilizing only industrially viable techniques, especially Ag metallization via screen-printing of a commercial fire-through paste. For this we used a thick (97 nm), non-blistering PECVD Si-rich SiCy layer, called SRC2.0, to minimize the damage due to the aggressive metallization process. The blistering suppression in SRC2.0 is achieved through the incorporation of carbon in the film but comes at the expense of its electrical conductivity. Despite this, ohmic contact between Si and SRC2.0/SiOx could be formed by annealing at 925 °C and higher. Moreover, we discovered that SRC2.0 has a detrimental effect on surface passivation with a thin (1.6 nm) SiOx layer that is typically used with poly-Si. This is due to reduction of the passivating SiOx layer during high-temperature annealing by the high amount (15%) of C in SRC2.0. Using a slightly thicker (1.9 nm) SiOx layer mitigated this effect, and J0 values of 10 fA/cm2 and lower (4 fA/cm2), and 40 fA/cm2 could be obtained in un-metallized and metallized regions, respectively. The best n-type Si solar cell with the SRC2.0/SiOx contact at the rear showed a very high short-circuit current density of 41.4 mA/cm2 and a good open-circuit voltage of 688.4 mV. Its efficiency was, however, limited to 20.7%. This was due to the high specific contact resistance ((10–40) mΩ·cm2) of the SRC2.0/SiOx contact, which in turn limited the fill-factor of the device to 72.6%. Nevertheless, the trends suggest that better device results can be obtained by using higher thermal budget.

Abstract: An ideal solar thermal absorber has a sharp transition between high and low absorptance at the wavelength where the blackbody emissive power begins to exceed the solar irradiance. However, most real selective absorbers have a fairly broad transition, leading to both solar absorption and thermal emission losses. Here, we model, fabricate, and characterize a highly selective semiconductor-dielectric-metal (Ga0.46In0.54As – MgF2 – Ag) solar absorber with an extremely sharp transition from high to low absorptance. The thin semiconductor serves as a selective filter, absorbing photons with wavelengths shorter than the bandgap and transmitting those with longer wavelengths. The highly reflective dielectric-metal rear mirror allows the structure to have very low emittance for longer wavelengths. These characteristics provide the absorber with a measured solar absorptance >91% below the bandgap wavelength and infrared emittance <5% at 100 °C above the bandgap wavelength. This transition wavelength can be tuned by modifying the semiconductor composition, and modeling indicates that the absorber's optical properties should be stable at high temperatures, making the structure a good candidate for unconcentrated to highly concentrated solar thermal energy conversion.

Abstract: In the construction industry, low-emissivity glass is used to improve both thermal efficiency and visual comfort by reflecting or transmitting thermal radiation. The solar optical performances of this type of glass are calculated using the ASTM G173 (AM 1.5) solar spectrum, the unique worldwide standard. However, the local atmospheric conditions of real sites around the world are different from those used to model the ASTM solar spectrum, originally created for PV deployment in North America in the 2000s. As the latter has an impact on the shape of the ground-based solar spectra, the real solar properties of the installed low-e glass can be different from those calculated in laboratory conditions and using the standard. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive, multi-years analysis of the solar performances of a complete set of low-e glass located on 12 sites around the world. Local solar spectra are modelled using local atmospheric data. This new study analyse the solar transmittance of low-e glass around the world. Our results show that the ASTM solar spectrum is appropriate for the majority of the selected locations. For some particular sites, such as buildings near the equator or located in cities with high atmospheric turbidity, the standard solar spectrum is not appropriate. For these sites, solar transmittance can vary up to 5% when compared to the ASTM standard. Consequently, this paper shows the necessity to include the impact of local atmospheric conditions on the performances of low-e glass.

Abstract: The compatibility between solar salt and structure materials is still a key issue in concentrated solar power (CSP) technology. The corrosivity of solar salt is significantly dependent on temperature. In this work, the temperature effect on the corrosion of 304 and 316L stainless steels (SS) in solar salt was studied at 500, 565, and 600 °C using electrochemical methods. Results indicate that higher values of icorr and corrosion rate (CR) are found for both 304 and 316L SS at higher temperatures. EIS results demonstrate that corrosion process of 304 SS in solar salt at 500 and 565 °C is controlled by ions transportation through the oxide layer. At 600 °C, however, the Warburg impedance is observed due to the porous and Cr2O3-free oxide layers formed on the surface of the sample exposed in molten solar salt for 138 h. Comparatively, the ions transportation through the oxide layer is always the rate-controlling process for 316L SS at each temperature. Protective oxide layer containing Cr2O3 is formed on 316L SS even at 600 °C. Moreover, the formation of Cr-rich nitride underneath the oxide/substrate interface depends on the temperature of melt and chemical composition of substrate.

Abstract: Concentrated solar plants are promising solutions for electricity production. In these plants, the heat transfer fluid plays an important role, and finding systems with good thermal properties is very important. In this regard, molten salts, and more particularly molten chlorides, are currently investigated. Experimental studies of these melts are difficult and expensive, so complementing them with simulations would allow to test a wider range of compositions. In this work, we show that classical molecular dynamics simulations are suitable for predicting the properties of a ternary salt composed of MgCl2, KCl and NaCl by extensive comparisons with experimental data (and previous simulations) on the density, heat capacity, viscosity and thermal conductivity. We then study the effect of adding fluoride ions in the melt on these properties in order to investigate the suitability of mixed chlorides-fluorides for future heat transfer fluids studies.

Abstract: Two design modifications to increase the evaporation/condensation and freshwater yield of conventional solar stills (CSS) are presented – absorber coating with black paint (BP) in which 10 wt % reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was dispersed, and use of a nano-silicon-coated glass cover alongside the rGO coated absorber. Water contact angle analysis revealed that the hydrophilic glass/condenser hindered water droplet movement, whereas the hydrophobic silicon-coated glass enabled significantly faster water droplet movement. The rGO-coated absorber SS, with 99.2% solar absorptivity, improved the average water temperature by 11% leading to an augmented full-day freshwater yield of 3031 mL (versus 2160 mL for the CSS). The synergistic effect of the nano-silicon-coated glass and rGO-coated absorber further enhanced the full-day freshwater yield to 3410 mL. Energy/exergy analysis demonstrated enhanced efficiencies of the combined condenser and absorber coated SS of 37% (energy) and 112% (exergy), compared to the CSS. Non-linear characteristic equations described the instantaneous gain in energy efficiency of the combined absorber and condenser coated SS. Absorber/basin exhibited the highest rate of irreversibility in all three SS. The cost of water was 0.01 $/L for the dual-modified still. Water physicochemical quality analysis before and after desalination revealed that the purified water was suitable for drinking.

Abstract: NFκB is a critical rapid-acting transcription factor that protects cancer cells from programmed cell death induced by stress or therapy. While NFκB works in nexus with non-classical oncoproteins such as STAT3 and AKT under a variety of conditions, it is a major antiapoptotic factor activated by TNF-α of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, it is surprising that PSMD10, an oncoprotein overexpressed in several cancers and a marker of poor prognosis, is reported to inhibit the NFκB pathway. In this study, we explore the role of PSMD10 in cancer cells exposed to TNF-α. We screen several breast and colon cancer cell lines and select SW480, a colon cancer cell line highly resistant to TNF-α, and demonstrate that PSMD10 knockdown sensitizes these cells to TNF-α induced cell death. One of the mechanisms involves transcriptional regulation of β-catenin and RB1, two key colon cancer cell specific anti-apoptotic factors. Surprisingly, we find that PSMD10 is required for optimal phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of NFκB (RELA). Thus, upon PSMD10 knockdown, there is significant downregulation of anti-apoptotic NFκB target genes TNFAIP3 (A20), BIRC2 (cIAP1), BIRC3 (cIAP2), and XIAP. Our study, for the first time, shows that PSMD10 is required for the activation of the pro-survival arm via NFκB transcriptional activation to prevent cancer cells from succumbing to TNF-induced cell death. In addition by transcriptional regulation of two major antiapoptotic players RB1 and β-catenin, PSMD10 proves to be a coveted oncoprotein with a key role in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Nowadays as the wafer sizes of the crystalline silicon solar cells get larger and larger, separating the cells becomes an essential step. However, in mass production, there is still lack of a low scribing loss and broad compatible cell separation method. In this work, a systematic investigation was conducted on the crystalline silicon solar cell separation processes, including the laser scribing and the cleaving process. Firstly, by combining a 1/4 beam splitter with the laser head, we developed a new laser scribing process, which can achieve a smaller groove width-to-depth ratio (24%) with narrower heat affected area (total width of 30 μm) compared to traditional laser optical systems. Then, we explored the minimum required scribing depths for separating four typical crystalline silicon cells by applying the thermal stress cleaving process. The Czochralski-grown substrates need only point scribing at the beginning and the end of the separating path, but if there is a metal electrode in the separation path, the scribing depth has to be about 20% of the cell thickness. At last, we analyzed the electrical and mechanical strength losses caused by different separation processes. The 20% scribing depth may cause about 30%rel mechanical strength loss. It is proved that combining this new scribing method with the thermal stress cleaving is an economical separation solution with less laser scribing loss and better compatibility for different cells. Our results would shed some light on future separating and module design efforts of solar cells.

Abstract: Integrated solar thermal conversion and latent heat storage based on phase change materials (PCMs) has emerged as a promising way for improving solar thermal utilization by avoiding redundant energy transport processes. However, the poor solar absorptance and low thermal conductivity of PCMs prohibit achieving high solar thermal energy storage efficiency. Here, bamboo-derived silicon carbide (BSiC) eco-ceramics based phase change composites are proposed to realize efficient, rapid, and compact solar thermal energy storage. BSiC/paraffin demonstrates a high thermal conductivity of 40 W m−1 K−1 at the porosity of 66%, where 96% pores are filled with paraffin and no prominent deterioration is observed after 2500 cycles. By further loading TiN nanoparticles on BSiC skeletons, an ultrahigh solar absorptance of 96.23% is obtained due to exciting broadband plasmonic resonances. Subsequently, the solar-thermal energy storage efficiency achieves as high as 91.1% at 1.62 W cm−2. The high-performance solar thermal energy storage benefits from continuous thermal conductive channels and excellent solar absorptance of BSiC/PCMs composites. For high temperature applications, BSiC/LiOH–LiF composites are developed and possess high thermal conductivity of 35.0 W m−1·K−1 and large latent heat of 309 kJ kg−1 simultaneously, but corrosion problems need to be tackled before long-time utilization. This work paves the way for applying BSiC eco-ceramics in high-performance solar thermal energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: Solid-state ionic conductors embodying either protons or lithium ions are very attractive for large-area electrochromic (EC) devices. In this work, aiming at the preparation of a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), two cheaper and non-toxic commercial resins are used: a urethane-based prepolymer (NOA65) and a vinyl acetate-based resin (MASTIFLEX). They are employed as host matrices to trap the liquid constituents, made of lithium perchlorate-propylene carbonate (LiClO4-PC). Thermogravimetric analyses indicate that both resins show excellent thermal performance. Several GPE formulations are investigated with respect to electrical and optical properties, varying the polymer-to-liquid ratio and LiClO4 concentration. The EC devices made with the two GPEs are also characterized in terms of optical contrast, switching kinetics and repetitive switching cycles. These activities made it possible to find the best formulations finally employed for the fabrication of 100 cm2 large area EC devices. The obtained results demonstrate that low-cost GPEs based on commercial polymers are electrochemically stable as ion-conducting media for EC devices.

Abstract: Solar steam generation is a promising method for clean water production. However, existing evaporation systems are limited by either expensive and complex equipment, or inadequate solar evaporation performance. In this paper, we prepared a biomass hybrid hydrogel (BHH) with hierarchical porous structure for efficient solar evaporation, in which starch and chitosan were used as hydrophilic substrates and PDA-Fe NPs was used as absorber. This specific microstructure plays an important role in improving light absorption, photothermal conversion and water transportation. The kerosene lamp structure evaporator endows centralized heat management and less heat loss. Therefore, our BHH evaporator performs high evaporation rate (3.9 kg m-2 h-1) and solar evaporation efficiency (103.2%). In addition, the evaporator shows favorable salt-resistant, durability and self-cleaning capacity, ensuring long-term and stable seawater evaporation. This study paves a new way for the development of low-cost, sustainable, efficient and salt-resistant evaporators for solar evaporation and desalination.

Abstract: Thermochromic rare-earth perovskite LaCoO3 is a promising functional material for the new generation of selective layers and for passive regulation in thermal solar collectors. Indeed, under stagnation conditions, the solar collector overheat and this inconvenience can be skirt using a selective layer with tunable emissivity. Materials capable of reversibly switching their infrared emissivity (ε) at a certain temperature efficiently avoid overheating in such systems. For LaCoO3, a distinguishable thermochromic effect is noticed starting at 77 °C. However, due to structural and chemical complexity, its design is challenging and requires a deep understanding of crystallization mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the influence of the co-deposition process of La and Co metallic targets on perovskite crystallization and optical properties of the material. All films were deposited on aluminum substrates by magnetron sputtering in the elemental or the compound mode (Ar or Ar/O2 atmosphere) using a semi-industrial reactor with back-and-forth scrolling of the substrate. The samples were post annealed in air for 2, 5, and 10 min at temperatures ranging between 500 and 600 °C and characterized using XRD, SIMS, TEM, and infrared camera. The measurements of infrared emissivity variation show an increase of the emissivity when the temperature raises confirming the great prospects of LaCoO3 usage for the considered application. A prototype of a solar collector equipped with LaCoO3 deposited in the elemental mode was built in order to demonstrate the potentiality of this perovskite as a thermoregulated selective layer.

Abstract: We demonstrate GaAs thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices with a patterned dielectric back contact (PDBC) architecture, featuring a dielectric spacer between the semiconductor and back metal contact over most of the back surface for high reflectance, and metal point contacts over a smaller area for electrical conduction. In the TPV application, high sub-bandgap reflectance is needed to reflect unused sub-bandgap photons to the thermal emitter to minimize energy losses in this portion of the thermal spectrum. We explore different PDBC fabrication processes with SU-8 and SiO2 dielectric spacer layers to maximize sub-bandgap reflectance while minimizing series resistance to increase TPV conversion efficiency. We successfully demonstrate GaAs SU-8 PDBC TPV devices with 2200 °C blackbody-weighted sub-bandgap reflectance of 94.9% and 96.5% with and without a front metal grid, respectively. This is 0.7% and 2.3% (absolute) higher than the mean sub-bandgap reflectance of 94.2% for GaAs baseline TPV devices with 100% Au back contact with front metal grid. Lower sub-bandgap reflectance in TPV devices with front grids indicates the front grid induces light scattering leading to additional parasitic absorption in the TPV device. We also show that for higher contact coverage fractions, the PDBC reflectance cannot in general be treated by a linear interpolation using simple 1D transfer matrix method modeling and should be treated instead as a diffraction grating by solving Maxwell's equations in 3D.

Abstract: Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are rarely used in the field of phase change heat storage, because their low thermal conductivity affects the practical application of composite phase change materials (PCMs). Three dimensional porous materials with good thermal conductivity and adsorption properties can be synthesized by cleverly combining high adsorption MOF with high thermal conductivity expanded graphite (EG). In this paper, ZIF-8 of zeolites with imidazole structure with high adsorption was prepared by method of co-precipitation. ZnO was prepared by carbonizing ZIF-8 in a vacuum tube furnace at 700°C. EG/CuS@ZnO was synthesized by compounding EG, the crosslinking agent polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and photothermal materials (CuS). Finally, OC/EG/CuS@ZnO was prepared by stirring impregnation process according to four different proportions of octadecanol (OC) and compounding with EG/CuS@ZnO. The microstructure and thermal properties of the samples were characterized. The result shows that the enthalpy of composite phase change materials OC/EG/CuS@ZnO reaches 202.97 J/g, which greatly improves the adsorption performance of OC and improves the heat storage performance. The thermal conductivity test results show that the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs with the ratio of ZnO to EG (1:8) is as high as about 11.77 W/(m·K). The results of photothermal experiments show that the composite PCM with CuS can improve its photothermal properties.

Abstract: Phase change composites with excellent light-to-thermal capacity can enhance the utilization efficiency of solar energy and reduce the energy crisis immensely. Current methods for constructing phase change composites include aerogel-based vacuum impregnation, melt blending, and other complex multi-steps methods, hindering their large-scale practical application in solar thermal storage. Here, we report an ingenious one-step strategy to construct sodium alginate (SA)/MXene-wrapped polyethylene glycol (PEG) crosslinked with calcium ions (Ca2+) to form a gel network, resulting in shape-stable biomass/MXene phase change composites (SMPCCs). The SMPCCs exhibit excellent solar thermal conversion capability and thermal reliability that the temperature will elevate significantly to 75.4 °C in 780 s and storage solar energy as latent heat during illumination. Furthermore, the neglectable decline of thermal energy storage property for the SMPCCs is less than 1% and 2.9% even after 100 cooling-heating and 20 light-thermal cycles, respectively. Thus, this work proposes a simple and effective approach for fabricating biomass-based phase change composites with good shape stability and excellent thermal energy storage performance, which have great potential for solar thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Herein we report application of a surface-coated [Fe(terpyridine)2]2+-containing metallo‐supramolecular polymer (MSP) in fabricating rechargeable bifunctional electrochromic energy-storage devices which were coupled with commercial silicon solar cell to demonstrate integrated solar energy harvesting, storage and utilization. The best MSP, {Fe1.5L1}n, chosen for the device-fabrication, evolved through a prior systematic structure-property investigation involving three similar but structurally fine-tuned polymers {Fe1.5L1}n, {Fe1.5L2}n, and {Fe1.5L3}n. The difference in the three-dimensional propagation and porosity of the {Fe1.5L1}n system from the other two polymers, resulted in its excellent spectroelectrochemical properties on indium-tin oxide (ITO) surface at an active-layer thickness of 345 nm. The fabricated five-layered solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) with this system, in the presence of solar energy, exhibited fast switching time (t = 1.2 s for coloration and 2.2 s for bleaching), high optical contrast (ΔT = 47%), high open-circuit charge-retention time (t50% = 193 min), and excellent cyclic stability (up to 10,000 cycles). The promising property of the device was attributed to the presence of a large excess of counter anions associated to the imidazolium moieties at the vicinity of the redox-active Fe sites of the polymer to stabilize the Fe(III) state efficiently by balancing the overall charge. Further, the device was used as a charge-storage material by connecting several devices in a series, and it was able to (i) power on a 3.5 V light-emitting diode (LED) bulb, (ii) run a 1.7 V digital thermo-hygrometer, and (iii) run a 3 V multimeter for 3 s, 40 s and 3 s respectively. Finally, switching of a 6 cm × 4 cm flexible ITO|PET-based EC device (PET = polyethylene terephthalate) was performed under bent condition using solar energy, and in the charged state, it was able to run a thermo-hygrometer for more than 2 min. This work unveils the hitherto unexplored opportunity to couple MSP-based ECD with solar-cell device (SCD) for solar energy storage and on-demand usage.

Abstract: Composite phase change materials (CPMCs) are of particular interest in high-temperature thermal energy storage and waste heat utilization applications. To further enhance their thermal conductivity, CPCMs are often doped with nanosized particles (NPs). However, NP's influence the PCM's viscosity and wettability, significantly contributing to the CPCM's microstructure. Their effects on the PCM's viscosity have been extensively documented, but little has been done on its effect on wettability. To this end, we investigated, using a custom maximum bubble pressure tensiometer, the surface tension of the solar salt, as well as its contact angle on an MgO {1 0 0} surface with various concentrations of α-SiO2 NPs. At 0.5 wt%, an increase of 2.45% on the surface tension is observed, scaling up to 11.8% at 2.5 wt%. Contrary to the pure salt, in the presence of SiO2 the surface tension increases up to 400 °C followed by rapid decay, which is found to be related to NP agglomeration and subsequent sedimentation. In terms of contact angle NP addition leads to an increase at the melting point, but fully wetting conditions are attained at 390 °C independent of α-SiO2 content. To capitalize on this effect, MgO-Solar salt CPCMs without and with 1.0 wt % SiO2 are kept at 390 °C for 5 h. Silica addition leads to smaller leakage (mass loss), improved density (by 8.9%), improved porosity (by 18.9%), mean pore size reduction (by 100%) and enhanced thermal diffusivity (by 6.5%). This is suggested to be indirectly related to the surface tension/wettability modification through doping with polar NPs.

Abstract: The modified acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate terpolymer (ASA) serving as thermal insulation material has been investigated, accompanied by the Y3Al5-xFexO12 (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0) inorganic powders as the functional modifiers. The formation of Fe-doped Y3Al5O12 has been ensured by analyzing XRD patterns and noticing the strong bands of M − O (M = Y, Al and Fe) vibrations in FTIR spectra. FE-SEM images revealed that the granular size of Fe-doped Y3Al5O12 powders is about 100–300 nm. The Fe-doped Y3Al5O12 assume dark yellow-brown color, stemming from the d-d electronic transition of Fe3+. Their NIR solar reflectance (86.47%–68.08%) presents a decreasing trend with the increasing Fe3+ doping concentration, which could be interpreted from the perspective of free carriers. The modified ASA with the Fe-doped Y3Al5O12 addition also has excellent NIR solar reflection performance. In addition, it is beneficial to increase the content of the as-synthesized pigments in ASA for NIR solar reflectivity. In simulated research, modified ASA is estimated to reduce the heat flux by up to 33.5% compared with unadded ASA. The high NIR solar reflection of the pigments and the inherent weather-fastness of ASA enabled the modified ASA to qualify for heat-insulation and energy-saving applications.

Abstract: Chloride molten salt is extremely corrosive at high temperature. Thus, it is significant to study molten salt purification schemes to prevent structural materials from high-temperature corrosion. This paper performed corrosion tests of a Ni–Fe-based materials (HT700 alloy) in ternary chloride molten salt at 800 °C to identify the inhibiting effects of Al powder by using electrochemical methods which included impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization, the morphologies and phase composition of HT700 alloy after corrosion tests were determined by scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Addition of Al powder could reduce the corrosion current density of HT700 alloy in chloride molten salt, the Al2O3 layer was formed from the reaction of Al and impurities on the surface of the alloy, and the beneficial effects of Al powder increased with increasing Al content added in the chloride molten salt. There was a diffusion layer beneath the oxide scale resulting from the outwards diffusion of Cr in the alloy, addition of Al could hinder the outwards diffusion of Cr, thus prolong the lifetime of HT700 alloy in the chloride molten salt. Otherwise, a protective Ni3Al layer formed by the inwards diffusion of Al when the content of addition Al reached up to 10 wt%. Therefore, addition of Al powder in ternary chloride molten salt as corrosion inhibitor was feasible, but the content of added Al should be optimized to balance the corrosive and the thermal-physics properties of the chloride molten salt.

Abstract: Trombe wall as effective passive design technology can achieve better building energy efficiency and thermal comfort. Considering the advantages of phase change materials in solar energy utilization, a new double layers PCM Trombe wall with multiple phase transition points was proposed in this study. A comparison study was conducted to investigate the thermal performance of the common wall without PCM (shorten as wall A), the common single layer PCM wall (shorten as wall B), and the common double layers PCM Trombe wall (shorten as wall C) along with the new double layers PCM Trombe wall using the validated Computational Fluid Dynamics models. The results showed that the average temperature in the new double layers PCM Trombe room can be reduced by 0.4–0.93C in summer and enhanced by 0.3–6.6 °C in winter. And the peak temperature occurrence time can be significantly delayed in summer. The heat flux can also be reduced by 9.1%–92% in summer and 1.8%–75.7% in winter. In summer/winter, the decrement factor of wall A, wall B, wall C and the new double layers PCM Trombe wall was 0.8003/0.8511, 0.7293/0.7347, 0.6252/0.4289 and 0.5381/0.4091; the aggregate discomfort degree was 19.2/197.59 °C•h, 12.6/152.18 °C•h, 8.5/50.21 °C•h, and 2.4/45.42 °C•h; and the relative fluctuation number was 0.6089/0.3943, 0.4368/0.02633, 0.5416/0.3943, 0.5007/0.02908. The conclusions confirm that the proposed double layers PCM Trombe wall performs excellently in controlling the indoor thermal environment.

Abstract: This work concerns the interpretation of capacitance spectroscopy results in perovskite-based solar cells. Based on the deep level transient spectroscopy and admittance spectroscopy results, we present arguments that the observable signals in perovskite-based solar cells come from anion migration rather than being a response from deep trap energy levels. The ion migration parameters, such as activation energy and ion concentration, are calculated and compared to theoretical values for different migration paths of ions in perovskites. Those parameters evolve with time, reflecting in the degradation of the cells, which we propose to link with a change in the anion migration path in perovskite.

Abstract: We show that the effect of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on carrier lifetime in GaInP grown by molecular beam epitaxy depends strongly on both doping type and density, and that these disparities must be accounted for to realize high-performance GaInP solar cells. Although the photoluminescence intensity and lifetime of lightly doped p- and n-GaInP improved greatly with RTA, heavily doped n+-GaInP showed sharp degradation upon RTA, preventing the realization of GaInP front-junction solar cells with low emitter sheet resistance. Since a low series resistance is important to achieve high fill factor (FF), we designed a front-junction cell utilizing a thin, lightly doped n-type emitter with delta doping to enhance conductivity, attaining an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.40 V and FF of 86%. We then designed rear-heterojunction solar cells to further leverage the relatively long lifetime of lightly n-doped GaInP (∼19 ns). With the help of delta doping in the n-AlInP window to improve surface passivation, we attained a VOC of 1.42 V, similar to cells grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of emitter formation with dopant diffusion from boron (B)-doped hydrogenated silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H) deposited on textured n-type monocrystalline silicon (n-c-Si) wafers using a 13.56 MHz plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. The B atoms in the a-SiOx:H are activated and diffused into the n-c-Si wafer during a high-temperature annealing to form a p/n junction for solar cell application. Afterward, the B-doped SiOx layer is removed by hydrofluoric acid selective etching to obtain a clean surface for the deposition of AlOx passivation and SiNx antireflection layers. With the optimization of the PECVD deposition and the following annealing/etching processes, the B diffused region with a sheet resistance of 60–100 Ω/sq and a junction depth of 1.2–1.5 μm is obtained. A champion implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 705 mV and a single-side saturated recombination current density (J0,s) of 17.6 fA/cm2 are obtained from a double-sided B diffused sample after the passivation with an atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) AlOx. In addition, the contact resistivity (ρc) at the metal/emitter interface is lower than 5 mΩcm2, where the metal contact is a Ti/Pd/Ag tri-layer structure. All of the material properties meet the requirements of high-efficiency solar cell. With the optimized emitter in the front, we made a SiOx and heavily phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon carbide (n-poly-SiCx) stack on the rear surface to form tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells. The results show that the iVoc of semi-finished TOPCon solar cell before metallization is more than 725 mV.

Abstract: The cooling effect of a super-amphiphobic self-cleaning radiative cooling coating (RC coating) on various substrates was systematically studied under real working conditions and compared with that of conventional cool white coatings. Under direct sunlight, the surface temperature of the RC coatings was always below the ambient air temperature, even up to 12.9 °C on concrete, whereas that of the conventional cool white coatings on concrete reached 4.1 °C above the ambient air temperature. When the RC coatings were applied to industrial facilities such as carbon-steel-based substation cabinets, the temperatures of the coated ceiling surface and interior remained below the ambient temperature, yielding an interior temperature reduction of 13.7 °C relative to the temperature of an unpainted substation cabinet. When applied to outdoor living facilities, including safety helmets, sunshades, and Roman tents with open and closed curtains, the RC coatings could greatly improve the thermal comfort either by reducing the air temperature beneath the open facilities or by significantly lowering the interior temperature of the closed space of the living supplies. Upon application to concrete buildings, the RC coatings reduced the temperatures of the concrete surface, roof surface, and room interior by 25.7, 12.9, and 11.5 °C below the ambient air temperature, respectively, the decrease in the latter two being 9.8 and 4.8 °C, respectively, relative to the buildings coated with 0.88-solar-reflectance conventional cool white coatings. The measured sub-ambient cooling effect agreed with the theoretical prediction. In summary, RC coatings have wide application prospects in cooling energy conservation and emission reduction.

Abstract: Hybrid perovskite solar cells have been under the radar of research efforts worldwide in the recent years. In particular, halide perovskite solar cells are of great interest for space applications due to their high efficiencies, low cost and extremely low weight. A few reports have shown good tolerance of the perovskite solar cells to high energy proton irradiation that adds interest for their space use. In this work, we explore the endurance of typical mesoscopic n-i-p MAPbI3 solar cells in LEO (low earth orbit) conditions. We observe no measurable damage to the J-V performance for 10 MeV protons by in-situ measurements for the cells containing Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transporting material (HTL). However, when P3HT is employed as the HTL, we observe a healing effect and the efficiency improves after irradiation. For the Spiro-OMeTAD case, we do observe degradation of the performance by lowering the proton energies to 5 and 1 MeV as expected due to the increased number of collisions. Numerical simulation by wxAMPS software allows to understand the origin of the damage for the studied architecture solar cells under 5 and 1 MeV.

Abstract: Nanoencapsulated phase change material (NanoEPCM) has the advantage of small size, large specific surface, good thermal reliability, and has broad application prospects in the field of thermal energy storage. However, most of the existing process conditions are relatively complicated, and it is difficult to prepare NanoEPCM with good microscopic morphology and excellent thermal properties. In this paper, a series of NanoEPCM with silicon dioxide (SiO2) as the shell material and disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD) as the core material are synthesized successfully by a facile sol-gel method. Firstly, the influence of the component ratio on the microscopic morphology of the NanoEPCM is predicted through a series of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) mesoscopic simulation methods, as a result, the experimental parameters are determined initially. Furthermore, NanoEPCM possessed excellent properties is synthesized and characterized completely. The results show that all the NanoEPCM synthesized have relatively obvious spherical shape, which verifies the accuracy of the simulation results. In addition, the melting enthalpy and the encapsulation ratio of the obtained NanoEPCM achieves as high as 165.6 J/g and 70.1%, respectively, the maximum charging-discharging efficiency is 90.3%, and the supercooling is suppressed to 1.0 °C. The excellent microscopic morphology and thermal properties of NanoEPCM benefit from the reasonable component ratio and appropriate reaction conditions. Therefore, the NanoEPCM with excellent thermal properties is of great importance in the prospective thermal energy storage application.
