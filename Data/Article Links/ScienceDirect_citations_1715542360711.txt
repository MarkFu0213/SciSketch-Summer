Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-17-producing γδ T (γδ17) cells play a central role in protective and pathogenic immune responses. However, the tissue-specific mechanisms that control the activation of these innate lymphocytes are not known. Here, we demonstrate that CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein highly expressed by keratinocytes, is an important regulator of skin homeostasis and γδ17 cell activation. Genetic deletion of CD109 results in spontaneous epidermal hyperplasia, aberrant accumulation of dermal-derived γδ17 cells, and enhanced susceptibility to psoriasiform inflammation. In this context, γδ17 activation requires interleukin (IL)-23 signals and is reversed by transient depletion of the skin microbiota. Mechanistically, CD109 restrains γδ17 cell activation in a cell-extrinsic manner by fortifying skin barrier integrity. Collectively, our data provide insight into the regulation of the skin IL-23/IL-17 immune axis and how homeostasis is maintained at this important barrier site.

Abstract: Summary
piRNAs play significant roles in suppressing transposons and nonself nucleic acids, maintaining genome integrity, and defending against viral infections. In C. elegans, piRNA precursors are transcribed in the nucleus and are subjected to a number of processing and maturation steps. The biogenesis of piRNAs is not fully understood. We use functional proteomics in C. elegans and identify a piRNA biogenesis and chromosome segregation (PICS) complex. The PICS complex contains TOFU-6, PID-1, PICS-1, TOST-1, and ERH-2, which exhibit dynamic localization among different subcellular compartments. In the germlines, the PICS complex contains TOFU-6/PICS-1/ERH-2/PID-1, is largely concentrated at the perinuclear granule zone, and engages in piRNA processing. During embryogenesis, the TOFU-6/PICS-1/ERH-2/TOST-1 complex accumulates in the nucleus and plays essential roles in chromosome segregation. The functions of these factors in mediating chromosome segregation are independent of piRNA production. We speculate that differential compositions of PICS factors may help cells coordinate distinct cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
An abnormal number of chromosomes, or aneuploidy, accounts for most spontaneous abortions, causes developmental defects, and is associated with aging and cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which aneuploidy disrupts cellular function remain largely unknown. Here, we show that aneuploidy disrupts the morphology of the nucleus. Mutations that increase the levels of long-chain bases suppress nuclear abnormalities of aneuploid yeast independent of karyotype identity. Quantitative lipidomics indicates that long-chain bases are integral components of the nuclear membrane in yeast. Cells isolated from patients with Down syndrome also show that abnormal nuclear morphologies and increases in long-chain bases not only suppress these abnormalities but also improve their fitness. We obtained similar results with cells isolated from patients with Patau or Edward syndrome, indicating that increases in long-chain bases improve the fitness of aneuploid cells in yeast and humans. Targeting lipid biosynthesis pathways represents an important strategy to suppress nuclear abnormalities in aneuploidy-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Neoantigen-specific T cells are increasingly viewed as important immunotherapy effectors, but physically isolating these rare cell populations is challenging. Here, we describe a sensitive method for the enumeration and isolation of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells from small samples of patient tumor or blood. The method relies on magnetic nanoparticles that present neoantigen-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers at high avidity by barcoded DNA linkers. The magnetic particles provide a convenient handle to isolate the desired cell populations, and the barcoded DNA enables multiplexed analysis. The method exhibits superior recovery of antigen-specific T cell populations relative to literature approaches. We applied the method to profile neoantigen-specific T cell populations in the tumor and blood of patients with metastatic melanoma over the course of anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We show that the method has value for monitoring clinical responses to cancer immunotherapy and might help guide the development of personalized mutational neoantigen-specific T cell therapies and cancer vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cell communication via ligand-receptor signaling is a fundamental feature of complex organs. Despite this, the global landscape of intercellular signaling in mammalian liver has not been elucidated. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on non-parenchymal cells isolated from healthy and NASH mouse livers. Secretome gene analysis revealed a highly connected network of intrahepatic signaling and disruption of vascular signaling in NASH. We uncovered the emergence of NASH-associated macrophages (NAMs), which are marked by high expression of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), as a feature of mouse and human NASH that is linked to disease severity and highly responsive to pharmacological and dietary interventions. Finally, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) serve as a hub of intrahepatic signaling via HSC-derived stellakines and their responsiveness to vasoactive hormones. These results provide unprecedented insights into the landscape of intercellular crosstalk and reprogramming of liver cells in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Endonuclease V (EndoV) cleaves the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to a deaminated adenosine (inosine). Although highly conserved, EndoV homologs change substrate preference from DNA in bacteria to RNA in eukaryotes. We have characterized EndoV from six different species and determined crystal structures of human EndoV and three EndoV homologs from bacteria to mouse in complex with inosine-containing DNA/RNA hybrid or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Inosine recognition is conserved, but changes in several connecting loops in eukaryotic EndoV confer recognition of 3 ribonucleotides upstream and 7 or 8 bp of dsRNA downstream of the cleavage site, and bacterial EndoV binds only 2 or 3 nt flanking the scissile phosphate. In addition to the two canonical metal ions in the active site, a third Mn2+ that coordinates the nucleophilic water appears necessary for product formation. Comparison of EndoV with its homologs RNase H1 and Argonaute reveals the principles by which these enzymes recognize RNA versus DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Deficiency in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms has been widely exploited for the treatment of different malignances, including homologous recombination (HR)-deficient breast and ovarian cancers. Here we demonstrate that diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) expressing LMO2 protein are functionally deficient in HR-mediated DSB repair. Mechanistically, LMO2 inhibits BRCA1 recruitment to DSBs by interacting with 53BP1 during repair. Similar to BRCA1-deficient cells, LMO2-positive DLBCLs and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells exhibit a high sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Furthermore, chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors synergize to inhibit the growth of LMO2-positive tumors. Together, our results reveal that LMO2 expression predicts HR deficiency and the potential therapeutic use of PARP inhibitors in DLBCL and T-ALL.

Abstract: Summary
Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to chromatin orchestrates gene expression programming and cell fate specification. However, the biophysical principles of TF cooperativity remain incompletely understood. Here we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the partnership between Sox2 and Oct4, two core members of the pluripotency gene regulatory network. We find that the ability of Sox2 to target DNA inside nucleosomes is strongly affected by the translational and rotational positioning of its binding motif. In contrast, Oct4 can access nucleosomal sites with equal capacities. Furthermore, the Sox2-Oct4 pair displays nonreciprocal cooperativity, with Oct4 modulating interaction of Sox2 with the nucleosome but not vice versa. Such cooperativity is conditional upon the composite motif’s residing at specific nucleosomal locations. These results reveal that pioneer factors possess distinct chromatin-binding properties and suggest that the same set of TFs can differentially regulate gene activities on the basis of their motif positions in the nucleosomal context.

Abstract: Summary
The translation machinery and the genes it decodes co-evolved to achieve production throughput and accuracy. Nonetheless, translation errors are frequent, and they affect physiology and protein evolution. Mapping translation errors in proteomes and understanding their causes is hindered by lack of a proteome-wide experimental methodology. We present the first methodology for systematic detection and quantification of errors in entire proteomes. Following proteome mass spectrometry, we identify, in E. coli and yeast, peptides whose mass indicates specific amino acid substitutions. Most substitutions result from codon-anticodon mispairing. Errors occur at sites that evolve rapidly and that minimally affect energetic stability, indicating selection for high translation fidelity. Ribosome density data show that errors occur at sites where ribosome velocity is higher, demonstrating a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Treating bacteria with an aminoglycoside antibiotic or deprivation of specific amino acids resulted in particular patterns of errors. These results reveal a mechanistic and evolutionary basis for translation fidelity.

Abstract: Summary
Spt5 is a conserved and essential transcription elongation factor that promotes promoter-proximal pausing, promoter escape, elongation, and mRNA processing. Spt5 plays specific roles in the transcription of inflammation and stress-induced genes and tri-nucleotide expanded-repeat genes involved in inherited neurological pathologies. Here, we report the identification of Spt5-Pol II small-molecule inhibitors (SPIs). SPIs faithfully reproduced Spt5 knockdown effects on promoter-proximal pausing, NF-κB activation, and expanded-repeat huntingtin gene transcription. Using SPIs, we identified Spt5 target genes that responded with profoundly diverse kinetics. SPIs uncovered the regulatory role of Spt5 in metabolism via GDF15, a food intake- and body weight-inhibitory hormone. SPIs further unveiled a role for Spt5 in promoting the 3′ end processing of histone genes. While several SPIs affect all Spt5 functions, a few inhibit a single one, implying uncoupling and selective targeting of Spt5 activities. SPIs expand the understanding of Spt5-Pol II functions and are potential drugs against metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Target RNA binding to crRNA-bound type III-A CRISPR-Cas multi-subunit Csm surveillance complexes activates cyclic-oligoadenylate (cAn) formation from ATP subunits positioned within the composite pair of Palm domain pockets of the Csm1 subunit. The generated cAn second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We have undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm effector ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1–Csm4 cassette, both bound to substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppAn), and products (cAn), to decipher mechanistic aspects of cAn formation and release. A network of intermolecular hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine specificity, with ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppAn intermediates and subsequent cAn formation by cyclization. We combine our structural results with published functional studies to highlight mechanistic insights into the role of the Csm effector complex in mediating the cAn signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Complement pathway overactivation can lead to neuronal damage in various neurological diseases. Although Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, previous work examining complement has largely focused on amyloidosis models. We find that glial cells show increased expression of classical complement components and the central component C3 in mouse models of amyloidosis (PS2APP) and more extensively tauopathy (TauP301S). Blocking complement function by deleting C3 rescues plaque-associated synapse loss in PS2APP mice and ameliorates neuron loss and brain atrophy in TauP301S mice, improving neurophysiological and behavioral measurements. In addition, C3 protein is elevated in AD patient brains, including at synapses, and levels and processing of C3 are increased in AD patient CSF and correlate with tau. These results demonstrate that complement activation contributes to neurodegeneration caused by tau pathology and suggest that blocking C3 function might be protective in AD and other tauopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are DNA elements that are bound by transcription factors (TFs), which recruit coactivators and the transcriptional machinery to genes. Phase-separated condensates of TFs and coactivators have been implicated in assembling the transcription machinery at particular enhancers, yet the role of DNA sequence in this process has not been explored. We show that DNA sequences encoding TF binding site number, density, and affinity above sharply defined thresholds drive condensation of TFs and coactivators. A combination of specific structured (TF-DNA) and weak multivalent (TF-coactivator) interactions allows for condensates to form at particular genomic loci determined by the DNA sequence and the complement of expressed TFs. DNA features found to drive condensation promote enhancer activity and transcription in cells. Our study provides a framework to understand how the genome can scaffold transcriptional condensates at specific loci and how the universal phenomenon of phase separation might regulate this process.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms coordinating pancreatic β cell metabolism with insulin secretion are essential for glucose homeostasis. One key mechanism of β cell nutrient sensing uses the mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP) cycle. In this cycle, mtGTP synthesized by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is hydrolyzed via mitochondrial PEPCK (PEPCK-M) to make phosphoenolpyruvate, a high-energy metabolite that integrates TCA cycling and anaplerosis with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Several strategies, including xenotopic overexpression of yeast mitochondrial GTP/GDP exchanger (GGC1) and human ATP and GTP-specific SCS isoforms, demonstrated the importance of the mtGTP cycle. These studies confirmed that mtGTP triggers and amplifies normal GSIS and rescues defects in GSIS both in vitro and in vivo. Increased mtGTP synthesis enhanced calcium oscillations during GSIS. mtGTP also augmented mitochondrial mass, increased insulin granule number, and membrane proximity without triggering de-differentiation or metabolic fragility. These data highlight the importance of the mtGTP signal in nutrient sensing, insulin secretion, mitochondrial maintenance, and β cell health.

Abstract: Summary
A key feature of immune functional impairment with age is the progressive involution of thymic tissue responsible for naive T cell production. In this study, we identify two major phases of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) loss during aging: a block in mature TEC differentiation from the pool of immature precursors, occurring at the onset of puberty, followed by impaired bipotent TEC progenitor differentiation and depletion of Sca-1lo cTEC and mTEC lineage-specific precursors. We reveal that an increase in follistatin production by aging TECs contributes to their own demise. TEC loss occurs primarily through the antagonism of activin A signaling, which we show is required for TEC maturation and acts in dissonance to BMP4, which promotes the maintenance of TEC progenitors. These results support a model in which an imbalance of activin A and BMP4 signaling underpins the degeneration of postnatal TEC maintenance during aging, and its reversal enables the transient replenishment of mature TECs.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is a crucial protein complex that plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR), including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Despite the significance of PP4, the mechanism by which PP4 is regulated remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified a novel PP4 inhibitor, protein phosphatase 4 inhibitory protein (PP4IP) and elucidated its cellular functions. PP4IP-knockout cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the phosphorylation status of PP4 substrates (H2AX, KAP1, and RPA2) was analyzed. Then we investigated that how PP4IP affects the cellular functions of PP4 by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair assays. PP4IP interacts with PP4 complex, which is affected by DNA damage and cell cycle progression and decreases the dephosphorylational activity of PP4. Both overexpression and depletion of PP4IP impairs DSB repairs and sensitizes cells to genotoxic stress, suggesting timely inhibition of PP4 to be indispensable for cells in responding to DNA damage. Our results identify a novel inhibitor of PP4 that inhibits PP4-mediated cellular functions and establish the physiological importance of this regulation. In addition, PP4IP might be developed as potential therapeutic reagents for targeting tumors particularly with high level of PP4C expression.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being fundamentally important and having direct therapeutic implications, the functional genomics of the clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is often impeded by the lack of genome-editing tools. Here, we report the establishment of a highly efficient, in situ genome-editing technique applicable in clinical and environmental isolates of the prototypic MDR pathogen P. aeruginosa by harnessing the endogenous type I-F CRISPR-Cas systems. Using this approach, we generate various reverse mutations in an epidemic MDR genotype, PA154197, and identify underlying resistance mechanisms that involve the extensive synergy among three different resistance determinants. Screening a series of “ancestor” mutant lines uncovers the remarkable sensitivity of the MDR line PA154197 to a class of small, cationic peptidomimetics, which sensitize PA154197 cells to antibiotics by perturbing outer-membrane permeability. These studies provide a framework for molecular genetics and anti-resistance drug discovery for clinically isolated MDR pathogens.

Abstract: βPix is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho family small GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42. It is known to regulate focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. However, the in vivo role of βPix is currently not well understood. Here, we report the production and characterization of βPix-KO mice. Loss of βPix results in embryonic lethality accompanied by abnormal developmental features, such as incomplete neural tube closure, impaired axial rotation, and failure of allantois-chorion fusion. We also generated βPix-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to examine βPix function in mouse fibroblasts. βPix-KO MEFs exhibit decreased Rac1 activity, and defects in cell spreading and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced ruffle formation and chemotaxis. The average size of focal adhesions is increased in βPix-KO MEFs. Interestingly, βPix-KO MEFs showed increased motility in random migration and rapid wound healing with elevated levels of MLC2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that βPix plays essential roles in early embryonic development, cell spreading, and cell migration in fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Complex ethological behaviors could be constructed from finite modules that are reproducible functional units of behavior. Here, we test this idea for foraging and develop methods to dissect rich behavior patterns in mice. We uncover discrete modules of foraging behavior reproducible across different strains and ages, as well as nonmodular behavioral sequences. Modules differ in terms of form, expression frequency, and expression timing and are expressed in a probabilistically determined order. Modules shape economic patterns of feeding, exposure, activity, and perseveration responses. The modular architecture of foraging changes developmentally, and different developmental, genetic, and parental effects are found to shape the expression of specific modules. Dissecting modules from complex patterns is powerful for phenotype analysis. We discover that both parental alleles of the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome gene Magel2 are functional in mice but regulate different modules. Our study found that complex economic patterns are built from finite, genetically controlled modules.

Abstract: Summary
GAPDH is emerging as a key player in T cell development and function. To investigate the role of GAPDH in T cells, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing GAPDH in the T cell lineage. Aged mice developed a peripheral Tfh-like lymphoma that recapitulated key molecular, pathological, and immunophenotypic features of human angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). GAPDH induced non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation in mouse T cells, which was strongly activated in human AITL. We developed a NIK inhibitor to reveal that targeting the NF-κB pathway prolonged AITL-bearing mouse survival alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting NF-κB signaling in AITL and provide a model for future AITL therapeutic investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Ras GTPases are mutated at codons 12, 13, and 61, with different frequencies in KRas, HRas, and NRas and in a cancer-specific manner. The G13D mutant appears in 25% of KRas-driven colorectal cancers, while observed only rarely in HRas or NRas. Structures of Ras G13D in the three isoforms show an open active site, with adjustments to the D13 backbone torsion angles and with disconnected switch regions. KRas G13D has unique features that destabilize the nucleotide-binding pocket. In KRas G13D bound to GDP, A59 is placed in the Mg2+ binding site, as in the HRas-SOS complex. Structure and biochemistry are consistent with an intermediate level of KRas G13D bound to GTP, relative to wild-type and KRas G12D, observed in genetically engineered mouse models. The results explain in part the elevated frequency of the G13D mutant in KRas over the other isoforms of Ras.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex is responsible for specific nuclear RNA degradation in mammalian cells. However, its function in development remains unknown. Here, we find that the depletion of a central factor of the NEXT complex, Zcchc8, in mouse results in developmental defects, a shortened lifespan, and infertility. We find that Zcchc8-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibit proliferation abnormalities and reduced developmental potencies. Importantly, the transcripts of retrotransposon element LINE1 are found to be targeted by Zcchc8 and degraded by a Zcchc8-mediated mechanism. We further find that sustained expression of higher levels of LINE1 RNA is detected in maternal Zcchc8-depleted oocytes and embryos. Zcchc8-depleted oocytes show higher chromatin accessibility and developmental defects in both meiotic maturation and embryogenesis after fertilization. Collectively, our study defines Zcchc8-mediated RNA degradation as an important post-transcription regulation of LINE1 transcripts in early embryos and ESCs, which play vital roles in the pluripotency and early development.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA catalytic core of spliceosomes as visualized by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) remains unchanged at different stages of splicing. However, we demonstrate that mutations within the core of yeast U6 snRNA modulate conformational changes between the two catalytic steps. We propose that the intramolecular stem-loop (ISL) of U6 exists in two competing states, changing between a default, non-catalytic conformation and a transient, catalytic conformation. Whereas stable interactions in the catalytic triplex promote catalysis and their disruptions favor exit from the catalytic conformation, destabilization of the lower ISL stem promotes catalysis and its stabilization supports exit from the catalytic conformation. Thus, in addition to the catalytic triplex, U6-ISL acts as an important dynamic component of the catalytic center. The relative flexibility of the lower U6-ISL stem is conserved across eukaryotes. Similar features are found in U6atac and domain V of group II introns, arguing for the generality of the proposed mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes store nutrients as lipid droplets (LDs), but how they organize their LD stores to balance lipid uptake, storage, and mobilization remains poorly understood. Here, using Drosophila fat body (FB) adipocytes, we characterize spatially distinct LD populations that are maintained by different lipid pools. We identify peripheral LDs (pLDs) that make close contact with the plasma membrane (PM) and are maintained by lipophorin-dependent lipid trafficking. pLDs are distinct from larger cytoplasmic medial LDs (mLDs), which are maintained by FASN1-dependent de novo lipogenesis. We find that sorting nexin CG1514 or Snazarus (Snz) associates with pLDs and regulates LD homeostasis at ER-PM contact sites. Loss of SNZ perturbs pLD organization, whereas Snz over-expression drives LD expansion, triacylglyceride production, starvation resistance, and lifespan extension through a DESAT1-dependent pathway. We propose that Drosophila adipocytes maintain spatially distinct LD populations and identify Snz as a regulator of LD organization and inter-organelle crosstalk.

Abstract: Summary
Previous genetic and biological evidence converge on the involvement of synaptic dysfunction in schizophrenia, and OPCML, encoding a synaptic membrane protein, is reported to be genetically associated with schizophrenia. However, its role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains largely unknown. Here, we found that Opcml is strongly expressed in the mouse hippocampus; ablation of Opcml leads to reduced phosphorylated cofilin and dysregulated F-actin dynamics, which disturbs the spine maturation. Furthermore, Opcml interacts with EphB2 to control the stability of spines by regulating the ephrin-EphB2-cofilin signaling pathway. Opcml-deficient mice display impaired cognitive behaviors and abnormal sensorimotor gating, which are similar to features in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Notably, the administration of aripiprazole partially restores the abnormal behaviors in Opcml−/− mice by increasing the phosphorylated cofilin level and facilitating spine maturation. We demonstrated a critical role of the schizophrenia-susceptible gene OPCML in spine maturation and cognitive behaviors via regulating the ephrin-EphB2-cofilin signaling pathway, providing further insights into the characteristics of schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational lipid modification that facilitates vesicular transport and subcellular localization of modified proteins. This process is catalyzed by ZDHHC enzymes that are implicated in several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss-of-function mutations in ZDHHC9 have been identified in patients with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and associated with increased epilepsy risk. Loss of Zdhhc9 function in hippocampal cultures leads to shorter dendritic arbors and fewer inhibitory synapses, altering the ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory inputs formed onto Zdhhc9-deficient cells. While Zdhhc9 promotes dendrite outgrowth through the palmitoylation of the GTPase Ras, it promotes inhibitory synapse formation through the palmitoylation of another GTPase, TC10. Zdhhc9 knockout mice exhibit seizure-like activity together with increased frequency and amplitude of both spontaneous and miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These findings present a plausible mechanism for how the loss of ZDHHC9 function may contribute to XLID and epilepsy.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which steatosis of the liver progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and end-stage liver disease remain elusive. Metabolic derangements in hepatocytes controlled by SIRT1 play a role in the development of fatty liver in inbred animals. The ability to perform similar studies using human tissue has been limited by the genetic variability in man. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with controllable expression of SIRT1. By differentiating edited iPSCs into hepatocytes and knocking down SIRT1, we found increased fatty acid biosynthesis that exacerbates fat accumulation. To model human fatty livers, we repopulated decellularized rat livers with human mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and human SIRT1 knockdown iPSC-derived hepatocytes and found that the human iPSC-derived liver tissue developed macrosteatosis, acquired proinflammatory phenotype, and shared a similar lipid and metabolic profiling to human fatty livers. Biofabrication of genetically edited human liver tissue may become an important tool for investigating human liver biology and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a key transcriptional regulator of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in response to carbohydrates and in hepatic steatosis. Mechanisms underlying nutrient modulation of ChREBP are under active investigation. Here we identify host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) as a previously unknown ChREBP-interacting protein that is enriched in liver biopsies of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Biochemical and genetic studies show that HCF-1 is O-GlcNAcylated in response to glucose as a prerequisite for its binding to ChREBP and subsequent recruitment of OGT, ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation, and activation. The HCF-1:ChREBP complex resides at lipogenic gene promoters, where HCF-1 regulates H3K4 trimethylation to prime recruitment of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylase PHF2 for epigenetic activation of these promoters. Overall, these findings define HCF-1’s interaction with ChREBP as a previously unappreciated mechanism whereby glucose signals are both relayed to ChREBP and transmitted for epigenetic regulation of lipogenic genes.

Abstract: Summary
Although double-strand break (DSB) repair is essential for a cell’s survival, little is known about how DSB repair mechanisms are affected by age. Here we characterize the impact of cellular aging on the efficiency of single-strand annealing (SSA), a DSB repair mechanism. We measure SSA repair efficiency in young and old yeast cells and report a 23.4% decline in repair efficiency. This decline is not due to increased use of non-homologous end joining. Instead, we identify increased G1 phase duration in old cells as a factor responsible for the decreased SSA repair efficiency. Expression of 3xCLN2 leads to higher SSA repair efficiency in old cells compared with expression of 1xCLN2, confirming the involvement of cell-cycle regulation in age-associated repair inefficiency. Examining how SSA repair efficiency is affected by sequence heterology, we find that heteroduplex rejection remains high in old cells. Our work provides insights into the links between single-cell aging and DSB repair efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in cancer immunotherapies make it critical to identify genes that modulate antigen presentation and tumor-immune interactions. We report that DUX4, an early embryonic transcription factor that is normally silenced in somatic tissues, is re-expressed in diverse solid cancers. Both cis-acting inherited genetic variation and somatically acquired mutations in trans-acting repressors contribute to DUX4 re-expression in cancer. Although many DUX4 target genes encode self-antigens, DUX4-expressing cancers were paradoxically characterized by reduced markers of anti-tumor cytolytic activity and lower major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression. We demonstrate that DUX4 expression blocks interferon-γ-mediated induction of MHC class I, implicating suppressed antigen presentation in DUX4-mediated immune evasion. Clinical data in metastatic melanoma confirmed that DUX4 expression was associated with significantly reduced progression-free and overall survival in response to anti-CTLA-4. Our results demonstrate that cancers can escape immune surveillance by reactivating a normal developmental pathway and identify a therapeutically relevant mechanism of cell-intrinsic immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Asymptomatic and symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects may present with equivalent neuropathological burdens but have significantly different antemortem cognitive decline rates. Using the transcriptome as a proxy for functional state, we selected 414 expression profiles of symptomatic AD subjects and age-matched non-demented controls from a community-based neuropathological study. By combining brain tissue-specific protein interactomes with gene networks, we identified functionally distinct composite clusters of genes that reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. Global expression for clusters broadly corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism, cell cycle, survival, and immune response were downregulated, while the upregulated cluster included largely uncharacterized processes. We propose that loss of EGR3 regulation mediates synaptic deficits by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Our results highlight the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations to generate a comprehensive framework for characterizing alterations in the molecular network as applied to AD.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid flow between cellular organelles occurs via membrane contact sites. Extended-synaptotagmins, known as tricalbins in yeast, mediate lipid transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM). How these proteins regulate membrane architecture to transport lipids across the aqueous space between bilayers remains unknown. Using correlative microscopy, electron cryo-tomography, and high-throughput genetics, we address the interplay of architecture and function in budding yeast. We find that ER-PM contacts differ in protein composition and membrane morphology, not in intermembrane distance. In situ electron cryo-tomography reveals the molecular organization of tricalbin-mediated contacts, suggesting a structural framework for putative lipid transfer. Genetic analysis uncovers functional overlap with cellular lipid routes, such as maintenance of PM asymmetry. Further redundancies are suggested for individual tricalbin protein domains. We propose a modularity of molecular and structural functions of tricalbins and of their roles within the cellular network of lipid distribution pathways.

Abstract: Testis development and ultrastructure of spermatogenic cells and spermatozoa of burbot Lota lota, a commercially important cold freshwater fish, were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. Spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa are distributed along the seminiferous tubules. Electron-dense bodies appear in germ cells from primary spermatogonia to secondary spermatocytes. We identified three distinct stages of spermatid cell differentiation based on chromatin condensation, development of the flagellum, formation of a nuclear fossa, and elimination of excess cytoplasm. Spermatozoa were anacrosomal and characterized by location of the centrioles outside the nuclear fossa and incomplete perpendicular arrangement of the centrioles. The sperm flagellum displayed an axoneme with nine doublets of peripheral microtubules and two central microtubules. These results provide valuable information for burbot taxonomy and may clarify the process of spermatogenesis for this species.

Abstract: Summary
Precisely controlled gene regulatory networks are required during embryonic development to give rise to various structures, including those of the cardiovascular system. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) loci are known to be important regulators of these genetic programs. We have identified a novel and essential lncRNA locus Handsdown (Hdn), active in early heart cells, and show by genetic inactivation that it is essential for murine development. Hdn displays haploinsufficiency for cardiac development as Hdn-heterozygous adult mice exhibit hyperplasia in the right ventricular wall. Transcriptional activity of the Hdn locus, independent of its RNA, suppresses its neighboring gene Hand2. We reveal a switch in a topologically associated domain in differentiation of the cardiac lineage, allowing the Hdn locus to directly interact with regulatory elements of the Hand2 locus.

C-di-GMP can exert its function as a second messenger via riboswitch binding, and a functional c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitch has been found upstream of cbpA in various B. cereus group strains. Protein signature recognition predicted CbpA to be a cell wall-anchored surface protein with a fibrinogen or collagen binding domain. The aim of this study was to identify the binding ligand of CbpA and the function of CbpA in cellular processes that are part of the B. cereus group c-di-GMP regulatory network. By global gene expression profiling cbpA was found to be down-regulated in a cdgF deletion mutant, and cbpA exhibited maximum expression in early exponential growth. Contrary to the wild type, a ΔcbpA deletion mutant showed no binding to collagen in a cell adhesion assay, while a CbpA overexpression strain exhibited slightly increased collagen binding compared to the control. For both fibrinogen and fibronectin there was however no change in binding activity compared to controls, and CbpA did not appear to contribute to binding to abiotic surfaces (polystyrene, glass, steel). Also, the CbpA overexpression strain appeared to be less motile and showed a decrease in biofilm formation compared to the control. This study provides the first experimental proof that the binding ligand of the c-di-GMP regulated adhesin CbpA is collagen.

Abstract: Summary
Every bacterial population harbors a small subpopulation of so-called persisters that are transiently antibiotic tolerant. These persisters are associated with the recalcitrance of chronic infections because they can recolonize the host after antibiotic removal. Although several effectors have been described to induce persistence, persister cell awakening is poorly understood. We previously reported that the toxin HokB induces persistence via pore formation, resulting in membrane depolarization and ATP leakage. We now delineate mechanisms responsible for the awakening of HokB-induced persisters. We show that HokB dimerization by the oxidoreductase DsbA is essential for pore formation and peptide stability. Pores are disassembled via DsbC-mediated monomerization, which targets HokB for DegQ-mediated degradation. Finally, pore disassembly allows membrane repolarization by the electron transport chain, supporting cells to resume growth. These results provide a detailed view of both the formation and awakening of HokB-induced persister cells.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by recognizing short and degenerate sequence motifs in their target transcripts, but precisely defining their binding specificity remains challenging. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) allows for mapping of the exact protein-RNA crosslink sites, which frequently reside at specific positions in RBP motifs at single-nucleotide resolution. Here, we have developed a computational method, named mCross, to jointly model RBP binding specificity while precisely registering the crosslinking position in motif sites. We applied mCross to 112 RBPs using ENCODE eCLIP data and validated the reliability of the discovered motifs by genome-wide analysis of allelic binding sites. Our analyses revealed that the prototypical SR protein SRSF1 recognizes clusters of GGA half-sites in addition to its canonical GGAGGA motif. Therefore, SRSF1 regulates splicing of a much larger repertoire of transcripts than previously appreciated, including HNRNPD and HNRNPDL, which are involved in multivalent protein assemblies and phase separation.

Abstract: Summary
Variable levels of DNA methylation have been reported at tissue-specific differential methylation regions (DMRs) overlapping enhancers, including super-enhancers (SEs) associated with key cell identity genes, but the mechanisms responsible for this intriguing behavior are not well understood. We used allele-specific reporters at the endogenous Sox2 and Mir290 SEs in embryonic stem cells and found that the allelic DNA methylation state is dynamically switching, resulting in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Dynamic DNA methylation is driven by the balance between DNA methyltransferases and transcription factor binding on one side and co-regulated with the Mediator complex recruitment and H3K27ac level changes at regulatory elements on the other side. DNA methylation at the Sox2 and the Mir290 SEs is independently regulated and has distinct consequences on the cellular differentiation state. Dynamic allele-specific DNA methylation at the two SEs was also seen at different stages in preimplantation embryos, revealing that methylation heterogeneity occurs in vivo.

Abstract: mRNA quality is controlled by multiple RNA surveillance machineries to reduce errors during gene expression processes in eukaryotic cells. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a well-characterized mechanism that degrades error-containing transcripts during translation. The ATP-dependent RNA helicase up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) is a key player in NMD that is mostly prevalent in the cytoplasm. However, recent studies on UPF1-RNA interaction suggest more comprehensive roles of UPF1 on diverse forms of target transcripts. Here we used subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence to understand such complex functions of UPF1. We demonstrated that UPF1 can be localized to the nucleus and predominantly associated with the chromatin. Moreover, we showed that UPF1 associates more strongly with the chromatin when the transcription elongation and translation inhibitors were used. These findings suggest a novel role of UPF1 in transcription elongation-coupled RNA machinery in the chromatin, as well as in translation-coupled NMD in the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose that cytoplasmic UPF1-centric RNA surveillance mechanism could be extended further up to the chromatin-associated UPF1 and co-transcriptional RNA surveillance. Our findings could provide the mechanistic insights on extensive regulatory roles of UPF1 for many cellular RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian organs continually exchange metabolites via circulation, but systems-level analysis of this shuttling process is lacking. Here, we compared, in fasted pigs, metabolite concentrations in arterial blood versus draining venous blood from 11 organs. Greater than 90% of metabolites showed arterial-venous differences across at least one organ. Surprisingly, the liver and kidneys released not only glucose but also amino acids, both of which were consumed primarily by the intestine and pancreas. The liver and kidneys exhibited additional unexpected activities: liver preferentially burned unsaturated over more atherogenic saturated fatty acids, whereas the kidneys were unique in burning circulating citrate and net oxidizing lactate to pyruvate, thereby contributing to circulating redox homeostasis. Furthermore, we observed more than 700 other cases of tissue-specific metabolite production or consumption, such as release of nucleotides by the spleen and TCA intermediates by pancreas. These data constitute a high-value resource, providing a quantitative atlas of inter-organ metabolite exchange.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells balance cellular fates through asymmetric and symmetric divisions in order to self-renew or to generate downstream progenitors. Symmetric commitment divisions in stem cells are required for rapid regeneration during tissue damage and stress. The control of symmetric commitment remains poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in combination with transcriptomic profiling of HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) from control and m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 conditional knockout mice, we found that m6A-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) fail to symmetrically differentiate. Dividing HSCs are expanded and are blocked in an intermediate state that molecularly and functionally resembles multipotent progenitors. Mechanistically, RNA methylation controls Myc mRNA abundance in differentiating HSCs. We identified MYC as a marker for HSC asymmetric and symmetric commitment. Overall, our results indicate that RNA methylation controls symmetric commitment and cell identity of HSCs and may provide a general mechanism for how stem cells regulate differentiation fate choice.

Abstract: The etiology and molecular characteristics of Leydig cell tumor (LCT) are scarcely known. From the research data stems that estrogen can be implicated in LCT induction and development, however it is not investigated in detail. Considering the above, herein we analyzed the relation between G-protein coupled membrane estrogen receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and insulin-like family peptides (insulin-like 3 peptide; INSL3 and relaxin; RLN) expressions as well as estrogen level with impact of xenoestrogen (bisphenol A; BPA, tetrabromobisphenol A; TBBPA, and tetrachlorobisphenol A; TCBPA). While in our previous studies altered GPER-PPAR partnership was found in human LCT being a possible cause and/or additionally effecting on LCT development, here mouse testes with experimentally induced LCT and mouse tumor Leydig cell (MA-10) treated with BPA chemicals were examined. We revealed either diverse changes in expression or co-expression of GPER and PPAR in mouse LCT as well as in MA-10 cells after BPA analogues when compared to human LCT. Relationships between expression of INSL3, RLN, including co-expression, and estrogen level in human LCT, mouse LCT and MA-10 cells xenoestrogen-treated were found. Moreover, involvement of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway or only mTOR in the interactions of examined receptors and hormones was showed. Taken together, species, cell of origin, experimental system used and type of used chemical differences may result in diverse molecular characteristics of LCT. Estrogen/xenoestrogen may play a role in tumor Leydig cell proliferation and biochemical nature but this issue requires further studies. Experimentally-induced LCT in mouse testis and MA-10 cells after BPA exposure seem to be additional models for understanding some aspects of human LCT biology.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal control over protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation and for completion of the cell division cycle during exit from mitosis. In budding yeast, the Cdc14 phosphatase is thought to be a major regulator at this time, while in higher eukaryotes PP2A phosphatases take a dominant role. Here, we use time-resolved phosphoproteome analysis in budding yeast to evaluate the respective contributions of Cdc14, PP2ACdc55, and PP2ARts1. This reveals an overlapping requirement for all three phosphatases during mitotic progression. Our time-resolved phosphoproteome resource reveals how Cdc14 instructs the sequential pattern of phosphorylation changes, in part through preferential recognition of serine-based cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrates. PP2ACdc55 and PP2ARts1 in turn exhibit a broad substrate spectrum with some selectivity for phosphothreonines and a role for PP2ARts1 in sustaining Aurora kinase activity. These results illustrate synergy and coordination between phosphatases as they orchestrate phosphoproteome dynamics during mitotic progression.

Abstract: Summary
In the ovary, follicular growth and maturation are complicated processes that involve a series of morphological and physiological changes in oocytes and somatic cells leading to ovulation and luteinization, essential processes for fertility. Given the complexity of ovulation, characterization of genome-wide regulatory elements is essential to understand the mechanisms governing the expression of specific genes in the rapidly differentiating follicle. We therefore employed a systems biology approach to determine global transcriptional mechanisms during the early stages of the ovulatory process. We demonstrate that, following the hormonal signal that initiates ovulation, granulosa cells undergo major modification of distal regulatory elements, which coincides with cistrome reprogramming of the indispensable orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). This cistromic reorganization correlates with the extensive changes in gene expression in granulosa cells leading to ovulation. Together, our study yields a highly detailed transcriptional map delineating ovarian cell differentiation during the initiation of ovulation.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA hypomethylation that occurs when embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are directed to the ground state of naive pluripotency by culturing in two small molecule inhibitors (2i) results in redistribution of polycomb (H3K27me3) away from its target loci. Here, we demonstrate that 3D genome organization is also altered in 2i, with chromatin decompaction at polycomb target loci and a loss of long-range polycomb interactions. By preventing DNA hypomethylation during the transition to the ground state, we are able to restore to ESC in 2i the H3K27me3 distribution, as well as polycomb-mediated 3D genome organization that is characteristic of primed ESCs grown in serum. However, these cells retain the functional characteristics of 2i ground-state ESCs. Our findings demonstrate the central role of DNA methylation in shaping major aspects of 3D genome organization but caution against assuming causal roles for the epigenome and 3D genome in gene regulation and function in ESCs.

Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone essential for seed development and seedling growth under unfavorable environmental conditions. The signaling pathway leading to ABA response has been established, but relatively little is known about the functional regulation of the constituent signaling components. Here, we present several lines of evidence that Arabidopsis Raf-like kinase Raf10 modulates the core ABA signaling downstream of signal perception step. In particular, Raf10 phosphorylates subclass III SnRK2s (SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3, and SnRK2.6), which are key positive regulators, and our study focused on SnRK2.3 indicates that Raf10 enhances its kinase activity and may facilitate its release from negative regulators. Raf10 also phosphorylates transcription factors (ABI5, ABF2, and ABI3) critical for ABA-regulted gene expression. Furthermore, Raf10 was found to be essential for the in vivo functions of SnRK2s and ABI5. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Raf10 is a novel regulatory component of core ABA signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by considering their unique gene expression. DoubletDecon has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with a single functional copy of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor have elevated risks for breast, ovarian, and other solid tumor malignancies. The exact mechanisms of carcinogenesis due to BRCA2 haploinsufficiency remain unclear, but one possibility is that at-risk cells are subject to acute periods of decreased BRCA2 availability and function (“BRCA2-crisis”), which may contribute to disease. Here, we establish an in vitro model for BRCA2-crisis that demonstrates chromatin remodeling and activation of an NF-κB survival pathway in response to transient BRCA2 depletion. Mechanistically, we identify BRCA2 chromatin binding, histone acetylation, and associated transcriptional activity as critical determinants of the epigenetic response to BRCA2-crisis. These chromatin alterations are reflected in transcriptional profiles of pre-malignant tissues from BRCA2 carriers and, therefore, may reflect natural steps in human disease. By modeling BRCA2-crisis in vitro, we have derived insights into pre-neoplastic molecular alterations that may enhance the development of preventative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The chimeric transcription factor TCF3-HLF defines an incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype. Here we decipher the regulome of endogenous TCF3-HLF and dissect its essential transcriptional components and targets by functional genomics. We demonstrate that TCF3-HLF recruits HLF binding sites at hematopoietic stem cell/myeloid lineage associated (super-) enhancers to drive lineage identity and self-renewal. Among direct targets, hijacking an HLF binding site in a MYC enhancer cluster by TCF3-HLF activates a conserved MYC-driven transformation program crucial for leukemia propagation in vivo. TCF3-HLF pioneers the cooperation with ERG and recruits histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300), conferring susceptibility to EP300 inhibition. Our study provides a framework for targeting driving transcriptional dependencies in this fatal leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
The X-linked DDX3X gene encodes an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase frequently altered in various human cancers, including melanomas. Despite its important roles in translation and splicing, how DDX3X dysfunction specifically rewires gene expression in melanoma remains completely unknown. Here, we uncover a DDX3X-driven post-transcriptional program that dictates melanoma phenotype and poor disease prognosis. Through an unbiased analysis of translating ribosomes, we identified the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, MITF, as a key DDX3X translational target that directs a proliferative-to-metastatic phenotypic switch in melanoma cells. Mechanistically, DDX3X controls MITF mRNA translation via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) embedded within the 5′ UTR. Through this exquisite translation-based regulatory mechanism, DDX3X steers MITF protein levels dictating melanoma metastatic potential in vivo and response to targeted therapy. Together, these findings unravel a post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation that may provide a unique therapeutic vulnerability in aggressive male melanomas.

Abstract: Summary
cADPR is a well-recognized signaling molecule by modulating the RyRs, but considerable debate exists regarding whether cADPR can bind to and gate the TRPM2 channel, which mediates oxidative stress signaling in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Here, we show that purified cADPR evoked TRPM2 channel currents in both whole-cell and cell-free single-channel recordings and specific binding of cADPR to the purified NUDT9-H domain of TRPM2 by surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, by combining computational modeling with electrophysiological recordings, we show that the TRPM2 channels carrying point mutations at H1346, T1347, L1379, S1391, E1409, and L1484 possess distinct sensitivity profiles for ADPR and cADPR. These results clearly indicate cADPR is a bona fide activator at the TRPM2 channel and clearly delineate the structural basis for cADPR binding, which not only lead to a better understanding in the gating mechanism of TRPM2 channel but also shed light on a cADPR-induced RyRs-independent Ca2+ signaling mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The success of immunotherapy has led to a myriad of clinical trials accompanied by efforts to gain mechanistic insight and identify predictive signatures for personalization. However, many immune monitoring technologies face investigator bias, missing unanticipated cellular responses in limited clinical material. We present here a mass cytometry (CyTOF) workflow for standardized, systems-level biomarker discovery in immunotherapy trials. To broadly enumerate immune cell identity and activity, we established and extensively assessed a reference panel of 33 antibodies to cover major cell subsets, simultaneously quantifying activation and immune checkpoint molecules in a single assay. This assay enumerates ≥98% of peripheral immune cells with ≥4 positively identifying antigens. Robustness and reproducibility are demonstrated on multiple samples types, across two research centers and by orthogonal measurements. Using automated analysis, we identify stratifying immune signatures in bone marrow transplantation-associated graft-versus-host disease. Together, this validated workflow ensures comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis and data comparability and will accelerate biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct oxygenases and their oxylipin products have been shown to participate in thermogenesis by mediating physiological adaptations required to sustain body temperature. Since the role of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family in cold adaptation remains elusive, we aimed to investigate whether, and how, LOX activity is required for cold adaptation and to identify LOX-derived lipid mediators that could serve as putative cold mimetics with therapeutic potential to combat diabetes. By utilizing mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics in mice and humans, we demonstrated that cold and β3-adrenergic stimulation could promote the biosynthesis and release of 12-LOX metabolites from brown adipose tissue (BAT). Moreover, 12-LOX ablation in mouse brown adipocytes impaired glucose uptake and metabolism, resulting in blunted adaptation to the cold in vivo. The cold-induced 12-LOX product 12-HEPE was found to be a batokine that improves glucose metabolism by promoting glucose uptake into adipocytes and skeletal muscle through activation of an insulin-like intracellular signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) threaten genome stability throughout life and are linked to tumorigenesis in humans. To initiate DSB repair by end joining or homologous recombination, the Mre11-nuclease Rad50-ATPase complex detects and processes diverse and obstructed DNA ends, but a structural mechanism is still lacking. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the E. coli Mre11-Rad50 homolog SbcCD in resting and DNA-bound cutting states. In the resting state, Mre11’s nuclease is blocked by ATP-Rad50, and the Rad50 coiled coils appear flexible. Upon DNA binding, the two coiled coils zip up into a rod and, together with the Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains, form a clamp around dsDNA. Mre11 moves to the side of Rad50, binds the DNA end, and assembles a DNA cutting channel for the nuclease reactions. The structures reveal how Mre11-Rad50 can detect and process diverse DNA ends and uncover a clamping and gating function for the coiled coils.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria undergo fission and fusion to maintain homeostasis, and tumors exhibit the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics. We recently demonstrated that ectopic HRasG12V promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and tumor growth through Erk phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). However, the role of Drp1 in the setting of endogenous oncogenic KRas remains unknown. Here, we show that Drp1 is required for KRas-driven anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts and patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines, and it promotes glycolytic flux, in part through the regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2). Furthermore, Drp1 deletion imparts a significant survival advantage in a model of KRas-driven pancreatic cancer, and tumors exhibit a strong selective pressure against complete Drp1 deletion. Rare tumors that arise in the absence of Drp1 have restored glycolysis but exhibit defective mitochondrial metabolism. This work demonstrates that Drp1 plays dual roles in KRas-driven tumor growth: supporting both glycolysis and mitochondrial function through independent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Although the in vitro structural and in vivo spatial characteristics of transcription factor (TF) binding are well defined, TF interactions with chromatin and other companion TFs during development are poorly understood. To analyze such interactions in vivo, we profiled several TFs across a time course of human embryonic stem cell differentiation and studied their interactions with nucleosomes and co-occurring TFs by enhanced chromatin occupancy (EChO), a computational strategy for classifying TF interactions with chromatin. EChO shows that multiple individual TFs can employ either direct DNA binding or “pioneer” nucleosome binding at different enhancer targets. Nucleosome binding is not exclusively confined to inaccessible chromatin but rather correlated with local binding of other TFs and degeneracy at key bases in the pioneer factor target motif responsible for direct DNA binding. Our strategy reveals a dynamic exchange of TFs at enhancers across developmental time that is aided by pioneer nucleosome binding.

Abstract: Microbes can modify their surface structure as an adaptive mechanism for survival and dissemination in the environment or inside the host. Altering their ability to respond to mechanical stimuli is part of this adaptive process. Since the 1990s, powerful micromanipulation tools have been developed that allow mechanical studies of microbial cell surfaces, exploring little known aspects of their dynamic behavior. This review concentrates on the study of mechanical and rheological properties of bacteria and fungi, focusing on their cell surface dynamics and biofilm formation.

Abstract: Summary
Microrchidia (MORC) ATPases are critical for gene silencing and chromatin compaction in multiple eukaryotic systems, but the mechanisms by which MORC proteins act are poorly understood. Here, we apply a series of biochemical, single-molecule, and cell-based imaging approaches to better understand the function of the Caenorhabditis elegans MORC-1 protein. We find that MORC-1 binds to DNA in a length-dependent but sequence non-specific manner and compacts DNA by forming DNA loops. MORC-1 molecules diffuse along DNA but become static as they grow into foci that are topologically entrapped on DNA. Consistent with the observed MORC-1 multimeric assemblies, MORC-1 forms nuclear puncta in cells and can also form phase-separated droplets in vitro. We also demonstrate that MORC-1 compacts nucleosome templates. These results suggest that MORCs affect genome structure and gene silencing by forming multimeric assemblages to topologically entrap and progressively loop and compact chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
American tegumentary leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by Leishmania protozoans. Innate immune cells undergo long-term functional reprogramming in response to infection or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination via a process called trained immunity, conferring non-specific protection from secondary infections. Here, we demonstrate that monocytes trained with the fungal cell wall component β-glucan confer enhanced protection against infections caused by Leishmania braziliensis through the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, this augmented immunological response is dependent on increased expression of interleukin 32 (IL-32). Studies performed using a humanized IL-32 transgenic mouse highlight the clinical implications of these findings in vivo. This study represents a definitive characterization of the role of IL-32γ in the trained phenotype induced by β-glucan or BCG, the results of which improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing trained immunity and Leishmania infection control.

Abstract: Summary
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged into the human population in 2012 and has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein have been characterized, but much less is known about antibodies targeting non-RBD epitopes. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting the MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD define a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contain a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrate that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation. These results advance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of coronaviruses and should facilitate the development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV.

Abstract: Summary
The fidelity of inhibitory neurotransmission is dependent on the accumulation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) at the appropriate synaptic sites. Synaptic GABAARs are constructed from α(1-3), β(1-3), and γ2 subunits, and neurons can target these subtypes to specific synapses. Here, we identify a 15-amino acid inhibitory synapse targeting motif (ISTM) within the α2 subunit that promotes the association between GABAARs and the inhibitory scaffold proteins collybistin and gephyrin. Using mice in which the ISTM has been introduced into the α1 subunit (Gabra1-2 mice), we show that the ISTM is critical for axo-axonic synapse formation, the efficacy of GABAergic neurotransmission, and seizure sensitivity. The Gabra1-2 mutation rescues seizure-induced lethality in Gabra2-1 mice, which lack axo-axonic synapses due to the deletion of the ISTM from the α2 subunit. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the ISTM plays a critical role in promoting inhibitory synapse formation, both in the axonic and somatodendritic compartments.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA modifications play important roles in regulating gene expression. One of the most abundant mRNA modifications is N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Here, we demonstrate that m6Am is an evolutionarily conserved mRNA modification mediated by the Phosphorylated CTD Interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1), which catalyzes m6A methylation on 2-O-methylated adenine located at the 5′ ends of mRNAs. Furthermore, PCIF1 catalyzes only 5′ m6Am methylation of capped mRNAs but not internal m6A methylation in vitro and in vivo. To study the biological role of m6Am, we developed a robust methodology (m6Am-Exo-Seq) to map its transcriptome-wide distribution, which revealed no global crosstalk between m6Am and m6A under assayed conditions, suggesting that m6Am is functionally distinct from m6A. Importantly, we find that m6Am does not alter mRNA transcription or stability but negatively impacts cap-dependent translation of methylated mRNAs. Together, we identify the only human mRNA m6Am methyltransferase and demonstrate a mechanism of gene expression regulation through PCIF1-mediated m6Am mRNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying mechanisms of how positive emotional valence (e.g., pleasure) causes preference of an associated context is poorly understood. Here, we show that activation of astrocytic μ-opioid receptor (MOR) drives conditioned place preference (CPP) by means of specific modulation of astrocytic MOR, an exemplar endogenous Gi protein-coupled receptor (Gi-GPCR), in the CA1 hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a subthreshold stimulation with the activation of astrocytic MOR at the Schaffer collateral pathway accounts for the memory acquisition to induce CPP. This astrocytic MOR-mediated LTP induction is dependent on astrocytic glutamate released upon activation of the astrocytic MOR and the consequent activation of the presynaptic mGluR1. The astrocytic MOR-dependent LTP and CPP were recapitulated by a chemogenetic activation of astrocyte-specifically expressed Gi-DREADD hM4Di. Our study reveals that the transduction of inhibitory Gi-signaling into augmented excitatory synaptic transmission through astrocytic glutamate is critical for the acquisition of contextual memory for CPP.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise engages signaling networks to control the release of circulating factors beneficial to health. However, the nature of these networks remains undefined. Using high-throughput phosphoproteomics, we quantify 20,249 phosphorylation sites in skeletal muscle-like myotube cells and monitor their responses to a panel of cell stressors targeting aspects of exercise signaling in vivo. Integrating these in-depth phosphoproteomes with the phosphoproteome of acute aerobic exercise in human skeletal muscle suggests that co-administration of β-adrenergic and calcium agonists would activate complementary signaling relevant to this exercise context. The phosphoproteome of cells treated with this combination reveals a surprising divergence in signaling from the individual treatments. Remarkably, only the combination treatment promotes multisite phosphorylation of SERBP1, a regulator of Serpine1 mRNA stability, a pro-fibrotic secreted protein. Secretome analysis reveals that the combined treatments decrease secretion of SERPINE1 and other deleterious factors. This study provides a framework for dissecting phosphorylation-based signaling relevant to acute exercise.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic genomes, heterochromatin is targeted by RNAi machinery and/or by pathways requiring RNA elimination and transcription termination factors. However, a direct connection between termination machinery and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional activity at heterochromatic loci has remained elusive. Here, we show that, in fission yeast, the conserved cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) is a key component involved in RNAi-independent assembly of constitutive and facultative heterochromatin domains and that CPF is broadly required to silence genes regulated by Clr4SUV39H. Remarkably, CPF is recruited to non-canonical termination sites within the body of genes by the YTH family RNA-binding protein Mmi1 and is required for RNAPII transcription termination and facultative heterochromatin assembly. CPF loading by Mmi1 also promotes the selective termination of long non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in cis. These analyses delineate a mechanism in which CPF loaded onto non-canonical termination sites specifies targets of heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells are a specialized suppressive subset that controls the germinal center (GC) response and maintains humoral self-tolerance. The mechanisms that maintain TFR lineage identity and suppressive activity remain largely unknown. Here, we show that expression of Blimp1 by FoxP3+ TFR cells is essential for TFR lineage stability, entry into the GC, and expression of regulatory activity. Deletion of Blimp1 in TFR cells reduced FoxP3 and CTLA-4 expression and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and spontaneous production of autoantibodies, including elevated IgE. Maintenance of TFR stability reflected Blimp1-dependent repression of the IL-23R-STAT3 axis and activation of the CD25-STAT5 pathway, while silenced IL-23R-STAT3 or increased STAT5 activation rescued the Blimp1-deficient TFR phenotype. Blimp1-dependent control of CXCR5/CCR7 expression also regulated TFR homing into the GC. These findings uncover a Blimp1-dependent TFR checkpoint that enforces suppressive activity and acts as a gatekeeper of GC entry.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated calcium channels are exquisitely Ca2+ selective, conferred primarily by four conserved pore-loop glutamate residues contributing to the selectivity filter. There has been little previous work directly measuring whether the trafficking of calcium channels requires their ability to bind Ca2+ in the selectivity filter or to conduct Ca2+. Here, we examine trafficking of neuronal CaV2.1 and 2.2 channels with mutations in their selectivity filter and find reduced trafficking to the cell surface in cell lines. Furthermore, in hippocampal neurons, there is reduced trafficking to the somatic plasma membrane, into neurites, and to presynaptic terminals. However, the CaV2.2 selectivity filter mutants are still influenced by auxiliary α2δ subunits and, albeit to a reduced extent, by β subunits, indicating the channels are not grossly misfolded. Our results indicate that Ca2+ binding in the pore of CaV2 channels may promote their correct trafficking, in combination with auxiliary subunits. Furthermore, physiological studies utilizing selectivity filter mutant CaV channels should be interpreted with caution.

Abstract: Summary
In the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA), CD4+ T cells promote pro-inflammatory effector functions by shunting glucose away from glycolysis and ATP production. Underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and here we implicate the DNA repair nuclease MRE11A in the cells’ bioenergetic failure. MRE11A deficiency in RA T cells disrupted mitochondrial oxygen consumption and suppressed ATP generation. Also, MRE11A loss of function caused leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol, triggering inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptotic cell death. Caspase-1 activation was frequent in lymph-node-residing T cells in RA patients. In vivo, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of MRE11A resulted in tissue deposition of mtDNA, caspase-1 proteolysis, and aggressive tissue inflammation. Conversely, MRE11A overexpression restored mitochondrial fitness and shielded tissue from inflammatory attack. Thus, the nuclease MRE11A regulates a mitochondrial protection program, and MRE11A deficiency leads to DNA repair defects, energy production, and failure and loss of tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Extra-cranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) and cranial atypical teratoid RTs (ATRTs) are heterogeneous pediatric cancers driven primarily by SMARCB1 loss. To understand the genome-wide molecular relationships between MRTs and ATRTs, we analyze multi-omics data from 140 MRTs and 161 ATRTs. We detect similarities between the MYC subgroup of ATRTs (ATRT-MYC) and extra-cranial MRTs, including global DNA hypomethylation and overexpression of HOX genes and genes involved in mesenchymal development, distinguishing them from other ATRT subgroups that express neural-like features. We identify five DNA methylation subgroups associated with anatomical sites and SMARCB1 mutation patterns. Groups 1, 3, and 4 exhibit cytotoxic T cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoint regulators, consistent with a potential role for immunotherapy in rhabdoid tumor patients.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and bi-functional lipid and protein phosphatase. We report that the metabolic regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDHK1) is a synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancer and normal cells. The PTEN protein phosphatase dephosphorylates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-activating protein (NKAP) and limits NFκB activation to suppress expression of PDHK1, a NF-κB target gene. Loss of the PTEN protein phosphatase upregulates PDHK1 to induce aerobic glycolysis and PDHK1 cellular dependence. PTEN-deficient human tumors harbor increased PDHK1, a biomarker of decreased patient survival. This study uncovers a PTEN-regulated signaling pathway and reveals PDHK1 as a potential target in PTEN-deficient cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-derived lactic acid inhibits T and natural killer (NK) cell function and, thereby, tumor immunosurveillance. Here, we report that melanoma patients with high expression of glycolysis-related genes show a worse progression free survival upon anti-PD1 treatment. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T cell killing in vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of glycolysis in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy. These findings support the rationale for targeting glycolysis in patients with high glycolytic tumors together with checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 uses the microtubule network to traffic the viral capsid core toward the nucleus. Viral nuclear trafficking and infectivity require the kinesin-1 adaptor protein FEZ1. Here, we demonstrate that FEZ1 directly interacts with the HIV-1 capsid and specifically binds capsid protein (CA) hexamers. FEZ1 contains multiple acidic, poly-glutamate stretches that interact with the positively charged central pore of CA hexamers. The FEZ1-capsid interaction directly competes with nucleotides and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) that bind at the same location. In addition, all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations establish the molecular details of FEZ1-capsid interactions. Functionally, mutation of the FEZ1 capsid-interacting residues significantly reduces trafficking of HIV-1 particles toward the nucleus and early infection. These findings support a model in which the central capsid hexamer pore is a general HIV-1 cofactor-binding hub and FEZ1 serves as a unique CA hexamer pattern sensor to recognize this site and promote capsid trafficking in the cell.

Abstract: The yeast cell wall is composed of mannoproteins, β-1,3/β-1, 6-glucans and chitin. Each of these components has technological properties that are relevant for industrial and medical applications. To address issues related to cell wall structure and alteration in response to stress or conditioning processes, AFM dendritips were functionalized with biomolecules that are specific for each of the wall components, which was wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for chitin, concanavalin A (ConA) for mannans and anti-β-1,3/anti-β-1,6-glucan antibodies for β-1,3/β-1,6-glucans. Binding specificity of these biomolecules were validated using penta-N-acetylchitopentaose, α-mannans, laminarin (short β-1,3-glucan chain) and gentiobiose (2 glucose units linked in β 1→6) immobilized on epoxy glass slides. Dynamic force spectroscopy was employed to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information on the intermolecular interaction of the binary complexes using the model of Friddle-Noy-de Yoreo. Using this model, transition state distance xt, dissociate rate koff and the lowest force (feq) required to break the intermolecular bond of the complexes were approximated. These functionalized dendritips were then used to probe the yeast cell surface treated with a bacterial protease. As expected, this treatment, which removed the outer layer of the cell wall, gave accessibility to the inner layer composed of β-glucans. Likewise, bud scars were nicely localized using AFM dendritip bearing the WGA probe. To conclude, these functionalized AFM dendritips constitute a new toolbox that can be used to investigate cell surface structure and organization in response to a wide arrays of cultures and process conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Brain state fluctuations modulate sensory processing, but the factors governing state-dependent neural activity remain unclear. Here, we tracked the dynamics of cortical extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]o) during awake state transitions and manipulated [K+]o in slices, during visual processing, and during skilled motor execution. When mice transitioned from quiescence to locomotion, [K+]o increased by 0.6−1.0 mM in all cortical areas analyzed, and this preceded locomotion by 1 s. Emulating the state-dependent [K+]o increase in cortical slices caused neuronal depolarization and enhanced input-output transformation. In vivo, locomotion increased the gain of visually evoked responses in layer 2/3 of visual cortex; this effect was recreated by imposing a [K+]o increase. Elevating [K+]o in the motor cortex increased movement-induced neuronal spiking in layer 5 and improved motor performance. Thus, [K+]o increases in a cortex-wide state-dependent manner, and this [K+]o increase affects both sensory and motor processing through the dynamic modulation of neural activity.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in aggressive cancers. We show that the disruption of RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) in ALT+ cancer cells leads to generational telomere shortening. This is due to RAD51AP1’s involvement in RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) and RAD52-POLD3-dependent break induced DNA synthesis. RAD51AP1 KO ALT+ cells exhibit telomere dysfunction and cytosolic telomeric DNA fragments that are sensed by cGAS. Intriguingly, they activate ULK1-ATG7-dependent autophagy as a survival mechanism to mitigate DNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, RAD51AP1 protein levels are elevated in ALT+ cells due to MMS21 associated SUMOylation. Mutation of a single SUMO-targeted lysine residue perturbs telomere dynamics. These findings indicate that RAD51AP1 is an essential mediator of the ALT mechanism and is co-opted by post-translational mechanisms to maintain telomere length and ensure proliferation of ALT+ cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Acute itch can be generated by either chemical or mechanical stimuli, which activate separate pathways in the periphery and spinal cord. While substantial progress has been made in mapping the transmission pathway for chemical itch, the central pathway for mechanical itch remains obscure. Using complementary genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we show that excitatory neurons marked by the expression of the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1Cre neurons) form an essential pathway in the dorsal spinal cord for the transmission of mechanical but not chemical itch. Ablating or silencing the Y1Cre neurons abrogates mechanical itch, while chemogenetic activation induces scratching. Moreover, using Y1 conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) acts via dorsal-horn Y1-expressing neurons to suppress light punctate touch and mechanical itch stimuli. NPY-Y1 signaling thus regulates the transmission of innocuous tactile information by establishing biologically relevant thresholds for touch discrimination and mechanical itch reflexes.

Abstract: Summary
Histone methylation is essential for regulating gene expression during organogenesis to maintain stem cells and execute a proper differentiation program for their descendants. Here we show that the COMPASS family histone methyltransferase co-factor ASH2L is required for maintaining neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the production and positioning of projection neurons during neocortex development. Specifically, loss of Ash2l in NPCs results in malformation of the neocortex; the mutant neocortex has fewer neurons, which are also abnormal in composition and laminar position. Moreover, ASH2L loss impairs trimethylation of H3K4 and the transcriptional machinery specific for Wnt-β-catenin signaling, inhibiting the proliferation ability of NPCs at late stages of neurogenesis by disrupting S phase entry to inhibit cell cycle progression. Overexpressing β-catenin after ASH2L elimination rescues the proliferation deficiency. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ASH2L is crucial for modulating Wnt signaling to maintain NPCs and generate a full complement of neurons during mammalian neocortex development.

Abstract: Summary
KCC2 regulates neuronal transmembrane chloride gradients and thereby controls GABA signaling in the brain. KCC2 downregulation is observed in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Paradoxical, excitatory GABA signaling is usually assumed to contribute to abnormal network activity underlying the pathology. We tested this hypothesis and explored the functional impact of chronic KCC2 downregulation in the rat dentate gyrus. Although the reversal potential of GABAA receptor currents is depolarized in KCC2 knockdown neurons, this shift is compensated by depolarization of the resting membrane potential. This reflects downregulation of leak potassium currents. We show KCC2 interacts with Task-3 (KCNK9) channels and is required for their membrane expression. Increased neuronal excitability upon KCC2 suppression altered dentate gyrus rhythmogenesis, which could be normalized by chemogenetic hyperpolarization. Our data reveal KCC2 downregulation engages complex synaptic and cellular alterations beyond GABA signaling that perturb network activity thus offering additional targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
The brain faces the difficult task of maintaining a stable representation of key features of the outside world in noisy sensory surroundings. How does the sensory representation change with noise, and how does the brain make sense of it? We investigated the effect of background white noise (WN) on tuning properties of neurons in mouse A1 and its impact on discrimination performance in a go/no-go task. We find that WN suppresses the activity of A1 neurons, which surprisingly increases the discriminability of tones spectrally close to each other. To confirm the involvement of A1, we optogenetically excited parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons in A1, which have similar effects as WN on both tuning properties and frequency discrimination. A population model suggests that the suppression of A1 tuning curves increases frequency selectivity and thereby improves discrimination. Our findings demonstrate that the cortical representation of pure tones adapts during noise to improve sensory acuity.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests that Polycomb (Pc) is present at chromatin loop anchors in Drosophila. Pc is recruited to DNA through interactions with the GAGA binding factors GAF and Pipsqueak (Psq). Using HiChIP in Drosophila cells, we find that the psq gene, which has diverse roles in development and tumorigenesis, encodes distinct isoforms with unanticipated roles in genome 3D architecture. The BR-C, ttk, and bab domain (BTB)-containing Psq isoform (PsqL) colocalizes genome-wide with known architectural proteins. Conversely, Psq lacking the BTB domain (PsqS) is consistently found at Pc loop anchors and at active enhancers, including those that respond to the hormone ecdysone. After stimulation by this hormone, chromatin 3D organization is altered to connect promoters and ecdysone-responsive enhancers bound by PsqS. Our findings link Psq variants lacking the BTB domain to Pc-bound active enhancers, thus shedding light into their molecular function in chromatin changes underlying the response to hormone stimulus.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that enable immune evasion at metastatic sites are poorly understood. We show that the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) drives colonization of the bones and visceral organs in double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC). In vivo genetic screening identifies CCL2 as the top prometastatic gene induced by PRC1. CCL2 governs self-renewal and induces the recruitment of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells, thus coordinating metastasis initiation with immune suppression and neoangiogenesis. A catalytic inhibitor of PRC1 cooperates with immune checkpoint therapy to reverse these processes and suppress metastasis in genetically engineered mouse transplantation models of DNPC. These results reveal that PRC1 coordinates stemness with immune evasion and neoangiogenesis and point to the potential clinical utility of targeting PRC1 in DNPC.

Abstract: Summary
During symmetry breaking, the highly conserved Rho GTPase Cdc42 becomes stabilized at a defined site via an amplification process. However, little is known about how a new polarity site is established in an already asymmetric cell—a critical process in a changing environment. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from budding to filamentous growth in response to external cues, a transition controlled by Cdc42. Here, we have used optogenetic manipulation of cell polarity to reset growth in asymmetric filamentous C. albicans cells. We show that increasing the level of active Cdc42 on the plasma membrane results in disruption of the exocyst subunit Sec3 localization and a striking de novo clustering of secretory vesicles. This new cluster of secretory vesicles is highly dynamic, moving by hops and jumps, until a new growth site is established. Our results reveal that secretory vesicle clustering can occur in the absence of directional growth.

Abstract: Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus has been shown to inhibit the innate immune response by blocking the induction of interferon (IFN). In this study, we isolated two single-stranded RNA aptamers specific to NS1 with Kd values of 1.62 ± 0.30 nM and 1.97 ± 0.27 nM, respectively, using a systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The selected aptamers were able to inhibit the interaction of NS1 with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), and suppression of NS1 enabled retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) to be ubiquitinated regularly by TRIM25. Additional luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that suppression of NS1 by the selected aptamers induced IFN production. It is noted that viral replication was also inhibited through IFN induction in the presence of the selected aptamers. These results suggest that the isolated aptamers are strongly expected to be new therapeutic agents against influenza infection.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) cause Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) to spread over broad regions of the mammalian genome. We report that in mouse trophoblast stem cells, the Airn and Kcnq1ot1 lncRNAs induce PRC-dependent chromatin modifications over multi-megabase domains. Throughout the Airn-targeted domain, the extent of PRC-dependent modification correlated with intra-nuclear distance to the Airn locus, preexisting genome architecture, and the abundance of Airn itself. Specific CpG islands (CGIs) displayed characteristics indicating that they nucleate the spread of PRCs upon exposure to Airn. Chromatin environments surrounding Xist, Airn, and Kcnq1ot1 suggest common mechanisms of PRC engagement and spreading. Our data indicate that lncRNA potency can be tightly linked to lncRNA abundance and that within lncRNA-targeted domains, PRCs are recruited to CGIs via lncRNA-independent mechanisms. We propose that CGIs that autonomously recruit PRCs interact with lncRNAs and their associated proteins through three-dimensional space to nucleate the spread of PRCs in lncRNA-targeted domains.

Abstract: Summary
It is known that lethal viruses profoundly manipulate host metabolism, but how the metabolism alternation affects the immediate host antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that the O-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), a key mediator of interferon signaling, is a critical regulation to activate the host innate immunity against RNA viruses. We show that O-GlcNAcylation depletion in myeloid cells renders the host more susceptible to virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MAVS O-GlcNAcylation is required for virus-induced MAVS K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby facilitating IRF3 activation and IFNβ production. We further demonstrate that D-glucosamine, a commonly used dietary supplement, effectively protects mice against a range of lethal RNA viruses, including human influenza virus. Our study highlights a critical role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating host antiviral immunity and validates D-glucosamine as a potential therapeutic for virus infections.

Abstract: Summary
Iterative liver injury results in progressive fibrosis disrupting hepatic architecture, regeneration potential, and liver function. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of pathological matrix during fibrosis and are thought to be a functionally homogeneous population. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to deconvolve the hepatic mesenchyme in healthy and fibrotic mouse liver, revealing spatial zonation of HSCs across the hepatic lobule. Furthermore, we show that HSCs partition into topographically diametric lobule regions, designated portal vein-associated HSCs (PaHSCs) and central vein-associated HSCs (CaHSCs). Importantly we uncover functional zonation, identifying CaHSCs as the dominant pathogenic collagen-producing cells in a mouse model of centrilobular fibrosis. Finally, we identify LPAR1 as a therapeutic target on collagen-producing CaHSCs, demonstrating that blockade of LPAR1 inhibits liver fibrosis in a rodent NASH model. Taken together, our work illustrates the power of single-cell transcriptomics to resolve the key collagen-producing cells driving liver fibrosis with high precision.

Abstract: Here we report the structure of the widely utilized calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN93 bound to the Ca2+-sensing protein CaM. KN93 is widely believed to inhibit CaMKII by binding to the kinase. The CaM-KN93 interaction is significant as it can interfere with the interaction between CaM and it's physiological targets, thereby raising the possibility of ascribing modified protein function to CaMKII phosphorylation while concealing a CaM–protein interaction. NMR spectroscopy, stopped-flow kinetic measurements, and x-ray crystallography were used to characterize the structure and biophysical properties of the CaM-KN93 interaction. We then investigated the functional properties of the cardiac Na+ channel (NaV1.5) and ryanodine receptor (RyR2). We find that KN93 disrupts a high affinity CaM-NaV1.5 interaction and alters channel function independent of CaMKII. Moreover, KN93 increases RyR2 Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes independent of CaMKII. Therefore, when interpreting KN93 data, targets other than CaMKII need to be considered.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate innate immunity via interactions between their Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain and downstream adaptor proteins. Here we report that Salmonella Enteritidis produces a secreted protein (TcpS) that contains both a TIR domain and a coiled-coil domain. TcpS blocks MyD88- and TRIF-mediated TLR signaling, inhibits inflammatory responses, and promotes bacterial survival. Early-stage immune evasion by TcpS results in severe tissue damage in the late stage of infection and contributes to Salmonella virulence. TcpS-derived peptides inhibit nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-elicited systemic inflammation. Therapeutic peptide administration alleviates weight loss of mice infected with H1N1 influenza. Importantly, maximal TcpS-mediated TLR inhibition requires the critical TIR-TcpS residues Y191 and I284, as well as TcpS homodimerization via its N-terminal coiled-coil domain. Our study unveils a mechanism in which TcpS suppresses innate immunity via both its homodimerization and interaction with MyD88. TcpS is also a potential therapeutic agent for inflammation-associated diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Governance of protein phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases constitutes an essential regulatory network in eukaryotic cells. Network dysregulation leads to severe consequences and is often a key factor in disease pathogenesis. Previous studies revealed multiple roles for protein phosphorylation and pathway structures in cellular functions from different perspectives. We seek to understand the roles of kinases and phosphatases from a protein homeostasis point of view. Using a streamlined tandem mass tag (SL-TMT) strategy, we systematically measure proteomic and phosphoproteomic responses to perturbations of phosphorylation signaling networks in yeast deletion strains. Our results emphasize the requirement for protein normalization for more complete interpretation of phosphorylation data. Functional relationships between kinases and phosphatases were characterized at both proteome and phosphoproteome levels in three ways: (1) Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, (2) Δgene-Δgene correlation networks, and (3) molecule covariance networks. This resource illuminates kinase and phosphatase functions and pathway organizations.

Abstract: Summary
We previously identified a unique population of interstitial muscle progenitors, marked by expression of the Twist2 transcription factor, which fuses specifically to type IIb/x fast-twitch myofibers. Tw2+ progenitors are distinct from satellite cells, a muscle progenitor that expresses Pax7 and contributes to all myofiber types. Through RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence, we identify the membrane receptor, Nrp1, as a marker of Tw2+ cells but not Pax7+ cells. We also found that Sema3a, a chemorepellent ligand for Nrp1, is expressed by type I and IIa myofibers but not IIb myofibers. Using stripe migration assays, chimeric cell-cell fusion assays, and a Sema3a transgenic mouse model, we identify Sema3a-Nrp1 signaling as a major mechanism for Tw2+ cell fiber-type specificity. Our findings reveal an extracellular signaling mechanism whereby a cell-surface receptor for a chemorepellent confers specificity of intercellular fusion of a specific muscle progenitor with its target tissue.

Abstract: Summary
The cortex and thalamus send excitatory projections to the striatum, but little is known about how these inputs, either individually or collectively, regulate striatal dynamics during behavior. The lateral striatum receives overlapping input from the secondary motor cortex (M2), an area involved in licking, and the parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF). Using neural recordings, together with optogenetic terminal inhibition, we examine the contribution of M2 and PF projections on medium spiny projection neuron (MSN) activity as mice performed an anticipatory licking task. Each input has a similar contribution to striatal activity. By comparing how suppressing single or multiple projections altered striatal activity, we find that cortical and thalamic input signals modulate MSN gain and that this effect is more pronounced in a temporally specific period of the task following the cue presentation. These results demonstrate that cortical and thalamic inputs synergistically regulate striatal output during reward-conditioned behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue browning and systemic energy expenditure provide a defense mechanism against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. In high-cholesterol Western diet-fed mice, mast cell (MC) inactivation ameliorates obesity and insulin resistance and improves the metabolic rate, but a direct role of adipose tissue MCs in thermogenesis and browning remains unproven. Here, we report that adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine-stimulated metabolic rate and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) browning are enhanced in MC-deficient Kitw-sh/w-sh mice and MC-stabilized wild-type mice on a chow diet. MC reconstitution to SAT in Kitw-sh/w-sh mice blocks these changes. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MC inactivation elevates SAT platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRα+) adipocyte precursor proliferation and accelerates beige adipocyte differentiation. Using the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) inhibitor and TPH1-deficient MCs, we show that MC-derived serotonin inhibits SAT browning and systemic energy expenditure. Functional inactivation of MCs or inhibition of MC serotonin synthesis in SAT promotes adipocyte browning and systemic energy metabolism in mice.

Abstract: Over proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) disturbs mesangial homeostasis and leads to renal damage in mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. It is documented that transcriptional factors may be involved in the proliferation of MCs. This study aims to identify the key transcriptional factor that prevents the MCs from over proliferation and to clarify its regulatory mechanism. Microarray analysis of glomeruli isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) with or without anti-Thy1 nephritis (anti-Thy1N) showed that the cell cycle pathway was the most enriched pathway in anti-Thy1N model, and the D-site binding protein (DBP) ranked first in the cluster of transcription factors. Compare with normal rats, DBP is markedly decreased accompanied by an over proliferation of MCs in rats with anti-Thy1N. The cell proliferative capacity was measured by 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay in primary rat MCs with DBP knockdown or overexpression, respectively. The results showed that the knockdown of DBP significantly promoted the proliferation of MCs, whereas the overexpression of DBP inhibited the MCs’ proliferation, compared to that of the control cells. Further study indicated that DBP arrested G1/S-phase transition by inhibiting the expression of p21, p27 and inducing the Cyclin D1 expression in MCs. The current data suggest that DBP effectively inhibits the proliferation of MCs through G1 phase arrest, and the decrease of DBP may induce mesangial over proliferation in rats with anti-Thy1N.

Abstract: Summary
Type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze asymmetric dimethylation of arginines on proteins. Type I PRMTs and their substrates have been implicated in human cancers, suggesting inhibition of type I PRMTs may offer a therapeutic approach for oncology. The current report describes GSK3368715 (EPZ019997), a potent, reversible type I PRMT inhibitor with anti-tumor effects in human cancer models. Inhibition of PRMT5, the predominant type II PRMT, produces synergistic cancer cell growth inhibition when combined with GSK3368715. Interestingly, deletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene (MTAP) results in accumulation of the metabolite 2-methylthioadenosine, an endogenous inhibitor of PRMT5, and correlates with sensitivity to GSK3368715 in cell lines. These data provide rationale to explore MTAP status as a biomarker strategy for patient selection.

Abstract: Summary
Analyses of HIV-1 envelope (Env) binding to CD4, and the conformational changes the interactions induce, inform the molecular mechanisms and factors governing HIV-1 infection. To address these questions, we used a single-molecule detection (SMD) approach to study the nature of reactions between soluble CD4 (sCD4) and soluble HIV-1 trimers. SMD of these reactions distinguished a mixture of one, two, or three CD4-bound trimer species. Single-ligand trimers were favored at early reaction times and ligand-saturated trimers later. Furthermore, some trimers occupied by one sCD4 molecule did not bind additional ligands, whereas the majority of two ligand-bound species rapidly transitioned to the saturated state. Quantification of liganded trimers observed in reactions with various sCD4 concentrations reflected an overall negative cooperativity in ligand binding. Collectively, our results highlight the general utility of SMD in studying protein interactions and provide critical insights on the nature of sCD4-HIV-1 Env interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cell (DC) activation is a critical step for anti-tumor T cell responses. Certain chemotherapeutics can influence DC function. Here we demonstrate that chemotherapy capable of microtubule destabilization has direct effects on DC function; namely, it induces potent DC maturation and elicits anti-tumor immunity. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1) is specifically released upon microtubule destabilization and is required for DC activation. In response to chemotherapy, GEF-H1 drives a distinct cell signaling program in DCs dominated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and AP-1/ATF transcriptional response for control of innate and adaptive immune responses. Microtubule destabilization, and subsequent GEF-H1 signaling, enhances cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8 T cells. In absence of GEF-H1, anti-tumor immunity is hampered. In cancer patients, high expression of the GEF-H1 immune gene signature is associated with prolonged survival. Our study identifies an alternate intracellular axis in DCs induced upon microtubule destabilization in which GEF-H1 promotes protective anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
DLX transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of the developing vertebrate brain, driving forebrain GABAergic neuronal differentiation. Ablation of Dlx1&2 alters expression of genes that are critical for forebrain GABAergic development. We integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses, complemented with in situ hybridization (ISH), and in vivo and in vitro studies of regulatory element (RE) function. This revealed the DLX-organized gene regulatory network at genomic, cellular, and spatial levels in mouse embryonic basal ganglia. DLX TFs perform dual activating and repressing functions; the consequences of their binding were determined by the sequence and genomic context of target loci. Our results reveal and, in part, explain the paradox of widespread DLX binding contrasted with a limited subset of target loci that are sensitive at the epigenomic and transcriptomic level to Dlx1&2 ablation. The regulatory properties identified here for DLX TFs suggest general mechanisms by which TFs orchestrate dynamic expression programs underlying neurodevelopment.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to defense against foreign DNA, the CRISPR-Cas9 system of Francisella novicida represses expression of an endogenous immunostimulatory lipoprotein. We investigated the specificity and molecular mechanism of this regulation, demonstrating that Cas9 controls a highly specific regulon of four genes that must be repressed for bacterial virulence. Regulation occurs through a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent interaction of Cas9 with its endogenous DNA targets, dependent on a non-canonical small RNA (scaRNA) and tracrRNA. The limited complementarity between scaRNA and the endogenous DNA targets precludes cleavage, highlighting the evolution of scaRNA to repress transcription without lethally targeting the chromosome. We show that scaRNA can be reprogrammed to repress other genes, and with engineered, extended complementarity to an exogenous target, the repurposed scaRNA:tracrRNA-FnoCas9 machinery can also direct DNA cleavage. Natural Cas9 transcriptional interference likely represents a broad paradigm of regulatory functionality, which is potentially critical to the physiology of numerous Cas9-encoding pathogenic and commensal organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Organ regeneration is preceded by the recruitment of innate immune cells, which play an active role during repair and regrowth. Here, we studied macrophage subtypes during organ regeneration in the zebrafish, an animal model with a high regenerative capacity. We identified a macrophage subpopulation expressing Wilms tumor 1b (wt1b), which accumulates within regenerating tissues. This wt1b+ macrophage population exhibited an overall pro-regenerative gene expression profile and different migratory behavior compared to the remainder of the macrophages. Functional studies showed that wt1b regulates macrophage migration and retention at the injury area. Furthermore, wt1b-null mutant zebrafish presented signs of impaired macrophage differentiation, delayed fin growth upon caudal fin amputation, and reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation following cardiac injury that correlated with altered macrophage recruitment to the regenerating areas. We describe a pro-regenerative macrophage subtype in the zebrafish and a role for wt1b in organ regeneration.

Abstract: Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) is one of the key enzymes of the L-serine synthesis pathway. PSPH is reported to affect the progression and survival of several cancers in an L-serine synthesis-independent manner, but the mechanism remains elusive. We demonstrate that PSPH promotes lung cancer progression through a noncanonical L-serine-independent pathway. PSPH was significantly associated with the prognosis of lung cancer patients and regulated the invasion and colony formation of lung cancer cells. Interestingly, L-serine had no effect on the altered invasion and colony formation by PSPH. Upon measuring the phosphatase activity of PSPH on a serine-phosphorylated peptide, we found that PSPH dephosphorylated phospho-serine in peptide sequences. To identify the target proteins of PSPH, we analyzed the protein phosphorylation profile and the PSPH-interacting protein profile using proteomic analyses and found one putative target protein, IRS-1. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays validated a specific interaction between PSPH and IRS-1 and the dephosphorylation of phospho-IRS-1 by PSPH in lung cancer cells. We suggest that the specific interaction and dephosphorylation activity of PSPH have novel therapeutic potential for lung cancer treatment, while the metabolic activity of PSPH, as a therapeutic target, is controversial.
