Abstract: Androgen receptor (AR) is widely expressed in breast cancer; however, there is limited information on the key molecular functions and gene targets of AR in this disease. In this study, gene expression data from a cohort of 52 breast cancer cell lines was analyzed to identify a network of AR co-expressed genes. A total of 300 genes, which were significantly enriched for cell cycle and metabolic functions, showed absolute correlation coefficients (|CC|) of more than 0.5 with AR expression across the dataset. In this network, a subset of 35 “AR-signature” genes were highly co-expressed with AR (|CC|>0.6) that included transcriptional regulators PATZ1, NFATC4, and SPDEF. Furthermore, gene encoding coagulation factor VII (F7) demonstrated the closest expression pattern with AR (CC=0.716) in the dataset and factor VII protein expression was significantly associated to that of AR in a cohort of 209 breast tumors. Moreover, functional studies demonstrated that AR activation results in the induction of factor VII expression at both transcript and protein levels and AR directly binds to a proximal region of F7 promoter in breast cancer cells. Importantly, AR activation in breast cancer cells induced endogenous factor VII activity to convert factor X to Xa in conjunction with tissue factor. In summary, F7 is a novel AR target gene and AR activation regulates the ectopic expression and activity of factor VII in breast cancer cells. These findings have functional implications in the pathobiology of thromboembolic events and regulation of factor VII/tissue factor signaling in breast cancer.

Abstract: We have previously reported a unique response of traction force generation for cells grown on mature cardiac ECM, where traction force was constant over a range of stiffnesses. In this study we sought to further investigate the role of the complex mixture of ECM on this response and assess the potential mechanism behind it. Using traction force microscopy, we measured cellular traction forces and stresses for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) grown on polyacrylamide gels at a range of stiffnesses (9, 25, or 48kPa) containing either adult rat heart ECM, different singular ECM proteins including collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin, or ECM mimics comprised of varying amounts of collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin. We also measured the expression of integrins on these different substrates as well as probed for β1 integrin binding. There was no significant change in traction force generation for cells grown on the adult ECM, as previously reported, whereas cells grown on singular ECM protein substrates had increased traction force generation with an increase in substrate stiffness. Cells grown on ECM mimics containing collagen I, fibronectin and laminin were found to be reminiscent of the traction forces generated by cells grown on native ECM. Integrin expression generally increased with increasing stiffness except for the β1 integrin, potentially implicating it as playing a role in the response to adult cardiac ECM. We inhibited binding through the β1 integrin on cells grown on the adult ECM and found that the inhibition of β1 binding led to a return to the typical response of increasing traction force generation with increasing stiffness. Our data demonstrates that cells grown on the mature cardiac ECM are able to circumvent typical stiffness related cellular behaviors, likely through β1 integrin binding to the complex composition.

Abstract: Background
We have reported that triptolide can inhibit airway remodeling in a murine model of asthma via TGF-β1/Smad signaling. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of triptolide on airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) proliferation and the possible mechanism.
Methods
Rat airway smooth muscle cells were cultured and made synchronized, then pretreated with different concentration of triptolide before stimulated by TGF-β1. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to study the influence of triptolide on cell cycle and apoptosis. Signal proteins (Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7) were detected by western blotting analysis.
Results
Triptolide significantly inhibited TGF-β1-induced ASMC proliferation (P<0.05). The cell cycle was blocked at G1/S-interphase by triptolide dose dependently. No pro-apoptotic effects were detected under the concentration of triptolide we used. Western blotting analysis showed TGF-β1 induced Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation was inhibited by triptolide pretreatment, and the level of Smad7 was increased by triptolide pretreatment.
Conclusions
Triptolide may function as an inhibitor of asthma airway remodeling by suppressing ASMCs proliferation via negative regulation of Smad signaling pathway.

Abstract: The marmoset is an important nonhuman primate model for regenerative medicine. For experimental autologous cell therapy based on induced pluripotent (iPS) cells in the marmoset, cells must be able to undergo robust and reliable directed differentiation that will not require customization for each specific iPS cell clone. When marmoset iPS cells were aggregated in a hanging drop format for 3days, followed by exposure to dual SMAD inhibitors and retinoic acid in monolayer culture for 3days, we found substantial variability in the response of different iPS cell clones. However, when clones were pretreated with 0.05–2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24hours, all clones showed a very similar maximal response to the directed differentiation scheme. Peak responses were observed at 0.5% DMSO in two clones and at 1% DMSO in a third clone. When patterns of gene expression were examined by microarray analysis, hierarchical clustering showed very similar responses in all 3 clones when they were pretreated with optimal DMSO concentrations. The change in phenotype following exposure to DMSO and the 6day hanging drop/monolayer treatment was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Analysis of DNA content in DMSO-exposed cells indicated that it is unlikely that DMSO acts by causing cells to exit from the cell cycle. This approach should be generally valuable in the directed neural differentiation of pluripotent cells for experimental cell therapy.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) protects cells against a variety of stressors, and multiple studies have suggested that Hsp72 plays a cardioprotective role. As skeletal muscle Hsp72 overexpression can protect against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance, alterations in substrate metabolism may be a mechanism by which Hsp72 is cardioprotective. We investigated the impact of transgenically overexpressing (Hsp72 Tg) or deleting Hsp72 (Hsp72 KO) on various aspects of cardiac metabolism. Mice were fed a normal chow (NC) or HFD for 12 weeks from 8 weeks of age to examine the impact of diet-induced obesity on metabolic parameters in the heart. The HFD resulted in an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation and a decrease in cardiac glucose oxidation and insulin-stimulated cardiac glucose clearance; however, there was no difference in Hsp72 Tg or Hsp72 KO mice in these rates compared with their respective wild-type control mice. Although HFD-induced cardiac insulin resistance was not rescued in the Hsp72 Tg mice, it was preserved in the skeletal muscle, suggesting tissue-specific effects of Hsp72 overexpression on substrate metabolism. Comparison of two different strains of mice (BALB/c vs. C57BL/6J) also identified strain-specific differences in regard to HFD-induced cardiac lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. These strain differences suggest that cardiac lipid accumulation can be dissociated from cardiac insulin resistance. Our study finds that genetic manipulation of Hsp72 does not lead to alterations in metabolic processes in cardiac tissue under resting conditions, but identifies mouse strain-specific differences in cardiac lipid accumulation and insulin-stimulated glucose clearance.

Abstract: Maintaining the genomic integrity is a constant challenge in proliferating cells. Amongst various proteins involved in this process, Sirtuins play a key role in DNA damage repair mechanisms in yeast as well as mammals. In the present work we report the role of one of the least explored Sirtuin viz., SIRT7, under conditions of genomic stress when treated with doxorubicin. Knockdown of SIRT7 sensitized osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells to DNA damage induced cell death by doxorubicin. SIRT7 overexpression in NIH3T3 delayed cell cycle progression by causing delay in G1 to S transition. SIRT7 overexpressing cells when treated with low dose of doxorubicin (0.25µM) showed delayed onset of senescence, lesser accumulation of DNA damage marker γH2AX and lowered levels of growth arrest markers viz., p53 and p21 when compared to doxorubicin treated control GFP expressing cells. Resistance to DNA damage following SIRT7 overexpression was also evident by EdU incorporation studies where cellular growth arrest was significantly delayed. When treated with higher dose of doxorubicin (>1µM), SIRT7 conferred resistance to apoptosis by attenuating stress activated kinases (SAPK viz., p38 and JNK) and p53 response thereby shifting the cellular fate towards senescence. Interestingly, relocalization of SIRT7 from nucleolus to nucleoplasm together with its co-localization with SAPK was an important feature associated with DNA damage. SIRT7 mediated resistance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis and senescence was lost when p53 level was restored by nutlin treatment. Overall, we propose SIRT7 attenuates DNA damage, SAPK activation and p53 response thereby promoting cellular survival under conditions of genomic stress.

Abstract: Electrospinning permits fabrication of biodegradable matrices that can resemble the both scale and mechanical behavior of the native extracellular matrix. However, achieving high-cellular density and infiltration of cells within matrices with traditional technique remain challenging and time consuming. The cell electrospinning technique presented in this paper can mitigate the problems associated with these limitations. Cells encapsulated by the material in the cell electrospinning technique survived well and distributed homogenously within the nanofibrous membrane, and their vitality was improved to 133% after being cultured for 28 days. The electrospun nanofibrous membrane has a certain degradation property and favorable cell–membrane interaction that supports the active biocompatibility of the membrane. Its properties are helpful for supporting cell attachment and growth, maintaining phenotypic shape, and secreting an ample amount of extracellular matrix (ECM). This novel membrane may be a potential application within the field of tissue engineering. The ability of cell electrospinning to microintegrate cells into a biodegradable fibrous matrix embodies a novel tissue engineering approach that could be applied to fabricate a high cell density elastic tissue mimetic.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by skeletal muscle cells after muscle overload contributes to ensuing regenerative and hypertrophic processes in skeletal muscle. The objective of the present study is to reveal mechanisms through which skeletal muscle cell expression of ICAM-1 augments regenerative and hypertrophic processes of myogenesis. This was accomplished by genetically engineering C2C12 myoblasts to stably express ICAM-1, and by inhibiting the adhesive and signaling functions of ICAM-1 through the use of a neutralizing antibody or cell penetrating peptide, respectively. Expression of ICAM-1 by cultured skeletal muscle cells augmented myoblast–myoblast adhesion, myotube formation, myonuclear number, myotube alignment, myotube–myotube fusion, and myotube size without influencing the ability of myoblasts to proliferate or differentiate. ICAM-1 augmented myotube formation, myonuclear accretion, and myotube alignment through a mechanism involving adhesion-induced activation of ICAM-1 signaling, as these dependent measures were reduced via antibody and peptide inhibition of ICAM-1. The adhesive and signaling functions of ICAM-1 also facilitated myotube hypertrophy through a mechanism involving myotube–myotube fusion, protein synthesis, and Akt/p70s6k signaling. Our findings demonstrate that ICAM-1 expression by skeletal muscle cells augments myogenesis, and establish a novel mechanism through which the inflammatory response facilitates growth processes in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Gamma-herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mRNA-targeting endonuclease, SOX, that cleaves most cellular mRNAs. Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5′-3′ mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.

Abstract: Functional selectivity, a process by which G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can activate one signaling route while avoiding another, is regulated by ligand-mediated stabilization of specific receptor states that modulate different downstream signaling events. We propose a novel mechanism for functional selectivity, induced by the endogenous P2Y2R agonist ATP and regulated at the signaling interface by the cytoskeleton. Upon ATP stimulation of human neutrophils, a transient rise in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ was not followed by activation of the superoxide anion-generating NADPH-oxidase. This was in contrast to signals generated through the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), as its activation was accompanied by both a mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of the NADPH-oxidase. The phospholipase C/Ca2+ signaling route is not modulated by the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug latrunculin A, but this drug was able to launch a new signaling route downstream of P2Y2R that led to NADPH-oxidase activation. The signaling downstream of P2Y2R was rapidly terminated and the receptors were desensitized; however, in contrast to desensitized FPR1, no P2Y2 receptor reactivation could be induced by latrunculin A. Thus, P2Y2R desensitization does not appear to involve the cytoskeleton, contrary to FPR1 desensitization. In summary, we hereby describe how ATP regulates functional selectivity via the cytoskeleton, leading to intracellular Ca2+ increase, alone or with simultaneous NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils.

Abstract: MiR-145 is downregulated and functions as a tumor suppressor in many malignancies. In this study, the biological function, molecular mechanism, and direct target genes of miR-145 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells were investigated. Cell survival was detected by cell viability assay, and cell cycle was determined through flow cytometry. Invasion and migration of NPC cells were examined using cell invasion and wound healing assays, respectively. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) was verified as the target of miR-145 through luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. In NPC cell lines, miR-145 expression was significantly downregulated and ADAM17 protein expression was upregulated. ADAM17 was downregulated at the post-transcriptional level by miR-145 via the binding site of ADAM17-3′UTR. Transfection with miR-145 mimic suppressed cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by upregulating key G0/G1 phase regulators, namely, p53 and p21. MiR-145 also inhibited cellular migration and invasion through targeting ADAM17 involving the regulation of EGFR and E-cadherin. Knockdown of ADAM17 elicited similar effects to that of miR-145 on NPC cells. This study reveals that miR-145 suppressed the invasion and migration of NPC cells by targeting ADAM17. Thus, miR-145 could be a therapeutic target for NPC.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma responses weakly to cisplatin. Mitochondrial dynamics participate in the response to various stresses, and mainly involve mitophagy and mitochondrial fusion and fission. Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in orchestrating mitochondrial dynamics, and are involved in the resistance to cisplatin. Here we reported that ABT737, combined with cisplatin, can promote cholangiocarcinoma cells to undergo apoptosis. We found that the combined treatment decreased the Mcl-1 pro-survival form and increased Bak. Cells undergoing cisplatin treatment showed hyperfused mitochondria, whereas fragmentation was dominant in the mitochondria of cells exposed to the combined treatment, with higher Fis1 levels, decreased Mfn2 and OPA1 levels, increased ratio of Drp1 60kD to 80kD form, and more Drp1 located on mitochondria. More p62 aggregates were observed in cells with fragmented mitochondria, and they gradually translocated to mitochondria. Mitophagy was induced by the combined treatment. Knockdown p62 decreased the Drp1 ratio, increased Tom20, and increased cell viability. Our data indicated that mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in the response of cholangiocarcinoma to cisplatin. ABT737 might enhance cholangiocarcinoma sensitivity to cisplatin through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the balance within Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, p62 seems to be critical in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has been successfully used to recapitulate phenotypic traits of several human diseases in vitro. Patient-specific iPSC-based disease models are also expected to reveal early functional phenotypes, although this remains to be proved. Here, we generated iPSC lines from two patients with Sanfilippo type C syndrome, a lysosomal storage disorder with inheritable progressive neurodegeneration. Mature neurons obtained from patient-specific iPSC lines recapitulated the main known phenotypes of the disease, not present in genetically corrected patient-specific iPSC-derived cultures. Moreover, neuronal networks organized in vitro from mature patient-derived neurons showed early defects in neuronal activity, network-wide degradation, and altered effective connectivity. Our findings establish the importance of iPSC-based technology to identify early functional phenotypes, which can in turn shed light on the pathological mechanisms occurring in Sanfilippo syndrome. This technology also has the potential to provide valuable readouts to screen compounds, which can prevent the onset of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Several systems-level datasets designed to dissect host-pathogen interactions during influenza A infection have been reported. However, apparent discordance among these data has hampered their full utility toward advancing mechanistic and therapeutic knowledge. To collectively reconcile these datasets, we performed a meta-analysis of data from eight published RNAi screens and integrated these data with three protein interaction datasets, including one generated within the context of this study. Further integration of these data with global virus-host interaction analyses revealed a functionally validated biochemical landscape of the influenza-host interface, which can be queried through a simplified and customizable web portal (http://www.metascape.org/IAV). Follow-up studies revealed that the putative ubiquitin ligase UBR4 associates with the viral M2 protein and promotes apical transport of viral proteins. Taken together, the integrative analysis of influenza OMICs datasets illuminates a viral-host network of high-confidence human proteins that are essential for influenza A virus replication.

Abstract: This case-control study aimed to investigate whether the levels of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and Hsp27 (HSPB1) in plasma and lymphocytes were associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among coal workers. A total of 76 COPD cases and 48 age-matched healthy controls from a group of coal workers were included. The case group consisted of 35 COPD patients whose condition was complicated with coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) and 41 COPD patients without CWP. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) in plasma and lymphocytes were detected by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to estimate the association between Hsp levels and COPD risk. Our results showed that plasma Hsp70 and lymphocyte Hsp27 levels were significantly higher and plasma Hsp27 levels were significantly lower in COPD cases than in controls (p < 0.01). No significant differences in lymphocyte Hsp70 levels were found between COPD cases and the matched subjects. Higher plasma Hsp70 levels (odds ratio (OR) = 13.8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5.7–33.5) and lower plasma Hsp27 levels (OR = 4.6, 95 % CI = 2.0–10.5) were significantly associated with an increased risk of COPD after adjusting for confounders. Higher lymphocyte Hsp27 levels were only associated with an increased risk of COPD with CWP (OR = 6.6, 95 % CI = 2.0–22.1) but not with an increased risk of COPD without CWP (OR = 3.0, 95 % CI = 0.9–8.9). Additionally, there were strong joint effects of different Hsps on COPD risk. These results showed that higher levels of plasma Hsp70 and lower levels of plasma Hsp27 might be associated with an increased risk of COPD among coal workers. They may have the potential to serve as monitoring markers for COPD in coal workers.

Abstract: Background
Treatment outcome of children with pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma (pHCC) is poor. Therefore, we evaluated the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib in a model of pHCC.
Methods
Cell viability after treatment with sorafenib was evaluated in HC-AFW1 cells (pHCC) using MTT assay and compared to an adult HCC (aHCC) and two hepatoblastoma (HB) cell lines. ERK, pERK, E-cadherin, and vimentin expression were investigated using Western Blot. Sorafenib (60mg/kg) was administered orally to NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid-IL2rgtmWjl/Sz mice bearing subcutaneous HC-AFW1-derived tumors. Tumor progression, viability, and vascularization were monitored by tumor volume, AFP levels, and CD31 immunostaining, respectively. Sensitization to sorafenib was evaluated using the β-catenin inhibitor ICG001.
Results
Sorafenib reduced cell viability in HC-AFW1 (IC50: 8µM), comparable to HB cells, however less pronounced in aHCC cells (IC50: 23µM). Sorafenib inhibited ERK signaling in both, HC-AFW1 cells and -xenografts. In vivo, sorafenib treatment only led to a moderate tumor growth inhibition, although significant reduction of vascularization and tumor growth kinetics was observed. Long-term treatment with sorafenib decreased E-cadherin, but showed no induction of vimentin expression. Combining sorafenib with a β-catenin inhibitor led to an additional reduction of cell viability.
Conclusion
Sorafenib together with inhibitors of the β-catenin pathway might be an effective tool in the treatment of pediatric HCC.

Abstract: Reactive astrocytosis has been considered either beneficial or detrimental effection in neuroinflammatory disease. HSPA12B, a new member belongs to the 70-kDa family of heat shock proteins (HSP70) which could modulate inflammatory response, also shows an connection with the astrocyte activation. Recently, it was reported that Src-Suppressed-C Kinase Substrate (SSeCKS) was detected in heat shock protein A12B (HSPA12B) interacting proteins using a yeast 2-hybrid system. SSeCKS, a major Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response protein, has been involved in regulating astrocyte activation via production of proinflammatory factor in CNS inflammation. In this study, we found HSPA12B might regulate the expression and activity of SSeCKS to promote astrocyte inflammatory activation and release of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-1β in spinal cord primary astroglial cultures exposed to LPS treatment. The promoting mechanism of interaction between HSPA12B and SSeCKS on LPS-induced astrocyte activation was mediated via the activation of JNK and p38 signaling pathways but not ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. HSPA12B binded to SSeCKS via its both N terminus consisted of amino acids 1-330 and C terminus consisted of amino acids 1278-1596. And, in vivo, we confirmed the interaction between HSPA12B and SSeCKS of astrocyte activation in the pathogenesis of EAE. The regulatory mechanisms of HSPA12B–SSeCKS interaction may possibly be the key therapeutic strategy of neuroinflammatory disease.

Abstract: The Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET) has been recognized as a crucial step for successful reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Thus, it has been demonstrated, that the efficiency of reprogramming can be enhanced by promoting an epithelial expression program in cells, with a concomitant repression of key mesenchymal genes. However, a detailed characterization of the epithelial transition associated with the acquisition of a pluripotent phenotype is still lacking to this date. Here, we integrate a panel of morphological approaches with gene expression analyses to visualize the dynamics of episomal reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPSCs. We provide the first ultrastructural analysis of human fibroblasts at various stages of episomal iPSC reprogramming, as well as the first real-time live cell visualization of a MET occurring during reprogramming. The results indicate that the MET manifests itself approximately 6–12days after electroporation, in synchrony with the upregulation of early pluripotency markers, and resembles a reversal of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) which takes place during mammalian gastrulation.

Abstract: Tooth movement is the result of periodontal tissue reconstruction. The biomechanical effects produced by orthopedic forces can affect the cytoskeletal rearrangement of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). However, the mechanisms responsible for the cytoskeletal rearrangement are not completely understood. To analyze the effect, we investigated the role of the Rho-mDia1 signaling pathway in cyclic strain-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement of hPDLCs in detail. We cultured hPDLCs on collagen I-coated six-well Bioflex plates and then exposed them to cyclic strain with physiological loading (10%) at a frequency of 0.1Hz for 6 or 24h using a Flexercell Tension Plus system. Notably, the cells cultured on the Bioflex plates showed increased expression levels of RhoA-GTP, profilin-1 protein, and the combination of RhoA and mDia1, whereas the expression levels of Rho-GDIa were reduced compared with a static control group. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal rearrangement of cells was enhanced. However, profilin-1 protein expression and cytoskeletal reorganization under cyclic strain can decrease due to the overexpression of Rho-GDIa or mDia1-siRNA transfection, whereas Rho-GDIa siRNA transfection has the opposite effect on hPDLCs. Together, our results demonstrate that the Rho-mDia1 signaling pathway is involved in the cytoskeletal rearrangement of hPDLCs induced by cyclic strain. These observations may enable a more in-depth understanding of orthodontic tooth movement and the reconstruction of PDL and alveolar bone.

Abstract: The voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav) β1a subunit (Cavβ1a) plays an important role in excitation–contraction coupling (ECC), a process in the myoplasm that leads to muscle-force generation. Recently, we discovered that the Cavβ1a subunit travels to the nucleus of skeletal muscle cells where it helps to regulate gene transcription. To determine how it travels to the nucleus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of the mouse fast skeletal muscle cDNA library and identified an interaction with troponin T3 (TnT3), which we subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays in mouse skeletal muscle in vivo and in cultured C2C12 muscle cells. Interacting domains were mapped to the leucine zipper domain in TnT3 COOH-terminus (160–244 aa) and Cavβ1a NH2-terminus (1–99 aa), respectively. The double fluorescence assay in C2C12 cells co-expressing TnT3/DsRed and Cavβ1a/YFP shows that TnT3 facilitates Cavβ1a nuclear recruitment, suggesting that the two proteins play a heretofore unknown role during early muscle differentiation in addition to their classical role in ECC regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Measuring three-dimensional (3D) localization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow microenvironment using intravital microscopy is a rapidly expanding research theme. This approach holds the key to understanding the detail of HSC-niche interactions, which are critical for appropriate stem cell function. Due to the complex tissue architecture of the bone marrow and to the progressive introduction of scattering and signal loss at increasing imaging depths, there is no ready-made software to handle efficient segmentation and unbiased analysis of the data. To address this, we developed an automated image analysis tool that simplifies and standardizes the biological interpretation of 3D HSC microenvironment images. The algorithm identifies HSCs and measures their localization relative to surrounding osteoblast cells and bone collagen. We demonstrate here the effectiveness, consistency, and accuracy of the proposed approach compared to current manual analysis and its wider applicability to analyze other 3D bone marrow components.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with the opportunistic enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile is an increasingly common clinical complication that follows antibiotic treatment-induced gut microbiota perturbation. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are early responders to enteric pathogens; however, their role during C. difficile infection is undefined. To identify immune pathways that mediate recovery from C. difficile infection, we challenged C57BL/6, Rag1−/− (which lack T and B cells), and Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− (Ragγc−/−) mice (which additionally lack ILCs) with C. difficile. In contrast to Rag1−/− mice, ILC-deficient Ragγc−/− mice rapidly succumbed to infection. Rag1−/− but not Ragγc−/− mice upregulate expression of ILC1- or ILC3-associated proteins following C. difficile infection. Protection against infection was restored by transferring ILCs into Ragγc−/− mice. While ILC3s made a minor contribution to resistance, loss of IFN-γ or T-bet-expressing ILC1s in Rag1−/− mice increased susceptibility to C. difficile. These data demonstrate a critical role for ILC1s in defense against C. difficile.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic detection of microbial products is essential for the initiation of an innate immune response against intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). During Mtb infection of macrophages, activation of cytosolic surveillance pathways is dependent on the mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system and leads to type I interferon (IFN) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production. Whereas the inflammasome regulates IL-1β secretion, the receptor(s) responsible for the activation of type I IFNs has remained elusive. We demonstrate that the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is essential for initiating an IFN response to Mtb infection. cGAS associates with Mtb DNA in the cytosol to stimulate cyclic GAMP (cGAMP) synthesis. Notably, activation of cGAS-dependent cytosolic host responses can be uncoupled from inflammasome activation by modulating the secretion of ESX-1 substrates. Our findings identify cGAS as an innate sensor of Mtb and provide insight into how ESX-1 controls the activation of specific intracellular recognition pathways.

Abstract: Packed red blood cells (PRBC) are used for blood transfusion. PRBC were stored for 30 days under 4°С in hermetic blood bags with CPD anticoagulant-preservative solution. Hematocrit was 50–55%. The distortions of PRBC membranes nanostructure and cells morphology during storage were studied by atomic force microscopy. Basic measurements were performed at the day 2, 6, 9, 16, 23 and 30 of storage and additionally 2–3 days after it. Topological defects occurred on RBC membranes by day 9. They appeared as domains with grain-like structures (“grains”) sized up to 200nm. These domains were appeared in almost all cells. Later these domains merged and formed large defects on cells. It was the formation of domains with the “grains” which was onset process leading eventually to destruction of PRBC. Possible mechanisms of transformation of PRBC and their membrane are related to the alterations of spectrin cytoskeleton. During this storage period potassium ions and lactat concentrations increased, pH decreased, intracellular concentration of reduced glutathione diminished in the preservative solution. Changes of PRBC morphology were detected within the entire period of PRBC storage. Discocytes predominated at the days 1 and 2. By day 30 PRBC transformed into irreversible echinocytes and spheroechinocytes. Study of defects of membranes nanostructure may form the basis of assessing the quality of the stored PRBC. This method may allow to work out the best recommendations for blood transfusion.

Abstract: Generating engraftable hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is an ideal approach for obtaining induced HSCs for cell therapy. However, the path from PSCs to robustly induced HSCs (iHSCs) in vitro remains elusive. We hypothesize that the modification of hematopoietic niche cells by transcription factors facilitates the derivation of induced HSCs from PSCs. The Lhx2 transcription factor is expressed in fetal liver stromal cells but not in fetal blood cells. Knocking out Lhx2 leads to a fetal hematopoietic defect in a cell non-autonomous role. In this study, we demonstrate that the ectopic expression of Lhx2 in OP9 cells (OP9-Lhx2) accelerates the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. OP9-Lhx2 significantly increased the yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells via co-culture with PSCs in vitro. Interestingly, the co-injection of OP9-Lhx2 and PSCs into immune deficient mice also increased the proportion of hematopoietic progenitors via the formation of teratomas. The transplantation of phenotypic HSCs from OP9-Lhx2 teratomas but not from the OP9 control supported a transient repopulating capability. The upregulation of Apln gene by Lhx2 is correlated to the hematopoietic commitment property of OP9-Lhx2. Furthermore, the enforced expression of Apln in OP9 cells significantly increased the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. These results indicate that OP9-Lhx2 is a good cell line for regeneration of hematopoietic progenitors both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Communications between satellite glial cells and neighboring neurons within sensory ganglia may contribute to neuropathic and inflammatory pain. To elucidate the role of satellite glial cells in chemotherapy-induced pain, we examined the effects of oxaliplatin on the gap junction-mediated coupling between these cells. We also examined whether the gap junction blocker, carbenoxolone, can reverse the coupling. Primary cultures of mice trigeminal ganglia, 24–48h after cell isolation, were used. Satellite glial cells were injected with Lucifer yellow in the presence or absence of oxaliplatin (60μM). In addition, the effect of carbenoxolone (100μM) on coupling, and the expression of connexin 43 proteins were evaluated. Dye coupling between adjacent satellite glial cells was significantly increased (2.3-fold, P<0.05) following a 2h incubation with oxaliplatin. Adding carbenoxolone to the oxaliplatin-treated cultures reversed oxaliplatin-evoked coupling to baseline (P<0.05). Immunostaining showed no difference between expression of connexin 43 in control and oxaliplatin-treated cultures. Our findings indicated that oxaliplatin-increased gap junction-mediated coupling between satellite glial cells in primary cultures of mouse trigeminal ganglia, and carbenoxolone reversed this effect. Hence, it is proposed that increased gap junction-mediated coupling was seen between satellite glial cells in TG. This observation together with our previous data obtained from a behavioral study suggests that this phenomenon might contribute to chemotherapy-induced nociception following oxaliplatin treatment.

Abstract: Tumor microenvironment influences targeted drug therapy. In this study we compared drug responses to RAF and MEK inhibitors on tumor cell migration in 2D and 3D culture of BRAFV600E mutant cell lines derived from human papillary (BCPAP) and anaplastic (SW1736) thyroid carcinomas. Scratch wounding was compared to a double-layered collagen gel model developed for analysis of directed tumor cell invasion during prolonged culture. In BCPAP both PLX4720 and U0126 inhibited growth and migration in 2D and decreased tumor cell survival in 3D. In SW1736 drugs had no effect on migration in 2D but decreased invasion in 3D, however this related to reduced growth. Dual inhibition of BRAFV600E and MEK reduced but did not prevent SW1736 invasion although rebound phosphorylation of ERK in response to PLX4720 was blocked by U0126. These findings indicate that anti-tumor drug effects in vitro differ depending on culture conditions (2D vs. 3D) and that the invasive features of anaplastic thyroid cancer depend on non-MEK mechanism(s).

Abstract: Cigarette smoking plays an important role in increased incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The underlying mechanism in which cigarette smoking induced impairment of lung epithelial cells is still unknown. SIRT5 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylase, which has been implicated in the regulation of metabolism, stress responses, and aging. Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) belongs to the O subclass of the forkhead family of transcription factors. It is also involved in protection from oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidants in epithelial cells. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induces SIRT5 to deacetylate FOXO3 at K271 and K290. Deacetylation of FOXO3 promotes its nuclear localization. Notably, transfection with FOXO3 K271R- or K290R-attenuated CSE-induced apoptosis in SIRT5 knocked down cells, suggesting the protective effects of SIRT5, is mediated by FOXO3. In contrast, CSE stress upregulates SIRT5, which activates FOXO3α leading to rescuing apoptosis. Thus, SIRT5 constitutes a determinant of apoptosis by CSE in lung epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Functional analysis of essential genes in the malarial parasite, Plasmodium, is hindered by lack of efficient strategies for conditional protein regulation. We report the development of a rapid, specific, and inducible chemical-genetic tool in the rodent malaria parasite, P. berghei, in which endogenous proteins engineered to contain the auxin-inducible degron (AID) are selectively degraded upon adding auxin. Application of AID to the calcium-regulated protein phosphatase, calcineurin, revealed functions in host and vector stages of parasite development. Whereas depletion of calcineurin in late-stage schizonts demonstrated its critical role in erythrocyte attachment and invasion in vivo, stage-specific depletion uncovered roles in gamete development, fertilization, and ookinete-to-oocyst and sporozoite-to-liver stage transitions. Furthermore, AID technology facilitated concurrent generation and phenotyping of transgenic lines, allowing multiple lines to be assessed simultaneously with significant reductions in animal use. This study highlights the broad applicability of AID for functional analysis of proteins across the Plasmodium life cycle.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is a severe limitation to glioblastoma (GBM) therapy and there is a strong need to understand the underlying mechanisms that determine its response to different chemotherapeutics. Therefore, we induced resistance in C6 rat glioma cell line, which considerably resembles the characteristics of human GBM. The resistant phenotype was developed by 3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), one of the most commonly used therapeutic drug in the course of GBM treatment. After confirmation of the cross-resistance to cisplatin (CPt) and temozolomide (TMZ) in newly established RC6 cell line, we examined cell death induction and DNA damage by these drugs. Resistance to apoptosis and deficiency in forming DNA double-strand breaks was followed by significant decrease in the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. The development of drug resistance was associated with significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease in oxidized to reduced gluthatione ratio in RC6 cell line indicating a reduced level of oxidative stress. The mRNA expression levels of manganese superoxid dismutase (MnSOD), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and gluthatione peroxidase (GPx) were increased while hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) was decreased in RC6 compared to C6 cells. This was in line with obtained changes in ROS content and increased antioxidative capacity of RC6 cells. Importantly, RC6 cells demonstrated collateral sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX). The analysis of this phenomenon revealed increased accumulation of DOX in RC6 cells due to their adaptation to high ROS content and acidification of cytoplasm. In conclusion, newly established RC6 rat glioma cell line could be used as a starting material for the development of allogenic animal model and preclinical evaluation of new antiglioma agents. Collateral sensitivity to DOX obtained after BCNU treatment may prompt new studies aimed to find efficient delivery of DOX to the glioma site in brain.

Abstract: Summary
It has been shown that the mammary luminal lineage could be maintained by luminal stem cells or long-lived progenitors, but their identity and role in breast cancer remain largely elusive. By lineage analysis using Wap-Cre mice, we found that, in nulliparous females, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) genetically marked by Wap-Cre represented a subpopulation of CD61+ luminal progenitors independent of ovarian hormones for their maintenance. Using a pulse-chase lineage-tracing approach based on Wap-Cre adenovirus (Ad-Wap-Cre), we found that Ad-Wap-Cre-marked nulliparous MECs were enriched with CD61+ alveolar progenitors (APs) that gave rise to CD61− alveolar luminal cells during pregnancy/lactation and could maintain themselves long term. When transformed by different oncogenes, they could serve as cells of origin of heterogeneous mammary tumors. Thus, our study revealed a type of long-lived AP within the luminal lineage that may serve as the cellular origin of multiple breast cancer subtypes.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are non-immunogenic, multipotent cells with at least trilineage differentiation potential. They promote wound healing, improve regeneration of injured tissue, and mediate numerous other health effects. MSCs migrate to sites of injury and stimulate repair either through direct differentiation or indirectly through the stimulation of endogenous repair mechanisms. Using the in vitro scratch assay, we show that the inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors TNF-α, SDF-1, PDGF, and bFGF enhance migration of rat MSCs under normoxic conditions, while TNF-α, IFN-γ, PDGF, and bFGF promote MSC migration under hypoxic conditions. This indicates that the oxygen concentration affects how MSCs will migrate in response to specific factors and, consistent with this, differential expression of cytokines was observed under hypoxic versus normoxic conditions. Using the transwell migration assay, we find that TNF-α, IFN-γ, bFGF, IGF-1, PDGF, and SDF-1 significantly increase transmigration of rat MSCs compared to unstimulated medium. MSCs derived from aged rats exhibited comparable migration to MSCs derived from young rats under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, even after application with specific factors. Similarly, migration in MSCs from aged, human donors did not statistically differ compared to migration in MSCs derived from human umbilical cord tissue or younger donors.

Abstract: Nucleolus-like bodies (NLBs) of fully-grown (germinal vesicle, GV) mammalian oocytes are traditionally considered as morphologically distinct entities, which, unlike normal nucleoli, contain transcribed ribosomal genes (rDNA) solely at their surface. In the current study, we for the first time showed that active ribosomal genes are present not only on the surface but also inside NLBs of the NSN-type oocytes. The “internal” rRNA synthesis was evidenced by cytoplasmic microinjections of BrUTP as precursor and by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe to the short-lived 5′ETS segment of the 47S pre-rRNA. We further showed that in the NLB mass of NSN-oocytes, distribution of active rDNA, RNA polymerase I (UBF) and rRNA processing (fibrillarin) protein factors, U3 snoRNA, pre-rRNAs and 18S/28S rRNAs is remarkably similar to that in somatic nucleoli capable to make pre-ribosomes. Overall, these observations support the occurrence of rDNA transcription, rRNA processing and pre-ribosome assembly in the NSN-type NLBs and so that their functional similarity to normal nucleoli. Unlike the NSN-type NLBs, the NLBs of more mature SN-oocytes do not contain transcribed rRNA genes, U3 snoRNA, pre-rRNAs, 18S and 28S rRNAs. These results favor the idea that in a process of transformation of NSN-oocytes to SN-oocytes, NLBs cease to produce pre-ribosomes and, moreover, lose their rRNAs. We also concluded that a denaturing fixative 70% ethanol used in the study to fix oocytes could be more appropriate for light microscopy analysis of nucleolar RNAs and proteins in mammalian fully-grown oocytes than a commonly used cross-linking aldehyde fixative, formalin.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a widely distributed second messenger that appears to be essential in multiple bacterial species, including the Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, the only L. monocytogenes diadenylate cyclase gene, dacA, was deleted using a Cre-lox system activated during infection of cultured macrophages. All ΔdacA strains recovered from infected cells harbored one or more suppressor mutations that allowed growth in the absence of c-di-AMP. Suppressor mutations in the synthase domain of the bi-functional (p)ppGpp synthase/hydrolase led to reduced (p)ppGpp levels. A genetic assay confirmed that dacA was essential in wild-type but not strains lacking all three (p)ppGpp synthases. Further genetic analysis suggested that c-di-AMP was essential because accumulated (p)ppGpp altered GTP concentrations, thereby inactivating the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator CodY. We propose that c-di-AMP is conditionally essential for metabolic changes that occur in growth in rich medium and host cells but not minimal medium.

Abstract: Summary
Temporal profiles of miRNA activity during productive virus infection can provide fundamental insights into host-virus interactions. Most reported miRNA targetome analyses in the context of virus infection have been performed in latently infected cells and lack reliable models for quantifying the suppression efficacy at specific miRNA target sites. Here, we identified highly competent temporal miRNA targetomes during lytic HCMV infection by using AGO-CLIP-seq together with a bioinformatic method that quantifies miRNA functionality at a specific target site, called ACE-scoring. The repression efficiency at target sites correlates with the magnitude of the ACE-score, and temporal HCMV-encoded miRNA targetomes identified by ACE-scoring were significantly enriched in functional categories involved in pathways central for HCMV biology. Furthermore, comparative analysis between human and viral miRNA targetomes supports the existence of intimate cooperation and co-targeting between them. Our holistic survey provides a valuable resource for understanding host-virus interactions during lytic HCMV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Pro-fibrotic microenvironments of scars and tumors characterized by increased stiffness stimulate mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). We investigated whether incorporation of α-SMA into contractile stress fibers regulates human MSC fate. Sorted α-SMA-positive MSCs exhibited high contractile activity, low clonogenicity, and differentiation potential limited to osteogenesis. Knockdown of α-SMA was sufficient to restore clonogenicity and adipogenesis in MSCs. Conversely, α-SMA overexpression induced YAP translocation to the nucleus and reduced the high clonogenicity and adipogenic potential of α-SMA-negative MSCs. Inhibition of YAP rescued the decreased adipogenic differentiation potential induced by α-SMA, establishing a mechanistic link between matrix stiffness, α-SMA, YAP, and MSC differentiation. Consistent with in vitro findings, nuclear localization of YAP was positively correlated in α-SMA expressing stromal cells of adiposarcoma and osteosarcoma. We propose that α-SMA mediated contraction plays a critical role in mechanically regulating MSC fate by controlling YAP/TAZ activation.

Abstract: Summary
Transmissible stages of Toxoplasma gondii store energy in the form of the carbohydrate amylopectin. Here, we show that the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase CDPK2 is a critical regulator of amylopectin metabolism. Increased synthesis and loss of degradation of amylopectin in CDPK2 deficient parasites results in the hyperaccumulation of this sugar polymer. A carbohydrate-binding module 20 (CBM20) targets CDPK2 to amylopectin stores, while the EF-hands regulate CDPK2 kinase activity in response to Ca2+ to modulate amylopectin levels. We identify enzymes involved in amylopectin turnover whose phosphorylation is dependent on CDPK2 activity. Strikingly, accumulation of massive amylopectin granules in CDPK2-deficient bradyzoite stages leads to gross morphological defects and complete ablation of cyst formation in a mouse model. Together these data show that Ca2+ signaling regulates carbohydrate metabolism in Toxoplasma and that the post-translational control of this pathway is required for normal cyst development.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer is fueled by deregulation of signaling pathways in control of cellular growth and proliferation. These pathways are also targeted by infectious pathogens en route to establishing infection. Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is frequent in the Indian subcontinent, with chronic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi infection reported as a significant risk factor. However, direct association and causal mechanisms between Salmonella Typhi infection and GBC have not been established. Deconstructing the epidemiological association between GBC and Salmonella Typhi infection, we show that Salmonella enterica induces malignant transformation in predisposed mice, murine gallbladder organoids, and fibroblasts, with TP53 mutations and c-MYC amplification. Mechanistically, activation of MAPK and AKT pathways, mediated by Salmonella enterica effectors secreted during infection, is critical to both ignite and sustain transformation, consistent with observations in GBC patients from India. Collectively, our findings indicate that Salmonella enterica can promote transformation of genetically predisposed cells and is a causative agent of GBC.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can be cultured for multiplication and maintained for long periods while preserving their spermatogenic ability. Although the cultured SSCs, named germline stem (GS) cells, are targets of genome modification, this process remains technically difficult. In the present study, we tested TALEN and double-nicking CRISPR/Cas9 on GS cells, targeting Rosa26 and Stra8 loci as representative genes dispensable and indispensable in spermatogenesis, respectively. Harvested GS cell colonies showed a high targeting efficiency with both TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9. The Rosa26-targeted GS cells differentiated into fertility-competent sperm following transplantation. On the other hand, Stra8-targeted GS cells showed defective spermatogenesis following transplantation, confirming its prime role in the initiation of meiosis. TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9, when applied in GS cells, will be valuable tools in the study of spermatogenesis and for revealing the genetic mechanism of spermatogenic failure.

Abstract: Sorting of native (unpermeabilized) SVF-cells from human subcutaneous (s)WAT for cell surface staining (cs) of DLK1 and CD34 identified three main populations: ~10% stained cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34−, ~20% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34+dim and ~45% cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+. FACS analysis after permeabilization showed that all these cells stained positive for intracellular DLK1, while CD34 was undetectable in cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34− cells. Permeabilized cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+ cells were positive for the pericyte marker α-SMA and the mesenchymal markers CD90 and CD105, albeit CD105 staining was dim (cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+/CD90+/CD105+dim/α-SMA+/CD45−/CD31−). Only these cells showed proliferative and adipogenic capacity. Cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34− and cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34+dim cells were also α-SMA+ but expressed CD31, had a mixed hematopoietic and mesenchymal phenotype, and could neither proliferate nor differentiate into adipocytes. Histological analysis of sWAT detected DLK1+/CD34+ and DLK1+/CD90+ cells mainly in the outer ring of vessel-associated stroma and at capillaries. DLK1+/α-SMA+ cells were localized in the CD34− perivascular ring and in adventitial vascular stroma. All these DLK1+ cells possess a spindle-shaped morphology with extremely long processes. DLK1+/CD34+ cells were also detected in vessel endothelium. Additionally, we show that sWAT contains significantly more DLK1+ cells than visceral (v)WAT. We conclude that sWAT has more DKL1+ cells than vWAT and contains different DLK1/CD34 populations, and only cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+/CD90+/CD105+dim/α-SMA+/CD45−/CD31− cells in the adventitial vascular stroma exhibit proliferative and adipogenic capacity.

Abstract: Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, requires p39 for its enzymatic activity, and is implicated in cytoskeletal organization and contraction in numerous cell types. The C-terminus of p39 binds muskelin, a multi-domain scaffolding protein known to affect cytoskeletal organization, but the mechanisms by which muskelin affects cytoskeletal organization remain unclear. The present study sought to determine whether p39 might serve as an adaptor protein that links muskelin to stress fibers and to investigate the possible biological relevance of such an interaction. Double immunoprecipitation showed that muskelin, p39, and myosin II are components of a single intracellular complex, and suppressing p39 abrogated the interaction between muskelin and the myosin subunits, demonstrating that p39 is required to link muskelin to myosin II. Muskelin is colocalized with myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) and on stress fibers. The suppression of muskelin reduced Rho-GTP, MRLC phosphorylation, disrupted stress fiber organization, and promoted cell migration, all of which closely mimic the effect of Cdk5 inhibition. Moreover, suppressing muskelin and inhibiting Cdk5 together have no additional effect, indicating that muskelin plays an important role in Cdk5-dependent signaling. p39 is necessary and sufficient for Cdk5-dependent regulation of MRLC phosphorylation, as suppression of p39, but not p35, reduces MRLC phosphorylation. Together, these results demonstrate that p39 specifically links muskelin to myosin II and consequently, to stress fibers and reveal a novel role for muskelin in regulating myosin phosphorylation and cytoskeletal organization.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative motor neuron (MN) disease. The gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a causative element of familial ALS. Animal ALS models involving SOD1 gene mutations are widely used to study the underlying mechanisms of disease and facilitate drug discovery. Unfortunately, most drug candidates have failed in clinical trials, potentially due to species differences among rodents and humans. It is unclear, however, whether there are different responses to drugs among the causative genes of ALS or their associated mutations. In this study, to evaluate different SOD1 mutations, we generated SOD1-ALS models derived from human embryonic stem cells with identical genetic backgrounds, except for the overexpression of mutant variants of SOD1. The overexpression of mutant SOD1 did not affect pluripotency or MN differentiation. However, mutation-dependent reductions in neurite length were observed in MNs. Moreover, experiments investigating the effects of specific compounds revealed that each ALS model displayed different responses with respect to MN neurite length. These results suggest that SOD1 mutations could be classified based the response of MNs to drug treatment. This classification could be useful for the development of mutant-specific strategies for drug discovery and clinical trials.

Abstract: Cancer stem cell (CSC) or tumor initiating cell (TIC) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. Biophysical forces in tumor microenvironment have an important effect on tumor formation and development. In this study, the potential effect of matrix stiffness on the biological characteristics of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) TICs, especially the enrichment of HNSCC TICs, was investigated under three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions by means of alginate gel (ALG) beads with different matrix stiffnesses. ALG beads with soft (21kPa), moderate (70kPa) and hard (105kPa) stiffness were generated by changing alginate concentration. It was found that significant HNSCC TIC enrichment was achieved in the ALG beads with moderate matrix stiffness (70kPa). The gene expression of stemness markers Oct3/4 and Nanog, TIC markers CD44 and ABCG2 was enhanced in cells under this moderate (70kPa) stiffness. HNSCC TIC proportion was also highly enriched under moderate matrix stiffness, accompanying with higher tumorigenicity, metastatic ability and drug resistance. And it was also found that the possible molecular mechanism underlying the regulated TIC properties by matrix stiffness under 3D culture conditions was significantly different from 2D culture condition. Therefore, the results achieved in this study indicated that 3D biophysical microenvironment had an important effect on TIC characteristics and alginate-based biomimetic scaffolds could be utilized as a proper platform to investigate the interaction between tumor cells and 3D microenvironment.

Kallistatin inhibits TGF-β-induced endothelial–mesenchymal transition by differential regulation of microRNA-21 and eNOS expression,

Abstract: Kallistatin, an endogenous protein, consists of two structural elements: active site and heparin-binding domain. Kallistatin exerts beneficial effects on fibrosis by suppressing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β synthesis in animal models. TGF-β is the most potent inducer of endothelial–mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which contributes to fibrosis and cancer. MicroRNA (miR)-21 is an important player in organ fibrosis and tumor invasion. Here we investigated the potential role of kallistatin in EndMT via modulation of miR-21 in endothelial cells. Human kallistatin treatment blocked TGF-β-induced EndMT, as evidenced by morphological changes as well as increased endothelial and reduced mesenchymal marker expression. Kallistatin also inhibited TGF-β-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and NADPH oxidase expression and activity. Moreover, kallistatin antagonized TGF-β-induced miR-21 and Snail1 synthesis, Akt phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) synthesis and activation. Kallistatin via its heparin-binding site blocked TGF-β-induced miR-21, Snail1 expression, and ROS formation, as wild-type kallistatin, but not heparin-binding site mutant kallistatin, exerted the effect. Conversely, kallistatin through its active site stimulated the synthesis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and forkhead box O1 (FoxO1); however, these effects were blocked by genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This is the first study to demonstrate that kallistatin's heparin-binding site is crucial for preventing TGF-β-induced miR-21 and oxidative stress, while its active site is key for stimulating the expression of antioxidant genes via interaction with an endothelial surface tyrosine kinase. These findings reveal novel mechanisms of kallistatin in protection against fibrosis and cancer by suppressing EndMT.

Abstract: Gap junctions are channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Oncogenes such as the middle Tumor antigen of polyoma virus (mT) are known to suppress gap junctional, intercellular communication (GJIC). mT associates with and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by cSrc family members. Specific mT phosphotyrosines provide docking sites for the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc (mT-tyr250) or the SH2 domain of the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3k, mT-tyr315). Binding results in the activation of their downstream signaling cascades, Ras/Raf/Erk and PI3 kinase/Akt, respectively, both of which are needed for full neoplastic transformation. To examine the effect of mT-initiated pathways upon gap junctional communication, GJIC was quantitated in rat liver epithelial T51B cells expressing mT-mutants, using a novel technique of in situ electroporation. The results demonstrate for the first time that, although even low levels of wild-type mT are sufficient to interrupt gap junctional communication, GJIC suppression still requires an intact tyr-250 site, that is activation of the Ras pathway. In sharp contrast, activation of the PI3k pathway is not required for GJIC suppression, indicating that GJIC suppression is independent of full neoplastic conversion and the concomitant morphological changes. Interestingly, expression of a constitutively active, myristylated form of the catalytic subunit of PI3k, p110, or the constitutively active mutants E545K and H1047R increased GJIC, while pharmacological inhibition of PI3k eliminated communication. Therefore, although PI3k is growth promoting and in an activated form it can act as an oncogene, it actually plays a positive role upon gap junctional, intercellular communication.

Abstract: Summary
NPR1, a master regulator of basal and systemic acquired resistance in plants, confers immunity through a transcriptional cascade, which includes transcription activators (e.g., TGA3) and repressors (e.g., WRKY70), leading to the massive induction of antimicrobial genes. How this single protein orchestrates genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming in response to immune stimulus remains a major question. Paradoxically, while NPR1 is essential for defense gene induction, its turnover appears to be required for this function, suggesting that NPR1 activity and degradation are dynamically regulated. Here we show that sumoylation of NPR1 by SUMO3 activates defense gene expression by switching NPR1’s association with the WRKY transcription repressors to TGA transcription activators. Sumoylation also triggers NPR1 degradation, rendering the immune induction transient. SUMO modification of NPR1 is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser55/Ser59, which keeps NPR1 stable and quiescent. Thus, posttranslational modifications enable dynamic but tight and precise control of plant immune responses.

Abstract: In Leishmania donovani, the HSP90 chaperone complex plays an essential role in the control of the parasite’s life cycle, general viability and infectivity. Several of the associated co-chaperones were also shown to be essential for viability and/or infectivity to mammalian cells. Here, we identify and describe the co-chaperone P23 and distinguish its function from that of the structurally related small heat shock protein HSP23. P23 is expressed constitutively and associates itself with members of the HSP90 complex, i.e. HSP90 and Sti1. Viable P23 gene replacement mutants could be raised and confirmed as null mutants without deleterious effects on viability under a variety of physiological growth conditions. The null mutant also displays near-wild-type infectivity, arguing against a decisive role played by P23 in laboratory settings. However, the P23 null mutant displays a marked hypersensitivity against HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. P23 also appears to affect the radicicol resistance of a HSP90 Leu33-Ile mutant described previously. Therefore, the annotation of L. donovani P23 as HSP90-interacting co-chaperone is confirmed.

To assess the potential of PP6 as a therapeutic target in liver disorders, we attenuated expression of the PP6 catalytic subunit in HepG2 cells using lentiviral-transduced shRNA. Two PP6 knock-down (PP6KD) cell lines (90% reduction of PP6-C protein content) were studied in depth. Both proliferated at a rate similar to control cells. However, flow cytometry indicated G2/M cell cycle arrest that was accounted for by a shift of the cells from a diploid to tetraploid state. PP6KD cells did not show an increase in apoptosis, nor did they exhibit reduced viability in the presence of bleomycin or taxol. Gene expression analysis by microarray showed attenuated anti-inflammatory signaling. Genes associated with DNA replication were downregulated. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis yielded 80 phosphopeptides representing 56 proteins that were significantly affected by a stable reduction in PP6-C. Proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA damage repair and pre-mRNA splicing were overrepresented among these. PP6KD cells showed intact mTOR signaling. Our studies demonstrated involvement of PP6 in a diverse set of biological pathways and an adaptive response that may limit the effectiveness of targeting PP6 in liver disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial pathogens express virulence-specific transcriptional programs that allow tissue colonization. Although phenotypic variation has been noted in the context of antibiotic exposure, no direct evidence exists for heterogeneity in virulence-specific transcriptional programs within tissues. In a mouse model of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection, we show that at least three subpopulations of bacteria develop within a single tissue site in response to distinct host signals. Bacteria growing on the exterior of spleen microcolonies responded to soluble signals and induced the nitric oxide (NO)-detoxifying gene, hmp. Hmp effectively eliminated NO diffusion and protected the interior bacterial population from exposure to NO-derived inducing signals. A third subpopulation, constituting the most peripherally localized bacteria, directly contacted neutrophils and transcriptionally upregulated a virulence factor. These studies demonstrate that growth within tissues results in transcriptional specialization within a single focus of microbial replication, facilitating directed pathogen counterattack against the host response.

Abstract: Summary
The derivation of genetically modified induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells typically involves multiple steps, requiring lengthy cell culture periods, drug selection, and several clonal events. We report the generation of gene-targeted iPS cell lines following a single electroporation of patient-specific fibroblasts using episomal-based reprogramming vectors and the Cas9/CRISPR system. Simultaneous reprogramming and gene targeting was tested and achieved in two independent fibroblast lines with targeting efficiencies of up to 8% of the total iPS cell population. We have successfully targeted the DNMT3B and OCT4 genes with a fluorescent reporter and corrected the disease-causing mutation in both patient fibroblast lines: one derived from an adult with retinitis pigmentosa, the other from an infant with severe combined immunodeficiency. This procedure allows the generation of gene-targeted iPS cell lines with only a single clonal event in as little as 2 weeks and without the need for drug selection, thereby facilitating “seamless” single base-pair changes.

Abstract: Summary
Substrate composition significantly impacts human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) self-renewal and differentiation, but relatively little is known about the role of endogenously produced extracellular matrix (ECM) components in regulating hPSC fates. Here we identify α-5 laminin as a signature ECM component endogenously synthesized by undifferentiated hPSCs cultured on defined substrates. Inducible shRNA knockdown and Cas9-mediated disruption of the LAMA5 gene dramatically reduced hPSC self-renewal and increased apoptosis without affecting the expression of pluripotency markers. Increased self-renewal and survival was restored to wild-type levels by culturing the LAMA5-deficient cells on exogenous laminin-521. Furthermore, treatment of LAMA5-deficient cells with blebbistatin or a ROCK inhibitor partially restored self-renewal and diminished apoptosis. These results demonstrate that endogenous α-5 laminin promotes hPSC self-renewal in an autocrine and paracrine manner. This finding has implications for understanding how stem cells dynamically regulate their microenvironment to promote self-renewal and provides guidance for efforts to design substrates for stem cell bioprocessing.

Abstract: The cardiac basement membrane (BM), the highly organized layer of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the external side of the sarcolemma, is mainly composed of laminin and collagen IV, which assemble a dense, well-organized network to surround the surface of each adult cardiomyocyte. The development of the cardiac BM plays a key role in organogenesis of the myocardium through interactions between sarcomeres and integrins. Because of the complicated structure of cardiac muscle fibers and lack of a proper investigation method, the detailed interactions among BM development, sarcomeric growth, and integrin expression remain unclear. In this study, freshly isolated 3-day neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) were cultured on aligned collagen, which mimics the in vivo ECM structure and induces neonatal CMs to grow into rod-like shapes. Then double fluorescence-immunostained laminin and α-actinin or integrin β1 on neonatal CMs cultured 4–72h were imaged using a confocal microscope, and the spatial relationship between laminin deposition and α-actinin expression was evaluated by colocalization analysis. At 4h, laminin was deposited around Z-bodies (dot-shaped α-actinin) and integrins; from 18-to-72h, its gradual colocalization with Z-lines (line-shaped α-actinin) and integrins increased Pearson׳s coefficient; this indicates that development of the BM network from the neonatal stage to adulthood is closely related to sarcomeric formation via integrin-mediated interactions.

Abstract: The development of the efficient screening system of detecting compounds that promote myogenesis and prevent muscle atrophy is important. Mouse C2C12 cells are widely used to evaluate myogenesis but the procedures of the assay are not simple and the quantification is not easy. We established C2C12 cells expressing the N-terminal green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the C-terminal GFP (GFP1–10 and GFP11 cells). GFP1–10 and GFP11 cells do not exhibit GFP signals until they are fused. The signal intensity correlates with the expression of myogenic markers and myofusion. Myogenesis-promoting reagents, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and β-guanidinopropionic acid (GPA), enhance the signals, whereas the poly-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-FMK, suppresses it. GFP signals are observed when myotubes formed by GFP1–10 cells are fused with single nuclear GFP11 cells, and enhanced by IGF1, GPA, and IBS008738, a recently-reported myogenesis-promoting reagent. Fusion between myotubes formed by GFP1–10 and GFP11 cells is associated with the appearance of GFP signals. IGF1 and GPA augment these signals, whereas NSC23766, Rac inhibitor, decreases them. The conditioned medium of cancer cells suppresses GFP signals during myogenesis and reduces the width of GFP-positive myotubes after differentiation. Thus the novel split GFP-based assay will provide the useful method for the study of myogenesis, myofusion, and atrophy.

Abstract: We investigated whether acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protects chicken myocardial cells from heat stress-mediated damage in vivo and whether the induction of Hsp27 expression is connected with this function. Pathological changes, damage-related enzyme levels, and Hsp27 expression were studied in chickens following heat stress (40 ± 1°C for 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, or 24 h, respectively) with or without ASA administration (1 mg/kg BW, 2 h prior). Appearance of pathological lesions such as degenerations and karyopyknosis as well as the myocardial damage-related enzyme activation indicated that heat stress causes considerable injury to the myocardial cells in vivo. Myocardial cell injury was most serious in chickens exposed to heat stress without prior ASA administration; meanwhile, ASA pretreatment acted protective function against high temperature-induced injury. Hsp27 expression was induced under all experimental conditions but was one-fold higher in the ASA-pretreated animals (0.3138±0.0340 ng/mL) than in untreated animals (0.1437±0.0476 ng/mL) 1 h after heat stress exposure, and such an increase was sustained over the length of the experiment. Our findings indicate that pretreatment with ASA protects chicken myocardial cells from acute heat stress in vivo with almost no obvious side effects, and this protection may involve an enhancement of Hsp27 expression. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this effect require further investigation.

Abstract: Pancreatic duct glands (PDGs) have molecular features known to mark stem cell niches, but their function remains to be determined. To investigate the role of PDGs as a progenitor niche, PDGs were analyzed in both humans and mice. Cells were characterized by immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis. In vivo proliferative activity and migration of PDG cells were evaluated using a BrdU tag-and-chase strategy in a mouse model of pancreatitis. In vitro migration assays were used to determine the role of trefoil factor (TFF) -1 and 2 in cell migration. Proliferative activity in the pancreatic epithelium in response to inflammatory injury is identified principally within the PDG compartment. These proliferating cells then migrate out of the PDG compartment to populate the pancreatic duct. Most of the pancreatic epithelial migration occurs within 5days and relies, in part, on TFF-1 and -2. After migration, PDG cells lose their PDG-specific markers and gain a more mature pancreatic ductal phenotype. Expression analysis of the PDG epithelium reveals enrichment of embryonic and stem cell pathways. These results suggest that PDGs are an epithelial progenitor compartment that gives rise to mature differentiated progeny that migrate to the pancreatic duct. Thus PDGs are a progenitor niche important for pancreatic epithelial regeneration.

Abstract: Vision incapacitation and blindness associated with incurable retinal degeneration affect millions of people worldwide. In this study, 0.25×106 human bone marrow stem cells (hBM-MSCs) were transplanted epiretinally in the right eye of Royal College Surgeons (RCS) rats at the age of 28days. Epiretinally transplanted cells were identified as a thin layer of cells along vitreous cavity, in close proximity to the retina or attached to the lens capsule, up to 6weeks following transplantation. Epiretinal transplantation delayed photoreceptor degeneration and rescued retinal function up to 20weeks following cell transplantation. Visual functions remained close to normal levels in epiretinal transplantation rats. No inflammation or any other adverse effects were observed in transplanted eyes. Our findings suggest that transplantation of hBM-MSCs as a thin epiretinal layer is effective for treatment of retinal degeneration in RCS rats, and that transplanting the cells in close proximity to the retina enhances hBM-MSC therapeutic effect compared with intravitreal injection.

Abstract: Nanoparticle (NPs) delivery systems in vivo promises to overcome many obstacles associated with the administration of drugs, vaccines, plasmid DNA and RNA materials, making the study of their cellular uptake a central issue in nanomedicine. The uptake of NPs may be influenced by the cell culture stage and the NPs physical–chemical properties. So far, controversial data on NPs uptake have been derived owing to the heterogeneity of NPs and the general use of immortalized cancer cell lines that often behave differently from each other and from primary mammalian cell cultures. Main aims of the present study were to investigate the uptake, endocytosis pathways, intracellular fate and release of well standardized model particles, i.e. fluorescent 44nm polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs), on two primary mammalian cell cultures, i.e. bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOEC) and human colon fibroblasts (HCF) by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorimetric analysis. Different drugs and conditions that inhibit specific internalization routes were used to understand the mechanisms that mediate PS-NP uptake. Our data showed that PS-NPs are rapidly internalized by both cell types 1) with similar saturation kinetics; 2) through ATP-independent processes, and 3) quickly released in the culture medium. Our results suggest that PS-NPs are able to rapidly cross the cell membrane through passive translocation during both uptake and release, and emphasize the need to carefully design NPs for drug delivery, to ensure their selective uptake and to optimize their retainment in the targeted cells.

Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a crucial transcription factor for neuroprotection in several brain diseases. Using a mouse model of Huntington's Disease (HD), we recently showed that PPARγ not only played a major function in preventing HD, but also oral intake of a PPARγ agonist (thiazolidinedione, TZD) significantly reduced the formation of mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates in the brain (e.g., cortex and striatum). The molecular mechanisms by which PPARγ exerts its HD neuroprotective effects remain unresolved. We investigated whether the PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone) mediates neuroprotection in the mHtt expressing neuroblastoma cell line (N2A). Here we show that rosiglitazone upregulated the endogenous expression of PPARγ, its downstream target genes (including PGC1α, NRF-1 and Tfam) and mitochondrial function in mHtt expressing N2A cells. Rosiglitazone treatment also significantly reduced mHtt aggregates that included ubiquitin (Ub) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), as assessed by a filter-retardation assay, and increased the levels of the functional ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), HSF1 and heat shock protein 27/70 (HSP27/70) in N2A cells. Moreover, rosiglitazone treatment normalized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensors Bip, CHOP and ASK1, and significantly increased N2A cell survival. Taken together, these findings unveil new insights into the mechanisms by which activation of PPARγ signaling protects against the HD-mediated neuronal impairment. Further, our data also support the concept that PPARγ may be a novel therapeutic target for treating HD.

Abstract: Macrophages can be polarised to adopt the M1 or M2 phenotype and functional outcomes of activation include altered secretion of immune molecules such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 as well as upregulation of cell surface molecules specifically associated with each state. Interleukin (IL)-4 mediates its effects through two receptors, the type I and II receptors and activation of these receptors results in phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)6. JAK3 is activated as a consequence of ligation of the type I IL-4R, which participates in Akt activation. We set out to investigate the impact of perturbation of IGF-1 tone on IL-4- and interferon (IFN)γ–induced activation, the mechanisms by which this may occur and the contribution of type I IL-4R activation to adoption of the M2 state. The data presented here indicate that IL-4-induced activation of Akt is JAK3-dependent, enhanced by release of IGF-1 and necessary for full adoption of the M2 phenotype, since blocking IGF-1 activity blunts the ability of IL-4 to induce activation of Akt and to upregulate expression of some M2-associated molecules. In addition, differential control of the expression of mannose receptor (MRC1), arginase-1 (Arg-1), chitinase-3 like 3 (Chi3l3) and found in inflammatory zone 1 (FIZZ1) was observed. The IFNγ-induced decrease in IGF-1 was exacerbated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase, indicating that Akt may regulate its own activation via IGF-1. Overall, a deficit in IGF-1/Akt signalling is associated with decreased capacity to induce the M2 state and an increased responsiveness to IFNγ.

Abstract: Development of novel anti-cancer drug leads that target regulators of protein homeostasis is a formidable task in modern pharmacology. Finding specific inhibitors of human Heat Shock Factor 1 (hHSF1) has proven to be a challenging task, while screening for inhibitors of human Heat Shock Factor 2 (hHSF2) has never been described. We report the development of a novel system based on an in vivo cell growth restoration assay designed to identify specific inhibitors of human HSF2 in a high-throughput format. This system utilizes a humanized yeast strain in which the master regulator of molecular chaperone genes, yeast HSF, has been replaced with hHSF2 with no detrimental effect on cell growth. This replacement preserves the general regulatory patterns of genes encoding major molecular chaperones including Hsp70 and Hsp90. The controlled overexpression of hHSF2 creates a slow-growth phenotype, which is the basis of the growth restoration assay used for high-throughput screening. The phenotype is most robust when cells are cultured at 25 °C, while incubation at temperatures greater than 30°C leads to compensation of the phenotype. Overexpression of hHSF2 causes overexpression of molecular chaperones which is a likely cause of the slowed growth. Our assay is characterized by two unique advantages. First, screening takes place in physiologically relevant, in vivo conditions. Second, hits in our screen will be of medically relevant potency, as compounds that completely inhibit hHSF2 function will further inhibit cell growth and therefore will not be scored as hits. This caveat biases our screening system for compounds capable of restoring hHSF2 activity to a physiologically normal level without completely inhibiting this essential system.

Abstract: Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a pivotal role in the destruction of articular cartilage in patients who are suffering from osteoarthritis (OA). Collagen type II, the basis for articular cartilage, can be degraded by MMP-1, MMP-3, and 13. EGb761, the standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba produced by Dr. Willar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals, has shown its anti-inflammatory capacity. This study aimed to determine a mechanism whereby EGb761 may inhibit cartilage degradation. Our results indicated that pretreatment with EGb761 abolishes MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 gene expression and protein expression induced by TNF-α in human chondrocyte monolayer. In addition, the reduction of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1(TIMP-1) and metalloproteinase-2 gene expression induced by TNF-α was rescued by pretreatment with EGb761. Importantly, TNF-α-induced degradation of collagen type II was ameliorated by EGb761 in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, our results indicated that EGb761 treatment attenuated TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. These actions of EGb761 suggest a mechanism by which EGb761 may act to prevent cartilage breakdown in arthritis.

Osteoprotegerin activates osteosarcoma cells that co-express RANK and RANKL,

Abstract: Background
Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive and often fatal cancer that afflicts over 1000 humans and 10,000 dogs per year in the United States. Recent evidence suggests deregulation in the signaling triad, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), its activating ligand (RANKL), and the RANKL inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of OS. This study investigated the expression of RANK and RANKL in osteosarcoma tumors and cell lines and describes an activating effect of OPG on OS cells in vitro.
Results
Canine OS tumors and cell lines co-express mRNA for both RANK and RANKL. Expression of these proteins in OS cell lines was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Expression of the soluble form of RANKL was not detected in media from OS cells. OPG-Fc incubation increased the phosphorylation status of ERK, AKT and the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and induced NFκB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in canine OS cells. OPG increased proliferation in both canine and human derived OS cell lines.
Conclusion
RANKL is produced by OS tumors and cell lines that also express RANK. This data provides preliminary evidence for a potential autocrine and or paracrine activation pathway in canine OS. An activating effect of exogenous OPG on signal transduction proteins, NFκB and proliferation in OS is described. These data provide new information concerning aberrant signaling in OS and could be important to those considering OPG as a therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
Preservation of cell identity is necessary for homeostasis of most adult tissues. This process is challenged every time a tissue undergoes regeneration after stress or injury. In the lethal Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), skeletal muscle regenerative capacity declines gradually as fibrosis increases. Using genetically engineered tracing mice, we demonstrate that, in dystrophic muscle, specialized cells of muscular, endothelial, and hematopoietic origins gain plasticity toward a fibrogenic fate via a TGFβ-mediated pathway. This results in loss of cellular identity and normal function, with deleterious consequences for regeneration. Furthermore, this fibrogenic process involves acquisition of a mesenchymal progenitor multipotent status, illustrating a link between fibrogenesis and gain of progenitor cell functions. As this plasticity also was observed in DMD patients, we propose that mesenchymal transitions impair regeneration and worsen diseases with a fibrotic component.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory caspases 1 and 11 are activated in response to different agonists and act independently to induce pyroptosis. In the context of IL-1β/IL-18 secretion, however, in vitro studies indicate that caspase-11 acts upstream of NLRP3 and caspase-1. By contrast, studying infection in vivo by the cytosol-invasive bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, we find that caspase-1 activity is required upstream of caspase-11 to control infection. Caspase-1-activated IL-18 induces IFN-γ to prime caspase-11 and rapidly clear B. thailandensis infection. In the absence of IL-18, bacterial burdens persist, eventually triggering other signals that induce IFN-γ. Whereas IFN-γ was essential, endogenous type I interferons were insufficient to prime caspase-11. Although mice transgenic for caspase-4, the human ortholog of caspase-11, cleared B. thailandensis in vivo, they did not strictly require IFN-γ priming. Thus, caspase-1 provides priming signals upstream of caspase-11 but not caspase-4 during murine defense against a cytosol-invasive bacterium.

Abstract: Summary
The host endolysosomal compartment is often manipulated by intracellular bacterial pathogens. Salmonella (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) secrete numerous effector proteins, including SifA, through a specialized type III secretion system to hijack the host endosomal system and generate the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). To form this replicative niche, Salmonella targets the Rab7 GTPase to recruit host membranes through largely unknown mechanisms. We show that Pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1 (PLEKHM1), a lysosomal adaptor, is targeted by Salmonella through direct interaction with SifA. By binding the PLEKHM1 PH2 domain, Salmonella utilize a complex containing PLEKHM1, Rab7, and the HOPS tethering complex to mobilize phagolysosomal membranes to the SCV. Depletion of PLEKHM1 causes a profound defect in SCV morphology with multiple bacteria accumulating in enlarged structures and significantly dampens Salmonella proliferation in multiple cell types and mice. Thus, PLEKHM1 provides a critical interface between pathogenic infection and the host endolysosomal system.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of somatic cells produces induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are invaluable resources for biomedical research. Here, we extended the previous transcriptome studies by performing RNA-seq on cells defined by a combination of multiple cellular surface markers. We found that transcriptome changes during early reprogramming occur independently from the opening of closed chromatin by OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM). Furthermore, our data identify multiple spliced forms of genes uniquely expressed at each progressive stage of reprogramming. In particular, we found a pluripotency-specific spliced form of CCNE1 that is specific to human and significantly enhances reprogramming. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) expression analysis reveals that monoallelic gene expression is induced in the intermediate stages of reprogramming, while biallelic expression is recovered upon completion of reprogramming. Our transcriptome data provide unique opportunities in understanding human iPSC reprogramming.

Abstract: Calreticulin (CRT) is a highly conserved and multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein and plays important roles in salinity stress response. Portunus trituberculatus is a commercially important fishery species, and water salinity conditions influence its commercial farming significantly. In order to research the function of calreticulin under salinity stress, the full-length cDNA sequence of calreticulin from P. trituberculatus (PtCRT) was firstly cloned and characterized. The complete cDNA sequence of PtCRT is 1676 bp with 1218 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a polypeptide of 405 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignments showed that the deduced acid amino sequences of PtCRT shared the highest homology to CRT of Fenneropenaeus chinensis (89 %). Fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that PtCRT was expressed in all detected tissues and showed the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. In addition, salinity challenge significantly influenced the expression level of PtCRT in gill. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in cDNA sequence of PtCRT, and one SNP was associated with the salt tolerant trait. All results indicated that PtCRT plays an important role in mediating the salinity adaption of P. trituberculatus.

Abstract: Previously, we showed that infecting human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) with rotavirus (RV) increases the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with an immunomodulatory function that, upon concentration at 100,000×g, present buoyant densities on a sucrose gradient of between 1.10 to 1.18 g/ml (characteristic of exosomes) and higher than 1.24 g/ml (proposed for apoptotic bodies). The effect of cellular death induced by RV on the composition of these EV is unknown. Here, we evaluated exosome (CD63, Hsc70, and AChE) and apoptotic body (histone H3) markers in EVs isolated by differential centrifugation (4000×g, 10,000×g, and 100,000×g) or filtration/ultracentrifugation (100,000×g) protocols. When we infected cells in the presence of caspase inhibitors, Hsc70 and AChE diminished in EVs obtained at 100,000×g, but not in EVs obtained at 4000×g or 10,000×g. In addition, caspase inhibitors decreased CD63 and AChE in vesicles with low and high buoyant densities. Without caspase inhibitors, RV infection increased exosome markers in all of the EVs obtained by differential centrifugation. However, CD63 preferentially localized in the 100,000×g fraction and H3 only increased in EVs concentrated at 100,000×g and with high buoyant densities on a sucrose gradient. Thus, RV infection increases the release of EVs that, upon concentration at 100,000×g, are composed by exosomes and apoptotic bodies, which can partially be separated using sucrose gradients.

Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) has been associated with expression of ABC transporter genes including P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1, ABCB1). However, deregulation of apoptotic pathways also renders cells resistant to chemotherapy. To discover apoptosis-related genes affected by Pgp expression, we used the HeLa MDR-off system. We found that using doxycycline to control Pgp expression has a significant advantage over tetracycline, in that doxycycline caused less endogenous gene expression modification/perturbation, and was more potent than tetracycline in suppressing Pgp expression. Cells overexpressing Pgp have lower TNFSF10 (TRAIL) expression than their parental cells. Controlled downregulation of Pgp increased endogenous TRAIL protein expression. Also, ectopic overexpression of TRAIL in Pgp-positive cells was associated with a reduction in Pgp levels. However, cells expressing a functionally defective mutant Pgp showed an increase in TRAIL expression, suggesting that Pgp function is required for TRAIL suppression. Cells in which Pgp is knocked down by upregulation of TRAIL expression are less susceptible to TRAIL ligand (sTRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation between functional Pgp and endogenous TRAIL expression. Pgp function plays an important role in the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis pathway by regulating endogenous TRAIL expression and the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis pathway in MDR cancer cells.

Abstract: HCC still has a poor prognosis in clinical due to high recurrence and metastasis rates worldwide nowadays. Indomethacin pretreatment is used as a potential chemopreventive agent in cancers for it could assist in anti-tumor functions of other agents and exert anti-tumor effect. Our study aims to discuss the effects and mechanisms of long-term use of indomethacin in HCC. The HepA mouse models were used to observe tumor recurrence, intrahepatic metastasis and remote metastasis. NK cell, αβ T cell and γδ T cell were used to explore the underlying mechanisms for anti-tumor effect of indomethacin. The results showed that long-term use of indomethacin facilitated intrahepatic recurrence, intrahepatic dissemination and lung metastasis, and indomethacin inhibits TNF-α and IFN-γ in vivo and in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, long-term use of indomethacin increased the expression of PD-1 and PD-L2 in programmed death-1 pathway. Blockade of PD-1 and PD-L2 reversed the reduced production of TNF-α and IFN-γ induced by indomethacin in γδ T cells. In addition, long-term use of indomethacin activates TRIF/NF-κB and JAK/STAT3 pathways, and indomethacin promotes the expression of PD-1 and PD-L2 via TRIF/NF-κB pathway and JAK/STAT3 pathway respectively in γδ T cells. Given these findings, we drew a conclusion that long-term use of indomethacin leads to poor prognoses through promoting the expression of PD-1 and PD-L2 via TRIF/NF-κB pathway and JAK/STAT3 pathway to inhibit TNF-α and IFN-γ in HCC.

Abstract: The niche surrounding stem cells regulate their fate during homeostasis and after injury or infection. The 3D organoid assay has been widely used to study stem cells behavior based on its capacity to evaluate self-renewal, differentiation and the effect of various medium supplements, drugs and co-culture with supportive cells. We established an assay to study both lung and trachea stem cells in vitro. We characterized their proliferation and differentiation spectrum at baseline then evaluated the effect of co-culturing with fibroblasts and endothelial cells and/or treating with several biologically relevant substances as possible contributors to their niche. We found that lung epithelial (but not tracheal basal) stem cells require co-culture with stromal cells to undergo clonal proliferation and differentiation. Fibroblasts were more efficient than endothelial cells in offering this support and the pattern of support varied based on the tissue origin of the stromal cells. Treating distal lung epithelial or basal stem cells with FGF2, FGF9, FGF10, LIF as well as ALK5 and ROCK inhibitors increased their colony formation efficiency and resulted in variable effects on colonies number, size and differentiation spectrum. This model and findings pave the way for better understanding of lung stem cell niche components and factors that can manipulate lung stem cell behavior.

Abstract: We have previously shown that pluripotent stem cells can be induced from adult somatic cells which were exposed to protein extracts isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Interestingly, generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells depended on the background of ES cell lines; possible by extracts from C57, but not from E14. Proteomic analysis of two different mES cell lines (C57 and E14) shows that embryonic Ras (E-Ras) is expressed differently in two mES cell lines; high level of E-Ras only in C57 mESC whose extracts allows iPS cells production from somatic cells. Here, we show that E-Ras augments the efficiency in reprogramming of fibroblast by promoting cell proliferation. We found that over-expression of E-Ras in fibroblast increased cell proliferation which was caused by specific up-regulation of cyclins D and E, not A or B, leading to the accelerated G1 to S phase transition. To figure out the common transcription factor of cyclins D and E, we used TRANSFAC database and selected SP1 as a candidate which was confirmed as enhancer of cyclins D and E by luciferase promoter assay using mutants. As downstream signaling pathways, E-Ras activated only c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) but not ERK or p38. Inhibition of JNK prevented E-Ras-mediated induction of pSP1, cyclins D, E, and cell proliferation. Finally, E-Ras transduction to fibroblast enhanced the efficiency of iPS cell generation by 4 factors (Oct4/Klf4/Sox2/C-myc), which was prevented by JNK inhibitor. In conclusion, E-Ras stimulates JNK, enhances binding of Sp1 on the promoter of cyclins D and E, leading to cell proliferation. E-Ras/JNK axis is a critical mechanism to generate iPS cells by transduction of 4 factors or by treatment of mESC protein extracts.

Abstract: Summary
While neurogenic stem cells have been identified in rodent and human skin, their manipulation and further characterization are hampered by a lack of specific markers. Here, we perform genetic tracing of the progeny of boundary cap (BC) cells, a neural-crest-derived cell population localized at peripheral nerve entry/exit points. We show that BC derivatives migrate along peripheral nerves to reach the skin, where they give rise to terminal glia associated with dermal nerve endings. Dermal BC derivatives also include cells that self-renew in sphere culture and have broad in vitro differentiation potential. Upon transplantation into adult mouse dorsal root ganglia, skin BC derivatives efficiently differentiate into various types of mature sensory neurons. Together, this work establishes the embryonic origin, pathway of migration, and in vivo neurogenic potential of a major component of skin stem-like cells. It provides genetic tools to study and manipulate this population of high interest for medical applications.

Abstract: Summary
The expression of gluconeogenic enzymes is typically repressed when glucose is available. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii utilizes host glucose to sustain high rates of intracellular replication. However, despite their preferential utilization of glucose, intracellular parasites constitutively express two isoforms of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (TgFBP1 and TgFBP2). The rationale for constitutive expression of FBPases in T. gondii remains unclear. We find that conditional knockdown of TgFBP2 results in complete loss of intracellular growth in vitro under glucose-replete conditions and loss of acute virulence in mice. TgFBP2 deficiency was rescued by expression of catalytically active FBPase and was associated with altered glycolytic and mitochondrial TCA cycle fluxes, as well as dysregulation of glycolipid, amylopectin, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Futile cycling between gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes may constitute a regulatory mechanism that allows T. gondii to rapidly adapt to changes in nutrient availability in different host cells.

Abstract: Cancer cells present a particular metabolic behavior. We hypothesized that the progression of bladder cancer could be accompanied by changes in cells glycolytic profile. We studied two human bladder cancer cells, RT4 and TCCSUP, in which the latter represents a more invasive stage. The levels of glucose, pyruvate, alanine and lactate in the extracellular media were measured by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The protein expression levels of glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) and 3 (GLUT3), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. Our data showed that glucose consumption and GLUT3 levels were similar in both cell lines, but TCCSUP cells displayed lower levels of GLUT1 and PFK expression. An increase in pyruvate consumption, concordant with the higher levels of lactate and alanine production, was also detected in TCCSUP cells. Moreover, TCCSUP cells presented lower protein expression levels of GPT and LDH. These results illustrate that bladder cancer progression is associated with alterations in cells glycolytic profile, namely the switch from glucose to pyruvate consumption in the more aggressive stage. This may be useful to develop new therapies and to identify biomarkers for cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
As complete absence of germ cells leads to sterile males in zebrafish, we explored the relationship between primordial germ cell (PGC) number and sexual development. Our results revealed dimorphic proliferation of PGCs in the early zebrafish larvae, marking the beginning of sexual differentiation. We applied morpholino-based gene knockdown and cell transplantation strategies to demonstrate that a threshold number of PGCs is required for the stability of ovarian fate. Using histology and transcriptomic analyses, we determined that zebrafish gonads are in a meiotic ovarian stage at 14 days postfertilization and identified signaling pathways supporting meiotic oocyte differentiation and eventual female fate. The development of PGC-depleted gonads appears to be restrained and delayed, suggesting that PGC number may directly regulate the variability and length of gonadal transformation and testicular differentiation in zebrafish. We propose that gonadal transformation may function as a developmental buffering mechanism to ensure the reproductive outcome.

Abstract: Myosin binding protein H (MyBPH) is a protein of unknown function, which shares sequence and structural similarities with myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC), a protein frequently implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Given the similarity between cMyBPC and MyBPH, we proposed that MyBPH, like cMyBPC, could be involved in HCM pathogenesis and we therefore sought to determine its function. We identified MyBPH-interacting proteins by using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis. The role of MyBPH and cMyBPC in cardiac cell contractility was analysed by measuring the planar cell surface area of differentiated H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes in response to β-adrenergic stress after siRNA knockdown of MyBPH and cMyBPC. Individual knockdown of either protein had no effect on cardiac contractility, while concurrent knockdowns reduced cardiac contractility. These proteins therefore functionally compensate for one another and are critical for cardiac contractility. We further show that both proteins co-localise with the autophagosomal membrane protein LC3, suggesting that both proteins are involved in autophagosomal membrane maturation processes. The results of this study ascribe novel functions to MyBPH, which may contribute to our understanding of its role in the sarcomere. This study provides evidence for a potential role of MyBPH in HCM, which warrants further investigation.

Abstract: miR-498 is a non-coding RNA located intergenically in 19q13.41. Due to its predicted targeting of several genes involved in control of cellular growth, we examined the expression of miR-498 in colon cancer cell lines and a large cohort of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Two colon cancer cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48) and one normal colonic epithelial cell line (FHC) were recruited. The expression of miR-498 was tested in these cell lines by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Tissues from 80 patients with surgical resection of colorectum (60 adenocarcinomas and 20 non-neoplastic tissues) were tested for miR-498 expression by qRT-PCR. In addition, an exogenous miR-498 (mimic) was used to detect the miRNA׳s effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle events in SW480 using MTT calorimetric assay and flow cytometry respectively. The colon cancer cell lines showed reduced expression of miR-498 compared to a normal colonic epithelial cell line. Mimic driven over expression of miR-498 in the SW480 cell line resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased proportions of G2-M phase cells. In tissues, miR-498 expression was too low to be detected in all colorectal adenocarcinoma compared to non-neoplastic tissues. This suggests that the down regulation of miR-498 in colorectal cancer tissues and the direct suppressive cellular effect noted in cancer cell lines implies that miR-498 has some direct or indirect role in the pathogenesis of colorectal adenocarcinomas.

MicroRNA-101 overexpression by IL-6 and TNF-α inhibits cholesterol efflux by suppressing ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression,

Abstract: Background
MicroRNAs play key roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in regulating ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and cholesterol efflux under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions in human THP-1-derived macrophages and HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells.
Methods
The cell lines were transfected with one of four lentiviral vectors: miR-101, miR-101 control, anti-miR-101, or anti-miR-101 control. A luciferase reporter assay was used to examine miR-101 binding to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of ABCA1. Western blotting was conducted to assess ABCA1 protein expression. Cells were loaded with BODIPY-cholesterol and stained with oil red O to assess cholesterol efflux.
Results
The luciferase activity assay revealed that wild-type miR-101 binding at site 2 significantly repressed ABCA1 3’ UTR activity, suggesting that miR-101 directly targets the ABCA1 mRNA at site 2. In both cell lines, Western blotting revealed that miR-101 expression negatively regulates ABCA1 protein expression and significantly suppresses cholesterol efflux to ApoA1 under both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-LDL conditions, which was confirmed by pronounced lipid inclusions visible by oil red O staining. In HepG2 cells, both IL-6 and TNF-α treatments produced significant miR-101 overexpression; however, in THP-1-derived macrophages, only IL-6 treatment produced significant miR-101 overexpression. Anti-mir-101 transfection under both IL-6 and TNF-α treatment conditions led to ABCA1 upregulation, indicating that miR-101 expression represses ABCA1 expression under inflammatory conditions.
Conclusions
miR-101 promotes intracellular cholesterol retention under inflammatory conditions through suppressing ABCA1 expression and suggests that the miR-101-ABCA1 axis may play an intermediary role in the development of NAFLD and vascular atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Brucella, which is regarded as an intracellular pathogen responsible for a zoonotic disease called brucellosis, survives and proliferates within several types of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Brucella infects not only their preferred hosts but also other domestic and wild animal species, inducing abortion and infertility. Therefore, the interaction between uterine cells and Brucella is important for understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. In this study, we describe the Brucella suis vaccine strain S2 (B.suis.S2) infection and replication in the immortalized caprine endometrial epithelial cell line hTERT-EECs and the induced cellular and molecular response modulation in vitro. We found that B.suis S2 was able to infect and replicate to high titers and inhibit the proliferation of EECs and induce non-apoptotic pathways, as determined by B.suis.S2 detection using MTT and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and flow cytometry. We explored the evidence of non-apoptotic pathways using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and by western blot analysis. Finally, we discovered the over-expression of GRP78, ATF4, ATF6, PERK, eIF2α, CHOP, and cytochrome c (Cyt-c) but not IRE1, xbp-1, and caspase-3 in B.suis.S2 (HK)-attacked and B.suis.S2-infected cells, suggesting that the molecular mechanism of ER stress sensor activation by B.suis.S2 is basically concomitant with that by B.suis.S2 (HK) and that ER stress, especially the PERK pathway, plays an important role in the process of B.suis.S2 infecting EEC, which may, in part, explain the role of the uterus in the pathogenesis of B.suis.S2.

Abstract: Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a small molecule that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) to constrain the aerobic glycolytic pathway observed in many cancer cells and effectively kill them with limited cytotoxicity on normal cells. We previously showed that DCA induced a cytoprotective effect in different human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines under anoxic conditions. In this study, we investigated the molecular and metabolic changes that may be providing this cytoprotection. The expression profiles of PDK isoforms in SW480 and LS174T cells along with subsequent changes in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation were assessed following DCA exposure. Changes in mitochondrial activity and subsequent glucose consumption and lactate production were then examined. We show evidence of differential regulation in PDH phosphorylation between different human CRC cells leading to differences in mitochondrial activity following DCA exposure. However, these effects did not lead to significant changes in cellular metabolism nor growth. In conclusion, DCA may only be beneficial in treating a subset of tumor types based on their molecular profiles of different PDK isoforms.

Abstract: Angiotensin (Ang) II, the main effector of the renin–angiotensin system, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Ang-(1–7) binds to the G protein-coupled Mas receptor (MasR) and can exert vasoprotective effects. We investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of Ang-(1–7) on Ang II-induced dysfunction and oxidative stress in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HbmECs). The pro-apoptotic activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) productions in HbmECs were measured. The protein expressions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (Nox2), serine/threonine kinase (Akt), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and their phosphorylated forms (p-Akt and p-eNOS) were examined by western blot. MasR antagonist and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor were used for receptor/pathway verification. We found that Ang-(1–7) suppressed Ang II-induced pro-apoptotic activity, ROS over-production and NO reduction in HbmECs, which were abolished by MasR antagonist. In addition, Ang-(1–7) down-regulated the expression of Nox2, and up-regulated the ratios of p-Akt/Akt and its downstream p-eNOS/eNOS in HbmECs. Exposure to PI3K inhibitor partially abrogated Ang-(1–7)-mediated protective effects in HbmECs. Our data suggests that Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis protects HbmECs from Ang II-induced dysfunction and oxidative stress via inhibition of Nox2/ROS and activation of PI3K/NO pathways.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), consisting of α and β subunits, activate various genes to adapt to low oxygen environments through their heterodimeric complex formation in the nucleus. While most of the studies have been extensively focused on the HIF-1α isoform, the effect of HIF-α isoforms on the complex formation between HIF-2α and HIF-1β in live cells has not been reported in detail. To probe these interactions in a physiological condition, we established a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay by introducing fluorescent reporter proteins onto the N-termini of HIF-2α and HIF-1β in live PC3 cells. After thorough validations of our FRET assay system, we showed that both HIF-1α and HIF-3α variants likely function as negative regulators on the heterodimer formation of HIF-2α with HIF-1β in cells. We also characterized the localization and stabilization of HIF-3α variants and measured the interaction between HIF-3α variants and other HIF isoforms in live cells. In contrast to the previous results showing HIF-3α-mediated blockage of HIF-1α translocation, the presence of HIF-3α did not affect the localization of HIF-2α, suggesting distinct roles of HIF-3α in regulation of two HIF-α isoforms.

Abstract: Due to the limitation of current pharmacological therapeutic strategies, stem cell therapies have emerged as a viable option for treating many incurable neurological disorders. Specifically, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), a multipotent cell population that is capable of near indefinite expansion and subsequent differentiation into the various cell types that comprise the central nervous system (CNS), could provide an unlimited source of cells for such cell-based therapies. However the clinical application of these cells will require (i) defined, xeno-free conditions for their expansion and neuronal differentiation and (ii) scalable culture systems that enable their expansion and neuronal differentiation in numbers sufficient for regenerative medicine and drug screening purposes. Current extracellular matrix protein (ECMP)-based substrates for the culture of hNPCs are expensive, difficult to isolate, subject to batch-to-batch variations, and, therefore, unsuitable for clinical application of hNPCs. Using a high-throughput array-based screening approach, we identified a synthetic polymer, poly(4-vinyl phenol) (P4VP), that supported the long-term proliferation and self-renewal of hNPCs. The hNPCs cultured on P4VP maintained their characteristic morphology, expressed high levels of markers of multipotency, and retained their ability to differentiate into neurons. Such chemically defined substrates will eliminate critical roadblocks for the utilization of hNPCs for human neural regenerative repair, disease modeling, and drug discovery.

Abstract: This study aims to explore the detail molecular mechanism by which artesunate (ARS), an artemisinin derivative, induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells. ARS induced a loss of mitochondrial transmemberane potential (ΔΨm), phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, as well as activations of Bax/Bak and caspases indicative of apoptosis induction. Silencing Bax but not Bak significantly inhibited ARS-induced apoptosis, demonstrating the key role of the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway. Although ARS increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), ARS-induced apoptosis was neither prevented by pretreatment with ROS scavengers nor potentiated by pretreatment with l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) that enhanced the ARS-induced intracellular ROS generation, demonstrating that ROS was not involved in ARS-induced apoptosis. In addition, ARS did not induce Bid translocation to mitochondria, and the cytotoxicity of ARS was not prevented by silencing Bim, Puma or Mcl-1, but was significantly enhanced by HA14-1 pretreatment, demonstrating that Bcl-2/-xl instead of Bid and Bim as well as Puma may be the upstream factor to regulate the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ARS induces ROS-independent apoptosis via the Bax-mediated intrinsic pathway in HepG2 cells.

Abstract: Cancer cell survival is frequently dependent on the elevated levels of members of the Bcl-2 family of prosurvival proteins that bind to and inactivate BH3-domain pro-apoptotic cellular proteins. Small molecules that inhibit the protein–protein interactions between prosurvival and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (so-called “BH3 mimetics”) have a potential therapeutic value, as indicated by clinical findings obtained with ABT-263 (navitoclax), a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist, and more recently with GDC-0199/ABT-199, a more selective antagonist of Bcl-2. Here, we report study results of the functional role of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 against a panel of solid cancer cell lines representative of different tumor types. We observed silencing of Mcl-1 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly reduced viability and induced apoptosis in almost 30% of cell lines tested, including lung and breast adenocarcinoma, as well as glioblastoma derived lines. Most importantly, we provide a mechanistic basis for this sensitivity by showing antagonism of Mcl-1 function with specific BH3 peptides against isolated mitochondria induces Bak oligomerization and cytochrome c release, therefore demonstrating that mitochondria from Mcl-1-sensitive cells depend on Mcl-1 for their integrity and that antagonizing Mcl-1 function is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Thus, our results lend further support for considering Mcl-1 as a therapeutic target in a number of solid cancers and support the rationale for development of small molecule BH3-mimetics antagonists of this protein.

Abstract: Developing platforms that allow tuning cell functionality through incorporating physical, chemical, or mechanical cues onto the material surfaces is one of the key challenges in research in the field of biomaterials. In this respect, various approaches have been proposed and numerous structures have been developed on a variety of materials. Most of these approaches, however, demand a multistep process or post-chemical treatment. Therefore, a simple approach would be desirable to develop bio-functionalized platforms for effectively modulating cell adhesion and consequently programming cell functionality without requiring any chemical or biological surface treatment. This study introduces a versatile yet simple laser approach to structure silicon (Si) chips into cytophobic/cytophilic patterns in order to modulate cell adhesion and proliferation. These patterns are fabricated on platforms through direct laser processing of Si substrates, which renders a desired computer-generated configuration into patterns. We investigate the morphology, chemistry, and wettability of the platform surfaces. Subsequently, we study the functionality of the fabricated platforms on modulating cervical cancer cells (HeLa) behaviour. The results from in vitro studies suggest that the nanostructures efficiently repel HeLa cells and drive them to migrate onto untreated sites. The study of the morphology of the cells reveals that cells evade the cytophobic area by bending and changing direction. Additionally, cell patterning, cell directionality, cell channelling, and cell trapping are achieved by developing different platforms with specific patterns. The flexibility and controllability of this approach to effectively structure Si substrates to cell-repulsive and cell-adhesive patterns offer perceptible outlook for developing bio-functionalized platforms for a variety of biomedical devices. Moreover, this approach could pave the way for developing anti-cancer platforms that selectively repel cancer cells while favoring the adhesion of normal cells.

Abstract: The expression of HSP70 in embryonic cells of mammals and its role for their normal development and protection is an important aspect to be investigated in pregnancy and/or mild diabetes. In this sense, the present study evaluated the effects of mild diabetes on maternal reproductive parameters and HSP70 levels in Wistar rats at different stages of life and in their offspring. Mild diabetes was induced by a beta-cytotoxic drug (streptozotocin) at birth. Four experimental groups were evaluated: at 90 days of age: nonpregnant nondiabetic (ND90) and nonpregnant mild diabetic (D90) female rats, and at term pregnancy: pregnant female rats of both glycemic status were examined (NDP and DP, respectively). The rats were submitted to oral glucose tolerance test, and blood samples were collected for determination of HSP70 levels. In addition, the reproductive performance of pregnant rats was assessed and HSP70 levels determined in their offspring blood samples. The HSP70 levels and maternal reproductive performance presented no difference between ND and D rats, regardless of the life stage. The HSP70 levels were increased in D90 rats and lower in offspring from D rats. Maternal HSP70 levels were positively correlated to the number of dead embryos. In conclusion, mild diabetes did not affect maternal reproductive performance, but high maternal HSP70 levels compromised embryo development. In addition, offspring from D rats exhibited lower HSP70 levels, showing that this protein can be used as an indicator of metabolic consequences of diabetes and predictor of related disorders in adulthood.

Abstract: Cellular levels of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are elevated in multiple human cancers and their activities often play a part in promoting cancer cell survival by blocking apoptotic pathways, controlling signal transduction pathways and contributing to resistance. These proteins function through interactions of their BIR (baculoviral IAP repeat) protein domains with pathway components and these interactions are endogenously antagonized by Smac/Diablo (second mitochondrial activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low isoelectric point). This report describes development of synthetic smac mimetics (SM) and compares their binding, antiproliferative and anti-tumor activities. All dimeric antagonists inhibit in vitro smac tetrapeptide binding to recombinant IAP proteins, rescue IAP-bound caspase-3 activity and show anti-proliferative activity against human A875 melanoma cells. One heterodimeric SM, SM3, binds tightly to IAP proteins in vitro and slowly dissociates (greater than two hours) from these protein complexes compared to the other antagonists. In addition, in vitro SM anti-proliferation potency is influenced by ABCB1 transporter (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B; MDR1, P-gp) activities and one antagonist, SM5, does not appear to be an ABCB1 efflux pump substrate. All dimeric smac mimetics inhibit the growth of human melanoma A875 tumors implanted in athymic mice at well-tolerated doses. One antagonist, SM4, shows broad spectrum in vivo anti-tumor activity and modulates known pharmacodynamic markers of IAP antagonism. These data taken together demonstrate the range of diverse dimeric IAP antagonist activities and supports their potential as anticancer agents.

Abstract: Wnt signaling regulates multiple cellular events such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through β-catenin-dependent canonical and β-catenin-independent noncanonical pathways. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling can promote the differentiation of dental follicle cells, putative progenitor cells for cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and periodontal ligament cells, toward a cementoblast/osteoblast phenotype during root formation, but little is known about the biological significance of noncanonical Wnt signaling in this process. We identified the expression of Wnt5a, a representative noncanonical Wnt ligand, in tooth root lining cells (i.e. precementoblasts/cementoblasts) and dental follicle cells during mouse tooth root development, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Silencing expression of the Wnt5a gene in a dental follicle cell line resulted in enhancement of the Wnt3a (a representative canonical Wnt ligand)-mediated increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant Wnt5a inhibited the increase in ALP expression, suggesting that Wnt5a signaling functions as a negative regulator of canonical Wnt-mediated ALP expression of dental follicle cells. Wnt5a did not affect the nuclear translocation of β-catenin as well as β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation of T-cell factor (Tcf) triggered by Wnt3a, suggesting that Wnt5a inhibits the downstream part of the β-catenin-Tcf pathway. These findings suggest the existence of a feedback mechanism between canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling during the differentiation of dental follicle cells.

Abstract: Summary
The correct ratio of the HIV-1 structural protein Gag to the envelope protein (Env) is important for maximal virion infectivity. How the virus ensures the production of Gag and Env proteins in an appropriate ratio remains unknown. We report that HIV-1 exploits the host factor RuvB-like 2 (RVB2) to balance relative expression of Gag and Env for efficient production of infectious virions. RVB2 inhibits Gag expression by interacting with both the encoded Matrix (MA) domain of Gag protein and 5′ UTR of the translating mRNA and promoting mRNA degradation in a translation-dependent manner. This inhibitory activity of RVB2 is antagonized by Env through competitive interaction with MA, allowing Gag synthesis to proceed when Env levels are adequate for virion assembly. In HIV-1-positive patients, RVB2 levels positively correlate with viral loads and disease progression status. These findings reveal a mechanism by which HIV-1 regulates its protein expression.

Abstract: The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulates numerous cellular processes, including cell proliferation and survival responses. The constitutive activation of NF-κB has also emerged as an important oncogenic driver in many malignancies, such as activated B-cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma, among others. In this study, we investigated the impact and mechanisms of action of Withaferin A, a naturally produced steroidal lactone, against both signal-inducible as well as constitutive NF-κB activities. We found that Withaferin A is a robust inhibitor of canonical and constitutive NF-κB activities, leading to apoptosis of certain lymphoma lines. In the canonical pathway induced by TNF, Withaferin A did not disrupt RIP1 polyubiquitination or NEMO–IKKβ interaction and was a poor direct IKKβ inhibitor, but prevented the formation of TNF-induced NEMO foci which colocalized with TNF ligand. While GFP-NEMO efficiently formed TNF-induced foci, a GFP-NEMOY308S mutant that is defective in binding to polyubiquitin chains did not form foci. Our study reveals that Withaferin A is a novel type of IKK inhibitor which acts by disrupting NEMO reorganization into ubiquitin-based signaling structures in vivo.

Abstract: Bone metastasis is a common burden in many types of cancer and has a severe impact on the quality of life in patients. Hence, specific therapeutic strategies inhibiting tumor induced osteolysis are urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to interfere with integrin adhesion receptors, which are central players of the bone resorption process. For this purpose, we used cilengitide, a cyclic RGD peptide, which blocks integrin αVβ3 and αVβ5-ligand binding. Our results revealed that cilengitide blocked osteoclast maturation in a dose-dependent manner. In detail, pre-osteoclasts treated with cilengitide exhibited reduced cell spreading, cell migration and cell adhesion on RGD-containing matrix proteins, which are ligands of integrin αV. The activation of the most upstream signal transduction molecules of the integrin receptor-initiated pathway, FAK and c-Src, were consistently blocked by cilengitide. First evidence suggests that cilengitide might interfere with metastatic bone disease in vivo and this study describes a potential underlying mechanism of the inhibitory effect of cilengitide on αV-integrin expressing pre-osteoclasts by blocking integrin ligand binding and interfering with osteoclast maturation and cell behavior. In conclusion, our findings suggest that cilengitide, which interferes with αV-integrins on osteoclasts, may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of malignant bone disease.

Abstract: Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by the forced expression of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Pluripotent reprogramming appears as a slow and inefficient process because of genetic and epigenetic barriers of somatic cells. In this report, we have extended previous observations concerning donor age and passage number of human fibroblasts as critical determinants of the efficiency of iPSC induction. Human fibroblasts from 11 different donors of variable age were reprogrammed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors. Although all fibroblasts gave rise to iPSC colonies, the reprogramming efficiency correlated negatively and declined rapidly with increasing donor age. In addition, the late passage fibroblasts gave less reprogrammed colonies than the early passage cell counterparts, a finding associated with the cellular senescence-induced upregulation of p21. Knockdown of p21 restored iPSC generation even in long-term passaged fibroblasts of an old donor, highlighting the central role of the p53/p21 pathway in cellular senescence induced by both donor age and culture time.

Abstract: A consequence of hsp70 (HSPA1A) induction is the inhibition of autophagy. Evidence of autophagy involvement in all aspects of the reproductive process is reviewed, and possible consequences of hsp70 induction at each developmental stage are postulated. It is proposed that aberrant external or internal stimuli that result in high levels of hsp70 production interfere with normal autophagy-related functions and lead to a decrease in the number of functional ova and spermatozoa, impaired pre- and post-implantation embryo development, and increased susceptibility to premature labor and delivery. The purpose of this review is to increase understanding of hsp70-autophagy interactions during reproduction. Interventions to modulate this interaction will lead to development of novel protocols to improve fertility and pregnancy outcome.

cAMP effects have been initially attributed to protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Subsequently, two exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac1/2) have been identified as cAMP targets. Aim of this study was to investigate cAMP effects in pancreatic-NET (P-NET) and bronchial carcinoids and in corresponding cell lines (QGP-1 and H727) on cell proliferation and adhesion and to determine PKA and Epac role in mediating these effects. We found that cAMP increased cyclin D1 expression in P-NET and QGP-1 cells, whereas it had opposite effects on bronchial carcinoids and H727 cells and it promoted cell adhesion in QGP-1 and H727 cells. These effects are mimicked by Epac and PKA specific analogs, activating the small GTPase Rap1. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cAMP exerted divergent effects on proliferation and promoted cell adhesion of different neuroendocrine cell types, these effects being mediated by both Epac and PKA and involving the same effector GTPase Rap1.

Abstract: Several studies in mice indicate a role for apolipoprotein E (APOE) in lipid accumulation and adipogenic differentiation in adipose tissue. However, little is yet known if APOE functions in a similar manner in human adipocytes. This prompted us to compare lipid loading and expression of adipocyte differentiation markers in APOE-deficient and control adipocytes using the differentiated human mesenchymal stem cell line hMSC-Tert as well as primary human and mouse adipocytes as model systems. Differentiated hMSC-Tert were stably transduced with or without siRNA targeting APOE while murine adipocytes were isolated from wild type and Apoe knockout mice. Human APOE knockdown hMSC-Tert adipocytes accumulated markedly less triglycerides compared to control cells. This correlated with strongly decreased gene expression levels of adipocyte markers such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) as well as the key transcription factor driving adipocyte differentiation, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARG), in particular the PPARG2 isoform. Similarly, differentiation of murine Apoe-deficient adipocytes was characterized by reduced gene expression of Adipoq, Fabp4 and Pparg. Interestingly, incubation of APOE-deficient hMSC-Tert adipocytes with conditioned media from APOE3-overexpressing adipocytes or APOE-containing Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) partially restored triglyceride accumulation, but were unable to induce adipocyte differentiation, as judged by expression of adipocyte markers. Taken together, depletion of endogenous APOE in human adipocytes severely impairs lipid accumulation, which is associated with an inability to initiate differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); however, it is unclear whether miRNAs are required for reprogramming and whether miRNA activity as a whole facilitates reprogramming. Here we report on successful reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and neural stem cells (NSCs) lacking Dgcr8, a factor required for the biogenesis of canonical miRNAs, by Yamanaka factors, albeit at decreased efficiencies. Though iPSCs derived from Dgcr8-deficient mouse fibroblasts or NSCs were able to self-renew and expressed pluripotency-associated markers, they exhibited poor differentiation potential into mature somatic tissues, similar to Dgcr8−/− embryonic stem cells. The differentiation defects could be rescued with expression of DGCR8 cDNA. Our data demonstrate that while miRNA activity as a whole facilitates reprogramming, canonical miRNA may be dispensable in the derivation of iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Stem-toxic small molecules have been developed to induce selective cell death of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to lower the risk of teratoma formation. However, despite their high efficacies, chemical-based approaches may carry unexpected toxicities on specific differentiated cell types. Herein, we took advantage of KillerRed (KR) as a suicide gene, to selectively induce phototoxicity using visible light via the production of reactive oxygen species. PSCs in an undifferentiated state that exclusively expressed KR (KR-PSCs) were eliminated by a single exposure to visible light. This highly selective cell death in KR-PSCs was exploited to successfully inhibit teratoma formation. In particular, endothelial cells from KR-mPSCs remained fully functional in vitro and sufficient to repair ischemic injury in vivo regardless of light exposure, suggesting that a genetic approach in which KR is expressed in a tightly controlled manner would be a viable strategy to inhibit teratoma formation for future safe PSC-based therapies.
