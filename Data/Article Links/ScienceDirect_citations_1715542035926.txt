Abstract: Ethanolamine plasmalogens constitute a group of ether glycerophospholipids that, due to their unique biophysical and biochemical properties, are essential components of mammalian cellular membranes. Their importance is emphasized by the consequences of defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis, which in humans cause the fatal disease rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP). In the present lipidomic study, we used fibroblasts derived from RCDP patients, as well as brain tissue from plasmalogen-deficient mice, to examine the compensatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis in response to plasmalogen deficiency. Our results show that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a diacyl glycerophospholipid, which like ethanolamine plasmalogens carries the head group ethanolamine, is the main player in the adaptation to plasmalogen insufficiency. PE levels were tightly adjusted to the amount of ethanolamine plasmalogens so that their combined levels were kept constant. Similarly, the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in ethanolamine phospholipids was maintained upon plasmalogen deficiency. However, we found an increased incorporation of arachidonic acid at the expense of docosahexaenoic acid in the PE fraction of plasmalogen-deficient tissues. These data show that under conditions of reduced plasmalogen levels, the amount of total ethanolamine phospholipids is precisely maintained by a rise in PE. At the same time, a shift in the ratio between ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs occurs, which might have unfavorable, long-term biological consequences. Therefore, our findings are not only of interest for RCDP but may have more widespread implications also for other disease conditions, as for example Alzheimer's disease, that have been associated with a decline in plasmalogens.

Abstract: Although expression of the human liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) T94A variant alters serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels in human subjects, nothing is known whereby the variant elicits these effects. This issue was addressed by in vitro cholesterol binding assays using purified recombinant wild-type (WT) FABP1 T94T and T94A variant proteins and in cultured primary human hepatocytes expressing the FABP1 T94T (genotyped as TT) or T94A (genotyped as CC) proteins. The human FABP1 T94A variant protein had 3-fold higher cholesterol-binding affinity than the WT FABP1 T94T as shown by NBD-cholesterol fluorescence binding assays and by cholesterol isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) binding assays. CC variant hepatocytes also exhibited 30% higher total FABP1 protein. HDL- and LDL-mediated NBD-cholesterol uptake was faster in CC variant than TT WT human hepatocytes. VLDL-mediated uptake of NBD-cholesterol did not differ between CC and TT human hepatocytes. The increased HDL- and LDL-mediated NBD-cholesterol uptake was not associated with any significant change in mRNA levels of SCARB1, LDLR, CETP, and LCAT encoding the key proteins in lipoprotein cholesterol uptake. Thus, the increased HDL- and LDL-mediated NBD-cholesterol uptake by CC hepatocytes may be associated with higher affinity of T94A protein for cholesterol and/or increased total T94A protein level.

Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is effective against glioma cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. In the present study we determined how GLA alone or in combination with irradiation alters the fatty acid (FA) and lipid profiles, the lipid droplet (LD) content, the lipid biosynthetic gene expression and the apoptosis of glioma cells. In GLA-treated cells direct correlations were found between the levels of various FAs and the expression of the corresponding FA biosynthetic genes. The total levels of saturated and monosaturated FAs decreased in concert with the down-regulation of FASN and SCD1 gene expression. Similarly, decreased FADS1 gene expression was paralleled by lowered arachidonic acid (20:4 n−6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n−3) contents, while the down-regulation of FADS2 expression was accompanied by a diminished docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n−3) content. Detailed mass spectrometric analyses revealed that individual treatments gave rise to distinct lipidomic fingerprints. Following uptake, GLA was subjected to elongation, resulting in dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3 n−6, DGLA), which was used for the synthesis of the LD constituent triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters. Accordingly, an increased number of LDs were observed in response to GLA administration after irradiation. GLA increased the radioresponsiveness of U87 MG cells, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells determined by FACS analysis. In conclusion, treatment with GLA increased the apoptosis of irradiated glioma cells, and GLA might therefore increase the therapeutic efficacy of irradiation in the treatment of gliomas.

Abstract: Fatty acid (FA) transport and activation have been extensively studied in the model yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae but have rarely been examined in oleaginous yeasts, such as Yarrowia lipolytica. Because the latter begins to be used in biodiesel production, understanding its FA transport and activation mechanisms is essential. We found that Y. lipolytica has FA transport and activation proteins similar to those of S. cerevisiae (Faa1p, Pxa1p, Pxa2p, Ant1p) but mechanism of FA peroxisomal transport and activation differs greatly with that of S. cerevisiae. While the ScPxa1p/ScPxa2p heterodimer is essential for growth on long-chain FAs, ΔYlpxa1 ΔYlpxa2 is not impaired for growth on FAs. Meanwhile, ScAnt1p and YlAnt1p are both essential for yeast growth on medium-chain FAs, suggesting they function similarly. Interestingly, we found that the ΔYlpxa1 ΔYlpxa2 ΔYlant1 mutant was unable to grow on short-, medium-, or long-chain FAs, suggesting that YlPxa1p, YlPxa2p, and YlAnt1p belong to two different FA degradation pathways. We also found that YlFaa1p is involved in FA storage in lipid bodies and that FA remobilization largely depended on YlFat1p, YlPxa1p and YlPxa2p. This study is the first to comprehensively examine FA intracellular transport and activation in oleaginous yeast.

Fructose supplementation impairs rat liver autophagy through mTORC activation without inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress,

Abstract: Supplementation with 10% liquid fructose to female rats for 2weeks caused hepatic steatosis through increased lipogenesis and reduced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α activity and fatty acid catabolism, together with increased expression of the spliced form of X-binding protein-1 (Rebollo et al., 2014). In the present study, we show that some of these effects are preserved after sub-chronic (8weeks) fructose supplementation, specifically increased hepatic expression of lipid synthesis-related genes (stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ×6.7-fold; acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ×1.6-fold; glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ×1.65-fold), and reduced fatty acid β-oxidation (×0.77-fold), resulting in increased liver triglyceride content (×1.69-fold) and hepatic steatosis. However, hepatic expression of PPARα and its target genes was not modified and, further, livers of 8-week fructose-supplemented rats showed no sign of unfolded protein response activation, except for an increase in p-IRE1 levels. Hepatic mTOR phosphorylation was enhanced (×1.74-fold), causing an increase in the phosphorylation of UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK-1) (×2.8-fold), leading to a decrease in the ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I protein expression (×0.39-fold) and an increase in the amount of the autophagic substrate p62, indicative of decreased autophagy activity. A harmful cycle may be established in the liver of 8-week fructose-supplemented rats where lipid accumulation may cause defective autophagy, and reduced autophagy may result in decreased free fatty acid formation from triglyceride depots, thus reducing the substrates for β-oxidation and further increasing hepatic steatosis. In summary, the length of supplementation is a key factor in the metabolic disturbances induced by fructose: in short-term studies, PPARα inhibition and ER stress induction are critical events, whereas after sub-chronic supplementation, mTOR activation and autophagy inhibition are crucial.

Abstract: Erythrocytes and megakaryocytes (MK) are derived from a common progenitor that undergoes lineage specification. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid growth factor was previously shown to be a regulator for erythropoietic process through activating LPA receptor 3 (LPA3). However, whether LPA affects megakaryopoiesis remains unclear. In this study, we used K562 leukemia cell line as a model to investigate the roles of LPA in MK differentiation. We demonstrated that K562 cells express both LPA2 and LPA3, and the expression levels of LPA2 are higher than LPA3. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a commonly used inducer of megakaryopoiesis, reciprocally regulates the expressions of LPA2 and LPA3. By pharmacological blockers and knockdown experiments, we showed that activation of LPA2 suppresses whereas, LPA3 promotes megakaryocytic differentiation in K562. The LPA2-mediated inhibition is dependent on β-catenin translocation, whereas reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is a downstream signal for activation of LPA3. Furthermore, the hematopoietic transcriptional factors GATA-1 and FLI-1, appear to be involved in these regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggested that LPA2 and LPA3 may function as a molecular switch and play opposing roles during megakaryopoiesis of K562 cells.

Abstract: Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids for membrane synthesis and energy reserves. In this study, we characterized the lipid and protein composition of purified Caenorhabditis elegans lipid droplets. These lipid droplets are composed mainly of triacylglycerols, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer composed primarily of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid composition of the triacylglycerols is rich in fatty acid species obtained from the dietary Escherichia coli, including cyclopropane fatty acids and cis-vaccenic acid. Unlike other organisms, C. elegans lipid droplets contain very little cholesterol or cholesterol esters. Comparison of the lipid droplet proteomes of wild type and high-fat daf-2 mutant strains shows a very similar proteome in both strains, except that the most abundant protein in the C. elegans lipid droplet proteome, MDT-28, is relatively less abundant in lipid droplets isolated from daf-2 mutants. Functional analysis of lipid droplet proteins identified in our proteomic studies indicated an enrichment of proteins required for growth and fat homeostasis in C. elegans. Finally, we confirmed the localization of one of the newly identified lipid droplet proteins, ACS-4. We found that ACS-4 localizes to the surface of lipid droplets in the C. elegans intestine and skin. This study bolsters C. elegans as a model to study the dynamics and functions of lipid droplets in a multicellular organism.

Abstract: Bile acid synthesis is the major pathway for catabolism of cholesterol. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver and plays an important role in regulating lipid, glucose and energy metabolism. Transgenic mice overexpressing CYP7A1 (CYP7A1-tg mice) were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes. However the mechanism of resistance to HFD-induced obesity of CYP7A1-tg mice has not been determined. In this study, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of CYP7A1-tg mice were analyzed to explore the metabolic alterations in CYP7A1-tg mice that govern the protection against obesity and insulin resistance by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analyses. Lipidomics analysis identified seven lipid markers including lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides that were significantly decreased in serum of HFD-fed CYP7A1-tg mice. Metabolomics analysis identified 13 metabolites in bile acid synthesis including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, and tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-β-MCA) that differed between CYP7A1-tg and wild-type mice. Notably, T-β-MCA, an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was significantly increased in intestine of CYP7A1-tg mice. This study suggests that reducing 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and increasing intestinal T-β-MCA may reduce high fat diet-induced increase of phospholipids, sphingomyelins and ceramides, and ameliorate diabetes and obesity. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Linking transcription to physiology in lipodomics.

Abstract: Mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, nitric oxide and growth factors may regulate adipogenesis as well as inflammation. It is well documented that production of some form of eicosanoids activates lipid synthesis during adipogenesis but also contributes to the formation of factors maintaining low-level systemic inflammation. Developing nutrients for reduction of adipogenesis and inflammation can enhance preventive efficacy of daily diet. This study examined the effects of free fatty acid influence on changes in lipid biosynthesis and corresponding gene expression during differentiation of human subcutaneous adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells. Proadipogenic conditions promoted SVF cell differentiation and lipid droplet (LD) formation up to 15days. This correlated with gene expression of adipocyte differentiation markers as well as inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. Addition of free fatty acids to differentiation medium increased their incorporation during the first period of differentiation (48h). Presence of eicosanoid acid (EPA) during the initial period of differentiation by elevation of Perilipin 3 protein (TIP47), may be responsible for smaller LD formation. Presence of arachidonic acid (AA) tends to deposit lipids in large form of LDs. Prolongation of differentiation up to 15days decreased AA or EPA in cellular lipids. PUFA through up-regulation of both phospholipase 2 and enzymes related to eicosanoid production influenced type and quantity of eicosanoids which regulated the extent of SVF cell differentiation. Formation of small LDs and reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in adipose tissue are the consequence of eicosanoid production with anti-inflammatory potential from EPA.

Abstract: The arachidonic acid preferred long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) is a key enzyme for fatty acid metabolism in various metabolic tissues. In this study, we utilized hamsters fed a normal chow diet, a high-fat diet or a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCHFD) as animal models to explore novel transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for ACSL4 expression under hyperlipidemic conditions. Through cloning hamster ACSL4 homolog and tissue profiling ACSL4 mRNA and protein expressions we observed a selective upregulation of ACSL4 in testis and liver of HCHFD fed animals. Examination of transcriptional activators of the ACSL family revealed an increased hepatic expression of PPARδ but not PPARα in HCHFD fed hamsters. To explore a role of PPARδ in dietary cholesterol-mediated upregulation of ACSL4, we administered a PPARδ specific agonist L165041 to normolipidemic and dyslipidemic hamsters. We observed significant increases of hepatic ACSL4 mRNA and protein levels in all L165041-treated hamsters as compared to control animals. The induction of ACSL4 expression by L165041 in liver tissue in vivo was recapitulated in human primary hepatocytes and hepatocytes isolated from hamster and mouse. Moreover, employing the approach of adenovirus-mediated gene knockdown, we showed that depletion of PPARδ in hamster hepatocytes specifically reduced ACSL4 expression. Finally, utilizing HepG2 as a model system, we demonstrate that PPARδ activation leads to increased ACSL4 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and consequently higher arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity. Taken together, we have discovered a novel PPARδ-mediated regulatory mechanism for ACSL4 expression in liver tissue and cultured hepatic cells.

Abstract: Recently, endocannabinoids have emerged as signalling mediators in reproduction. It is widely accepted that anandamide (AEA) levels must be tightly regulated, and that a disturbance in AEA levels may impact decidual stability and regression. We have previously characterized the endocannabinoid machinery in rat decidual tissue and reported the pro-apoptotic action of AEA on rat decidual cells. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that plays a crucial role in early pregnancy, and is also a key modulator in the crosstalk between endocannabinoids and prostaglandins. On the other hand, AEA-oxidative metabolism by COX-2 is not merely a mean to inactivate its action, but it yields the formation of a new class of mediators, named prostaglandin-ethanolamides, or prostamides. In this study we found that AEA-induced apoptosis in decidual cells involves COX-2 metabolic pathway. AEA induced COX-2 expression through p38 MAPK, resulting in the formation of prostamide E2 (PME2). Our findings also suggest that AEA-induced effect is associated with NF-kB activation. Finally, we describe the involvement of PME2 in the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in rat decidual cells. Altogether, our findings highlight the role of COX-2 as a gatekeeper in the uterine environment and clarify the impact of the deregulation of AEA levels on the decidual remodelling process.

Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous and progressive inflammatory condition that has been linked to the dysregulation of many metabolic pathways including lipid biosynthesis. How lipid metabolism could affect disease progression in smokers with COPD remains unclear. We cross-examined the transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics data available on the public domain to elucidate the mechanisms by which lipid metabolism is perturbed in COPD. We reconstructed a sputum lipid COPD (SpLiCO) signaling network utilizing active/inactive, and functional/dysfunctional lipid-mediated signaling pathways to explore how lipid-metabolism could promote COPD pathogenesis in smokers. SpLiCO was further utilized to investigate signal amplifiers, distributers, propagators, feed-forward and/or -back loops that link COPD disease severity and hypoxia to disruption in the metabolism of sphingolipids, fatty acids and energy. Also, hypergraph analysis and calculations for dependency of molecules identified several important nodes in the network with modular regulatory and signal distribution activities. Our systems-based analyses indicate that arachidonic acid is a critical and early signal distributer that is upregulated by the sphingolipid signaling pathway in COPD, while hypoxia plays a critical role in the elevated dependency to glucose as a major energy source. Integration of SpLiCo and clinical data shows a strong association between hypoxia and the upregulation of sphingolipids in smokers with emphysema, vascular disease, hypertension and those with increased risk of lung cancer.

Abstract: Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs) are characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrotic remodeling of the interstitial tissue. A small fraction of DPLD cases can be genetically defined by mutations in certain genes, with ABCA3 being the gene most commonly affected. However, the pathomechanisms underlying ABCA3-induced DPLD are far from clear. To investigate whether ABCA3 plays a role in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, phospholipids, free cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters were quantified in cells stably expressing ABCA3 using mass spectrometry. Cellular free cholesterol and lipid droplets were visualized by filipin or oil red staining, respectively. Expression of SREBP regulated genes was measured using qPCR. Cell viability was assessed using the XTT assay. We found that wild type ABCA3 reduces cellular free cholesterol levels, induces the SREBP pathway, and renders cells more resistant to loading with exogenous cholesterol. Moreover, ABCA3 mutations found in patients with DPLD interfere with this protective effect of ABCA3, resulting in free cholesterol induced cell death. We conclude that ABCA3 plays a previously unrecognized role in the regulation of cellular cholesterol levels. Accumulation of free cholesterol as a result of a loss of ABCA3 export function represents a novel pathomechanism in ABCA3-induced DPLD.

Abstract: In the present paper we have performed comparative lipidomic analysis of two prototypic atherogenic LDL modifications, oxidized LDL and enzymatically modified LDL. Oxidization of LDL was carried out with different chemical modifications starting from the same native LDL preparations: (i) by copper oxidation leading to terminally oxidized LDL (oxLDL), (ii) by moderate oxidization with HOCl (HOCl LDL), (iii) by long term storage of LDL at 4°C to produce minimally modified LDL (mmLDL), or (iv) by 15-lipoxygenase, produced by a transfected fibroblast cell line (LipoxLDL). The enzymatic modification of LDL was performed by treatment of native LDL with trypsin and cholesteryl esterase (eLDL). Free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl esters (CE) represent the predominant lipid classes in all LDL preparations. In contrast to native LDL, which contains about two-thirds of total cholesterol as CE, enzymatic modification of LDL decreased the proportion of CE to about one-third. Free cholesterol and CE in oxLDL are reduced by their conversion to oxysterols. Oxidization of LDL preferentially influences the content of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and polyunsaturated plasmalogen species, by reducing the total PC fraction in oxLDL. Concomitantly, a strong rise of the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) fraction can be found in oxLDL as compared to native LDL. This effect is less pronounced in eLDL. The mild oxidation of LDL with hypochlorite and/or lipoxygenase does not alter the content of the analyzed lipid classes and species in a significant manner. The lipidomic characterization of modified LDLs contributes to the better understanding their diverse cellular effects.

Abstract: Five yeast enzymes synthesizing various glycerophospholipids belong to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase (CAPT) superfamily. They only share the so-called CAPT motif, which forms the active site of all these enzymes. Bioinformatic tools predict the CAPT motif of phosphatidylinositol synthase Pis1 as either ER luminal or cytosolic. To investigate the membrane topology of Pis1, unique cysteine residues were introduced into either native or a Cys-free form of Pis1 and their accessibility to the small, membrane permeating alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and mass tagged, non-permeating maleimides, in the presence and absence of non-denaturing detergents, was monitored. The results clearly point to a cytosolic location of the CAPT motif. Pis1 is highly sensitive to non-denaturing detergent, and low concentrations (0.05%) of dodecylmaltoside change the accessibility of single substituted Cys in the active site of an otherwise cysteine free version of Pis1. Slightly higher detergent concentrations inactivate the enzyme. Removal of the ER retrieval sequence from (wt) Pis1 enhances its activity, again suggesting an influence of the lipid environment. The central 84% of the Pis1 sequence can be aligned and fitted onto the 6 transmembrane helices of two recently crystallized archaeal members of the CAPT family. Results delineate the accessibility of different parts of Pis1 in their natural context and allow to critically evaluate the performance of different cysteine accessibility methods. Overall the results show that cytosolically made inositol and CDP-diacylglycerol can access the active site of the yeast PI synthase Pis1 from the cytosolic side and that Pis1 structure is strongly affected by mild detergents.

Abstract: Background
Alcohol abuse is a major risk factor for somatic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Despite their potential clinical importance, little is known about the alterations of plasma glycerophospholipid (GPL) and sphingolipid (SPL) species associated with alcohol abuse.
Methods
Plasma GPL and SPL species were quantified using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in samples from 23 male alcohol-dependent patients before and after detoxification, as well as from 20 healthy male controls.
Results
A comparison of alcohol-dependent patients with controls revealed higher phosphatidylcholine (PC; P-value=0.008) and phosphatidylinositol (PI; P-value=0.001) concentrations in patients before detoxification, and higher PI (P-value=0.001) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-based plasmalogen (PE P; P-value=0.003) concentrations after detoxification. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) were increased by acute intoxication (P-value=0.002). Sphingomyelin (SM) concentration increased during detoxification (P-value=0.011). The concentration of SM 23:0 was lower in patients (P-value=2.79×10−5), and the concentrations of ceramide Cer d18:1/16:0 and Cer d18:1/18:0 were higher in patients (P-value=2.45×10−5 and 3.73×10−5). Activity of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) in patients correlated positively with the concentrations of eight LPC species, while activity of secreted ASM was inversely correlated with several PE, PI and PC species, and positively correlated with the molar ratio of PC to SM (Pearson's r=−0.432; P-value=0.039).
Conclusion
Plasma concentrations of numerous GPL and SPL species were altered in alcohol-dependent patients. These molecules might serve as potential biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of patients and to indicate health risks associated with alcohol abuse. Our study further indicates that there are strong interactions between plasma GPL concentrations and SPL metabolism.

Abstract: Bioactive N-acylethanolamines include anti-inflammatory palmitoylethanolamide, anorexic oleoylethanolamide, and an endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide). In animal tissues, these molecules are biosynthesized from N-acylethanolamine phospholipids directly by phospholipase D-type enzyme or through multi-step routes via N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids. We previously found that mouse brain has a lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity hydrolyzing N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids to N-acylethanolamines and that this activity could be partially attributed to glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) 1. In the present study, we examined catalytic properties of GDE4, another member of the GDE family. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, murine GDE4 mostly resided in the membrane fraction. Purified GDE4 showed lysoPLD activity toward various lysophospholipids, including N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids as well as lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine. When HEK293 cells were metabolically labeled with N-[14C]palmitoylethanolamine lysophospholipid, the transient expression of GDE4 increased the [14C]palmitoylethanolamide level, while the knockdown of endogenous GDE4 decreased this level. These results suggested that GDE4 functions as an N-acylethanolamine-generating lysoPLD in living cells. Moreover, the expression of GDE4 increased most species of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which can be produced from various lysophospholipids by the lysoPLD activity of GDE4. GDE4 mRNA was widely distributed among mouse tissues including brain, stomach, ileum, colon, and testis. In conclusion, GDE4 may act as a lysoPLD, which is involved in the generation of N-acylethanolamines and LPA.

Abstract: The acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase/lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (AGPAT/LPAAT) family is a group of homologous acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases. We performed studies to better understand the subcellular localization, activity, and in vivo function of AGPAT4/LPAATδ, which we found is expressed in multiple mouse brain regions. Endogenous brain AGPAT4 and AGPAT4 overexpressed in HEK293 or Sf9 insect cells localizes to mitochondria and is resident on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Further fractionation showed that AGPAT4 is present specifically in the mitochondria and not in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (i.e. MAM). Lysates from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviral Agpat4 were tested with eight lysophospholipid species but showed an increased activity only with lysophosphatidic acid as an acyl acceptor. Analysis of Sf9 phospholipid species, however, indicated a significant 72% increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) content. We examined the content of major phospholipid species in brains of Agpat4−/− mice and found also a >50% decrease in total levels of PI relative to wildtype mice, as well as significant decreases in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but no significant differences in phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, or phosphatidic acid (PA). A compensatory upregulation of Agpats 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 may help to explain the lack of difference in PA. Our findings indicate that AGPAT4 is a mitochondrial AGPAT/LPAAT that specifically supports synthesis of brain PI, PC, and PE. This understanding may help to explain apparent redundancies in the AGPAT/LPAAT family.

Abstract: Mice lacking phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT, Pemt−/− mice) are resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity (DIO) but develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. PEMT expression is strongly induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Hence, we hypothesized that white adipose tissue (WAT) might be a key player in the protection against DIO in Pemt−/− mice. We fed Pemt−/− and Pemt+/+ mice the HFD for 2weeks, after which we examined adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis and lipolysis in WAT. Pemt−/− mice gained less body weight, had reduced WAT mass and had smaller adipocytes than Pemt+/+ mice. The protein levels of adipose differentiation markers FABP4, PPARγ and C/EBPβ were not altered by genotype, but acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression and activation was reduced in the Pemt−/− mice. The in vivo conversion of [14C]acetate to [14C]TG in WAT was also lower in Pemt−/− mice. The release of glycerol from WAT explants was comparable between Pemt+/+ and Pemt−/− mice under basal condition and in the presence of isoproterenol, indicating unaffected lipolytic capacity. Furthermore, the amounts of leptin, cytokines and chemokines in WAT were not altered by genotype in mice fed the HFD for 2weeks. However, after 10weeks of HFD, WAT from Pemt−/− mice had dramatically lower leptin, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES), and significantly higher anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 than Pemt+/+ mice. Together, our data show that PEMT deficiency did not affect the capability for differentiation and lipolysis in WAT. Decreased lipogenesis in WAT may contribute to the resistance to DIO in Pemt−/− mice.

Abstract: The rise in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome turned NAFLD as the most common cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide. Although the role of toll like receptors, especially TLR4, as activators of inflammatory pathways in liver diseases is well established, our goal was to investigate if TLR4 activation could modulate metabolic lipid pathways and alter the onset of NAFLD. We used LDL receptor-deficient mice (LDLrKO) fed with an atherogenic diet as a model. The role of TLR4 activation was evaluated by crossing LDLrKO mice with the TLR4 knockout mice. Animals were fed for 12weeks with high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD) containing 18% saturated fat and 1.25% cholesterol. TLR4/LDLr KO mice presented lower triacylglyceride (TAG) plasma levels when compared to LDLrKO, despite the type of diet ingested. HFD induced TAG and cholesterol accumulation in the liver of all mice genotypes studied, but TLR4/LDLr KO presented lower TAG accumulation than LDLrKO mice. Gene expression of TAG synthesis enzymes (ApoB100, MTTP, GPAT1 and GPAT4) was not differentially altered in TLR4/LDLr KO and LDLrKO mice. On the other hand, TLR4 deficiency enhanced the expression of several enzymes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids, as follows: ACOX, CPT-1, MTPa, MTBb, PBE and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Acyl-carnitine plasma profile showed an increase in C0 and C2 concentration in TLR4/LDLr KO group, corroborating the hypothesis of increased fat oxidation. Our results indicate that TLR4 may have an important role in the onset of steatosis, once its depletion enhances fatty acid oxidation in the liver of mice, preventing triglyceride accumulation.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCG1, is a lipid exporter involved in removal of cholesterol from cells that has been investigated for its role in foam cells formation and atherosclerosis. The mechanism by which ABC lipid transporters bind and recognise their substrates is currently unknown. In this study, we identify a critical region in the final transmembrane domain of ABCG1, which is essential for its export function and stabilisation by cholesterol, a post-translational regulatory mechanism that we have recently identified as dependent on protein ubiquitination. This transmembrane region contains several Cholesterol Recognition/interaction Amino acid Consensus (CRAC) motifs, and its inverse CARC motifs. Mutational analyses identify one CRAC motif in particular with Y667 at its core, that is especially important for transport activity to HDL as well as stability of the protein in the presence of cholesterol. In addition, we present a model of how cholesterol docks to this CRAC motif in an energetically favourable manner. This study identifies for the first time how ABCG1 can interact with cholesterol via a functional CRAC domain, which provides the first insight into the substrate–transporter interaction of an ABC lipid exporter.

Abstract: In hyperinsulinemic states including obesity and T2DM, overproduction of fatty acid and triglyceride contributes to steatosis of the liver, hyperlipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance. This effect is mediated in part by the transcriptional regulator sterol responsive element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which stimulates the expression of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. SREBP-1c is up regulated by insulin both via increased transcription of nascent full-length SREBP-1c and by enhanced proteolytic processing of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound precursor to yield the transcriptionally active n-terminal form, nSREBP-1c. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin (n-3 PUFA) prevent induction of SREBP-1c by insulin thereby reducing plasma and hepatic triglycerides. Despite widespread use of n-3 PUFA supplements to reduce triglycerides in clinical practice, the exact mechanisms underlying their hypotriglyceridemic effect remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:5 n-3) reduces nSREBP-1c by inhibiting regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of the nascent SREBP-1c. We further show that this effect of DHA is mediated both via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and by inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The inhibitory effect of AMPK on SREBP-1c processing is linked to phosphorylation of serine 365 of SREBP-1c in the rat. We have defined a novel regulatory mechanism by which n-3 PUFA inhibit induction of SREBP-1c by insulin. These findings identify AMPK as an important negative regulator of hepatic lipid synthesis and as a potential therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia in obesity and T2DM.

Abstract: T cells compose a crucial part of the immune system and require activation. The first step of T cell activation is triggered by the movement of one of their surface molecules, known as T cell receptor, into localized regions of cell membrane known as lipid rafts. Molecules called gangliosides are known to be major components of lipid rafts, but their role in T-cell activation remains to be elucidated. This review summarizes recent findings that different types of T cells require distinct ganglioside types for the activation. Control of ganglioside expression would offer a strategy targeting for specific T-cell subpopulations to treat immune diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Linking transcription to physiology in lipodomics.

Abstract: Major causes of lipid accumulation in liver are increased import or synthesis or decreased catabolism of fatty acids. The latter is caused by dysfunction of cellular organelles controlling energy homeostasis, i.e., mitochondria. Peroxisomes also appear to be an important organelle in lipid metabolism of hepatocytes, but little is known about their role in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To investigate the role of peroxisomes alongside mitochondria in excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, we used leptin-resistant db/db mice on C57BLKS background, a mouse model that develops hyperphagia-induced diabetes with obesity and NAFLD. Proteome and gene expression analyses along with lipid analyses in the liver revealed differential expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and β-oxidation, whereas genes for peroxisomal proteins were predominantly regulated.
Conclusion
Our investigations show that in fatty liver disease in combination with obesity and diabetes, the hepatocyte-protecting organelle peroxisome is altered. Hence, peroxisomes might indicate a stage of pre-NAFLD, play a role in the early development of NAFLD and appear to be a potential target for treatment and prevention of NAFLD.

Abstract: Background
Unique phosphodihydroceramides containing phosphoethanolamine and glycerol have been previously described in Porphyromonas gingivalis. Importantly, they were shown to possess pro-inflammatory properties. Other common human bacteria were screened for the presence of these lipids, and they were found, amongst others, in the oral pathogen Tannerella forsythia. To date, no detailed study into the lipids of this organism has been performed.
Methods
Lipids were extracted, separated and purified by HPTLC, and analyzed using GC-MS, ESI–MS and NMR. Of special interest was how T. forsythia acquires the metabolic precursors for the lipids studied here. This was assayed by radioactive and stable isotope incorporation using carbon-14 and deuterium labeled myo-inositol, added to the growth medium.
Results
T. forsythia synthesizes two phosphodihydroceramides (Tf GL1, Tf GL2) which are constituted by phospho-myo-inositol linked to either a 17-, 18-, or 19-carbon sphinganine, N-linked to either a branched 17:0(3-OH) or a linear 16:0(3-OH) fatty acid which, in Tf GL2, is, in turn, ester-substituted with a branched 15:0 fatty acid. T. forsythia lacks the enzymatic machinery required for myo-inositol synthesis but was found to internalize inositol from the medium for the synthesis of both Tf GL1 and Tf GL2.
Conclusion
The study describes two novel glycolipids in T. forsythia which could be essential in this organism. Their synthesis could be reliant on an external source of myo-inositol.
General significance
The effects of these unique lipids on the immune system and their role in bacterial virulence could be relevant in the search for new drug targets.

Abstract: We have investigated the effects of 5α-cholesten-3-one (5Ch3, 200 nM) on synaptic transmission in mouse diaphragm. 5Ch3 had no impact on the amplitude or frequency of miniature endplate currents (MEPCs, spontaneous secretion), but decreased the amplitude of EPCs (evoked secretion) triggered by single action potentials. Treatment with 5Ch3 increased the depression of EPC amplitude and slowed the unloading of the dye FM1-43 from synaptic vesicles (exocytosis rate) during high-frequency stimulation. The estimated recycling time of vesicles did not change, suggesting that the decline of synaptic efficiency was due to the reduction in the size of the population of vesicles involved in release. The effects of 5Ch3 on synaptic transmission may be related to changes in the phase properties of the membrane. We have found that 5Ch3 reduces the staining of synaptic regions with the B-subunit of cholera toxin (a marker of lipid rafts) and increases the fluorescence of 22-NBD-cholesterol, indicating a phase change within the membrane. Manipulations of membrane cholesterol (saturation or depletion) strongly reduced the influence of 5Ch3 on both FM1-43 dye unloading and staining with the B-subunit of cholera toxin. Thus, 5Ch3 reduces the number of vesicles which are actively recruited during synaptic transmission and alters membrane properties. These effects of 5Ch3 depend on membrane cholesterol.

Abstract: Autophagy, evoked by diverse stresses including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), profoundly affects the development of heart failure. However, the specific molecular basis of autophagy remains to be elucidated. Here we report that sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a bioactive sphingolipid, significantly suppressed apoptosis and induced autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Blocking this SPC evoked autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3MA)-sensitized cardiomyocytes to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Subsequent studies revealed that SPC downregulated the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1 (two substrates of mTOR) but enhanced that of JNK when inducing autophagy. We identified SPC as a switch for the activity of Akt1, a supposed upstream modulator of both mTOR and JNK. Furthermore, β-cyclodextrin, which destroys membrane cholesterol, abolished the SPC-reduced phosphorylation of both Akt and PTEN, thus inhibiting SPC-induced autophagy. In conclusion, SPC is a novel molecule protecting cardiomyocytes against apoptosis by promoting autophagy. The lipid raft/PTEN/Akt1/mTOR signal pathway is the underlying mechanism and might provide novel targets for cardiac failure therapy.

Abstract: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a neurometabolic disease that is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. ABCD1 protein deficiency impairs peroxisomal very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) degradation resulting in increased cytosolic VLCFA-CoA levels, which are further elongated by the VLCFA-specific elongase, ELOVL1. In adulthood, X-ALD most commonly manifests as a gradually progressive myelopathy (adrenomyeloneuropathy; AMN) without any curative or disease modifying treatments. We recently showed that bezafibrate reduces VLCFA accumulation in X-ALD fibroblasts by inhibiting ELOVL1. Although, in a clinical trial, bezafibrate was unable to lower VLCFA levels in plasma or lymphocytes in X-ALD patients, inhibition of ELOVL1 remains an attractive therapeutic option. In this study, we investigated the kinetic characteristics of ELOVL1 using X-ALD fibroblasts and microsomal fractions from ELOVL1 over-expressing HEK293 cell lines and analyzed the inhibition kinetics of a series of fibrates. Our data show that the CoA esters of bezafibrate and gemfibrozil reduce chain elongation by specifically inhibiting ELOVL1. These fibrates can therefore serve as lead compounds for the development of more potent and more specific inhibitors for ELOVL1.

Abstract: Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) generates bioactive lysophospholipids implicated in acute and chronic inflammation, but the pathophysiologic role of sPLA2 is poorly understood. Given that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the major substrate for sPLA2 in plasma, we investigated the effects of sPLA2-mediated modification of HDL (sPLA2-HDL) on neutrophil function, an essential arm of the innate immune response and atherosclerosis. Treatment of neutrophils with sPLA2-HDL rapidly prevented agonist-induced neutrophil activation, including shape change, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, CD11b activation, adhesion under flow and migration of neutrophils. The cholesterol-mobilizing activity of sPLA2-HDL was markedly increased when compared to native HDL, promoting a significant reduction of cholesterol-rich signaling microdomains integral to cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, sPLA2-HDL effectively suppressed agonist-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Native HDL showed no significant effects and removing lysophospholipids from sPLA2-HDL abolished all anti-inflammatory activities. Overall, our studies suggest that the increased cholesterol-mobilizing activity of sPLA2-HDL and suppression of rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels are likely mechanism that counteracts agonist-induced activation of neutrophils. These counterintuitive findings imply that neutrophil trafficking and effector responses are altered by sPLA2-HDL during inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) is well known to stimulate the expression of pro-fibrotic connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in several cell types including human mesangial cells. The present study demonstrates that TGF-β2 enhances sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5 (S1P5) mRNA and protein expression in a time and concentration dependent manner. Pharmacological and siRNA approaches reveal that this upregulation is mediated via activation of classical TGF-β downstream effectors, Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Most notably, inhibition of Gi with pertussis toxin and downregulation of S1P5 by siRNA block TGF-β2-stimulated upregulation of CTGF, demonstrating that Gi coupled S1P5 is necessary for TGF-β2-triggered expression of CTGF in human mesangial cells. Overall, these findings indicate that TGF-β2 dependent upregulation of S1P5 is required for the induction of pro-fibrotic CTGF by TGF-β. Targeting S1P5 might be an attractive novel approach to treat renal fibrotic diseases.

The capacity for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis in a carnivorous vertebrate: Functional characterisation and nutritional regulation of a Fads2 fatty acyl desaturase with Δ4 activity and an Elovl5 elongase in striped snakehead (Channa striata),

Abstract: The endogenous production of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in carnivorous teleost species inhabiting freshwater environments is poorly understood. Although a predatory lifestyle could potentially supply sufficient LC-PUFA to satisfy the requirements of these species, the nutrient-poor characteristics of the freshwater food web could impede this advantage. In this study, we report the cloning and functional characterisation of an elongase enzyme in the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway from striped snakehead (Channa striata), which is a strict freshwater piscivore that shows high deposition of LC-PUFA in its flesh. We also functionally characterised a previously isolated fatty acyl desaturase cDNA from this species. Results showed that the striped snakehead desaturase is capable of Δ4 and Δ5 desaturation activities, while the elongase showed the characteristics of Elovl5 elongases. Collectively, these findings reveal that striped snakehead exhibits the genetic resources to synthesise docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3). Both genes are expressed at considerable levels in the brain and the liver. In liver, both genes were up-regulated by dietary C18 PUFA, although this increase did not correspond to a significant rise in the deposition of muscle LC-PUFA. Brain tissue of fish fed with plant oil diets showed higher expression of fads2 gene compared to fish fed with fish oil-based diet, which could ensure DHA levels remain constant under limited dietary DHA intake. This suggests the importance of DHA production from EPA via the ∆4 desaturation step in order to maintain an optimal reserve of DHA in the neuronal tissues of carnivores.

Abstract: Coq9 is a polypeptide subunit in a mitochondrial multi-subunit complex, termed the CoQ-synthome, required for biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q). Deletion of COQ9 results in dissociation of the CoQ-synthome, but over-expression of Coq8 putative kinase stabilizes the CoQ-synthome in the coq9 null mutant and leads to the accumulation of two nitrogen-containing Q intermediates, imino-demethoxy-Q6 (IDMQ6) and 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol (4-AP) when para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) is provided as a ring precursor. To investigate whether Coq9 is responsible for deamination steps in Q biosynthesis, we utilized the yeast coq5-5 point mutant. The yeast coq5-5 point mutant is defective in the C-methyltransferase step of Q biosynthesis but retains normal steady-state levels of the Coq5 polypeptide. Here, we show that when high amounts of 13C6-pABA are provided, the coq5-5 mutant accumulates both 13C6-imino-demethyl-demethoxy-Q6 (13C6-IDDMQ6) and 13C6-demethyl-demethoxy-Q6 (13C6-DDMQ6). Deletion of COQ9 in the yeast coq5-5 mutant along with Coq8 over-expression and 13C6- pABA labeling leads to the absence of 13C6-DDMQ6, and the nitrogen-containing intermediates 13C6-4-AP and 13C6-IDDMQ6 persist. We describe a coq9 temperature-sensitive mutant and show that at the non-permissive temperature, steady-state polypeptide levels of Coq9-ts19 increased, while Coq4, Coq5, Coq6, and Coq7 decreased. The coq9-ts19 mutant had decreased Q6 content and increased levels of nitrogen-containing intermediates. These findings identify Coq9 as a multi-functional protein that is required for the function of Coq6 and Coq7 hydroxylases, for removal of the nitrogen substituent from pABA-derived Q intermediates, and is an essential component of the CoQ synthome.

Abstract: The present study presents the first “in vivo” evidence of enzymatic activity and nutritional regulation of a Δ4-desaturase-dependent DHA synthesis pathway in the teleost Solea senegalensis. Juvenile fish were fed diets containing 2 lipid levels (8 and 18%, LL and HL) with either 100% fish oil (FO) or 75% of the FO replaced by vegetable oils (VOs). Fatty acyl elongation (Elovl5) and desaturation (Δ4Fad) activities were measured in isolated enterocytes and hepatocytes incubated with radiolabeled α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n−3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n−3). Tissue distributions of elovl5 and Δ4fad transcripts were also determined, and the transcriptional regulation of these genes in liver and intestine was assessed at fasting and postprandially. DHA biosynthesis from EPA occurred in both cell types, although Elovl5 and Δ4Fad activities tended to be higher in hepatocytes. In contrast, no Δ6Fad activity was detected on 14C-ALA, which was only elongated to 20:3n−3. Enzymatic activities and gene transcription were modulated by dietary lipid level (LL>HL) and fatty acid (FA) composition (VO>FO), more significantly in the liver than in the intestine, which was reflected in tissue FA compositions. Dietary VO induced a significant up-regulation of Δ4fad transcripts in the liver 6h after feeding, whereas in fasting conditions the effect of lipid level possibly prevailed over or interacted with FA composition in regulating the expression of elovl5 and Δ4fad, which were down-regulated in the liver of fish fed the HL diets. Results indicated functionality and biological relevance of the Δ4 LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway in S. senegalensis.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in the regulation of energy homeostasis by initiating neural and hormonal responses to the ingestion of nutrients. In addition to peptide hormones, such as cholecystokinin (CKK) and peptide YY (PYY), the lipid-derived mediator oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been implicated in the control of satiety. Previous studies in humans and rodent models have shown that obesity is associated with changes in CCK, PYY and other gut-derived peptide hormones, which may contribute to decreased satiety and increased energy intake. In the present study, we show that small-intestinal OEA production is disrupted in the gut of diet-induced obese (DIO) rats and mice. In lean rodents, feeding or duodenal infusion of Intralipid® or pure oleic acid stimulates jejunal OEA mobilization. This response is strikingly absent in DIO rats and mice. Confirming previous reports, we found that feeding rats or mice a high-fat diet for 7days is sufficient to suppress jejunal OEA mobilization. Surprisingly, a similar effect is elicited by feeding rats and mice a high-sucrose low-fat diet for 7days. Collectively, our findings suggest that high fat-induced obesity is accompanied by alterations in the post-digestive machinery responsible for OEA biosynthesis, which may contribute to reduced satiety and hyperphagia.

CTGF/CCN2 exerts profibrotic action in myoblasts via the up-regulation of sphingosine kinase-1/S1P3 signaling axis: Implications in the action mechanism of TGFβ,

Abstract: The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is recognized as key player in the onset of fibrosis in various tissues, including skeletal muscle. In many circumstances, CTGF has been shown to be induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and accounting, at least in part, for its biological action. In this study it was verified that in cultured myoblasts CTGF/CCN2 causes their transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts by up-regulating the expression of fibrosis marker proteins α-smooth muscle actin and transgelin. Interestingly, it was also found that the profibrotic effect exerted by CTGF/CCN2 was mediated by the sphingosine kinase (SK)-1/S1P3 signaling axis specifically induced by the treatment with the profibrotic cue. Following CTGF/CCN2-induced up-regulation, S1P3 became the S1P receptor subtype expressed at the highest degree, at least at mRNA level, and was thus capable of readdressing the sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling towards fibrosis rather than myogenic differentiation. Another interesting finding is that CTGF/CCN2 silencing prevented the TGFβ-dependent up-regulation of SK1/S1P3 signaling axis and strongly reduced the profibrotic effect exerted by TGFβ, pointing at a crucial role of endogenous CTGF/CCN2 generated following TGFβ challenge in the transmission of at least part of its profibrotic effect. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which CTGF/CCN2 drives its biological action and strengthen the concept that SK1/S1P3 axis plays a critical role in the onset of fibrotic cell phenotype.
