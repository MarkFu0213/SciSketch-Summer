Abstract: Summary
Many inflammation-associated diseases, including cancers, increase in women after menopause and with obesity. In contrast to anti-inflammatory actions of 17β-estradiol, we find estrone, which dominates after menopause, is pro-inflammatory. In human mammary adipocytes, cytokine expression increases with obesity, menopause, and cancer. Adipocyte:cancer cell interaction stimulates estrone- and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation. Estrone- and 17β-estradiol-driven transcriptomes differ. Estrone:ERα stimulates NFκB-mediated cytokine gene induction; 17β-estradiol opposes this. In obese mice, estrone increases and 17β-estradiol relieves inflammation. Estrone drives more rapid ER+ breast cancer growth in vivo. HSD17B14, which converts 17β-estradiol to estrone, associates with poor ER+ breast cancer outcome. Estrone and HSD17B14 upregulate inflammation, ALDH1 activity, and tumorspheres, while 17β-estradiol and HSD17B14 knockdown oppose these. Finally, a high intratumor estrone:17β-estradiol ratio increases tumor-initiating stem cells and ER+ cancer growth in vivo. These findings help explain why postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer increases with obesity, and offer new strategies for prevention and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) commonly involves both myeloid and erythroid lineage transformation. However, the mutations that cause AEL and the cell(s) that sustain the bilineage leukemia phenotype remain unknown. We here show that combined biallelic Cebpa and Gata2 zinc finger-1 (ZnF1) mutations cooperatively induce bilineage AEL, and that the major leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) population has a neutrophil-monocyte progenitor (NMP) phenotype. In pre-leukemic NMPs Cebpa and Gata2 mutations synergize by increasing erythroid transcription factor (TF) expression and erythroid TF chromatin access, respectively, thereby installing ectopic erythroid potential. This erythroid-permissive chromatin conformation is retained in bilineage LICs. These results demonstrate that synergistic transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming by leukemia-initiating mutations can generate neomorphic pre-leukemic progenitors, defining the lineage identity of the resulting leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated intracellular and extracellular signaling is critical to synapse development and functional neural circuit wiring. Here, we report that unesterified docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regulates functional synapse formation in vivo via retinoid X receptor α (Rxra) signaling. Using Rxra conditional knockout (cKO) mice and virus-mediated transient gene expression, we show that endogenous Rxra plays important roles in regulating spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. We further show that the effects of RXRA are mediated through its DNA-binding domain in a cell-autonomous and reversible manner. Moreover, unesterified DHA increases spine formation and excitatory synaptic transmission in vivo in an Rxra-dependent fashion. Rxra cKO mice generally behave normally but show deficits in behavior tasks associated with social memory. Together, these results demonstrate that unesterified DHA signals through RXRA to regulate spinogenesis and functional synapse formation, providing insight into the mechanism through which DHA promotes brain development and cognitive function.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of DNA methylation and mRNA alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) are both prevalent in cancer and have been studied as independent processes. We discovered a DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism when we compared genome-wide DNA methylation and polyadenylation site usage between DNA methylation-competent and DNA methylation-deficient cells. Here, we show that removal of DNA methylation enables CTCF binding and recruitment of the cohesin complex, which, in turn, form chromatin loops that promote proximal polyadenylation site usage. In this DNA demethylated context, either deletion of the CTCF binding site or depletion of RAD21 cohesin complex protein can recover distal polyadenylation site usage. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we authenticated the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA polyadenylation isoform expression in vivo. This DNA methylation-regulated APA mechanism demonstrates how aberrant DNA methylation impacts transcriptome diversity and highlights the potential sequelae of global DNA methylation inhibition as a cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Firing activity of external globus pallidus (GPe) is crucial for motor control and is severely perturbed in dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive muscle contractions. Here, we show that GPe projection neurons exhibit a reduction of firing frequency and an irregular pattern in a DYT1 dystonia model. Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits. Our findings demonstrate an impaired striatopallidal connectivity, supporting the central role of GPe in motor control and, more importantly, identifying potential pharmacological targets for dystonia.

Abstract: Summary
Investigating mechanisms that regulate endothelial cell (EC) growth and survival is important for understanding EC homeostasis and how ECs maintain stem cell niches. We report here that targeted loss of Id genes in adult ECs results in dilated, leaky sinusoids and a pro-inflammatory state that increases in severity over time. Disruption in sinusoidal integrity leads to increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, differentiation, migration, and exhaustion. Mechanistically, sinusoidal ECs (SECs) show increased apoptosis because of reduced Bcl2-family gene expression following Id gene ablation. Furthermore, Id1−/−Id3−/− SECs and upstream type H vessels show increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 and impaired ability to proliferate, which is rescued by reducing E2-2 expression. Id1−/−Id3−/− mice do not survive sublethal irradiation because of impaired vessel regeneration and hematopoietic failure. Thus, Id genes are required for the survival and regeneration of BM SECs during homeostasis and stress to maintain HSC development.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of chronic caloric restriction (CR) on health and survival is complex with poorly understood underlying molecular mechanisms. A recent study in mice addressing the diets used in nonhuman primate CR studies found that while diet composition did not impact longevity, fasting time and total calorie intake were determinant for increased survival. Here, integrated analysis of physiological and multi-omics data from ad libitum, meal-fed, or CR animals was used to gain insight into pathways associated with improved health and survival. We identified a potential involvement of the glycine-serine-threonine metabolic axis in longevity and related molecular mechanisms. Direct comparison of the different feeding strategies unveiled a pattern of shared pathways of improved health that included short-chain fatty acids and essential PUFA metabolism. These findings were recapitulated in the serum metabolome from nonhuman primates. We propose that the pathways identified might be targeted for their potential role in healthy aging.

Abstract: Thyroid hormones are essential for metabolic rate regulation and play a role on the integrity of the salivary glands. Nigella sativa is a widely used plant in medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) on the hypothyroidism-induced parotid gland pathological alterations. Rats were divided into four groups: control group, hypothyroid group: received daily oral carbimazole for 3 weeks, hypothyroid-NSO group: NSO was orally given for 4 weeks after hypothyroidism induction and NSO group: administrated NSO only for 4 weeks. After 7 weeks, all rats were sacrificed, serum thyroid hormones were estimated, and parotid glands were assessed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometric analyses. Hypothyroid group showed a significant decrease in thyroid hormones with increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and decrease in body and parotid weights compared to the control rats that were improved with NSO treatment. Sections of the hypothyroid group showed fibrosis, acinar cytoplasmic vacuolations, vascular congestion, ductal dilatation, wide intercellular canaliculi, nuclear pyknosis and decreased number of secretory granules. Also, there were decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and increased p53, Bcl-2 Associated X (Bax) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) immune-expressions; with decreased Bax/ Bcl-2 ratio that all were attenuated by NSO. NSO ameliorates hypothyroidism-induced parotid changes by altering p53, Bax and Bcl-2 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Human antibody SIgN-3C neutralizes dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) differently. DENV:SIgN-3C Fab and ZIKV:SIgN-3C Fab cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) complex structures show Fabs crosslink E protein dimers at extracellular pH 8.0 condition and also when further incubated at acidic endosomal conditions (pH 8.0–6.5). We observe Fab binding to DENV (pH 8.0–5.0) prevents virus fusion, and the number of bound Fabs increase (from 120 to 180). For ZIKV, although there are already 180 copies of Fab at pH 8.0, virus structural changes at pH 5.0 are not inhibited. The immunoglobulin G (IgG):DENV structure at pH 8.0 shows both Fab arms bind to epitopes around the 2-fold vertex. On ZIKV, an additional Fab around the 5-fold vertex at pH 8.0 suggests one IgG arm would engage with an epitope, although the other may bind to other viruses, causing aggregation. For DENV2 at pH 5.0, a similar scenario would occur, suggesting DENV2:IgG complex would aggregate in the endosome. Hence, a single antibody employs different neutralization mechanisms against different flaviviruses.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome 16p11.2 duplications dramatically increase risk for schizophrenia, but the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that mice with an equivalent genetic mutation (16p11.2 duplication mice) exhibit impaired hippocampal-orbitofrontal and hippocampal-amygdala functional connectivity. Expression of schizophrenia-relevant GABAergic cell markers (parvalbumin and calbindin) is selectively decreased in orbitofrontal cortex, while somatostatin expression is decreased in lateral amygdala. When 16p11.2 duplication mice are tested in cognitive tasks dependent on hippocampal-orbitofrontal connectivity, performance is impaired in an 8-arm maze “N-back” working memory task and in a touchscreen continuous performance task. Consistent with hippocampal-amygdala dysconnectivity, deficits in ethologically relevant social behaviors are also observed. Overall, the cellular/molecular, brain network, and behavioral alterations markedly mirror those observed in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, the data suggest that 16p11.2 duplications selectively impact hippocampal-amygdaloid-orbitofrontal circuitry, supporting emerging ideas that dysfunction in this network is a core element of schizophrenia and defining a neural circuit endophenotype for the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Complex networks of regulatory relationships between protein kinases comprise a major component of intracellular signaling. Although many kinase-kinase regulatory relationships have been described in detail, these tend to be limited to well-studied kinases whereas the majority of possible relationships remains unexplored. Here, we implement a data-driven, supervised machine learning method to predict human kinase-kinase regulatory relationships and whether they have activating or inhibiting effects. We incorporate high-throughput data, kinase specificity profiles, and structural information to produce our predictions. The results successfully recapitulate previously annotated regulatory relationships and can reconstruct known signaling pathways from the ground up. The full network of predictions is relatively sparse, with the vast majority of relationships assigned low probabilities. However, it nevertheless suggests denser modes of inter-kinase regulation than normally considered in intracellular signaling research. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical pyramidal cells are generated locally, from pre-programmed progenitors, to form functionally distinct areas. By contrast, striatal projection neurons (SPNs) are generated remotely from a common source, undergo migration to form mosaics of striosomes and matrix, and become incorporated into functionally distinct sectors. Striatal circuits might thus have a unique logic of developmental organization, distinct from those of the neocortex. We explore this possibility in mice by mapping one set of SPNs, those in striosomes, with striatonigral projections to the dopamine-containing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Same-age SPNs exhibit topographic striatonigral projections, according to their resident sector. However, the different birth dates of resident SPNs within a given sector specify the destination of their axons within the SNpc. These findings highlight a logic intercalating birth date-dependent and birth date-independent factors in determining the trajectories of SPN axons and organizing specialized units of striatonigral circuitry that could influence behavioral expression and vulnerabilities to disease.

Abstract: Summary
Concomitant with DNA replication, the chromosomal cohesin complex establishes cohesion between newly replicated sister chromatids. Several replication-fork-associated “cohesion establishment factors,” including the multifunctional Ctf18-RFC complex, aid this process in as yet unknown ways. Here, we show that Ctf18-RFC’s role in sister chromatid cohesion correlates with PCNA loading but is separable from its role in the replication checkpoint. Ctf18-RFC loads PCNA with a slight preference for the leading strand, which is dispensable for DNA replication. Conversely, the canonical Rfc1-RFC complex preferentially loads PCNA onto the lagging strand, which is crucial for DNA replication but dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion. The downstream effector of Ctf18-RFC is cohesin acetylation, which we place toward a late step during replication maturation. Our results suggest that Ctf18-RFC enriches and balances PCNA levels at the replication fork, beyond the needs of DNA replication, to promote establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and possibly other post-replicative processes.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the neural basis of behavior, it is important to reveal how movements are planned, executed, and refined by networks of neurons distributed throughout the nervous system. Here, we report the neuroanatomical organization and behavioral roles of cerebellospinal (CeS) neurons. Using intersectional genetic techniques, we find that CeS neurons constitute a small minority of excitatory neurons in the fastigial and interpositus deep cerebellar nuclei, target pre-motor circuits in the ventral spinal cord and the brain, and control distinct aspects of movement. CeS neurons that project to the ipsilateral cervical cord are required for skilled forelimb performance, while CeS neurons that project to the contralateral cervical cord are involved in skilled locomotor learning. Together, this work establishes CeS neurons as a critical component of the neural circuitry for skilled movements and provides insights into the organizational logic of motor networks.

Abstract: Summary
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) confer health benefits by preventing inflammation and obesity and by increasing thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes. As well as being supplied exogenously as nutrients, PUFAs are largely stored in membrane glycerophospholipids and released by phospholipase A2s (PLA2s). However, the molecular identity of the PLA2 subtype(s) that supplies endogenous PUFAs for metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Here we show that PLA2G2D, a secreted PLA2 isoform, is constitutively expressed in M2-type macrophages in white adipose tissue (WAT) and shows a reciprocal correlation with obesity. Studies using global and macrophage-specific Pla2g2d-deficient mice reveal that PLA2G2D increases energy expenditure and thermogenesis by facilitating adipocyte browning, thereby ameliorating diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and WAT inflammation. Mechanistically, PLA2G2D constitutively supplies a pool of PUFAs, ω3 in particular, in WAT. Thus, our present findings underscore the contribution of the macrophage-driven PLA2G2D-ω3 PUFA axis to metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being innate, displays of aggression are influenced by cortical activities. Here, using Vglut1 as a marker for inputs from cortical structures, we identify a small population of excitatory neurons located in the posterior amygdala (PA) that project to the ventrolateral division of ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHvl), a region that critically regulates territorial aggression. Indeed, activities of PA Vglut1+ (PAVglut1) neurons, as analyzed by post hoc c-Fos expression, differentiate trials in which attacks occur, or not, during resident-intruder assays. More importantly, chemogenetic activation of VMHvl-projecting PAVglut1 neurons robustly promote aggression while inhibition of these neurons reduces attacks. Finally, a connectivity map places VMHvl-projecting PAVglut1 neurons at the interface between emotion regulation and aggression as they receive broad inputs from limbic structures and project collaterally to the VMHvl and other targets. Taken together, these results point to VMHvl-projecting PAVglut1 neurons as a potential site for cortical gating of territorial aggression.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of a compound of concentrated growth factor (CGF) and periodontal ligament stem cell-derived conditioned medium (PDLSCs-CM) as a potential product for future applications in periodontal tissue regeneration. Isolated PDLSCs were characterized using flow cytometry and differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes cells. PDLSCs-CM and CGF were prepared and lyophilized. To determine the optimal concentration of the CGF-CM compound, the proliferation of PDLSCs after exposure to a wide range of different concentrations of CGF, CM, or their combination (CGF + CM) was investigated by methyl thiazol tetrazolium assay. Successful isolation of PDLSCs was confirmed by high expression of mesenchymal surface markers and differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes. PDLSCs showed higher proliferation in the 6.25 mg/mL concentration of CM and 94 μg/mL concentration of CGF. High concentrations of CGF and CM markedly inhibited the proliferation of PDLCs (p < 0.05). The exposure of PDLSCs to the compound of 10% CM + 90% CGF significantly increased the cell proliferation (p < 0.05). The results showed that CGF, CM, or their combination exert a proliferative effect on cells at a certain concentration. Further investigation on the synergistic effect of this compound may approve its application for periodontal regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is the only first-line therapy for advanced HCC despite its serious adverse effects. Here, we report that at an equivalent of approximately one-tenth the clinical dose for HCC, sorafenib treatment effectively prevents the progression of NASH in both mice and monkeys without any observed significant adverse events. Mechanistically, sorafenib’s benefit in NASH is independent of its canonical kinase targets in HCC, but involves the induction of mild mitochondrial uncoupling and subsequent activation of AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK). Collectively, our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated therapeutic effect and signaling mechanism of low-dose sorafenib treatment in NASH. We envision that this new therapeutic strategy for NASH has the potential to translate into a beneficial anti-NASH therapy with fewer adverse events than is observed in the drug’s current use in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal neoplasm. To identify candidate tumor suppressors we applied CRISPR/Cas9 gene inactivation screens to a cellular model of early-stage SCLC. Among the top hits was MAX, the obligate heterodimerization partner for MYC family proteins that is mutated in human SCLC. Max deletion increases growth and transformation in cells and dramatically accelerates SCLC progression in an Rb1/Trp53-deleted mouse model. In contrast, deletion of Max abrogates tumorigenesis in MYCL-overexpressing SCLC. Max deletion in SCLC resulted in derepression of metabolic genes involved in serine and one-carbon metabolism. By increasing serine biosynthesis, Max-deleted cells exhibit resistance to serine depletion. Thus, Max loss results in metabolic rewiring and context-specific tumor suppression.

Abstract: Neurons have multiple dendrites and single axon. This neuronal polarity is gradually established during early processes of neuronal differentiation: generation of multiple neurites (stages 1-2); differentiation (stage 3) and maturation (stages 4-5) of an axon and dendrites. In this study, we demonstrated that the neuron-specific n-glycosylated protein NELL2 is important for neuronal polarization and axon growth using cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons. Endogenous NELL2 expression was gradually increased in parallel with the progression of developmental stages of hippocampal neurons, and overexpression of NELL2 stimulated neuronal polarization and axon growth. In line with these results, knockdown of NELL2 expression resulted in deterioration of neuronal development, including inhibition of neuronal development progression, decreased axon growth and increased axon branching. Inhibitor against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) dramatically inhibited NELL2-induced progression of neuronal development and axon growth. These results suggest that NELL2 is an important regulator for the morphological development for neuronal polarization and axon growth.

Abstract: Summary
Impairment of ribosome function activates the MAPKKK ZAK, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 and JNK and inflammatory signaling. The mechanistic basis for activation of this ribotoxic stress response (RSR) remains completely obscure. We show that the long isoform of ZAK (ZAKα) directly associates with ribosomes by inserting its flexible C terminus into the ribosomal intersubunit space. Here, ZAKα binds helix 14 of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). An adjacent domain in ZAKα also probes the ribosome, and together, these sensor domains are critically required for RSR activation after inhibition of both the E-site, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), and ribotoxin action. Finally, we show that ablation of the RSR response leads to organismal phenotypes and decreased lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Our findings yield mechanistic insight into how cells detect ribotoxic stress and provide experimental in vivo evidence for its physiological importance.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cell (EC) metabolism is an emerging target for anti-angiogenic therapy in tumor angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization (CNV), but little is known about individual EC metabolic transcriptomes. By single-cell RNA sequencing 28,337 murine choroidal ECs (CECs) and sprouting CNV-ECs, we constructed a taxonomy to characterize their heterogeneity. Comparison with murine lung tumor ECs (TECs) revealed congruent marker gene expression by distinct EC phenotypes across tissues and diseases, suggesting similar angiogenic mechanisms. Trajectory inference predicted that differentiation of venous to angiogenic ECs was accompanied by metabolic transcriptome plasticity. ECs displayed metabolic transcriptome heterogeneity during cell-cycle progression and in quiescence. Hypothesizing that conserved genes are important, we used an integrated analysis, based on congruent transcriptome analysis, CEC-tailored genome-scale metabolic modeling, and gene expression meta-analysis in cross-species datasets, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation, to identify SQLE and ALDH18A1 as previously unknown metabolic angiogenic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Unbiased and dense sampling of large populations of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) reveals two functional sub-populations: neurons tuned and untuned to drifting gratings. Whether functional interactions between these two groups contribute to the representation of visual stimuli is unclear. To examine these interactions, we summarize the population partial pairwise correlation structure as a directed and weighted graph. We find that tuned and untuned neurons have distinct topological properties, with untuned neurons occupying central positions in functional networks (FNs). Implementation of a decoder that utilizes the topology of these FNs yields accurate decoding of visual stimuli. We further show that decoding performance degrades comparably following manipulations of either tuned or untuned neurons. Our results demonstrate that untuned neurons are an integral component of V1 FNs and suggest that network interactions contain information about the stimulus that is accessible to downstream elements.

Abstract: We attempted to investigate the relationship between hsa-let-7c and ANP32E, as well as their influence on the cells phenotype of lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of hsa-let-7c and prognostic values were assessed by bioinformatics analysis based on TCGA database. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot was employed to measure relative expression of hsa-let-7c or ANP32E. The targeting relationship between let-7c and ANP32E was predicted by biological software and validated by dual luciferase reporter assay. With gene transfection technology, cell proliferation, invasion and migration were appraised by cell counting Kit-8, clone formation and Transwell assays. The results showed that hsa-let-7c was downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Downregulation of hsa-let-7c notably led to a poor survival. ANP32E was forecasted and confirmed as a directly target of hsa-let-7c, and was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, upregulation of ANP32E had a significant correlation with unsatisfactory survival. Meanwhile, the levels of ANP32E were negatively regulated by hsa-let-7c. Upregulation of hsa-let-7c remarkably suppressed the Calu-3 cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while ANP32E overexpression plasmids rescued the downtrend. Inversely, hsa-let-7c silencing in NCI-H209 cells presented the opposite outcomes. Collectively, hsa-let-7c shows an anti-tumor effect in lung adenocarcinoma by targeting ANP32E and is expected to be a potential therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Protozoan parasites in the genus Leishmania produce a broad spectrum of diseases in their human hosts. The strain and species-specific genes controlling these diverse clinical outcomes have remained poorly tractable using reverse genetics approaches. A cryptic sexual cycle involving a meiotic-like process has been described in Leishmania but is so far confined to parasites growing in the sand fly vector. Here, we describe the reproducible in vitro generation of hybrid clones using axenic culture forms of Leishmania tropica promastigotes. Analysis of SNPs marker inheritance and whole-genome sequencing data indicate that the progeny clones are full genomic hybrids. The demonstration that mating-competent forms arise in culture should facilitate experimental study of the mating biology of Leishmania and the generation of large numbers of recombinant parasites for positional cloning of important genes.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to altered gene expression, pathological cytoskeletal dynamics in the axon are another key intrinsic barrier for axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that knocking out myosin IIA and IIB (myosin IIA/B) in retinal ganglion cells alone, either before or after optic nerve crush, induces significant optic nerve regeneration. Combined Lin28a overexpression and myosin IIA/B knockout lead to an additive promoting effect and long-distance axon regeneration. Immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and western blot analyses reveal that myosin II deletion does not affect known axon regeneration signaling pathways or the expression of regeneration-associated genes. Instead, it abolishes the retraction bulb formation and significantly enhances the axon extension efficiency. The study provides clear evidence that directly targeting neuronal cytoskeleton is sufficient to induce significant CNS axon regeneration and that combining altered gene expression in the soma and modified cytoskeletal dynamics in the axon is a promising approach for long-distance CNS axon regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired function of pancreatic islet cells is a major cause of metabolic dysregulation and disease in humans. Despite this, it remains challenging to directly link physiological dysfunction in islet cells to precise changes in gene expression. Here we show that single-cell RNA sequencing combined with electrophysiological measurements of exocytosis and channel activity (patch-seq) can be used to link endocrine physiology and transcriptomes at the single-cell level. We collected 1,369 patch-seq cells from the pancreata of 34 human donors with and without diabetes. An analysis of function and gene expression networks identified a gene set associated with functional heterogeneity in β cells that can be used to predict electrophysiology. We also report transcriptional programs underlying dysfunction in type 2 diabetes and extend this approach to cryopreserved cells from donors with type 1 diabetes, generating a valuable resource for understanding islet cell heterogeneity in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive evaluation of single T cell functions such as cytokine secretion and cytolysis of target cells is greatly needed in adoptive cell therapy (ACT) but has never been fully fulfilled by current approaches. Herein, we develop a hierarchical loading microwell chip (HL-Chip) that aligns multiple cells and functionalized beads in a high-throughput microwell array with single-cell/bead precision based on size differences. We demonstrate the potential of the HL-Chip in evaluating single T cell functions by three applications: high-throughput longitudinal secretory profiling of single T cells, large-scale evaluation of cytolytic activity of single T cells, and integrated T cell-tumor cell interactions. The HL-Chip is a simple and robust technology that constructs arrays of defined cell/object combinations for multiple measurements and material retrieval.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand the influence of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on the initial steps of skin carcinogenesis, we examine patches of labeled keratinocytes as a proxy for clones in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and measure their size variation upon UVB irradiation. Multicolor lineage tracing reveals that in chronically irradiated skin, patches near hair follicles (HFs) increase in size, whereas those far from follicles do not change. This is explained by proliferation of basal epidermal cells within 60 μm of HF openings. Upon interruption of UVB, patch size near HFs regresses significantly. These anatomical differences in proliferative behavior have significant consequences for the cell of origin of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Indeed, a UV-inducible murine BCC model shows that BCC patches are more frequent, larger, and more invasive near HFs. These findings have major implications for the prevention of field cancerization in the epidermis.

Abstract: Summary
Immunodeficiencies are typically caused by loss-of-function mutations in lymphocyte-specific genes. Occasionally, mutations in ubiquitous general-purpose factors, including those affecting essential components of the DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) holoenzyme, have cell-type-specific consequences. POLE3, one of the four components of the POLE holoenzyme, features a histone fold domain and a unique acidic C terminus, making it a particularly attractive candidate mediating cell type-specific activities of POLE. Mice lacking Pole3 survive up to late embryonic stages, indicating that this subunit is dispensable for DNA replication. The phenotypes of viable hypomorphic and neomorphic alleles are surprisingly tissue restricted and reveal a stage-specific function of the histone fold domain of Pole3 during T and B cell development. Gradual introduction of positively charged residues into the acidic C terminus leads to peripheral lymphopenia of increasing severity. Our findings serve as a paradigm to understand the molecular basis of cell-type-specific non-replicative functions of the ubiquitous POLE complex.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymatic probes of chromatin structure reveal accessible versus inaccessible chromatin states, while super-resolution microscopy reveals a continuum of chromatin compaction states. Characterizing histone H2B movements by single-molecule tracking (SMT), we resolved chromatin domains ranging from low to high mobility and displaying different subnuclear localizations patterns. Heterochromatin constituents correlated with the lowest mobility chromatin, whereas transcription factors varied widely with regard to their respective mobility with low- or high-mobility chromatin. Pioneer transcription factors, which bind nucleosomes, can access the low-mobility chromatin domains, whereas weak or non-nucleosome binding factors are excluded from the domains and enriched in higher mobility domains. Nonspecific DNA and nucleosome binding accounted for most of the low mobility of strong nucleosome interactor FOXA1. Our analysis shows how the parameters of the mobility of chromatin-bound factors, but not their diffusion behaviors or SMT-residence times within chromatin, distinguish functional characteristics of different chromatin-interacting proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is driven by co-existing mutations in KRAS and TP53. However, how these mutations collaborate to promote this cancer is unknown. Here, we uncover sequence-specific changes in RNA splicing enforced by mutant p53 which enhance KRAS activity. Mutant p53 increases expression of splicing regulator hnRNPK to promote inclusion of cytosine-rich exons within GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), negative regulators of RAS family members. Mutant p53-enforced GAP isoforms lose cell membrane association, leading to heightened KRAS activity. Preventing cytosine-rich exon inclusion in mutant KRAS/p53 PDACs decreases tumor growth. Moreover, mutant p53 PDACs are sensitized to inhibition of splicing via spliceosome inhibitors. These data provide insight into co-enrichment of KRAS and p53 mutations and therapeutics targeting this mechanism in PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus often produce nausea, vomiting, and in some patients, undesired anorexia. Notably, these behavioral effects are caused by direct central GLP-1R activation. Herein, we describe the creation of a GLP-1R agonist conjugate with modified brain penetrance that enhances GLP-1R-mediated glycemic control without inducing vomiting. Covalent attachment of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4) to dicyanocobinamide (Cbi), a corrin ring containing precursor of vitamin B12, produces a “corrinated” Ex4 construct (Cbi-Ex4). Data collected in the musk shrew (Suncus murinus), an emetic mammal, reveal beneficial effects of Cbi-Ex4 relative to Ex4, as evidenced by improvements in glycemic responses in glucose tolerance tests and a profound reduction of emetic events. Our findings highlight the potential for clinical use of Cbi-Ex4 for millions of patients seeking improved glycemic control without common side effects (e.g., emesis) characteristic of current GLP-1 therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Germline epigenetic factors influence transgenerational inheritance of behavioral traits upon changes in experience and environment. Immune activation due to infection can also modulate brain function, but whether this experience can be passed down to offspring remains unknown. Here, we show that infection of the male lineage with the common human parasite Toxoplasma results in transgenerational behavioral changes in offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Small RNA sequencing of sperm reveals significant transcriptional differences of infected animals compared to controls. Zygote microinjection of total small RNA from sperm of infected mice partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotype of naturally born offspring, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of behavioral inheritance in the first generation. Our results demonstrate that sperm epigenetic factors can contribute to intergenerational inheritance of behavioral changes after pathogenic infection, which could have major public health implications.

Abstract: Summary
Medulloblastoma (MB) is a neoplasm linked to dysregulated cerebellar development. Previously, we demonstrated that the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup grows hierarchically, with Sox2+ cells at the apex of tumor progression and relapse. To test whether this mechanism is rooted in a normal developmental process, we studied the role of Sox2 in cerebellar development. We find that the external germinal layer (EGL) is derived from embryonic Sox2+ precursors and that the EGL maintains a rare fraction of Sox2+ cells during the first postnatal week. Through lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, we demonstrate that these Sox2+ cells are within the Atoh1+ lineage, contribute extensively to adult granule neurons, and resemble Sox2+ tumor cells. Critically, constitutive activation of the SHH pathway leads to their aberrant persistence in the EGL and rapid tumor onset. We propose that failure to eliminate this rare but potent developmental population is the tumor initiation mechanism in SHH-subgroup MB.

Abstract: B lymphocytes are an important component of the adaptive and innate immune system because of their ability to secrete antibodies and to present antigens to T cells, which is critical for immune responses to many pathogens. Abnormal B cell function is the cause of diseases including autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and immunodeficiency disorders. The development, survival, and function of B cells depend on signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) and costimulatory receptors. One of the signaling pathways induced by antigen binding to the BCR is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which depends on the Ca2+ channel ORAI1 and its activators stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 and 2. A recent study by Berry et al. [1] reports that B cells lacking STIM1 and STIM2 fail to survive and proliferate because abolished SOCE results in impaired expression of two key anti-apoptotic genes and blunted activation of mTORC1 and c-Myc signaling. The associated Ca2+ regulated checkpoints of B cell survival and proliferation can be bypassed, at least partially, by costimulation through CD40 or TLR9. This study provides important new insights on how SOCE controls B cell function.

Abstract: Summary
Tbr1 is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene encoding a transcription factor with distinct pre- and postnatal functions. Postnatally, Tbr1 conditional knockout (CKO) mutants and constitutive heterozygotes have immature dendritic spines and reduced synaptic density. Tbr1 regulates expression of several genes that underlie synaptic defects, including a kinesin (Kif1a) and a WNT-signaling ligand (Wnt7b). Furthermore, Tbr1 mutant corticothalamic neurons have reduced thalamic axonal arborization. LiCl and a GSK3β inhibitor, two WNT-signaling agonists, robustly rescue the dendritic spines and the synaptic and axonal defects, suggesting that this could have relevance for therapeutic approaches in some forms of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic contributions of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast cancer progression remain to be fully understood. While altered glucose metabolism in CAFs could fuel cancer cells, how such metabolic reprogramming emerges and is sustained needs further investigation. Studying fibroblasts isolated from patients with benign breast tissues and breast cancer, in conjunction with multiple animal models, we demonstrate that CAFs exhibit a metabolic shift toward lactate and pyruvate production and fuel biosynthetic pathways of cancer cells. The depletion or suppression of the lactate production of CAFs alter the tumor metabolic profile and impede tumor growth. The glycolytic phenotype of the CAFs is in part sustained through epigenetic reprogramming of HIF-1α and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia induces epigenetic reprogramming of normal fibroblasts, resulting in a pro-glycolytic, CAF-like transcriptome. Our findings suggest that the glucose metabolism of CAFs evolves during tumor progression, and their breast cancer-promoting phenotype is partly mediated by oxygen-dependent epigenetic modifications.

Abstract: Summary
B cells produce high amounts of cytokines and immunoglobulins in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Calcium signaling cascades are critically involved in cytokine production of T cells, and the cytosolic calcium concentration is regulated by calcium-activated monovalent cation channels (CAMs). Calcium signaling is also implicated in B cell activation; however, its involvement in the cytokine production of LPS-stimulated B cells remains less well characterized. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5), which is one of the CAMs, negatively modulates calcium signaling, thereby regulating LPS-induced proliferative and inflammatory responses by B cells. LPS-stimulated B cells of Trpm5-deficient mice exhibit an increased cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to enhanced proliferation and the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and CXCL10. Furthermore, Trpm5-deficient mice show an exacerbation of endotoxic shock with high mortality. Our findings demonstrate the importance of TRPM5-dependent regulatory mechanisms in LPS-induced calcium signaling of splenic B cells.

Abstract: Summary
Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a highly lethal malignancy that mainly afflicts young individuals of African descent and is resistant to all targeted agents used to treat other renal cell carcinomas. Comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling of untreated primary RMC tissues was performed to elucidate the molecular landscape of these tumors. We found that RMC was characterized by high replication stress and an abundance of focal copy-number alterations associated with activation of the stimulator of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase interferon genes (cGAS-STING) innate immune pathway. Replication stress conferred a therapeutic vulnerability to drugs targeting DNA-damage repair pathways. Elucidation of these previously unknown RMC hallmarks paves the way to new clinical trials for this rare but highly lethal malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cells establish apicobasal polarity by forming tight junctions (TJs) at the apical-lateral boundary, which play fundamental roles in physiological functions. An evolutionarily conserved atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-partitioning defective (PAR) complex functions as a platform for TJ assembly during cell polarity establishment. However, how this complex converts the spatial cues into a subsequent active unit is unclear. Here, we identify an epithelial isoform of Shank2 as a mediator of the aPKC-PAR complex. Shank2 binds to and colocalizes with aPKC at apical junctional regions of polarized epithelial cells. Shank2 knockdown results in defects in TJ formation. Mechanistically, we find that the N-terminal SPN domain is required for the junctional localization of Shank2 and binds to the active form of Rap1 small GTPase, which is involved in TJ formation. Our findings suggest that a close physical and functional relationship between aPKC and Shank2-active Rap1 signaling serves as the platform for TJ assembly to regulate epithelial cell polarity.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely assumed that decreasing transcription factor DNA-binding affinity reduces transcription initiation by diminishing occupancy of sequence-specific regulatory elements. However, in vivo transcription factors find their binding sites while confronted with a large excess of low-affinity degenerate motifs. Here, using the melanoma lineage survival oncogene MITF as a model, we show that low-affinity binding sites act as a competitive reservoir in vivo from which transcription factors are released by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-stimulated acetylation to promote increased occupancy of their regulatory elements. Consequently, a low-DNA-binding-affinity acetylation-mimetic MITF mutation supports melanocyte development and drives tumorigenesis, whereas a high-affinity non-acetylatable mutant does not. The results reveal a paradoxical acetylation-mediated molecular clutch that tunes transcription factor availability via genome-wide redistribution and couples BRAF to tumorigenesis. Our results further suggest that p300/CREB-binding protein-mediated transcription factor acetylation may represent a common mechanism to control transcription factor availability.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons and oligodendrocytes communicate to regulate oligodendrocyte development and ensure appropriate axonal myelination. Here, we show that Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) signaling underlies a neuronal pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation through the release of soluble neuronally derived factors. Mice lacking global or neuronal GDE2 expression have reduced mature oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins but retain normal numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Wild-type (WT) OPCs cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from Gde2-null (Gde2KO) neurons exhibit delayed maturation, recapitulating in vivo phenotypes. Gde2KO neurons show robust reduction in canonical Wnt signaling, and genetic activation of Wnt signaling in Gde2KO neurons rescues in vivo and in vitro oligodendrocyte maturation. Phosphacan, a known stimulant of oligodendrocyte maturation, is reduced in CM from Gde2KO neurons but is restored when Wnt signaling is activated. These studies identify GDE2 control of Wnt signaling as a neuronal pathway that signals to oligodendroglia to promote oligodendrocyte maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Although cellular stress response is important for maintaining function and survival, overactivation of late-stage stress effectors cause dysfunction and death. We show that the myelin transcription factors (TFs) Myt1 (Nzf2), Myt2 (Myt1l, Nztf1, and Png-1), and Myt3 (St18 and Nzf3) prevent such overactivation in islet β cells. Thus, we found that co-inactivating the Myt TFs in mouse pancreatic progenitors compromised postnatal β cell function, proliferation, and survival, preceded by upregulation of late-stage stress-response genes activating transcription factors (e.g., Atf4) and heat-shock proteins (Hsps). Myt1 binds putative enhancers of Atf4 and Hsps, whose overexpression largely recapitulated the Myt-mutant phenotypes. Moreover, Myt(MYT)-TF levels were upregulated in mouse and human β cells during metabolic stress-induced compensation but downregulated in dysfunctional type 2 diabetic (T2D) human β cells. Lastly, MYT knockdown caused stress-gene overactivation and death in human EndoC-βH1 cells. These findings suggest that Myt TFs are essential restrictors of stress-response overactivity.

Abstract: Summary
The human genome encodes millions of regulatory elements, of which only a small fraction are active within a given cell type. Little is known about the global impact of chromatin remodelers on regulatory DNA landscapes and how this translates to gene expression. We use precision genome engineering to reawaken homozygously inactivated SMARCA4, a central ATPase of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Here, we combine DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modification, and transcriptional profiling to show that SMARCA4 dramatically increases both the number and magnitude of accessible chromatin sites genome-wide, chiefly by unmasking sites of low regulatory factor occupancy. By contrast, transcriptional changes are concentrated within well-demarcated remodeling domains wherein expression of specific genes is gated by both distal element activation and promoter chromatin configuration. Our results provide a perspective on how global chromatin remodeling activity is translated to gene expression via regulatory DNA.

Abstract: TRPV1 and TRPA1 are cation channels that play key roles in inflammatory signaling pathways. They are co-expressed on airway C-fibers, where they exert synergistic effects on causing inflammation and cough. Licorice, the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, has been widely used in China as an anti-inflammatory and anti-coughing herb. To learn if TRPV1 and TRPA1 might be key targets of the anti-inflammatory and antitussive effects of licorice, we examined liquiritin, the main flavonoid compound and active ingredient of licorice, on agonist-evoked TRPV1 and TRPA1 activation. Liquiritin inhibited capsaicin- and allyl isothiocyanate-evoked TRPV1 and TRPA1 whole-cell currents, respectively, with a similar potency and maximal inhibition. In a mouse acute lung injury (ALI) model induced by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, which involves both TRPV1 and TRPA1, an oral gavage of liquiritin prevented tissue damage and suppressed inflammation and the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in the lung tissue. Liquiritin also suppressed LPS-induced increase in TRPV1 and TRPA1 protein expression in the lung tissue, as well as TRPV1 and TRPA1 mRNA levels in cells contained in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In cultured THP-1 monocytes, liguiritin, or TRPV1 and TRPA1 antagonists capsazepine and HC030031, respectively, diminished not only cytokine-induced upregulation of NF-κB function but also TRPV1 and TRPA1 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory and antitussive effects of liquiritin are mediated by the dual inhibition of TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, which are upregulated in nonneuronal cells through the NF-κB pathway during airway inflammation via a positive feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosome separation in late G2/ early prophase requires precise spatial coordination that is determined by a balance of forces promoting and antagonizing separation. The major effector of centrosome separation is the kinesin Eg5. However, the identity and regulation of Eg5-antagonizing forces is less well characterized. By manipulating candidate components, we find that centrosome separation is reversible and that separated centrosomes congress toward a central position underneath the flat nucleus. This positioning mechanism requires microtubule polymerization, as well as actin polymerization. We identify perinuclear actin structures that form in late G2/early prophase and interact with microtubules emanating from the centrosomes. Disrupting these structures by breaking the interactions of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex with perinuclear actin filaments abrogates this centrosome positioning mechanism and causes an increase in subsequent chromosome segregation errors. Our results demonstrate how geometrical cues from the cell nucleus coordinate the orientation of the emanating spindle poles before nuclear envelope breakdown.

Abstract: Recently, oxytocin (OT) has been studied as a potential modulator of endogenous analgesia by acting upon pain circuits at the spinal cord and supraspinal levels. Yet the detailed action mechanisms of OT are still undetermined. The present study aimed to evaluate the action of OT in the spinal cord dorsal horn network under nociceptive-like conditions induced by the activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and formalin injection, using calcium imaging techniques. Results demonstrate that the spontaneous Ca2+-dependent activity of the dorsal horn cells was scarce, and the coactivity of cells was mainly absent. When NMDA was applied, high rates of activity and coactivity occurred in the dorsal horn cells; these rates of high activity mimicked the activity dynamics evoked by a neuropathic pain condition. In addition, although OT treatment increased activity rates, it was also capable of disrupting the conformation of coordinated activity previously consolidated by NMDA treatment, without showing any effect by itself. Altogether, our results suggest that OT globally prevents the formation of coordinated patterns previously generated by nociceptive-like conditions on dorsal horn cells by NMDA application, which supports previous evidence showing that OT represents a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Summary
Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug administered at suboptimal and intermittent doses to avoid life-threatening effects. Although this regimen shortly improves symptoms in the short term, it also leads to more malignant disease in the long term. We describe a multilayered analysis ranging from chromatin to translation—integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and ribosome profiling—to understand how cisplatin confers (pre)malignant features by using a well-established ovarian cancer model of cisplatin exposure. This approach allows us to segregate the human transcriptome into gene modules representing distinct regulatory principles and to characterize that the most cisplatin-disrupted modules are associated with underlying events of super-enhancer plasticity. These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death. Using a PageRank-based algorithm, we predict super-enhancer regulator ISL1 as a driver of this plasticity and validate this prediction by using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB inhibition (CRISPRi) and CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation (CRISPRa) tools. Together, we propose that cisplatin reprograms cancer cells when inducing them to undergo near-to-death experiences.

Abstract: Summary
Translation regulation occurs largely during the initiation phase. Here, we develop selective 40S footprinting to visualize initiating 40S ribosomes on endogenous mRNAs in vivo. This reveals the positions on mRNAs where initiation factors join the ribosome to act and where they leave. We discover that in most human cells, most scanning ribosomes remain attached to the 5′ cap. Consequently, only one ribosome scans a 5′ UTR at a time, and 5′ UTR length affects translation efficiency. We discover that eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B,) eIF4G1, and eIF4E remain bound to 80S ribosomes as they begin translating, with a decay half-length of ∼12 codons. Hence, ribosomes retain these initiation factors while translating short upstream open reading frames (uORFs), providing an explanation for how ribosomes can reinitiate translation after uORFs in humans. This method will be of use for studying translation initiation mechanisms in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an unmet clinical challenge due to the rapid increase in its occurrence but the lack of approved drugs to treat it. Further unraveling of the molecular mechanisms underlying NASH may identify potential successful drug targets for this condition. Here, we identified TNFAIP3 interacting protein 3 (TNIP3) as a novel inhibitor of NASH. Hepatocyte-specific TNIP3 transgenic overexpression attenuates NASH in two dietary models in mice. Mechanistically, this inhibitory effect of TNIP3 is independent of its conventional role as an inhibitor of TNFAIP3. Rather, TNIP3 directly interacts with TAK1 and inhibits its ubiquitination and activation by the E3 ligase TRIM8 in hepatocytes in response to metabolic stress. Notably, adenovirus-mediated TNIP3 expression in the liver substantially blocks NASH progression in mice. These results suggest that TNIP3 may be a promising therapeutic target for NASH management.

Abstract: Summary
The anti-leukemia agent forodesine causes cytotoxic overload of intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) but is efficacious only in a subset of patients. We report that SAMHD1, a phosphohydrolase degrading deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), protects cells against the effects of dNTP imbalances. SAMHD1-deficient cells induce intrinsic apoptosis upon provision of deoxyribonucleosides, particularly deoxyguanosine (dG). Moreover, dG and forodesine act synergistically to kill cells lacking SAMHD1. Using mass cytometry, we find that these compounds kill SAMHD1-deficient malignant cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Normal cells and CLL cells from patients without SAMHD1 mutation are unaffected. We therefore propose to use forodesine as a precision medicine for leukemia, stratifying patients by SAMHD1 genotype or expression.

Abstract: Oral-Facial-Digital type I (OFD1) is a rare inherited form of renal cystic disease associated with ciliary dysfunction. This disorder is due to mutations in the OFD1 gene that encodes a protein localized to centrosomes and basal bodies in different cell types. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that OFD1 displays a dynamic distribution during cell cycle. High-content microscopy analysis of Ofd1-depleted fibroblasts revealed impaired cell cycle progression. Immunofluorescence analysis and cell proliferation assays also indicated the presence of a variety of defects such as centrosome accumulation, nuclear abnormalities and aneuploidy. In addition, Ofd1-depleted cells displayed an abnormal microtubule network that may underlie these defects. All together our results suggest that OFD1 contributes to the function of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in the cell, controlling cell cycle progression both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Fast purinergic signaling is mediated by ATP and ATP-gated ionotropic P2X receptors (P2XRs), and it is implicated in pain-related behaviors. The properties exhibited by P2XRs vary between those expressed in heterologous cells and in vivo. Several modulators of ligand-gated ion channels have recently been identified, suggesting that there are P2XR functional modulators in vivo. Here, we establish a genome-wide open reading frame (ORF) collection and perform functional screening to identify modulators of P2XR activity. We identify TMEM163, which specifically modulates the channel properties and pharmacology of P2XRs. We also find that TMEM163 is required for full function of the neuronal P2XR and a pain-related ATP-evoked behavior. These results establish TMEM163 as a critical modulator of P2XRs in vivo and a potential target for the discovery of drugs for treating pain.

Abstract: Summary
Although thousands of solid tumors have been sequenced to date, a fundamental under-sampling bias is inherent in current methodologies. This is caused by a tissue sample input of fixed dimensions (e.g., 6 mm biopsy), which becomes grossly under-powered as tumor volume scales. Here, we demonstrate representative sequencing (Rep-Seq) as a new method to achieve unbiased tumor tissue sampling. Rep-Seq uses fixed residual tumor material, which is homogenized and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Analysis of intratumor tumor mutation burden (TMB) variability shows a high level of misclassification using current single-biopsy methods, with 20% of lung and 52% of bladder tumors having at least one biopsy with high TMB but low clonal TMB overall. Misclassification rates by contrast are reduced to 2% (lung) and 4% (bladder) when a more representative sampling methodology is used. Rep-Seq offers an improved sampling protocol for tumor profiling, with significant potential for improved clinical utility and more accurate deconvolution of clonal structure.

Abstract: Summary
The Toll/IL-1R-domain-containing adaptor protein SARM1 is expressed primarily in the brain, where it mediates axonal degeneration. Roles for SARM1 in TLR signaling, viral infection, inflammasome activation, and chemokine and Xaf1 expression have also been described. Much of the evidence for SARM1 function relies on SARM1-deficient mice generated in 129 ESCs and backcrossed to B6. The Sarm1 gene lies in a gene-rich region encompassing Xaf1 and chemokine loci, which remain 129 in sequence. We therefore generated additional knockout strains on the B6 background, confirming the role of SARM1 in axonal degeneration and WNV infection, but not in VSV or LACV infection, or in chemokine or Xaf1 expression. Sequence variation in proapoptotic Xaf1 between B6 and 129 results in coding changes and distinct splice variants, which may account for phenotypes previously attributed to SARM1. Reevaluation of phenotypes in these strains will be critical for understanding the function of SARM1.

Abstract: Summary
ATRX gene mutations have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disabilities in humans. ATRX is known to maintain genomic stability in neuroprogenitor cells, but its function in differentiated neurons and memory processes remains largely unresolved. Here, we show that the deletion of neuronal Atrx in mice leads to distinct hippocampal structural defects, fewer presynaptic vesicles, and an enlarged postsynaptic area at CA1 apical dendrite-axon junctions. We identify male-specific impairments in long-term contextual memory and in synaptic gene expression, linked to altered miR-137 levels. We show that ATRX directly binds to the miR-137 locus and that the enrichment of the suppressive histone mark H3K27me3 is significantly reduced upon the loss of ATRX. We conclude that the ablation of ATRX in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to sexually dimorphic effects on miR-137 expression and on spatial memory, identifying a potential therapeutic target for neurological defects caused by ATRX dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The combination of aging populations with the obesity pandemic results in an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases. Here, we show that the enigmatic adenosine A2B receptor (A2B) is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (SKM) as well as brown adipose tissue (BAT) and might be targeted to counteract age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) as well as obesity. Mice with SKM-specific deletion of A2B exhibited sarcopenia, diminished muscle strength, and reduced energy expenditure (EE), whereas pharmacological A2B activation counteracted these processes. Adipose tissue-specific ablation of A2B exacerbated age-related processes and reduced BAT EE, whereas A2B stimulation ameliorated obesity. In humans, A2B expression correlated with EE in SKM, BAT activity, and abundance of thermogenic adipocytes in white fat. Moreover, A2B agonist treatment increased EE from human adipocytes, myocytes, and muscle explants. Mechanistically, A2B forms heterodimers required for adenosine signaling. Overall, adenosine/A2B signaling links muscle and BAT and has both anti-aging and anti–obesity potential.

Abstract: Diphenhydramine (DPH) has been broadly used to treat allergy. When used as a topical medicine, DPH temporarily relieves itching and pain. Although transient receptor potential type A1 (TRPA1) channel is known to play roles in both acute and chronic itch and pain, whether DPH affects the activities of TRPA1 remains unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we demonstrated that DPH modulates the voltage-dependence of TRPA1. When co-applied with a TRPA1 agonist, DPH significantly enhanced the inward currents while suppressing the outward currents of TRPA1, converting the channel from outwardly rectifying to inwardly rectifying. This effect of DPH occurred no matter TRPA1 was activated by an electrophilic or non-electrophilic agonist and for both mouse and human TRPA1. The modulation of TRPA1 by DPH was maintained in the L906C mutant, which by itself also causes inward rectification of TRPA1, indicating that additional acting sites are present for the modulation of TRPA1 currents by DPH. Our recordings also revealed that DPH partially blocked capsaicin evoked TRPV1 currents. These data suggest that DPH may exert its therapeutic effects on itch and pain, through modulation of TRPA1 in a voltage-dependent fashion.

Abstract: Summary
DNA topological stress inhibits DNA replication fork (RF) progression and contributes to DNA replication stress. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that centromeric DNA and the rDNA array are especially vulnerable to DNA topological stress during replication. The activity of the SMC complexes cohesin and condensin are linked to both the generation and repair of DNA topological-stress-linked damage in these regions. At cohesin-enriched centromeres, cohesin activity causes the accumulation of DNA damage, RF rotation, and pre-catenation, confirming that cohesin-dependent DNA topological stress impacts on normal replication progression. In contrast, at the rDNA, cohesin and condensin activity inhibit the repair of damage caused by DNA topological stress. We propose that, as well as generally acting to ensure faithful genetic inheritance, SMCs can disrupt genome stability by trapping DNA topological stress.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription elongation rates influence RNA processing, but sequence-specific regulation is poorly understood. We addressed this in vivo, analyzing RNAPI in S. cerevisiae. Mapping RNAPI by Miller chromatin spreads or UV crosslinking revealed 5′ enrichment and strikingly uneven local polymerase occupancy along the rDNA, indicating substantial variation in transcription speed. Two features of the nascent transcript correlated with RNAPI distribution: folding energy and GC content in the transcription bubble. In vitro experiments confirmed that strong RNA structures close to the polymerase promote forward translocation and limit backtracking, whereas high GC in the transcription bubble slows elongation. A mathematical model for RNAPI elongation confirmed the importance of nascent RNA folding in transcription. RNAPI from S. pombe was similarly sensitive to transcript folding, as were S. cerevisiae RNAPII and RNAPIII. For RNAPII, unstructured RNA, which favors slowed elongation, was associated with faster cotranscriptional splicing and proximal splice site use, indicating regulatory significance for transcript folding.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a huge number of human deaths. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for this virus (SARS-CoV-2). The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. Here, we describe the near-atomic-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex consisting of the nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 toward humans with a relatively lower body temperature than the natural bat hosts.

Abstract: The main goal of this study was to assess the effect of different sterilization treatment for sterilization of decellularized kidney tissue. Rabbit kidneys were decellularized by the perfusion-based method using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100. Then, decellularized kidney slices were prepared and sterilized by an antibiotic cocktail, PAA (0.5 %, 1% and 1.5 %), 5KG γ-irradiation and 320–480 nm UV-irradiation. Histological evaluations, DNA quantification assay, MTT assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mechanical test and bacterial and fungal culture tests were performed to determine the quality of decellularization and sterilization processes. The kidney slices were seeded by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) to assess the cell adhesion capability after treatment. The results of the current study indicated that PAA 0.5 % was the most efficient method to completely decontaminate rabbit decellularized kidney tissue while preserving the mechanical properties and main components of the matrix which are necessary for cell-matrix interaction and cell adhesion. The 5KG γ-irradiation was determined to be the most destructive sterilization method, with reduced the mechanical strengths as well as altered microstructure of the kidney matrix and no cell adhesion. In addition, UV-irradiation is not able to sterile the decellularized tissues. Therefore PAA 0.5 % sterilization method can be a powerful means for sterilization of biological scaffolds.

Abstract: Summary
Host genetic factors play a fundamental role in regulating humoral immunity to viral infection, including influenza A virus (IAV). Here, we utilize the Collaborative Cross (CC), a mouse genetic reference population, to study genetic regulation of variation in antibody response following IAV infection. CC mice show significant heritable variation in the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody response. We map 23 genetic loci associated with this variation. Analysis of a subset of these loci finds that they broadly affect the antibody response to IAV as well as other viruses. Candidate genes are identified based on predicted variant consequences and haplotype-specific expression patterns, and several show overlap with genes identified in human mapping studies. These findings demonstrate that the host antibody response to IAV infection is under complex genetic control and highlight the utility of the CC in modeling and identifying genetic factors with translational relevance to human health and disease.

Abstract: Brush cells have recently been classified as solitary chemosensory cells. However, tracheal brush cells have not been morphologically and immunohistochemically characterized yet. In the present study, the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of tracheal brush cells were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and scanning, and transmission electron microscopies. Brush cells in the tracheal epithelium were barrel-like or columnar in shape and were immunoreactive for villin. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies revealed densely arranged thick microvilli on the apical surface of tracheal brush cells and tubular membranous elements and/or vesicular formations in the supranuclear region. A morphometrical analysis of tracheal whole-mount preparations showed that the density of brush cells was greater in the cranial third and the mucosa on the annular ligament. Double immunofluorescence revealed that the morphology of villin-immunoreactive brush cells was distinct from other non-ciliated cells in the tracheal epithelium, i.e., MUC5AC-immunoreactive mucous cells, SNAP25-immunoreactive neuroendocrine cells, and GNAT3-immunoreactive solitary chemosensory cells. On the other hand, tracheal brush cells were immunoreactive for the marker proteins for intestinal brush cells, CK18, DCLK1, and Cox1; however, these antibodies also recognized cells other than brush cells. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for PKD2L1, a cation channel subunit, was detected in brush cells. The present results demonstrated that tracheal brush cells are independent cell types. These brush cells may be activated by acid and the secretion of prostaglandins. In conclusion, the present study revealed that tracheal brush cells are independent cell types based on the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the airway and alveolar epithelial cells and disrupts the intercellular junctions, leading to increased paracellular permeability. Although this pathological change plays a critical role in lung tissue injury and secondary infection, the molecular mechanism of IAV-induced damage to the alveolar barrier remains obscure. Here, we report that Gli1, a transcription factor in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, is cross-activated by the MAP and PI3 kinase pathways in H1N1 virus (PR8)-infected A549 cells and in the lungs of H1N1 virus-infected mice. Gli1 activation induces Snail expression, which downregulates the expression of intercellular junction proteins, including E-cadherin, ZO-1, and Occludin, and increases paracellular permeability. Inhibition of the Shh pathway restores the levels of Snail and intercellular junction proteins in H1N1-infected cells. Our study suggests that Gli1 activation plays an important role in disrupting the intercellular junctions and in promoting the pathogenesis of H1N1 virus infections.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammasomes control the bioactivity of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the interleukin (IL)-1 family. The inflammasome assembled by NLRP3 has been predominantly studied in homogeneous cell populations in vitro, neglecting the influence of cellular interactions that occur in vivo. Here, we show that platelets boost the inflammasome capacity of human macrophages and neutrophils and are critical for IL-1 production by monocytes. Platelets license NLRP3 transcription, thereby enhancing ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activity, and IL-1β secretion. Platelets influence IL-1β production in vivo, and blood platelet counts correlate with plasmatic IL-1β levels in malaria. Furthermore, we reveal an enriched platelet gene signature among the highest-expressed transcripts in IL-1β-driven autoinflammatory diseases. The platelet effect is independent of cell-to-cell contact, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids, and a host of platelet cytokines, and it involves the triggering of calcium-sensing receptors on macrophages. Hence, platelets provide an additional layer of regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1-driven inflammation.

However, it is not clear if these peptides physiologically change in these organs in response to fasting.
Methods
Rats were subdivided into four groups: (A) fed ad libitum, (B) fed with restrictions (once a day) (C) fast for 48 h and (D) fast for 48 h and then fed 1 h before sacrifice. Immunosorbent assay was used to possibly reveal TLQPp changes upon fasting in plasma as well as in pancreas, adrenal gland, stomach and adipose tissues. In the latter organs, we also measured the levels of the VGF precursor protein while immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the presence of the TLQP-21 receptors.
Results
During fasting, TLQPp were down-regulated in the stomach (45 %), pancreas (47 %), adrenal gland (51 %) and WAT (45.2 %) in parallel with a significant increase in the blood (36.6 %), all versus ad libitum group. In the same organs where the TLQPp were decreased upon fasting, the VGF precursor levels were not changed. In ad libitum rats, TLQP-21 receptors were well represented within the same cells that expressed TLQPp, suggesting an autocrine activity to be better investigated.
Conclusions
During fasting, TLQPp are probably produced and immediately secreted into the blood circulation, until the hypoglycaemia is counteracted.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral nerve injury induces functional and structural remodeling of neural circuits along the somatosensory pathways, forming the basis for somatotopic reorganization and ectopic sensations, such as referred phantom pain. However, the mechanisms underlying that remodeling remain largely unknown. Whisker sensory nerve injury drives functional remodeling in the somatosensory thalamus: the number of afferent inputs to each thalamic neuron increases from one to many. Here, we report that extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated tonic inhibition is necessary for that remodeling. Extrasynaptic GABAAR currents were potentiated rapidly after nerve injury in advance of remodeling. Pharmacological activation of the thalamic extrasynaptic GABAARs in intact mice induced similar remodeling. Notably, conditional deletion of extrasynaptic GABAARs in the thalamus rescued both the injury-induced remodeling and the ectopic mechanical hypersensitivity. Together, our results reveal a molecular basis for injury-induced remodeling of neural circuits and may provide a new pharmacological target for referred phantom sensations after peripheral nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they kill invading pathogens. However, they may also act as early temporary shelters, favoring subsequent pathogen dissemination in the host. We find that TLR7 sensing of the protozoan Leishmania parasite in neutrophils is essential for early parasite load regulation. Neutrophil effector functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, are decreased in the absence of TLR7, resulting in higher parasite load and selective parasite replication in Tlr7−/− neutrophils. Leishmania-infected Tlr7−/− mice develop a chronic unhealing lesion, despite Th1 cell differentiation, and we show that Tlr7−/− neutrophils alone mediate this effect. Conversely, topical treatment with a TLR7 agonist early in infection induces smaller lesion development than in untreated mice. Collectively, these findings highlight that parasite TLR7 triggering in neutrophils regulates early innate functions with major consequences on subsequent disease evolution, opening avenues for possible treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic allergic itch is a common symptom affecting millions of people and animals, but its pathogenesis is not fully explained. Herein, we show that periostin, abundantly expressed in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), induces itch in mice, dogs, and monkeys. We identify the integrin αVβ3 expressed on a subset of sensory neurons as the periostin receptor. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we inhibited the function of neuronal integrin αVβ3, which significantly reduces periostin-induced itch in mice. Furthermore, we show that the cytokine TSLP, the application of AD-causing MC903 (calcipotriol), and house dust mites all induce periostin secretion. Finally, we establish that the JAK/STAT pathway is a key regulator of periostin secretion in keratinocytes. Altogether, our results identify a TSLP-periostin reciprocal activation loop that links the skin to the spinal cord via peripheral sensory neurons, and we characterize the non-canonical functional role of an integrin in itch.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are nanomachines used by bacteria to inject toxic effectors into competitors. The identity and mechanism of many effectors remain unknown. We characterized a Salmonella T6SS antibacterial effector called Tlde1 that is toxic in target-cell periplasm and is neutralized by its cognate immunity protein (Tldi1). Microscopy analysis reveals that cells expressing Tlde1 stop dividing and lose cell envelope integrity. Bioinformatic analysis uncovers similarities between Tlde1 and the catalytic domain of l,d-transpeptidases. Point mutations on conserved catalytic residues abrogate toxicity. Biochemical assays reveal that Tlde1 displays both l,d-carboxypeptidase activity by cleaving peptidoglycan tetrapeptides between meso-diaminopimelic acid3 and d-alanine4 and l,d-transpeptidase exchange activity by replacing d-alanine4 by a non-canonical d-amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Tlde1 homologs constitute a family of T6SS-associated effectors broadly distributed among Proteobacteria. This work expands our current knowledge about bacterial effectors used in interbacterial competition and reveals a different mechanism of bacterial antagonism.

Abstract: Summary
Cas9 is a prokaryotic RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that binds substrates tightly in vitro but turns over rapidly when used to manipulate genomes in eukaryotic cells. Little is known about the factors responsible for dislodging Cas9 or how they influence genome engineering. Unbiased detection through proximity labeling of transient protein interactions in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extract identified the dimeric histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) as an interactor of substrate-bound Cas9. FACT is both necessary and sufficient to displace dCas9, and FACT immunodepletion converts Cas9’s activity from multi-turnover to single turnover. In human cells, FACT depletion extends dCas9 residence times, delays genome editing, and alters the balance between indel formation and homology-directed repair. FACT knockdown also increases epigenetic marking by dCas9-based transcriptional effectors with a concomitant enhancement of transcriptional modulation. FACT thus shapes the intrinsic cellular response to Cas9-based genome manipulation most likely by determining Cas9 residence times.

Abstract: Summary
TRAP1 is the mitochondrial paralog of the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone family. Its activity as an energy metabolism regulator has important implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia. Selective inhibitors of TRAP1 could inform on its mechanisms of action and set the stage for targeted drug development, but their identification was hampered by the similarity among active sites in HSP90 homologs. We use a dynamics-based approach to identify a TRAP1 allosteric pocket distal to its active site that can host drug-like molecules, and we select small molecules with optimal stereochemical features to target the pocket. These leads inhibit TRAP1, but not HSP90, ATPase activity and revert TRAP1-dependent downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase activity in cancer cells and in zebrafish larvae. TRAP1 inhibitors are not toxic per se, but they abolish tumorigenic growth of neoplastic cells. Our results indicate that exploiting conformational dynamics can expand the chemical space of chaperone antagonists to TRAP1-specific inhibitors with wide therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been implicated in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. To determine the diagnostic capacity of this association, we compared stool microbiomes across 163 well-characterized participants encompassing non-NAFLD controls, NAFLD-cirrhosis patients, and their first-degree relatives. Interrogation of shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic profiles by using the random forest machine learning algorithm and differential abundance analysis identified discrete metagenomic and metabolomic signatures that were similarly effective in detecting cirrhosis (diagnostic accuracy 0.91, area under curve [AUC]). Combining the metagenomic signature with age and serum albumin levels accurately distinguished cirrhosis in etiologically and genetically distinct cohorts from geographically separated regions. Additional inclusion of serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, which are increased in cirrhosis patients, enabled discrimination of cirrhosis from earlier stages of fibrosis. These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome species might offer universal utility as a non-invasive diagnostic test for cirrhosis.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are critical for continued cellular replacement in the adult brain. Lifelong maintenance of a functional NSPC pool necessitates stringent mechanisms to preserve a pristine proteome. We find that the NSPC chaperone network robustly maintains misfolded protein solubility and stress resilience through high levels of the ATP-dependent chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Strikingly, NSPC differentiation rewires the cellular chaperone network, reducing TRiC/CCT levels and inducing those of the ATP-independent small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins. However, NSPC proteostasis is impaired by brain aging. The less efficient chaperone network of differentiated neural progeny may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are generated from primary transcripts containing multiple clustered stem-loop structures that are thought to be recognized and cleaved by the Microprocessor complex as independent units. Here, we uncover an unexpected mode of processing of the bicistronic miR-15a-16-1 cluster. We find that the primary miR-15a stem-loop is not processed on its own but that the presence of the neighboring primary miR-16-1 stem-loop on the same transcript can compensate for this deficiency in cis. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identify SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) as an essential co-factor in this miR-16-1-assisted pri-miR-15 cleavage and describe SAFB2 as an accessory protein of the Microprocessor. Notably, SAFB2-mediated cleavage expands to other clustered pri-miRNAs, indicating a general mechanism. Together, our study reveals an unrecognized function of SAFB2 in miRNA processing and suggests a scenario in which SAFB2 enables the binding and processing of suboptimal Microprocessor substrates in clustered primary miRNA transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) integrate signals to regulate target gene expression, but we generally lack a quantitative understanding of how changes in TF levels regulate mRNA and protein production. Here, we established a system to simultaneously monitor the levels of p53, a TF that shows oscillations following DNA damage, and the transcription and protein levels of its target p21 in individual cells. p21 transcription tracked p53 dynamics, while p21 protein steadily accumulated. p21 transcriptional activation showed bursts of mRNA production, with p53 levels regulating the probability but not magnitude of activation. Variations in p53 levels between cells contributed to heterogeneous p21 transcription while independent p21 alleles exhibited highly correlated behaviors. Pharmacologically elevating p53 increased the probability of p21 transcription with minor effects on its magnitude, leading to a strong increase in p21 protein levels. Our results reveal quantitative mechanisms by which TF dynamics can regulate protein levels of its targets. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
Nonrandom DNA segregation (NDS) is a mitotic event in which sister chromatids carrying the oldest DNA strands are inherited exclusively by one of the two daughter cells. Although this phenomenon has been observed across various organisms, the mechanism and physiological relevance of this event remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that DNA replication stress can trigger NDS in human cells. This biased inheritance of old template DNA is associated with the asymmetric DNA damage response (DDR), which derives at least in part from telomeric DNA. Mechanistically, we reveal that the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway plays an essential role in mediating NDS. We show that this biased segregation process leads to cell-cycle arrest and cell death in damaged daughter cells inheriting newly replicated DNA. These data therefore identify a key role for NDS in the maintenance of genomic integrity within cancer cell populations undergoing replication stress due to oncogene activation.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables essential metabolic reactions; nonetheless, the cellular responses to defects in mitochondria and the modulation of signaling pathway outputs are not understood. We show that Notch signaling and ETC attenuation via knockdown of COX7a induces massive over-proliferation. The tumor-like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2α-kinase PERK and ATF4, which activates the expression of metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters, and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness, as it renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, over-proliferation is not caused by transcriptional cooperation of Notch and ATF4, but it is mediated in part by pH changes resulting from the Warburg metabolism induced by ETC attenuation. Our results suggest that ETC function is monitored by the PERK-ATF4 pathway, which can be hijacked by growth-promoting signaling pathways, leading to oncogenic pathway activity.

Abstract: Summary
Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that plays an essential role in the maintenance of epigenetic stability in cells. Here, we demonstrate that the conditional deletion of TDG in adult mice results in a male-predominant onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TDG loss leads to a prediabetic state, as well as bile acid (BA) accumulation in the liver and serum of male mice. Consistent with these data, TDG deletion led to dysregulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulatory cascade in the liver. FXR and SHP are tumor suppressors of HCC and play an essential role in BA and glucose homeostasis. These results indicate that TDG functions as a tumor suppressor of HCC by regulating a transcriptional program that protects against the development of glucose intolerance and BA accumulation in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient transporters can be rapidly removed from the cell surface via substrate-stimulated endocytosis as a way to control nutrient influx, but the molecular underpinnings are not well understood. In this work, we focus on zinc-dependent endocytosis of human ZIP4 (hZIP4), a zinc transporter that is essential for dietary zinc uptake. Structure-guided mutagenesis and internalization assay reveal that hZIP4 per se acts as the exclusive zinc sensor, with the transport site’s being responsible for zinc sensing. In an effort of seeking sorting signal, a scan of the longest cytosolic loop (L2) leads to identification of a conserved Leu-Gln-Leu motif that is essential for endocytosis. Partial proteolysis of purified hZIP4 demonstrates a structural coupling between the transport site and the L2 upon zinc binding, which supports a working model of how zinc ions at physiological concentration trigger a conformation-dependent endocytosis of the zinc transporter. This work provides a paradigm on post-translational regulation of nutrient transporters.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelia are active materials where mechanical tension governs morphogenesis and homeostasis. But how that tension is regulated remains incompletely understood. We now report that caveolae control epithelial tension and show that this is necessary for oncogene-transfected cells to be eliminated by apical extrusion. Depletion of caveolin-1 (CAV1) increased steady-state tensile stresses in epithelial monolayers. As a result, loss of CAV1 in the epithelial cells surrounding oncogene-expressing cells prevented their apical extrusion. Epithelial tension in CAV1-depleted monolayers was increased by cortical contractility at adherens junctions. This reflected a signaling pathway, where elevated levels of phosphoinositide-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) recruited the formin, FMNL2, to promote F-actin bundling. Steady-state monolayer tension and oncogenic extrusion were restored to CAV1-depleted monolayers when tension was corrected by depleting FMNL2, blocking PtdIns(4,5)P2, or disabling the interaction between FMNL2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Thus, caveolae can regulate active mechanical tension for epithelial homeostasis by controlling lipid signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic cellular processes such as differentiation are driven by changes in the abundances of transcription factors (TFs). However, despite years of studies, our knowledge about the protein copy number of TFs in the nucleus is limited. Here, by determining the absolute abundances of 103 TFs and co-factors during the course of human erythropoiesis, we provide a dynamic and quantitative scale for TFs in the nucleus. Furthermore, we establish the first gene regulatory network of cell fate commitment that integrates temporal protein stoichiometry data with mRNA measurements. The model revealed quantitative imbalances in TFs’ cross-antagonistic relationships that underlie lineage determination. Finally, we made the surprising discovery that, in the nucleus, co-repressors are dramatically more abundant than co-activators at the protein level, but not at the RNA level, with profound implications for understanding transcriptional regulation. These analyses provide a unique quantitative framework to understand transcriptional regulation of cell differentiation in a dynamic context.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is a process of cellular and tissue dysfunction characterized by different hallmarks, including cellular senescence. However, there is proof that certain features of aging and senescence can be ameliorated. Here, we provide evidence that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from primary fibroblasts of young human donors ameliorate certain biomarkers of senescence in cells derived from old and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome donors. Importantly, sEVs from young cells ameliorate senescence in a variety of tissues in old mice. Mechanistically, we identified sEVs to have intrinsic glutathione-S-transferase activity partially due to the high levels of expression of the glutathione-related protein (GSTM2). Transfection of recombinant GSTM2 into sEVs derived from old fibroblasts restores their antioxidant capacity. sEVs increase the levels of reduced glutathione and decrease oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data provide an indication of the potential of sEVs as regenerative therapy in aging.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a frequently used tool to assess immune cell heterogeneity. Recently, the combined measurement of RNA and protein expression was developed, commonly known as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). Acquisition of protein expression data along with transcriptome data resolves some of the limitations inherent to only assessing transcripts but also nearly doubles the sequencing read depth required per single cell. Furthermore, there is still a paucity of analysis tools to visualize combined transcript-protein datasets. Here, we describe a targeted transcriptomics approach that combines an analysis of over 400 genes with simultaneous measurement of over 40 proteins on 2 × 104 cells in a single experiment. This targeted approach requires only about one-tenth of the read depth compared to a whole-transcriptome approach while retaining high sensitivity for low abundance transcripts. To analyze these multi-omic datasets, we adapted one-dimensional soli expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding (One-SENSE) for intuitive visualization of protein-transcript relationships on a single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is overexpressed in several types of cancer, suggesting an additional function beyond its established role in the glycolytic pathway. We here report that PGAM1 is overexpressed in gliomas where it increases the efficiency of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by cytoplasmic binding of WIP1 phosphatase, thereby preventing WIP1 nuclear translocation and subsequent dephosphorylation of the ATM signaling pathway. Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ. These effects are counteracted by exogenous expression of two kinase-dead PGAM1 mutants, H186R and Y92F, indicating an important non-enzymatic function of PGAM1. Our findings identify PGAM1 as a potential therapeutic target in gliomas.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, alters RNA sequences from those encoded by DNA. These editing events are dynamically regulated, but few trans regulators of ADARs are known in vivo. Here, we screen RNA-binding proteins for roles in editing regulation with knockdown experiments in the Drosophila brain. We identify zinc-finger protein at 72D (Zn72D) as a regulator of editing levels at a majority of editing sites in the brain. Zn72D both regulates ADAR protein levels and interacts with ADAR in an RNA-dependent fashion, and similar to ADAR, Zn72D is necessary to maintain proper neuromuscular junction architecture and fly mobility. Furthermore, Zn72D’s regulatory role in RNA editing is conserved because the mammalian homolog of Zn72D, Zfr, regulates editing in mouse primary neurons. The broad and conserved regulation of ADAR editing by Zn72D in neurons sustains critically important editing events.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an RNA modification well-known for its contribution to different processes controlling RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, and translation of mRNA. Conversely, the role of m6A on the biogenesis and function of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has yet to be addressed. circRNAs belong to a class of covalently closed transcripts produced via a back-splicing reaction whereby a downstream 5′ splice donor site fuses to an upstream 3′ splice acceptor site. Starting from circ-ZNF609 as a study case, we discover that specific m6As control its accumulation and that METTL3 and YTHDC1 are required to direct the back-splicing reaction. This feature is shared with other circRNAs because we find a significant direct correlation among METTL3 requirement, YTHDC1 binding, and the ability of m6A exons to undergo back-splicing. Finally, because circ-ZNF609 displays the ability to be translated, we show that m6A modifications, through recognition by YTHDF3 and eIF4G2, modulate its translation.

Abstract: Summary
Connectivity webs mediate the unique biology of the mammalian brain. Yet, while cell circuit maps are increasingly available, knowledge of their underlying molecular networks remains limited. Here, we applied multi-dimensional biochemical fractionation with mass spectrometry and machine learning to survey endogenous macromolecules across the adult mouse brain. We defined a global “interactome” comprising over one thousand multi-protein complexes. These include hundreds of brain-selective assemblies that have distinct physical and functional attributes, show regional and cell-type specificity, and have links to core neurological processes and disorders. Using reciprocal pull-downs and a transgenic model, we validated a putative 28-member RNA-binding protein complex associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a coordinated function in alternative splicing in disease progression. This brain interaction map (BraInMap) resource facilitates mechanistic exploration of the unique molecular machinery driving core cellular processes of the central nervous system. It is publicly available and can be explored here https://www.bu.edu/dbin/cnsb/mousebrain/.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-obesity drugs in the amphetamine (AMPH) class act in the brain to reduce appetite and increase locomotion. They are also characterized by adverse cardiovascular effects with origin that, despite absence of any in vivo evidence, is attributed to a direct sympathomimetic action in the heart. Here, we show that the cardiac side effects of AMPH originate from the brain and can be circumvented by PEGylation (PEGyAMPH) to exclude its central action. PEGyAMPH does not enter the brain and facilitates SNS activity via theβ2-adrenoceptor, protecting mice against obesity by increasing lipolysis and thermogenesis, coupled to higher heat dissipation, which acts as an energy sink to increase energy expenditure without altering food intake or locomotor activity. Thus, we provide proof-of-principle for a novel class of exclusively peripheral anti-obesity sympathofacilitators that are devoid of any cardiovascular and brain-related side effects.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive targeted therapy resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are poorly understood. Here, we identify SETD5 as a major driver of PDAC resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi). SETD5 is induced by MEKi resistance and its deletion restores refractory PDAC vulnerability to MEKi therapy in mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. SETD5 lacks histone methyltransferase activity but scaffolds a co-repressor complex, including HDAC3 and G9a. Gene silencing by the SETD5 complex regulates known drug resistance pathways to reprogram cellular responses to MEKi. Pharmacological co-targeting of MEK1/2, HDAC3, and G9a sustains PDAC tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Our work uncovers SETD5 as a key mediator of acquired MEKi therapy resistance in PDAC and suggests a context for advancing MEKi use in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can be divided into transcriptomic subtypes with two broad lineages referred to as classical (pancreatic) and squamous. We find that these two subtypes are driven by distinct metabolic phenotypes. Loss of genes that drive endodermal lineage specification, HNF4A and GATA6, switch metabolic profiles from classical (pancreatic) to predominantly squamous, with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) a key regulator of glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β results in selective sensitivity in the squamous subtype; however, a subset of these squamous patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs) acquires rapid drug tolerance. Using chromatin accessibility maps, we demonstrate that the squamous subtype can be further classified using chromatin accessibility to predict responsiveness and tolerance to GSK3β inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility can be used to identify patient subgroups that are indistinguishable by gene expression profiles, highlighting the utility of chromatin-based biomarkers for patient selection in the treatment of PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
B cell receptor (BCR) engagement induces naive B cells to differentiate and perform critical immune-regulatory functions. Acquisition of functional specificity requires that a cell survive, enter the cell cycle, and proliferate. We establish that quantitatively distinct Ca2+ signals triggered by variations in the extent of BCR engagement dynamically regulate these transitions by controlling nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NFAT, and mTORC1 activity. Weak BCR engagement induces apoptosis by failing to activate NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene expression. Stronger signals that trigger more robust Ca2+ signals promote NF-κB-dependent survival and NFAT-, mTORC1-, and c-Myc-dependent cell-cycle entry and proliferation. Finally, we establish that CD40 or TLR9 costimulation circumvents these Ca2+-regulated checkpoints of B cell activation and proliferation. As altered BCR signaling is linked to autoimmunity and B cell malignancies, these results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of aberrant B cell activation and differentiation and therapeutic approaches to target these responses.

Abstract: Summary
The eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) serve critical modulatory roles throughout the nervous system. The molecular diversity of mGluRs is thought to be further expanded by the formation of heterodimers, but the co-expression of mGluR subtypes at the cellular level and the relative propensities of heterodimer formation are not well known. Here, we analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data and find that cortical pyramidal cells express multiple mGluR subtypes with distinct profiles for different receptor combinations. We then develop quantitative, fluorescence-based assays to define the relative homo- and heterodimer propensities across group-I, -II, and -III mGluRs. We find a strong preference for heterodimerization in a number of cases, including mGluR2 with mGluR3, which we confirm in frontal cortex using in situ RNA hybridization and co-immunoprecipitation. Together, our findings support the biological relevance of mGluR heterodimerization and highlight the complex landscape of mGluR populations in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control targeting the initiation phase is central to the regulation of gene expression. Understanding all of its aspects requires substantial technological advancements. Here we modified yeast translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adapted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ss) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ss), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ss distribute similarly across 5′TRs, indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed yeast and human selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq), enabling selection of 40Ss and 80Ss associated with immuno-targeted factors. Sel-TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5′ UTRs with scanning 40Ss to successively dissociate upon AUG recognition; notably, a proportion of eIF3 lingers on during the initial elongation cycles. Highlighting Sel-TCP-seq versatility, we also identified four initiating 48S conformational intermediates, provided novel insights into ATF4 and GCN4 mRNA translational control, and demonstrated co-translational assembly of initiation factor complexes.

Abstract: Objectives
The search for new TB drugs has become one of the great challenges for modern medicinal chemistry. An improvement in the outcomes of TB chemotherapy can be achieved by the development of new, shorter, cheap, safe and effective anti-TB regimens.
Methods
Chalcones (1a-1o) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium bovis BCG using growth inhibition assays. Compound 1a was selected as a ‘hit’ compound. The mode of action of compound 1a, was identified by mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) analysis using thin layer chromatography. Dose dependent experiments were conducted by over-expressing components of FAS-II in M. bovis BCG to confirm the target. Ligand binding using intrinsic tryptophan assay and molecular docking were used to further validate the target.
Results
MAMEs and FAMEs analysis showed dose-dependent reduction of MAMEs with the overall abundance of FAMEs suggesting that compound 1a targets mycolic acid biosynthesis. Direct binding of 1a to InhA was observed using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence binding assay, and a 2-fold IC50 shift was observed with an InhA overexpressing strain confirming InhA as the cellular target.
Conclusion
The chalcone 1a exhibits potent antimycobacterial activity, displays a good safety profile and is a direct inhibitor of InhA, a key component in mycolic acid synthesis, validating this series for further anti-TB drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Many proteins that are needed for progression through S-phase are produced from transcripts that peak in the S-phase, linking temporal expression of those proteins to the time that they are required in cell cycle. Here, we explore the potential roles of long non-coding RNAs in cell cycle progression. We use a sensitive click-chemistry approach to isolate nascent RNAs in a human cell line, and we identify more than 900 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) whose synthesis peaks during the S-phase. More than 200 of these are long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) with S-phase-specific expression. We characterize three of these lincRNAs by knockdown and find that all three lincRNAs are required for appropriate S-phase progression. We infer that non-coding RNAs are key regulatory effectors during the cell cycle, acting on distinct regulatory networks, and herein, we provide a large catalog of candidate cell-cycle regulatory RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity and heterogeneity within high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), which is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is not well understood. Here, we perform comprehensive multi-platform omics analyses, including integrated analysis, and immune monitoring on primary and metastatic sites from highly clinically annotated HGSC samples based on a laparoscopic triage algorithm from patients who underwent complete gross resection (R0) or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with excellent or poor response. We identify significant distinct molecular abnormalities and cellular changes and immune cell repertoire alterations between the groups, including a higher rate of NF1 copy number loss, and reduced chromothripsis-like patterns, higher levels of strong-binding neoantigens, and a higher number of infiltrated T cells in the R0 versus the NACT groups.
