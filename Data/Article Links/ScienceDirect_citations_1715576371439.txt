Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are key therapeutic agents in the management of metastatic hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. However, the emergence of drug resistance limits their long-term efficacy. Here, we show that breast cancer cells develop CDK4/6i resistance via a sequential two-step process of E2F activation. This process entails retinoblastoma (Rb)-protein degradation, followed by c-Myc-mediated amplification of E2F transcriptional activity. CDK4/6i treatment halts cell proliferation in an Rb-dependent manner but dramatically reduces Rb-protein levels. However, this reduction in Rb levels insufficiently induces E2F activity. To develop CDK4/6i resistance, upregulation or activating mutations in mitogenic or hormone signaling are required to stabilize c-Myc levels, thereby augmenting E2F activity. Our analysis of pre-treatment tumor samples reveals a strong correlation between c-Myc levels, rather than Rb levels, and poor therapeutic outcomes after CDK4/6i treatment. Moreover, we propose that proteasome inhibitors can potentially reverse CDK4/6i resistance by restoring Rb levels.

Abstract: Summary
Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells mediate pathogen clearance. T cell phenotype is influenced by T cell receptor (TCR) sequences and environmental signals. Quantitative comparisons of these factors in human disease, while challenging to obtain, can provide foundational insights into basic T cell biology. Here, we investigate the phenotype kinetics of 679 CD8+ T cell clonotypes, each with specificity against one of three immunogenic viral antigens. Data were collected from a longitudinal study of 68 COVID-19 patients with antigens from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and influenza. Each antigen is associated with a different type of immune activation during COVID-19. We find TCR sequence to be by far the most important factor in shaping T cell phenotype and persistence for populations specific to any of these antigens. Our work demonstrates the important relationship between TCR sequence and T cell phenotype and persistence and helps explain why T cell phenotype often appears to be determined early in an infection.

Abstract: Summary
TRAF1/C5 was among the first loci shown to confer risk for inflammatory arthritis in the absence of an associated coding variant, but its genetic mechanism remains undefined. Using Immunochip data from 3,939 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 14,412 control individuals, we identified 132 plausible common non-coding variants, reduced serially by single-nucleotide polymorphism sequencing (SNP-seq), electrophoretic mobility shift, and luciferase studies to the single variant rs7034653 in the third intron of TRAF1. Genetically manipulated experimental cells and primary monocytes from genotyped donors establish that the risk G allele reduces binding of Fos-related antigen 2 (FRA2), encoded by FOSL2, resulting in reduced TRAF1 expression and enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Conditioning on this JIA variant eliminated attributable risk for rheumatoid arthritis, implicating a mechanism shared across the arthritis spectrum. These findings reveal that rs7034653, FRA2, and TRAF1 mediate a pathway through which a non-coding functional variant drives risk of inflammatory arthritis in children and adults.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acids have long been considered essential to brain development; however, the involvement of their synthesis in nervous system formation is unclear. We generate mice with knockout of GPSN2, an enzyme for synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and investigate the effects. Both GPSN2−/− and GPSN2+/− mice show abnormal neuronal networks as a result of impaired neuronal polarity determination. Lipidomics of GPSN2−/− embryos reveal that ceramide synthesis is specifically inhibited depending on FA length; namely, VLCFA-containing ceramide is reduced. We demonstrate that lipid rafts are highly enriched in growth cones and that GPSN2+/− neurons lose gangliosides in their membranes. Application of C24:0 ceramide, but not C16:0 ceramide or C24:0 phosphatidylcholine, to GPSN2+/− neurons rescues both neuronal polarity determination and lipid-raft density in the growth cone. Taken together, our results indicate that VLCFA synthesis contributes to physiological neuronal development in brain network formation, in particular neuronal polarity determination through the formation of lipid rafts.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is an important driver of Tau pathology, gliosis, and degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Still, the mechanisms underlying these APOE4-driven pathological effects remain elusive. Here, we report in a tauopathy mouse model that APOE4 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic translocation and release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from hippocampal neurons, which correlated with the severity of hippocampal microgliosis and degeneration. Injection of HMGB1 into the hippocampus of young APOE4-tauopathy mice induced considerable and persistent gliosis. Selective removal of neuronal APOE4 reduced HMGB1 translocation and release. Treatment of APOE4-tauopathy mice with HMGB1 inhibitors effectively blocked the intraneuronal translocation and release of HMGB1 and ameliorated the development of APOE4-driven gliosis, Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with HMGB1 inhibitors diminished disease-associated and enriched disease-protective subpopulations of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in APOE4-tauopathy mice. Thus, HMGB1 inhibitors represent a promising approach for treating APOE4-related AD.

Abstract: Summary
The enhanced response of glucagon and its Drosophila homolog, adipokinetic hormone (Akh), leads to high-caloric-diet-induced hyperglycemia across species. While previous studies have characterized regulatory components transducing linear Akh signaling promoting carbohydrate production, the spatial elucidation of Akh action at the organelle level still remains largely unclear. In this study, we find that Akh phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and translocates it to peroxisome via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) cascade to increase carbohydrate production in the fat body, leading to hyperglycemia. The mechanisms include that ERK mediates fat body peroxisomal conversion of amino acids into carbohydrates for gluconeogenesis in response to Akh. Importantly, Akh receptor (AkhR) or ERK deficiency, importin-associated ERK retention from peroxisome, or peroxisome inactivation in the fat body sufficiently alleviates high-sugar-diet-induced hyperglycemia. We also observe mammalian glucagon-induced hepatic ERK peroxisomal translocation in diabetic subjects. Therefore, our results conclude that the Akh/glucagon-peroxisomal-ERK axis is a key spatial regulator of glycemic control.

Abstract: Molossus molossus is an insectivorous molossid bat that is important in the control of nocturnal insects. It is the nominal and the most representative species of the family. However, there are few studies about its reproduction. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate variations of its female reproductive organs during the different reproductive phases. Twenty adult females, divided into four sample groups (non-reproductive, early and advanced pregnancy and lactation), were submitted to morphological and morphometric analyses. Results show that the female reproductive system of M. molossus is composed of ovaries, a short bicornuate uterus, slightly convoluted uterine tubes and vagina. The system presents a distinct morphofunctional asymmetry, with a marked dextro-dominance. The right ovaries of all analyzed groups (NON, P1, P2, and LAC) showed follicles at different stages of development, a large number of interstitial glands and a small, but persistent corpus luteum. Ovulation is simple, unilateral and preferential, occurring exclusively in the right ovary. Follicular development in the left ovary usually does not pass the secondary stage. Implantation is fundic and preferential, occurring exclusively in the right uterine horn. The placenta is formed with two distinct chorioallantoic portions, one diffuse endotheliochorial, which covers the entire uterine cavity and regresses in the final stages of pregnancy, and the principal discoidal hemochorial portion, formed in the implantation site. The uterine cervix presents a pseudostratified epithelium, while the vagina has a little keratinized stratified epithelium, which does not accentually vary in the different reproductive stages, but can disrupt and shed in some cases.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pyogenes is an obligate human pathobiont associated with many disease states. Here, we present a model of S. pyogenes infection using intact murine epithelium. We were able to perform RNA sequencing to evaluate genetic changes undertaken by both the bacterium and host at 5 and 24 h post-infection. Analysis of these genomic data demonstrate that S. pyogenes undergoes genetic adaptation to successfully infect the murine epithelium, including changes to metabolism and activation of the Rgg2/Rgg3 quorum-sensing (QS) system. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that an intact Rgg2/Rgg3 QS cascade is necessary to establish a stable superficial skin infection. QS cascade activation results in increased murine morbidity and bacterial burden on the skin. This phenotype is associated with gross changes to the murine skin and with evidence of inflammation. These experiments offer a method to investigate S. pyogenes-epithelial interactions and demonstrate that a well-studied QS pathway is critical to a persistent infection.

Abstract: Summary
The fungal pathogen Candida albicans is linked to chronic brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the molecular basis of brain anti-Candida immunity remains unknown. We show that C. albicans enters the mouse brain from the blood and induces two neuroimmune sensing mechanisms involving secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) and candidalysin. Saps disrupt tight junction proteins of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to permit fungal brain invasion. Saps also hydrolyze amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid β (Aβ)-like peptides that bind to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and promote fungal killing in vitro while candidalysin engages the integrin CD11b (Mac-1) on microglia. Recognition of Aβ-like peptides and candidalysin promotes fungal clearance from the brain, and disruption of candidalysin recognition through CD11b markedly prolongs C. albicans cerebral mycosis. Thus, C. albicans is cleared from the brain through innate immune mechanisms involving Saps, Aβ, candidalysin, and CD11b.

Abstract: Summary
Although distinct epithelial cell types have been distinguished in glandular tissues such as the mammary gland, the extent of heterogeneity within each cell type and the degree of endocrine control of this diversity across development are incompletely understood. By combining mass cytometry and cyclic immunofluorescence, we define a rich array of murine mammary epithelial cell subtypes associated with puberty, the estrous cycle, and sex. These subtypes are differentially proliferative and spatially segregate distinctly in adult versus pubescent glands. Further, we identify systematic suppression of lineage programs at the protein and RNA levels as a common feature of mammary epithelial expansion during puberty, the estrous cycle, and gestation and uncover a pervasive enrichment of ribosomal protein genes in luminal cells elicited specifically during progesterone-dominant expansionary periods. Collectively, these data expand our knowledge of murine mammary epithelial heterogeneity and connect endocrine-driven epithelial expansion with lineage suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy is crucial to regulate the function and homeostasis of the ER via lysosomal degradation, but how it is initiated is unclear. Here we discover that Z-AAT, a disease-causing mutant of α1-antitrypsin, induces noncanonical ER-phagy at ER exit sites (ERESs). Accumulation of misfolded Z-AAT at the ERESs impairs coat protein complex II (COPII)-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport and retains V0 subunits that further assemble V-ATPase at the arrested ERESs. V-ATPase subsequently recruits ATG16L1 onto ERESs to mediate in situ lipidation of LC3C. FAM134B-II is then recruited by LC3C via its LIR motif and elicits ER-phagy leading to efficient lysosomal degradation of Z-AAT. Activation of this ER-phagy mediated by the V-ATPase-ATG16L1-LC3C axis (EVAC) is also triggered by blocking ER export. Our findings identify a pathway which switches COPII-mediated transport to lysosomal degradation for ER quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Increased nucleolar size and activity correlate with aberrant ribosome biogenesis and enhanced translation in cancer cells. One of the first and rate-limiting steps in translation is the interaction of the 40S small ribosome subunit with mRNAs. Here, we report the identification of the zinc finger protein 692 (ZNF692), a MYC-induced nucleolar scaffold that coordinates the final steps in the biogenesis of the small ribosome subunit. ZNF692 forms a hub containing the exosome complex and ribosome biogenesis factors specialized in the final steps of 18S rRNA processing and 40S ribosome maturation in the granular component of the nucleolus. Highly proliferative cells are more reliant on ZNF692 than normal cells; thus, we conclude that effective production of small ribosome subunits is critical for translation efficiency in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Chaperonin Containing Tailless polypeptide 1 (CCT) complex is an essential protein folding machine with a diverse clientele of substrates, including many proteins with β-propeller domains. Here, we determine the structures of human CCT in complex with its accessory co-chaperone, phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP1), in the process of folding Gβ5, a component of Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) complexes. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image processing reveal an ensemble of distinct snapshots that represent the folding trajectory of Gβ5 from an unfolded molten globule to a fully folded β-propeller. These structures reveal the mechanism by which CCT directs Gβ5 folding through initiating specific intermolecular contacts that facilitate the sequential folding of individual β sheets until the propeller closes into its native structure. This work directly visualizes chaperone-mediated protein folding and establishes that CCT orchestrates folding by stabilizing intermediates through interactions with surface residues that permit the hydrophobic core to coalesce into its folded state.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a pre-malignant condition of the gastric mucosa associated with increased gastric cancer (GC) risk. Analyzing 1,256 gastric samples (1,152 IMs) across 692 subjects from a prospective 10-year study, we identify 26 IM driver genes in diverse pathways including chromatin regulation (ARID1A) and intestinal homeostasis (SOX9). Single-cell and spatial profiles highlight changes in tissue ecology and IM lineage heterogeneity, including an intestinal stem-cell dominant cellular compartment linked to early malignancy. Expanded transcriptome profiling reveals expression-based molecular subtypes of IM associated with incomplete histology, antral/intestinal cell types, ARID1A mutations, inflammation, and microbial communities normally associated with the healthy oral tract. We demonstrate that combined clinical-genomic models outperform clinical-only models in predicting IMs likely to transform to GC. By highlighting strategies for accurately identifying IM patients at high GC risk and a role for microbial dysbiosis in IM progression, our results raise opportunities for GC precision prevention and interception.

Abstract: Summary
Sensing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA is mediated by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling axis. Signal transduction and regulation of this cascade is achieved by post-translational modifications. Here we show that cGAS-STING-dependent HIV-1 sensing requires interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). ISG15 deficiency inhibits STING-dependent sensing of HIV-1 and STING agonist-induced antiviral response. Upon external stimuli, STING undergoes ISGylation at residues K224, K236, K289, K347, K338, and K370. Inhibition of STING ISGylation at K289 suppresses STING-mediated type Ⅰ interferon induction by inhibiting its oligomerization. Of note, removal of STING ISGylation alleviates gain-of-function phenotype in STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Molecular modeling suggests that ISGylation of K289 is an important regulator of oligomerization. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ISGylation at K289 is crucial for STING activation and represents an important regulatory step in DNA sensing of viruses and autoimmune responses.

Abstract: Summary
The miR-15/16 family targets a large network of genes in T cells to restrict their cell cycle, memory formation, and survival. Upon T cell activation, miR-15/16 are downregulated, allowing rapid expansion of differentiated effector T cells to mediate a sustained response. Here, we used conditional deletion of miR-15/16 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) to identify immune functions of the miR-15/16 family in T cells. miR-15/16 are indispensable to maintain peripheral tolerance by securing efficient suppression by a limited number of Tregs. miR-15/16 deficiency alters expression of critical Treg proteins and results in accumulation of functionally impaired FOXP3loCD25loCD127hi Tregs. Excessive proliferation in the absence of miR-15/16 shifts Treg fate and produces an effector Treg phenotype. These Tregs fail to control immune activation, leading to spontaneous multi-organ inflammation and increased allergic inflammation in a mouse model of asthma. Together, our results demonstrate that miR-15/16 expression in Tregs is essential to maintain immune tolerance.

The resulting increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis suppresses glycolysis and increases the utilization of pyruvate and/or alternative respiratory substrates. The ability of lactate to increase oxidative phosphorylation does not depend on its metabolism. Both L- and D-lactate are effective at enhancing ETC activity and suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the selective induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by unmetabolized D-lactate reversibly suppressed aerobic glycolysis in both cancer cell lines and proliferating primary cells in an ATP-dependent manner and enabled cell growth on respiratory-dependent bioenergetic substrates. In primary T cells, D-lactate enhanced cell proliferation and effector function. Together, these findings demonstrate that lactate is a critical regulator of the ability of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to suppress glucose fermentation.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrosis, characterized by sustained activation of myofibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, is known to be associated with chronic inflammation. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), the central kinase of necroptosis signaling, is upregulated in fibrosis and contributes to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated inflammation. In bile-duct-ligation-induced liver fibrosis, we found that myofibroblasts are the major cell type expressing RIPK3. Genetic ablation of β1 integrin, the major profibrotic ECM receptor in fibroblasts, not only abolished ECM fibrillogenesis but also blunted RIPK3 expression via a mechanism mediated by the chromatin-remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4). While the function of CHD4 has been conventionally linked to the nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) and CHD4-ADNP-HP1(ChAHP) complexes, we found that CHD4 potently repressed a set of genes, including Ripk3, with high locus specificity but independent of either the NuRD or the ChAHP complex. Thus, our data uncover that β1 integrin intrinsically links fibrotic signaling to RIPK3-driven inflammation via a novel mode of action of CHD4.

Abstract: Summary
Purinosomes serve as metabolons to enhance de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) efficiency through compartmentalizing DNPS enzymes during stressed conditions. However, the mechanism underpinning purinosome assembly and its pathophysiological functions remains elusive. Here, we show that K6-polyubiquitination of the DNPS enzyme phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS) by cullin-5/ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 11 (Cul5/ASB11)-based ubiquitin ligase plays a driving role in purinosome assembly. Upon several purinosome-inducing cues, ASB11 is upregulated by relieving the H3K9me3/HP1α-mediated transcriptional silencing, thus stimulating PAICS polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitinated PAICS recruits ubiquitin-associated protein 2 (UBAP2), a ubiquitin-binding protein with multiple stretches of intrinsically disordered regions, thereby inducing phase separation to trigger purinosome assembly for enhancing DNPS pathway flux. In human melanoma, ASB11 is highly expressed to facilitate a constitutive purinosome formation to which melanoma cells are addicted for supporting their proliferation, viability, and tumorigenesis in a xenograft model. Our study identifies a driving mechanism for purinosome assembly in response to cellular stresses and uncovers the impact of purinosome formation on human malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine succinylation is a subtype of protein acylation associated with metabolic regulation of succinyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Deficiency of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme catalyzing the interconversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, results in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in humans. This report presents a conditional forebrain-specific knockout (KO) mouse model of Sucla2, the gene encoding the ATP-specific beta isoform of SCS, resulting in postnatal deficiency of the entire SCS complex. Results demonstrate that accumulation of succinyl-CoA in the absence of SCS leads to hypersuccinylation within the murine cerebral cortex. Specifically, increased succinylation is associated with functionally significant reduced activity of respiratory chain complex I and widescale alterations in chromatin landscape and gene expression. Integrative analysis of the transcriptomic data also reveals perturbations in regulatory networks of neuronal transcription in the KO forebrain. Together, these findings provide evidence that protein succinylation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SCS deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis causes breast cancer-related mortality. Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) inflict immunosuppression and promote metastasis. Therapeutic debilitation of TINs may enhance immunotherapy, yet it remains a challenge to identify therapeutic targets highly expressed and functionally essential in TINs but under-expressed in extra-tumoral neutrophils. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing to compare TINs and circulating neutrophils in murine mammary tumor models, we identified aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1) as the most upregulated metabolic enzyme in mouse TINs and validated high Acod1 expression in human TINs. Activated through the GM-CSF-JAK/STAT5-C/EBPβ pathway, Acod1 produces itaconate, which mediates Nrf2-dependent defense against ferroptosis and upholds the persistence of TINs. Acod1 ablation abates TIN infiltration, constrains metastasis (but not primary tumors), bolsters antitumor T cell immunity, and boosts the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings reveal how TINs escape from ferroptosis through the Acod1-dependent immunometabolism switch and establish Acod1 as a target to offset immunosuppression and improve immunotherapy against metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Bordetella spp. are respiratory pathogens equipped with immune evasion mechanisms. We previously characterized a Bordetella bronchiseptica mutant (RB50ΔbtrS) that fails to suppress host responses, leading to rapid clearance and long-lasting immunity against reinfection. This work revealed eosinophils as an exclusive requirement for RB50ΔbtrS clearance. We also show that RB50ΔbtrS promotes eosinophil-mediated B/T cell recruitment and inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) formation, with eosinophils being present throughout iBALT for Th17 and immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Finally, we provide evidence that XCL1 is critical for iBALT formation but not maintenance, proposing a novel role for eosinophils as facilitators of adaptive immunity against B. bronchiseptica. RB50ΔbtrS being incapable of suppressing eosinophil effector functions illuminates active, bacterial targeting of eosinophils to achieve successful persistence and reinfection. Overall, our discoveries contribute to understanding cellular mechanisms for use in future vaccines and therapies against Bordetella spp. and extension to other mucosal pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be bred in captivity, is an emerging model organism for aging research. Here, we describe a multitissue, single-cell gene expression atlas of female and male blood, kidney, liver, and spleen. We annotate 22 cell types, define marker genes, and infer differentiation trajectories. We find pervasive sex-dimorphic gene expression across cell types. Sex-dimorphic genes tend to be linked to lipid metabolism, consistent with clear differences in lipid storage in female vs. male turquoise killifish livers. We use machine learning to predict sex using single-cell gene expression and identify potential markers for molecular sex identity. As a proof of principle, we show that our atlas can be used to deconvolute existing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to obtain accurate estimates of cell type proportions. This atlas can be a resource to the community that could be leveraged to develop cell-type-specific expression in transgenic animals.

Abstract: Accumulation of pathogenic amyloid-β disrupts the tight junction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), one of its senescence-like structural alterations. In the clearance of amyloid-β, the autophagy-lysosome pathway plays the crucial role. In this context, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibits the process of autophagy and lysosomal degradation, acting as a potential therapeutic target for age-associated disorders. However, efficacy of targeting mTOR to treat age-related macular degeneration remains largely elusive. Here, we validated the therapeutic efficacy of the mTOR inhibitors, Torin and PP242, in clearing amyloid-β by inducing the autophagy-lysosome pathway in a mouse model with pathogenic amyloid-β with tight junction disruption of RPE, which is evident in dry age-related macular degeneration. High concentration of amyloid-β oligomers induced autophagy-lysosome pathway impairment accompanied by the accumulation of p62 and decreased lysosomal activity in RPE cells. However, Torin and PP242 treatment restored the lysosomal activity via activation of LAMP2 and facilitated the clearance of amyloid-β in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clearance of amyloid-β by Torin and PP242 ameliorated the tight junction disruption of RPE in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest mTOR inhibition as a new therapeutic strategy for the restoration of tight junctions in age-related macular degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Overeating disorders (ODs), usually stemming from dieting history and stress, remain a pervasive issue in contemporary society, with the pathological mechanisms largely unresolved. Here, we show that alterations in intestinal microbiota are responsible for the excessive intake of palatable foods in OD mice and patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). Stress combined with a history of dieting causes significant changes in the microbiota and the intestinal metabolism, which disinhibit the vagus nerve terminals in the gut and thereby lead to a subsequent hyperactivation of the gut-brain axis passing through the vagus, the solitary tract nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. The transplantation of a probiotic Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or dietary supplement of key metabolites restores the activity of the gut-to-brain pathway and thereby alleviates the OD symptoms. Thus, our study delineates how the microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates energy balance, unveils the underlying pathogenesis of the OD, and provides potential therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Multipotent Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have vigorous immunomodulatory activity, apoptotic effects, and the capacity to migrate to inflammatory and tumor sites. This study focuses on the apoptotic effects of MSCs conditioned medium (CM) on colorectal cancer cell lines. MSCs were preconditioned with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The conditioned medium (LPS-CM) from the preconditioned cells was isolated and used to treat colorectal cancer cells (HT29 and SW48). The survival and proliferation of cancer cells were assessed using Trypan blue staining and MTT assay. The apoptosis rate was evaluated through flow cytometry analysis and caspase-3 activity. Additionally, Real-Time PCR was used to measure the mRNA level of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors, including bcl2, bax, and p53 genes. The results showed that LPS-CM significantly increased (p < 0.001) the percentage of apoptosis in the SW48 and HT29 cell lines. Caspase-3 activity significantly increased (p < 0.001) in these cell lines after treatment with LPS-CM. The mRNA level of bcl2 was significantly decreased (p < 0.001), while bax and p53 genes were significantly overexpressed (p < 0.001) in the LPS-CM treated cell lines. Notably, the mRNA level of bcl2 and bax genes was significantly altered at a higher concentration of LPS-CM. In conclusion, the conditioned medium from LPS-preconditioned MSCs can effectively induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. This finding suggests that LPS-CM could be a potential strategy for inhibiting the proliferation and progression of colorectal cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism is regulated by complex interplay between the scavenger receptor group B type 1 (SR-BI) and multiple signaling molecules in the liver. Here, we show that lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) is a key regulator of hepatic SR-BI, HDL metabolism, and atherosclerosis. Overexpression of human Lcn2 in hepatocytes attenuates the development of atherosclerosis via SR-BI in western-diet-fed Ldlr−/− mice, whereas hepatocyte-specific ablation of Lcn2 has the opposite effect. Mechanistically, hepatocyte Lcn2 improves HDL metabolism and alleviates atherogenesis by blocking Nedd4-1-mediated SR-BI ubiquitination at K500 and K508. The Lcn2-improved HDL metabolism is abolished in mice with hepatocyte-specific Nedd4-1 or SR-BI deletion and in SR-BI (K500A/K508A) mutation mice. This study identifies a regulatory axis from Lcn2 to HDL via blocking Nedd4-1-mediated SR-BI ubiquitination and demonstrates that hepatocyte Lcn2 may be a promising target to improve HDL metabolism to treat atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the leading cause of high ovarian-cancer-related mortality worldwide. Three major processes constitute the whole metastatic cascade: invasion, intravasation, and extravasation. Tumor cells often reprogram their metabolism to gain advantages in proliferation and survival. However, whether and how those metabolic alterations contribute to the invasiveness of tumor cells has yet to be fully understood. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify genes participating in tumor cell dissemination and revealed that PTGES3 acts as an invasion suppressor in ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, PTGES3 binds to phosphofructokinase, liver type (PFKL) and generates a local source of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to allosterically inhibit the enzymatic activity of PFKL. Repressed PFKL leads to downgraded glycolysis and the subsequent TCA cycle for glucose metabolism. However, ovarian cancer suppresses the expression of PTGES3 and disrupts the PTGES3-PGE2-PFKL inhibitory axis, leading to hyperactivation of glucose oxidation, eventually facilitating ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer evades host immune surveillance by virtue of poor immunogenicity. Here, we report an immune suppressor, designated as PTIR1, that acts as a promotor of tumor immune resistance. PTIR1 is selectively induced in human cancers via alternative splicing of DDX58 (RIG-I), and its induction is closely related to poor outcome in patients with cancer. Through blocking the recruitment of leukocytes, PTIR1 facilitates cancer immune escape and tumor-intrinsic resistance to immunotherapeutic treatments. Unlike RIG-I, PTIR1 is capable of binding to the C terminus of UCHL5 and activates its ubiquitinating function, which in turn inhibits immunoproteasome activity and limits neoantigen processing and presentation, consequently blocking T cell recognition and attack against cancer. Moreover, we find that the adenosine deaminase ADAR1 induces A-to-I RNA editing on DDX58 transcript, thus triggering PTIR1 production. Collectively, our data uncover the immunosuppressive role of PTIR1 in tumorigenesis and propose that ADAR1-PTIR1-UCHL5 signaling is a potential cancer immunotherapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Time and space are primary dimensions of human experience. Separate lines of investigation have identified neural correlates of time and space, yet little is known about how these representations converge during self-guided experience. Here, 10 subjects with intracranially implanted microelectrodes play a timed, virtual navigation game featuring object search and retrieval tasks separated by fixed delays. Time cells and place cells activate in parallel during timed navigation intervals, whereas a separate time cell sequence spans inter-task delays. The prevalence, firing rates, and behavioral coding strengths of time cells and place cells are indistinguishable—yet time cells selectively remap between search and retrieval tasks, while place cell responses remain stable. Thus, the brain can represent time and space as overlapping but dissociable dimensions. Time cells and place cells may constitute a biological basis for the cognitive map of spatiotemporal context onto which memories are written.

Abstract: Summary
Nociceptive axons undergo remodeling as they innervate their targets during development and in response to environmental insults and pathological conditions. How is nociceptive morphogenesis regulated? Here, we show that the microtubule destabilizer kinesin family member 2A (Kif2a) is a key regulator of nociceptive terminal structures and pain sensitivity. Ablation of Kif2a in sensory neurons causes hyperinnervation and hypersensitivity to noxious stimuli in young adult mice, whereas touch sensitivity and proprioception remain unaffected. Computational modeling predicts that structural remodeling is sufficient to explain the phenotypes. Furthermore, Kif2a deficiency triggers a transcriptional response comprising sustained upregulation of injury-related genes and homeostatic downregulation of highly specific channels and receptors at the late stage. The latter effect can be predicted to relieve the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, despite persisting morphological aberrations, and indeed correlates with the resolution of pain hypersensitivity. Overall, we reveal a critical control node defining nociceptive terminal structure, which is regulating nociception.

Abstract: Aim
To demonstrate the role and mechanism of luteolin in radio-sensitization and angiogenesis of laryngeal cancer.
Methods
Firstly, we analyzed the cytotoxicity of Luteolin and radiation sensitive cytotoxicity through CCK8, and selected subsequent radiation doses and Luteolin concentrations. Next, we further analyzed the effects of Luteolin on radiation sensitivity and neovascularization of laryngeal cancer, and conducted CCK8, plate cloning, and angiogenesis experiments, respectively. At the same time, the effects of individual treatment and combination treatment on the expression of Integrin β1 and VEGFA were analyzed through immunofluorescence analysis. We also analyzed the regulation of Integrin β1 protein expression by Luteolin through Western blot. To investigate the mechanism of Integrin β1, we transfected overexpressed and silenced Integrin β1 vectors and analyzed the role of Integrin β1 in Luteolin enhancing radiation sensitivity of laryngeal cancer by repeating the above experiments. We have also constructed an in vivo subcutaneous tumor transplantation model to further validate the cell experimental results. The expression of Integrin, KI67, VEGFA, and CD31 was analyzed through Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments.
Results
Radiation inhibited cell proliferation and decreased Integrin β1 expression, and increased the radiosensitivity through inhibiting cell proliferation, and inhibit angiogenesis during radiation. Overexpression of Integrin β1 weakened radiotherapy sensitivity on the basis of cells treated with combined administration. Integrin β1 is considered as the downstream molecule of luteolin, participating in radiosensitivity of luteolin to FaDu cells. Animal experiments also demonstrated that luteolin strengthened tumor suppression and anti-angiogenesis during radiation via Integrin β1.
Conclusion
In summary, our results manifested that radio-sensitivity effect of luteolin depended on downregulating Integrin β1 in laryngocarcinoma.

Abstract: Tissue engineering is a science that uses the combination of scaffolds, cells, and active biomolecules to make tissue in order to restore or maintain its function and improve the damaged tissue or even an organ in the laboratory. The purpose of this research was to study the characteristics and biocompatibility of decellularized sheep tracheal scaffolds and also to investigate the differentiation of Adipose-derived stem cells (AD-MSCs) into tracheal cells. After the decellularization of sheep tracheas through the detergent-enzyme method, histological evaluations, measurement of biochemical factors, measurement of DNA amount, and photographing the ultrastructure of the samples by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), they were also evaluated mechanically. Further, In order to check the viability and adhesion of stem cells to the decellularized scaffolds, adipose mesenchymal stem cells were cultured on the scaffolds, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)− 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed. The expression analysis of the intended genes for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into tracheal cells was evaluated by the real-time PCR method. These results show that the prepared scaffolds are an ideal model for engineering applications, have high biocompatibility, and that the tracheal scaffold provides a suitable environment for the differentiation of ADMSCs. This review provides a basis for future research on tracheal decellularization scaffolds, serves as a suitable model for organ regeneration, and paves the way for their use in clinical medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains unclear but is critical for detecting molecular residual disease (MRD). In this prospective study, we sequenced 761 blood samples from 139 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT). ctDNA concentrations showed a significantly declining trend as CRT progressed at on-RT and after-RT time points versus baseline. Thirty-eight (27.3%) patients with early undetectable ctDNA at both on-RT (RT reached 40 Gy) and after-RT time points, indicating early response to CRT, had better survival outcomes for both with or without consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors. Longitudinal undetectable MRD was found in 20.1% patients. The 2-year cancer-specific progression-free survival of these patients was 88.4%, corresponding to a potentially cured population. Further analysis revealed that pretreatment ctDNA variants serve as an essential MRD informed source. These data provide clinical insights for ctDNA-MRD detection.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers in animals and play fundamental roles in many cellular processes. Understanding how their composition varies across diverse cell types and how it is altered in disease are major unresolved questions, yet currently available centrosome isolation protocols are cumbersome and time-consuming, and they lack scalability. Here, we report the development of centrosome affinity capture (CAPture)-mass spectrometry (MS), a powerful one-step purification method to obtain high-resolution centrosome proteomes from mammalian cells. Utilizing a synthetic peptide derived from CCDC61 protein, CAPture specifically isolates intact centrosomes. Importantly, as a bead-based affinity method, it enables rapid sample processing and multiplexing unlike conventional approaches. Our study demonstrates the power of CAPture-MS to elucidate cell-type-dependent heterogeneity in centrosome composition, dissect hierarchical interactions, and identify previously unknown centrosome components. Overall, CAPture-MS represents a transformative tool to unveil temporal, regulatory, cell-type- and tissue-specific changes in centrosome proteomes in health and disease.

Abstract: Background
Cigarette smoke exposure poses significant health risks, including oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue damage, and neurodegenerative diseases. Luteolin, a natural flavonoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is of interest in countering these effects.
Aim
This study aims to assess luteolin's protective potential against cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in adult zebrafish.
Materials and Methods
Adult zebrafish were exposed to CSE for 15 days, inducing smoke-related damage. Subsequent luteolin treatment assessed its impact. Evaluations included antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT), nitric oxide (NO), LDH activity (cellular damage), tissue integrity, fibrosis, amyloid plaque accumulation, and CSE component analysis via HPLC.
Key Findings
CSE exposure heightened oxidative stress, reducing SOD and CAT activity and elevating NO levels, leading to cellular damage and tissue disruption, notably fibrosis and amyloid plaque accumulation. Inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-1β also increased. Luteolin treatment restored SOD and CAT activity, reduced LDH and NO activity, counteracting oxidative damage. It also mitigated fibrosis and reduced amyloid plaque deposition, preserving tissue integrity. Luteolin reduced TNF-α and IL-1β levels and CSE components, displaying anti-inflammatory effects.
Significance
This study underscores luteolin's potential as a protective agent against cigarette smoke-induced harm in a zebrafish model.

Abstract: Summary
The integrity of the nuclear envelope (NE) is essential for maintaining the structural stability of the nucleus. Rupture of the NE has been frequently observed in cancer cells, especially in the context of mechanical challenges, such as physical confinement and migration. However, spontaneous NE rupture events, without any obvious physical challenges to the cell, have also been described. The molecular mechanism(s) of these spontaneous NE rupture events remain to be explored. Here, we show that DNA damage and subsequent ATR activation leads to NE rupture. Upon DNA damage, lamin A/C is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner, leading to changes in lamina assembly and, ultimately, NE rupture. In addition, we show that cancer cells with intrinsic DNA repair defects undergo frequent events of DNA-damage-induced NE rupture, which renders them extremely sensitive to further NE perturbations. Exploiting this NE vulnerability could provide a new angle to complement traditional, DNA-damage-based chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Following viral infection, the human immune system generates CD8+ T cell responses to virus antigens that differ in specificity, abundance, and phenotype. A characterization of virus-specific T cell responses allows one to assess infection history and to understand its contribution to protective immunity. Here, we perform in-depth profiling of CD8+ T cells binding to CMV-, EBV-, influenza-, and SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens in peripheral blood samples from 114 healthy donors and 55 cancer patients using high-dimensional mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. We analyze over 500 antigen-specific T cell responses across six different HLA alleles and observed unique phenotypes of T cells specific for antigens from different virus categories. Using machine learning, we extract phenotypic signatures of antigen-specific T cells, predict virus specificity for bulk CD8+ T cells, and validate these predictions, suggesting that machine learning can be used to accurately predict antigen specificity from T cell phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer genomes from patients with African (AFR) ancestry have been poorly studied in clinical research. We leverage two large genomic cohorts to investigate the relationship between genomic alterations and AFR ancestry in six common cancers. Cross-cancer type associations, such as an enrichment of MYC amplification with AFR ancestry in lung, breast, and prostate cancers, and depletion of BRAF alterations are observed in colorectal and pancreatic cancers. There are differences in actionable alterations, such as depletion of KRAS G12C and EGFR L858R, and enrichment of ROS1 fusion with AFR ancestry in lung cancers. Interestingly, in lung cancer, KRAS mutations are less common in both smokers and non-smokers with AFR ancestry, whereas the association of TP53 mutations with AFR ancestry is only seen in smokers, suggesting an ancestry-environment interaction that modifies driver rates. Our study highlights the need to increase representation of patients with AFR ancestry in drug development and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Although lineage-specific genes have been identified in the mammary gland, little is known about the contribution of the 3D genome organization to gene regulation in the epithelium. Here, we describe the chromatin landscape of the three major epithelial subsets through integration of long- and short-range chromatin interactions, accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression. While basal genes display exquisite lineage specificity via distal enhancers, luminal-specific genes show widespread promoter priming in basal cells. Cell specificity in luminal progenitors is largely mediated through extensive chromatin interactions with super-enhancers in gene-body regions in addition to interactions with polycomb silencer elements. Moreover, lineage-specific transcription factors appear to be controlled through cell-specific chromatin interactivity. Finally, chromatin accessibility rather than interactivity emerged as a defining feature of the activation of quiescent basal stem cells. This work provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the role of higher-order chromatin interactions in cell-fate specification and differentiation in the adult mouse mammary gland.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria (MT) participate in most metabolic activities of mammalian cells. A near-unidirectional mitochondrial transfer from T cells to cancer cells was recently observed to “metabolically empower” cancer cells while “depleting immune cells,” providing new insights into tumor-T cell interaction and immune evasion. Here, we leverage single-cell RNA-seq technology and introduce MERCI, a statistical deconvolution method for tracing and quantifying mitochondrial trafficking between cancer and T cells. Through rigorous benchmarking and validation, MERCI accurately predicts the recipient cells and their relative mitochondrial compositions. Application of MERCI to human cancer samples identifies a reproducible MT transfer phenotype, with its signature genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, energy production, and TNF-α signaling pathways. Moreover, MT transfer is associated with increased cell cycle activity and poor clinical outcome across different cancer types. In summary, MERCI enables systematic investigation of an understudied aspect of tumor-T cell interactions that may lead to the development of therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: Summary
The receptor protein PEX5, an important component of peroxisomes, regulates growth, development, and immunity in yeast and mammals. PEX5 also influences growth and development in plants, but whether it participates in plant immunity has remained unclear. Here, we report that knockdown of OsPEX5 enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We demonstrate that OsPEX5 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6, a positive regulator of plant immunity. APIP6 ubiquitinates OsPEX5 in vitro and promotes its degradation in vivo via the 26S proteasome pathway. In addition, OsPEX5 interacts with the aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2B1, which functions in growth-defense trade-offs in rice. OsPEX5 stabilizes OsALDH2B1 to enhance its repression of the defense-related gene OsAOS2. Our study thus uncovers a previously unrecognized hierarchical regulatory mechanism in which an E3 ubiquitin ligase targets a peroxisome receptor protein that negatively regulates immunity in rice by stabilizing an aldehyde dehydrogenase that suppresses defense gene expression.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a refractory entity with a progressive course and no effective therapeutic options. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential involvement of both glabridin and dexamethasone (Dex) in inflammatory and fibrotic responses in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. The role of Ca+2-activated K+ channels (BKCa) in the anti-inflammatory effects of glabridin was also examined. Adult female Wistar rats were divided into six groups: saline control, BLM, BLM+Gla (BLM+glabridin), BLM+IbTX+Gla (BLM+iberiotoxin+Gla, BKCa channel blocker), BLM+Dex, and BLM+Veh (BLM+dimethylsulfoxide). Inflammatory cell count values, and interleukin (IL)− 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in order to measure fibrosis and the extent of tissue damage, in addition to stereological, immunohistochemical and histopathological examinations. Whole-body plethysmography was used to evaluate pulmonary function. Treatments with glabridin and Dex significantly reduced pathological injury and fibrosis in lung tissue, levels of TNF-α and IL-6 increased by BLM, oxidative stress, and fibrillin-1 scoring. Glabridin and Dex also reversed the increases observed in neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage counts in BAL fluid induced by BLM. Glabridin and Dex were found to ameliorate the abnormal course of PIF, PEF, EV, TV, f, and Penh values caused by BLM. Our findings suggest that glabridin and Dex may exert anti-fibrotic effects by suppressing oxidative stress and inhibiting the inflammatory response, and that glabridin may improve pulmonary function through activation of BKCa channels. Both glabridin and Dex may therefore be of therapeutic use in pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
When compared to other malignancies, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is relatively devoid of immune infiltrates. While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces a complex immune infiltrate in localized prostate cancer, the composition of the TME in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), and the effects of ADT and other treatments in this context are poorly understood. Here, we perform a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of metastatic sites from patients participating in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03951831) that evaluated standard-of-care chemo-hormonal therapy combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We perform a longitudinal, protein activity-based analysis of TME subpopulations, revealing immune subpopulations conserved across multiple metastatic sites. We also observe dynamic changes in these immune subpopulations in response to treatment and a correlation with clinical outcomes. Our study uncovers a therapy-resistant, transcriptionally distinct tumor subpopulation that expands in cell number in treatment-refractory patients.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying molecular specializations in cortical circuitry supporting complex behaviors, like learned vocalizations, requires understanding of the neuroanatomical context from which these circuits arise. In songbirds, the robust arcopallial nucleus (RA) provides descending cortical projections for fine vocal-motor control. Using single-nuclei transcriptomics and spatial gene expression mapping in zebra finches, we have defined cell types and molecular specializations that distinguish RA from adjacent regions involved in non-vocal motor and sensory processing. We describe an RA-specific projection neuron, differential inhibitory subtypes, and glia specializations and have probed predicted GABAergic interneuron subtypes electrophysiologically within RA. Several cell-specific markers arise developmentally in a sex-dependent manner. Our interactive apps integrate cellular data with developmental and spatial distribution data from the gene expression brain atlas ZEBrA. Users can explore molecular specializations of vocal-motor neurons and support cells that likely reflect adaptations key to the physiology and evolution of vocal control circuits and refined motor skills.

Abstract: Background
Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a primary culprit of acute kidney injury. Neurodegeneration can result from I/R, but the mechanisms are still challenging. We studied the implications of bilateral renal I/R on brain and potential involvement of the oxidative stress (OS) driven extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (ERK1/2, JNK) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3)/nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-қB)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), and caspase-3 paths upregulation. We tested the impact of Nano-trimetazidine (Nano-TMZ) on these pathways being a target of its neuroprotective effects.
Methods
Study groups; Sham, I/R, TMZ+I/R, and Nano-TMZ+I/R. Kidney functions, cognition, hippocampal OS markers, Gal-3, NF-қB, p65 and HMGB-1 gene expression, TNF-α level, t-JNK/p-JNK and t-ERK/p-ERK proteins, caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding protein-1 (Iba-1) were assessed.
Results
Nano-TMZ averted renal I/R-induced hippocampal impairment by virtue of its anti: oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic properties.
Conclusion
Nano-TMZ is more than anti-ischemic.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine synapses play a crucial role in volitional movement and reward-related behaviors, while dysfunction of dopamine synapses causes various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Despite this significance, the true biological nature of dopamine synapses remains poorly understood. Here, we show that dopamine transmission is strongly correlated with GABA co-transmission across the brain and dopamine synapses are structured and function like GABAergic synapses with marked regional heterogeneity. In addition, GABAergic-like dopamine synapses are clustered on the dendrites, and GABA transmission at dopamine synapses has distinct physiological properties. Interestingly, the knockdown of neuroligin-2, a key postsynaptic protein at GABAergic synapses, unexpectedly does not weaken GABA co-transmission but instead facilitates it at dopamine synapses in the striatal neurons. More importantly, the attenuation of GABA co-transmission precedes deficits in dopaminergic transmission in animal models of Parkinson’s disease. Our findings reveal the spatial and functional nature of GABAergic-like dopamine synapses in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Acyl-protein thioesterases 1 and 2 (APT1 and APT2) reverse S-acylation, a potential regulator of systemic glucose metabolism in mammals. Palmitoylation proteomics in liver-specific knockout mice shows that APT1 predominates over APT2, primarily depalmitoylating mitochondrial proteins, including proteins linked to glutamine metabolism. miniTurbo-facilitated determination of the protein-protein proximity network of APT1 and APT2 in HepG2 cells reveals APT proximity networks encompassing mitochondrial proteins including the major translocases Tomm20 and Timm44. APT1 also interacts with Slc1a5 (ASCT2), the only glutamine transporter known to localize to mitochondria. High-fat-diet-fed male mice with dual (but not single) hepatic deletion of APT1 and APT2 have insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia, increased glutamine-driven gluconeogenesis, and decreased liver mass. These data suggest that APT1 and APT2 regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism and insulin signaling is functionally redundant. Identification of substrates and protein-protein proximity networks for APT1 and APT2 establishes a framework for defining mechanisms underlying metabolic disease.

Abstract: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of acinar cells. It may develop into severe chronic pancreatitis with a significant mortality rate. The current study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of a Lactobacillus (LAB) mixture against rat AP. Six groups were created including control, taurine (300 mg/kg; i.p.) for 7 days, LAB mixture for 7 days, L-arginine (2.5 g/kg; i.p.) 2 doses with 1 h interval on 1st day, L-arginine+taurine, and L-arginine+LAB. Serum amylase and lipase activities were measured. Pancreatic tissue was used for histopathological examination, oxidative stress biomarkers including malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH), and inflammatory biomarkers including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and interleukin (IL)-33 assessment. qRT-PCR was used for transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) investigation and Western blot analysis for measuring nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κBp65) and the apoptosis biomarker; caspase-3. Taurine and LAB reduced lipase and significantly ameliorated induced oxidative stress by normalizing MDA and GSH contents. They counteracted inflammation by reducing MPO, IL-33, NF-κBp65, and TRPV-1. In addition, taurine and LAB counteracted apoptosis as proved by reduced caspase-3 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that taurine and the use LAB mixture can mitigate AP by L-arginine via influencing TRPV-1/IL-33/NF-κB signaling together with exhibiting potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage elicits a checkpoint response depending on the Mec1/ATR kinase, which detects the presence of single-stranded DNA and activates the effector kinase Rad53/CHK2. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the signaling circuits leading to Rad53 activation involves the evolutionarily conserved 9-1-1 complex, which acts as a platform for the binding of Dpb11 and Rad9 (referred to as the 9-1-1 axis) to generate a protein complex that allows Mec1 activation. By examining the effects of both loss-of-function and hypermorphic mutations, here, we show that the Cdc55 and Tpd3 subunits of the PP2A phosphatase counteract activation of the 9-1-1 axis. The lack of this inhibitory function results in DNA-damage sensitivity, sustained checkpoint-mediated cell-cycle arrest, and impaired resection of DNA double-strand breaks. This PP2A anti-checkpoint role depends on the capacity of Cdc55 to interact with Ddc1 and to counteract Ddc1-Dpb11 complex formation by preventing Dpb11 recognition of Ddc1 phosphorylated on Thr602.

Abstract: Summary
The activity of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons, the main output structure of basal ganglia, is altered in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the type of neurons responsible for PD-related motor dysfunctions have been elucidated yet. Here, we show that parvalbumin-expressing SNr neurons (SNr-PV+) occupy dorsolateral parts and possess specific electrophysiological properties compared with other SNr cells. We also report that only SNr-PV+ neurons’ intrinsic excitability is reduced by downregulation of sodium leak channels in a PD mouse model. Interestingly, in anesthetized parkinsonian mice in vivo, SNr-PV+ neurons display a bursty pattern of activity dependent on glutamatergic tone. Finally, we demonstrate that chemogenetic inhibition of SNr-PV+ neurons is sufficient to alleviate motor impairments in parkinsonian mice. Overall, our findings establish cell-type-specific dysfunction in experimental parkinsonism in the SNr and provide a potential cellular therapeutic target to alleviate motor symptoms in PD.

Abstract: Summary
The itch-scratching cycle is mediated by neural dynamics in the brain. However, our understanding of the neural dynamics during this cycle remains limited. In this study, we examine the neural dynamics of 126 mouse brain areas by measuring the calcium signal using fiber photometry. We present numerous response patterns in the mouse brain during the itch-scratching cycle. Interestingly, we find that a group of brain areas exhibit activation only at the end of histamine-induced scratching behavior. Additionally, several brain areas exhibit transient activation at the onset of scratching induced by chloroquine. Both histamine- and chloroquine-induced itch evoke diverse response patterns across the mouse brain. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive dataset for the diverse activity pattern of mouse brain during the itch-scratching cycle, paving the way for further exploration into the neural mechanisms underlying the itch-scratching cycle.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide transposable element repression in animal germ lines. In Drosophila, piRNAs are produced from heterochromatic loci, called piRNA clusters, which act as information repositories about genome invaders. piRNA generation by dual-strand clusters depends on the chromatin-bound Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex, which is deposited on clusters guided by piRNAs, forming a positive feedback loop in which piRNAs promote their own biogenesis. However, how piRNA clusters are formed before cognate piRNAs are present remains unknown. Here, we report spontaneous de novo piRNA cluster formation from repetitive transgenic sequences. Cluster formation occurs over several generations and requires continuous trans-generational maternal transmission of small RNAs. We discovered that maternally supplied small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) trigger de novo cluster activation in progeny. In contrast, siRNAs are dispensable for cluster function after its establishment. These results reveal an unexpected interplay between the siRNA and piRNA pathways and suggest a mechanism for de novo piRNA cluster formation triggered by siRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Super-enhancers (SEs) are stretches of enhancers ensuring a high level of expression of key genes associated with cell function. The identification of cancer-specific SE-driven genes is a powerful means for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Here, we identify a MITF/SOX10/TFIIH-dependent SE promoting the expression of BAHCC1 in a broad panel of melanoma cells. BAHCC1 is highly expressed in metastatic melanoma and is required for tumor engraftment, growth, and dissemination. Integrative genomics analyses reveal that BAHCC1 is a transcriptional regulator controlling expression of E2F/KLF-dependent cell-cycle and DNA-repair genes. BAHCC1 associates with BRG1-containing remodeling complexes at the promoters of these genes. BAHCC1 silencing leads to decreased cell proliferation and delayed DNA repair. Consequently, BAHCC1 deficiency cooperates with PARP inhibition to induce melanoma cell death. Our study identifies BAHCC1 as an SE-driven gene expressed in melanoma and demonstrates how its inhibition can be exploited as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Ischemic brain injury is a severe medical condition with high incidences in elderly people without effective treatment for the resulting neural damages. Using a unilateral mouse stroke model, we analyze single-cell transcriptomes of ipsilateral and contralateral cortical penumbra regions to objectively reveal molecular events with single-cell resolution at 4 h and 1, 3, and 7 days post-injury. Here, we report that neurons are among the first cells that sense the lack of blood supplies by elevated expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). To our surprise, the canonical inflammatory cytokine gene targets for C/EBPβ, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), are subsequently induced also in neuronal cells. Neuronal-specific silencing of C/EBPβ or IL-1β and TNF-α substantially alleviates downstream inflammatory injury responses and is profoundly neural protective. Taken together, our findings reveal a neuronal inflammatory mechanism underlying early pathological triggers of ischemic brain injury.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies have identified numerous loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the functional roles of many loci remain unexplored. Here, we engineered isogenic knockout human embryonic stem cell lines for 20 genes associated with T2D risk. We examined the impacts of each knockout on β cell differentiation, functions, and survival. We generated gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles on β cells derived from each knockout line. Analyses of T2D-association signals overlapping HNF4A-dependent ATAC peaks identified a likely causal variant at the FAIM2 T2D-association signal. Additionally, the integrative association analyses identified four genes (CP, RNASE1, PCSK1N, and GSTA2) associated with insulin production, and two genes (TAGLN3 and DHRS2) associated with β cell sensitivity to lipotoxicity. Finally, we leveraged deep ATAC-seq read coverage to assess allele-specific imbalance at variants heterozygous in the parental line and identified a single likely functional variant at each of 23 T2D-association signals.

Abstract: Summary
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a ubiquitously expressed architectural protein, has emerged as a key regulator of cell identity gene transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying specialized functions of CTCF remains elusive. Here, we investigate the mechanism through integrative analyses of primary hepatocytes, myocytes, and B cells from mouse and human. We demonstrate that CTCF cooperates with lineage-specific pioneer transcription factors (TFs), including MyoD, FOXA, and PU.1, to control cell identity at 1D and 3D levels. At the 1D level, pioneer TFs facilitate lineage-specific CTCF occupancy via opening chromatin. At the 3D level, CTCF and pioneer TFs form regulatory hubs to govern the expression of cell identity genes. This mechanism is validated using MyoD-null mice, CTCF knockout mice, and CRISPR editing during myogenic differentiation. Collectively, these findings uncover a general mechanism whereby CTCF acts as a cell identity cofactor to control cell identity genes via orchestrating regulatory hubs with pioneer TFs.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell technologies promise to uncover how transcriptional programs orchestrate complex processes during embryogenesis. Here, we apply a combination of single-cell technology and genetic analysis to investigate the dynamic transcriptional changes associated with Drosophila embryo morphogenesis at gastrulation. Our dataset encompassing the blastoderm-to-gastrula transition provides a comprehensive single-cell map of gene expression across cell lineages validated by genetic analysis. Subclustering and trajectory analyses revealed a surprising stepwise progression in patterning to transition zygotic gene expression and specify germ layers as well as uncovered an early role for ecdysone signaling in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the mesoderm. We also show multipotent progenitors arise prior to gastrulation by analyzing the transcription trajectory of caudal mesoderm cells, including a derivative that ultimately incorporates into visceral muscles of the midgut and hindgut. This study provides a rich resource of gastrulation and elucidates spatially regulated temporal transitions of transcription states during the process.

Abstract: Summary
The insular cortex (IC) has been linked to the processing of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals associated with addictive behavior. However, whether the IC modulates the acquisition of drug-related affective states by direct top-down connectivity with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons is unknown. We found that photostimulation of VTA terminals of the anterior insular cortex (aIC) induces rewarding contextual memory, modulates VTA activity, and triggers dopamine release within the VTA. Employing neuronal recordings and neurochemical and transsynaptic tagging techniques, we disclose the functional top-down organization tagging the aIC pre-synaptic neuronal bodies and identifying VTA recipient neurons. Furthermore, systemic administration of amphetamine altered the VTA excitability of neurons modulated by the aIC projection, where photoactivation enhances, whereas photoinhibition impairs, a contextual rewarding behavior. Our study reveals a key circuit involved in developing and retaining drug reward-related contextual memory, providing insight into the neurobiological basis of addictive behavior and helping develop therapeutic addiction strategies.

Abstract: Summary
This study investigates stress’s impact on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using male APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Negative stressors (chronic social defeat, restraint) and positive hedonia (environmental enrichment, EE) were applied. Stress worsens AD pathology, while EE slows progression. Brain RNA sequencing reveals interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 as key stress-related AD regulators. Flow cytometry shows that the CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio shifts in response to stress exposure and EE. Stress exposure increases CD8+/CD4+ ratio, opposite to EE. Depletion and enrichment of CD8+ T cells both accelerate AD, indicating immune intervention’s negative impact. Stress management and balanced immunity may aid AD therapy, highlighting novel potential treatment.

Abstract: Background
Hypoxia is a vital feature of the tumor microenvironment of OC. Previous evidence exposes that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are connected with the development of ovarian cancer (OC), whereas the accurate regulatory mechanism of hypoxic macrophages regulating tumor advancement remains unclear. Herein, we examined whether the lysine demethylase 3 A (KDM3A) in hypoxic macrophages expedited the development of OC cells.
Methods
The contents of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), CD163, CD80, KDM3A, and p-Akt/Akt were detected by western blot. Genomic Spatial Event 4630, Molecular Signatures Database, and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database were utilized for correlated gene prediction. The OC cells viability was scrutinized by cell counting kit-8 assay. The cell proliferation was inspected by 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assay. The vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) level was detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
M2 polarization of TAMs was associated with poor prognosis in sufferers with OC. The OC sufferers with high level of CD163 or low level of CD80 were linked with poor overall survival and disease specific survival. Hypoxia induced THP-1-derived macrophages M2 polarization. KDM3A was high-expressed in hypoxia induced macrophages. Upregulated KDM3A in hypoxic macrophages facilitated OC cell proliferation. KDM3A upregulation in hypoxic macrophages stimulated Akt signaling activation in OC cells. KDM3A in hypoxic macrophages promoted VEGF secretion to activate Akt signaling in OC cells. VEGF inhibition or Akt signaling inactivation reversed the effects of KDM3A in hypoxic macrophages on OC cells viability and proliferation.
Conclusion
The KDM3A content and M2 polarization were enhanced in hypoxic macrophages, and KDM3A in hypoxic macrophages promoted OC development through regulation of the VEGF/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a persistent anti-proliferative response that acts as a barrier against malignant transformation. During OIS, cells undergo dynamic remodeling, which involves alterations in protein and organelle homeostasis through autophagy. Here, we show that ribosomes are selectively targeted for degradation by autophagy during OIS. By characterizing senescence-dependent alterations in the ribosomal interactome, we find that the deubiquitinase USP10 dissociates from the ribosome during the transition to OIS. This release of USP10 leads to an enhanced ribosome ubiquitination, particularly of small subunit proteins, including lysine 275 on RPS2. Both reinforcement of the USP10-ribosome interaction and mutation of RPS2 K275 abrogate ribosomal delivery to lysosomes without affecting bulk autophagy. We show that the selective recruitment of ubiquitinated ribosomes to autophagosomes is mediated by the p62 receptor. While ribophagy is not required for the establishment of senescence per se, it contributes to senescence-related metabolome alterations and facilitates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
It is widely assumed that all normal somatic cells can equally perform homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining in the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that the DDR in normal mammary gland inherently depends on the epithelial cell lineage identity. Bioinformatics, post-irradiation DNA damage repair kinetics, and clonogenic assays demonstrated luminal lineage exhibiting a more pronounced DDR and HR repair compared to the basal lineage. Consequently, basal progenitors were far more sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) in both mouse and human mammary epithelium. Furthermore, PARPi sensitivity of murine and human breast cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived xenografts correlated with their molecular resemblance to the mammary progenitor lineages. Thus, mammary epithelial cells are intrinsically divergent in their DNA damage repair capacity and PARPi vulnerability, potentially influencing the clinical utility of this targeted therapy.

Abstract: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of the most debilitating cerebral complications of liver cirrhosis. The one-year survival of patients with liver cirrhosis and severe encephalopathy is less than 50%. Recent studies have indicated that neuroinflammation is a new player in the pathogenesis of HE, which seems to be involved in the development of cognitive impairment. In this study, we demonstrated neurobehavioral and neuropathological consequences of liver cirrhosis and tested the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor, etanercept. Sixty male adult Wistar albino rats (120–190 g) were allocated into four groups, where groups I and IV served as controls. Thioacetamide (TAA; 300 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected twice a week for five months to induce liver cirrhosis in group II (n = 20). Both TAA and etanercept (2 mg/kg) were administered to group III (n = 20). At the end of the experiment, spatial learning was assessed using Morris water maze. TNF-α was detected in both serum and hippocampus. The excised brains were also immunohistochemically stained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to estimate both the number and integrity of hippocampal astrocytes. Ultrastructural changes in the hippocampus were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that blocking TNF-α by etanercept was accompanied by a lower TNF-α expression and a higher number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus. Etanercept intervention alleviated the neuronal and glial degenerative changes and impeded the deterioration of spatial learning ability. In conclusion, TNF-α is strongly involved in the development of liver cirrhosis and the associated encephalopathy. TNF-α blockers may be a promising approach for management of hepatic cirrhosis and its cerebral complications.

Abstract: Summary
Although biochemical regulation has been extensively studied in organoid modeling protocols, the role of mechanoregulation in directing stem cell fate and organoid development has been relatively unexplored. To accurately replicate the dynamic organoid development observed in nature, in this study, we present a method of heterogeneous embedding using an alginate-shell-Matrigel-core system. This approach allows for cell-Matrigel remodeling by the inner layer and provides short-term moderate-normal compression through the soft alginate outer layer. Our results show that the time-limited confinement contributes to increased expression of neuronal markers such as neurofilament (NF) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Compared with non-alginate embedding and alginate compression groups, volume growth remains unimpeded. Our findings demonstrate the temporary mechanical regulation of cerebral organoid growth, which exhibits a regular growth profile with enhanced maturation. These results highlight the importance and potential practical applications of mechanoregulation in the establishment of brain organoids. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of factors in nucleocytoplasmic transport is closely linked to neural developmental diseases. Mutation in Hikeshi, encoding a nonconventional nuclear import carrier of heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70s), leads to inherited leukodystrophy; however, the pathological mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed that Hikeshi is essential for central nervous system (CNS) myelination. Deficiency of Hikeshi, which is observed in inherited leukodystrophy patients, resulted in murine oligodendrocyte maturation arrest. Hikeshi is required for nuclear translocation of HSP70s upon differentiation. Nuclear-localized HSP70 promotes murine oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination after white matter injury. Mechanistically, HSP70s interacted with SOX10 in the nucleus and protected it from E3 ligase FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination degradation. Importantly, we discovered that Hikeshi-dependent hyperthermia therapy, which induces nuclear import of HSP70s, promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination following in vivo demyelinating injury. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Hikeshi-mediated nuclear translocation of HSP70s is essential for myelinogenesis and provide insights into pathological mechanisms of Hikeshi-related leukodystrophy.

Abstract: Summary
In metabolic engineering, predicting gene overexpression targets remains challenging because both endogenous and heterologous genes in a large metabolic space can be candidates, in contrast to gene knockout targets that are confined to endogenous genes. We report the development of iBridge that identifies positive and negative metabolites exerting positive and negative impacts on product formation, respectively, based on the sum of covariances of their outgoing (consuming) reaction fluxes for a target chemical. Then, “bridge” reactions converting negative metabolites to positive metabolites are identified as overexpression targets, while the opposites as downregulation targets. Using iBridge, overexpression and downregulation targets are suggested for the production of 298 chemicals and validated for 36 chemicals experimentally demonstrated in previous studies. Finally, iBridge is employed to engineer Escherichia coli strains capable of producing 10.3 g/L of D-panthenol, a compound not previously produced, as well as putrescine and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate at enhanced titers, 63.7 and 8.3 g/L, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pulmonary infection. As a Gram-negative pathogen, it can initiate a brisk and highly destructive inflammatory response; however, most hosts become tolerant to the bacterial burden, developing chronic infection. Using a murine model of pneumonia, we demonstrate that this shift from inflammation to disease tolerance is promoted by ketogenesis. In response to pulmonary infection, ketone bodies are generated in the liver and circulate to the lungs where they impose selection for P. aeruginosa strains unable to display surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Such keto-adapted LPS strains fail to activate glycolysis and tissue-damaging cytokines and, instead, facilitate mitochondrial catabolism of fats and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which maintains airway homeostasis. Within the lung, P. aeruginosa exploits the host immunometabolite itaconate to further stimulate ketogenesis. This environment enables host-P. aeruginosa coexistence, supporting both pathoadaptive changes in the bacteria and the maintenance of respiratory integrity via OXPHOS.

Abstract: Summary
Pioneering advances in genome engineering, and specifically in genome writing, have revolutionized the field of synthetic biology, propelling us toward the creation of synthetic genomes. The Sc2.0 project aims to build the first fully synthetic eukaryotic organism by assembling the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With the completion of synthetic chromosome VIII (synVIII) described here, this goal is within reach. In addition to writing the yeast genome, we sought to manipulate an essential functional element: the point centromere. By relocating the native centromere sequence to various positions along chromosome VIII, we discovered that the minimal 118-bp CEN8 sequence is insufficient for conferring chromosomal stability at ectopic locations. Expanding the transplanted sequence to include a small segment (∼500 bp) of the CDEIII-proximal pericentromere improved chromosome stability, demonstrating that minimal centromeres display context-dependent functionality.

Abstract: Summary
The losses caused by Vibrio infections in the aquaculture industry are challenging to quantify. In the face of antibiotic resistance, a natural and environmentally friendly alternative is urgently needed. In this study, we identify E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF103 (rnf103) as a crucial target involved in immune evasion by Vibrio anguillarum. Our research demonstrates that Rnf103 promotes immune escape by inhibiting Traf6. Interestingly, we discover a circular RNA (circRNA), circRnf103, formed by reverse splicing of the Rnf103 gene. Predictive analysis and experimentation reveal that circRnf103 encodes Rnf103-177aa, a protein that competes with Rnf103 and binds to Traf6, preventing its degradation. Notably, circRnf103 therapy induces Rnf103-177aa protein production in zebrafish. In zebrafish models, circRnf103 exhibits significant effectiveness in treating V. anguillarum infections, reducing organ burden. These findings highlight the potential of circRNA therapy as a natural and innovative approach to combat infectious diseases sustainably, particularly in aquaculture and environmental management.

Abstract: Summary
UV irradiation induces “bulky” DNA photodimers such as (6-4)-photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are removed by nucleotide excision repair, a complex process defective in the sunlight-sensitive and cancer-prone disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Some bacteria and lower eukaryotes can also repair photodimers by enzymatically simpler mechanisms, but such pathways have not been reported in normal human cells. Here, we have identified such a mechanism. We show that normal human cells can employ a DNA base excision repair process involving NTH1, APE1, PARP1, XRCC1, and FEN1 to rapidly remove a subset of photodimers at early times following UVC irradiation. Loss of these proteins slows the early rate of repair of photodimers in normal cells, ablates their residual repair in xeroderma pigmentosum cells, and increases UVC sensitivity ∼2-fold. These data reveal that human cells can excise photodimers using a long-patch base excision repair process that functions additively but independently of nucleotide excision repair.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of naive CD8+ T lymphocytes into cytotoxic effector and memory CTL results in large-scale changes in transcriptional and phenotypic profiles. Little is known about how large-scale changes in genome organization underpin these transcriptional programs. We use Hi-C to map changes in the spatial organization of long-range genome contacts within naive, effector, and memory virus-specific CD8+ T cells. We observe that the architecture of the naive CD8+ T cell genome is distinct from effector and memory genome configurations, with extensive changes within discrete functional chromatin domains associated with effector/memory differentiation. Deletion of BACH2, or to a lesser extent, reducing SATB1 DNA binding, within naive CD8+ T cells results in a chromatin architecture more reminiscent of effector/memory states. This suggests that key transcription factors within naive CD8+ T cells act to restrain T cell differentiation by actively enforcing a unique naive chromatin state.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a unique bacterial second messenger but is hijacked by host cells during bacterial infection as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to trigger STING-dependent immune responses. Here, we show that upon infection, VopY, an effector of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is injected into host cells by type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2), a secretion system unique to its pathogenic strains and indispensable for enterotoxicity. VopY is an EAL-domain-containing phosphodiesterase and is capable of hydrolyzing c-di-GMP. VopY expression in host cells prevents the activation of STING and STING-dependent downstream signaling triggered by c-di-GMP and, consequently, suppresses type I interferon immune responses. The presence of VopY in V. parahaemolyticus enables it to cause both T3SS2-dependent enterotoxicity and cytotoxicity. These findings uncover the destruction of self-derived PAMPs by injecting specific effectors to suppress PAMP-triggered immune responses as a unique strategy for bacterial pathogens to subvert immunity and cause disease.

Abstract: Summary
Grid-cells firing fields tile the environment with a 6-fold periodicity during both locomotion and visual exploration. Here, we tested, in humans, whether movements of covert attention elicit grid-like coding using frequency tagging. Participants observed visual trajectories presented sequentially at fixed rate, allowing different spatial periodicities (e.g., 4-, 6-, and 8-fold) to have corresponding temporal periodicities (e.g., 1, 1.5, and 2 Hz), thus resulting in distinct spectral responses. We found a higher response for the (grid-like) 6-fold periodicity and localized this effect in medial-temporal sources. In a control experiment featuring the same temporal periodicity but lacking spatial structure, the 6-fold effect did not emerge, suggesting its dependency on spatial movements of attention. We report evidence that grid-like signals in the human medial-temporal lobe can be elicited by covert attentional movements and suggest that attentional coding may provide a suitable mechanism to support the activation of cognitive maps during conceptual navigation.

Abstract: Summary
A high-fat diet (HFD) promotes metastasis through increased uptake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs). The fatty acid transporter CD36 has been implicated in this process, but a detailed understanding of CD36 function is lacking. During matrix detachment, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress reduces SCD1 protein, resulting in increased lipid saturation. Subsequently, CD36 is induced in a p38- and AMPK-dependent manner to promote preferential uptake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), thereby maintaining a balance between SFAs and MUFAs. In attached cells, CD36 palmitoylation is required for MUFA uptake and protection from palmitate-induced lipotoxicity. In breast cancer mouse models, CD36-deficiency induced ER stress while diminishing the pro-metastatic effect of HFD, and only a palmitoylation-proficient CD36 rescued this effect. Finally, AMPK-deficient tumors have reduced CD36 expression and are metastatically impaired, but ectopic CD36 expression restores their metastatic potential. Our results suggest that, rather than facilitating HFD-driven tumorigenesis, CD36 plays a supportive role by preventing SFA-induced lipotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Cognate interaction between CD4+ effector memory T (TEM) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) induces innate inflammatory cytokine production, resulting in detrimental autoimmune pathology and cytokine storms. While TEM cells use tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily ligands to activate DCs, whether TEM cells prompt other DC-intrinsic changes that influence the innate inflammatory response has never been investigated. We report the surprising discovery that TEM cells trigger double-strand DNA breaks via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in interacting DCs. Initiation of the DNA damage response in DCs induces activation of a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS)-independent, non-canonical stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling axis. Consequently, STING-deficient DCs display reduced NF-κB activation and subsequent defects in transcriptional induction and functional production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 following their interaction with TEM cells. The discovery of TEM cell-induced innate inflammation through DNA damage and a non-canonical STING-NF-κB pathway presents this pathway as a potential target to alleviate T cell-driven inflammation in autoimmunity and cytokine storms.

Abstract: Summary
Sporulating bacteria can retreat into long-lasting dormant spores that preserve the capacity to germinate when propitious. However, how the revival transcriptional program is memorized for years remains elusive. We revealed that in dormant spores, core RNA polymerase (RNAP) resides in a central chromosomal domain, where it remains bound to a subset of intergenic promoter regions. These regions regulate genes encoding for most essential cellular functions, such as rRNAs and tRNAs. Upon awakening, RNAP recruits key transcriptional components, including sigma factor, and progresses to express the adjacent downstream genes. Mutants devoid of spore DNA-compacting proteins exhibit scattered RNAP localization and subsequently disordered firing of gene expression during germination. Accordingly, we propose that the spore chromosome is structured to preserve the transcriptional program by halting RNAP, prepared to execute transcription at the auspicious time. Such a mechanism may sustain long-term transcriptional programs in diverse organisms displaying a quiescent life form.

Abstract: Summary
Our knowledge of transcriptional responses to changes in nutrient availability comes primarily from few well-studied transcription factors (TFs), often lacking an unbiased genome-wide perspective. Leveraging recent advances allowing bacterial genomic footprinting, we comprehensively mapped the genome-wide regulatory responses of Escherichia coli to exogenous leucine, methionine, alanine, and lysine. The global TF Lrp was found to individually sense three amino acids and mount three different target gene responses. Overall, 531 genes had altered RNA polymerase occupancy, and 32 TFs responded directly or indirectly to the presence of amino acids, including regulators of membrane and osmotic pressure homeostasis. About 70% of the detected TF-DNA interactions had not been reported before. We thus identified 682 previously unknown TF-binding locations, for a subset of which the involved TFs were identified by affinity purification. This comprehensive map of amino acid regulation illustrates the incompleteness of the known transcriptional regulation network, even in E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) is a conserved eukaryotic protein complex that links the presence of nutrients with cell growth. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC1 activity is positively regulated by the presence of amino acids and glucose in the medium. However, the mechanisms underlying nutrient-induced TORC1 activation remain poorly understood. By utilizing an in vivo TORC1 activation assay, we demonstrate that differential metabolism of glucose activates TORC1 through three distinct pathways in yeast. The first “canonical Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-dependent pathway” requires conversion of glucose to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which activates TORC1 via the Rag GTPase heterodimer Gtr1GTP-Gtr2GDP. The second “non-canonical Rag GTPase-dependent pathway” requires conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, which activates TORC1 via a process that involves Gtr1GTP-Gtr2GTP and mitochondrial function. The third “Rag GTPase-independent pathway” requires complete glycolysis and vacuolar ATPase reassembly for TORC1 activation. We have established a roadmap to deconstruct the link between glucose metabolism and TORC1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. In recent years, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefits, especially in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, acquired drug resistance and relapse is a major challenge. Indisulam (E7070) has been identified as a molecular glue that brings together splicing factor RBM39 and DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase resulting in polyubiquitination, degradation, and subsequent RNA splicing defects. In this work, we demonstrate that the loss of RBM39 induces splicing defects in key DNA damage repair genes in ovarian cancer, leading to increased sensitivity to cisplatin and various PARP inhibitors. The addition of indisulam also improved olaparib response in mice bearing PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors. These findings demonstrate that combining RBM39 degraders and PARP inhibitors is a promising therapeutic approach to improve PARP inhibitor response in ovarian HGSC.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor microbiota can produce active metabolites that affect cancer and immune cell signaling, metabolism, and proliferation. Here, we explore tumor and gut microbiome features that affect chemoradiation response in patients with cervical cancer using a combined approach of deep microbiome sequencing, targeted bacterial culture, and in vitro assays. We identify that an obligate L-lactate-producing lactic acid bacterium found in tumors, Lactobacillus iners, is associated with decreased survival in patients, induces chemotherapy and radiation resistance in cervical cancer cells, and leads to metabolic rewiring, or alterations in multiple metabolic pathways, in tumors. Genomically similar L-lactate-producing lactic acid bacteria commensal to other body sites are also significantly associated with survival in colorectal, lung, head and neck, and skin cancers. Our findings demonstrate that lactic acid bacteria in the tumor microenvironment can alter tumor metabolism and lactate signaling pathways, causing therapeutic resistance. Lactic acid bacteria could be promising therapeutic targets across cancer types.

Abstract: Background
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a serious threat to human health, and tumor development is associated with abnormal mitochondrial function. It is believed that the introduction of healthy mitochondria into tumor cells can induce the oxidative stress in tumor cells to return to normal levels, thus exerting an inhibitory effect on tumor growth.
Methods
Mitochondria isolated from 143BρW cells were co-cultured with HuCCT1 cells, and the mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker dye as a tracking label. Changes in apoptosis, proliferation, oxidative stress, and PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were assessed. In addition, a CCA nude mouse transplantation tumor model was constructed to analyze the effects of mitochondrial transplantation on the above factors in nude mice. Furthermore, the expression of PTEN was interfered to observe the effect and mechanism of mitochondrial transplantation on the proliferation and apoptosis of CCA cells.
Results
Mitochondrial transplantation promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in CCA cell line. SOD, GSH, and CAT activities were significantly increased, the expression of PTEN was activated, and the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT were inhibited after mitochondrial transplantation. After mitochondrial transplantation + si-PTEN treatment, cell apoptosis, SOD, GSH, CAT activity, and the expression of PTEN were decreased, while the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT were significantly enhanced.
Conclusion
This study reveals the anti-tumor potential of mitochondrial transplantation through PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate cellular oxidative stress in CCA.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of alternative splicing has been repeatedly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the extent of cell-type-specific splicing in human neural development remains largely uncharted. Here, single-cell long-read sequencing in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids identifies over 31,000 uncatalogued isoforms and 4,531 cell-type-specific splicing events. Long reads uncover coordinated splicing and cell-type-specific intron retention events, which are challenging to study with short reads. Retained neuronal introns are enriched in RNA splicing regulators, showing shorter lengths, higher GC contents, and weaker 5′ splice sites. We use this dataset to explore the biological processes underlying neurological disorders, focusing on autism. In comparison with prior transcriptomic data, we find that the splicing program in autistic brains is closer to the progenitor state than differentiated neurons. Furthermore, cell-type-specific exons harbor significantly more de novo mutations in autism probands than in siblings. Overall, these results highlight the importance of cell-type-specific splicing in autism and neuronal gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Substantial divergence in cardio-metabolic risk, muscle size, and performance exists between men and women. Considering the pivotal role of skeletal muscle in human physiology, we investigated and found, based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), that differences in the muscle transcriptome between men and women are largely related to testosterone and estradiol and much less related to genes located on the Y chromosome. We demonstrate inherent unique, sex-dependent differences in muscle transcriptional responses to aerobic, resistance, and combined exercise training in young and older cohorts. The hormonal changes with age likely explain age-related differential expression of transcripts. Furthermore, in primary human myotubes we demonstrate the profound but distinct effects of testosterone and estradiol on amino acid incorporation to multiple individual proteins with specific functions. These results clearly highlight the potential of designing exercise programs tailored specifically to men and women and have implications for people who change gender by altering their hormone profile.

Abstract: Summary
T cell receptor (TCR) Vγ4-expressing γδ T cells comprise interferon γ (IFNγ)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing effector subsets, with a preference for IL-17 effector fate decisions during early ontogeny. The existence of adult-thymus-derived IL-17+ T cells (γδ17) remains controversial. Here, we use a mouse model in which T cells are generated exclusively in the adult thymus and employ single-cell chromatin state analysis to study their development. We identify adult-thymus-derived Vγ4 T cells that have all the molecular programs to become IL-17 producers. However, they have reduced IL-17 production capabilities and rarely reach the periphery. Moreover, this study provides high-resolution profiles of Vγ4 T cells in the adult thymus and lymph nodes and identifies Zeb1 as a potential γδ17 cell regulator. Together, this study provides valuable insights into the developmental traits of Vγ4 T cells during adulthood and supports the idea of age-specific signals required for thymic export and/or peripheral maturation of γδ17 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Borneo was a crossroad of ancient dispersals, with some of the earliest Southeast Asian human remains and rock art. The island is home to traditionally hunter-gatherer Punan communities, whose origins, whether of subsistence reversion or long-term foraging, are unclear. The connection between its past and present-day agriculturalist inhabitants, who currently speak Austronesian languages and have composite and complex genetic ancestry, is equally opaque. Here, we analyze the genetic ancestry of the northeastern Bornean Punan Batu (who still practice some mobile hunting and gathering), Tubu, and Aput. We find deep ancestry connections, with a shared Asian signal outgrouping modern and ancient Austronesian-ancestry proxies, suggesting a time depth of more than 7,500 years. They also largely lack the mainland Southeast Asian signals of agricultural Borneans, who are themselves genetically heterogeneous. Our results support long-term inhabitation of Borneo by some Punan ancestors and reveal unexpected complexity in the origins and dispersal of Austronesian-expansion-related ancestry.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) belong to the family Filoviridae and cause a severe disease in humans. We previously isolated a large panel of monoclonal antibodies from B cells of human survivors from the 2007 Uganda BDBV outbreak, 16 survivors from the 2014 EBOV outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and one survivor from the West African 2013–2016 EBOV epidemic. Here, we demonstrate that EBOV and BDBV are capable of spreading to neighboring cells through intercellular connections in a process that depends upon actin and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin 1 protein. We quantify spread through intercellular connections by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. One of the antibodies, BDBV223, specific to the membrane-proximal external region, induces virus accumulation at the plasma membrane. The inhibiting activity of BDBV223 depends on BST2/tetherin.

Abstract: Summary
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily manifested by a variety of physiological properties of brain endothelial cells (ECs), but the molecular foundation for these properties remains incompletely clear. Here, we generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult brain ECs using acutely purified mouse ECs and integrated multi-omics. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics, we identify the transcripts and proteins selectively enriched in brain ECs and demonstrate that they are partially correlated. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we dissect the molecular basis of functional heterogeneity of brain ECs. Using integrative epigenomics and transcriptomics, we determine that TCF/LEF, SOX, and ETS families are top-ranked transcription factors regulating the BBB. We then validate the identified brain-EC-enriched proteins and transcription factors in normal mouse and human brain tissue and assess their expression changes in mice with Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, we present a valuable resource with broad implications for regulation of the BBB and treatment of neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Transferable plasmids play a critical role in shaping the functions of microbial communities. Previous studies suggested multiple mechanisms underlying plasmid persistence and abundance. Here, we focus on the interplay between heterogeneous community partitioning and plasmid fates. Natural microbiomes often experience partitioning that creates heterogeneous local communities with reduced population sizes and biodiversity. Little is known about how population partitioning affects the plasmid fate through the modulation of community structure. By modeling and experiments, we show that heterogeneous community partitioning can paradoxically promote the persistence of a plasmid that would otherwise not persist in a global community. Among the local communities created by partitioning, a minority will primarily consist of members able to transfer the plasmid fast enough to support its maintenance by serving as a local plasmid haven. Our results provide insights into plasmid maintenance and suggest a generalizable approach to modulate plasmid persistence for engineering and medical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) demonstrates promise in operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but lacks available efficacy biomarkers. Here, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of tumors from patients with ESCC undergoing neoadjuvant ICB, revealing a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells expressing SPRY1 (CD8+ Tex-SPRY1) that displays a progenitor exhausted T cell (Tpex) phenotype and correlates with complete response to ICB. We validate CD8+ Tex-SPRY1 cells as an ICB-specific predictor of improved response and survival using independent ICB-/non-ICB cohorts and demonstrate that expression of SPRY1 in CD8+ T cells enforces Tpex phenotype and enhances ICB efficacy. Additionally, CD8+ Tex-SPRY1 cells contribute to proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages and functional state of B cells, which thereby promotes antitumor immunity by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions. Overall, our findings unravel progenitor-like CD8+ Tex-SPRY1 cells’ role in effective responses to ICB for ESCC and inform mechanistic biomarkers for future individualized immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Platelets are anucleate blood cells that contain mitochondria and regulate blood clotting in response to injury. Mitochondria contain their own gene expression machinery that relies on nuclear-encoded factors for the biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system to produce energy required for thrombosis. The autonomy of the mitochondrial gene expression machinery from the nucleus is unclear, and platelets provide a valuable model to understand its importance in anucleate cells. Here, we conditionally delete Elac2, Ptcd1, or Mtif3 in platelets, which are essential for mitochondrial gene expression at the level of RNA processing, stability, or translation, respectively. Loss of ELAC2, PTCD1, or MTIF3 leads to increased megakaryocyte ploidy, elevated circulating levels of reticulated platelets, thrombocytopenia, and consequent extended bleeding time. Impaired mitochondrial gene expression reduces agonist-induced platelet activation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show that mitochondrial gene expression is required for fibrinolysis, hemostasis, and blood coagulation in response to injury.

Abstract: Summary
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically lengthened lifespan among people with HIV (PWH), but this population experiences heightened rates of inflammation-related comorbidities. HIV-associated inflammation is linked with an altered microbiome; whether such alterations precede inflammation-related comorbidities or occur as their consequence remains unknown. We find that ART-treated PWH exhibit depletion of gut-resident bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)—crucial microbial metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. Prior reports establish that fecal SCFA concentrations are not depleted in PWH. We find that gut-microbiota-mediated SCFA production capacity is better reflected in serum than in feces and that PWH exhibit reduced serum SCFA, which associates with inflammatory markers. Leveraging stool and serum samples collected prior to comorbidity onset, we find that HIV-specific microbiome alterations precede morbidity and mortality in ART-treated PWH. Among these microbiome alterations, reduced microbiome-mediated conversion of lactate to propionate precedes mortality in PWH. Thus, gut microbial fiber/lactate conversion to SCFAs may modulate HIV-associated comorbidity risk.

Abstract: Summary
Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in higher eukaryotes that encode proteins important for the assembly of the translational apparatus (e.g., ribosomal proteins) often harbor a pyrimidine-rich motif at the extreme 5′ end known as a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (5′TOP) sequence. Members of the La-related protein 1 (LARP1) family control 5′TOP expression through a conserved DM15 motif, but the mechanism is not well understood. 5′TOP motifs have not been described in many lower organisms, and fission yeast harbors a LARP1 homolog that also lacks a DM15 motif. In this work, we show that the fission yeast LARP1 homolog, Slr1p, controls the translation and stability of mRNAs encoding proteins analogous to 5′TOP mRNAs in higher eukaryotes, which we thus refer to as proto-5′TOPs. Our data suggest that the LARP1 DM15 motif and the mRNA 5′TOP motif may be features that were scaffolded over a more fundamental mechanism of LARP1-associated control of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of transcription-coupled histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) contributes to shorter lifespans in eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanism of the decline of H3K36me3 during aging remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the degradation of the methyltransferase Set2 is the cause of decreased H3K36me3 levels during chronological aging in budding yeast. We show that Set2 protein degradation during cellular senescence and chronological aging is mainly mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme Ubc3 and the E3 ligase Bre1. Lack of Bre1 or abolishment of the ubiquitination stabilizes Set2 protein, sustains H3K36me3 levels at the aging-related gene loci, and upregulates their gene expression, thus leading to extended chronological lifespan. We further illustrate that Gcn5-mediated Set2 acetylation is a prerequisite for Bre1-catalyzed Set2 polyubiquitination and proteolysis during aging. We propose that two sequential post-translational modifications regulate Set2 homeostasis, suggesting a potential strategy to target the Gcn5-Bre1-Set2 axis for intervention of longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Cells activate stress response pathways to survive adverse conditions. Such responses involve the inhibition of global cap-dependent translation. This inhibition is a block that essential transcripts must escape via alternative methods of translation initiation, e.g., an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IRESs have distinct structures and generally require a limited repertoire of translation factors. Cellular IRESs have been identified in many critical cellular stress response transcripts. We previously identified cellular IRESs in the murine insulin receptor (Insr) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) transcripts and demonstrated their resistance to eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) inhibition. Here, we find that eIF5B preferentially promotes Insr, Igf1r, and hepatitis C virus IRES activity through a non-canonical mechanism that requires its highly charged and disordered N terminus. We find that the N-terminal region of eIF5B can drive cytoplasmic granule formation. This eIF5B granule is triggered by cellular stress and is sufficient to specifically promote IRES activity.

Abstract: Summary
By sorting receptor tyrosine kinases into endolysosomes, the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) are thought to attenuate oncogenic signaling in tumor cells. Paradoxically, ESCRT members are upregulated in tumors. Here, we show that disruption of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), a pivotal ESCRT component, inhibited tumor growth by promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration in melanoma and colon cancer mouse models. HRS ablation led to misfolded protein accumulation and triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in the activation of the type I interferon pathway in an inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)-dependent manner. HRS was upregulated in tumor cells with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). HRS expression associates with the response to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy in melanoma patients with high TMB tumors. HRS ablation sensitized anti-PD-1 treatment in mouse melanoma models. Our study shows a mechanism by which tumor cells with high TMB evade immune surveillance and suggests HRS as a promising target to improve immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-), derived from S. Typhimurium, has become the dominant serotype causing human salmonellosis. In this study, we define the genetic mechanism of the generation of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- from S. Typhimurium through complicated transpositions and demonstrate that Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- displays more efficient colonization and survival abilities in mice than its parent S. Typhimurium strain. We identified intermediate strains carrying both resistance regions (RRs) and the fljAB operon for the generation of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-. The insertion of RR3 into the chromosomal hin-iroB site of S. Typhimurium produced RR3-S. Typhimurium as a primary intermediate. Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- was then produced by replacing the fljAB operon and/or its flanking sequences through intramolecular transpositions mediated by IS26 and/or IS1R elements in RR3-S. Typhimurium, which was further confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism underlying the origin, generation, and advantage of RRs-Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- from S. Typhimurium.

Abstract: Summary
Episodic memory requires the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to guide decisions by representing events in spatial, temporal, and personal contexts. Both brain regions have been described by cognitive theories that represent events in context as locations in maps or memory spaces. We query whether ensemble spiking in these regions described spatial structures as rats performed memory tasks. From each ensemble, we construct a state-space with each point defined by the coordinated spiking of single and pairs of units in 125-ms bins and investigate how state-space locations discriminate task features. Trajectories through state-spaces correspond with behavioral episodes framed by spatial, temporal, and internal contexts. Both hippocampal and prefrontal ensembles distinguish maze locations, task intervals, and goals by distances between state-space locations, consistent with cognitive mapping and relational memory space theories of episodic memory. Prefrontal modulation of hippocampal activity may guide choices by directing memory representations toward appropriate state-space goal locations.

Abstract: Summary
In solid tumors, drug concentrations decrease with distance from blood vessels. However, cellular adaptations accompanying the gradated exposure of cancer cells to drugs are largely unknown. Here, we modeled the spatiotemporal changes promoting chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. Using pairwise cell competition assays at each step during the acquisition of chemoresistance, we reveal an important priming phase that renders cancer cells previously exposed to sublethal drug concentrations refractory to dose escalation. Therapy-resistant cells throughout the concentration gradient display higher expression of the solute carriers SLC38A7 and SLC46A1 and elevated intracellular concentrations of their associated metabolites. Reduced levels of SLC38A7 and SLC46A1 diminish the proliferative potential of cancer cells, and elevated expression of these SLCs in breast tumors from patients correlates with reduced survival. Our work provides mechanistic evidence to support dose-intensive treatment modalities for patients with solid tumors and reveals two members of the SLC family as potential actionable targets.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle function declines in the aging process or disease; however, until now, skeletal muscle has remained one of the organs most undertreated with medication. In this study, naringenin (NAR) was found to build muscle endurance in wild-type mice of different ages by increasing oxidative myofiber numbers and aerobic metabolism, and it ameliorates muscle dysfunction in mdx mice. The transcription factor Sp1 was identified as a direct target of NAR and was shown to mediate the function of NAR on muscle. Moreover, the binding site of NAR on Sp1 was further validated as GLN-110. NAR enhances the binding of Sp1 to the CCCTGCCCTC sequence of the Esrrg promoter by promoting Sp1 phosphorylation, thus upregulating Esrrg expression. The identification of the Sp1-ERRγ transcriptional axis is of great significance in basic muscle research, and this function of NAR has potential implications for the improvement of muscle function and the prevention of muscle atrophy.
