Abstract: Summary
Actin-based protrusions extend from the surface of all eukaryotic cells, where they support diverse activities essential for life. Models of protrusion growth hypothesize that actin filament assembly exerts force for pushing the plasma membrane outward. However, membrane-associated myosin motors are also abundant in protrusions, although their potential for contributing, growth-promoting force remains unexplored. Using an inducible system that docks myosin motor domains to membrane-binding modules with temporal control, we found that application of myosin-generated force to the membrane is sufficient for driving robust protrusion elongation in human, mouse, and pig cell culture models. Protrusion growth scaled with motor accumulation, required barbed-end-directed force, and was independent of cargo delivery or recruitment of canonical elongation factors. Application of growth-promoting force was also supported by structurally distinct myosin motors and membrane-binding modules. Thus, myosin-generated force can drive protrusion growth, and this mechanism is likely active in diverse biological contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located protein with cytoprotective effects in neurons and pancreatic β cells in vitro and in models of neurodegeneration and diabetes in vivo. However, the exact mode of MANF action has remained elusive. Here, we show that MANF directly interacts with the ER transmembrane unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor IRE1α, and we identify the binding interface between MANF and IRE1α. The expression of wild-type MANF, but not its IRE1α binding-deficient mutant, attenuates UPR signaling by decreasing IRE1α oligomerization; phosphorylation; splicing of Xbp1, Atf6, and Txnip levels; and protecting neurons from ER stress-induced death. MANF-IRE1α interaction and not MANF-BiP interaction is crucial for MANF pro-survival activity in neurons in vitro and is required to protect dopamine neurons in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease. Our data show IRE1α as an intracellular receptor for MANF and regulator of neuronal survival.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal form of lung cancer. Here, we develop a quantitative multiplexed approach on the basis of lentiviral barcoding with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to functionally investigate candidate regulators of tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC. We found that naphthalene pre-treatment enhances lentiviral vector-mediated SCLC initiation, enabling high multiplicity of tumor clones for analysis through high-throughput sequencing methods. Candidate drivers of SCLC identified from a meta-analysis across multiple human SCLC genomic datasets were tested using this approach, which defines both positive and detrimental impacts of inactivating 40 genes across candidate pathways on SCLC development. This analysis and subsequent validation in human SCLC cells establish TSC1 in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as a robust tumor suppressor in SCLC. This approach should illuminate drivers of SCLC, facilitate the development of precision therapies for defined SCLC genotypes, and identify therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Under normal homeostatic conditions, self-double-stranded RNA (self-dsRNA) is modified by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) to prevent the induction of a type I interferon-mediated inflammatory cascade. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as dsRNA, to activate the immune response. The impact of ADAR1 on the function of APCs and the consequences to immunity are poorly understood. Here, we show that ADAR1 deletion in CD11c+ APCs leads to (1) a skewed myeloid cell compartment enriched in inflammatory cDC2-like cells, (2) enhanced numbers of activated tissue resident memory T cells in the lung, and (3) the imprinting of a broad antiviral transcriptional signature across both immune and non-immune cells. The resulting changes can be partially reversed by blocking IFNAR1 signaling and promote early resistance against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our study provides insight into the consequences of self-dsRNA sensing in APCs on the immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Bipolar cells (BCs) are integral to the retinal circuits that extract diverse features from the visual environment. They bridge photoreceptors to ganglion cells, the source of retinal output. Understanding how such circuits encode visual features requires an accounting of the mechanisms that control glutamate release from bipolar cell axons. Here, we demonstrate orientation selectivity in a specific genetically identifiable type of mouse bipolar cell—type 5A (BC5A). Their synaptic terminals respond best when stimulated with vertical bars that are far larger than their dendritic fields. We provide evidence that this selectivity involves enhanced excitation for vertical stimuli that requires gap junctional coupling through connexin36. We also show that this orientation selectivity is detectable postsynaptically in direction-selective ganglion cells, which were not previously thought to be selective for orientation. Together, these results demonstrate how multiple features are extracted by a single hierarchical network, engaging distinct electrical and chemical synaptic pathways.

Abstract: Studies on the morphology of the reproductive system are essential for understanding the reproduction processes of species or even within genera or families. The present study aimed to describe the functional morphology of the male reproductive system, spermatophore formation, and sperm count of Macrobrachium brasiliense. The anatomy of the reproductive system consists of a pair of testes from which the vasa deferentia (VD) starts, extending to the fifth pair of pereopods. The VD is divided into three regions: proximal (PVD), middle (MVD), and distal (DVD). In the PVD, there is a prominent fold, the typhlosole, formed by columnar cells. The typhlosole disappears in the MVD, being incorporated into one of the faces of the VD wall, identified by its simple columnar epithelium while the remainder of the vessel wall is formed by squamous or simple cubic epithelium. Columnar cells produce type-II and III secretion. The epithelium in the DVD is made up only of cubic cells. Low sperm concentration was observed when compared to other species of the genus Macrobrachium. In conclusion, the typhlosole and columnar epithelium are responsible for the asymmetric spermatophore, which seems the pattern of Macrobrachium that is probably shared with other caridean shrimps.

Abstract: Summary
Effective therapeutic strategies are needed for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations that acquire resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) mediated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We investigate cell surface proteins that could be targeted by antibody-based or adoptive cell therapy approaches and identify CD70 as being highly upregulated in EMT-associated resistance. Moreover, CD70 upregulation is an early event in the evolution of resistance and occurs in drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPCs). CD70 promotes cell survival and invasiveness, and stimulation of CD70 triggers signal transduction pathways known to be re-activated with acquired TKI resistance. Anti-CD70 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and CD70-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell and CAR NK cells show potent activity against EGFR TKI-resistant cells and DTPCs. These results identify CD70 as a therapeutic target for EGFR mutant tumors with acquired EGFR TKI resistance that merits clinical investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Odor-based learning and innate odor-driven behavior have been hypothesized to require separate neuronal circuitry. Contrary to this notion, innate behavior and olfactory learning were recently shown to share circuitry that includes the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). But how a single circuit drives two discrete behaviors remains unknown. Here, we define an MB circuit responsible for both olfactory learning and innate odor avoidance and the distinct dDA1 dopamine receptor-dependent signaling pathways that mediate these behaviors. Associative learning and learning-induced MB plasticity require rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase activity in the MB. In contrast, innate odor preferences driven by naive MB neurotransmission are rutabaga independent, requiring the adenylyl cyclase ACXD. Both learning and innate odor preferences converge on PKA and the downstream MBON-γ2α′1. Importantly, the utilization of this shared circuitry for innate behavior only becomes apparent with hunger, indicating that hardwired innate behavior becomes more flexible during states of stress.

Abstract: Summary
Human cells license tens of thousands of origins of replication in G1 and then must stop all licensing before DNA synthesis in S phase to prevent re-replication and genome instability that ensue when an origin is licensed on replicated DNA. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4Cdt2 only starts to degrade the licensing factor CDT1 after origin firing, raising the question of how cells prevent re-replication before CDT1 is fully degraded. Here, using quantitative microscopy and in-vitro-reconstituted human DNA replication, we show that CDT1 inhibits DNA synthesis during an overlap period when CDT1 is still present after origin firing. CDT1 inhibits DNA synthesis by suppressing CMG helicase at replication forks, and DNA synthesis commences once CDT1 is degraded. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing model that human cells prevent re-replication by strictly separating licensing from firing, licensing and firing overlap, and cells instead separate licensing from DNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism by which arcuate nucleus kisspeptin (ARNKISS) neurons co-expressing glutamate, neurokinin B, and dynorphin intermittently synchronize their activity to generate pulsatile hormone secretion remains unknown. An acute brain slice preparation maintaining synchronized ARNKISS neuron burst firing was used alongside in vivo GCaMP GRIN lens microendoscope and fiber photometry imaging coupled with intra-ARN microinfusion. Studies in intact and gonadectomized male mice revealed that ARNKISS neuron synchronizations result from near-random emergent network activity within the population and that this was critically dependent on local glutamate-AMPA signaling. Whereas neurokinin B operated to potentiate glutamate-generated synchronizations, dynorphin-kappa opioid tone within the network served as a gate for synchronization initiation. These observations force a departure from the existing “KNDy hypothesis” for ARNKISS neuron synchronization. A “glutamate two-transition” mechanism is proposed to underlie synchronizations in this key hypothalamic central pattern generator driving mammalian fertility.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between transcription and cohesin-mediated loop extrusion can influence 3D chromatin architecture. However, their relevance in biology is unclear. Here, we report a direct role for such interactions in the mechanism of antibody class switch recombination (CSR) at the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (Igh). Using Tri-C to measure higher-order multiway interactions on single alleles, we find that the juxtaposition (synapsis) of transcriptionally active donor and acceptor Igh switch (S) sequences, an essential step in CSR, occurs via the interaction of loop extrusion complexes with a de novo topologically associating domain (TAD) boundary formed via transcriptional activity across S regions. Surprisingly, synapsis occurs predominantly in proximity to the 3′ CTCF-binding element (3′CBE) rather than the Igh super-enhancer, suggesting a two-step mechanism whereby transcription of S regions is not topologically coupled to synapsis, as has been previously proposed. Altogether, these insights advance our understanding of how 3D chromatin architecture regulates CSR.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor suppression by TP53 involves cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. TP53 can suppress tumor growth by modulating immune system functions; however, the mechanistic basis for this activity is not well understood. We report that p53 promotes the degradation of the DNA exonuclease TREX1, resulting in cytosolic dsDNA accumulation. We demonstrate that p53 requires the ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 to induce TREX1 degradation. The cytosolic DNA accumulation resulting from TREX1 degradation activates the cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, resulting in induction of type I interferons. TREX1 overexpression sufficed to block p53 activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. p53-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFNB1) is suppressed by cGAS/STING knockout, and p53’s tumor suppressor activities are compromised by the loss of signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. Thus, our study reveals that p53 utilizes the cGAS/STING innate immune system pathway for both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic tumor suppressor activities.

Abstract: Summary
Although recent studies have highlighted the impact of gut microbes on the progression of obesity and its comorbidities, it is not fully understood how these microbes promote these disorders, especially in terms of the role of microbial metabolites. Here, we report that Fusimonas intestini, a commensal species of the family Lachnospiraceae, is highly colonized in both humans and mice with obesity and hyperglycemia, produces long-chain fatty acids such as elaidate, and consequently facilitates diet-induced obesity. High fat intake altered the expression of microbial genes involved in lipid production, such as the fatty acid metabolism regulator fadR. Monocolonization with a FadR-overexpressing Escherichia coli exacerbated the metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that the change in bacterial lipid metabolism is causally involved in disease progression. Mechanistically, the microbe-derived fatty acids impaired intestinal epithelial integrity to promote metabolic endotoxemia. Our study thus provides a mechanistic linkage between gut commensals and obesity through the overproduction of microbe-derived lipids.

Abstract: Summary
WNT signaling is important in development, stem cell maintenance, and disease. WNT ligands typically signal via receptor activation across the plasma membrane to induce β-catenin-dependent gene activation. Here, we show that in mammalian primary cilia, WNT receptors relay a WNT/GSK3 signal that β-catenin-independently promotes ciliogenesis. Characterization of a LRP6 ciliary targeting sequence and monitoring of acute WNT co-receptor activation (phospho-LRP6) support this conclusion. Ciliary WNT signaling inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity, a negative regulator of ciliogenesis, by preventing GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the PP1 regulatory inhibitor subunit PPP1R2. Concordantly, deficiency of WNT/GSK3 signaling by depletion of cyclin Y and cyclin-Y-like protein 1 induces primary cilia defects in mouse embryonic neuronal precursors, kidney proximal tubules, and adult mice preadipocytes.

Abstract: Summary
In the hippocampus, environmental changes elicit rearrangement of active neuronal ensembles or remapping of place cells. However, it remains elusive how the brain ensures a consistent representation of a certain environment itself despite salient events occurring there. Here, we longitudinally tracked calcium dynamics of dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice subjected to contextual fear conditioning and extinction training. Overall population activities were significantly changed by fear conditioning and were responsive to footshocks and freezing. However, a small subset of neurons, termed environment cells, were consistently active in a specific environment irrespective of experiences. A decoder modeling study showed that these cells, but not place cells, were able to predict the environment to which the mouse was exposed. Environment cells might underlie the constancy of cognition for distinct environments across time and events. Additionally, our study highlights the functional heterogeneity of cells in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
During human pregnancy, placenta-derived extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) invade the decidua and communicate with maternal immune cells. The decidua distinguishes into basalis (decB) and parietalis (decP). The latter remains unaffected by EVT invasion. By defining a specific gating strategy, we report the accumulation of macrophages in decB. We describe a decidua basalis-associated macrophage (decBAM) population with a differential transcriptome and secretome compared with decidua parietalis-associated macrophages (decPAMs). decBAMs are CD11chi and efficient inducers of Tregs, proliferate in situ, and secrete high levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, M-CSF, and IL-10. In contrast, decPAMs exert a dendritic cell-like, motile phenotype characterized by induced expression of HLA class II molecules, enhanced phagocytosis, and the ability to activate T cells. Strikingly, EVT-conditioned media convert decPAMs into a decBAM phenotype. These findings assign distinct macrophage phenotypes to decidual areas depending on placentation and further highlight a critical role for EVTs in the induction of decB-associated macrophage polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Most membrane proteins use their first transmembrane domain, known as a signal anchor (SA), for co-translational targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the signal recognition particle (SRP). The SA then inserts into the membrane using either the Sec61 translocation channel or the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) insertase. How EMC and Sec61 collaborate to ensure SA insertion in the correct topology is not understood. Using site-specific crosslinking, we detect a pre-insertion SA intermediate adjacent to EMC. This intermediate forms after SA release from SRP but before ribosome transfer to Sec61. The polypeptide’s N-terminal tail samples a cytosolic vestibule bordered by EMC3, from where it can translocate across the membrane concomitant with SA insertion. The ribosome then docks on Sec61, which has an opportunity to insert those SAs skipped by EMC. These results suggest that EMC acts between SRP and Sec61 to triage SAs for insertion during membrane protein biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory processing is crucial for execution of appropriate behavior. The external globus pallidus (GPe), a nucleus within the basal ganglia, is highly involved in the control of movement and could potentially integrate sensory-motor information. The GPe comprises prototypic and arkypallidal cells, which receive partially overlapping inputs. It is unclear, however, which inputs convey sensory information to them. Here, we used in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse GPe and optogenetic silencing to characterize the pathways that shape the response to whisker stimulation in prototypic and arkypallidal cells. Our results show that sensory integration in prototypic cells is controlled by the subthalamic nucleus and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs), whereas in arkypallidal cells, it is primarily shaped by direct pathway MSNs. These results suggest that GPe subpopulations receive sensory information from largely different neural populations, reinforcing that the GPe consists of two parallel pathways, which differ anatomically and functionally.

Abstract: Summary
Exosomes transport a variety of macromolecules and modulate intercellular communication in physiology and disease. However, the regulation mechanisms that determine exosome contents during exosome biogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we find that GPR143, an atypical GPCR, controls the endosomal sorting complex required for the transport (ESCRT)-dependent exosome biogenesis pathway. GPR143 interacts with HRS (an ESCRT-0 Subunit) and promotes its association to cargo proteins, such as EGFR, which subsequently enables selective protein sorting into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). GPR143 is elevated in multiple cancers, and quantitative proteomic and RNA profiling of exosomes in human cancer cell lines showed that the GPR143-ESCRT pathway promotes secretion of exosomes that carry unique cargo, including integrins signaling proteins. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice, we show that GPR143 promotes metastasis by secreting exosomes and increasing cancer cell motility/invasion through the integrin/FAK/Src pathway. These findings provide a mechanism for regulating the exosomal proteome and demonstrate its ability to promote cancer cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
Precision oncology promises accurate prediction of disease trajectories by utilizing molecular features of tumors. We present a systematic analysis of the prognostic potential of diverse molecular features across large cancer cohorts. We find that the mRNA expression of biologically coherent sets of genes (modules) is substantially more predictive of patient survival than single-locus genomic and transcriptomic aberrations. Extending our analysis beyond existing curated gene modules, we find a large novel class of highly prognostic DNA/RNA cis-regulatory modules associated with dynamic gene expression within cancers. Remarkably, in more than 82% of cancers, modules substantially improve survival stratification compared with conventional clinical factors and prominent genomic aberrations. The prognostic potential of cancer modules generalizes to external cohorts better than conventionally used single-gene features. Finally, a machine-learning framework demonstrates the combined predictive power of multiple modules, yielding prognostic models that perform substantially better than existing histopathological and clinical factors in common use.

Abstract: Summary
Drak2-deficient (Drak2−/−) mice are resistant to multiple models of autoimmunity yet effectively eliminate pathogens and tumors. Thus, DRAK2 represents a potential target to treat autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms by which DRAK2 contributes to autoimmunity, particularly type 1 diabetes (T1D), remain unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that resistance to T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice is due to the absence of Drak2 in T cells and requires the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Contrary to previous hypotheses, we show that DRAK2 does not limit TCR signaling. Rather, DRAK2 regulates IL-2 signaling by inhibiting STAT5A phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that enhanced sensitivity to IL-2 in the absence of Drak2 augments thymic Treg development. Overall, our data indicate that DRAK2 contributes to autoimmunity in multiple ways by regulating thymic Treg development and by impacting the sensitivity of conventional T cells to Treg-mediated suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling mediates host responses to infection, inflammation and anti-tumor immunity. Mutations in the IFN-γ signaling pathway cause immunological disorders, hematological malignancies, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer; however, the function of most clinically observed variants remains unknown. Here, we systematically investigate the genetic determinants of IFN-γ response in colorectal cancer cells using CRISPR-Cas9 screens and base editing mutagenesis. Deep mutagenesis of JAK1 with cytidine and adenine base editors, combined with pathway-wide screens, reveal loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations, including causal variants in hematological malignancies and mutations detected in patients refractory to ICB. We functionally validate variants of uncertain significance in primary tumor organoids, where engineering missense mutations in JAK1 enhanced or reduced sensitivity to autologous tumor-reactive T cells. We identify more than 300 predicted missense mutations altering IFN-γ pathway activity, generating a valuable resource for interpreting gene variant function.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomal amino acid accumulation is implicated in several diseases, but its role in insulin resistance, the central mechanism to type 2 diabetes and many metabolic diseases, is unclear. In this study, we show the hepatic expression of lysosomal membrane protein solute carrier family 7 member 14 (SLC7A14) is increased in insulin-resistant mice. The promoting effect of SLC7A14 on insulin resistance is demonstrated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. SLC7A14 is further demonstrated as a transporter resulting in the accumulation of lysosomal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which induces insulin resistance via inhibiting mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)’s activity. These results establish a causal link between lysosomal amino acids and insulin resistance and suggest that SLC7A14 inhibition may provide a therapeutic strategy in treating insulin resistance-related and GABA-related diseases and may provide insights into the upstream mechanisms for mTORC2, the master regulator in many important processes.

Abstract: Aims
Oxidative stress also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (DN). Both resveratrol (RES) and exercise (EX) have potent anti-oxidative benefits. Low levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and SIRT1 (a member of sirtuin family) have been reported in patients with DN. The current study has been designed to investigate the role of serum NGF and SIRT1 on DN-induced hyperalgesia and motor incoordination and to evaluate the possible protective role of RES and/or EX.
Main methods
A total of 40 male adult albino rats divided into five groups; control, DN, DN + RES, DN + EX, and DN + RES and EX. DN was confirmed by sensorimotor disturbance and diminished nerve conduction velocity (NCV). NGF and SIRT1 levels were measured by western blot. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was measured by PCR. Myofibrillar degeneration and inflammation scores were revealed via H&E microscopic analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle. Immunohistochemical evaluation of caspase3 and TNF-α was performed in the lumber segment of spinal cord and gastrocnemius muscle sections. Ultrastructural evaluation of sciatic nerve axonal degeneration has also been assessed.
Key findings
DN group showed decreased SIRT1 level, decreased NGF level and correlated with CGRP level and Na+/K+ ATPase. Treatment with RES and/or EX resulted in improvement of sensorimotor disturbance. DN characterized by reduced SOD level, whereas RES and/or EX could limit oxidative damage by up-regulation Bcl2, Akt and GAP-43 and down-regulation of caspase3 and TNF-α. In conclusion, increased level of SIRT1and NGF by incorporation of RES (natural supplementation) and EX (life style modification) could improve the neuroinflammatory state in DN.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a powerful tool for disease modeling of hard-to-access tissues (such as the brain). Current protocols either direct neuronal differentiation with small molecules or use transcription-factor-mediated programming. In this study, we couple overexpression of transcription factor Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) with small molecule patterning to differentiate hPSCs into lower induced motor neurons (liMoNes/liMNs). This approach induces canonical MN markers including MN-specific Hb9/MNX1 in more than 95% of cells. liMNs resemble bona fide hPSC-derived MN, exhibit spontaneous electrical activity, express synaptic markers, and can contact muscle cells in vitro. Pooled, multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing on 50 hPSC lines reveals reproducible populations of distinct subtypes of cervical and brachial MNs that resemble their in vivo, embryonic counterparts. Combining small molecule patterning with Ngn2 overexpression facilitates high-yield, reproducible production of disease-relevant MN subtypes, which is fundamental in propelling our knowledge of MN biology and its disruption in disease.

Abstract: Summary
Junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML) serves as a co-stimulatory molecule in γδ T cells. While it has recently been described as a cancer immunotherapy target in mice, its potential to cause toxicity, specific mode of action with regard to its cellular targets, and whether it can be targeted in humans remain unknown. Here, we show that JAML is induced by T cell receptor engagement, reveal that this induction is linked to cis-regulatory interactions between the CD3D and JAML gene loci. When compared with other immunotherapy targets plagued by low target specificity and end-organ toxicity, we find JAML to be mostly restricted to and highly expressed by tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells in multiple cancer types. By delineating the key cellular targets and functional consequences of agonistic anti-JAML therapy in a murine melanoma model, we show its specific mode of action and the reason for its synergistic effects with anti-PD-1.

Abstract: Summary
The maturation of neurons and the development of synapses, although emblematic of neurons, also relies on interactions with astrocytes and other glia. Here, to study the role of glia-neuron interactions, we analyze the transcriptomes of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons, from 80 human donors, that were cultured with or without contact with glial cells. We find that the presence of astrocytes enhances synaptic gene-expression programs in neurons when in physical contact with astrocytes. These changes in neurons correlate with increased expression, in the cocultured glia, of genes that encode synaptic cell adhesion molecules. Both the neuronal and astrocyte gene-expression programs are enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia risk. Our results suggest that astrocyte-expressed genes with synaptic functions are associated with stronger expression of synaptic genetic programs in neurons, and they suggest a potential role for astrocyte-neuron interactions in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
The Solve-RD project objectives include solving undiagnosed rare diseases (RD) through collaborative research on shared genome-phenome datasets. The RD-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP), for data collation and analysis, and the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA), for file storage, are two key components of the Solve-RD infrastructure. Clinical researchers can identify candidate genetic variants within the RD-Connect GPAP and, thanks to the developments presented here as part of joint ELIXIR activities, are able to remotely visualize the corresponding alignments stored at the EGA. The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) htsget streaming application programming interface (API) is used to retrieve alignment slices, which are rendered by an integrated genome viewer (IGV) instance embedded in the GPAP. As a result, it is no longer necessary for over 11,000 datasets to download large alignment files to visualize them locally. This work highlights the advantages, from both the user and infrastructure perspectives, of implementing interoperability standards for establishing federated genomics data networks.

Abstract: Summary
The “inactive” X chromosome (Xi) has been assumed to have little impact, in trans, on the “active” X (Xa). To test this, we quantified Xi and Xa gene expression in individuals with one Xa and zero to three Xis. Our linear modeling revealed modular Xi and Xa transcriptomes and significant Xi-driven expression changes for 38% (162/423) of expressed X chromosome genes. By integrating allele-specific analyses, we found that modulation of Xa transcript levels by Xi contributes to many of these Xi-driven changes (≥121 genes). By incorporating metrics of evolutionary constraint, we identified 10 X chromosome genes most likely to drive sex differences in common disease and sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes. We conclude that human X chromosomes are regulated both in cis, through Xi-wide transcriptional attenuation, and in trans, through positive or negative modulation of individual Xa genes by Xi. The sum of these cis and trans effects differs widely among genes.

Abstract: Summary
The mosquito’s antenna represents its main olfactory appendage for detecting volatile chemical cues from the environment. Whole-mount fluorescence in situ hybridization of ionotropic receptors (IRs) expressed in the antennae reveals that the antenna might be divisible into proximal and distal functional domains. The number of IR-positive cells appear stereotyped within each antennal segment (flagellomere). Highly expressed odor-tuning IRs exhibit distinct co-localization patterns with the IR coreceptors Ir8a, Ir25a, and Ir76b that might predict their functional properties. Genetic knockin and in vivo functional imaging of IR41c-expressing neurons indicate both odor-induced activation and inhibition in response to select amine compounds. Targeted mutagenesis of IR41c does not abolish behavioral responses to the amine compounds. Our study provides a comprehensive map of IR-expressing neurons in the main olfactory appendage of mosquitoes. These findings show organizing principles of Anopheles IR-expressing neurons, which might underlie their functional contribution to the detection of behaviorally relevant odors.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental enhancers bind transcription factors and dictate patterns of gene expression during development. Their molecular evolution can underlie phenotypical evolution, but the contributions of the evolutionary pathways involved remain little understood. Here, using mutation libraries in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we observed that most point mutations in developmental enhancers led to changes in gene expression levels but rarely resulted in novel expression outside of the native pattern. In contrast, random sequences, often acting as developmental enhancers, drove expression across a range of cell types; random sequences including motifs for transcription factors with pioneer activity acted as enhancers even more frequently. Our findings suggest that the phenotypic landscapes of developmental enhancers are constrained by enhancer architecture and chromatin accessibility. We propose that the evolution of existing enhancers is limited in its capacity to generate novel phenotypes, whereas the activity of de novo elements is a primary source of phenotypic novelty.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal hyperactivity induces memory deficits in Alzheimer’s disease. However, how hyperactivity disrupts memory is unclear. Using in vivo synaptic imaging in the mouse visual cortex, we show that structural excitatory-inhibitory synapse imbalance in the apical dendrites favors hyperactivity in early amyloidosis. Consistent with this, natural images elicit neuronal hyperactivity in these mice. Compensatory changes that maintain activity homeostasis disrupt functional connectivity and increase population sparseness such that a small fraction of neurons dominates population activity. These properties reduce the selectivity of neural response to natural images and render visual recognition memory vulnerable to interference. Deprivation of non-specific visual experiences improves the neural representation and behavioral expression of visual familiarity. In contrast, in non-pathological conditions, deprivation of non-specific visual experiences induces disinhibition, increases excitability, and disrupts visual familiarity. We show that disrupted familiarity occurs when the fraction of high-responsive neurons and the persistence of neural representation of a memory-associated stimulus are not constrained.

Abstract: Summary
Previous work in our laboratory has shown that mutations in prickle (pk) cause myoclonic-like seizures and ataxia in Drosophila, similar to what is observed in humans carrying mutations in orthologous PRICKLE genes. Here, we show that pk mutant brains show elevated, sustained neuronal cell death that correlates with increasing seizure penetrance, as well as an upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress and innate immune response (IIR) genes. Moreover, flies exhibiting more robust seizures show increased levels of IIR-associated target gene expression suggesting they may be linked. Genetic knockdown in glia of either arm of the IIR (Immune Deficiency [Imd] or Toll) leads to a reduction in neuronal death, which in turn suppresses seizure activity, with oxidative stress acting upstream of IIR. These data provide direct genetic evidence that oxidative stress in combination with glial-mediated IIR leads to progression of an epilepsy disorder.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 envelope (Env) conformation determines the susceptibility of infected CD4+ T cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Upon interaction with CD4, Env adopts more “open” conformations, exposing ADCC epitopes. HIV-1 limits Env-CD4 interaction and protects infected cells against ADCC by downregulating CD4 via Nef, Vpu, and Env. Limited data exist, however, of the role of these proteins in downmodulating CD4 on infected macrophages and how this impacts Env conformation. While Nef, Vpu, and Env are all required to efficiently downregulate CD4 on infected CD4+ T cells, we show here that any one of these proteins is sufficient to downmodulate most CD4 from the surface of infected macrophages. Consistent with this finding, Nef and Vpu have a lesser impact on Env conformation and ADCC sensitivity in infected macrophages compared with CD4+ T cells. However, treatment of infected macrophages with small CD4 mimetics exposes vulnerable CD4-induced Env epitopes and sensitizes them to ADCC.

Abstract: Summary
Tail-anchored (TA) proteins contain a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) that is captured by the cytosolic Get3 in yeast (TRC40 in humans). Get3 delivers TA proteins to the Get1/2 complex for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. How Get1/2 mediates insertion of TMDs of TA proteins into the membrane is poorly understood. Using bulk fluorescence and microfluidics assays, we show that Get1/2 forms an aqueous channel in reconstituted bilayers. We estimate the channel diameter to be ∼2.5 nm wide, corresponding to the circumference of two Get1/2 complexes. We find that the Get3 binding can seal the Get1/2 channel, which dynamically opens and closes. Our mutation analysis further shows that the Get1/2 channel activity is required to release TA proteins from Get3 for insertion into the membrane. Hence, we propose that the Get1/2 channel functions as an insertase for insertion of TMDs and as a translocase for translocation of C-terminal hydrophilic segments.

Here, we identify gene-regulatory landscapes in a wide breadth of functional and dysfunctional CD8+ TIL states covering four cancer entities using single-cell chromatin profiling. We map enhancer-promoter interactions in human TILs by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility with single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor-entity-matching samples and prioritize cell-state-specific genes by super-enhancer analysis. Besides revealing entity-specific chromatin remodeling in exhausted TILs, our analyses identify a common chromatin trajectory to TIL dysfunction and determine key enhancers, transcriptional regulators, and deregulated genes involved in this process. Finally, we validate enhancer regulation at immunotherapeutically relevant loci by targeting non-coding regulatory elements with potent CRISPR activators and repressors. In summary, our study provides a framework for understanding and manipulating cell-state-specific gene-regulatory cues from human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs), the precursors of sperm and eggs, are specified during weeks 2−3 after fertilization. Few studies on ex vivo and in vitro cultured human embryos reported plausible hPGCs on embryonic day (E) 12−13 and in an E16−17 gastrulating embryo. In vitro, hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) can be specified from the intermediary pluripotent stage or peri-gastrulation precursors. Here, we explore the broad spectrum of hPGCLC precursors and how different precursors impact hPGCLC development. We show that resetting precursors can give rise to hPGCLCs (rhPGCLCs) in response to BMP. Strikingly, rhPGCLCs co-cultured with human hindgut organoids progress at a pace reminiscent of in vivo hPGC development, unlike those derived from peri-gastrulation precursors. Moreover, rhPGCLC specification depends on both EOMES and TBXT, not just on EOMES as for peri-gastrulation hPGCLCs. Importantly, our study provides the foundation for developing efficient in vitro models of human gametogenesis.

Abstract: Objectives
Melanoma progression involves multiple molecular pathways. In this study, we explored the effect of immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) on melanoma progression.
Methods
IGHG1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 tau variant (CSTF2T) expression levels were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously injected with A375 cells to develop a transplantation tumor model, 4 weeks after which the tumor tissues were collected. Cell proliferation, cell invasion, and cell migration of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells were measured after gain- and loss-of-function of IGHG1, ZEB1, and CSTF2T. Binding of ZEB1 to the IGHG1 promoter was assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays, while binding of CSTF2T to ZEB1 mRNA was investigated by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays.
Results
IGHG1, ZEB1, and CSTF2T were all highly expressed in human melanoma cell lines. In A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells, ZEB1 binds directly to the IGHG1 promoter. ZEB1 silencing reduced IGHG1 expression and melanoma cell proliferative, invasive, and migratory properties, and these cellular effects were nullified by overexpression of IGHG1. CSTF2T binds directly to ZEB1 mRNA. Silencing of CSTF2T diminished ZEB1 expression and restrained melanoma cell proliferative, invasive, and migratory capabilities. The impacts of CSTF2T silencing on melanoma cells were counteracted by concomitant overexpression of ZEB1. CSTF2T knockdown reduced tumor volume and weight in nude mice.
Conclusions
The CSTF2T–ZEB1–IGHG1 axis promotes melanoma cell proliferation and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
CCR7-triggered DC migration toward draining lymph nodes is critical for the initiation of protective immunity and maintenance of immune tolerance. How to promote CCR7-mediated DC migration to determine T cell responses under inflammatory and homeostatic conditions remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the Extl1 (Exostosin like glycosyltransferase 1) promotes CCR7-triggered DC migration in a heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Extl1 mediates HSPG production via its glycosyltransferase domain to inhibit C1q expression. Extl1/HSPG axis relieves C1q-mediated restriction of CCR7 surface expression and internalization, and thus enhances CCR7-dependent migratory signaling activation. Consequently, Extl1 is required for DC-mediated Th1 and Th17 responses in immune defense against bacterial infection and for Treg cell development in the prevention of autoimmunity. Our study adds mechanistic insights to the regulation of CCR7-triggered DC migration in immunity and tolerance and provides a potential target for the treatment of infectious and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are heterogeneous in shape, composition, and dynamics. Despite this diversity, VAP proteins act as receptors for multiple FFAT motif-containing proteins and drive the formation of most MCSs that involve the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the VAP-FFAT interaction is well characterized, no model explains how VAP adapts to its partners in various MCSs. We report that VAP-A localization to different MCSs depends on its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in human cells. VAP-A interaction with PTPIP51 and VPS13A at ER-mitochondria MCS conditions mitochondria fusion by promoting lipid transfer and cardiolipin buildup. VAP-A also enables lipid exchange at ER-Golgi MCS by interacting with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and CERT. However, removing IDRs from VAP-A restricts its distribution and function to ER-mitochondria MCS. Our data suggest that IDRs do not modulate VAP-A preference toward specific partners but do adjust their geometry to MCS organization and lifetime constraints. Thus, IDR-mediated VAP-A conformational flexibility ensures membrane tethering plasticity and efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Anterior-posterior axis formation regulated by the distal visceral endoderm (DVE) and anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) is essential for peri-implantation embryogenesis. However, the principles of the origin and specialization of DVE and AVE remain elusive. Here, with single-cell transcriptome analysis and pseudotime prediction, we show that DVE and AVE independently originate from the specialized primary endoderm in mouse blastocysts. Along distinct developmental paths, these two lineages, respectively, undergo four representative states with stage-specific transcriptional patterns around implantation. Further comparative analysis shows that AVE, but not DVE, is detected in human and non-human primate embryos, defining differences in polarity formation across species. Moreover, stem cell-assembled human blastoids lack DVE or AVE precursors, implying that additional induction of stem cells with DVE/AVE potential could promote the current embryo-like models and their post-implantation growth. Our work provides insight into understanding of embryonic polarity formation and early mammalian development.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have revealed that fast methyl sidechain dynamics can report on entropically-driven allostery. Yet, NMR applications have been largely limited to the super-microsecond motional regimes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We use 13Cε-methionine chemical shift-based global order parameters to test if ligands affect the fast dynamics of a thermostabilized GPCR, neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1). We establish that the NTS1 solution ensemble includes substates with lifetimes on several, discrete timescales. The longest-lived states reflect those captured in agonist- and inverse agonist-bound crystal structures, separated by large energy barriers. We observe that the rapid fluctuations of individual methionine residues, superimposed on these long-lived states, respond collectively with the degree of fast, global dynamics correlating with ligand pharmacology. This approach lends confidence to interpreting spectra in terms of local structure and methyl dihedral angle geometry. The results suggest a role for sub-microsecond dynamics and conformational entropy in GPCR ligand discrimination.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is central to inducing antiviral innate immunity. However, the mechanisms for IFN-I signaling self-regulation are still largely unknown. Here, we report that RNA virus-infected macrophages with UBE2M deficiency produced decreased IFN-I expression in a RIG-I-dependent manner, causing an aggravated viral infection. Mechanistically, UBE2M inhibits RIG-I degradation by preventing the interaction of RIG-I and E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in antiviral IFN-I signaling activation. Simultaneously, IFN-I signaling-activated STAT1 facilitates the transcription of Trim21, leading to increased UBE2M degradation and blunted antiviral immunity. Translationally, oral administration of milk-derived extracellular vesicles containing RING domain-truncated TRIM21 (TRIM21-ΔRING) lacking E3 ligase activity efficiently transfers TRIM21-ΔRING into macrophages. TRIM21-ΔRING suppresses UBE2M degradation by competitively binding to UBE2M with TRIM21, thereby enhancing antiviral immunity. Overall, we reveal a negative feedback loop of IFN-I signaling and develop a reagent to improve innate immunity against RNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Endocytic vesicular trafficking requires merging of two lipid bilayers, but how the two lipid bilayers can come close together during fusion and fission in endocytic trafficking is not well explored. Here, we establish that knocking down nonmuscle myosin IIs (NM IIs) by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibition of their activities by (−) blebbistatin causes the formation of a ring-like assembly of early endosomes (raEE). Inhibition of NM II assembly by an inhibitor of regulatory light-chain (RLC) kinase results in the formation of raEE, whereas inhibition of NM II disassembly by inhibitors of heavy chain kinases, protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase 2 (CK2), causes the dispersion of early endosomes. The raEEs retain EEA1, Rab7, and LAMP2 markers. Overexpression of an assembly incompetent form, RLC-AA, and disassembly incompetent form, NMHCIIB-S6A or NMHCIIA-1916A, induces such defects, respectively. Altogether, these data support that NM II assembly and disassembly dynamics participate in endocytic trafficking by regulating fission to maintain the size of early endosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS) is a neurocutaneous disorder caused by somatic gain-of-function mutations in KRAS or HRAS. LNSS brains have neurodevelopmental defects, including cerebral defects and epilepsy; however, its pathological mechanism and potentials for treatment are largely unclear. We show that introduction of KRASG12V in the developing mouse cortex results in subcortical nodular heterotopia and enhanced excitability, recapitulating major pathological manifestations of LNSS. Moreover, we show that decreased firing frequency of inhibitory neurons without KRASG12V expression leads to disrupted excitation and inhibition balance. Transcriptional profiling after destabilization domain-mediated clearance of KRASG12V in human neural progenitors and differentiating neurons identifies reversible functional networks underlying LNSS. Neurons expressing KRASG12V show molecular changes associated with delayed neuronal maturation, most of which are restored by KRASG12V clearance. These findings provide insights into the molecular networks underlying the reversibility of some of the neuropathologies observed in LNSS caused by dysregulation of the RAS pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can produce durable responses against cancer. We and others have found that a subset of patients experiences paradoxical rapid cancer progression during immunotherapy. It is poorly understood how tumors can accelerate their progression during ICB. In some preclinical models, ICB causes hyperprogressive disease (HPD). While immune exclusion drives resistance to ICB, counterintuitively, patients with HPD and complete response (CR) following ICB manifest comparable levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and interferon γ (IFNγ) gene signature. Interestingly, patients with HPD but not CR exhibit elevated tumoral fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and β-catenin signaling. In animal models, T cell-derived IFNγ promotes tumor FGF2 signaling, thereby suppressing PKM2 activity and decreasing NAD+, resulting in reduction of SIRT1-mediated β-catenin deacetylation and enhanced β-catenin acetylation, consequently reprograming tumor stemness. Targeting the IFNγ-PKM2-β-catenin axis prevents HPD in preclinical models. Thus, the crosstalk of core immunogenic, metabolic, and oncogenic pathways via the IFNγ-PKM2-β-catenin cascade underlies ICB-associated HPD.

Abstract: Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) is a shrub used to treat hepatic, intestinal, renal, respiratory, and reproductive failures. Etoposide a plant-based compound derived from Podophyllum pelltatum, has been used for human malignancies treatment. However, it induces testis, and hepatic failures. In the present study, impact of rosemary essential oil against testis failure, lipid parameters, and hepatic enzymes in male rats has been studied. Forty male Wistar albino rats were grouped in a completely randomized design with Etoposide injection (ETO), rosemary supplementation (ROS), with Etoposide injection and rosemary supplement (ETO+ROS), and control rats with no Etoposide injection and no rosemary (CON). The experiment lasted for seven consecutive weeks including one week as acclimatization time. At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and blood samples were analyzed for serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), total Protein (TP), glucose (GLU) and testosterone. The left testis was harvested for histological examination. Results showed that rats with Etoposide injection had higher ALT, AST, and ALP the control rats. No significant difference was found among treatments in terms of glucose concentration in blood. Rosemary supplemntaion decreased cholesterol and TG concentration and increased HDL concentration in male rats. Furthermore, administration of rosemary essential oil increased blood testosterone but decreased ALT and AST. The epithelial height of seminiferous tubules was decreased significantly in ET as compared with CON. Rosemary essential oil lessened the adverse effect of Etopside on epithelial height in rat testis as it is shown in ET+ROS. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of rosemary essential oil alleviated liver toxicity and functional testis damage induced by Etopside.

Abstract: Summary
Patients affected by colorectal cancer (CRC) with DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), often respond to immune checkpoint blockade therapies, while those with mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) tumors generally do not. Interestingly, a subset of MMRp CRCs contains variable fractions of MMRd cells, but it is unknown how their presence impacts immune surveillance. We asked whether modulation of the MMRd fraction in MMR heterogeneous tumors acts as an endogenous cancer vaccine by promoting immune surveillance. To test this hypothesis, we use isogenic MMRp (Mlh1+/+) and MMRd (Mlh1−/−) mouse CRC cells. MMRp/MMRd cells mixed at different ratios are injected in immunocompetent mice and tumor rejection is observed when at least 50% of cells are MMRd. To enrich the MMRd fraction, MMRp/MMRd tumors are treated with 6-thioguanine, which leads to tumor rejection. These results suggest that genetic and pharmacological modulation of the DNA mismatch repair machinery potentiate the immunogenicity of MMR heterogeneous tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Ancient genomics can directly detect human genetic adaptation to environmental cues. However, it remains unclear how pathogens have exerted selective pressures on human genome diversity across different epochs and affected present-day inflammatory disease risk. Here, we use an ancestry-aware approximate Bayesian computation framework to estimate the nature, strength, and time of onset of selection acting on 2,879 ancient and modern European genomes from the last 10,000 years. We found that the bulk of genetic adaptation occurred after the start of the Bronze Age, <4,500 years ago, and was enriched in genes relating to host-pathogen interactions. Furthermore, we detected directional selection acting on specific leukocytic lineages and experimentally demonstrated that the strongest negatively selected candidate variant in immunity genes, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) D283G, is hypomorphic. Finally, our analyses suggest that the risk of inflammatory disorders has increased in post-Neolithic Europeans, possibly because of antagonistic pleiotropy following genetic adaptation to pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Membraneless condensates, such as stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies), have attracted wide attention due to their unique feature of rapid response to stress without first requiring nuclear feedback. In this study, we identify diaphanous-related formin 3 (DIAPH3), an actin nucleator, as a scaffold protein to initiate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form abundant cytosolic phase-separated DIAPH3 granules (D-granules) in mammalian cells such as HeLa, HEK293, and fibroblasts under various stress conditions. Neither mRNAs nor known stress-associated condensate markers, such as G3BP1, G3BP2, and TIA1 for SGs and DCP1A for P-bodies, are detected in D-granules. Using overexpression and knockout of DIAPH3, pharmacological interventions, and optogenetics, we further demonstrate that stress-induced D-granules spatially sequester DIAPH3 within the condensation to inhibit the assembly of actin filaments in filopodia. This study reveals that D-granules formed by LLPS act as a regulatory hub for actin cytoskeletal remodeling in response to stress.

Abstract: Summary
Microproteins (MPs) are a potentially rich source of uncharacterized metabolic regulators. Here, we use ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to curate 3,877 unannotated MP-encoding small ORFs (smORFs) in primary brown, white, and beige mouse adipocytes. Of these, we validated 85 MPs by proteomics, including 33 circulating MPs in mouse plasma. Analyses of MP-encoding mRNAs under different physiological conditions (high-fat diet) revealed that numerous MPs are regulated in adipose tissue in vivo and are co-expressed with established metabolic genes. Furthermore, Ribo-seq provided evidence for the translation of Gm8773, which encodes a secreted MP that is homologous to human and chicken FAM237B. Gm8773 is highly expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant mFAM237B showed orexigenic activity in obese mice. Together, these data highlight the value of this adipocyte MP database in identifying MPs with roles in fundamental metabolic and physiological processes such as feeding.

In adipose tissues, a comparative analysis revealed ethnically conserved cell-type signatures and two adipocyte subtype-enriched modules with opposite insulin sensitivity responses. The modules enriched for adipose stem and progenitor cells as well as immune cells showed negative correlations with insulin sensitivity. In muscle tissues, the modules enriched for stem cells and fibro-adipogenic progenitors responded to insulin sensitivity oppositely. The adipocyte and muscle fiber-enriched modules shared cellular-respiration-related genes but had tissue-specific rearrangements of gene regulations in response to insulin sensitivity. Integration of the gene co-expression and causal networks further pinpointed key drivers of insulin resistance. Together, this study revealed the cell-type-specific transcriptomic networks and signaling maps underlying insulin resistance in major glucose-responsive tissues. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the consequences of individual transcriptome variation is fundamental to deciphering human biology and disease. We implement a statistical framework to quantify the contributions of 21 individual traits as drivers of gene expression and alternative splicing variation across 46 human tissues and 781 individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We demonstrate that ancestry, sex, age, and BMI make additive and tissue-specific contributions to expression variability, whereas interactions are rare. Variation in splicing is dominated by ancestry and is under genetic control in most tissues, with ribosomal proteins showing a strong enrichment of tissue-shared splicing events. Our analyses reveal a systemic contribution of types 1 and 2 diabetes to tissue transcriptome variation with the strongest signal in the nerve, where histopathology image analysis identifies novel genes related to diabetic neuropathy. Our multi-tissue and multi-trait approach provides an extensive characterization of the main drivers of human transcriptome variation in health and disease.

Abstract: Spermatogenesis is a complicated process that includes spermatogonia differentiation, spermatocytes meiosis, spermatids spermiogenesis and final release of spermatozoa. Actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) are two actin binding proteins that regulate cell adhesion in seminiferous tubules during mammalian spermatogenesis. However, the functions of these two proteins during spermatogenesis in nonmammalian species, especially Crustacea, are still unknown. Here, we cloned es-Arp3 and es-Eps8 from the testis of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. es-Arp3 and es-Eps8 were located in spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa. Knockdown of es-Arp3 and es-Eps8 in vivo caused morphological changes to seminiferous tubules including delayed spermatozoa release, shedding of germ cells and vacuoles. Filamentous-actin (F-actin) filaments network was disorganized due to deficiency of es-Arp3 and es-Eps8. Accompanying this, four junctional proteins (α-catenin, β-catenin, pinin and ZO1) displayed abnormal expression levels as well as penetrating biotin signals in seminiferous tubules. We also used the Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK666 to block es-Arp3 activity and supported es-Arp3 knockdown results. In summary, our study demonstrated for the first time that es-Arp3 and es-Eps8 are important for spermatogenesis via regulating microfilament-mediated cell adhesion in Eriocheir sinensis.

Abstract: Summary
While saliva regulates the interplay between the microbiota and the oral immune system, the mechanisms establishing postnatal salivary immunity are ill-defined. Here, we show that high levels of neutrophils and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-transferred maternal IgG are temporarily present in the neonatal murine salivary glands in a microbiota-independent manner. During weaning, neutrophils, FcRn, and IgG decrease in the salivary glands, while the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is upregulated in a growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6)-dependent manner independent of the microbiota. Production of salivary IgA begins following weaning and relies on CD4-help, IL-17, and the microbiota. The weaning phase is characterized by a transient accumulation of dendritic cells capable of migrating from the oral mucosa to the salivary glands upon exposure to microbial challenges and activating T cells. This study reveals the postnatal mechanisms developed in the salivary glands to induce immunity and proposes the salivary glands as an immune inductive site.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins are secreted from cells to send information to neighboring cells or distant tissues. Because of the highly integrated nature of energy balance systems, there has been particular interest in myokines and adipokines. These are challenging to study through proteomics because serum or plasma contains highly abundant proteins that limit the detection of proteins with lower abundance. We show here that extracellular fluid (EF) from muscle and fat tissues of mice shows a different protein composition than either serum or tissues. Mass spectrometry analyses of EFs from mice with physiological perturbations, like exercise or cold exposure, allowed the quantification of many potentially novel myokines and adipokines. Using this approach, we identify prosaposin as a secreted product of muscle and fat. Prosaposin expression stimulates thermogenic gene expression and induces mitochondrial respiration in primary fat cells. These studies together illustrate the utility of EF isolation as a discovery tool for adipokines and myokines.

Abstract: Summary
The categorization of animal vocalizations into distinct behaviorally relevant groups for communication is an essential operation that must be performed by the auditory system. This auditory object recognition is a difficult task that requires selectivity to the group identifying acoustic features and invariance to renditions within each group. We find that small ensembles of auditory neurons in the forebrain of a social songbird can code the bird’s entire vocal repertoire (∼10 call types). Ensemble neural discrimination is not, however, correlated with single unit selectivity, but instead with how well the joint single unit tunings to characteristic spectro-temporal modulations span the acoustic subspace optimized for the discrimination of call types. Thus, akin to face recognition in the visual system, call type recognition in the auditory system is based on a sparse code representing a small number of high-level features and not on highly selective grandmother neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The UCLA ATLAS Community Health Initiative (ATLAS) has an initial target to recruit 150,000 participants from across the UCLA Health system with the goal of creating a genomic database to accelerate precision medicine efforts in California. This initiative includes a biobank embedded within the UCLA Health system that comprises de-identified genomic data linked to electronic health records (EHRs). The first freeze of data from September 2020 contains 27,987 genotyped samples imputed to 7.9 million SNPs across the genome and is linked with de-identified versions of the EHRs from UCLA Health. Here, we describe a centralized repository of the genotype data and provide tools and pipelines to perform genome- and phenome-wide association studies across a wide range of EHR-derived phenotypes and genetic ancestry groups. We demonstrate the utility of this resource through the analysis of 7 well-studied traits and recapitulate many previous genetic and phenotypic associations.

Abstract: Summary
Theta sequences and phase precession shape hippocampal activity and are considered key underpinnings of memory formation. Theta sequences are sweeps of spikes from multiple cells, tracing trajectories from past to future. Phase precession is the correlation between theta firing phase and animal position. Here, we reconsider these temporal processes in CA1 and the computational principles that they are thought to obey. We find stronger heterogeneity than previously described: we identify cells that do not phase precess but reliably express theta sequences. Other cells phase precess only when medium gamma (linked to entorhinal inputs) is strongest. The same cells express more sequences, but not precession, when slow gamma (linked to CA3 inputs) dominates. Moreover, sequences occur independently in distinct cell groups. Our results challenge the view that phase precession is the mechanism underlying the emergence of theta sequences, suggesting a role for CA1 cells in multiplexing diverse computational processes.

Abstract: Summary
Immune development is profoundly influenced by vertically transferred cues. However, little is known about how maternal innate-like lymphocytes regulate offspring immunity. Here, we show that mice born from γδ T cell-deficient (TCRδ−/−) dams display an increase in first-breath-induced inflammation, with a pulmonary milieu selectively enriched in type 2 cytokines and type 2-polarized immune cells, when compared with the progeny of γδ T cell-sufficient dams. Upon helminth infection, mice born from TCRδ−/− dams sustain an increased type 2 inflammatory response. This is independent of the genotype of the pups. Instead, the offspring of TCRδ−/− dams harbors a distinct intestinal microbiota, acquired during birth and fostering, and decreased levels of intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as pentanoate and hexanoate. Importantly, exogenous SCFA supplementation inhibits type 2 innate lymphoid cell function and suppresses first-breath- and infection-induced inflammation. Taken together, our findings unravel a maternal γδ T cell-microbiota-SCFA axis regulating neonatal lung immunity.

Abstract: Cytokines are the most important inflammatory mediators and are well-known as the main cause of emphysema. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) as a cell-based treatment strategy could play a pivotal role in lung regeneration through anti-inflammatory and paracrine properties. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to the comparison of inflammation markers' improvement in response to the intratracheal and systemic delivery method of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in emphysema. Forty-eight rats were divided into five groups including Control, Elastase (25 IU/kg, Intratracheal, at day first and 10th), Elastase+PBS, Intratracheal cell therapy (1 ×107, at day 28th), and Systemic cell therapy groups (1 ×107, Jugular vein, at day 28th). After 3 weeks, the blood gas analysis (PO2, PCO2 and pH), fibrinogen level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured in all groups. In addition, inflammatory genes expression, and concentration levels of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and TGF-β,) were evaluated using Real-time PCR and Elisa kits, respectively. The statistical analysis of our data shows that local administration leads to more significant treatment efficacy with decreased inflammation parameters such as WBC count and pro-inflammatory cytokines in comparison with systemic treatment. Besides, these results were approved by more reduction of CRP and fibrinogen concentration levels in blood samples of intra-tracheal AMSCs-treated rats compare with the systemic group. Moreover, the improvement in histopathology indexes of the local administrated group was significantly better than the systemic group. Accordingly, the obtained results suggest local administration as the most efficacious route for mesenchymal stem cells delivery in patients with emphysema.

Abstract: Summary
Palmoplantar skin is structurally and functionally unique, but the transcriptional programs driving this specialization are unclear. Here, we use bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of human palm, sole, and hip skin to describe the distinguishing characteristics of palmoplantar and non-palmoplantar skin while also uncovering differences between palmar and plantar sites. Our approach reveals an altered immune environment in palmoplantar skin, with downregulation of diverse immunological processes and decreased immune cell populations. Further, we identify specific fibroblast populations that appear to orchestrate key differences in cell-cell communication in palm, sole, and hip. Dedicated keratinocyte analysis highlights major differences in basal cell fraction among the three sites and demonstrates the existence of two spinous keratinocyte populations constituting parallel, site-selective epidermal differentiation trajectories. In summary, this deep characterization of highly adapted palmoplantar skin contributes key insights into the fundamental biology of human skin and provides a valuable data resource for further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
Detecting genetic variants in metagenomic data is a priority for understanding the evolution, ecology, and functional characteristics of microbial communities. Many tools that perform this metagenotyping rely on aligning reads of unknown origin to a database of sequences from many species before calling variants. In this synthesis, we investigate how databases of increasingly diverse and closely related species have pushed the limits of current alignment algorithms, thereby degrading the performance of metagenotyping tools. We identify multi-mapping reads as a prevalent source of errors and illustrate a trade-off between retaining correct alignments versus limiting incorrect alignments, many of which map reads to the wrong species. Then we evaluate several actionable mitigation strategies and review emerging methods showing promise to further improve metagenotyping in response to the rapid growth in genome collections. Our results have implications beyond metagenotyping to the many tools in microbial genomics that depend upon accurate read mapping.

Abstract: Summary
NLRP1 and CARD8 are related pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect intracellular danger signals and form inflammasomes. Both undergo autoproteolysis, generating N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) fragments. The proteasome-mediated degradation of the NT releases the CT from autoinhibition, but the stimuli that trigger NT degradation have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that several distinct agents that interfere with protein folding, including aminopeptidase inhibitors, chaperone inhibitors, and inducers of the unfolded protein response, accelerate NT degradation. However, these agents alone do not trigger inflammasome formation because the released CT fragments are physically sequestered by the serine dipeptidase DPP9. We show that DPP9-binding ligands must also be present to disrupt these complexes and allow the CT fragments to oligomerize into inflammasomes. Overall, these results indicate that NLRP1 and CARD8 detect a specific perturbation that induces both protein folding stress and DPP9 ligand accumulation.

Abstract: Summary
Biobanks of linked clinical patient histories and biological samples are an efficient strategy to generate large cohorts for modern genetics research. Biobank recruitment varies by factors such as geographic catchment and sampling strategy, which affect biobank demographics and research utility. Here, we describe the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a single-health-system biobank currently consisting of >91,000 participants recruited primarily during surgical encounters at Michigan Medicine. The surgical enrollment results in a biobank enriched for many diseases and ideally suited for a disease genetics cohort. Compared with the much larger population-based UK Biobank, MGI has higher prevalence for nearly all diagnosis-code-based phenotypes and larger absolute case counts for many phenotypes. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) results replicate known findings, thereby validating the genetic and clinical data. Our results illustrate that opportunistic biobank sampling within single health systems provides a unique and complementary resource for exploring the genetics of complex diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Immune sentinel macrophages initiate responses to pathogens via hundreds of immune response genes. Each immune threat demands a tailored response, suggesting that the capacity for stimulus-specific gene expression is a key functional hallmark of healthy macrophages. To quantify this property, termed “stimulus-response specificity” (SRS), we developed a single-cell experimental workflow and analytical approaches based on information theory and machine learning. We found that the response specificity of macrophages is driven by combinations of specific immune genes that show low cell-to-cell heterogeneity and are targets of separate signaling pathways. The “response specificity profile,” a systematic comparison of multiple stimulus-response distributions, was distinctly altered by polarizing cytokines, and it enabled an assessment of the functional state of macrophages. Indeed, the response specificity profile of peritoneal macrophages from old and obese mice showed characteristic differences, suggesting that SRS may be a basis for measuring the functional state of innate immune cells. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
The transfer of endocytosed cargoes to lysosomes (LYSs) requires HOPS, a multiprotein complex that tethers late endosomes (LEs) to LYSs before fusion. Many proteins interact with HOPS on LEs/LYSs. However, it is not clear whether these HOPS interactors localize to LEs or LYSs or how they participate in tethering. Here, we biochemically characterized endosomes purified from untreated or experimentally manipulated cells to put HOPS and interacting proteins in order and to establish their functional interdependence. Our results assign Rab2a and Rab7 to LEs and Arl8 and BORC to LYSs and show that HOPS drives LE-LYS fusion by bridging late endosomal Rab2a with lysosomal BORC-anchored Arl8. We further show that Rab7 is absent from sites of HOPS-dependent tethering but promotes fusion by moving LEs toward LYSs via dynein. Thus, our study identifies the topology of the machinery for LE-LYS tethering and elucidates the role of different small GTPases in the process.

Abstract: Summary
Clustering cells based on their high-dimensional profiles is an important data reduction process by which researchers infer distinct cellular states. The advent of cellular barcoding, however, provides an alternative means by which to group cells: by their clonal origin. We developed ClonoCluster, a computational method that combines both clone and transcriptome information to create hybrid clusters that weight both kinds of data with a tunable parameter. We generated hybrid clusters across six independent datasets and found that ClonoCluster generated qualitatively different clusters in all cases. The markers of these hybrid clusters were different but had equivalent fidelity to transcriptome-only clusters. The genes most strongly associated with the rearrangements in hybrid clusters were ribosomal function and extracellular matrix genes. We also developed the complementary tool Warp Factor that incorporates clone information in popular 2D visualization techniques like UMAP. Integrating ClonoCluster and Warp Factor revealed biologically relevant markers of cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
Melanin is a pigment produced from the amino acid L-tyrosine in melanosomes. The CNC-family transcription factor Nrf3 is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis, where melanocytes reside, but its melanogenic function is unclear. Here, we show that Nrf3 regulates macropinocytosis and autophagy to coordinate melanogenesis cascade. In response to an exogenous inducer of melanin production, forskolin, Nrf3 upregulates the core melanogenic gene circuit, which includes Mitf, Tyr, Tyrp1, Pmel, and Oca2. Furthermore, Nrf3 induces the gene expression of Cln3, an autophagosome-related factor, for melanin precursor uptake by macropinocytosis. Ulk2 and Gabarapl2 are also identified as Nrf3-target autophagosome-related genes for melanosome formation. In parallel, Nrf3 prompts autolysosomal melanosome degradation for melanocyte survival. An endogenous melanogenic inducer αMSH also activates Nrf3-mediated melanin production, whereas it is suppressed by an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, nelfinavir. These findings indicate the significant role of Nrf3 in the melanogenesis and the anti-melanogenic potential of nelfinavir.

In the thalamus, axons from the two eyes initially overlap in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and undergo activity-dependent competition to segregate into target domains. Here, we combine eye-specific tract tracing with volumetric super-resolution imaging to measure the nanoscale molecular reorganization of developing retinogeniculate eye-specific synapses in the mouse brain. We show there are eye-specific differences in presynaptic vesicle pool size and vesicle association with the active zone at the earliest stages of retinogeniculate refinement but find no evidence of eye-specific differences in subsynaptic domain number, size, or transsynaptic alignment across development. Genetic disruption of spontaneous retinal activity decreases retinogeniculate synapse density, delays the emergence eye-specific differences in vesicle organization, and disrupts subsynaptic domain maturation. These results suggest that activity-dependent eye-specific presynaptic maturation underlies synaptic competition in the mammalian visual system.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial colonization plays an instrumental role in the health of the host. However, the host factors that facilitate the establishment of the microbial colonization remain unclear. Here, we establish a screening method to identify host factors regulating E. coli colonization in C. elegans. We find that a BCF-1 possessing N-glycosylation promotes E. coli colonization by directly binding to E. coli via its fimbrial protein, YdeR. BCF-1 is activated by the bacteria and interacts with an oligosaccharyl transferase, OSTB-1, which is critical for regulating E. coli colonization. We also show that the N-glycosylation of BCF-1 is critical for E. coli colonization. In addition, we find that the microbiota composition is shaped by BCF-1. In summary, this study shows a “scaffold model” for bacterial colonization between a host glycoprotein and E. coli, and it also introduces a powerful research approach to identify individual host factors involved in modulating bacterial colonization.

Abstract: Summary
The synapsis of DNA ends is a critical step for the repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This is performed by a multicomponent protein complex assembled around Ku70-Ku80 heterodimers and regulated by accessory factors, including long non-coding RNAs, through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we use magnetic tweezers to investigate the contributions of core NHEJ proteins and APLF and lncRNA NIHCOLE to DNA synapsis. APLF stabilizes DNA end bridging and, together with Ku70-Ku80, establishes a minimal complex that supports DNA synapsis for several minutes under piconewton forces. We find the C-terminal acidic region of APLF to be critical for bridging. NIHCOLE increases the dwell time of the synapses by Ku70-Ku80 and APLF. This effect is further enhanced by a small and structured RNA domain within NIHCOLE. We propose a model where Ku70-Ku80 can simultaneously bind DNA, APLF, and structured RNAs to promote the stable joining of DNA ends.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pain is one of the most significant medical problems throughout the world. Recent evidence has confirmed the hippocampus as an active modulator of pain chronicity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we identify a neural ensemble in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) that shows inhibitory responses to noxious but not innocuous stimuli. Following peripheral inflammation, this ensemble becomes responsive to innocuous stimuli, representing hypersensitivity. Mimicking the inhibition of vCA1 neurons using chemogenetics induces chronic pain-like behaviors in naive mice, whereas activating vCA1 neurons in mice with peripheral inflammation results in a reduction of pain-related behaviors. Pathway-specific manipulation of vCA1 projections to basolateral amygdala (BLA) and infralimbic cortex (IL) shows that these pathways are differentially involved in pain modulation at different temporal stages of chronic inflammatory pain. These results confirm a crucial role of the vCA1 and its circuits in modulating the development of chronic pain.

Abstract: Summary
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is an opportunistic pathogen that uses the b-series gangliosides GD1b and GT1b as entry receptors. Here, we characterize the impact of naturally occurring VP1 mutations on ganglioside binding, VP1 protein structure, and virus tropism. Infectious entry of single mutants E73Q and E73A and the triple mutant A72V-E73Q-E82Q (VQQ) remains sialic acid dependent, and all three variants acquire binding to a-series gangliosides, including GD1a. However, the E73A and VQQ variants lose the ability to infect ganglioside-complemented cells, and this correlates with a clear shift of the BC2 loop in the crystal structures of E73A and VQQ. On the other hand, the K69N mutation in the K69N-E82Q variant leads to a steric clash that precludes sialic acid binding. Nevertheless, this mutant retains significant infectivity in 293TT cells, which is not dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans, implying that an unknown sialic acid-independent entry receptor for BKPyV exists.

Abstract: Summary
Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is an emerging behavioral nutrition intervention that involves a daily cycle of feeding and fasting. In both animals and humans, TRF has pleiotropic health benefits that arise from multiple organ systems, yet the molecular basis of TRF-mediated benefits is not well understood. Here, we subjected mice to isocaloric ad libitum feeding (ALF) or TRF of a western diet and examined gene expression changes in samples taken from 22 organs and brain regions collected every 2 h over a 24-h period. We discovered that TRF profoundly impacts gene expression. Nearly 80% of all genes show differential expression or rhythmicity under TRF in at least one tissue. Functional annotation of these changes revealed tissue- and pathway-specific impacts of TRF. These findings and resources provide a critical foundation for future mechanistic studies and will help to guide human time-restricted eating (TRE) interventions to treat various disease conditions with or without pharmacotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA double-strand break repair complex Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) detects and nucleolytically processes DNA ends, activates the ATM kinase, and tethers DNA at break sites. How MRN can act both as nuclease and scaffold protein is not well understood. The cryo-EM structure of MRN from Chaetomium thermophilum reveals a 2:2:1 complex with a single Nbs1 wrapping around the autoinhibited Mre11 nuclease dimer. MRN has two DNA-binding modes, one ATP-dependent mode for loading onto DNA ends and one ATP-independent mode through Mre11’s C terminus, suggesting how it may interact with DSBs and intact DNA. MRNs two 60-nm-long coiled-coil domains form a linear rod structure, the apex of which is assembled by the two joined zinc-hook motifs. Apices from two MRN complexes can further dimerize, forming 120-nm spanning MRN-MRN structures. Our results illustrate the architecture of MRN and suggest how it mechanistically integrates catalytic and tethering functions.

Abstract: Summary
Cervical cancer (CC) that is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) remains a significant public health problem worldwide. HPV integration sites can be silent or actively transcribed, leading to the production of viral-host fusion transcripts. Herein, we demonstrate that only productive HPV integration sites were nonrandomly distributed across both viral and host genomes, suggesting that productive integration sites are under selection and likely to contribute to CC pathophysiology. Furthermore, using large-scale, multi-omics (clinical, genomic, transcriptional, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and single-cell) data, we demonstrate that tumors with productive HPV integration are associated with higher E6/E7 proteins and enhanced tumor aggressiveness and immunoevasion. Importantly, productive HPV integration increases from carcinoma in situ to advanced disease. This study improves our understanding of the functional consequences of HPV fusion transcripts on the biology and pathophysiology of HPV-driven CCs, suggesting that productive HPV integration should be evaluated as an indicator of high risk for progression to aggressive cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Taxon-specific proteins are key determinants defining the biology of all organisms and represent prime drug targets in pathogens. However, lacking comparability with proteins in other lineages makes them particularly difficult to study. In malaria parasites, this is exacerbated by technical limitations. Here, we analyzed the cellular location, essentiality, function, and, in selected cases, interactome of all unknown non-secretory proteins encoded on an entire P. falciparum chromosome. The nucleus was the most common localization, indicating that it is a hotspot of parasite-specific biology. More in-depth functional studies with four proteins revealed essential roles in DNA replication and mitosis. The mitosis proteins defined a possible orphan complex and a highly diverged complex needed for spindle-kinetochore connection. Structure-function comparisons indicated that the taxon-specific proteins evolved by different mechanisms. This work demonstrates the feasibility of gene-by-gene screens to elucidate the biology of malaria parasites and reveal critical parasite-specific processes of interest as drug targets.

Abstract: Summary
Cell type-specific transcriptional differences between brain tissues from donors with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and unaffected controls have been well documented, but few studies have rigorously interrogated the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these alterations. We performed single nucleus multiomics (snRNA-seq plus snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP expression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and microglia, respectively. Microglia links were globally enriched for heritability of AD risk and previously identified active regulatory regions.

Abstract: Summary
During translation of the genomic RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus in the COVID-19 pandemic, host ribosomes undergo programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at a conserved structural element. Although PRF is essential for coronavirus replication, host factors that regulate this process have not yet been identified. Here we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify regulators of SARS-CoV-2 PRF. These screens reveal that loss of ribosome recycling factors markedly decreases frameshifting efficiency and impairs SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Mutational studies support a model wherein efficient removal of ribosomal subunits at the ORF1a stop codon is required for frameshifting of trailing ribosomes. This dependency upon ribosome recycling is not observed with other non-pathogenic human betacoronaviruses and is likely due to the unique position of the ORF1a stop codon in the SARS clade of coronaviruses. These findings therefore uncover host factors that support efficient SARS-CoV-2 translation and replication.

Abstract: In this brief review, we discuss the factors that modulate the quantum size and the kinetics of exocytosis. We also discuss the determinants which motivate the type of exocytosis from the so-called kiss-and-run to full fusion and along the intermediate mode of partial release. Kiss-and-run release comprises the transient opening of a nanometer (approx. 2 nm diameter) fusion pore between vesicle and plasma membrane allowing a small amount of release. Partial release comprises a larger more extended opening of the pore to allow a larger fraction of released vesicle content and is what is observed as normal full release in most electrochemical measurements. Partial release appears to be dominant in dense core vesicles and perhaps synaptic vesicles. The concept of partial release leads to the fraction released as a plastic component of exocytosis. Partial vesicular distension and the kinetics of exocytosis can be modulated by second messengers, physiological modulators, and drugs. This concept adds a novel point of regulation for the exocytotic process.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis requires molecular regulators that tailor mitochondrial bioenergetics to the needs of protein folding. For instance, calnexin maintains mitochondria metabolism and mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) through reactive oxygen species (ROS) from NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). However, induction of ER stress requires a quick molecular rewiring of mitochondria to adapt to new energy needs. This machinery is not characterized. We now show that the oxidoreductase ERO1⍺ covalently interacts with protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) upon treatment with tunicamycin. The PERK-ERO1⍺ interaction requires the C-terminal active site of ERO1⍺ and cysteine 216 of PERK. Moreover, we show that the PERK-ERO1⍺ complex promotes oxidization of MERC proteins and controls mitochondrial dynamics. Using proteinaceous probes, we determined that these functions improve ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux to maintain bioenergetics in both organelles, while limiting oxidative stress. Therefore, the PERK-ERO1⍺ complex is a key molecular machinery that allows quick metabolic adaptation to ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the MECP2 gene underlie a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, most commonly Rett syndrome (RTT). We ask whether MECP2 mutations interfere with human astrocyte developmental maturation, thereby affecting their ability to support neurons. Using human-based models, we show that RTT-causing MECP2 mutations greatly impact the key role of astrocytes in regulating overall brain bioenergetics and that these metabolic aberrations are likely mediated by dysfunctional mitochondria. During post-natal maturation, astrocytes rely on neurons to induce their complex stellate morphology and transcriptional changes. While MECP2 mutations cause cell-intrinsic aberrations in the astrocyte transcriptional landscape, surprisingly, they do not affect the neuron-induced astrocyte gene expression. Notably, however, astrocytes are unable to develop complex mature morphology due to cell- and non-cell-autonomous aberrations caused by MECP2 mutations. Thus, MECP2 mutations critically impact key cellular and molecular features of human astrocytes and, hence, their ability to interact and support the structural and functional maturation of neurons.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a patient haploinsufficient for the neuronal RNA binding protein NOVA1 who developed a behavioral motor hyperactivity disorder, suggesting a role of NOVA1 in postnatal motor inhibition. To investigate Nova1’s action in adult Gad2+ inhibitory neurons, we generated a conditional Nova1-null mouse (Nova1-cKOGad2-cre). Strikingly, the phenotypes of these mice show many similarities to the NOVA1 haploinsufficient patient and identify a function of Nova1 in the hypothalamus. Molecularly, Nova1 loss in Gad2-positive neurons alters downstream expression of Impact mRNA, along with a subset of RNAs encoding electron transport chain-related factors and ribosomal proteins. NOVA1 stabilizes Impact mRNA by binding its 3′ UTR, antagonizing the actions of miR-138 and miR-124. Together, these studies demonstrate actions of NOVA1 in adult hypothalamic neurons, mechanisms by which it functions in translation and metabolism, including through direct binding to Impact mRNA, and illuminate its role in human neurologic disease.

Abstract: Summary
The role of MDC1 in the DNA damage response has been extensively studied; however, its impact on other cellular processes is not well understood. Here, we describe the role of MDC1 in transcription as a regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Depletion of MDC1 causes a genome-wide reduction in the abundance of actively engaged RNAPII elongation complexes throughout the gene body of protein-encoding genes under unperturbed conditions. Decreased engaged RNAPII subsequently alters the assembly of the spliceosome complex on chromatin, leading to changes in pre-mRNA splicing. Mechanistically, the S/TQ domain of MDC1 modulates RNAPII-mediated transcription. Upon genotoxic stress, MDC1 promotes the abundance of engaged RNAPII complexes at DNA breaks, thereby stimulating nascent transcription at the damaged sites. Of clinical relevance, cancer cells lacking MDC1 display hypersensitivity to RNAPII inhibitors. Overall, we unveil a role of MDC1 in RNAPII-mediated transcription with potential implications for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Leukocyte recruitment from the vasculature into tissues is a crucial component of the immune system but is also key to inflammatory disease. Chemokines are central to this process but have yet to be therapeutically targeted during inflammation due to a lack of mechanistic understanding. Specifically, CXCL4 (Platelet Factor 4, PF4) has no established receptor that explains its function. Here, we use biophysical, in vitro, and in vivo techniques to determine the mechanism underlying CXCL4-mediated leukocyte recruitment. We demonstrate that CXCL4 binds to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugars on proteoglycans within the endothelial extracellular matrix, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes to the vasculature, increased vascular permeability, and non-specific recruitment of a range of leukocytes. Furthermore, GAG sulfation confers selectivity onto chemokine localization. These findings present mechanistic insights into chemokine biology and provide future therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic metabolites serving as danger-associated molecular patterns play crucial roles in modulating the development, differentiation, and activity of innate immune cells. Yet, it is unclear how innate immune cells detect systemic metabolites for signal transmission. Here, we show that bile acids function as endogenous mitofusin 2 (MFN2) ligands and differentially modulate innate immune response to bacterial infection under cholestatic and physiological conditions. Bile acids at high concentrations promote mitochondrial tethering to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to calcium overload in the mitochondrion, which activates NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis. By contrast, at physiologically relevant low concentrations, bile acids promote mitochondrial fusion, leading to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and thereby strengthening infiltrated macrophages mediated phagocytotic clearance of bacteria. These findings support that bile acids, as endogenous activators of MFN2, are vital for tuning innate immune responses against infections, representing a causal link that connects systemic metabolism with mitochondrial dynamics in shaping innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of stem cells requires the concerted actions of niche-derived signals and stem cell-intrinsic factors. Although Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a Drosophila bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) molecule, can act as a long-range morphogen, its function is spatially limited to the germline stem cell niche in the germarium. We show here that Integrator, a complex known to be involved in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-mediated transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, promotes germline differentiation by restricting niche-derived Dpp/BMP activity in the cytoplasm. Further results show that Integrator works in various developmental contexts to desensitize the cellular response to Dpp/BMP signaling during Drosophila development. Mechanistically, our results show that Integrator forms a multi-subunit complex with the type I receptor Thickveins (Tkv) and other Dpp/BMP signaling components and acts in a negative feedback loop to promote Tkv turnover independent of its transcriptional activity. Similarly, human Integrator subunits bind transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/BMP signaling components and antagonize their activity, suggesting a conserved role of Integrator across metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID-19, but breakthrough infections, emerging variants, and waning immunity warrant the use of boosters. Although mRNA boosters are being implemented, the extent to which pre-existing immunity influences the efficacy of boosters remains unclear. In a cohort of individuals primed with the mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines, we report that lower antibody levels before boost are associated with higher fold-increase in antibody levels after boost, suggesting that pre-existing antibody modulates the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Our studies in mice show that pre-existing antibodies accelerate the clearance of vaccine antigen via Fc-dependent mechanisms, limiting the amount of antigen available to prime B cell responses after mRNA boosters. These data demonstrate a “tug of war” between pre-existing antibody responses and de novo B cell responses following mRNA vaccination, and they suggest that transient downmodulation of antibody effector function may improve the efficacy of mRNA boosters.

Abstract: Summary
Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise a heterogeneous family of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells and ILC1s. We identify a population of “liver-type” ILC1s with transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional features distinct from those of conventional and liver-resident NK cells as well as from other previously described human ILC1 subsets. LT-ILC1s are CD49a+CD94+CD200R1+, express the transcription factor T-BET, and do not express the activating receptor NKp80 or the transcription factor EOMES. Similar to NK cells, liver-type ILC1s produce IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GM-CSF; however, liver-type ILC1s also produce IL-2 and lack perforin and granzyme-B. Liver-type ILC1s are expanded in cirrhotic liver tissues, and they can be produced from blood-derived ILC precursors in vitro in the presence of TGF-β1 and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Cells with similar signature and function can also be found in tonsil and intestinal tissues. Collectively, our study identifies and classifies a population of human cross-tissue ILC1s.

Abstract: Summary
The commensal microbiota regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in bone marrow. Whether and how the microbiota influences HSPC development during embryogenesis is unclear. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish, we show that the microbiota is necessary for HSPC development and differentiation. Individual bacterial strains differentially affect HSPC formation, independent of their effects on myeloid cells. Early-life dysbiosis in chd8−/− zebrafish impairs HSPC development. Wild-type microbiota promote HSPC development by controlling basal inflammatory cytokine expression in kidney niche, and chd8−/− commensals elicit elevated inflammatory cytokines that reduce HSPCs and enhance myeloid differentiation. We identify an Aeromonas veronii strain with immuno-modulatory activities that fails to induce HSPC development in wild-type fish but selectively inhibits kidney cytokine expression and rebalances HSPC development in chd8−/− zebrafish. Our studies highlight the important roles of a balanced microbiome during early HSPC development that ensure proper establishment of lineal precursor for adult hematopoietic system.

Abstract: Summary
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are crucial to guarantee the proper biological functions in immune responses. Although protein phosphorylation has been extensively studied, our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, which occurs based on phosphorylation, is very limited. Protein pyrophosphorylation is originally considered to be a non-enzymatic process, and its function in immune signaling is unknown. Here, we identify a metabolic enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), as a pyrophosphorylase for protein serine pyrophosphorylation, by catalyzing the pyrophosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) at serine (Ser) 386 to promote robust type I interferon (IFN) responses. Uap1 deficiency significantly impairs the activation of both DNA- and RNA-viruse-induced type I IFN pathways, and the Uap1-deficient mice are highly susceptible to lethal viral infection. Our findings demonstrate the function of protein pyrophosphorylation in the regulation of antiviral responses and provide insights into the crosstalk between metabolism and innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
RNA methylation at adenosine N6 (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications, impacting RNA stability, transport, and translation. Previous studies uncovered RNA destabilization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models in association with accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43. Here, we show that TDP43 recognizes m6A RNA and that RNA methylation is critical for both TDP43 binding and autoregulation. We also observed extensive RNA hypermethylation in ALS spinal cord, corresponding to methylated TDP43 substrates. Emphasizing the importance of m6A for TDP43 binding and function, we identified several m6A factors that enhance or suppress TDP43-mediated toxicity via single-cell CRISPR-Cas9 in primary neurons. The most promising modifier—the canonical m6A reader YTHDF2—accumulated within ALS spinal neurons, and its knockdown prolonged the survival of human neurons carrying ALS-associated mutations. Collectively, these data show that m6A modifications modulate RNA binding by TDP43 and that m6A is pivotal for TDP43-related neurodegeneration in ALS.

Abstract: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a severe condition of the spinal cord caused by chronic compression. However, no studies to date have examined the effects of zonisamide (ZNS) on DCM via the Fas/FasL-mediated pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ZNS on a DCM rat model and to explore the potential mechanisms. First, 40 adult Sprague–Dawley rats were used to establish the DCM rat model and were individually divided into four groups: the Sham group, DCM model group (DCM), ZNS group (DCM model rats treated with ZNS, 30 mg/kg/day), and ZNS + CD95 group (DCM model rats treated with ZNS and CD95). Histopathology injury and cell apoptosis, Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) expression and Fas/FasL relative protein levels were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL assay, and immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively. The results of our study demonstrated that ZNS could promote motor recovery while reversing histopathological injury and cell apoptosis in DCM rats. Moreover, Iba-1, Fas and FasL expression in DCM rats was decreased, accompanied by a decrease in cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8/caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9/caspase-9, cleaved caspase-10/caspase-10 and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) levels. All these results revealed that ZNS attenuates DCM injury in a rat model via the regulation of Fas and FasL signaling. Our study indicated that ZNS had beneficial effects on DCM and thus provided a novel theoretical approach for subsequent academic and clinical research on DCM injury.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) ensures that the genome is duplicated exactly once by inhibiting helicase loading factors before activating origin firing. CDK activates origin firing by phosphorylating two substrates, Sld2 and Sld3, forming a transient and limiting intermediate—the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC). Here, we show in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the CDK phosphorylations of Sld3 and Sld2 are rapidly turned over during S phase by the PP2A and PP4 phosphatases. PP2ARts1 targets Sld3 specifically through an Rts1-interaction motif, and this targeted dephosphorylation is important for origin firing genome-wide, for formation of the pre-IC at origins and for ensuring that Sld3 is dephosphorylated in G1 phase. PP2ARts1 promotes replication in vitro, and we show that targeted Sld3 dephosphorylation is critical for viability. Together, these studies demonstrate that phosphatases enforce the correct ordering of replication factor phosphorylation and in addition to kinases are also key drivers of replication initiation.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a widespread destabilizing mark on mRNA, is non-uniformly distributed across the transcriptome, yet the basis for its selective deposition is unknown. Here, we propose that m6A deposition is not selective. Instead, it is exclusion based: m6A consensus motifs are methylated by default, unless they are within a window of ∼100 nt from a splice junction. A simple model which we extensively validate, relying exclusively on presence of m6A motifs and exon-intron architecture, allows in silico recapitulation of experimentally measured m6A profiles. We provide evidence that exclusion from splice junctions is mediated by the exon junction complex (EJC), potentially via physical occlusion, and that previously observed associations between exon-intron architecture and mRNA decay are mechanistically mediated via m6A. Our findings establish a mechanism coupling nuclear mRNA splicing and packaging with the covalent installation of m6A, in turn controlling cytoplasmic decay.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition resulting from damage to the nervous system. Imbalance of spinal excitation and inhibition has been proposed to contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the structural basis of this imbalance remains unknown. Using a preclinical model of neuropathic pain, we show that microglia selectively engulf spinal synapses that are formed by central neurons and spare those of peripheral sensory neurons. Furthermore, we reveal that removal of inhibitory and excitatory synapses exhibits distinct temporal patterns, in which microglia-mediated inhibitory synapse removal precedes excitatory synapse removal. We also find selective and gradual increase in complement depositions on dorsal horn synapses that corresponds to the temporal pattern of microglial synapse pruning activity and type-specific synapse loss. Together, these results define a specific role for microglia in the progression of neuropathic pain pathogenesis and implicate these immune cells in structural remodeling of dorsal horn circuitry.

Abstract: Summary
Our genomes harbor conserved DNA sequences, known as common fragile sites (CFSs), that are difficult to replicate and correspond to regions of genome instability. Following replication stress, CFS loci give rise to breaks or gaps (termed CFS expression) where under-replicated DNA subsequently undergoes mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). We show that loss of the structure-selective endonuclease GEN1 reduces CFS expression, leading to defects in MiDAS, ultrafine anaphase bridge formation, and DNA damage in the ensuing cell cycle due to aberrant chromosome segregation. GEN1 knockout cells also exhibit an elevated frequency of bichromatid constrictions consistent with the presence of unresolved regions of under-replicated DNA. Previously, the role of GEN1 was thought to be restricted to the nucleolytic resolution of recombination intermediates. However, its ability to cleave under-replicated DNA at CFS loci indicates that GEN1 plays a dual role resolving both DNA replication and recombination intermediates before chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
The blood barriers of the nervous system protect neural environments but can hinder therapeutic accessibility. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is well characterized, consisting of endothelial cells with specialized tight junctions and low levels of transcytosis, properties conferred by contacting pericytes and astrocytes. In contrast, the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) of the peripheral nervous system is poorly defined. Here, we characterize the structure of the mammalian BNB, identify the processes that confer barrier function, and demonstrate how the barrier can be opened in response to injury. The homeostatic BNB is leakier than the BBB, which we show is due to higher levels of transcytosis. However, the barrier is reinforced by macrophages that specifically engulf leaked materials, identifying a role for resident macrophages as an important component of the BNB. Finally, we demonstrate the exploitation of these processes to effectively deliver RNA-targeting therapeutics to peripheral nerves, indicating new treatment approaches for nervous system pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Hypertranscription supports biosynthetically demanding cellular states through global transcriptome upregulation. Despite its potential widespread relevance, documented examples of hypertranscription remain few and limited to early development. Here, we demonstrate that absolute scaling of single-cell RNA-sequencing data enables the estimation of total transcript abundances per cell. We validate absolute scaling in known cases of developmental hypertranscription and apply it to adult cell types, revealing a remarkable dynamic range in transcriptional output. In adult organs, hypertranscription marks activated stem/progenitor cells with multilineage potential and is redeployed in conditions of tissue injury, where it precedes bursts of proliferation during regeneration. Our analyses identify a common set of molecular pathways associated with both adult and embryonic hypertranscription, including chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, and translation. These shared features across diverse cell contexts support hypertranscription as a general and dynamic cellular program that is pervasively employed during development, organ maintenance, and regeneration.
