Abstract: Summary
The panoply of microorganisms and other species present in our environment influence human health and disease, especially in cities, but have not been profiled with metagenomics at a city-wide scale. We sequenced DNA from surfaces across the entire New York City (NYC) subway system, the Gowanus Canal, and public parks. Nearly half of the DNA (48%) does not match any known organism; identified organisms spanned 1,688 bacterial, viral, archaeal, and eukaryotic taxa, which were enriched for genera associated with skin (e.g., Acinetobacter). Predicted ancestry of human DNA left on subway surfaces can recapitulate U.S. Census demographic data, and bacterial signatures can match a station’s history, such as marine-associated bacteria in a hurricane-flooded station. This baseline metagenomic map of NYC could help long-term disease surveillance, bioterrorism threat mitigation, and health management in the built environment of cities.

Abstract: Summary
CTCF is a master regulator that plays important roles in genome architecture and gene expression. How CTCF is recruited in a locus-specific manner is not fully understood. Evidence from epigenetic processes, such as X chromosome inactivation (XCI), indicates that CTCF associates functionally with RNA. Using genome-wide approaches to investigate the relationship between its RNA interactome and epigenomic landscape, here we report that CTCF binds thousands of transcripts in mouse embryonic stem cells, many in close proximity to CTCF’s genomic binding sites. CTCF is a specific and high-affinity RNA-binding protein (Kd < 1 nM). During XCI, CTCF differentially binds the active and inactive X chromosomes and interacts directly with Tsix, Xite, and Xist RNAs. Tsix and Xite RNAs target CTCF to the X inactivation center, thereby inducing homologous X chromosome pairing. Our work elucidates one mechanism by which CTCF is recruited in a locus-specific manner and implicates CTCF-RNA interactions in long-range chromosomal interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein that, beyond its apoptotic function, is required for the normal expression of major respiratory chain complexes. Here we identified an AIF-interacting protein, CHCHD4, which is the central component of a redox-sensitive mitochondrial intermembrane space import machinery. Depletion or hypomorphic mutation of AIF caused a downregulation of CHCHD4 protein by diminishing its mitochondrial import. CHCHD4 depletion sufficed to induce a respiratory defect that mimicked that observed in AIF-deficient cells. CHCHD4 levels could be restored in AIF-deficient cells by enforcing its AIF-independent mitochondrial localization. This modified CHCHD4 protein reestablished respiratory function in AIF-deficient cells and enabled AIF-deficient embryoid bodies to undergo cavitation, a process of programmed cell death required for embryonic morphogenesis. These findings explain how AIF contributes to the biogenesis of respiratory chain complexes, and they establish an unexpected link between the vital function of AIF and the propensity of cells to undergo apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
In recent years, tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, have become broadly used to control gene expression by virtue of the Tet-on/Tet-off systems. However, the wide range of direct effects of tetracycline use has not been fully appreciated. We show here that these antibiotics induce a mitonuclear protein imbalance through their effects on mitochondrial translation, an effect that likely reflects the evolutionary relationship between mitochondria and proteobacteria. Even at low concentrations, tetracyclines induce mitochondrial proteotoxic stress, leading to changes in nuclear gene expression and altered mitochondrial dynamics and function in commonly used cell types, as well as worms, flies, mice, and plants. Given that tetracyclines are so widely applied in research, scientists should be aware of their potentially confounding effects on experimental results. Furthermore, these results caution against extensive use of tetracyclines in livestock due to potential downstream impacts on the environment and human health.

Abstract: Summary
Fundamental to cellular processes are directional movements driven by molecular motors. A common theme for these and other molecular machines driven by ATP is that controlled release of hydrolysis products is essential for using the chemical energy efficiently. Mechanochemical transduction by myosin motors on actin is coupled to unknown structural changes that result in the sequential release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and MgADP. We present here a myosin structure possessing an actin-binding interface and a tunnel (back door) that creates an escape route for Pi with a minimal rotation of the myosin lever arm that drives movements. We propose that this state represents the beginning of the powerstroke on actin and that Pi translocation from the nucleotide pocket triggered by actin binding initiates myosin force generation. This elucidates how actin initiates force generation and movement and may represent a strategy common to many molecular machines.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence has been implicated in tumor suppression, development, and aging and is accompanied by large-scale chromatin rearrangements, forming senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). However, how the chromatin is reorganized during SAHF formation is poorly understood. Furthermore, heterochromatin formation in senescence appears to contrast with loss of heterochromatin in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. We mapped architectural changes in genome organization in cellular senescence using Hi-C. Unexpectedly, we find a dramatic sequence- and lamin-dependent loss of local interactions in heterochromatin. This change in local connectivity resolves the paradox of opposing chromatin changes in senescence and progeria. In addition, we observe a senescence-specific spatial clustering of heterochromatic regions, suggesting a unique second step required for SAHF formation. Comparison of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), somatic cells, and senescent cells shows a unidirectional loss in local chromatin connectivity, suggesting that senescence is an endpoint of the continuous nuclear remodelling process during differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells are able to undergo clonal expansion and contraction and to generate self-renewing memory cells after infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). It is unclear whether all or only certain subsets preferentially contribute to the generation of memory NK cells. Here, we show that memory NK cells predominantly arise from killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1)-negative NK cell progenitors, whereas KLRG1-positive NK cells have limited capacity for expansion during infection with MCMV. Unexpectedly, the frequency of KLRG1-positive NK cells is significantly affected by the presence of T cells in the host and potentially by the host microbiota. Our findings demonstrate that excessive availability of interleukin (IL)-15 may erode the pool of memory progenitors, resulting in the decreased efficiency of memory generation in the NK cell lineage.

Abstract: Summary
The coordination of complex tumor processes requires cells to rapidly modify their phenotype and is achieved by direct cell-cell communication through gap junction channels composed of connexins. Previous reports have suggested that gap junctions are tumor suppressive based on connexin 43 (Cx43), but this does not take into account differences in connexin-mediated ion selectivity and intercellular communication rate that drive gap junction diversity. We find that glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess functional gap junctions that can be targeted using clinically relevant compounds to reduce self-renewal and tumor growth. Our analysis reveals that CSCs express Cx46, while Cx43 is predominantly expressed in non-CSCs. During differentiation, Cx46 is reduced, while Cx43 is increased, and targeting Cx46 compromises CSC maintenance. The difference between Cx46 and Cx43 is reflected in elevated cell-cell communication and reduced resting membrane potential in CSCs. Our data demonstrate a pro-tumorigenic role for gap junctions that is dependent on connexin expression.

Abstract: Background
Although the human placenta is considered medical wastes, it has become a main source of stem cells. Due to their easy isolation, ability to resist immune rejection and ability to differentiate into different types of adult cells, placental stem cells are considered superior to other stem cells.
Objectives
This study aimed to assess the impact of the maternal age on the expression of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers CD105 and CD29 in different areas of a term human placenta and to identify the differential expression of these markers in different placental areas.
Subjects and methods
In this comparative cross sectional study, one hundred term placentas were collected after delivery from healthy mothers divided into five groups according to their age. Placentas were processed to assess both immune- and gene-expression of CD105 and CD29 surface antigen markers. Data of the different studied age groups was compared using the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) software.
Results
CD105 and CD29 immunoexpression in decidua basalis, fetal membrane and placental villi showed significant negative correlations with the maternal age. CD105- and CD29-positive MSCs were significantly abundant in the decidua basalis and placental villi. Real-time polymerase chain reaction results were consistent with those of the immunohistochemical study.
Conclusion
Labeling the placenta-driven MSCs with the specific area from which the cells were taken as well as the mother's age is advised and could be helpful in controlling the quality of the cell banks as well as the favorable outcome of the therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Methods for single-cell genome and transcriptome sequencing have contributed to our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, whereas methods for single-cell epigenomics are much less established. Here, we describe a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) assay that enables DNA methylation mapping in very small cell populations (μWGBS) and single cells (scWGBS). Our assay is optimized for profiling many samples at low coverage, and we describe a bioinformatic method that analyzes collections of single-cell methylomes to infer cell-state dynamics. Using these technological advances, we studied epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, where we observed characteristic patterns of epigenome remodeling and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The described method enables single-cell analysis of DNA methylation in a broad range of biological systems, including embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer. It can also be used to establish composite methylomes that account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex tissue samples.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal accumulation of UBB+1, a frameshift variant of ubiquitin B, is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). How UBB+1 contributes to neuronal dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we show that in brain regions of AD patients with neurofibrillary tangles UBB+1 co-exists with VMS1, the mitochondrion-specific component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Expression of UBB+1 in yeast disturbs the UPS, leading to mitochondrial stress and apoptosis. Inhibiting UPS activity exacerbates while stimulating UPS by the transcription activator Rpn4 reduces UBB+1-triggered cytotoxicity. High levels of the Rpn4 target protein Cdc48 and its cofactor Vms1 are sufficient to relieve programmed cell death. We identified the UBB+1-induced enhancement of the basic amino acids arginine, ornithine, and lysine at mitochondria as a decisive toxic event, which can be reversed by Cdc48/Vms1-mediated proteolysis. The fact that AD-induced cellular dysfunctions can be avoided by UPS activity at mitochondria has potentially far-reaching pathophysiological implications.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic inhibition of PI3K signaling increases energy expenditure, protects from obesity and metabolic syndrome, and extends longevity. Here, we show that two pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, CNIO-PI3Ki and GDC-0941, decrease the adiposity of obese mice without affecting their lean mass. Long-term treatment of obese mice with low doses of CNIO-PI3Ki reduces body weight until reaching a balance that is stable for months as long as the treatment continues. CNIO-PI3Ki treatment also ameliorates liver steatosis and decreases glucose serum levels. The above observations have been recapitulated in independent laboratories and using different oral formulations of CNIO-PI3Ki. Finally, daily oral treatment of obese rhesus monkeys for 3 months with low doses of CNIO-PI3Ki decreased their adiposity and lowered their serum glucose levels, in the absence of detectable toxicities. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K is an effective and safe anti-obesity intervention that could reverse the negative effects of metabolic syndrome in humans.

Abstract: The most frequent form of hereditary blindness, autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), is caused by the mutation of the mitochondrial protein Opa1 and the ensuing degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Previously we found that knockdown of OPA1 enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (Fülöp et al., 2011). Therefore we studied mitochondrial Ca2+ metabolism in fibroblasts obtained from members of an ADOA family. Gene sequencing revealed heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (c. 984+1G>A) in intron 9 of the OPA1 gene. ADOA cells showed a higher rate of apoptosis than control cells and their mitochondria displayed increased fragmentation when forced to oxidative metabolism. The ophthalmological parameters critical fusion frequency and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer thickness were inversely correlated to the evoked mitochondrial Ca2+ signals. The present data indicate that enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is a pathogenetic factor in the progress of ADOA.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreted from enteroendocrine L cells promotes nutrient disposal via the incretin effect. However, the majority of L cells are localized to the distal gut, suggesting additional biological roles for GLP-1. Here, we demonstrate that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling controls mucosal expansion of the small bowel (SB) and colon. These actions did not require the epidermal growth factor (EGF) or intestinal epithelial insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) receptors but were absent in Glp1r−/− mice. Polyp number and size were increased in SB of exendin-4-treated ApcMin/+ mice, whereas polyp number was reduced in SB and colon of Glp1r−/−:ApcMin/+ mice. Exendin-4 increased fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) expression in colonic polyps of ApcMin/+ mice and failed to increase intestinal growth in mice lacking Fgf7. Exogenous exendin-4 and Fgf7 regulated an overlapping set of genes important for intestinal growth. Thus, gain and loss of GLP-1R signaling regulates gut growth and intestinal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: This study investigated how liquid diet feeding affects the growth of parotid glands. We weaned 21-day-old rats and thereafter fed them a pellet diet (control group) or a liquid diet (experimental group) for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Their parotid glands were excised, weighed, examined, and tested for 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and cleaved caspase-3 (Casp-3) as markers of proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Parotid gland weights were consistently smaller in experimental animals than in controls. Morphometrical analysis showed that control group acinar cells increased in area during the experiment, but experimental group acinar cells were almost unchanged. Labeling indices of BrdU in acinar cells in both groups declined during the experiment, but were consistently lower in the experimental group than in controls. Casp-3-positive acinar cells were rare in both groups, which consistently express significantly similar Casp-3 levels. Ultrastructurally, terminal portions of the experimental parotid glands consisted of a few acinar cells that were smaller than those in controls. Control acinar cells showed mitotic figures within short experimental periods, but not in experimental glands. These observations indicate that liquid diet feeding inhibits growth of parotid glands in growing rats through suppression of growth and proliferation of individual acinar cells, but not through apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acids (FAs) provide cellular energy under starvation, yet how they mobilize and move into mitochondria in starved cells, driving oxidative respiration, is unclear. Here, we clarify this process by visualizing FA trafficking with a fluorescent FA probe. The labeled FA accumulated in lipid droplets (LDs) in well-fed cells but moved from LDs into mitochondria when cells were starved. Autophagy in starved cells replenished LDs with FAs, increasing LD number over time. Cytoplasmic lipases removed FAs from LDs, enabling their transfer into mitochondria. This required mitochondria to be highly fused and localized near LDs. When mitochondrial fusion was prevented in starved cells, FAs neither homogeneously distributed within mitochondria nor became efficiently metabolized. Instead, FAs reassociated with LDs and fluxed into neighboring cells. Thus, FAs engage in complex trafficking itineraries regulated by cytoplasmic lipases, autophagy, and mitochondrial fusion dynamics, ensuring maximum oxidative metabolism and avoidance of FA toxicity in starved cells.

Abstract: Summary
Advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) frequently acquire resistance to Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors through unknown mechanisms. Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists.

A Role for the Ancient SNARE Syntaxin 17 in Regulating Mitochondrial Division,

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules mark the sites where the GTPase Drp1 promotes mitochondrial fission via a largely unknown mechanism. Here, we show that the SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (Syn17) is present on raft-like structures of ER-mitochondria contact sites and promotes mitochondrial fission by determining Drp1 localization and activity. The hairpin-like C-terminal hydrophobic domain, including Lys-254, but not the SNARE domain, is important for this regulation. Syn17 also regulates ER Ca2+ homeostasis and interferes with Rab32-mediated regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Starvation disrupts the Syn17-Drp1 interaction, thus favoring mitochondrial elongation during autophagy. Because we also demonstrate that Syn17 is an ancient SNARE, our findings suggest that Syn17 is one of the original key regulators for ER-mitochondria contact sites present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. As such, Syn17 acts as a switch that responds to nutrient conditions and integrates functions for the ER and autophagosomes with mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
mtDNA mutagenesis in somatic stem cells leads to their dysfunction and to progeria in mouse. The mechanism was proposed to involve modification of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/redox signaling. We studied the effect of mtDNA mutagenesis on reprogramming and stemness of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and show that PSCs select against specific mtDNA mutations, mimicking germline and promoting mtDNA integrity despite their glycolytic metabolism. Furthermore, mtDNA mutagenesis is associated with an increase in mitochondrial H2O2, reduced PSC reprogramming efficiency, and self-renewal. Mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone, MitoQ, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine efficiently rescued these defects, indicating that both reprogramming efficiency and stemness are modified by mitochondrial ROS. The redox sensitivity, however, rendered PSCs and especially neural stem cells sensitive to MitoQ toxicity. Our results imply that stem cell compartment warrants special attention when the safety of new antioxidants is assessed and point to an essential role for mitochondrial redox signaling in maintaining normal stem cell function.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the main Ca2+ entry pathway of non-excitable cells. In the past decade, the activation of this entry has been unveiled, with STIM1, a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum able to sense the intraluminal Ca2+ content, and Orai1, the pore-forming unit of the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. When Ca2+ ions are released from the endoplasmic reticulum, STIM1 proteins oligomerize and directly interact with Orai1 proteins, allowing the opening of the CRAC channels and a massive Ca2+ ion influx known as SOCE. As Ca2+ is involved in various cellular processes, the discovery of new drugs acting on the SOCE should be of interest to control the cell activity. By testing analogs of 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), a well known, though not so selective effector of the SOCE, we identified methoxy diethylborinate (MDEB), a molecule able to potentiate the SOCE in three leukocyte and two breast cancer cell lines by increasing the Ca2+ influx amplitude. Unlike 2-APB, MDEB does not affect the Ca2+ pumps or the Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. MDEB could therefore represent the first member of a new group of molecules, specifically able to potentiate SOCE. Although not toxic for non-activated Jurkat T cells, it could induce the apoptosis of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cells.

Abstract: Summary
Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) is a potent inhibitor of neuronal regeneration and a regulator of cell death, and it plays a role in multiple sclerosis (MS). In autopsy material from progressive MS patients, RGMa was found in active and chronic lesions, as well as in normal-appearing gray and white matter, and was expressed by cellular meningeal infiltrates. Levels of soluble RGMa in the cerebrospinal fluid were decreased in progressive MS patients successfully treated with intrathecal corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), showing functional improvements. In vitro, RGMa monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reversed RGMa-mediated neurite outgrowth inhibition and chemorepulsion. In animal models of CNS damage and MS, RGMa antibody stimulated regeneration and remyelination of damaged nerve fibers, accelerated functional recovery, and protected the retinal nerve fiber layer as measured by clinically relevant optic coherence tomography. These data suggest that targeting RGMa is a promising strategy to improve functional recovery in MS patients.

Abstract: Summary
During viral RNA synthesis, Ebola virus (EBOV) nucleoprotein (NP) alternates between an RNA-template-bound form and a template-free form to provide the viral polymerase access to the RNA template. In addition, newly synthesized NP must be prevented from indiscriminately binding to noncognate RNAs. Here, we investigate the molecular bases for these critical processes. We identify an intrinsically disordered peptide derived from EBOV VP35 (NPBP, residues 20–48) that binds NP with high affinity and specificity, inhibits NP oligomerization, and releases RNA from NP-RNA complexes in vitro. The structure of the NPBP/ΔNPNTD complex, solved to 3.7 Å resolution, reveals how NPBP peptide occludes a large surface area that is important for NP-NP and NP-RNA interactions and for viral RNA synthesis. Together, our results identify a highly conserved viral interface that is important for EBOV replication and can be targeted for therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
The scaffold protein p62/SQSTM1 is involved in protein turnover and signaling and is commonly found in dense protein bodies in eukaryotic cells. In autophagy, p62 acts as a selective autophagy receptor that recognizes and shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosome for degradation. The structural organization of p62 in cellular bodies and the interplay of these assemblies with ubiquitin and the autophagic marker LC3 remain to be elucidated. Here, we present a cryo-EM structural analysis of p62. Together with structures of assemblies from the PB1 domain, we show that p62 is organized in flexible polymers with the PB1 domain constituting a helical scaffold. Filamentous p62 is capable of binding LC3 and addition of long ubiquitin chains induces disassembly and shortening of filaments. These studies explain how p62 assemblies provide a large molecular scaffold for the nascent autophagosome and reveal how they can bind ubiquitinated cargo.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory gene response requires activation of the protein kinase TAK1, but it is currently unknown how TAK1-derived signals coordinate transcriptional programs in the genome. We determined the genome-wide binding of the TAK1-controlled NF-κB subunit p65 in relation to active enhancers and promoters of transcribed genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments. Out of 35,000 active enhancer regions, 410 H3K4me1-positive enhancers show interleukin 1 (IL-1)-induced H3K27ac and p65 binding. Inhibition of TAK1 or IKK2 or depletion of p65 blocked inducible enhancer activation and gene expression. As exemplified by the CXC chemokine cluster located on chromosome 4, the TAK1-p65 pathway also regulates the recruitment kinetics of the histone acetyltransferase CBP, of NF-κB p50, and of AP-1 transcription factors to both promoters and enhancers. This study provides a high-resolution view of epigenetic changes occurring during the IL-1 response and allows the genome-wide identification of a distinct class of inducible p65 NF-κB-dependent enhancers in epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences are highly structured elements found downstream of ∼500 genes in Escherichia coli that result in extensive stem-loop structures in their mRNAs. However, their physiological role has remained elusive. Here, we show that REP sequences can downregulate translation, but only if they are within 15 nt of a termination codon; a spacing of 16 nt has no effect, suggesting that the REP element acts to stall ribosome movement. Ribosome stalling leads to cleavage of the mRNA and induction of the trans-translation process. Using nrdAB as a model, we find that its regulation can be partially reversed by overexpression of RNA helicases and can be fully overcome upon UV stress, emphasizing the importance of this regulatory process. Since 50% of REP-associated genes have these elements within the critical 15 nt, these findings identify a regulatory mechanism with the potential to affect translation from a large number of genes.

Abstract: Summary
The remarkable capacity for pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) requires a finely tuned transcriptional circuitry wherein the pathways and genes that initiate differentiation are suppressed, but poised to respond rapidly to developmental signals. To elucidate transcriptional control in mouse ESCs in the naive, ground state, we defined the distribution of engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at high resolution. We find that promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II is most enriched at genes regulating cell cycle and signal transduction and not, as expected, at developmental or bivalent genes. Accordingly, ablation of the primary pause-inducing factor NELF does not increase expression of lineage markers, but instead causes proliferation defects, embryonic lethality, and dysregulation of ESC signaling pathways. Indeed, ESCs lacking NELF have dramatically attenuated FGF/ERK activity, rendering them resistant to differentiation. This work thus uncovers a key role for NELF-mediated pausing in establishing the responsiveness of stem cells to developmental cues.

Abstract: Summary
In PTEN-mutated tumors, we show that PI3Kα activity is suppressed and PI3K signaling is driven by PI3Kβ. A selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ inhibits the Akt/mTOR pathway in these tumors but not in those driven by receptor tyrosine kinases. However, inhibition of PI3Kβ only transiently inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling because it relieves feedback inhibition of IGF1R and other receptors and thus causes activation of PI3Kα and a rebound in downstream signaling. This rebound is suppressed and tumor growth inhibition enhanced with combined inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kβ. In PTEN-deficient models of prostate cancer, this effective inhibition of PI3K causes marked activation of androgen receptor activity. Combined inhibition of both PI3K isoforms and androgen receptor results in major tumor regressions.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that regulate alternative precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing are largely unknown. Here, we perform an RNAi screen to identify factors required for alternative splicing regulation by RBFOX2, an RNA-binding protein that promotes either exon inclusion or exclusion. Unexpectedly, we find that two mRNA 3′ end formation factors, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and SYMPK, are RBFOX2 cofactors for both inclusion and exclusion of internal exons. RBFOX2 interacts with CPSF/SYMPK and recruits it to the pre-mRNA. RBFOX2 and CPSF/SYMPK then function together to regulate binding of the early intron recognition factors U2AF and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP). Genome-wide analysis reveals that CPSF also mediates alternative splicing of many internal exons in the absence of RBFOX2. Accordingly, we show that CPSF/SYMPK is also a cofactor of NOVA2 and heterologous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), RNA-binding proteins that also regulate alternative splicing. Collectively, our results reveal an unanticipated role for mRNA 3′ end formation factors in global promotion of alternative splicing.

Abstract: Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent with side effects especially on skin. Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ antidiabetic agent with antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic efficiencies of simvastatin and pioglitazone separately and in combination against bleomycin-induced changes in mice thin skin using histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical techniques. In this study, the mice were divided into seven groups, with each group undergoing treatment for 3 weeks: the control group, group 1 was administered 100μl of bleomycin, group 2 was administered simvastatin (5mg/kg/day), group 3 received pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day), group 4 received simvastatin (5mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin, group 5 received pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin, and group 6 was administered simvastatin (5mg/kg/day) and pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin. In group 2, dermal thickening, subcutaneous fat atrophy, degeneration of hair follicles, and thickening of cutaneous vessel walls were observed in addition to a significant increase in caspase-3 reaction, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) expression, and hydroxyproline content. A reversal of the previous findings was markedly observed in group 6 compared with groups 4 and 5. We conclude that the concurrent administration of pioglitazone and simvastatin enhanced their beneficial effects in the reversal of bleomycin-induced changes in mice thin skin.

Abstract: Summary
LKB1 regulates both cell growth and energy metabolism. It remains unclear how LKB1 inactivation coordinates tumor progression with metabolic adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here in KrasG12D;Lkb1lox/lox (KL) mouse model, we reveal differential reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ROS can modulate ADC-to-SCC transdifferentiation (AST). Further, pentose phosphate pathway deregulation and impaired fatty acid oxidation collectively contribute to the redox imbalance and functionally affect AST. Similar tumor and redox heterogeneity also exist in human NSCLC with LKB1 inactivation. In preclinical trials toward metabolic stress, certain KL ADC can develop drug resistance through squamous transdifferentiation. This study uncovers critical redox control of tumor plasticity that may affect therapeutic response in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Viral glycoproteins mediate entry by pH-activated or receptor-engaged activation and exist in metastable pre-fusogenic states that may be stabilized by directed rational design. As recently reported, the conformationally fixed HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers in the pre-fusion state (SOSIP) display molecular homogeneity and structural integrity at relatively high levels of resolution. However, the SOSIPs necessitate full Env precursor cleavage, which requires endogenous furin overexpression. Here, we developed an alternative strategy using flexible peptide covalent linkage of Env subdomains to produce soluble, homogeneous, and cleavage-independent Env mimics, called native flexibly linked (NFL) trimers, as vaccine candidates. This simplified design avoids the need for furin co-expression and, in one case, antibody affinity purification to accelerate trimer scale-up for preclinical and clinical applications. We have successfully translated the NFL design to multiple HIV-1 subtypes, establishing the potential to become a general method of producing native-like, well-ordered Env trimers for HIV-1 or other viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Micro- and nanometer-size particles have become popular candidates for cancer vaccine adjuvants. However, the mechanism by which such particles enhance immune responses remains unclear. Here, we report a porous silicon microparticle (PSM)-based cancer vaccine that greatly enhances cross-presentation and activates type I interferon (IFN-I) response in dendritic cells (DCs). PSM-loaded antigen exhibited prolonged early endosome localization and enhanced cross-presentation through both proteasome- and lysosome-dependent pathways. Phagocytosis of PSM by DCs induced IFN-I responses through a TRIF- and MAVS-dependent pathway. DCs primed with PSM-loaded HER2 antigen produced robust CD8 T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in mice bearing HER2+ mammary gland tumors. Importantly, this vaccination activated the tumor immune microenvironment with elevated levels of intra-tumor IFN-I and MHCII expression, abundant CD11c+ DC infiltration, and tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell responses. These findings highlight the potential of PSM as an immune adjuvant to potentiate DC-based cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
During ribosomal and transfer RNA maturation, external transcribed spacer (ETS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are excised and, as non-functional by-products, are rapidly degraded. However, we report that the 3′ETS of the glyW-cysT-leuZ polycistronic tRNA precursor is highly and specifically enriched by co-purification with at least two different small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), RyhB and RybB. Both sRNAs are shown to base pair with the same region in the 3′ETS of leuZ (3′ETSleuZ). Disrupting the pairing by mutating 3′ETSleuZ strongly increased the activity of sRNAs, even under non-inducing conditions. Our results indicate that 3′ETSleuZ prevents sRNA-dependent remodeling of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle fluxes and decreases antibiotic sensitivity when sRNAs are transcriptionally repressed. This suggests that 3′ETSleuZ functions as a sponge to absorb transcriptional noise from repressed sRNAs. Additional data showing RybB and MicF sRNAs are co-purified with ITSmetZ-metW and ITSmetW-metV strongly suggest a wide distribution of this phenomenon.

Abstract: Summary
The abundance of cell-surface membrane proteins is regulated by internalization and delivery into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Many cargoes are ubiquitinated, allowing access to an ESCRT-dependent pathway into MVBs. Yet how nonubiquitinated proteins, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, enter MVBs is unclear, supporting the possibility of mechanistically distinct ILV biogenesis pathways. Here we show that a family of highly ubiquitinated tetraspan Cos proteins provides a Ub signal in trans, allowing sorting of nonubiquitinated MVB cargo into the canonical ESCRT- and Ub-dependent pathway. Cos proteins create discrete endosomal subdomains that concentrate Ub cargo prior to their envelopment into ILVs, and the activity of Cos proteins is required not only for efficient sorting of canonical Ub cargo but also for sorting nonubiquitinated cargo into MVBs. Expression of these proteins increases during nutrient stress through an NAD+/Sir2-dependent mechanism that in turn accelerates the downregulation of a broad range of cell-surface proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Controversy surrounds neutrophil function in cancer because neutrophils were shown to provide both pro- and antitumor functions. We identified a heterogeneous subset of low-density neutrophils (LDNs) that appear transiently in self-resolving inflammation but accumulate continuously with cancer progression. LDNs display impaired neutrophil function and immunosuppressive properties, characteristics that are in stark contrast to those of mature, high-density neutrophils (HDNs). LDNs consist of both immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and mature cells that are derived from HDNs in a TGF-β-dependent mechanism. Our findings identify three distinct populations of circulating neutrophils and challenge the concept that mature neutrophils have limited plasticity. Furthermore, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation to mitigate the controversy surrounding neutrophil function in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mind bomb (Mib) proteins are large, multi-domain E3 ligases that promote ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails of Notch ligands. This ubiquitination step marks the ligand proteins for epsin-dependent endocytosis, which is critical for in vivo Notch receptor activation. We present here crystal structures of the substrate recognition domains of Mib1, both in isolation and in complex with peptides derived from Notch ligands. The structures, in combination with biochemical, cellular, and in vivo assays, show that Mib1 contains two independent substrate recognition domains that engage two distinct epitopes from the cytoplasmic tail of the ligand Jagged1, one in the intracellular membrane proximal region and the other near the C terminus. Together, these studies provide insights into the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by Mind bomb E3 ligases, illuminate a key event in ligand-induced activation of Notch receptors, and identify a potential target for therapeutic modulation of Notch signal transduction in disease.

Abstract: The correction of disease-causing mutations by single-strand oligonucleotide-templated DNA repair (ssOR) is an attractive approach to gene therapy, but major improvements in ssOR efficiency and consistency are needed. The mechanism of ssOR is poorly understood but may involve annealing of oligonucleotides to transiently exposed single-stranded regions in the target duplex. In bacteria and yeast it has been shown that ssOR is promoted by expression of Redβ, a single-strand DNA annealing protein from bacteriophage lambda. Here we show that Redβ expression is well tolerated in a human cell line where it consistently promotes ssOR. By use of short interfering RNA, we also show that ssOR is stimulated by the transient depletion of the endogenous DNA mismatch repair protein MSH2. Furthermore, we find that the effects of Redβ expression and MSH2 depletion on ssOR can be combined with a degree of cooperativity. These results suggest that oligonucleotide annealing and mismatch recognition are distinct but interdependent events in ssOR that can be usefully modulated in gene correction strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Itraconazole (ITZ) is a well-known antifungal agent that also has anticancer activity. In this study, we identify ITZ as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-71, rhinovirus). We demonstrate that ITZ inhibits viral RNA replication by targeting oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related protein 4 (ORP4). Consistently, OSW-1, a specific OSBP/ORP4 antagonist, also inhibits enterovirus replication. Knockdown of OSBP inhibits virus replication, whereas overexpression of OSBP or ORP4 counteracts the antiviral effects of ITZ and OSW-1. ITZ binds OSBP and inhibits its function, i.e., shuttling of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate between membranes, thereby likely perturbing the virus-induced membrane alterations essential for viral replication organelle formation. ITZ also inhibits hepatitis C virus replication, which also relies on OSBP. Together, these data implicate OSBP/ORP4 as molecular targets of ITZ and point to an essential role of OSBP/ORP4-mediated lipid exchange in virus replication that can be targeted by antiviral drugs.

Abstract: Summary
We investigate crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal myeloid cells. We find that Lewis lung carcinoma cells significantly induce PPARβ/δ activity in myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo. Myeloid cell-specific knockout of PPARβ/δ results in impaired growth of implanted tumors, and this is restored by adoptive transfer of wild-type myeloid cells. We find that IL-10 is a downstream effector of PPARβ/δ and facilitates tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis. This observation is supported by the finding that the CD11blowIL-10+ pro-tumoral myeloid cell is scarcely detected in tumors from myeloid-cell-specific PPARβ/δ knockout mice, where vessel densities are also decreased. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is shown to be an upstream regulator of PPARβ/δ in myeloid cells and is induced by M-CSF secreted from tumor cells. Our study gives insight into how cancer cells influence myeloid stromal cells to get a pro-tumoral phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
BrafV600E induces benign, growth-arrested melanocytic nevus development, but also drives melanoma formation. Cdkn2a loss in BrafV600E melanocytes in mice results in rare progression to melanoma, but only after stable growth arrest as nevi. Immediate progression to melanoma is prevented by upregulation of miR-99/100, which downregulates mTOR and IGF1R signaling. mTORC1 activation through Stk11 (Lkb1) loss abrogates growth arrest of BrafV600E melanocytic nevi, but is insufficient for complete progression to melanoma. Cdkn2a loss is associated with mTORC2 and Akt activation in human and murine melanocytic neoplasms. Simultaneous Cdkn2a and Lkb1 inactivation in BrafV600E melanocytes results in activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2/Akt, inducing rapid melanoma formation in mice. In this model, activation of both mTORC1/2 is required for Braf-induced melanomagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mapping host-pathogen interactions has proven instrumental for understanding how viruses manipulate host machinery and how numerous cellular processes are regulated. DNA viruses such as herpesviruses have relatively large coding capacity and thus can target an extensive network of cellular proteins. To identify the host proteins hijacked by this pathogen, we systematically affinity tagged and purified all 89 proteins of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from human cells. Mass spectrometry of this material identified over 500 virus-host interactions. KSHV causes AIDS-associated cancers, and its interaction network is enriched for proteins linked to cancer and overlaps with proteins that are also targeted by HIV-1. We found that the conserved KSHV protein ORF24 binds to RNA polymerase II and brings it to viral late promoters by mimicking and replacing cellular TATA-box-binding protein (TBP). This is required for herpesviral late gene expression, a complex and poorly understood phase of the viral lifecycle.

Abstract: Summary
The precise timing of pyramidal cell migration from the ventricular germinal zone to the cortical plate is essential for establishing cortical layers, and migration errors can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders underlying psychiatric and neurological diseases. Here, we report that Wnt canonical as well as non-canonical signaling is active in pyramidal precursors during radial migration. We demonstrate using constitutive and conditional genetic strategies that transient downregulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling during the multipolar stage plays a critical role in polarizing and orienting cells for radial migration. In addition, we show that reduced canonical Wnt signaling is triggered cell autonomously by time-dependent expression of Wnt5A and activation of non-canonical signaling. We identify ephrin-B1 as a canonical Wnt-signaling-regulated target in control of the multipolar-to-bipolar switch. These findings highlight the critical role of Wnt signaling activity in neuronal positioning during cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Gametogenesis is dependent on the expression of germline-specific genes. However, it remains unknown how the germline epigenome is distinctly established from that of somatic lineages. Here we show that genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis-progenitor cells undergo repression in a genome-wide manner in late stages of the male germline and identify underlying mechanisms. SCML2, a germline-specific subunit of a Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), establishes the unique epigenome of the male germline through two distinct antithetical mechanisms. SCML2 works with PRC1 and promotes RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A, thereby marking somatic/progenitor genes on autosomes for repression. Paradoxically, SCML2 also prevents RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A on sex chromosomes during meiosis, thereby enabling unique epigenetic programming of sex chromosomes for male reproduction. Our results reveal divergent mechanisms involving a shared regulator by which the male germline epigenome is distinguished from that of the soma and progenitor cells.

Abstract: The spermatozoa of the longhorn beetles Stictoleptura cordigera were ultrastructurally described in this paper. They have an apical bilayered acrosome, an elongated nucleus, a centriole with star-shape links, two asymmetric mitochondrial derivatives partially crystallized and a 9+9+2 flagellar axoneme with accessory tubules provided with 16 protofilaments in their wall. A centriole adjunct is present and gives rise to two thick laminae as accessory bodies, also asymmetrical, to which two relatively small puff-like structures of different size are connected. These features were previously found in the sperm of the cerambycid Morimus asper. The strict similarity of the cerambycid sperm characters with those of curculionoids indicates a clear phylogenetic relationship between Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea.

Abstract: Summary
The E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, deregulated in carcinoma, has been implicated in tumor formation. Here, we uncover a role for HUWE1 in cell migration and invasion through degrading the RAC activator TIAM1, implying an additional function in malignant progression. In MDCKII cells in response to HGF, HUWE1 catalyzes TIAM1 ubiquitylation and degradation predominantly at cell-cell adhesions, facilitating junction disassembly, migration, and invasion. Depleting HUWE1 or mutating the TIAM1 ubiquitylation site prevents TIAM1 degradation, antagonizing scattering, and invasion. Moreover, simultaneous depletion of TIAM1 restores migration and invasion in HUWE1-depleted cells. Significantly, we show that HUWE1 stimulates human lung cancer cell invasion through regulating TIAM1 stability. Finally, we demonstrate that HUWE1 and TIAM1 protein levels are inversely correlated in human lung carcinomas. Thus, we elucidate a critical role for HUWE1 in regulating epithelial cell-cell adhesion and provide additional evidence that ubiquitylation contributes to spatiotemporal control of RAC.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages activated by the TLR4 agonist LPS undergo dramatic changes in their metabolic activity. We here show that LPS induces expression of the key metabolic regulator Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). Activation of PKM2 using two well-characterized small molecules, DASA-58 and TEPP-46, inhibited LPS-induced Hif-1α and IL-1β, as well as the expression of a range of other Hif-1α-dependent genes. Activation of PKM2 attenuated an LPS-induced proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype while promoting traits typical of an M2 macrophage. We show that LPS-induced PKM2 enters into a complex with Hif-1α, which can directly bind to the IL-1β promoter, an event that is inhibited by activation of PKM2. Both compounds inhibited LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming and succinate production. Finally, activation of PKM2 by TEPP-46 in vivo inhibited LPS and Salmonella typhimurium-induced IL-1β production, while boosting production of IL-10. PKM2 is therefore a critical determinant of macrophage activation by LPS, promoting the inflammatory response.

Abstract: Summary
The pluripotent epiblast (EPI) is the founder tissue of almost all somatic cells. EPI and primitive endoderm (PrE) progenitors arise from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst-stage embryo. The EPI lineage is distinctly identified by its expression of pluripotency-associated factors. Many of these factors have been reported to exhibit dynamic fluctuations of expression in embryonic stem cell cultures. Whether these fluctuations correlating with ICM fate choice occur in vivo remains an open question. Using single-cell resolution quantitative imaging of a Nanog transcriptional reporter, we noted an irreversible commitment to EPI/PrE lineages in vivo. A period of apoptosis occurred concomitantly with ICM cell-fate choice, followed by a burst of EPI-specific cell proliferation. Transitions were occasionally observed from PrE-to-EPI, but not vice versa, suggesting that they might be regulated and not stochastic. We propose that the rapid timescale of early mammalian embryonic development prevents fluctuations in cell fate.

Abstract: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important redox-sensitive transcription factor that regulates the expression of several cytoprotective genes. More recently, genetic analyses of human tumors have indicated that Nrf2 may cause resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we found that the expression levels of Nrf2 and its target genes GCLC, HO-1, NQO1 were significantly higher in cisplatin-resistant A549 (A549/CDDP) cells than those in A549 cells, and this resistance was partially reversed by Nrf2 siRNA. 3′,4′,5′,5,7-Pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), a natural flavonoid extracted from Rutaceae plants, sensitized A549/CDDP to CDDP and substantially induced apoptosis compared with that of CDDP alone treated group, and this reversal effect decreased when Nrf2 was downregulated by siRNA. Mechanistically, PMF reduced Nrf2 expression leading to a reduction of Nrf2 downstream genes, and in contrast, this effect was decreased by blocking Nrf2 with siRNA. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PMF could be used as an effective adjuvant sensitizer to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs by downregulating Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins converge upon the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. Here we investigated the mechanistic relationship between mitochondrial shape and MOMP and provide evidence that BAX requires a distinct mitochondrial size to induce MOMP. We utilized the terminal unfolded protein response pathway to systematically define proapoptotic BCL-2 protein composition after stress and then directly interrogated their requirement for a productive mitochondrial size. Complementary biochemical, cellular, in vivo, and ex vivo studies reveal that Mfn1, a GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, establishes a mitochondrial size that is permissive for proapoptotic BCL-2 family function. Cells with hyperfragmented mitochondria, along with size-restricted OMM model systems, fail to support BAX-dependent membrane association and permeabilization due to an inability to stabilize BAXα9·membrane interactions. This work identifies a mechanistic contribution of mitochondrial size in dictating BAX activation, MOMP, and apoptosis.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is considered as the most severe form of cardiovascular diseases as it alters the structure of the elastin and collagen and, consequently, the mechanical properties of the artery wall. The role of collagen fibers orientations in the mechanical properties of the healthy and atherosclerotic human coronary arteries so far has not been well determined. In this study, a fiber family based constitutive equation was employed to address the mechanical behavior of healthy and atherosclerotic human coronary arteries using the combination of histostructural and uniaxial data. A group of six healthy and atherosclerotic human coronary arteries was excised at autopsy and histological analyses were performed on each artery to determine the mean angle of collagen fibers. The preconditioned arterial tissues were then subjected to a series of quasi-static axial and circumferential loadings. The key role of fiber orientation was explicitly added into a proposed strain energy density function. The constrained nonlinear optimization method was used to determine the material coefficients based on the axial and circumferential extension data of the arteries. The material coefficients of coronary arteries were given with R2≥0.991. The results regardless of loading direction revealed a significant load-bearing capacity and stiffness of atherosclerotic arteries compared to the healthy ones (p<0.005). The optimized fiber angles were in good agreement with the experimental histological data as only 2.52% and 10.10% differences were observed for the healthy and atherosclerotic arteries, respectively. The stored energy function of the healthy arteries was found to be higher than that of atherosclerotic ones. These findings help us to understand the directional mechanical properties of coronary arteries which may have implications for different types of interventions and surgeries, including bypass, stenting, and balloon-angioplasty.

Abstract: Summary
Although endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs) have been described in many species, still little is known about their endogenous utility. Here, we show that Drosophila hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) generate an endo-siRNA class with predominant expression in testes. Although hpRNAs are universally recently evolved, we identify highly complementary protein-coding targets for all hpRNAs. Importantly, we find broad evidence for evolutionary divergences that preferentially maintain compensatory pairing between hpRNAs and targets, serving as first evidence for adaptive selection for siRNA-mediated target regulation in metazoans. We demonstrate organismal impact of hpRNA activity, since knockout of hpRNA1 derepresses its target ATP synthase-β in testes and compromises spermatogenesis and male fertility. Moreover, we reveal surprising male-specific impact of RNAi factors on germ cell development and fertility, consistent with testis-directed function of the hpRNA pathway. Finally, the collected hpRNA loci chronicle an evolutionary timeline that reflects their origins from prospective target genes, mirroring a strategy described for plant miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing energy expenditure through activation of endogenous brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential approach to treat obesity and diabetes. The class of β3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists stimulates rodent BAT, but this activity has never been demonstrated in humans. Here we determined the ability of 200 mg oral mirabegron (Myrbetriq, Astellas Pharma, Inc.), a β3-AR agonist currently approved to treat overactive bladder, to stimulate BAT as compared to placebo. Mirabegron led to higher BAT metabolic activity as measured via 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) using positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) in all twelve healthy male subjects (p = 0.001), and it increased resting metabolic rate (RMR) by 203 ± 40 kcal/day (+13%; p = 0.001). BAT metabolic activity was also a significant predictor of the changes in RMR (p = 0.006). Therefore, a β3-AR agonist can stimulate human BAT thermogenesis and may be a promising treatment for metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells comprise a heterogeneous population of cells important for pathogen defense and cancer surveillance. However, the functional significance of this diversity is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate through transcriptional profiling and functional studies that the activating receptor DNAM-1 (CD226) identifies two distinct NK cell functional subsets: DNAM-1+ and DNAM-1− NK cells. DNAM-1+ NK cells produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines, have enhanced interleukin 15 signaling, and proliferate vigorously. By contrast, DNAM-1− NK cells that differentiate from DNAM-1+ NK cells have greater expression of NK-cell-receptor-related genes and are higher producers of MIP1 chemokines. Collectively, our data reveal the existence of a functional program of NK cell maturation marked by DNAM-1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs that stimulate antitumor immunity are transforming cancer treatment but require optimization for maximum clinical impact. Here, we show that, unlike other immunoglobulin isotypes, human IgG2 (h2) imparts FcγR-independent agonistic activity to immune-stimulatory mAbs such as anti-CD40, -4-1BB, and -CD28. Activity is provided by a subfraction of h2, h2B, that is structurally constrained due its unique arrangement of hinge region disulfide bonds. Agonistic activity can be transferred from h2 to h1 by swapping their hinge and CH1 domains, and substitution of key hinge and CH1 cysteines generates homogenous h2 variants with distinct agonistic properties. This provides the exciting opportunity to engineer clinical reagents with defined therapeutic activity regardless of FcγR expression levels in the local microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) represent a diverse class of translation inhibitors that are often deregulated in cancer cells. 4E-BPs inhibit translation by competing with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E through an interface that consists of canonical and non-canonical eIF4E-binding motifs connected by a linker. The lack of high-resolution structures including the linkers, which contain phosphorylation sites, limits our understanding of how phosphorylation inhibits complex formation. Furthermore, the binding mechanism of the non-canonical motifs is poorly understood. Here, we present structures of human eIF4E bound to 4E-BP1 and fly eIF4E bound to Thor, 4E-T, and eIF4G. These structures reveal architectural elements that are unique to 4E-BPs and provide insight into the consequences of phosphorylation. Guided by these structures, we designed and crystallized a 4E-BP mimic that shows increased repressive activity. Our studies pave the way for the rational design of 4E-BP mimics as therapeutic tools to decrease translation during oncogenic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer bone micrometastases can remain asymptomatic for years before progressing into overt lesions. The biology of this process, including the microenvironment niche and supporting pathways, is unclear. We find that bone micrometastases predominantly reside in a niche that exhibits features of osteogenesis. Niche interactions are mediated by heterotypic adherens junctions (hAJs) involving cancer-derived E-cadherin and osteogenic N-cadherin, the disruption of which abolishes niche-conferred advantages. We elucidate that hAJ activates the mTOR pathway in cancer cells, which drives the progression from single cells to micrometastases. Human data set analyses support the roles of AJ and the mTOR pathway in bone colonization. Our study illuminates the initiation of bone colonization, and provides potential therapeutic targets to block progression toward osteolytic metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological lymphatic diseases mostly affect vessels in specific tissues, yet little is known about organ-specific regulation of the lymphatic vasculature. Here, we show that the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3)/p110α PI3-kinase signaling pathway is selectively required for the formation of mesenteric lymphatic vasculature. Using genetic lineage tracing, we demonstrate that part of the mesenteric lymphatic vasculature develops from cKit lineage cells of hemogenic endothelial origin through a process we define as lymphvasculogenesis. This is contrary to the current dogma that all mammalian lymphatic vessels form by sprouting from veins. Our results reveal vascular-bed-specific differences in the origin and mechanisms of vessel formation, which may critically underlie organ-specific manifestation of lymphatic dysfunction in disease. The progenitor cells identified in this study may be exploited to restore lymphatic function following cancer surgery, lymphedema, or tissue trauma.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to low-dose irradiation causes transiently elevated expression of the long ncRNA PARTICLE (gene PARTICLE, promoter of MAT2A-antisense radiation-induced circulating lncRNA). PARTICLE affords both a cytosolic scaffold for the tumor suppressor methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT2A) and a nuclear genetic platform for transcriptional repression. In situ hybridization discloses that PARTICLE and MAT2A associate together following irradiation. Bromouridine tracing and presence in exosomes indicate intercellular transport, and this is supported by ex vivo data from radiotherapy-treated patients. Surface plasmon resonance indicates that PARTICLE forms a DNA-lncRNA triplex upstream of a MAT2A promoter CpG island. We show that PARTICLE represses MAT2A via methylation and demonstrate that the radiation-induced PARTICLE interacts with the transcription-repressive complex proteins G9a and SUZ12 (subunit of PRC2). The interplay of PARTICLE with MAT2A implicates this lncRNA in intercellular communication and as a recruitment platform for gene-silencing machineries through triplex formation in response to irradiation.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess a distinct chromatin conformation maintained by specialized chromatin proteins. To identify chromatin regulators in ESCs, we developed a simple biochemical assay named D-CAP (differential chromatin-associated proteins), using brief micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin, followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using D-CAP, we identified several differentially chromatin-associated proteins between undifferentiated and differentiated ESCs, including the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCD1. SMARCD1 depletion in ESCs led to altered chromatin and enhanced endodermal differentiation. Gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses suggested that SMARCD1 is both an activator and a repressor and is enriched at developmental regulators and that its chromatin binding coincides with H3K27me3. SMARCD1 knockdown caused H3K27me3 redistribution and increased H3K4me3 around the transcription start site (TSS). One of the identified SMARCD1 targets was Klf4. In SMARCD1-knockdown clones, KLF4, as well as H3K4me3 at the Klf4 locus, remained high and H3K27me3 was abolished. These results propose a role for SMARCD1 in restricting pluripotency and activating lineage pathways by regulating H3K27 methylation.

Abstract: Histological and biochemical alterations induced in prostate by cypermethrin insecticide exposure were investigated in adult albino rats. 60mg/kg/day of cypermethrin were given orally to experimental group for 15 days then prostatic specimens were processed for light and electron microscopic examinations and for assessment of oxidative stress markers; prostatic glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPx) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Masson's trichrome and anti-α-actin antibodies immunohistochemical staining were done. Blood samples were collected for measurement of total and prostatic acid phosphatase enzymes. Morphometric and statistical analyses were conducted. Cypermethrin treated group showed decrease in acinar epithelial height with detection of heterochromatic nuclei, cytoplasmic vacuolations and few apical microvilli. The stroma surrounding the acini was widened with significant increase in collagen fibers and significant decrease in smooth muscle cell α-actin immunoexpression. This was accompanied by a significant decrease of prostatic GSH level, activity of GPx enzyme with a significant increase in MDA level. Significant decrease in total and prostatic enzyme activities was also detected. In conclusion, cypermethrin induced epithelial degenerative changes in prostate which were accompanied by stromal alterations that seemed to be due to oxidative stress. More attention is required to the role of stromal microenvironment and oxidative stress markers in prostatic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Secreted Wnt morphogens are essential for embryogenesis and homeostasis and require a lipid/palmitoleoylate modification for receptor binding and activity. Notum is a secreted Wnt antagonist that belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily, but its mechanism of action and roles in vertebrate embryogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we report that Notum hydrolyzes the Wnt palmitoleoylate adduct extracellularly, resulting in inactivated Wnt proteins that form oxidized oligomers incapable of receptor binding. Thus, Notum is a Wnt deacylase, and palmitoleoylation is obligatory for the Wnt structure that maintains its active monomeric conformation. Notum is expressed in naive ectoderm and neural plate in Xenopus and is required for neural and head induction. These findings suggest that Notum is a prerequisite for the “default” neural fate and that distinct mechanisms of Wnt inactivation by the Tiki protease in the Organizer and the Notum deacylase in presumptive neuroectoderm orchestrate vertebrate brain development.

Abstract: In this research, mouse BMMSCs were isolated from bone marrow, induced to differentiate into neurogenic cells in vitro, and transplanted into the injured spinal cord after over-expression of miR-124. The results showed that the BMMSCs could induce the differentiation to neurogenic cells under the special condition medium, but when the miR-124 was over-expressed, the differentiation efficiency of neurogenic cells from BMMSCs could be promoted. This reason was demonstrated that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) showed a repressor for polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2) during neuronal differentiation, miR-124 reduces PTBP1 levels, leading to the accumulation of correctly spliced PTBP2 mRNA and a dramatic increase in PTBP2 protein. miR-124 promoted neurogenic cells from BMMSCs were successful colonized into injured spinal cord for participation in tissue-repair. In conclusion, our research shows that the miR-124 promoted the differentiation of neuronal cells from BMMSCs, and this mechanism was miR-124 reduced the expression of PTBP1, increased the expression of PTBP2.

Abstract: Summary
During cerebellar development, the main portion of the cerebellar plate neuroepithelium gives birth to Purkinje cells and interneurons, whereas the rhombic lip, the germinal zone at its dorsal edge, generates granule cells and cerebellar nuclei neurons. However, it remains elusive how these components cooperate to form the intricate cerebellar structure. Here, we found that a polarized cerebellar structure self-organizes in 3D human embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture. The self-organized neuroepithelium differentiates into electrophysiologically functional Purkinje cells. The addition of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) promotes spontaneous generation of dorsoventrally polarized neural-tube-like structures at the level of the cerebellum. Furthermore, addition of SDF1 and FGF19 promotes the generation of a continuous cerebellar plate neuroepithelium with rhombic-lip-like structure at one end and a three-layer cytoarchitecture similar to the embryonic cerebellum. Thus, human-ESC-derived cerebellar progenitors exhibit substantial self-organizing potential for generating a polarized structure reminiscent of the early human cerebellum at the first trimester.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary potassium deficiency, common in modern diets, raises blood pressure and enhances salt sensitivity. Potassium homeostasis requires a molecular switch in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), which fails in familial hyperkalemic hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2), activating the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter, NCC. Here, we show that dietary potassium deficiency activates NCC, even in the setting of high salt intake, thereby causing sodium retention and a rise in blood pressure. The effect is dependent on plasma potassium, which modulates DCT cell membrane voltage and, in turn, intracellular chloride. Low intracellular chloride stimulates WNK kinases to activate NCC, limiting potassium losses, even at the expense of increased blood pressure. These data show that DCT cells, like adrenal cells, sense potassium via membrane voltage. In the DCT, hyperpolarization activates NCC via WNK kinases, whereas in the adrenal gland, it inhibits aldosterone secretion. These effects work in concert to maintain potassium homeostasis.

Hirudin promotes angiogenesis by modulating the cross-talk between p38 MAPK and ERK in rat ischemic skin flap tissue,

Abstract: Hirudin's ability to increase angiogenesis in ischemic flap tissue and improve the flaps survival has been demonstrated in our previous studies. However, the knowledge about hirudin functional role in angiogenesis is still limited. In the present study, we investigate the effects of locally injected hirudin on the expression of VEGF, endostatin and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) using rat model. Caudally based dorsal skin flaps were created and were treated with hirudin or normal saline. Result showed that the flap survival was improved by hirudin treatment relative to the control. Treatment of flaps with hirudin exerted significant angiogenic effect as evidenced by increased VEGF expression and reduced endostatin and TSP-1 production (p<0.01), and promoted neovascularization (microvascular density, p<0.01). Moreover, hirudin treatment increased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while attenuated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and the addition of thrombin could reverse these effects of hirudin on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activity. The MEK inhibitor blocked the hirudin-induced VEGF expression, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor attenuated the thrombin-induced TSP-1 expression. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK activates ERK1/2 in ischemic flaps, suggesting that cross-talk between p38 MAPK and ERK might exist in rat ischemic flap tissue. Moreover, either the hirudin or SCH79797 (PAR1 antagonist) could attenuate the p38 MAPK phosphorylation and increases the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the cross-talk between p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 modulated by thrombin/PAR1 signaling may participate in the process of hirudin-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling. In conclusion, these observations suggest that hirudin exerts its angiogenesis effect by regulating the expression of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors via a cross-talk of p38 MAPK-ERK pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing relies on the poorly understood dynamic interplay between >150 protein components of the spliceosome. The steps at which splicing can be regulated remain largely unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and used this information to reconstruct a network of functional interactions. The network accurately captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones, revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components, related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds light on the antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 occur in ∼11% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the most common adult myeloid malignancy. It is unclear how these mutations contribute to disease. We examined in vivo hematopoietic consequences of the most common U2AF1 mutation using a doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse model. Mice expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F) display altered hematopoiesis and changes in pre-mRNA splicing in hematopoietic progenitor cells by whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq). Integration with human RNA-seq datasets determined that common mutant U2AF1-induced splicing alterations are enriched in RNA processing genes, ribosomal genes, and recurrently mutated MDS and acute myeloid leukemia-associated genes. These findings support the hypothesis that mutant U2AF1 alters downstream gene isoform expression, thereby contributing to abnormal hematopoiesis in patients with MDS.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination regulates numerous cellular processes by generating a versatile communication system based on eight structurally and functionally different chains linked through distinct residues. Except for K48 and K63, the biological relevance of different linkages is largely unclear. Here, we show that RNF168 ubiquitin ligase promotes noncanonical K27-linked ubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that residue K27 of ubiquitin (UbK27) is required for RNF168-dependent chromatin ubiquitination, by targeting histones H2A/H2A.X, and that it is the major ubiquitin-based modification marking chromatin upon DNA damage. Indeed, UbK27 is strictly required for the proper activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and is directly recognized by crucial DDR mediators, namely 53BP1, Rap80, RNF168, and RNF169. Mutation of UbK27 has dramatic consequences on DDR activation, preventing the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DDR foci. Similarly to the DDR, atypical ubiquitin chains could play unanticipated roles in other crucial ubiquitin-mediated biological processes.

Abstract: Live cell imaging has revealed that calcium ions (Ca2+) pass in and out of many cellular organelles. However, technical hurdles have limited measurements of Ca2+ in acidic organelles, such as endosomes. Although evidence hints that endosomes play a role in Ca2+ signaling, direct measurements within endosomal lumina represent one of the final frontiers in organelle imaging. To measure Ca2+ in a TiVAMP-positive endosome sub-population, the pH-resistant ratiometric Ca2+ biosensor GEM-GECO1 and the ratiometric pH biosensor mKeima were used. A positive correlation between acidic endosomal pH and higher Ca2+ was observed within these Rab5a- and Rab7-positive compartments. Ca2+ concentration in most endosomes was estimated to be below 2μM, lower than Ca2+ levels in several other intracellular stores, indicating that endosomes may take up Ca2+ during physiological stimulation. Indeed, endosomes accumulated Ca2+ during glucose-stimulation, a condition where endosomal pH did not change. Our biosensors permitted the first measurements revealing a role for endosomes in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis during physiological stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane receptors at the surface of target cells are key host factors for virion entry; however, it is unknown whether trafficking and secretion of progeny virus requires host intracellular receptors. In this study, we demonstrate that dengue virus (DENV) interacts with KDEL receptors (KDELR), which cycle between the ER and Golgi apparatus, for vesicular transport from ER to Golgi. Depletion of KDELR by siRNA reduced egress of both DENV progeny and recombinant subviral particles (RSPs). Coimmunoprecipitation of KDELR with dengue structural protein prM required three positively charged residues at the N terminus, whose mutation disrupted protein interaction and inhibited RSP transport from the ER to the Golgi. Finally, siRNA depletion of class II Arfs, which results in KDELR accumulation in the Golgi, phenocopied results obtained with mutagenized prME and KDELR knockdown. Our results have uncovered a function for KDELR as an internal receptor involved in DENV trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
DNA wrapping around histone octamers generates nucleosomes, the basic compaction unit of eukaryotic chromatin. Nucleosome stability is carefully tuned to maintain DNA accessibility in transcription, replication, and repair. Using freely orbiting magnetic tweezers, which measure the twist and length of single DNA molecules, we monitor the real-time loading of tetramers or complete histone octamers onto DNA by Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (NAP1). Remarkably, we find that tetrasomes exhibit spontaneous flipping between a preferentially occupied left-handed state (ΔLk = −0.73) and a right-handed state (ΔLk = +1.0), separated by a free energy difference of 2.3 kBT (1.5 kcal/mol). This flipping occurs without concomitant changes in DNA end-to-end length. The application of weak positive torque converts left-handed tetrasomes into right-handed tetrasomes, whereas nucleosomes display more gradual conformational changes. Our findings reveal unexpected dynamical rearrangements of the nucleosomal structure, suggesting that chromatin can serve as a “twist reservoir,” offering a mechanistic explanation for the regulation of DNA supercoiling in chromatin.

Abstract: The main objective of this study was to investigate the structure of the Harderian gland (HG) in male and female guinea pigs. A total number of sixteen animals of 4 months age were divided according to sex into two groups; eight animals each. Unfixed glands were weighed and their length and width were measured. Specimens from fixed glands were processed and examined using light, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for the detection of the presence of chromogranin A (CgA). The gland consisted of a well-developed duct system which included both intra and extra parenchymal ducts and secretory end pieces lined by many types of cells of variable morphological features and modes of secretion. However, the holocrine mode of secretion was rare as mitotic figures were occasionally present. The interstitial cells included fibroblasts and immune cells (mast cells, lymphocyte, plasma cells and macrophages). The secretion produced by the gland included lipid, protein, neutral mucin and CgA which may be a newly identified constituent of biologically potent proteins stored in the cells of the guinea pig HG. Neutral mucin and CgA may function in photoprotection. The gland revealed sexual dimorphism in mast cells and blood capillaries number and chromogranin secretory activity.

Abstract: Summary
Antiangiogenic therapy is commonly used in the clinic, but its beneficial effects are short-lived, leading to tumor relapse within months. Here, we found that the efficacy of angiogenic inhibitors targeting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway was dependent on induction of the angiostatic and immune-stimulatory chemokine CXCL14 in mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine and mammary tumors. In response, tumors reinitiated angiogenesis and immune suppression by activating PI3K signaling in all CD11b+ cells, rendering tumors nonresponsive to VEGF/VEGFR inhibition. Adaptive resistance was also associated with an increase in Gr1+CD11b+ cells, but targeting Gr1+ cells was not sufficient to further sensitize angiogenic blockade because tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) would compensate for the lack of such cells and vice versa, leading to an oscillating pattern of distinct immune-cell populations. However, PI3K inhibition in CD11b+ myeloid cells generated an enduring angiostatic and immune-stimulatory environment in which antiangiogenic therapy remained efficient.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen receptor (ER/ESR1) is a transcription factor critical for development, reproduction, metabolism, and cancer. ER function hinges on its ability to recruit primary and secondary coactivators, yet structural information on the full-length receptor-coactivator complex to complement preexisting and sometimes controversial biochemical information is lacking. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the quaternary structure of an active complex of DNA-bound ERα, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3/NCOA3), and a secondary coactivator (p300/EP300). Our structural model suggests the following assembly mechanism for the complex: each of the two ligand-bound ERα monomers independently recruits one SRC-3 protein via the transactivation domain of ERα; the two SRC-3s in turn bind to different regions of one p300 protein through multiple contacts. We also present structural evidence for the location of activation function 1 (AF-1) in a full-length nuclear receptor, which supports a role for AF-1 in SRC-3 recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly all forms of hereditary hemochromatosis are characterized by pathological iron accumulation in the liver, pancreas, and heart. These tissues preferentially load iron because they take up non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which appears in the plasma during iron overload. Yet, how tissues take up NTBI is largely unknown. We report that ablation of Slc39a14, the gene coding for solute carrier SLC39A14 (also called ZIP14), in mice markedly reduced the uptake of plasma NTBI by the liver and pancreas. To test the role of SLC39A14 in tissue iron loading, we crossed Slc39a14−/− mice with Hfe−/− and Hfe2−/− mice, animal models of type 1 and type 2 (juvenile) hemochromatosis, respectively. Slc39a14 deficiency in hemochromatotic mice greatly diminished iron loading of the liver and prevented iron deposition in hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells. The data suggest that inhibition of SLC39A14 may mitigate hepatic and pancreatic iron loading and associated pathologies in iron overload disorders.

Abstract: Background
Currently, direct conversion from somatic cells to neurons requires virus-mediated delivery of at least one transcriptional factor or a combination of several small-molecule compounds. Delivery of transcriptional factors may affect genome stability, while small-molecule compounds may require more evaluations when applied in vivo. Thus, a defined medium with only conventional growth factors or additives for cell culture is desirable for inducing neuronal trans-differentiation.
Results
Here, we report that a defined medium (5C) consisting of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), N2 supplement, leukemia inhibitory factor, vitamin C (Vc), and β-mercaptoethanol (βMe) induces the direct conversion of somatic cells to cells with neuronal characteristics. Application of 5C medium converted mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into TuJ+ neuronal-like cells, which were capable of survival after being transplanted into the mouse brain. The same 5C medium could convert primary rat astrocytes into neuronal-like cells with mature electrophysiology characteristics in vitro and facilitated the recovery of brain injury, possibly by inducing similar conversions, when infused into the mouse brain in vivo. Crucially, 5C medium could also induce neuronal characteristics in several human cell types.
Conclusions
In summary, this 5C medium not only provides a means to derive cells with neuronal characteristics without viral transfection in vitro but might also be useful to produce neurons in vivo for neurodegenerative disease treatment.

Abstract: The mature Helicometroides atlanticus spermatozoon exhibits an anterior electron-dense material, two axonemes of the 9+“1” pattern, a nucleus, two mitochondria, extramembranous ornamentations located at the level of the first mitochondrion and cortical microtubules arranged into two fields: a ventral field corresponding to the mitochondrial side and a dorsal field corresponding to the nuclear side. It lacks of spine-like body and a cytoplasmic expansion as in Monorchis parvus the only species of Monorchioidea which spermatozoon has been described until now. Nevertheless, it is distinguished from M. parvus by the presence of an anterior electron-dense material and two axonemes which appear one after the other.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ubiquitination regulates many cellular processes via attachment of structurally and functionally distinct ubiquitin (Ub) chains. Several atypical chain types have remained poorly characterized because the enzymes mediating their assembly and receptors with specific binding properties have been elusive. We found that the human HECT E3 ligases UBE3C and AREL1 assemble K48/K29- and K11/K33-linked Ub chains, respectively, and can be used in combination with DUBs to generate K29- and K33-linked chains for biochemical and structural analyses. Solution studies indicate that both chains adopt open and dynamic conformations. We further show that the N-terminal Npl4-like zinc finger (NZF1) domain of the K29/K33-specific deubiquitinase TRABID specifically binds K29/K33-linked diUb, and a crystal structure of this complex explains TRABID specificity and suggests a model for chain binding by TRABID. Our work uncovers linkage-specific components in the Ub system for atypical K29- and K33-linked Ub chains, providing tools to further understand these unstudied posttranslational modifications.

Abstract: Glucose-dependent cytosolic Na+ influx in pancreatic islet β cells is mediated by TTX-sensitive Na+ channels and is propagated into the mitochondria through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX. Mitochondrial Na+ transients are also controlled by the mitochondrial Na+/H+ exchanger, NHE, while cytosolic Na+ changes are governed by Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The functional interaction between the Na+ channels, Na+/K+ ATPase pump and mitochondrial Na+ transporters, NCLX and NHE, in mediating Na+ signaling is poorly understood. Here, we combine fluorescent Na+ imaging, pharmacological inhibition by TTX, ouabain and EIPA, with molecular control of NCLX expression, so as to investigate the crosstalk between Na+ transporters on both the plasma membrane and the mitochondria. According to our results, glucose-dependent cytosolic Na+ response was enhanced by ouabain and was followed by a rise in mitochondrial Na+ signal. Silencing of NCLX expression using siNCLX, did not affect the glucose- or ouabain-dependent cytosolic rise in Na+. In contrast, the ouabain-dependent rise in mitochondrial Na+ was strongly suppressed by siNCLX. Furthermore, mitochondrial Na+ influx rates were accelerated in cells treated with the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor, EIPA or by combination of EIPA and ouabain. Similarly, TTX blocked the cytosolic and mitochondrial Na+ responses, which were enhanced by ouabain or EIPA, respectively. Our results suggest that Na+/K+ ATPase pump controls cytosolic glucose-dependent Na+ rise, in a manner that is mediated by TTX-sensitive Na+ channels and subsequent mitochondrial Na+ uptake via NCLX. Furthermore, these results indicate that mitochondrial Na+ influx via NCLX is antagonized by Na+ efflux, which is mediated by the mitochondrial NHE; thus, the duration of mitochondrial Na+ transients is set by the interplay between these pivotal transporters.

Cotranslational Stabilization of Sec62/63 within the ER Sec61 Translocon Is Controlled by Distinct Substrate-Driven Translocation Events,

Abstract: Summary
The ER Sec61 translocon is a large macromolecular machine responsible for partitioning secretory and membrane polypeptides into the lumen, cytosol, and lipid bilayer. Because the Sec61 protein-conducting channel has been isolated in multiple membrane-derived complexes, we determined how the nascent polypeptide modulates translocon component associations during defined cotranslational translocation events. The model substrate preprolactin (pPL) was isolated principally with Sec61αβγ upon membrane targeting, whereas higher-order complexes containing OST, TRAP, and TRAM were stabilized following substrate translocation. Blocking pPL translocation by passenger domain folding favored stabilization of an alternate complex that contained Sec61, Sec62, and Sec63. Moreover, Sec62/63 stabilization within the translocon occurred for native endogenous substrates, such as the prion protein, and correlated with a delay in translocation initiation. These data show that cotranslational translocon contacts are ultimately controlled by the engaged nascent chain and the resultant substrate-driven translocation events.

Abstract: Summary
Anillins and Mid1 are scaffold proteins that play key roles in anchorage of the contractile ring at the cell equator during cytokinesis in animals and fungi, respectively. Here, we report crystal structures and functional analysis of human anillin and S. pombe Mid1. The combined data show anillin contains a cryptic C2 domain and a Rho-binding domain. Together with the tethering PH domain, three membrane-associating elements synergistically bind to RhoA and phospholipids to anchor anillin at the cleavage furrow. Surprisingly, Mid1 also binds to the membrane through a cryptic C2 domain. Dimerization of Mid1 leads to high affinity and preference for PI(4,5)P2, which stably anchors Mid1 at the division plane, bypassing the requirement for Rho GTPase. These findings uncover the unexpected general machinery and the divergent regulatory logics for the anchorage of the contractile ring through the anillin/Mid1 family proteins from yeast to humans.

Abstract: Summary
Maximal exercise-associated oxidative capacity is strongly correlated with health and longevity in humans. Rats selectively bred for high running capacity (HCR) have improved metabolic health and are longer-lived than their low-capacity counterparts (LCR). Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling, we show that HCR efficiently oxidize fatty acids (FAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), sparing glycogen and reducing accumulation of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines. HCR mitochondria have reduced acetylation of mitochondrial proteins within oxidative pathways at rest, and there is rapid protein deacetylation with exercise, which is greater in HCR than LCR. Fluxomic analysis of valine degradation with exercise demonstrates a functional role of differential protein acetylation in HCR and LCR. Our data suggest that efficient FA and BCAA utilization contribute to high intrinsic exercise capacity and the health and longevity benefits associated with enhanced fitness.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear size changes dynamically during development and has long been observed to correlate with the space surrounding the nucleus, as well as with the volume of the cell. Here we combine an in vitro cell-free system of Xenopus laevis egg extract with microfluidic devices to systematically analyze the effect of spatial constraints. The speed of nuclear expansion depended on the available space surrounding the nucleus up to a threshold volume in the nanoliter range, herein referred to as the nuclear domain. Under spatial constraints smaller than this nuclear domain, the size of microtubule-occupied space surrounding the nucleus turned out to be limiting for the accumulation of membranes around the nucleus via the motor protein dynein, therefore determining the speed of nuclear expansion. This mechanism explains how spatial information surrounding the nucleus, such as the positioning of the nucleus inside the cell, can control nuclear expansion.

Abstract: Summary
YAP (yes-associated protein) and TAZ are oncogenic transcriptional co-activators downstream of the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway. However, whether YAP and/or TAZ (YAP/TAZ) engage in transcriptional co-repression remains relatively unexplored. Here, we directly demonstrated that YAP/TAZ represses numerous target genes, including tumor-suppressor genes such as DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) and Trail (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Mechanistically, the repressor function of YAP/TAZ requires TEAD (TEA domain) transcription factors. A YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex recruits the NuRD complex to deacetylate histones and alters nucleosome occupancy at target genes. Functionally, repression of DDIT4 and Trail by YAP/TAZ is required for mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) activation and cell survival, respectively. Our demonstration of the transcriptional co-repressor activity of YAP/TAZ opens a new avenue for understanding the Hippo signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection rewires host-cell metabolism, upregulating flux from glucose into acetyl-CoA to feed fatty acid metabolism, with saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLFCAs) required for production of infectious virion progeny. The human genome encodes seven elongase enzymes (ELOVL) that extend long-chain fatty acids into VLCFA. Here, we identify ELOVL7 as pivotal for HCMV infection. HCMV induces ELOVL7 by more than 150-fold. This induction is dependent on mTOR and SREBP-1. ELOVL7 knockdown or mTOR inhibition impairs HCMV-induced fatty acid elongation, HCMV particle release, and infectivity per particle. ELOVL7 overexpression enhances HCMV replication. During HCMV infection, mTOR activity is maintained by the viral protein pUL38. Expression of pUL38 is sufficient to induce ELOVL7, and pUL38-deficient virus is partially defective in ELOVL7 induction and fatty acid elongation. Thus, through its ability to modulate mTOR and SREBP-1, HCMV induces ELOVL7 to synthesize the saturated VLCFA required for efficient virus replication.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations affecting spliceosomal proteins are the most common mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but their role in MDS pathogenesis has not been delineated. Here we report that mutations affecting the splicing factor SRSF2 directly impair hematopoietic differentiation in vivo, which is not due to SRSF2 loss of function. By contrast, SRSF2 mutations alter SRSF2’s normal sequence-specific RNA binding activity, thereby altering the recognition of specific exonic splicing enhancer motifs to drive recurrent mis-splicing of key hematopoietic regulators. This includes SRSF2 mutation-dependent splicing of EZH2, which triggers nonsense-mediated decay, which, in turn, results in impaired hematopoietic differentiation. These data provide a mechanistic link between a mutant spliceosomal protein, alterations in the splicing of key regulators, and impaired hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune system senses cytosolic dsDNA and bacterial cyclic dinucleotides and initiates signaling via the adaptor STING to induce type 1 interferon (IFN) response. We demonstrate here that BTK-deficient cells have impaired IFN-β production and TBK1/IRF3 activation when stimulated with agonists or infected with pathogens that activate STING signaling. BTK interacts with STING and DDX41 helicase. The kinase and SH3/SH2 interaction domains of BTK bind, respectively, the DEAD-box domain of DDX41 and transmembrane region of STING. BTK phosphorylates DDX41, and its kinase activities are critical for STING-mediated IFN-β production. We show that Tyr364 and Tyr414 of DDX41 are critical for its recognition of AT-rich DNA and binding to STING, and tandem mass spectrometry identifies Tyr414 as the BTK phosphorylation site. Modeling studies further indicate that phospho-Tyr414 strengthens DDX41’s interaction with STING. Hence, BTK plays a critical role in the activation of DDX41 helicase and STING signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory dendrites innervate peripheral tissues through cell-cell interactions that are poorly understood. The proprioceptive neuron PVD in C. elegans extends regular terminal dendritic branches between muscle and hypodermis. We found that the PVD branch pattern was instructed by adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM, which formed regularly spaced stripes on the hypodermal cell. The regularity of the SAX-7 pattern originated from the repeated and regularly spaced dense body of the sarcomeres in the muscle. The extracellular proteoglycan UNC-52/Perlecan linked the dense body to the hemidesmosome on the hypodermal cells, which in turn instructed the SAX-7 stripes and PVD dendrites. Both UNC-52 and hemidesmosome components exhibited highly regular stripes that interdigitated with the SAX-7 stripe and PVD dendrites, reflecting the striking precision of subcellular patterning between muscle, hypodermis, and dendrites. Hence, the muscular contractile apparatus provides the instructive cues to pattern proprioceptive dendrites.

Abstract: Rat skins were deepithelialized and decellularized by hypertonic saline and sodium deoxycholate (SDC), respectively. Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (P-CEF) were cultured and seeded on prepared acellular dermal matrix (ADM). A full thickness skin defect (20×20mm2) was created in thirty-six rats and randomly divided into three equal groups. Defect was left open, repaired with ADM and ADM seeded with P-CEF (3-D ADM) in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. By day 28, the treated wounds healed completely without scar. By day 7 hydroxyproline contents was higher in group 3 as compared to groups 1 and 2. There was slightly more B cell response in animals implanted with ADM and 3-D ADM. At day 21, stimulation index was lower with acellular dermis antigen as compared to 3-D ADM antigen. In group 1 on day 3, the granulation tissue showed more inflammatory reaction, fibroplasia and neovascularization as compared to group 2 and 3. By day 28, there was complete epithelization was observed in all groups over. However, a large scar was observed in group 1. The graft was completely absorbed and replaced with densely thick and best arranged collagen fibers. On day 7, malonyldialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly (P<0.05) increased in group 1. Reduced glutathione values increased and reached to near normal in groups 2 and 3. Catalase values were significantly (P<0.05) higher in group 1 at different time intervals. SEM samples of group 2 showed ingrowth of fibroblasts into acellular matrix at host graft junction. However, in group 3 fibroblasts were infiltrated within the pores of graft. It was concluded that P-CEF cells seeded ADM facilitated early and better healing.

Abstract: Summary
Trimethylation at histone H3K27 is central to the polycomb repression system. Juxtaposed to H3K27 is a widely conserved phosphorylatable serine residue (H3S28) whose function is unclear. To assess the importance of H3S28, we generated a Drosophila H3 histone mutant with a serine-to-alanine mutation at position 28. H3S28A mutant cells lack H3S28ph on mitotic chromosomes but support normal mitosis. Strikingly, all methylation states of H3K27 drop in H3S28A cells, leading to Hox gene derepression and to homeotic transformations in adult tissues. These defects are not caused by active H3K27 demethylation nor by the loss of H3S28ph. Biochemical assays show that H3S28A nucleosomes are a suboptimal substrate for PRC2, suggesting that the unphosphorylated state of serine 28 is important for assisting in the function of polycomb complexes. Collectively, our data indicate that the conserved H3S28 residue in metazoans has a role in supporting PRC2 catalysis.

Abstract: Summary
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients occasionally develop diabetes mellitus. However, only limited attempts have been made to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of diabetes mellitus development in A-T patients. We found that Atm−/− mice were insulin resistant and possessed less subcutaneous adipose tissue as well as a lower level of serum adiponectin than Atm+/+ mice. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed impaired adipocyte differentiation in Atm−/− cells caused by the lack of induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ, crucial transcription factors involved in adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, ATM was activated by stimuli that induced differentiation, and the binding of ATM to C/EBPβ and p300 was involved in the transcriptional regulation of C/EBPα and adipocyte differentiation. Thus, our study sheds light on the poorly understood role of ATM in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in A-T patients and provides insight into the role of ATM in glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Although oncogene-targeted therapy often elicits profound initial tumor responses in patients, responses are generally incomplete because some tumor cells survive initial therapy as residual disease that enables eventual acquired resistance. The mechanisms underlying tumor cell adaptation and survival during initial therapy are incompletely understood. Here, through the study of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, we show that NF-κB signaling is rapidly engaged upon initial EGFR inhibitor treatment to promote tumor cell survival and residual disease. EGFR oncogene inhibition induced an EGFR-TRAF2-RIP1-IKK complex that stimulated an NF-κB-mediated transcriptional survival program. The direct NF-κB inhibitor PBS-1086 suppressed this adaptive survival program and increased the magnitude and duration of initial EGFR inhibitor response in multiple NSCLC models, including a patient-derived xenograft. These findings unveil NF-κB activation as a critical adaptive survival mechanism engaged by EGFR oncogene inhibition and provide rationale for EGFR and NF-κB co-inhibition to eliminate residual disease and enhance patient responses.

Abstract: The ultrastructural organization of the spermatozoon of the digenean Tergestia acanthocephala (Gymnophalloidea: Fellodistomidae) is described. Live digeneans were collected from Belone belone gracilis (Teleostei: Belonidae), caught off the Gulf of Gabès in Chebba (Tunisia). The mature spermatozoon of T. acanthocephala exhibits the general pattern described in numerous digeneans, characterized by the presence of two axonemes of the different length of the 9+‘1’ pattern of the Trepaxonemata, a nucleus, two mitochondria, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules, external ornamentation, spine-like bodies and granules of glycogen. Moreover, the morphology of the posterior spermatozoon extremity in T. acanthocephala corresponds to the fasciolidean type of Quilichini et al. (2010a).

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between mitogenic and proinflammatory signaling pathways plays key roles in determining the phenotypes and clinical outcomes of breast cancers. Using GRO-seq in MCF-7 cells, we defined the immediate transcriptional effects of crosstalk between estradiol (E2) and TNFα, identifying a large set of target genes whose expression is rapidly altered with combined E2 + TNFα treatment, but not with either agent alone. The pleiotropic effects on gene transcription in response to E2 + TNFα are orchestrated by extensive remodeling of the ERα enhancer landscape in an NF-κB- and FoxA1-dependent manner. In addition, expression of the de novo and synergistically regulated genes is strongly associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancers. Together, our genomic and molecular analyses indicate that TNFα signaling, acting in pathways culminating in the redistribution of NF-κB and FoxA1 binding sites across the genome, creates latent ERα binding sites that underlie altered patterns of gene expression and clinically relevant cellular responses.

Abstract: Summary
The tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2 are key integrators of growth factor signaling. They suppress cell growth and proliferation by acting in a heteromeric complex to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In this study, we identify TSC1 as a component of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-Smad2/3 pathway. Here, TSC1 functions independently of TSC2. TSC1 interacts with the TGF-β receptor complex and Smad2/3 and is required for their association with one another. TSC1 regulates TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and target gene expression and controls TGF-β-induced growth arrest and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hyperactive Akt specifically activates TSC1-dependent cytostatic Smad signaling to induce growth arrest. Thus, TSC1 couples Akt activity to TGF-β-Smad2/3 signaling. This has implications for cancer treatments targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinases and Akt because they may impair tumor-suppressive cytostatic TGF-β signaling by inhibiting Akt- and TSC1-dependent Smad activation.

Multiple Mechanisms of Reinitiation on Bicistronic Calicivirus mRNAs,

Abstract: Summary
Reinitiation is a strategy used by viruses to express several cistrons from one mRNA. Although extremely weak after translation of long open reading frames (ORFs) on cellular mRNAs, reinitiation occurs efficiently on subgenomic bicistronic calicivirus mRNAs, enabling synthesis of minor capsid proteins. The process is governed by a short element upstream of the restart AUG, designated “termination upstream ribosomal binding site” (TURBS). It contains the conserved Motif 1 complementary to h26 of 18S rRNA, displayed in the loop of a hairpin formed by species-specific Motifs 2/2∗. To determine the advantages conferred on reinitiation by TURBS, we reconstituted this process in vitro on two model bicistronic calicivirus mRNAs. We found that post-termination ribosomal tethering of mRNA by TURBS allows reinitiation by post-termination 80S ribosomes and diminishes dependence on eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) of reinitiation by recycled 40S subunits, which can be mediated either by eIFs 2/1/1A or by Ligatin following ABCE1-dependent or -independent splitting of post-termination complexes.

Blocking IL-6 trans-Signaling Prevents High-Fat Diet-Induced Adipose Tissue Macrophage Recruitment but Does Not Improve Insulin Resistance,

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a paradoxical role in inflammation and metabolism. The pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6 are mediated via IL-6 “trans-signaling,” a process where the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) binds IL-6 and activates signaling in inflammatory cells that express the gp130 but not the IL-6 receptor. Here we show that trans-signaling recruits macrophages into adipose tissue (ATM). Moreover, blocking trans-signaling with soluble gp130Fc protein prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced ATM accumulation, but does not improve insulin action. Importantly, however, blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling, unlike complete ablation of IL-6 signaling, does not exacerbate obesity-induced weight gain, liver steatosis, or insulin resistance. Our data identify the sIL-6R as a critical chemotactic signal for ATM recruitment and suggest that selectively blocking IL-6 trans-signaling may be a more favorable treatment option for inflammatory diseases, compared with current treatments that completely block the action of IL-6 and negatively impact upon metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional response of β-actin to extra-cellular stimuli is a paradigm for transcription factor complex assembly and regulation. Serum induction leads to a precisely timed pulse of β-actin transcription in the cell population. Actin protein is proposed to be involved in this response, but it is not known whether cellular actin levels affect nuclear β-actin transcription. We perturbed the levels of key signaling factors and examined the effect on the induced transcriptional pulse by following endogenous β-actin alleles in single living cells. Lowering serum response factor (SRF) protein levels leads to loss of pulse integrity, whereas reducing actin protein levels reveals positive feedback regulation, resulting in elevated gene activation and a prolonged transcriptional response. Thus, transcriptional pulse fidelity requires regulated amounts of signaling proteins, and perturbations in factor levels eliminate the physiological response, resulting in either tuning down or exaggeration of the transcriptional pulse.

Abstract: Summary
Cells chemically isolate molecules in compartments to both facilitate and regulate their interactions. In addition to membrane-encapsulated compartments, cells can form proteinaceous and membraneless organelles, including nucleoli, Cajal and PML bodies, and stress granules. The principles that determine when and why these structures form have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the disordered tails of Ddx4, a primary constituent of nuage or germ granules, form phase-separated organelles both in live cells and in vitro. These bodies are stabilized by patterned electrostatic interactions that are highly sensitive to temperature, ionic strength, arginine methylation, and splicing. Sequence determinants are used to identify proteins found in both membraneless organelles and cell adhesion. Moreover, the bodies provide an alternative solvent environment that can concentrate single-stranded DNA but largely exclude double-stranded DNA. We propose that phase separation of disordered proteins containing weakly interacting blocks is a general mechanism for forming regulated, membraneless organelles.

Abstract: Summary
Common variants in WNT pathway genes have been associated with bone mass and fat distribution, the latter predicting diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk. Rare mutations in the WNT co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are similarly associated with bone and cardiometabolic disorders. We investigated the role of LRP5 in human adipose tissue. Subjects with gain-of-function LRP5 mutations and high bone mass had enhanced lower-body fat accumulation. Reciprocally, a low bone mineral density-associated common LRP5 allele correlated with increased abdominal adiposity. Ex vivo LRP5 expression was higher in abdominal versus gluteal adipocyte progenitors. Equivalent knockdown of LRP5 in both progenitor types dose-dependently impaired β-catenin signaling and led to distinct biological outcomes: diminished gluteal and enhanced abdominal adipogenesis. These data highlight how depot differences in WNT/β-catenin pathway activity modulate human fat distribution via effects on adipocyte progenitor biology. They also identify LRP5 as a potential pharmacologic target for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.
