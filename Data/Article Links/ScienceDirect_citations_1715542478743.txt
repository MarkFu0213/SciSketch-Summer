Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes degrade macromolecular cargos, recycle catabolites, and serve as signaling platforms to maintain cell homeostasis, but their role at the tissue level is unclear. Here, we investigate lysosome regulation and function during C. elegans molting, a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling process essential for larval development. We found that lysosomes are specifically activated in the epidermis at molt when the apical ECM (cuticle) is being replaced. Impaired lysosome function affects endocytic cargo degradation, suppresses elevated protein synthesis at molt, and causes molting defects. Disturbance of ECM-epidermis attachments triggers lysosomal activation and induces expression of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which is mediated by the GATA transcription factor ELT-3 and the STAT family protein STA-2. Our study reveals an ECM-to-nucleus signaling pathway that activates lysosomes to facilitate ECM remodeling essential for larval development.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic imaging using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance can increase the sensitivity of MRI, though its ability to inform on relevant changes to biochemistry in humans remains unclear. In this work, we image pyruvate metabolism in patients, assessing the reproducibility of delivery and conversion in the setting of primary prostate cancer. We show that the time to max of pyruvate does not vary significantly within patients undergoing two separate injections or across patients. Furthermore, we show that lactate increases with Gleason grade. RNA sequencing data demonstrate a significant increase in the predominant pyruvate uptake transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1. Increased protein expression was also observed in regions of high lactate signal, implicating it as the driver of lactate signal in vivo. Targeted DNA sequencing for actionable mutations revealed the highest lactate occurred in patients with PTEN loss. This work identifies a potential link between actionable genomic alterations and metabolic information derived from hyperpolarized pyruvate MRI.

Abstract: Summary
Iron is a central micronutrient needed by all living organisms. Competition for iron in the intestinal tract is essential for the maintenance of indigenous microbial populations and for host health. How symbiotic relationships between hosts and native microbes persist during times of iron limitation is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that indigenous bacteria possess an iron-dependent mechanism that inhibits host iron transport and storage. Using a high-throughput screen of microbial metabolites, we found that gut microbiota produce metabolites that suppress hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) a master transcription factor of intestinal iron absorption and increase the iron-storage protein ferritin, resulting in decreased intestinal iron absorption by the host. We identified 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) and reuterin as inhibitors of HIF-2α via inhibition of heterodimerization. DAP and reuterin effectively ameliorated systemic iron overload. This work provides evidence of intestine-microbiota metabolic crosstalk that is essential for systemic iron homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Human DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) forms a holoenzyme complex with the DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to perform its essential roles in genome replication. Here, we utilize live-cell single-molecule tracking to monitor Pol δ holoenzyme interaction with the genome in real time. We find holoenzyme assembly and disassembly in vivo are highly dynamic and ordered. PCNA generally loads onto the genome before Pol δ. Once assembled, the holoenzyme has a relatively short lifetime on the genome, implying multiple Pol δ binding events may be needed to synthesize an Okazaki fragment. During disassembly, Pol δ dissociation generally precedes PCNA unloading. We also find that Pol δ p125, the catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme, is maintained at a constant cellular level, indicating an active mechanism for control of Pol δ levels in vivo. Collectively, our studies reveal that Pol δ holoenzyme assembly and disassembly follow a predominant pathway in vivo; however, alternate pathways are observed.

Abstract: Summary
We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the α-globin locus at the single-allele level in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and erythroid cells, combining polymer physics models and high-resolution Capture-C data. Model predictions are validated against independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells the α-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain, arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation. The flanking regions are rich in convergent CTCF sites, which only marginally participate in the erythroid-specific gene-enhancer contacts, suggesting that beyond the interaction of CTCF sites, multiple molecular mechanisms cooperate to form an interacting domain.

Abstract: Intracellular [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i imbalance significantly contribute to neuro-axonal dysfunctions and maladaptive myelin repair or remyelination failure in chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Progress in recent years has led to significant advances in understanding how [Ca2+]i signaling network drive degeneration or remyelination of demyelinated axons. The Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs), a transmembrane protein family including three members encoded by ncx1, ncx2, and ncx3 genes, are emerging important regulators of [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i both in neurons and glial cells. Here we review recent advance highlighting the role of NCX exchangers in axons and myelin-forming cells, i.e. oligodendrocytes, which represent the major targets of the aberrant inflammatory attack in multiple sclerosis. The contribution of NCX subtypes to axonal pathology and myelin synthesis will be discussed. Although a definitive understanding of mechanisms regulating axonal pathology and remyelination failure in chronic demyelinating diseases is still lacking and requires further investigation, current knowledge suggest that NCX activity plays a crucial role in these processes. Defining the relative contributions of each NCX transporter in axon pathology and myelinating glia will constitute not only a major advance in understanding in detail the intricate mechanism of neurodegeneration and remyelination failure in demyelinating diseases but also will help to identify neuroprotective or remyelinating strategies targeting selective NCX exchangers as a means of treating MS.

Abstract: Summary
Frequent mutation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway genes in human cancers has stimulated large investments in targeted drugs but clinical successes are rare. As a result, many cancers with high PI3K pathway activity, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are treated primarily with chemotherapy. By systematically analyzing responses of TNBC cells to a diverse collection of PI3K pathway inhibitors, we find that one drug, Torin2, is unusually effective because it inhibits both mTOR and other PI3K-like kinases (PIKKs). In contrast to mTOR-selective inhibitors, Torin2 exploits dependencies on several kinases for S-phase progression and cell-cycle checkpoints, thereby causing accumulation of single-stranded DNA and death by replication catastrophe or mitotic failure. Thus, Torin2 and its chemical analogs represent a mechanistically distinct class of PI3K pathway inhibitors that are uniquely cytotoxic to TNBC cells. This insight could be translated therapeutically by further developing Torin2 analogs or combinations of existing mTOR and PIKK inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrients stimulate the anabolic synthesis of proteins and lipids, but selective insulin resistance in obesity biases the anabolic program toward lipogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a DNAJB9-driven program that favors protein synthesis and energy production over lipid accumulation. We show there are two pools of DNAJB9 cochaperone. DNAJB9 in the ER lumen promotes the degradation of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1c through ERAD, whereas its counterpart on the ER membrane promotes the assembly of mTORC2 in the cytosol and stimulates the synthesis of proteins and ATP. The expression of Dnajb9 is induced by nutrients and downregulated in the obese mouse liver. Restoration of hepatic DNAJB9 expression effectively improves insulin sensitivity, restores protein synthesis, and suppresses food intake, accompanied by reduced hepatic steatosis and adiposity in multiple mouse models of obesity. Therefore, targeting the anabolic balance may provide a unique opportunity to tackle obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer evolution poses a central obstacle to cure, as resistant clones expand under therapeutic selection pressures. Genome sequencing of relapsed disease can nominate genomic alterations conferring resistance but sample collection lags behind, limiting therapeutic innovation. Genome-wide screens offer a complementary approach to chart the compendium of escape genotypes, anticipating clinical resistance. We report genome-wide open reading frame (ORF) resistance screens for first- and third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and a MEK inhibitor. Using serial sampling, dose gradients, and mathematical modeling, we generate genotype-fitness maps across therapeutic contexts and identify alterations that escape therapy. Our data expose varying dose-fitness relationship across genotypes, ranging from complete dose invariance to paradoxical dose dependency where fitness increases in higher doses. We predict fitness with combination therapy and compare these estimates to genome-wide fitness maps of drug combinations, identifying genotypes where combination therapy results in unexpected inferior effectiveness. These data are applied to nominate combination optimization strategies to forestall resistant disease.

Abstract: Summary
Interphase chromatin is hierarchically organized into higher-order architectures that are essential for gene functions, yet the biomolecules that regulate these 3D architectures remain poorly understood. Here, we show that scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB), a nuclear matrix (NM)-associated protein with RNA-binding functions, modulates chromatin condensation and stabilizes heterochromatin foci in mouse cells. SAFB interacts via its R/G-rich region with heterochromatin-associated repeat transcripts such as major satellite RNAs, which promote the phase separation driven by SAFB. Depletion of SAFB leads to changes in 3D genome organization, including an increase in interchromosomal interactions adjacent to pericentromeric heterochromatin and a decrease in genomic compartmentalization, which could result from the decondensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Collectively, we reveal the integrated roles of NM-associated proteins and repeat RNAs in the 3D organization of heterochromatin, which may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of nuclear architecture organization.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV latent reservoir forms the major hurdle to an HIV cure. The discovery of CD32 as marker of this reservoir has aroused much interest, but subsequent reports have challenged this finding. Here, we observe a positive correlation between the percentages of CD32+ cells among CD4+ T cells of aviremic cART-treated, HIV-infected individuals and their HIV DNA loads in peripheral blood. Moreover, optimization of the CD32+CD4+ T cell purification protocol reveals prominent enrichment for HIV DNA (mean, 292-fold) in these cells. However, no enrichment for HIV RNA is observed in CD32+CD4+ cells, yielding significantly reduced HIV RNA/DNA ratios. Furthermore, HIV proviruses in CD32+CD4+ cells can be reactivated ex vivo to produce virus, strongly suggesting that these cells support HIV transcriptional latency. Our results underscore the importance of isolating pure, bona fide CD32+CD4+ T cells for future studies and indicate that CD32 remains a promising candidate marker of the HIV reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to environmental changes by toggling metabolic pathways, preparing for homeostasis, and anticipating future stresses. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, carbon stress-induced gluconeogenesis is terminated upon glucose availability, a process that involves the multiprotein E3 ligase GIDSR4 recruiting N termini and catalyzing ubiquitylation of gluconeogenic enzymes. Here, genetics, biochemistry, and cryoelectron microscopy define molecular underpinnings of glucose-induced degradation. Unexpectedly, carbon stress induces an inactive anticipatory complex (GIDAnt), which awaits a glucose-induced substrate receptor to form the active GIDSR4. Meanwhile, other environmental perturbations elicit production of an alternative substrate receptor assembling into a related E3 ligase complex. The intricate structure of GIDAnt enables anticipating and ultimately binding various N-degron-targeting (i.e., “N-end rule”) substrate receptors, while the GIDSR4 E3 forms a clamp-like structure juxtaposing substrate lysines with the ubiquitylation active site. The data reveal evolutionarily conserved GID complexes as a family of multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligases responsive to extracellular stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA ATPase katanin severs microtubules. It is critical in cell division, centriole biogenesis, and neuronal morphogenesis. Its mutation causes microcephaly. The microtubule templates katanin hexamerization and activates its ATPase. The structural basis for these activities and how they lead to severing is unknown. Here, we show that β-tubulin tails are necessary and sufficient for severing. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal the essential tubulin tail glutamates gripped by a double spiral of electropositive loops lining the katanin central pore. Each spiral couples allosterically to the ATPase and binds alternating, successive substrate residues, with consecutive residues coordinated by adjacent protomers. This tightly couples tail binding, hexamerization, and ATPase activation. Hexamer structures in different states suggest an ATPase-driven, ratchet-like translocation of the tubulin tail through the pore. A disordered region outside the AAA core anchors katanin to the microtubule while the AAA motor exerts the forces that extract tubulin dimers and sever the microtubule.

Abstract: Summary
The family of bacterial SidE enzymes catalyzes non-canonical phosphoribosyl-linked (PR) serine ubiquitination and promotes infectivity of Legionella pneumophila. Here, we describe identification of two bacterial effectors that reverse PR ubiquitination and are thus named deubiquitinases for PR ubiquitination (DUPs; DupA and DupB). Structural analyses revealed that DupA and SidE ubiquitin ligases harbor a highly homologous catalytic phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain. However, unlike SidE ubiquitin ligases, DupA displays increased affinity to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, which allows DupA to cleave PR ubiquitin from substrates. Interfering with DupA-ubiquitin binding switches its activity toward SidE-type ligase. Given the high affinity of DupA to PR-ubiquitinated substrates, we exploited a catalytically inactive DupA mutant to trap and identify more than 180 PR-ubiquitinated host proteins in Legionella-infected cells. Proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fragmentation and membrane recruitment to Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCV) emerged as major SidE targets. The global map of PR-ubiquitinated substrates provides critical insights into host-pathogen interactions during Legionella infection.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling controls proliferation of multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells (MPCs) and their segregation into bipotent progenitors (BPs) and unipotent pro-acinar cells (PACs). Here, we showed that fast ultradian oscillations of the ligand Dll1 and the transcriptional effector Hes1 were crucial for MPC expansion, and changes in Hes1 oscillation parameters were associated with selective adoption of BP or PAC fate. Conversely, Jag1, a uniformly expressed ligand, restrained MPC growth. However, when its expression later segregated to PACs, Jag1 became critical for the specification of all but the most proximal BPs, and BPs were entirely lost in Jag1; Dll1 double mutants. Anatomically, ductal morphogenesis and organ architecture are minimally perturbed in Jag1 mutants until later stages, when ductal remodeling fails, and signs of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia appear. Our study thus uncovers that oscillating Notch activity in the developing pancreas, modulated by Jag1, is required to coordinate MPC growth and fate.

Abstract: The study of the liver microenvironment and hepatocyte’s response to this environment in the setting of healthy liver, cirrhotic liver or cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) addresses key questions for the development of novel liver therapies and predicts relevance of ex vivo PHHs models in liver biology. This study compared quantitative gene and protein expression of the inflammatory profile, oxidative stress response, angiogenesis and homing mechanisms in the biopsies of healthy and cirrhotic human livers and isolated PHHs. These profiles were correlated with the metabolic health of liver and PHHs defined by albumin production. The analysis demonstrated that cirrhotic liver and PHHs exhibited a distinct upregulation of the pro-inflammatory, oxidative stress and homing mechanism markers when compared to normal liver. The upregulation of the oxidative stress markers in PHHs inversely correlated with the albumin production. PHHs had diverse secretion of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, reflective of the cellular response to non-physiological culture conditions. The current study suggests that ex vivo PHHs manifest adaptive behavior by upregulating stress mechanisms (similar to the cirrhotic liver), downregulating normal metabolic function and upregulating matrix turnover. The ex vivo profile of PHHs may limit their therapeutic functionality and metabolic capacity to serve as in vitro metabolism and toxicology models.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we investigate the origin and nature of blastema cells that regenerate the adult murine digit tip. We show that Pdgfra-expressing mesenchymal cells in uninjured digits establish the regenerative blastema and are essential for regeneration. Single-cell profiling shows that the mesenchymal blastema cells are distinct from both uninjured digit and embryonic limb or digit Pdgfra-positive cells. This unique blastema state is environmentally determined; dermal fibroblasts transplanted into the regenerative, but not non-regenerative, digit express blastema-state genes and contribute to bone regeneration. Moreover, lineage tracing with single-cell profiling indicates that endogenous osteoblasts or osteocytes acquire a blastema mesenchymal transcriptional state and contribute to both dermis and bone regeneration. Thus, mammalian digit tip regeneration occurs via a distinct adult mechanism where the regenerative environment promotes acquisition of a blastema state that enables cells from tissues such as bone to contribute to the regeneration of other mesenchymal tissues such as the dermis.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between two-dimensional cell cultures and complex in vivo tissues, three-dimensional cell culture models are of increasing interest in the fields of cell biology and pharmacology. However, present challenges hamper live cell imaging of three-dimensional cell cultures. These include (i) the stabilization of these structures under perfusion conditions, (ii) the recording of many z-planes at high spatio-temporal resolution, (iii) and the data analysis that ranges in complexity from whole specimens to single cells. Here, we addressed these issues for the time-lapse analysis of Ca2+ signaling in spheroids composed of human tongue-derived HTC-8 cells upon perfusion of gustatory substances. Live cell imaging setups for confocal and light sheet microscopy were developed that allow simple and robust spheroid stabilization and high-resolution microscopy with perfusion. Visualization of spheroids made of HTC-8 cells expressing the G-GECO fluorescent Ca2+ sensor revealed Ca2+ transients that showed similar kinetics but different amplitudes upon perfusion of bitter compounds Salicine and Saccharin. Dose-dependent responses to Saccharin required extracellular Ca2+. From the border towards the center of spheroids, compound-induced Ca2+ signals were progressively delayed and decreased in amplitude. Stimulation with ATP led to strong Ca2+ transients that were faster than those evoked by the bitter compounds and blockade of purinergic receptors with Suramin abutted the response to Saccharin, suggesting that ATP mediates a positive autocrine and paracrine feedback. Imaging of ATP-induced Ca2+ transients with light sheet microscopy allowed acquisition over a z-depth of 100 μm without losing spatial and temporal resolution. In summary, the presented approaches permit the study of fast cellular signaling in three-dimensional cultures upon compound perfusion.

Abstract: Summary
Non-cortical visual areas in vertebrate brains extract relevant stimulus features, such as motion, object size, and location, to support diverse behavioral tasks. The optic tectum and pretectum, two primary visual areas in zebrafish, are involved in motion processing, and yet their differential neural representation of behaviorally relevant visual features is unclear. Here, we characterize receptive fields (RFs) of motion-sensitive neurons in the diencephalon and midbrain. We show that RFs of many pretectal neurons are large and sample the lower visual field, whereas RFs of tectal neurons are mostly small-size selective and sample the upper nasal visual field more densely. Furthermore, optomotor swimming can reliably be evoked by presenting forward motion in the lower temporal visual field alone, matching the lower visual field bias of the pretectum. Thus, tectum and pretectum extract different visual features from distinct regions of visual space, which is likely a result of their adaptations to hunting and optomotor behavior, respectively.

Abstract: Sclerodistomoides pacificus is the only species described now in Sclerodistomoididae. We present in this paper the first ultrastructural data of the mature spermatozoon of a species from the genus Sclerodistomoides. Adult specimens of S. pacificus (Digenea: Hemiuroidea: Sclerodistomoididae), were parasites of the gall-bladder of the teleost fish Cheilopogon pinnatibarbatus captured in the Atlantic Ocean, near Dakar (Senegal). The male gamete is a filiform cell which exhibits a similar ultrastructural organization to that reported in most species belonging to the Hemiuroidea with two axonemes of the 9 + ‘1′ pattern of trepaxonematans, a nucleus, a mitochondrion, external ornamentation of the plasma membrane not associated with cortical microtubules and located in the anterior region of the spermatozoon, and parallel cortical microtubules disposed in one side of the spermatozoon. However, the present study allowed describing for the first time a moniliform mitochondrion in the Hemiuroidea. The presence of a moniliform mitochondrion and the absence of filamentous external ornamentation described in other Hemiuridae: Lecithochirium microstomum, L. musculus and Hemiurus appendiculatus are a good tool for phylogenetic purposes in the Hemiuroidea. Moreover, spermatological organisation and model are discussed in context with those of previous studies in the Hemiuroidea.

Abstract: Summary
The signal recognition particle (SRP), responsible for co-translational protein targeting and delivery to cellular membranes, depends on the native long-hairpin fold of its RNA to confer functionality. Since RNA initiates folding during its synthesis, we used high-resolution optical tweezers to follow in real time the co-transcriptional folding of SRP RNA. Surprisingly, SRP RNA folding is robust to transcription rate changes and the presence or absence of its 5′-precursor sequence. The folding pathway also reveals the obligatory attainment of a non-native hairpin intermediate (H1) that eventually rearranges into the native fold. Furthermore, H1 provides a structural platform alternative to the native fold for RNase P to bind and mature SRP RNA co-transcriptionally. Delays in attaining the final native fold are detrimental to the cell, altogether showing that a co-transcriptional folding pathway underpins the proper biogenesis of function-essential SRP RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin D (VD) is a known differentiating agent, but the role of VD receptor (VDR) is still incompletely described in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whose treatment is based mostly on antimitotic chemotherapy. Here, we present an unexpected role of VDR in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis. Limited VDR expression is associated with impaired myeloid progenitor differentiation and is a new prognostic factor in AML. In mice, the lack of Vdr results in increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, malignant transformation of Vdr−/− cells results in myeloid differentiation block and increases self-renewal. Vdr promoter is methylated in AML as in CD34+ cells, and demethylating agents induce VDR expression. Association of VDR agonists with hypomethylating agents promotes leukemia stem cell exhaustion and decreases tumor burden in AML mouse models. Thus, Vdr functions as a regulator of stem cell homeostasis and leukemic propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance is a major factor in obesity-linked type 2 diabetes. PPARγ is a master regulator of adipogenesis, and small molecule agonists, termed thiazolidinediones, are potent therapeutic insulin sensitizers. Here, we studied the role of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) as a transcriptional co-repressor of PPARγ. We found that adipocyte-specific TAZ knockout (TAZ AKO) mice demonstrate a constitutively active PPARγ state. Obese TAZ AKO mice show improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to littermate controls. PPARγ response genes are upregulated in adipose tissue from TAZ AKO mice and adipose tissue inflammation was also decreased. In vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies revealed that the TAZ-PPARγ interaction is partially dependent on ERK-mediated Ser112 PPARγ phosphorylation. As adipocyte PPARγ Ser112 phosphorylation is increased in obesity, repression of PPARγ activity by TAZ could contribute to insulin resistance. These results identify TAZ as a new factor in the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of p53 function contributes to the development of many cancers. While cell-autonomous consequences of p53 mutation have been studied extensively, the role of p53 in regulating the anti-tumor immune response is still poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of p53 in cancer cells modulates the tumor-immune landscape to circumvent immune destruction. Deletion of p53 promotes the recruitment and instruction of suppressive myeloid CD11b+ cells, in part through increased expression of CXCR3/CCR2-associated chemokines and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and attenuates the CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. p53-null tumors also show an accumulation of suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Finally, we show that two key drivers of tumorigenesis, activation of KRAS and deletion of p53, cooperate to promote immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown whether the incremental increases in BCL6 amounts in antigen-activated B cells influence the unfolding differentiation before germinal center (GC) formation. By comparing shortly after immunization the distribution of conventional B cells to those enforced to express BCL6 at the upper quartile of normal and those lacking BCL6 altogether, we determined that B cell representation in the stages before the GC compartment was related to BCL6 amounts. This was not by increased proliferation or suppression of early plasmablast differentiation, but rather by preferential recruitment and progression through these early stages of B cell activation, culminating in preferential transition into GC. Once established, this bias was stable in GC over several weeks; other BCL6-regulated GC B cell behaviors were unaffected. We propose that setting BCL6 amounts very early in activated B cells will be central in determining clonal representation in the GC and thus memory populations.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the genome and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) have been implicated in multiple gene regulatory processes, but the underlying logic of these interactions remains poorly defined. Here, we report high-resolution chromatin binding maps of two core components of the NPC, Nup107 and Nup93, in Drosophila cells. Our investigation uncovered differential binding of these NPC subunits, where Nup107 preferentially targets active genes while Nup93 associates primarily with Polycomb-silenced regions. Comparison to Lamin-associated domains (LADs) revealed that NPC binding sites can be found within LADs, demonstrating a linear binding of the genome along the nuclear envelope. Importantly, we identified a functional role of Nup93 in silencing of Polycomb target genes and in spatial folding of Polycomb domains. Our findings lend to a model where different nuclear pores bind different types of chromatin via interactions with specific NPC sub-complexes, and a subset of Polycomb domains is stabilized by interactions with Nup93.

Abstract: Summary
The recovery of stalled replication forks depends on the controlled resection of nascent DNA and on the loading of cohesin. These processes operate in the context of nascent chromatin, but the impact of nucleosome structure on a fork restart remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex acts together with the chromatin modifiers Gcn5 and Set1 and the histone remodelers RSC, Chd1, and Isw1 to promote chromatin remodeling at stalled forks. Increased chromatin accessibility facilitates the resection of nascent DNA by the Exo1 nuclease and the Sgs1 and Chl1 DNA helicases. Importantly, increased ssDNA promotes the recruitment of cohesin to arrested forks in a Scc2-Scc4-dependent manner. Altogether, these results indicate that MRX cooperates with chromatin modifiers to orchestrate the action of remodelers, nucleases, and DNA helicases, promoting the resection of nascent DNA and the loading of cohesin, two key processes involved in the recovery of arrested forks.

Abstract: Summary
Living systems integrate biochemical reactions that determine the functional state of each cell. Reactions are primarily mediated by proteins. In proteomic studies, these have been treated as independent entities, disregarding their higher-level organization into complexes that affects their activity and/or function and is thus of great interest for biological research. Here, we describe the implementation of an integrated technique to quantify cell-state-specific changes in the physical arrangement of protein complexes concurrently for thousands of proteins and hundreds of complexes. Applying this technique to a comparison of human cells in interphase and mitosis, we provide a systematic overview of mitotic proteome reorganization. The results recall key hallmarks of mitotic complex remodeling and suggest a model of nuclear pore complex disassembly, which we validate by orthogonal methods. To support the interpretation of quantitative SEC-SWATH-MS datasets, we extend the software CCprofiler and provide an interactive exploration tool, SECexplorer-cc.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a frequent form of DNA lesion and are strongly inhibitive in diverse DNA transactions. Despite recent developments, the biochemical detection of DPCs remains a limiting factor for the in-depth mechanistic understanding of DPC repair. Here, we develop a sensitive and versatile assay, designated ARK, for the quantitative analysis of DPCs in cells. ARK uses sequential chaotropic and detergent-based isolation of DPCs and substantially enhances sample purity, resulting in a 5-fold increase in detection sensitivity and a 10-fold reduction in background reading. We validate the ARK assay with genetic mutants with established deficiencies in DPC repair and demonstrate its robustness by using common DPC-inducing reagents, including formaldehyde, camptothecin, and etoposide. In addition, we show that the Fanconi anemia pathway contributes to the repair of DPCs. Thus, ARK is expected to facilitate various studies aimed at understanding both fundamental biology and translational applications of DNA-protein crosslink repair.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial proteome is built mainly by import of nuclear-encoded precursors, which are targeted mostly by cleavable presequences. Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside mitochondria that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to mitochondria. Rox1 binds mtDNA and performs a TFAM-like function pivotal for transcription and translation. Induction of early mtUPR provides a reversible stress model to mechanistically dissect the initial steps in mtUPR pathways with the stressTFAM Rox1 as the first line of defense.

Abstract: Summary
A comprehensive catalog of cancer driver mutations is essential for understanding tumorigenesis and developing therapies. Exome-sequencing studies have mapped many protein-coding drivers, yet few non-coding drivers are known because genome-wide discovery is challenging. We developed a driver discovery method, ActiveDriverWGS, and analyzed 120,788 cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 1,844 whole tumor genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. We found 30 CRMs with enriched SNVs and indels (FDR < 0.05). These frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) were ubiquitously active in human tissues, showed long-range chromatin interactions and mRNA abundance associations with target genes, and were enriched in motif-rewiring mutations and structural variants. Genomic deletion of one FMRE in human cells caused proliferative deficiencies and transcriptional deregulation of cancer genes CCNB1IP1, CDH1, and CDKN2B, validating observations in FMRE-mutated tumors. Pathway analysis revealed further sub-significant FMREs at cancer genes and processes, indicating an unexplored landscape of infrequent driver mutations in the non-coding genome.

Abstract: Summary
The inter-differentiation between cell states promotes cancer cell survival under stress and fosters non-genetic heterogeneity (NGH). NGH is, therefore, a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is confounded by genetic heterogeneity. Here we show that NGH in serous ovarian cancer (SOC) can be accurately measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) cells, the cells of origin of SOC. Surveying the transcriptomes of ∼6,000 FTE cells, predominantly from non-ovarian cancer patients, identified 6 FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of ∼1,700 tumors robustly correlated with survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic stratification of SOC.

Abstract: The Liver is constantly subjected to mechanical, chemical and pathological insults throughout life, as a result of which there is a common occurrence of various liver diseases. Due to the complex nature of liver architecture, it is not possible to mimic the in-vivo conditions beyond a certain limit. Hence, the development of in-vitro and ex-vivo models to study various liver diseases has gained more importance over the last few decades. The present study aims to develop a semi-perfused liver explant model to give an extended lifetime for studying liver pathology and treatment options. Caprine liver tissue explants were sliced, weighed (25 mg) and placed on the area vasculosa of fertilized chicken eggs. Unfertilized eggs were used as controls. After varying time intervals of incubation on area vasculosa of fertilized chicken eggs, the liver slices were subjected to cell viability assay, lactate dehydrogenase assay and Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase assays. The results indicate that the viability and functional properties of such semi-perfused liver tissue explants holds good up to 6 h. Finally, the liver tissue explants were pre-treated with FBS, with and without anti-fibrotic drugs, and placed on chick embryo area vasculosa up to 6 h. The anti-fibrotic drug-treated semi perfused liver tissue explant showed a decrease in collagen formation as confirmed by histology and western blot. We deem that the use of extra-embryonic vasculature of chicken bed for extending the life of tissue explants will serve as a cost-effective alternative to animal models to understand disease mechanisms under drug treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Altered neural dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus may contribute to cognitive impairments in the complex chromosomal disorder Down syndrome (DS). Here, we demonstrate non-overlapping behavioral differences associated with distinct abnormalities in hippocampal and mPFC electrophysiology during a canonical spatial working memory task in three partially trisomic mouse models of DS (Dp1Tyb, Dp10Yey, and Dp17Yey) that together cover all regions of homology with human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Dp1Tyb mice show slower decision-making (unrelated to the gene dose of DYRK1A, which has been implicated in DS cognitive dysfunction) and altered theta dynamics (reduced frequency, increased hippocampal-mPFC coherence, and increased modulation of hippocampal high gamma); Dp10Yey mice show impaired alternation performance and reduced theta modulation of hippocampal low gamma; and Dp17Yey mice are not significantly different from the wild type. These results link specific hippocampal and mPFC circuit dysfunctions to cognitive deficits in DS models and, importantly, map them to discrete regions of Hsa21.

Abstract: Background
We have been trying to produce scaffold-free structures for airway regeneration using a bio-3D-printer with spheroids, to avoid scaffold-associated risks such as infection. Previous studies have shown that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) play an important role in such structures, but HUVECs cannot be isolated from adult humans. The aim of this study was to identify alternatives to HUVECs for use in scaffold-free structures.
Methods
Three types of structure were compared, made of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells with HUVECs, human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls), and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial cells.
Results
No significant difference in tensile strength was observed between the three groups. Histologically, some small capillary-like tube formations comprising CD31-positive cells were observed in all groups. The number and diameters of such formations were significantly lower in the iPSC-derived endothelial cell group than in other groups. Glycosaminoglycan content was significantly lower in the iPSC-derived endothelial cell group than in the HUVEC group, while no significant difference was observed between the HUVEC and HMVEC-L groups.
Conclusions
HMVEC-Ls can replace HUVECs as a cell source for scaffold-free trachea-like structures. However, some limitations were associated with iPSC-derived endothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is highly metabolically active tissue that dissipates energy via UCP1 as heat, and BAT mass is correlated negatively with obesity. The presence of BAT/BAT-like tissue in humans renders BAT as an attractive target against obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we identify Aifm2, a NADH oxidoreductase domain containing flavoprotein, as a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein highly enriched in BAT. Aifm2 is induced by cold as well as by diet. Upon cold or β-adrenergic stimulation, Aifm2 associates with the outer side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a unique BAT-specific first mammalian NDE (external NADH dehydrogenase)-like enzyme, Aifm2 oxidizes NADH to maintain high cytosolic NAD levels in supporting robust glycolysis and to transfer electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) for fueling thermogenesis. Aifm2 in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) promotes oxygen consumption, uncoupled respiration, and heat production during cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. Aifm2, thus, can ameliorate diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The vagus nerve conveys gastrointestinal cues to the brain to control eating behavior. In obesity, vagally mediated gut-brain signaling is disrupted. Here, we show that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide synthesized proportional to the food consumed in vagal afferent neurons (VANs) of chow-fed rats. CART injection into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), the site of vagal afferent central termination, reduces food intake. Conversely, blocking endogenous CART action in the NTS increases food intake in chow-fed rats, and this requires intact VANs. Viral-mediated Cartpt knockdown in VANs increases weight gain and daily food intake via larger meals and faster ingestion rate. In obese rats fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet, meal-induced CART synthesis in VANs is blunted and CART antibody fails to increase food intake. However, CART injection into the NTS retains its anorexigenic effect in obese rats. Restoring disrupted VAN CART signaling in obesity could be a promising therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Summary
Spatially and functionally distinct domains of heterochromatin and euchromatin play important roles in the maintenance of chromosome stability and regulation of gene expression, but a comprehensive knowledge of their composition is lacking. Here, we develop a strategy for the isolation of native Schizosaccharomyces pombe heterochromatin and euchromatin fragments and analyze their composition by using quantitative mass spectrometry. The shared and euchromatin-specific proteomes contain proteins involved in DNA and chromatin metabolism and in transcription, respectively. The heterochromatin-specific proteome includes all proteins with known roles in heterochromatin formation and, in addition, is enriched for subsets of nucleoporins and inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, which associate with different chromatin domains. While the INM proteins are required for the integrity of the nucleolus, containing ribosomal DNA repeats, the nucleoporins are required for aggregation of heterochromatic foci and epigenetic inheritance. The results provide a comprehensive picture of heterochromatin-associated proteins and suggest a role for specific nucleoporins in heterochromatin function.

Abstract: Summary
Acute treatment with replication-stalling chemotherapeutics causes reversal of replication forks. BRCA proteins protect reversed forks from nucleolytic degradation, and their loss leads to chemosensitivity. Here, we show that fork degradation is no longer detectable in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells exposed to multiple cisplatin doses, mimicking a clinical treatment regimen. This effect depends on increased expression and chromatin loading of PRIMPOL and is regulated by ATR activity. Electron microscopy and single-molecule DNA fiber analyses reveal that PRIMPOL rescues fork degradation by reinitiating DNA synthesis past DNA lesions. PRIMPOL repriming leads to accumulation of ssDNA gaps while suppressing fork reversal. We propose that cells adapt to repeated cisplatin doses by activating PRIMPOL repriming under conditions that would otherwise promote pathological reversed fork degradation. This effect is generalizable to other conditions of impaired fork reversal (e.g., SMARCAL1 loss or PARP inhibition) and suggests a new strategy to modulate cisplatin chemosensitivity by targeting the PRIMPOL pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria are continually challenged by foreign invaders, including bacteriophages, and have evolved a variety of defenses against these invaders. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway uses eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic triadenylate (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage λ through an abortive infection mechanism. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection and negative regulation by a Trip13 ATPase.

Abstract: Summary
Low-complexity protein domains promote the formation of various biomolecular condensates. However, in many cases, the precise sequence features governing condensate formation and identity remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of intrinsically disordered mixed-charge domains (MCDs) in nuclear speckle condensation. Proteins composed exclusively of arginine-aspartic acid dipeptide repeats undergo length-dependent condensation and speckle incorporation. Substituting arginine with lysine in synthetic and natural speckle-associated MCDs abolishes these activities, identifying a key role for multivalent contacts through arginine’s guanidinium ion. MCDs can synergize with a speckle-associated RNA recognition motif to promote speckle specificity and residence. MCD behavior is tunable through net-charge: increasing negative charge abolishes condensation and speckle incorporation. Contrastingly, increasing positive charge through arginine leads to enhanced condensation, speckle enlargement, decreased splicing factor mobility, and defective mRNA export. Together, these results identify key sequence determinants of MCD-promoted speckle condensation and link the dynamic material properties of speckles with function in mRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how splicing events are coordinated across numerous introns in metazoan RNA transcripts requires quantitative analyses of transient RNA processing events in living cells. We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively. Thus, nano-COP unveils the organizational complexity of RNA processing.

Abstract: Ryanodine receptor ion channels (RyR1s) release Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to regulate skeletal muscle contraction. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified the heterozygous RYR1 variant c.14767_14772del resulting in the in-frame deletion p.(Phe4923_Phe4924del) in two brothers with a lethal form of the fetal akinesia deformation syndrome (FADS). The two deleted phenylalanines (RyR1-Δ4923FF4924) are located in the S6 pore-lining helix of RyR1. Clinical features in one of the two siblings included severe hypotonia, thin ribs, swallowing inability, and respiratory insufficiency that caused early death. Functional consequences of the RyR1-Δ4923FF4924 variant were determined using recombinant 2,200-kDa homotetrameric and heterotetrameric RyR1 channel complexes that were expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized by cellular, electrophysiological, and computational methods. Cellular Ca2+ release in response to caffeine indicated that the homotetrameric variant formed caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ conducting channels in HEK293 cells. In contrast, the homotetrameric channel complex was not activated by Ca2+ and did not conduct Ca2+ based on single-channel measurements. The computational analysis suggested decreased protein stability and loss of salt bridge interactions between RyR1-R4944 and RyR1-D4938, increasing the electrostatic interaction energy of Ca2+ in a region 20 Å from the mutant site. Co-expression of wild-type and mutant RyR1s resulted in Ca2+-dependent channel activities that displayed intermediate Ca2+ conductances and suggested maintenance of a reduced Ca2+ release in the two patients. Our findings reveal that the RYR1 pore variant p.(Phe4923_Phe4924del) attenuates the flow of Ca2+ through heterotetrameric channels, but alone was not sufficient to cause FADS, indicating additional genetic factors to be involved.

Abstract: Summary
Exposure to natural metabolites contributes to the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs). Through metabolome profiling, we identify the inverse correlation between serum concentrations of 4-cresol and type 2 diabetes. The chronic administration of non-toxic doses of 4-cresol in complementary preclinical models of CMD reduces adiposity, glucose intolerance, and liver triglycerides, enhances insulin secretion in vivo, stimulates islet density and size, and pancreatic β-cell proliferation, and increases vascularization, suggesting activated islet enlargement. In vivo insulin sensitivity is not affected by 4-cresol. The incubation of mouse isolated islets with 4-cresol results in enhanced insulin secretion, insulin content, and β-cell proliferation of a magnitude similar to that induced by GLP-1. In both CMD models and isolated islets, 4-cresol is associated with the downregulated expression of the kinase DYRK1A, which may mediate its biological effects. Our findings identify 4-cresol as an effective regulator of β-cell function, which opens up perspectives for therapeutic applications in syndromes of insulin deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) are currently under evaluation for use in cancer vaccines. Although both DC subsets can activate adaptive and innate lymphocytes, their capacity to recruit such cells is rarely considered. Here, we show that pDCs and cDC2s display a striking difference in chemokine secretion, which correlates with the recruitment of distinct types of immune effector cells. Activated pDCs express high levels of CXCR3 ligands and attract more CD8+ T cells, CD56+ T cells, and γδ T cells in vitro, compared to cDC2s. Skin from melanoma patients shows an influx of immune effector cells following intradermal vaccination with pDCs or cDC2s, with pDCs inducing the strongest influx of lymphocytes known to possess cytolytic activity. These findings suggest that combining both DC subsets could unite the preferred chemoattractive properties of pDCs with the superior T cell priming properties of cDC2s to ultimately enhance vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: The failure of regeneration of damaged liver in various end-stage liver diseases results in high morbidity and mortality. In this context, we have demonstrated the differentiation ability of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into hepatocytes. In this study, HSCs were isolated from a donor and cultured which exhibited the presence of CD34 and CD133 and absence of CD90 and CD73 markers. These CD34+ HSCs were induced for 21 days in hepatocyte differentiation medium (HDM). The obtained cells were characterized by immunocytochemical, immunofluorescence, western blot, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis. Further, functional assays were done to accentuate the differentiated cells are hepatocytes. In HDM at day 6 differentiated cells showed the expression of definitive endodermal (DE) markers, SOX17, GATA4 and FoxA2 indicating the beginning of differentiation process. At day 21 the flow cytometry analysis showed 84.2 % positive to ALB-PE, 75.4 % positive to HNF4α-PE, and 77.3% positive to AFP-PE. Further, the qRT-PCR and western blot analysis presented prominent expression of hepatocyte-specific genes AAT, ALB, AFP, CK18, CK19, HNF4α, TFR2, and Hepcidin confirms the generation of hepatocytes in HDM. The ability of albumin secretion, urea production, glycogen storage, uptake of LDL, high ALDH enzyme activity describes the functionality of differentiated hepatocytes. Distinct expression of UGT1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP7A1 genes explains the ability to clear toxins and bilirubin as observed in normal hepatocytes. All these results indicate HSCs were differentiated into hepatocytes thus, autologous transplantation of HSCs could be a better option in the regeneration of the damaged liver.

Abstract: Summary
PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates multiple metabolic pathways and contributes to tumorigenesis in a poorly understood manner. We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1. Thus, the balance between PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of ME1 S336 and ACAT1-mediated acetylation of K337 strongly influences NADPH generation, lipid metabolism, and the susceptibility to colorectal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is essential for memory and navigation, but the neural codes underlying these functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the most prominent cell type in layers 2/3 (L2/3) of the mouse granular RSC is a hyperexcitable, small pyramidal cell. These cells have a low rheobase (LR), high input resistance, lack of spike frequency adaptation, and spike widths intermediate to those of neighboring fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons and regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons. LR cells are excitatory but rarely synapse onto neighboring neurons. Instead, L2/3 is a feedforward, not feedback, inhibition-dominated network with dense connectivity between FS cells and from FS to LR neurons. Biophysical models of LR but not RS cells precisely and continuously encode sustained input from afferent postsubicular head-direction cells. Thus, the distinct intrinsic properties of LR neurons can support both the precision and persistence necessary to encode information over multiple timescales in the RSC.

Abstract: Summary
Structural and biochemical studies have revealed the basic principles of how the replisome duplicates genomic DNA, but little is known about its dynamics during DNA replication. We reconstitute the 34 proteins needed to form the S. cerevisiae replisome and show how changing local concentrations of the key DNA polymerases tunes the ability of the complex to efficiently recycle these proteins or to dynamically exchange them. Particularly, we demonstrate redundancy of the Pol α-primase DNA polymerase activity in replication and show that Pol α-primase and the lagging-strand Pol δ can be re-used within the replisome to support the synthesis of large numbers of Okazaki fragments. This unexpected malleability of the replisome might allow it to deal with barriers and resource challenges during replication of large genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) maintain transcriptional repression to preserve cellular identity in two distinct repressive complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, that modify histones by depositing H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3, respectively. PRC1 and PRC2 exist in different variants and show a complex regulatory cross-talk. However, the contribution that H2AK119ub1 plays in mediating PcG repressive functions remains largely controversial. Using a fully catalytic inactive RING1B mutant, we demonstrated that H2AK119ub1 deposition is essential to maintain PcG-target gene repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H2AK119ub1 induced a rapid displacement of PRC2 activity and a loss of H3K27me3 deposition. This preferentially affected PRC2.2 variant with respect to PRC2.1, destabilizing canonical PRC1 activity. Finally, we found that variant PRC1 forms can sense H2AK119ub1 deposition, which contributes to their stabilization specifically at sites where this modification is highly enriched. Overall, our data place H2AK119ub1 deposition as a central hub that mounts PcG repressive machineries to preserve cell transcriptional identity.

Abstract: Numerous lines of evidence indicate that nuclear calcium concentration ([Ca2+]n) may be controlled independently from cytosolic events by a local machinery. In particular, the perinuclear space between the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) of the nuclear envelope (NE) likely serves as an intracellular store for Ca2+ ions. Since ONM is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the perinuclear space is adjacent to the lumen of ER thus allowing a direct exchange of ions and factors between the two organelles. Moreover, INM and ONM are fused at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which provides the only direct passageway between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. However, due to the presence of ion channels, exchangers and transporters, it has been generally accepted that nuclear ion fluxes may occur across ONM and INM. Within the INM, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) isoform 1 seems to play an important role in handling Ca2+ through the different nuclear compartments. Particularly, nuclear NCX preferentially allows local Ca2+ flowing from nucleoplasm into NE lumen thanks to the Na+ gradient created by the juxtaposed Na+/K+-ATPase. Such transfer reduces abnormal elevation of [Ca2+]n within the nucleoplasm thus modulating specific transductional pathways and providing a protective mechanism against cell death. Despite very few studies on this issue, here we discuss those making major contribution to the field, also addressing the pathophysiological implication of nuclear NCX malfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicle pool properties are known determinants of synaptic efficacy, but their potential role as modifiable substrates in forms of Hebbian plasticity is still unclear. Here, we investigate this using a nanoscale readout of functionally recycled vesicles in natively wired hippocampal CA3→CA1 circuits undergoing long-term potentiation (LTP). We show that the total recycled vesicle pool is larger after plasticity induction, with the smallest terminals exhibiting the greatest relative expansion. Changes in the spatial organization of vesicles accompany potentiation including a specific increase in the number of recycled vesicles at the active zone, consistent with an ultrastructural remodeling component of synaptic strengthening. The cAMP-PKA pathway activator, forskolin, selectively mimics some features of LTP-driven changes, suggesting that distinct and independent modules of regulation accompany plasticity expression. Our findings provide evidence for a presynaptic locus of LTP encoded in the number and arrangement of functionally recycled vesicles, with relevance for models of long-term plasticity storage.

Abstract: Summary
Deubiquitylases (DUBs) regulate critical signaling pathways at the intersection of host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Although RIG-I activation is heavily dependent on ubiquitylation, systematic analyses of DUBs that regulate this pathway have not been performed. Using a ubiquitin C-terminal electrophile, we profile DUBs that function during influenza A virus (IAV) infection and isolate OTUB1 as a key regulator of RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Upon infection, OTUB1 relocalizes from the nucleus to mitochondrial membranes together with RIG-I, viral PB2, and NS1. Its expression depends on competing effects of interferon stimulation and IAV-triggered degradation. OTUB1 activates RIG-I via a dual mechanism of K48 polyubiquitin hydrolysis and formation of an E2-repressive complex with UBCH5c. We reconstitute this mechanism in a cell-free system comprising [35S]IRF3, purified RIG-I, mitochondrial membranes, and cytosol expressing OTUB1 variants. A range of IAV NS1 proteins trigger proteasomal degradation of OTUB1, antagonizing the RIG-I signaling cascade and antiviral responses.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian pre-mRNA 3′-end-processing machinery consists of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), and other proteins, but the overall architecture of this machinery remains unclear. CPSF contains two functionally distinct modules: a cleavage factor (mCF) and a polyadenylation specificity factor (mPSF). Here, we have produced recombinant human CPSF and CstF and examined these factors by electron microscopy (EM). We find that mPSF is the organizational core of the machinery, while the conformations of mCF and CstF and the position of mCF relative to mPSF are highly variable. We have identified by cryo-EM a segment in CPSF100 that tethers mCF to mPSF, and we have named it the PSF interaction motif (PIM). Mutations in the PIM can abolish CPSF formation, indicating that it is a crucial contact in CPSF. We have also obtained reconstructions of mCF and CstF77 by cryo-EM, assembled around the mPSF core.

Abstract: Summary
Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is overexpressed in various human cancers and linked to poor response to chemotherapy. Various PRMT1 inhibitors are currently under development; yet, we do not fully understand the mechanisms underpinning PRMT1 involvement in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified PRMT1 as regulator of arginine methylation in ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin. We showed that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) binds to and phosphorylates PRMT1 in response to cisplatin, inducing its chromatin recruitment and redirecting its enzymatic activity toward Arg3 of histone H4 (H4R3). On chromatin, the DNA-PK/PRMT1 axis induces senescence-associated secretory phenotype through H4R3me2a deposition at pro-inflammatory gene promoters. Finally, PRMT1 inhibition reduces the clonogenic growth of cancer cells exposed to low doses of cisplatin, sensitizing them to apoptosis. While unravelling the role of PRMT1 in response to genotoxic agents, our findings indicate the possibility of targeting PRMT1 to overcome chemoresistance in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Sporadic gliomas in companion dogs provide a window on the interaction between tumorigenic mechanisms and host environment. We compared the molecular profiles of canine gliomas with those of human pediatric and adult gliomas to characterize evolutionarily conserved mammalian mutational processes in gliomagenesis. Employing whole-genome, exome, transcriptome, and methylation sequencing of 83 canine gliomas, we found alterations shared between canine and human gliomas such as the receptor tyrosine kinases, TP53 and cell-cycle pathways, and IDH1 R132. Canine gliomas showed high similarity with human pediatric gliomas per robust aneuploidy, mutational rates, relative timing of mutations, and DNA-methylation patterns. Our cross-species comparative genomic analysis provides unique insights into glioma etiology and the chronology of glioma-causing somatic alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets for major diseases. Here, we present structures of peptide and Gs-bound pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, PAC1 receptor, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), (CRF1) receptor. Together with recently solved structures, these provide coverage of the major class B GPCR subfamilies. Diverse orientations of the extracellular domain to the receptor core in different receptors are at least partially dependent on evolutionary conservation in the structure and nature of peptide interactions. Differences in peptide interactions to the receptor core also influence the interlinked TM2-TM1-TM6/ECL3/TM7 domain, and this is likely important in their diverse signaling. However, common conformational reorganization of ECL2, linked to reorganization of ICL2, modulates G protein contacts. Comparison between receptors reveals ICL2 as a key domain forming dynamic G protein interactions in a receptor- and ligand-specific manner. This work advances our understanding of class B GPCR activation and Gs coupling.

Abstract: Summary
Many traits are complex, depending non-additively on variant combinations. Even in model systems, such as the yeast S. cerevisiae, carrying out the high-order variant-combination testing needed to dissect complex traits remains a daunting challenge. Here, we describe “X-gene” genetic analysis (XGA), a strategy for engineering and profiling highly combinatorial gene perturbations. We demonstrate XGA on yeast ABC transporters by engineering 5,353 strains, each deleted for a random subset of 16 transporters, and profiling each strain’s resistance to 16 compounds. XGA yielded 85,648 genotype-to-resistance observations, revealing high-order genetic interactions for 13 of the 16 transporters studied. Neural networks yielded intuitive functional models and guided exploration of fluconazole resistance, which was influenced non-additively by five genes. Together, our results showed that highly combinatorial genetic perturbation can functionally dissect complex traits, supporting pursuit of analogous strategies in human cells and other model systems.

Abstract: Lysosomotropic agents have been used to permeabilize lysosomes and thereby implicate these organelles in diverse cellular processes. Since lysosomes are Ca2+ stores, this rupturing action, particularly that induced by GPN, has also been used to rapidly release Ca2+ from lysosomes. However, a recent study has questioned the mechanism of action of GPN and concluded that, acutely, it does not permeabilize lysosomes but releases Ca2+ directly from the ER instead. We therefore appraise these provocative findings in the context of the existing literature. We suggest that further work is required to unequivocally rule out lysosomes as contributors to GPN-evoked Ca2+ signals.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the methyl-DNA-binding repressor protein MeCP2 cause the devastating neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome. It has been challenging to understand how MeCP2 regulates transcription because MeCP2 binds broadly across the genome and MeCP2 mutations are associated with widespread small-magnitude changes in neuronal gene expression. We demonstrate here that MeCP2 represses nascent RNA transcription of highly methylated long genes in the brain through its interaction with the NCoR co-repressor complex. By measuring the rates of transcriptional initiation and elongation directly in the brain, we find that MeCP2 has no measurable effect on transcriptional elongation, but instead represses the rate at which Pol II initiates transcription of highly methylated long genes. These findings suggest a new model of MeCP2 function in which MeCP2 binds broadly across highly methylated regions of DNA, but acts at transcription start sites to attenuate transcriptional initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Since nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitosis in metazoan cells, it has been proposed that macroautophagy must be inhibited to maintain genome integrity. However, repression of macroautophagy during mitosis remains controversial and mechanistic detail limited to the suggestion that CDK1 phosphorylates VPS34. Here, we show that initiation of macroautophagy, measured by the translocation of the ULK complex to autophagic puncta, is repressed during mitosis, even when mTORC1 is inhibited. Indeed, mTORC1 is inactive during mitosis, reflecting its failure to localize to lysosomes due to CDK1-dependent RAPTOR phosphorylation. While mTORC1 normally represses autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1, ATG13, ATG14, and TFEB, we show that the mitotic phosphorylation of these autophagy regulators, including at known repressive sites, is dependent on CDK1 but independent of mTOR. Thus, CDK1 substitutes for inhibited mTORC1 as the master regulator of macroautophagy during mitosis, uncoupling autophagy regulation from nutrient status to ensure repression of macroautophagy during mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation of proteins is crucial for fundamental cellular processes. Despite increasing examples of DNA ADP-ribosylation, the impact of this modification on DNA metabolism and cell physiology is unknown. Here, we show that the DarTG toxin-antitoxin system from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) catalyzes reversible ADP-ribosylation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The DarT toxin recognizes specific sequence motifs. EPEC DarG abrogates DarT toxicity by two distinct mechanisms: removal of DNA ADP-ribose (ADPr) groups and DarT sequestration. Furthermore, we investigate how cells recognize and deal with DNA ADP-ribosylation. We demonstrate that DNA ADPr stalls replication and is perceived as DNA damage. Removal of ADPr from DNA requires the sequential activity of two DNA repair pathways, with RecF-mediated homologous recombination likely to transfer ADP-ribosylation from single- to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and subsequent nucleotide excision repair eliminating the lesion. Our work demonstrates that these DNA repair pathways prevent the genotoxic effects of DNA ADP-ribosylation.

Abstract: Summary
The genomes of mammalian neurons contain uniquely high levels of non-CG DNA methylation that can be bound by the Rett syndrome protein, MeCP2, to regulate gene expression. How patterns of non-CG methylation are established in neurons and the mechanism by which this methylation works with MeCP2 to control gene expression is unclear. Here, we find that genes repressed by MeCP2 are often located within megabase-scale regions of high non-CG methylation that correspond with topologically associating domains of chromatin folding. MeCP2 represses enhancers found in these domains that are enriched for non-CG and CG methylation, with the strongest repression occurring for enhancers located within MeCP2-repressed genes. These alterations in enhancer activity provide a mechanism for how MeCP2 disruption in disease can lead to widespread changes in gene expression. Hence, we find that DNA topology can shape non-CG DNA methylation across the genome to dictate MeCP2-mediated enhancer regulation in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Streptomyces are our primary source of antibiotics, produced concomitantly with the transition from vegetative growth to sporulation in a complex developmental life cycle. We previously showed that the signaling molecule c-di-GMP binds BldD, a master repressor, to control initiation of development. Here we demonstrate that c-di-GMP also intervenes later in development to control differentiation of the reproductive hyphae into spores by arming a novel anti-σ (RsiG) to bind and sequester a sporulation-specific σ factor (σWhiG). We present the structure of the RsiG-(c-di-GMP)2-σWhiG complex, revealing an unusual, partially intercalated c-di-GMP dimer bound at the RsiG-σWhiG interface. RsiG binds c-di-GMP in the absence of σWhiG, employing a novel E(X)3S(X)2R(X)3Q(X)3D motif repeated on each helix of a coiled coil. Further studies demonstrate that c-di-GMP is essential for RsiG to inhibit σWhiG. These findings reveal a newly described control mechanism for σ-anti-σ complex formation and establish c-di-GMP as the central integrator of Streptomyces development.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate during glycolysis. The PK isoform PKM2 has additional roles in regulation of gene transcription and protein phosphorylation. PKM2 has been shown to control macrophage metabolic remodeling in inflammation, but its role in T cell biology is poorly understood. Here, we report PKM2 upregulation, phosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation in murine and human CD4+ T cells following activation in vitro. Treatment of T cells with TEPP-46, an allosteric activator that induces PKM2 tetramerization and blocks its nuclear translocation, strongly reduces their activation, proliferation, and cytokine production by inhibiting essential signaling pathways and thus preventing the engagement of glycolysis. TEPP-46 limits the development of both T helper 17 (Th17) and Th1 cells in vitro and ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in vivo. Overall, our results suggest that pharmacological targeting of PKM2 may represent a valuable therapeutic approach in T cell-mediated inflammation and autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulated expression of MYC induces a dependence on the NUAK1 kinase, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that NUAK1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates with a network of nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactors and that PNUTS, a nuclear regulatory subunit of PP1, is phosphorylated by NUAK1. Both NUAK1 and PNUTS associate with the splicing machinery. Inhibition of NUAK1 abolishes chromatin association of PNUTS, reduces spliceosome activity, and suppresses nascent RNA synthesis. Activation of MYC does not bypass the requirement for NUAK1 for spliceosome activity but significantly attenuates transcription inhibition. Consequently, NUAK1 inhibition in MYC-transformed cells induces global accumulation of RNAPII both at the pause site and at the first exon-intron boundary but does not increase mRNA synthesis. We suggest that NUAK1 inhibition in the presence of deregulated MYC traps non-productive RNAPII because of the absence of correctly assembled spliceosomes.

Abstract: Energy metabolism impairment is a central event in the pathophysiology of ischemia. The limited availability of glucose and oxygen strongly affects mitochondrial activity, thus leading to ATP depletion. In this setting, the switch to alternative energy sources could ameliorate cells survival by enhancing ATP production, thus representing an attractive strategy for ischemic treatment. In this regard, some studies have recently re-evaluated the metabolic role of glutamate and its potential to promote cell survival under pathological conditions. In the present review, we discuss the ability of glutamate to exert an “energizing role” in cardiac and neuronal models of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury, focusing on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and the Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) as key players in this metabolic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Imprinted genes with parental-biased allelic expression are frequently co-regulated and enriched in common biological pathways. Here, we functionally characterize a large cluster of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed from the maternally inherited allele (“maternally expressed”) to explore the molecular and cellular consequences of imprinted miRNA activity. Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show that maternally expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to transcriptional and developmental regulators, including paternally expressed transcripts like Plagl1. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster resulted in increased protein levels of several targets and upregulation of a broader transcriptional program regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function. A subset of the transcriptional changes resulting from miR-379/410 deletion can be attributed to de-repression of Plagl1. These data suggest maternally expressed miRNAs antagonize paternally driven gene programs in neurons.

Abstract: Aggregation or phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is the pathological hallmark in a number of diseases termed tauopathies, which include the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s disease; or frontotemporal dementia, linked to mutations in the gene MAPT encoding tau. Although misfolded tau has strong familial and histopathological (as in intracellular tangles) association with neurodegenerative disorders, the cellular mechanism of tau-induced pathology remains to be controversial. Here we studied the effect of tau on the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis using primary cortical cultures treated with the protein and iPSC-derived neurons bearing the 10 + 16 MAPT mutation linked to frontotemporal dementia. We found that incubation of the primary cortical co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes with tau induced spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in the neurons, which were also observed in iPSC-neurons with the 10 + 16 MAPT mutation. Importantly, tau inhibited mitochondrial calcium efflux via the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX) in both neurons and astrocytes. This inhibition led to mitochondrial depolarisation in response to physiological and pathological calcium stimuli and made these cells vulnerable to calcium-induced caspase 3 activation and cell death. Thus, inhibition of the mitochondrial NCLX in neurons with misfolded or mutated tau can be involved in the mechanism of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: EPAS1, FSTL3, IGFBP1, and SEMA3C were localized to determine whether expression is decidual, trophoblastic, or both in the human first trimester maternal-fetoplacental interface. Identified on global genome-wide microarray analysis of chorionic villus sampling tissues in preclinical preeclampsia, these targets were predicted to interact by bioinformatics pathways analysis. In situ hybridization (ISH) with mRNA of each gene was conducted in 10 cases of archived first trimester termination tissues. Randomly selected areas of cells by tissue type yielded the relative proportion of cells expressing mRNA signal in decidual and fetoplacental sites. Data were analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p ≤ .05). The average gestational age was 10.2 weeks. Expression signal for each gene differed by cell type (p < .001). FSTL3 expression was 17 times higher in cells of anchoring columns than areas of decidua without ISH signal. SEMA3C was three times higher in cells of anchoring columns than in decidua. EPAS1 was 1.31 times higher in cells of anchoring columns than in areas of decidua. IGFBP1 was 20 times higher in some decidua versus cells in anchoring columns or villous trophoblast. While all targets were expressed by both maternal and fetoplacental cells, our localizations identified which compartment had relatively higher expression of each gene.

Abstract: Summary
The role of hepatic lipoprotein metabolism in diet-induced remission of type 2 diabetes is currently unclear. Here, we determined the contributions of hepatic VLDL1-triglyceride production rate and VLDL1-palmitic acid content to changes in intra-pancreatic fat and return of first phase insulin response in a subgroup of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial. Liver fat, VLDL1-triglyceride production, and intra-pancreatic fat decreased after weight loss and remained normalized after 24 months of remission. First-phase insulin response remained increased only in those maintaining diabetes remission. Compared with those in remission at 24 months, individuals who relapsed after initial remission had a greater rise in the content of VLDL1-triglyceride and VLDL1-palmitic acid, re-accumulated intra-pancreatic fat, and lost first-phase response by 24 months. Thus, we observed temporal relationships between VLDL1-triglyceride production, hepatic palmitic acid flux, intra-pancreatic fat, and β-cell function. Weight-related disordered fat metabolism appears to drive development and reversal of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Ants acquire distinct morphological and behavioral phenotypes arising from a common genome, underscoring the importance of epigenetic regulation. In Camponotus floridanus, “Major” workers defend the colony, but can be epigenetically reprogrammed to forage for food analogously to “Minor” workers. Here, we utilize reprogramming to investigate natural behavioral specification. Reprogramming of Majors upregulates Minor-biased genes and downregulates Major-biased genes, engaging molecular pathways fundamental to foraging behavior. We discover the neuronal corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST) is upregulated upon reprogramming and required for the epigenetic switch to foraging. Genome-wide profiling during reprogramming reveals CoREST represses expression of enzymes that degrade juvenile hormone (JH), a hormone elevated upon reprogramming. High CoREST, low JH-degrader expression, and high JH levels are mirrored in natural Minors, revealing parallel mechanisms of natural and reprogrammed foraging. These results unveil chromatin regulation via CoREST as central to programming of ant social behavior, with potential far-reaching implications for behavioral epigenetics.

Abstract: Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by immunomodulatory properties along with the high proliferative and paracrine activity, as well as multilineage potency. The effects of MSCs on the T cell adaptive immunity are of a special interest. Low O2 level (1–7 %) is known to be typical for the putative site of the MSC – T cell interactions. A comparative evaluation of the effects of adipose tissue derived MSC (ASCs) on the mitogen-stimulated T cells at the ambient (20 %) and tissue-related (5 %) O2 levels demonstrated reduced T cell activation by the HLA-DR expression, decreased pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production in co-culture, inhibited T cell proliferation, with the effects increased at hypoxia. T cell interactions with ASCs resulted in the up-regulation of PDCD1, Foxp3, and TGFβ1 known to play an important role in the immune response suppression, and in the down-regulation of genes involved in the inflammatory reaction (IL2, IFNG). These changes were significantly increased under hypoxia. At the same time, neither ASCs nor the reduced O2 level had negative effects on the viability of T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mutation and prevalence of pathogenic viruses prompt the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Viperin is a potent antiviral protein that inhibits a broad range of viruses. Unexpectedly, we found that Viperin protein production in epithelium is defective in response to both viruses and interferons (IFNs). We further revealed that viruses and IFNs stimulate expression of the acetyltransferase HAT1, which induces Lys197-acetylation on Viperin. Viperin acetylation in turn recruits UBE4A that stimulates K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys206 of Viperin, leading to Viperin protein degradation. Importantly, UBE4A deficiency restores Viperin protein production in epithelium. We then designed interfering peptides (IPs) to inhibit UBE4A binding with Viperin. We found that VIP-IP3 rescues Viperin protein production in epithelium and therefore enhances cellular antiviral activity. VIP-IP3 renders mice more resistant to viral infection. These findings could provide strategies for both enhancing host broad-spectrum antiviral response and improving the efficacy of IFN-based antiviral therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The inner nuclear membrane (INM) is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but harbors a distinctive proteome essential for nuclear functions. In yeast, the Asi1/Asi2/Asi3 ubiquitin ligase complex safeguards the INM proteome through the clearance of mislocalized ER membrane proteins. How the Asi complex selectively targets mislocalized proteins and coordinates its activity with other ER functions, such as protein biogenesis, is unclear. Here, we uncover a link between INM proteome identity and membrane protein complex assembly in the remaining ER. We show that lone proteins and complex subunits failing to assemble in the ER access the INM for Asi-mediated degradation. Substrates are recognized by direct binding of Asi2 to their transmembrane domains for subsequent ubiquitination by Asi1/Asi3 and membrane extraction. Our data suggest a model in which spatial segregation of membrane protein complex assembly and quality control improves assembly efficiency and reduces the levels of orphan subunits.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose is the essential energy source for the brain, whose deficit, triggered by energy deprivation or therapeutic agents, can be fatal. Increased appetite is the key behavioral defense against hypoglycemia; however, the central pathways involved are not well understood. Here, we describe a glucoprivic feeding pathway by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons from nucleus of solitary tract (NTS), which project densely to the hypothalamus and elicit feeding through bidirectional adrenergic modulation of agouti-related peptide (AgRP)- and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. Acute chemogenetic inhibition of arcuate nucleus (ARC)-projecting NTSTH neurons or their target, AgRP neurons, impaired glucoprivic feeding induced by 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) injection. Neuroanatomical tracing results suggested that ARC-projecting orexigenic NTSTH neurons are largely distinct from neighboring catecholamine neurons projecting to parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that promotes satiety. Collectively, we describe a circuit organization in which an ascending pathway from brainstem stimulates appetite through key hunger neurons in the hypothalamus in response to hypoglycemia.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogen-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activate NFκB with distinct duration dynamics, but how immune response genes decode NFκB duration to produce stimulus-specific expression remains unclear. Here, detailed transcriptomic profiling of combinatorial and temporal control mutants identified 81 genes that depend on stimulus-specific NFκB duration for their stimulus-specificity. Combining quantitative experimentation with mathematical modeling, we found that for some genes a long mRNA half-life allowed effective decoding, but for many genes this was insufficient to account for the data; instead, we found that chromatin mechanisms, such as a slow transition rate between inactive and RelA-bound enhancer states, could also decode NFκB dynamics. Chromatin-mediated decoding is favored by genes acting as immune effectors (e.g., tissue remodelers and T cell recruiters) rather than immune regulators (e.g., signaling proteins and monocyte recruiters). Overall, our results delineate two gene regulatory strategies that decode stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics and determine distinct biological functions.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1-infected infants develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) more rapidly than adults, suggesting differences in the neonatal versus adult responses to the HIV-1 envelope (Env). Here, trimeric forms of HIV-1 Env immunogens elicit increased gp120- and gp41-specific antibodies more rapidly in neonatal macaques than adult macaques. Transcriptome analyses of neonatal versus adult immune cells after Env vaccination reveal that neonatal macaques have higher levels of the apoptosis regulator BCL2 in T cells and lower levels of the immunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor alpha (IL10RA) mRNA transcripts in T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. In addition, immunized neonatal macaques exhibit increased frequencies of activated blood T follicular helper-like (Tfh) cells compared to adults. Thus, neonatal macaques have transcriptome signatures of decreased immunosuppression and apoptosis compared with adult macaques, providing an immune landscape conducive to early-life immunization prior to sexual debut.

Abstract: Summary
The secreted protein calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) utilizes a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain to bind to and potentiate the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A. To gain insight into this unique potentiation mechanism, we determined the 2.0-Å crystal structure of human CLCA1 VWA bound to Ca2+. The structure reveals the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in a high-affinity “open” conformation, engaging in crystal contacts that likely mimic how CLCA1 engages TMEM16A. The CLCA1 VWA contains a disulfide bond between α3 and α4 in close proximity to the MIDAS that is invariant in the CLCA family and unique in VWA structures. Further biophysical studies indicate that CLCA1 VWA is preferably stabilized by Mg2+ over Ca2+ and that α6 atypically extends from the VWA core. Finally, an analysis of TMEM16A structures suggests residues likely to mediate interaction with CLCA1 VWA.

Abstract: Artemia salina is an extremophile species that tolerates a wide range of salinity, especially hypertonic media considered lethal for the majority of other aquatic species. In this study, A. salina cysts were hatched in the laboratory and nauplii were acclimated at three different salinities (60, 139 and 212 ppt). Once in the adult phase, their hemolymph osmolality was measured. The animals were strong hypo-osmoregulators in the entire range of tested salinities, with up to 10 fold lower hemolymph osmolalities than their surrounding environment. Immunostaining of Na+/K+-ATPase was done on sections and on whole body mounts of adults in order to localize the ionocytes in different organs. An intense Na+/K+-ATPase immunostaining throughout the cells was observed in the epithelium of the ten pairs of metepipodites. A positive immunoreactivity for Na+/K+-ATPase was also detected in the maxillary glands, in the epithelium of the efferent tubule and of the excretory canal, as well as in the anterior digestive tract. This study confirms the strong hypo-osmotic capacity of this species and affords an overview of the different organs involved in osmoregulation in A. salina adults.

Abstract: Summary
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a critical tumor suppressor in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). It is important to identify additional therapeutic targets in ccRCC downstream of VHL loss besides hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α). By performing a genome-wide screen, we identified Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 1 (SFMBT1) as a candidate pVHL target. SFMBT1 was considered to be a transcriptional repressor but its role in cancer remains unclear. ccRCC patients with VHL loss-of-function mutations displayed elevated SFMBT1 protein levels. SFMBT1 hydroxylation on Proline residue 651 by EglN1 mediated its ubiquitination and degradation governed by pVHL. Depletion of SFMBT1 abolished ccRCC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated analyses of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and patient prognosis identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as a key SFMBT1 target gene contributing to its oncogenic phenotype. Therefore, the pVHL-SFMBT1-SPHK1 axis serves as a potential therapeutic avenue for ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), and sepiapterin reductase (SR) are sequentially responsible for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a known co-factor for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems encode RNA-guided surveillance complexes to find and cleave invading DNA elements. While it is thought that invaders are neutralized minutes after cell entry, the mechanism and kinetics of target search and its impact on CRISPR protection levels have remained unknown. Here, we visualize individual Cascade complexes in a native type I CRISPR-Cas system. We uncover an exponential relation between Cascade copy number and CRISPR interference levels, pointing to a time-driven arms race between invader replication and target search, in which 20 Cascade complexes provide 50% protection. Driven by PAM-interacting subunit Cas8e, Cascade spends half its search time rapidly probing DNA (∼30 ms) in the nucleoid. We further demonstrate that target DNA transcription and CRISPR arrays affect the integrity of Cascade and affect CRISPR interference. Our work establishes the mechanism of cellular DNA surveillance by Cascade that allows the timely detection of invading DNA in a crowded, DNA-packed environment.

Abstract: Summary
The explosion of data throughout the biomedical sciences provides unprecedented opportunities to learn about the dynamics of evolution and disease progression, but harnessing these large and diverse datasets remains challenging. Here, we describe a highly generalizable statistical platform to infer the dynamic pathways by which many, potentially interacting, traits are acquired or lost over time. We use HyperTraPS (hypercubic transition path sampling) to efficiently learn progression pathways from cross-sectional, longitudinal, or phylogenetically linked data, readily distinguishing multiple competing pathways, and identifying the most parsimonious mechanisms underlying given observations. This Bayesian approach allows inclusion of prior knowledge, quantifies uncertainty in pathway structure, and allows predictions, such as which symptom a patient will acquire next. We provide visualization tools for intuitive assessment of multiple, variable pathways. We apply the method to ovarian cancer progression and the evolution of multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, demonstrating its power to reveal previously undetected dynamic pathways.

Dedifferentiation of mature cells is an intriguing cellular process associated with regeneration of several organs. During zebrafish fin regeneration, osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic progenitors that provide source cells for bone restoration. We performed a high-content in vivo chemical screen for regulators of osteoblast dedifferentiation and fin regenerative growth. NF-κB signaling emerged as a specific regulator of dedifferentiation. The pathway is active in mature osteoblasts and downregulated prior to dedifferentiation. Pathway activation blocked osteoblast dedifferentiation, while NF-κB signaling inhibition enhanced dedifferentiation. Conditional Cre-lox-mediated NF-κB signaling manipulation specifically in osteoblasts showed that the pathway acts cell autonomously to interfere with osteoblast dedifferentiation. NF-κB signaling acts upstream of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, which also needs to be downregulated for dedifferentiation to occur, via suppression of the RA-degrading enzyme cyp26b1. Our findings shed light on the molecular regulation of regenerative cellular plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Ephrins can elicit either contact-mediated cell-cell adhesion or repulsion, depending on the efficiency of the removal of their ligand-receptor complexes from the cell surface, thus controlling tissue morphogenesis and oncogenic development. However, the dynamic of the turnover of newly assembled ephrin-Eph complexes during cell-cell interactions remains mostly unexplored. Here, we show that ephrin-A1-EphA2 complexes are locally formed at the tip of the filopodia, at cell-to-cell contacts. Clusters of ephrin-A1 from donor cells surf on filopodia associated to EphA2-bearing subdomains of acceptor cells. Full-length ephrin-A1 is transferred to acceptor cells by trans-endocytosis through a proteolysis-independent mechanism. Trans-endocytosed ephrin-A1 bound to its receptor enables signaling to be emitted from endo-lysosomes of acceptor cells. Localized trans-endocytosis of ephrin-A1 sustains contact-mediated repulsion on cancer cells. Our results uncover the essential role played by local concentration at the tip of filopodia and the trans-endocytosis of full-length ephrin to maintain long-lasting ephrin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory signaling pathways are tightly regulated to avoid chronic inflammation and the development of disease. OTULIN is a deubiquitinating enzyme that controls inflammation by cleaving linear ubiquitin chains generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. Here, we show that ablation of OTULIN in liver parenchymal cells in mice causes severe liver disease which is characterized by liver inflammation, hepatocyte apoptosis, and compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, leading to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic ablation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) completely rescues and knockin expression of kinase inactive receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) significantly protects mice from developing liver disease, demonstrating that apoptosis of OTULIN-deficient hepatocytes triggers disease pathogenesis in this model. Finally, we demonstrate that type I interferons contribute to disease in hepatocyte-specific OTULIN-deficient mice. Our study reveals the critical importance of OTULIN in protecting hepatocytes from death, thereby preventing the development of chronic liver inflammation and HCC.

Abstract: Despite profound knowledge of the incidence of oral cancers and a large body of research beyond it, it continues to beat diagnosis and treatment management. Post physical observation by clinicians, a biopsy is a gold standard for accurate detection of any abnormalities. Towards the application of artificial intelligence as an aid to diagnosis, automated cell nuclei segmentation is the most essential step for the recognition of the cancer cells. In this study, we have extracted the shape, texture and color features from the histopathological images collected indigenously from regional hospitals. A dataset of 42 whole slide slices was used to automatically segment and generate a cell level dataset of 720 nuclei. Next, different classifiers were applied for classification purposes. 99.4 % accuracy using Decision Tree Classifier, 100 % accuracy using both SVM and Logistic regression and 100 % accuracy using SVM, Logistic regression and Linear Discriminant were acquired for shape, textural and color features respectively. The in-depth analysis showed SVM and Linear Discriminant classifier gave the best result for texture and color features respectively. The achieved result can be effectively converted to software as an assistant diagnostic tool.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamine is an essential nutrient that regulates energy production, redox homeostasis, and signaling in cancer cells. Despite the importance of glutamine in mitochondrial metabolism, the mitochondrial glutamine transporter has long been unknown. Here, we show that the SLC1A5 variant plays a critical role in cancer metabolic reprogramming by transporting glutamine into mitochondria. The SLC1A5 variant has an N-terminal targeting signal for mitochondrial localization. Hypoxia-induced gene expression of the SLC1A5 variant is mediated by HIF-2α. Overexpression of the SLC1A5 variant mediates glutamine-induced ATP production and glutathione synthesis and confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells. SLC1A5 variant knockdown and overexpression alter cancer cell and tumor growth, supporting an oncogenic role. This work demonstrates that the SLC1A5 variant is a mitochondrial glutamine transporter for cancer metabolic reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in biology is to understand how complex gene expression patterns are encoded in the genome. While transcriptional enhancers have been studied extensively, few transcriptional silencers have been identified, and they remain poorly understood. Here, we used a novel strategy to screen hundreds of sequences for tissue-specific silencer activity in whole Drosophila embryos. Almost all of the transcriptional silencers that we identified were also active enhancers in other cellular contexts. These elements are bound by more transcription factors than non-silencers. A subset of these silencers forms long-range contacts with promoters. Deletion of a silencer caused derepression of its target gene. Our results challenge the common practice of treating enhancers and silencers as separate classes of regulatory elements and suggest the possibility that thousands or more bifunctional CRMs remain to be discovered in Drosophila and 104–105 in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITFHigh melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITFLow cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneity of lung tumor endothelial cell (TEC) phenotypes across patients, species (human/mouse), and models (in vivo/in vitro) remains poorly inventoried at the single-cell level. We single-cell RNA (scRNA)-sequenced 56,771 endothelial cells from human/mouse (peri)-tumoral lung and cultured human lung TECs, and detected 17 known and 16 previously unrecognized phenotypes, including TECs putatively regulating immune surveillance. We resolved the canonical tip TECs into a known migratory tip and a putative basement-membrane remodeling breach phenotype. Tip TEC signatures correlated with patient survival, and tip/breach TECs were most sensitive to vascular endothelial growth factor blockade. Only tip TECs were congruent across species/models and shared conserved markers. Integrated analysis of the scRNA-sequenced data with orthogonal multi-omics and meta-analysis data across different human tumors, validated by functional analysis, identified collagen modification as a candidate angiogenic pathway.

Abstract: Deltex-3-like (DTX3L), an E3 ligase, which is also known as B-lymphoma and BAL-associated protein (BBAP), is a member of the Deltex (DTX) family and was originally identified as a binding partner of diphtheria-toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferase-9 (ARTD9). The present study found that DTX3L and ARTD9 were upregulated in synovial tissues obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients compared with those from the controls. Healthy synovial tissues were obtained by arthroscopic biopsy from patients with meniscus injury (n = 10 samples) without a history of RA in the Orthopedic Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. FLSs were isolated from RA patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty. We performed dual immunofluorescence staining on DTX3L and ARTD9, and these data strongly demonstrated that DTX3L and ARTD9 were colocalized with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in patients with RA. Furthermore, Western blot assays were performed to confirm that the expression levels of DTX3L and ARTD9 in the FLSs increased in a time-dependent manner and peaked at 24 h after TNF-α stimulation. Further, the inhibition of endogenous DTX3L and ARTD9 expression by RNA interference significantly suppressed the TNF-α-induced MMP-9 and IL-6 expression, as shown by Western blots. In contrast, overexpressing DTX3L and ARTD9 increased the MMP-9 and IL-6 mRNA levels in the TNF-α-stimulated FLSs. Moreover, DTX3L and ARTD9 associated with STAT1 under TNF-α-stimulated conditions to modulate STAT1 nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in an immunofluorescence staining assay. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that DTX3L and ARTD9 contribute to the production of inflammatory cytokines in FLSs from RA patients and may play a key role in the inflammatory process of RA via the STAT1 signal transduction pathway.

Abstract: Roles of mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX, were studied in B lymphocytes such as heterozygous NCLX knockout DT40 cells, NCLX knockdown A20 cells, and native mouse spleen B lymphocytes treated with a NCLX blocker, CGP-37157. Cytosolic Ca2+ response to B cell receptor stimulation was impaired in these B lymphocytes, demonstrating importance of mitochondria-ER Ca2+ recycling via NCLX and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase SERCA, and interaction with store-operated Ca2+ entry. NCLX was also associated with motility and chemotaxis of B lymphocyte. Contrary to B lymphocytes, contribution of NCLX in mouse spleen T lymphocytes was minor.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise is an effective strategy for diabetes management but is limited by the phenomenon of exercise resistance (i.e., the lack of or the adverse response to exercise on metabolic health). Here, in 39 medication-naive men with prediabetes, we found that exercise-induced alterations in the gut microbiota correlated closely with improvements in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (clinicaltrials.gov entry NCT03240978). The microbiome of responders exhibited an enhanced capacity for biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, whereas those of non-responders were characterized by increased production of metabolically detrimental compounds. Fecal microbial transplantation from responders, but not non-responders, mimicked the effects of exercise on alleviation of insulin resistance in obese mice. Furthermore, a machine-learning algorithm integrating baseline microbial signatures accurately predicted personalized glycemic response to exercise in an additional 30 subjects. These findings raise the possibility of maximizing the benefits of exercise by targeting the gut microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 50% of the mass of the Envelope (Env) glycoprotein surface subunit (gp120) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is composed of N-linked carbohydrate. Until now, the dogma has been that HIV-1 lacks O-linked carbohydrate on Env. Here we show that a subset of patient-derived HIV-1 isolates contain O-linked carbohydrate on the variable 1 (V1) domain of Env gp120. We demonstrate the presence of this O-glycosylation both on virions and on gp120 expressed as a secreted protein. Further, we establish that these O-linked glycans can confer a more than 1,000-fold decrease in neutralization sensitivity (IC50) to V3-glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies. These findings uncover a structural modification to the HIV-1 Env and suggest a functional role in promoting viral escape from one category of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) purges aberrant mRNAs and nascent polypeptides in a multi-step molecular process initiated by the E3 ligase ZNF598 through sensing of ribosomes collided at aberrant mRNAs and monoubiquitination of distinct small ribosomal subunit proteins. We show that G3BP1-family-USP10 complexes are required for deubiquitination of RPS2, RPS3, and RPS10 to rescue modified 40S subunits from programmed degradation. Knockout of USP10 or G3BP1 family proteins increased lysosomal ribosomal degradation and perturbed ribosomal subunit stoichiometry, both of which were rescued by a single K214R substitution of RPS3. While the majority of RPS2 and RPS3 monoubiquitination resulted from ZNF598-dependent sensing of ribosome collisions initiating RQC, another minor pathway contributed to their monoubiquitination. G3BP1 family proteins have long been considered RNA-binding proteins, however, our results identified 40S subunits and associated mRNAs as their predominant targets, a feature shared by stress granules to which G3BP1 family proteins localize under stress.

Abstract: Summary
Cells form spatial patterns by coordinating their gene expressions. How a group of mesoscopic numbers (hundreds to thousands) of cells, without pre-existing morphogen gradients and spatial organization, self-organizes spatial patterns remains poorly understood. Of particular importance are dynamic spatial patterns such as spiral waves that perpetually move and transmit information. We developed an open-source software for simulating a field of cells that communicate by secreting any number of molecules. With this software and a theory, we identified all possible “cellular dialogues”—ways of communicating with two diffusing molecules—that yield diverse dynamic spatial patterns. These patterns emerge despite widely varying responses of cells to the molecules, gene-expression noise, spatial arrangements, and cell movements. A three-stage, “order-fluctuate-settle” process forms dynamic spatial patterns: cells form long-lived whirlpools of wavelets that, following erratic dynamics, settle into a dynamic spatial pattern. Our work helps in identifying gene-regulatory networks that underlie dynamic pattern formations.

Abstract: Summary
Degradation of transcripts in human nuclei is primarily facilitated by the RNA exosome. To obtain substrate specificity, the exosome is aided by adaptors; in the nucleoplasm, those adaptors are the nuclear exosome-targeting (NEXT) complex and the poly(A) (pA) exosome-targeting (PAXT) connection. How these adaptors guide exosome targeting remains enigmatic. Employing high-resolution 3′ end sequencing, we demonstrate that NEXT substrates arise from heterogenous and predominantly pA− 3′ ends often covering kilobase-wide genomic regions. In contrast, PAXT targets harbor well-defined pA+ 3′ ends defined by canonical pA site use. Irrespective of this clear division, NEXT and PAXT act redundantly in two ways: (1) regional redundancy, where the majority of exosome-targeted transcription units produce NEXT- and PAXT-sensitive RNA isoforms, and (2) isoform redundancy, where the PAXT connection ensures fail-safe decay of post-transcriptionally polyadenylated NEXT targets. In conjunction, this provides a two-layered targeting mechanism for efficient nuclear sorting of the human transcriptome.

Abstract: Summary
U6 snRNA, as an essential component of the catalytic core of the pre-mRNA processing spliceosome, is heavily modified post-transcriptionally, with 2′-O-methylation being most common. The role of these modifications in pre-mRNA splicing as well as their physiological function in mammals have remained largely unclear. Here we report that the La-related protein LARP7 functions as a critical cofactor for 2′-O-methylation of U6 in mouse male germ cells. Mechanistically, LARP7 promotes U6 loading onto box C/D snoRNP, facilitating U6 2′-O-methylation by box C/D snoRNP. Importantly, ablation of LARP7 in the male germline causes defective U6 2′-O-methylation, massive alterations in pre-mRNA splicing, and spermatogenic failure in mice, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type LARP7 but not an U6-loading-deficient mutant LARP7. Our data uncover a novel role of LARP7 in regulating U6 2′-O-methylation and demonstrate the functional requirement of such modification for splicing fidelity and spermatogenesis in mice.
