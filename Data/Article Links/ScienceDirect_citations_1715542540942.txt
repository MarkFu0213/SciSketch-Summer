Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is associated with pleiotropic physiopathological processes, including aging and age-related diseases. The persistent DNA damage is a major stress leading to senescence, but the underlying molecular link remains elusive. Here, we identify La Ribonucleoprotein 7 (LARP7), a 7SK RNA binding protein, as an aging antagonist. DNA damage-mediated Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) activation triggers the extracellular shuttling and downregulation of LARP7, which dampens SIRT1 deacetylase activity, enhances p53 and NF-κB (p65) transcriptional activity by augmenting their acetylation, and thereby accelerates cellular senescence. Deletion of LARP7 leads to senescent cell accumulation and premature aging in rodent model. Furthermore, we show this ATM-LARP7-SIRT1-p53/p65 senescence axis is active in vascular senescence and atherogenesis, and preventing its activation substantially alleviates senescence and atherogenesis. Together, this study identifies LARP7 as a gatekeeper of senescence, and the altered ATM-LARP7-SIRT1-p53/p65 pathway plays an important role in DNA damage response (DDR)-mediated cellular senescence and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Stimuli-evoked and spontaneous brain activity propagates across the cortex in diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Despite extensive studies, the relationship between spontaneous and evoked activity is poorly understood. We investigate this relationship by comparing the amplitude, speed, direction, and complexity of propagation trajectories of spontaneous and evoked activity elicited with visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli using mesoscale wide-field imaging in mice. For both spontaneous and evoked activity, the speed and direction of propagation is modulated by the amplitude. However, spontaneous activity has a higher complexity of the propagation trajectories. For low stimulus strengths, evoked activity amplitude and speed is similar to that of spontaneous activity but becomes dissimilar at higher stimulus strengths. These findings are consistent with observations that primary sensory areas receive widespread inputs from other cortical regions, and during rest, the cortex tends to reactivate traces of complex multisensory experiences that might have occurred in exhibition of different behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse hematopoietic tissues contain abundant tissue-resident macrophages that support immunity, hematopoiesis, and bone homeostasis. A systematic strategy to characterize macrophage subsets in mouse bone marrow (BM), spleen, and lymph node unexpectedly reveals that macrophage surface marker staining emanates from membrane-bound subcellular remnants associated with unrelated cells. Intact macrophages are not present within these cell preparations. The macrophage remnant binding profile reflects interactions between macrophages and other cell types in vivo. Depletion of CD169+ macrophages in vivo eliminates F4/80+ remnant attachment. Remnant-restricted macrophage-specific membrane markers, cytoplasmic fluorescent reporters, and mRNA are all detected in non-macrophage cells including isolated stem and progenitor cells. Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, including publicly available datasets, indicates that macrophage fragmentation is a general phenomenon that confounds bulk and single-cell analysis of disaggregated hematopoietic tissues. Hematopoietic tissue macrophage fragmentation undermines the accuracy of macrophage ex vivo molecular profiling and creates opportunity for misattribution of macrophage-expressed genes to non-macrophage cells.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane proteins are prone to misfolding and degradation. This is particularly true for mammalian forms of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). Although they function at the plasma membrane, mammalian GnRHRs accumulate within the secretory pathway. Their apparent instability is believed to have evolved through selection for attenuated GnRHR activity. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of this adaptation remains unclear. We show that adaptation coincides with a C-terminal truncation that compromises the translocon-mediated membrane integration of its seventh transmembrane domain (TM7). We also identify a series of polar residues in mammalian GnRHRs that compromise the membrane integration of TM2 and TM6. Reverting a lipid-exposed polar residue in TM6 to an ancestral hydrophobic residue restores expression with no impact on function. Evolutionary trends suggest variations in the polarity of this residue track with reproductive phenotypes. Our findings suggest that the marginal energetics of cotranslational folding can be exploited to tune membrane protein fitness.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid storage in fat tissue is important for energy homeostasis and cellular functions. Through RNAi screening in Drosophila fat body, we found that knockdown of a Drosophila NAD kinase (NADK), which phosphorylates NAD to synthesize NADP de novo, causes lipid storage defects. NADK sustains lipogenesis by maintaining the pool of NADPH. Promoting NADPH production rescues the lipid storage defect in the fat body of NADK RNAi animals. Furthermore, NADK and fatty acid synthase 1 (FASN1) regulate mitochondrial mass and function by altering the levels of acetyl-CoA and fatty acids. Reducing the level of acetyl-CoA or increasing the synthesis of cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrion-specific phospholipid, partially rescues the mitochondrial defects of NADK RNAi. Therefore, NADK- and FASN1-mediated fatty acid synthesis coordinates lipid storage and mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses rearrange host membranes to support different entry steps. Polyomavirus simian virus 40 (SV40) reorganizes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to generate focus structures that enable virus ER-to-cytosol escape, a decisive infection step. The molecular architecture of the ER exit site that might illuminate why it is ideally suited for membrane penetration is unknown. Here 3D focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) reconstruction reveals that the ER focus structure consists of multi-tubular ER junctions where SV40 preferentially localizes, suggesting that tubular branch points are virus ER-to-cytosol penetration sites. Functional analysis demonstrates that lunapark—an ER membrane protein that typically stabilizes three-way ER junctions—relocates to the ER foci, where it supports focus formation, leading to SV40 ER escape and infection. Our results reveal how a virus repurposes the activity of an ER membrane protein to form a virus-induced ER substructure required for membrane escape and suggest that ER tubular junctions are vulnerable sites exploited by viruses for membrane penetration.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous metabolites, environmental agents, and therapeutic drugs promote formation of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs). Persistent DPCs compromise genome integrity and are eliminated by multiple repair pathways. Aberrant Top1-DNA crosslinks, or Top1ccs, are processed by Tdp1 and Wss1 functioning in parallel pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It remains obscure how cells choose between diverse mechanisms of DPC repair. Here, we show that several SUMO biogenesis factors (Ulp1, Siz2, Slx5, and Slx8) control repair of Top1cc or an analogous DPC lesion. Genetic analysis reveals that SUMO promotes Top1cc processing in the absence of Tdp1 but has an inhibitory role if cells additionally lack Wss1. In the tdp1Δ wss1Δ mutant, the E3 SUMO ligase Siz2 stimulates sumoylation in the vicinity of the DPC, but not SUMO conjugation to Top1. This Siz2-dependent sumoylation inhibits alternative DPC repair mechanisms, including Ddi1. Our findings suggest that SUMO tunes available repair pathways to facilitate faithful DPC repair.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. Increased sulfide production or sulfide donor compounds may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver- enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Tst−/− mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels are normal in Tst−/− mice because of exaggerated induction of sulfide disposal, with associated suppression of global protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor 2 target protein levels. Hepatic proteomic and persulfidomic profiles converge on gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, revealing a selective deficit in medium-chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst−/− mice. We reveal a critical role of TST in hepatic metabolism that has implications for sulfide donor strategies in the context of metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that occurs with aging and disease, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Previous work determined that common transcriptional changes occur in muscle during atrophy induced by different stimuli. However, whether this holds true at the proteome level remains largely unexplored. Here, we find that, contrary to this earlier model, distinct atrophic stimuli (corticosteroids, cancer cachexia, and aging) induce largely different mRNA and protein changes during muscle atrophy in mice. Moreover, there is widespread transcriptome-proteome disconnect. Consequently, atrophy markers (atrogenes) identified in earlier microarray-based studies do not emerge from proteomics as generally induced by atrophy. Rather, we identify proteins that are distinctly modulated by different types of atrophy (herein defined as “atroproteins”) such as the myokine CCN1/Cyr61, which regulates myofiber type switching during sarcopenia. Altogether, these integrated analyses indicate that different catabolic stimuli induce muscle atrophy via largely distinct mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is critical for cellular signal transduction, receptor recycling, and membrane homeostasis in mammalian cells. Acute depletion of cholesterol disrupts CME, motivating analysis of CME dynamics in the context of human disorders of cholesterol metabolism. We report that inhibition of post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis impairs CME. Imaging of membrane bending dynamics and the CME pit ultrastructure reveals prolonged clathrin pit lifetimes and shallow clathrin-coated structures, suggesting progressive impairment of curvature generation correlates with diminishing sterol abundance. Sterol structural requirements for efficient CME include 3′ polar head group and B-ring conformation, resembling the sterol structural prerequisites for tight lipid packing and polarity. Furthermore, Smith-Lemli-Opitz fibroblasts with low cholesterol abundance exhibit deficits in CME-mediated transferrin internalization. We conclude that sterols lower the energetic costs of membrane bending during pit formation and vesicular scission during CME and suggest that reduced CME activity may contribute to cellular phenotypes observed within disorders of cholesterol metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) regulate many biological processes through mechanisms that are not fully understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs intersect the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, involving a distinct class of small RNAs called 22G-RNAs, to regulate gene expression in the germline. In the absence of piRNAs, 22G-RNA production from many genes is reduced, pointing to a role for piRNAs in facilitating endogenous RNAi. Here, however, we show that many genes gain, rather than lose, 22G-RNAs in the absence of piRNAs, which is in some instances coincident with RNA silencing. Aberrant 22G-RNA production is somewhat stochastic but once established can occur within a population for at least 50 generations. Thus, piRNAs both promote and suppress 22G-RNA production and gene silencing. rRNAs and histones are hypersusceptible to aberrant silencing, but we do not find evidence that their misexpression is the primary cause of the transgenerational sterility observed in piRNA-defective mutants.

Abstract: Summary
Stem and progenitor cells have the capacity to balance self-renewal and differentiation. Hematopoietic myeloid progenitors replenish more than 25 billion terminally differentiated neutrophils every day under homeostatic conditions and can increase this output in response to stress or infection. At what point along the spectrum of maturation do progenitors lose capacity for self-renewal and become irreversibly committed to differentiation? Using a system of conditional myeloid development that can be toggled between self-renewal and differentiation, we interrogate determinants of this “point of no return” in differentiation commitment. Irreversible commitment is due primarily to loss of open regulatory site access and disruption of a positive feedback transcription factor activation loop. Restoration of the transcription factor feedback loop extends the window of cell plasticity and alters the point of no return. These findings demonstrate how the chromatin state enforces and perpetuates cell fate and identify potential avenues for manipulating cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a specific type of DNA lesion in which proteins are covalently attached to DNA. Unrepaired DPCs lead to genomic instability, cancer, neurodegeneration, and accelerated aging. DPC proteolysis was recently identified as a specialized pathway for DPC repair. The DNA-dependent protease SPRTN and the 26S proteasome emerged as two independent proteolytic systems. DPCs are also repaired by homologous recombination (HR), a canonical DNA repair pathway. While studying the cellular response to DPC formation, we identify ubiquitylation and SUMOylation as two major signaling events in DNA replication-coupled DPC repair. DPC ubiquitylation recruits SPRTN to repair sites, promoting DPC removal. DPC SUMOylation prevents DNA double-strand break formation, HR activation, and potentially deleterious genomic rearrangements. In this way, SUMOylation channels DPC repair toward SPRTN proteolysis, which is a safer pathway choice for DPC repair and prevention of genomic instability.

Abstract: The emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ensures that drug discovery efforts remain at the forefront of TB research. There are multiple different experimental approaches that can be employed in the discovery of anti-TB agents. Notably, inhibitors of MmpL3 are numerous and structurally diverse in Mtb and have been discovered through the generation of spontaneous resistant mutants and subsequent whole genome sequencing studies. However, this approach is not always reliable and can lead to incorrect target assignment and requires orthogonal confirmatory approaches. In fact, many of these inhibitors have also been shown to act as multi-target agents, with secondary targets in Mtb, as well as in other non-MmpL3-containing pathogens. Herein, we have investigated further the cellular targets of the MmpL3-inhibitor BM212 and a number of BM212 analogues. To determine the alternative targets of BM212, which may have been masked by MmpL3 mutations, we have applied a combination of chemo-proteomic profiling using bead-immobilised BM212 derivatives and protein extracts, along with whole-cell and biochemical assays. The study identified EthR2 (Rv0078) as a protein that binds BM212 analogues. We further demonstrated binding of BM212 to EthR2 through an in vitro tryptophan fluorescence assay, which showed significant quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of BM212. Our studies have demonstrated the value of revisiting drugs with ambiguous targets, such as MmpL3, in an attempt to find alternative targets and the study of off-target effects to understand more precisely target engagement of new hits emerging from drug screening campaigns.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is an angiogenesis-inducing oncovirus whose ability to usurp the oxygen-sensing machinery is central to its oncogenicity. By upregulating the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), KSHV reprograms infected cells to a hypoxia-like state, triggering angiogenesis. Here we identify a link between KSHV replicative biology and oncogenicity by showing that KSHV's ability to regulate HIF2α levels and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in normoxia enables translation of viral lytic mRNAs through the HIF2α-regulated eIF4E2 translation-initiation complex. This mechanism of translation in infected cells is critical for lytic protein synthesis and contributes to KSHV-induced PDGFRA activation and VEGF secretion. Thus, KSHV regulation of the oxygen-sensing machinery allows virally infected cells to initiate translation via the mTOR-dependent eIF4E1 or the HIF2α-dependent, mTOR-independent, eIF4E2. This “translation initiation plasticity” (TRIP) is an oncoviral strategy used to optimize viral protein expression that links molecular strategies of viral replication to angiogenicity and oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway exerting various cytoprotective and homeostatic functions by using de novo double-membrane vesicle (autophagosome) formation to target a wide range of cytoplasmic material for vacuolar/lysosomal degradation. The Atg1 kinase is one of its key regulators, coordinating a complex signaling program to orchestrate autophagosome formation. Combining in vitro reconstitution and cell-based approaches, we demonstrate that Atg1 is activated by lipidated Atg8 (Atg8-PE), stimulating substrate phosphorylation along the growing autophagosomal membrane. Atg1-dependent phosphorylation of Atg13 triggers Atg1 complex dissociation, enabling rapid turnover of Atg1 complex subunits at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). Moreover, Atg1 recruitment by Atg8-PE self-regulates Atg8-PE levels in the growing autophagosomal membrane by phosphorylating and thus inhibiting the Atg8-specific E2 and E3. Our work uncovers the molecular basis for positive and negative feedback imposed by Atg1 and how opposing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events underlie the spatiotemporal regulation of autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells utilize rapidly elevated cellular antioxidant programs to accommodate chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we screen redox-sensitive effectors as potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and find that cyclophilin A (CypA) is a compelling candidate. Our results show that CypA forms an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys115 and Cys161 upon oxidative stress and the oxidized cysteines in CypA are recycled to a reduced state by peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2). Furthermore, CypA reduces cellular reactive oxygen species levels and increases CRC cell survival under insults of H2O2 and chemotherapeutics through a CypA-PRDX2-mediated antioxidant apparatus. Notably, CypA is upregulated in chemoresistant CRC samples, which predicts poor prognosis. Moreover, targeting CypA by cyclosporine A exhibits promising efficacy against chemoresistant CRC when combined with chemotherapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an Aedes-mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes debilitating congenital and developmental disorders. Improved understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis could assist efforts to fill the therapeutic and vaccine gap. We use several ZIKV strains, including a pair differing by a single phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution (M-F37L) in the membrane (M) protein, coupled with unbiased genomics to demarcate the border between attenuated and pathogenic infection. We identify infection-induced metabolic dysregulation as a minimal set of host alterations that differentiates attenuated from pathogenic ZIKV strains. Glycolytic rewiring results in impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction that trigger inflammation and apoptosis in pathogenic but not attenuated ZIKV strains. Critically, pyruvate supplementation prevents cell death, in vitro, and rescues fetal development in ZIKV-infected dams. Our findings thus demonstrate dysregulated metabolism as an underpinning of ZIKV pathogenicity and raise the potential of pyruvate supplementation in expectant women as a prophylaxis against congenital Zika syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a prefrontal region involved in processing the affective components of pain, display hyperexcitability in chronic neuropathic pain conditions, and their silencing abolishes hyperalgesia. We show that dopamine, through D1 receptor (D1R) signaling, inhibits pyramidal neurons of mouse ACC by modulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Activation of Gs-coupled D1R by dopamine induces the opening of HCN channels at physiological membrane potentials, driving a significant decrease in input resistance and excitability. Systemic L-DOPA in chronic neuropathic mice rescues HCN channel activity, normalizes pyramidal excitability in ACC, and blocks mechanical and thermal allodynia. Moreover, microinjection of a selective D1R agonist in the ACC relieves the aversiveness of ongoing neuropathic pain, while an ACC D1R antagonist blocks gabapentin- and lidocaine-evoked antinociception. We conclude that dopaminergic inhibition via D1R in ACC plays an analgesic role in physiological conditions and is decreased in chronic pain.

Abstract: Summary
Messenger RNA-based vaccines against COVID-19 induce a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response with potent viral neutralization activity. Antibody effector functions are determined by their constant region subclasses and by their glycosylation patterns, but their role in vaccine efficacy is unclear. Moreover, whether vaccination induces antibodies similar to those in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. We analyze BNT162b2 vaccine-induced IgG subclass distribution and Fc glycosylation patterns and their potential to drive effector function via Fcγ receptors and complement pathways. We identify unique and dynamic pro-inflammatory Fc compositions that are distinct from those in patients with COVID-19 and convalescents. Vaccine-induced anti-Spike IgG is characterized by distinct Fab- and Fc-mediated functions between different age groups and in comparison to antibodies generated during natural viral infection. These data highlight the heterogeneity of Fc responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and suggest that they support long-lasting protection differently.

Abstract: Summary
Pregnancy reprograms mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to control their responses to pregnancy hormone re-exposure and carcinoma progression. However, the influence of pregnancy on the mammary microenvironment is less clear. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the composition of epithelial and non-epithelial cells in mammary tissue from nulliparous and parous female mice. Our analysis indicates an expansion of γδ natural killer T-like immune cells (NKTs) following pregnancy and upregulation of immune signaling molecules in post-pregnancy MECs. We show that expansion of NKTs following pregnancy is due to elevated expression of the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d on MECs. Loss of CD1d expression on post-pregnancy MECs, or overall lack of activated NKTs, results in mammary oncogenesis. Collectively, our findings illustrate how pregnancy-induced changes modulate the communication between MECs and the immune microenvironment and establish a causal link between pregnancy, the immune microenvironment, and mammary oncogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
CCR4-NOT deadenylase is a major regulator of mRNA turnover. It contains two heterogeneous catalytic subunits CNOT7/8 and CNOT6/6L in vertebrates. The physiological function of each catalytic subunit is unclear due to the gene redundancy. In this study, Cnot6/6l double knockout mice are generated. Cnot6l−/− female mice are infertile, with poor ovarian responses to gonadotropins. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the transcription and translation of Cnot6 and Cnot6l in ovarian granulosa cells. CNOT6/6L function as key effectors of FSH in granulosa cells and trigger the clearance of specific transcripts in granulosa cells during preantral to antral follicle transition. These results demonstrate that FSH modulates granulosa cell function by stimulating selective translational activation and degradation of existing mRNAs, in addition to inducing de novo gene transcription. Meanwhile, this study provides in vivo evidence that CNOT6/6L-mediated mRNA deadenylation is dispensable in most somatic cell types, but is essential for female reproductive endocrine regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The neuroendocrine system coordinates metabolic and behavioral adaptations to fasting, including reducing energy expenditure, promoting counterregulation, and suppressing satiation and anxiety to engage refeeding. Here, we show that steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons is a key regulator of all these responses to fasting. POMC-specific deletion of SRC-2 enhances the basal excitability of POMC neurons; mutant mice fail to efficiently suppress energy expenditure during food deprivation. SRC-2 deficiency blunts electric responses of POMC neurons to glucose fluctuations, causing impaired counterregulation. When food becomes available, these mutant mice show insufficient refeeding associated with enhanced satiation and discoordination of anxiety and food-seeking behavior. SRC-2 coactivates Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) to suppress POMC gene expression. POMC-specific deletion of SRC-2 protects mice from weight gain induced by an obesogenic diet feeding and/or FoxO1 overexpression. Collectively, we identify SRC-2 as a key molecule that coordinates multifaceted adaptive responses to food shortage.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic tumors remain lethal due to primary/acquired resistance to therapy or cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated repopulation. We show that a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) activates starvation escape pathways in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which can be identified and targeted by drugs. In CSCs, FMD lowers glucose-dependent protein kinase A signaling and stemness markers to reduce cell number and increase mouse survival. Accordingly, metastatic TNBC patients with lower glycemia survive longer than those with higher baseline glycemia. By contrast, in differentiated cancer cells, FMD activates PI3K-AKT, mTOR, and CDK4/6 as survival/growth pathways, which can be targeted by drugs to promote tumor regression. FMD cycles also prevent hyperglycemia and other toxicities caused by these drugs. These data indicate that FMD has wide and differential effects on normal, cancer, and CSCs, allowing the rapid identification and targeting of starvation escape pathways and providing a method potentially applicable to many malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, and around every fourth person above the age of 40 is on statin medication. Therefore, it is of utmost clinical importance to understand the effect of statins on cancer cell plasticity and its consequences to not only patients with cancer but also patients who are on statins. Here, we find that statins induce a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in cancer cells of solid tumors. Using a comprehensive STRING network analysis of transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data combined with multiple mechanistic in vitro and functional in vivo analyses, we demonstrate that statins reduce cellular plasticity by enforcing a mesenchymal-like cell state that increases metastatic seeding ability on one side but reduces the formation of (secondary) tumors on the other due to heterogeneous treatment responses. Taken together, we provide a thorough mechanistic overview of the consequences of statin use for each step of cancer development, progression, and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Older age is a strong risk factor for several diseases, including cancer. The etiology and biology of age-associated differences among cancers are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we aim to delineate differences in tumor molecular characteristics between younger and older patients across a variety of tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that these groups exhibit widespread molecular differences in select tumor types. Our work shows that tumors in younger individuals exhibit a dysregulated molecular aging phenotype and are associated with hallmarks of premature senescence. Additionally, we find that these tumors are enriched for driver gene mutations, resulting in homologous recombination defects. Lastly, we observe a trend toward decreased immune infiltration and function in older patients and find that, immunologically, young tumor tissue resembles aged healthy tissue. Taken together, we find that tumors from young individuals possess unique characteristics that may be leveraged for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Legionella pneumophila grows intracellularly within a replication vacuole via action of Icm/Dot-secreted proteins. One such protein, SdhA, maintains the integrity of the vacuolar membrane, thereby preventing cytoplasmic degradation of bacteria. We show here that SdhA binds and blocks the action of OCRL (OculoCerebroRenal syndrome of Lowe), an inositol 5-phosphatase pivotal for controlling endosomal dynamics. OCRL depletion results in enhanced vacuole integrity and intracellular growth of a sdhA mutant, consistent with OCRL participating in vacuole disruption. Overexpressed SdhA alters OCRL function, enlarging endosomes, driving endosomal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and interfering with endosomal trafficking. SdhA interrupts Rab guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-OCRL interactions by binding to the OCRL ASPM-SPD2-Hydin (ASH) domain, without directly altering OCRL 5-phosphatase activity. The Legionella vacuole encompassing the sdhA mutant accumulates OCRL and endosomal antigen EEA1 (Early Endosome Antigen 1), consistent with SdhA blocking accumulation of OCRL-containing endosomal vesicles. Therefore, SdhA hijacking of OCRL is associated with blocking trafficking events that disrupt the pathogen vacuole.

Abstract: Summary
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are intracellular Ca2+ channels that link extracellular stimuli to Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is “quantal”: low IP3 concentrations rapidly release a fraction of the stores. Ca2+ release then slows or terminates without compromising responses to further IP3 additions. The mechanisms are unresolved. Here, we synthesize a high-affinity partial agonist of IP3Rs and use it to demonstrate that quantal responses do not require heterogenous Ca2+ stores. IP3Rs respond incrementally to IP3 and close after the initial response to low IP3 concentrations. Comparing functional responses with IP3 binding shows that only a tiny fraction of a cell’s IP3Rs mediate incremental Ca2+ release; inactivation does not therefore affect most IP3Rs. We conclude, and test by simulations, that Ca2+ signals evoked by IP3 pulses arise from rapid activation and then inactivation of very few IP3Rs. This allows IP3Rs to behave as increment detectors mediating graded Ca2+ release.

Abstract: Muscles generate forces for animal locomotion. The contractile apparatus of muscles is the sarcomere, a highly regular array of large actin and myosin filaments linked by gigantic titin springs. During muscle development many sarcomeres assemble in series into long periodic myofibrils that mechanically connect the attached skeleton elements. Thus, ATP-driven myosin forces can power movement of the skeleton. Here we review muscle and myofibril morphogenesis, with a particular focus on their mechanobiology. We describe recent progress on the molecular structure of sarcomeres and their mechanical connections to the skeleton. We discuss current models predicting how tension coordinates the assembly of key sarcomeric components to periodic myofibrils that then further mature during development. This requires transcriptional feedback mechanisms that may help to coordinate myofibril assembly and maturation states with the transcriptional program. To fuel the varying energy demands of muscles we also discuss the close mechanical interactions of myofibrils with mitochondria and nuclei to optimally support powerful or enduring muscle fibers.

Abstract: Summary
Parvalbumin and somatostatin inhibitory interneurons gate information flow in discrete cortical areas that compute sensory and cognitive functions. Despite the considerable differences between areas, individual interneuron subtypes are genetically invariant and are thought to form canonical circuits regardless of which area they are embedded in. Here, we investigate whether this is achieved through selective and systematic variations in their afferent connectivity during development. To this end, we examined the development of their inputs within distinct cortical areas. We find that interneuron afferents show little evidence of being globally stereotyped. Rather, each subtype displays characteristic regional connectivity and distinct developmental dynamics by which this connectivity is achieved. Moreover, afferents dynamically regulated during development are disrupted by early sensory deprivation and in a model of fragile X syndrome. These data provide a comprehensive map of interneuron afferents across cortical areas and reveal the logic by which these circuits are established during development.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is an inherent and important tumor suppressor mechanism. However, if not removed timely via immune surveillance, senescent cells also have detrimental effects. Although this has mostly been attributed to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of these cells, we recently proposed that “escape” from the senescent state is another unfavorable outcome. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we exploit genomic and functional data from a prototypical human epithelial cell model carrying an inducible CDC6 oncogene to identify an early-acquired recurrent chromosomal inversion that harbors a locus encoding the circadian transcription factor BHLHE40. This inversion alone suffices for BHLHE40 activation upon CDC6 induction and driving cell cycle re-entry of senescent cells, and malignant transformation. Ectopic overexpression of BHLHE40 prevented induction of CDC6-triggered senescence. We provide strong evidence in support of replication stress-induced genomic instability being a causative factor underlying “escape” from oncogene-induced senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Although prokaryotic organisms lack traditional organelles, they must still organize cellular structures in space and time, challenges that different species solve differently. To systematically define the subcellular architecture of mycobacteria, we perform high-throughput imaging of a library of fluorescently tagged proteins expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis and develop a customized computational pipeline, MOMIA and GEMATRIA, to analyze these data. Our results establish a spatial organization network of over 700 conserved mycobacterial proteins and reveal a coherent localization pattern for many proteins of known function, including those in translation, energy metabolism, cell growth and division, as well as proteins of unknown function. Furthermore, our pipeline exploits morphologic proxies to enable a pseudo-temporal approximation of protein localization and identifies previously uncharacterized cell-cycle-dependent dynamics of essential mycobacterial proteins. Collectively, these data provide a systems perspective on the subcellular organization of mycobacteria and provide tools for the analysis of bacteria with non-standard growth characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the undisputable role of the small GTPase Rac1 in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, the Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (Rac-GEFs) involved in Rac1-mediated motility and invasion in human lung adenocarcinoma cells remain largely unknown. Here, we identify FARP1, ARHGEF39, and TIAM2 as essential Rac-GEFs responsible for Rac1-mediated lung cancer cell migration upon EGFR and c-Met activation. Noteworthily, these Rac-GEFs operate in a non-redundant manner by controlling distinctive aspects of ruffle dynamics formation. Mechanistic analysis reveals a leading role of the AXL-Gab1-PI3K axis in conferring pro-motility traits downstream of EGFR. Along with the positive association between the overexpression of Rac-GEFs and poor lung adenocarcinoma patient survival, we show that FARP1 and ARHGEF39 are upregulated in EpCam+ cells sorted from primary human lung adenocarcinomas. Overall, our study reveals fundamental insights into the complex intricacies underlying Rac-GEF-mediated cancer cell motility signaling, hence underscoring promising targets for metastatic lung cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing of mRNA precursors is essential in the regulation of gene expression. U2AF65 recognizes the poly-pyrimidine tract and helps in the recognition of the branch point. Inactivation of fission yeast U2AF65 (Prp2) blocks splicing of most, but not all, pre-mRNAs, for reasons that are not understood. Here, we have determined genome-wide the splicing efficiency of fission yeast cells as they progress into synchronous meiosis in the presence or absence of functional Prp2. Our data indicate that in addition to the splicing elements at the 3′ end of any intron, the nucleotides immediately upstream the intron will determine whether Prp2 is required or dispensable for splicing. By changing those nucleotides in any given intron, we regulate its Prp2 dependency. Our results suggest a model in which Prp2 is required for the coordinated recognition of both intronic ends, placing Prp2 as a key regulatory element in the determination of the exon-intron boundaries.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic programming is intricately linked to the anti-tumor properties of T cells. To study the metabolic pathways associated with increased anti-tumor T cell function, we utilized a metabolomics approach to characterize three different CD8+ T cell subsets with varying degrees of anti-tumor activity in murine models, of which IL-22-producing Tc22 cells displayed the most robust anti-tumor activity. Tc22s demonstrated upregulation of the pantothenate/coenzyme A (CoA) pathway and a requirement for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for differentiation. Exogenous administration of CoA reprogrammed T cells to increase OXPHOS and adopt the CD8+ Tc22 phenotype independent of polarizing conditions via the transcription factors HIF-1α and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In murine tumor models, treatment of mice with the CoA precursor pantothenate enhanced the efficacy of anti-PDL1 antibody therapy. In patients with melanoma, pre-treatment plasma pantothenic acid levels were positively correlated with the response to anti-PD1 therapy. Collectively, our data demonstrate that pantothenate and its metabolite CoA drive T cell polarization, bioenergetics, and anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The acoel worm Hofstenia miamia, which can replace tissue lost to injury via differentiation of a population of stem cells, has emerged as a new research organism for studying regeneration. To enhance the depth of mechanistic studies in this system, we devised a protocol for microinjection into embryonic cells that resulted in stable transgene integration into the genome and generated animals with tissue-specific fluorescent transgene expression in epidermis, gut, and muscle. We demonstrate that transgenic Hofstenia are amenable to the isolation of specific cell types, investigations of regeneration, tracking of photoconverted molecules, and live imaging. Further, our stable transgenic lines revealed insights into the biology of Hofstenia, including a high-resolution three-dimensional view of cell morphology and the organization of muscle as a cellular scaffold for other tissues. Our work positions Hofstenia as a powerful system with multiple toolkits for mechanistic investigations of development, whole-body regeneration, and stem cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
Plasticity of cell mechanics underlies a wide range of cell and tissue behaviors allowing cells to migrate through narrow spaces, resist shear forces, and safeguard against mechanical damage. Such plasticity depends on spatiotemporal regulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but mechanisms of adaptive change in cell mechanics remain elusive. Here, we report a mechanism of mechanically activated actin polymerization at focal adhesions (FAs), specifically requiring the actin elongation factor mDia1. By combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modeling, we show that actin polymerization at FAs exhibits pulsatile dynamics where spikes of mDia1 activity are triggered by contractile forces. The suppression of mDia1-mediated actin polymerization increases tension on stress fibers (SFs) leading to an increased frequency of spontaneous SF damage and decreased efficiency of zyxin-mediated SF repair. We conclude that tension-controlled actin polymerization acts as a safety valve dampening excessive tension on the actin cytoskeleton and safeguarding SFs against mechanical damage.

Abstract: Summary
Conserved developmentally regulated guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (Drgs) and their binding partner Drg family regulatory proteins (Dfrps) are important for embryonic development, cellular growth control, differentiation, and proliferation. Here, we report that the yeast Drg1/Dfrp1 ortholog Rbg1/Tma46 facilitates translational initiation, elongation, and termination by suppressing prolonged ribosome pausing. Consistent with the genome-wide observations, deletion of Rbg1 exacerbates the growth defect resulting from translation stalling, and Rbg1 stabilizes mRNAs against no-go decay. Furthermore, we provide a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the 80S ribosome bound with Rbg1/Tma46 that reveals the molecular interactions responsible for Rbg1/Tma46 function. The Rbg1 subunit binds to the GTPase association center of the ribosome and the A-tRNA, and the N-terminal zinc finger domain of the Tma46 subunit binds to the 40S, establishing an interaction critical for the ribosomal association. Our results answer the fundamental question of how a paused ribosome resumes translation and show that Drg1/Dfrp1 play a critical role in ensuring orderly translation.

Abstract: Summary
The North American beaver is an exceptionally long-lived and cancer-resistant rodent species. Here, we report the evolutionary changes in its gene coding sequences, copy numbers, and expression. We identify changes that likely increase its ability to detoxify aldehydes, enhance tumor suppression and DNA repair, and alter lipid metabolism, potentially contributing to its longevity and cancer resistance. Hpgd, a tumor suppressor gene, is uniquely duplicated in beavers among rodents, and several genes associated with tumor suppression and longevity are under positive selection in beavers. Lipid metabolism genes show positive selection signals, changes in copy numbers, or altered gene expression in beavers. Aldh1a1, encoding an enzyme for aldehydes detoxification, is particularly notable due to its massive expansion in beavers, which enhances their cellular resistance to ethanol and capacity to metabolize diverse aldehyde substrates from lipid oxidation and their woody diet. We hypothesize that the amplification of Aldh1a1 may contribute to the longevity of beavers.

Abstract: Summary
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) encompasses a heterogenous group of tumors, but representative preclinical models are lacking. We previously showed that patient-derived tumorgraft (TG) models recapitulate the biology and treatment responsiveness. Through systematic orthotopic implantation of tumor samples from 926 ethnically diverse individuals into non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, we generate a resource comprising 172 independently derived, stably engrafted TG lines from 148 individuals. TG lines are characterized histologically and genomically (whole-exome [n = 97] and RNA [n = 102] sequencing). The platform features a variety of histological and oncogenotypes, including TCGA clades further corroborated through orthogonal metabolomic analyses. We illustrate how it enables a deeper understanding of RCC biology; enables the development of tissue- and imaging-based molecular probes; and supports advances in drug development.

Abstract: Summary
The ARID1A subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes is a potent tumor suppressor. Here, a degron is applied to detect rapid loss of chromatin accessibility at thousands of loci where ARID1A acts to generate accessible minidomains of nucleosomes. Loss of ARID1A also results in the redistribution of the coactivator EP300. Co-incident EP300 dissociation and lost chromatin accessibility at enhancer elements are highly enriched adjacent to rapidly downregulated genes. In contrast, sites of gained EP300 occupancy are linked to genes that are transcriptionally upregulated. These chromatin changes are associated with a small number of genes that are differentially expressed in the first hours following loss of ARID1A. Indirect or adaptive changes dominate the transcriptome following growth for days after loss of ARID1A and result in strong engagement with cancer pathways. The identification of this hierarchy suggests sites for intervention in ARID1A-driven diseases.

Abstract: Summary
PARP1 is a key player in the response to DNA damage and is the target of clinical inhibitors for the treatment of cancers. Binding of PARP1 to damaged DNA leads to activation wherein PARP1 uses NAD+ to add chains of poly(ADP-ribose) onto itself and other nuclear proteins. PARP1 also binds abundantly to intact DNA and chromatin, where it remains enzymatically inactive. We show that intact DNA makes contacts with the PARP1 BRCT domain, which was not previously recognized as a DNA-binding domain. This binding mode does not result in the concomitant reorganization and activation of the catalytic domain. We visualize the BRCT domain bound to nucleosomal DNA by cryogenic electron microscopy and identify a key motif conserved from ancestral BRCT domains for binding phosphates on DNA and phospho-peptides. Finally, we demonstrate that the DNA-binding properties of the BRCT domain contribute to the “monkey-bar mechanism” that mediates DNA transfer of PARP1.

Abstract: Summary
Cdc42 GTPase rules cell polarity and growth in fission yeast. It is negatively and positively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), respectively. Active Cdc42-GTP localizes to the poles, where it associates with numerous proteins constituting the polarity module. However, little is known about its downregulation. We describe here that oxidative stress causes Sty1-kinase-dependent Cdc42 inactivation at cell poles. Both the amount of active Cdc42 at tips and cell length inversely correlate with Sty1 activity, explaining the elongated morphology of Δsty1 cells. We have created stress-blinded cell poles either by eliminating two Cdc42 GAPs or through the constitutive tethering of Gef1 to cell tips, and we biochemically demonstrate that the GAPs Rga3/6 and the GEF Gef1 are direct substrates of Sty1. We propose that phosphorylation of Rga3/6 and Gef1 mediates the Sty1-dependent inhibition of Cdc42 at cell tips, halting polarized growth during stress adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
When a visual stimulus is repeated, average neuronal responses typically decrease, yet they might maintain or even increase their impact through increased synchronization. Previous work has found that many repetitions of a grating lead to increasing gamma-band synchronization. Here, we show in awake macaque area V1 that both repetition-related reductions in firing rate and increases in gamma are specific to the repeated stimulus. These effects show some persistence on the timescale of minutes. Gamma increases are specific to the presented stimulus location. Further, repetition effects on gamma and on firing rates generalize to images of natural objects. These findings support the notion that gamma-band synchronization subserves the adaptive processing of repeated stimulus encounters.

Abstract: Summary
Maximizing the personal, public, research, and clinical value of genomic information will require the reliable exchange of genetic variation data. We report here the Variation Representation Specification (VRS, pronounced “verse”), an extensible framework for the computable representation of variation that complements contemporary human-readable and flat file standards for genomic variation representation. VRS provides semantically precise representations of variation and leverages this design to enable federated identification of biomolecular variation with globally consistent and unique computed identifiers. The VRS framework includes a terminology and information model, machine-readable schema, data sharing conventions, and a reference implementation, each of which is intended to be broadly useful and freely available for community use. VRS was developed by a partnership among national information resource providers, public initiatives, and diagnostic testing laboratories under the auspices of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).

Abstract: Summary
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) critically regulate host-microbe interactions in the gastrointestinal tract, but their role in the airway remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoid-tissue-inducer (LTi)-like ILC3s are enriched in the lung-draining lymph nodes of healthy mice and humans. These ILC3s abundantly express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and functionally restrict the expansion of allergen-specific CD4+ T cells upon experimental airway challenge. In a mouse model of house-dust-mite-induced allergic airway inflammation, MHC class II+ ILC3s limit T helper type 2 (Th2) cell responses, eosinophilia, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, MHC class II+ ILC3s limit a concomitant Th17 cell response and airway neutrophilia. This exacerbated Th17 cell response requires exposure of the lung to microbial stimuli, which can be found associated with house dust mites. These findings demonstrate a critical role for antigen-presenting ILC3s in orchestrating immune tolerance in the airway by restricting pro-inflammatory T cell responses to both allergens and microbes.

Abstract: In angiosperms the reproductive transition results in the transformation of a vegetative apical meristem (SAM) into an inflorescence meristem (IM), capable of forming floral meristems (FM). Two key players in the flowering transition are AGAMOUS-like 24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). They are eudicot MADS-box paralogs performing opposite roles, as AGL24 positively regulates flowering while SVP represses the reproductive transition in Arabidopsis. We confirm that the Arabidopsis functional reference cannot be readily extrapolated to all eudicots as there are additional duplications of AGL24 in early divergent eudicots and core eudicots with significant sequence variation. In addition, we found that in monocots, two additional independent duplication events have resulted in at least three clades of AGL24/SVP homologs, some only found in Orchidaceae. Protein sequence analyses and comparative evolutionary rates point to higher rates of relaxed negative selection in the Core Eudicot AGL24 B and the Orch SVP-like B clades, in eudicots and monocots respectively. On the other hand, expression data points to plesiomorphic pleiotropic roles of AGL24/SVP genes likely similar to SVP core eudicot genes, and the acquisition of new roles as flowering positive regulators in Core Eudicot AGL24 A genes. Our research presents evidence on the diversification and recruitment of AGL24/SVP homologs in flowering transition in orchids. Although, broad expression of most copies does not allow to determine if they act as flowering repressors or promoters, the restricted expression of some homologs in the SAM suggests putative roles in maintaining the vegetative phase. If so studying in detail the function of AGL24/SVP homologs in orchids is critical to identify putative flowering repressors in a lineage where other canonical repressors remain elusive.

Abstract: Summary
Autotaxin (ATX; ENPP2) produces lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that regulates multiple biological functions via cognate G protein-coupled receptors LPAR1-6. ATX/LPA promotes tumor cell migration and metastasis via LPAR1 and T cell motility via LPAR2, yet its actions in the tumor immune microenvironment remain unclear. Here, we show that ATX secreted by melanoma cells is chemorepulsive for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and circulating CD8+ T cells ex vivo, with ATX functioning as an LPA-producing chaperone. Mechanistically, T cell repulsion predominantly involves Gα12/13-coupled LPAR6. Upon anti-cancer vaccination of tumor-bearing mice, ATX does not affect the induction of systemic T cell responses but, importantly, suppresses tumor infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and thereby impairs tumor regression. Moreover, single-cell data from melanoma tumors are consistent with intratumoral ATX acting as a T cell repellent. These findings highlight an unexpected role for the pro-metastatic ATX-LPAR axis in suppressing CD8+ T cell infiltration to impede anti-tumor immunity, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly and disassembly of DNA repair protein complexes at DNA damage sites are essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Investigating factors coordinating assembly of the base excision repair (BER) proteins DNA polymerase β (Polβ) and XRCC1 to DNA lesion sites identifies a role for Polβ in regulating XRCC1 disassembly from DNA repair complexes and, conversely, demonstrates Polβ’s dependence on XRCC1 for complex assembly. LivePAR, a genetically encoded probe for live-cell imaging of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), reveals that Polβ and XRCC1 require PAR for repair-complex assembly, with PARP1 and PARP2 playing unique roles in complex dynamics. Further, BER complex assembly is modulated by attenuation/augmentation of NAD+ biosynthesis. Finally, SIRT6 does not modulate PARP1 or PARP2 activation but does regulate XRCC1 recruitment, leading to diminished Polβ abundance at sites of DNA damage. These findings highlight coordinated yet independent roles for PARP1, PARP2, and SIRT6 and their regulation by NAD+ bioavailability to facilitate BER.

Abstract: Summary
The role of chromatin-associated RNAi components in the nucleus of mammalian cells and in particular in the context of developmental programs remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigate the function of nuclear Argonaute 1 (Ago1) in gene expression regulation during skeletal muscle differentiation. We show that Ago1 is required for activation of the myogenic program by supporting chromatin modification mediated by developmental enhancer activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Ago1 directly controls global H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) by regulating enhancer RNA (eRNA)-CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetyltransferase interaction, a key step in enhancer-driven gene activation. In particular, we show that Ago1 is specifically required for myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) and downstream myogenic gene activation, whereas its depletion leads to failure of CBP acetyltransferase activation and blocking of the myogenic program. Our work establishes a role of the mammalian enhancer-associated RNAi component Ago1 in epigenome regulation and activation of developmental programs.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting mitochondrial metabolism has emerged as a treatment option for cancer patients. The ABL tyrosine kinases promote metastasis, and enhanced ABL signaling is associated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Here we show that ABL kinase allosteric inhibitors impair mitochondrial integrity and decrease oxidative phosphorylation. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities that enhance this phenotype, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screen and identified HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and target of statin therapies, as a top-scoring sensitizer to ABL inhibition. Combination treatment with ABL allosteric inhibitors and statins decreases metastatic lung cancer cell survival in vitro in a synergistic manner. Notably, combination therapy in mouse models of lung cancer brain metastasis and therapy resistance impairs metastatic colonization with a concomitant increase in animal survival. Thus, metabolic combination therapy might be effective to decrease metastatic outgrowth, leading to increased survival for lung cancer patients with advanced disease.

Abstract: Summary
As tissue macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia constitute the pivotal immune cells of this organ. Microglial features are strongly dependent on environmental cues such as commensal microbiota. Gut bacteria are known to continuously modulate microglia maturation and function by the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the precise mechanism of this crosstalk is unknown. Here we determined that the immature phenotype of microglia from germ-free (GF) mice is epigenetically imprinted by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac on metabolic genes associated with substantial functional alterations including increased mitochondrial mass and specific respiratory chain dysfunctions. We identified acetate as the essential microbiome-derived SCFA driving microglia maturation and regulating the homeostatic metabolic state, and further showed that it is able to modulate microglial phagocytosis and disease progression during neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that acetate is an essential bacteria-derived molecule driving metabolic pathways and functions of microglia during health and perturbation.

Abstract: Summary
To elucidate mechanisms by which T cells eliminate leukemia, we study donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), an established immunotherapy for relapsed leukemia. We model T cell dynamics by integrating longitudinal, multimodal data from 94,517 bone marrow-derived single T cell transcriptomes in addition to chromatin accessibility and single T cell receptor sequencing from patients undergoing DLI. We find that responsive tumors are defined by enrichment of late-differentiated T cells before DLI and rapid, durable expansion of early differentiated T cells after treatment, highly similar to “terminal” and “precursor” exhausted subsets, respectively. Resistance, in contrast, is defined by heterogeneous T cell dysfunction. Surprisingly, early differentiated T cells in responders mainly originate from pre-existing and novel clonotypes recruited to the leukemic microenvironment, rather than the infusion. Our work provides a paradigm for analyzing longitudinal single-cell profiling of scenarios beyond adoptive cell therapy and introduces Symphony, a Bayesian approach to infer regulatory circuitry underlying T cell subsets, with broad relevance to exhaustion antagonists across cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The integration of transcriptomic and neuroimaging data, “imaging transcriptomics,” has recently emerged to generate hypotheses about potential biological pathways underlying regional variability in neuroimaging features. However, the validity of this approach is yet to be examined in depth. Here, we sought to bridge this gap by performing transcriptomic decoding of the regional distribution of well-known molecular markers spanning different elements of the biology of the healthy human brain. Imaging transcriptomics identifies biological and cell pathways that are consistent with the known biology of a wide range of molecular neuroimaging markers. The extent to which it can capture patterns of gene expression that align well with elements of the biology of the neuroinflammatory axis, at least in healthy controls without a proinflammatory challenge, is inconclusive. Imaging transcriptomics might constitute an interesting approach to improve our understanding of the biological pathways underlying regional variability in a wide range of neuroimaging phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated inflammation dominated by chemokine expression is a key feature of disease following infection with the globally important human pathogens Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus, but a mechanistic understanding of how pro-inflammatory responses are initiated is lacking. Mitophagy is a quality-control mechanism that regulates innate immune signaling and cytokine production through selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) antagonizes mitophagy by binding to the host protein Ajuba and preventing its translocation to depolarized mitochondria where it is required for PINK1 activation and downstream signaling. Consequent mitophagy suppression amplifies the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines through protein kinase R (PKR) sensing of mitochondrial RNA. In Ajuba−/− mice, ZIKV induces early expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines associated with significantly enhanced dissemination to tissues. This work identifies Ajuba as a critical regulator of mitophagy and demonstrates a role for mitophagy in limiting systemic inflammation following infection by globally important human viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Human neuroimaging studies have shown that, during cognitive processing, the brain undergoes dynamic transitions between multiple, frequency-tuned states of activity. Although different states may emerge from distinct sources of neural activity, it remains unclear whether single-area neuronal spiking can also drive multiple dynamic states. In mice, we ask whether frequency modulation of the entorhinal cortex activity causes dynamic states to emerge and whether these states respond to distinct stimulation frequencies. Using hidden Markov modeling, we perform unsupervised detection of transient states in mouse brain-wide fMRI fluctuations induced via optogenetic frequency modulation of excitatory neurons. We unveil the existence of multiple, frequency-dependent dynamic states, invisible through standard static fMRI analyses. These states are linked to different anatomical circuits and disrupted in a frequency-dependent fashion in a transgenic model of cognitive disease directly related to entorhinal cortex dysfunction. These findings provide cross-scale insight into basic neuronal mechanisms that may underpin flexibility in brain-wide dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic TORC1 kinase assimilates diverse environmental cues, including growth factors and nutrients, to control growth by tuning anabolic and catabolic processes. In yeast, TORC1 stimulates protein synthesis in response to abundant nutrients primarily through its proximal effector kinase Sch9. Conversely, TORC1 inhibition following nutrient limitation unlocks various distally controlled kinases (e.g., Atg1, Gcn2, Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1), which cooperate through poorly defined circuits to orchestrate the quiescence program. To better define the signaling landscape of the latter kinases, we use in vivo quantitative phosphoproteomics. Through pinpointing known and uncharted Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1 effectors, our study examines the architecture of the distally controlled TORC1 kinase network. Accordingly, this is built on a combination of discrete, convergent, and multilayered feedback regulatory mechanisms, which likely ensure homeostatic control of and/or robust responses by TORC1 and its effector kinases under fluctuating nutritional conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal lacteals are essential lymphatic channels for absorption and transport of dietary lipids and drive the pathogenesis of debilitating metabolic diseases. However, organ-specific mechanisms linking lymphatic dysfunction to disease etiology remain largely unknown. In this study, we uncover an intestinal lymphatic program that is linked to the left-right (LR) asymmetric transcription factor Pitx2. We show that deletion of the asymmetric Pitx2 enhancer ASE alters normal lacteal development through the lacteal-associated contractile smooth muscle lineage. ASE deletion leads to abnormal muscle morphogenesis induced by oxidative stress, resulting in impaired lacteal extension and defective lymphatic system-dependent lipid transport. Surprisingly, activation of lymphatic system-independent trafficking directs dietary lipids from the gut directly to the liver, causing diet-induced fatty liver disease. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism linking gut lymphatic function to the earliest symmetry-breaking Pitx2 and highlights the important relationship between intestinal lymphangiogenesis and the gut-liver axis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are key organelles for cellular energetics, metabolism, signaling, and quality control and have been linked to various diseases. Different views exist on the composition of the human mitochondrial proteome. We classified >8,000 proteins in mitochondrial preparations of human cells and defined a mitochondrial high-confidence proteome of >1,100 proteins (MitoCoP). We identified interactors of translocases, respiratory chain, and ATP synthase assembly factors. The abundance of MitoCoP proteins covers six orders of magnitude and amounts to 7% of the cellular proteome with the chaperones HSP60-HSP10 being the most abundant mitochondrial proteins. MitoCoP dynamics spans three orders of magnitudes, with half-lives from hours to months, and suggests a rapid regulation of biosynthesis and assembly processes. 460 MitoCoP genes are linked to human diseases with a strong prevalence for the central nervous system and metabolism. MitoCoP will provide a high-confidence resource for placing dynamics, functions, and dysfunctions of mitochondria into the cellular context.

Abstract: Summary
We report that atypical protein kinase Cι (PKCι) is an oncogenic driver of glioblastoma (GBM). Deletion or inhibition of PKCι significantly impairs tumor growth and prolongs survival in murine GBM models. GBM cells expressing elevated PKCι signaling are sensitive to PKCι inhibitors, whereas those expressing low PKCι signaling exhibit active SRC signaling and sensitivity to SRC inhibitors. Resistance to the PKCι inhibitor auranofin is associated with activated SRC signaling and response to a SRC inhibitor, whereas resistance to a SRC inhibitor is associated with activated PKCι signaling and sensitivity to auranofin. Interestingly, PKCι- and SRC-dependent cells often co-exist in individual GBM tumors, and treatment of GBM-bearing mice with combined auranofin and SRC inhibitor prolongs survival beyond either drug alone. Thus, we identify PKCι and SRC signaling as distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities that are directly translatable into an improved treatment for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
The basal ganglia (BG) are a group of subcortical nuclei responsible for motor and executive function. Central to BG function are striatal cells expressing D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) dopamine receptors. D1R and D2R cells are considered functional antagonists that facilitate voluntary movements and inhibit competing motor patterns, respectively. However, whether they maintain a uniform function across the striatum and what influence they exert outside the BG is unclear. Here, we address these questions by combining optogenetic activation of D1R and D2R cells in the mouse ventrolateral caudoputamen with fMRI. Striatal D1R/D2R stimulation evokes distinct activity within the BG-thalamocortical network and differentially engages cerebellar and prefrontal regions. Computational modeling of effective connectivity confirms that changes in D1R/D2R output drive functional relationships between these regions. Our results suggest a complex functional organization of striatal D1R/D2R cells and hint toward an interconnected fronto-BG-cerebellar network modulated by striatal D1R and D2R cells.

Abstract: Summary
Liver-resident macrophages Kupffer cells (KCs) and infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes both contribute to liver tissue regeneration in various pathologies but also to disease progression upon disruption of orderly consecutive regeneration cascades. Little is known about molecular pathways that regulate their differentiation, maintenance, or inflammatory behavior during injury. Here, we show that copper metabolism MURR1 domain (COMMD)10-deficient KCs adopt liver-specific identity. Strikingly, COMMD10 deficiency in KCs and in other tissue-resident macrophages impedes their homeostatic survival, leading to their continuous replacement by Ly6Chi monocytes. While COMMD10 deficiency in KCs mildly worsens acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI), its deficiency in Ly6Chi monocytes results in exacerbated and sustained hepatic damage. Monocytes display unleashed inflammasome activation and a reduced type I interferon response and acquire “neutrophil-like” and lipid-associated macrophage differentiation fates. Collectively, COMMD10 appears indispensable for KC and other tissue-resident macrophage survival and is an important regulator of Ly6Chi monocyte fate decisions and reparative behavior in the diseased liver.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-DNA hybrids are often associated with genome instability and also function as a cellular regulator in many biological processes. In this study, we show that accumulated RNA-DNA hybrids cause multiple defects in budding yeast meiosis, including decreased sporulation efficiency and spore viability. Further analysis shows that these RNA-DNA hybrid foci colocalize with RPA/Rad51 foci on chromosomes. The efficient formation of RNA-DNA hybrid foci depends on Rad52 and ssDNA ends of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and their number is correlated with DSB frequency. Interestingly, RNA-DNA hybrid foci and recombination foci show similar dynamics. The excessive accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids around DSBs competes with Rad51/Dmc1, impairs homolog bias, and decreases crossover and noncrossover recombination. Furthermore, precocious removal of RNA-DNA hybrids by RNase H1 overexpression also impairs meiotic recombination similarly. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RNA-DNA hybrids form at ssDNA ends of DSBs to actively regulate meiotic recombination.

Abstract: Summary
As cells enter mitosis, chromatin compacts to facilitate chromosome segregation yet remains transcribed. Transcription supercoils DNA to levels that can impede further progression of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) unless it is removed by DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). Using ChIP-seq on mitotic cells, we found that TOP1 is required for RNAPII translocation along genes. The stimulation of TOP1 activity by RNAPII during elongation allowed RNAPII clearance from genes in prometaphase and enabled chromosomal segregation. Disruption of the TOP1-RNAPII interaction impaired RNAPII spiking at promoters and triggered defects in the post-mitotic transcription program. This program includes factors necessary for cell growth, and cells with impaired TOP1-RNAPII interaction are more sensitive to inhibitors of mTOR signaling. We conclude that TOP1 is necessary for assisting transcription during mitosis with consequences for growth and gene expression long after mitosis is completed. In this sense, TOP1 ensures that cellular memory is preserved in subsequent generations.

Abstract: Summary
Hexokinases (HK) catalyze the first step of glycolysis limiting its pace. HK2 is highly expressed in gut epithelium, contributes to immune responses, and is upregulated during inflammation. We examined the microbial regulation of HK2 and its impact on inflammation using mice lacking HK2 in intestinal epithelial cells (Hk2ΔIEC). Hk2ΔIEC mice were less susceptible to acute colitis. Analyzing the epithelial transcriptome from Hk2ΔIEC mice during colitis and using HK2-deficient intestinal organoids and Caco-2 cells revealed reduced mitochondrial respiration and epithelial cell death in the absence of HK2. The microbiota strongly regulated HK2 expression and activity. The microbially derived short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate repressed HK2 expression via histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) and reduced mitochondrial respiration in wild-type but not in HK2-deficient Caco-2 cells. Butyrate supplementation protected wild-type but not Hk2ΔIEC mice from colitis. Our findings define a mechanism how butyrate promotes intestinal homeostasis and suggest targeted HK2-inhibition as therapeutic avenue for inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant cell transformation and the underlying reprogramming of gene expression require the cooperation of multiple oncogenic mutations. This cooperation is reflected in the synergistic regulation of non-mutant downstream genes, so-called cooperation response genes (CRGs). CRGs affect diverse hallmark features of cancer cells and are not known to be functionally connected. However, they act as critical mediators of the cancer phenotype at an unexpectedly high frequency >50%, as indicated by genetic perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that CRGs function within a network of strong genetic interdependencies that are critical to the malignant state. Our network modeling methodology, TopNet, takes the approach of incorporating uncertainty in the underlying gene perturbation data and can identify non-linear gene interactions. In the dense space of gene connectivity, TopNet reveals a sparse topological gene network architecture, effectively pinpointing functionally relevant gene interactions. Thus, among diverse potential applications, TopNet has utility for identification of non-mutant targets for cancer intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor clustering is the first and critical step to activate apoptosis by death receptor-5 (DR5). The recent discovery of the autoinhibitory DR5 ectodomain has challenged the long-standing view of its mechanistic activation by the natural ligand Apo2L. Because the autoinhibitory residues have remained unknown, here we characterize a crucial patch of positively charged residues (PPCR) in the highly variable domain of DR5. The PPCR electrostatically separates DR5 receptors to autoinhibit their clustering in the absence of ligand and antibody binding. Mutational substitution and antibody-mediated PPCR interference resulted in increased apoptotic cytotoxic function. A dually specific antibody that enables sustained tampering with PPCR function exceptionally enhanced DR5 clustering and apoptotic activation and distinctively improved the survival of animals bearing aggressive metastatic and recurrent tumors, whereas clinically tested DR5 antibodies without PPCR blockade function were largely ineffective. Our study provides mechanistic insights into DR5 activation and a therapeutic analytical design for potential clinical success.

Abstract: Summary
Precise heading perception requires integration of optic flow and vestibular cues, yet the two cues often carry distinct temporal dynamics that may confound cue integration benefit. Here, we varied temporal offset between the two sensory inputs while macaques discriminated headings around straight ahead. We find the best heading performance does not occur under natural condition of synchronous inputs with zero offset but rather when visual stimuli are artificially adjusted to lead vestibular by a few hundreds of milliseconds. This amount exactly matches the lag between the vestibular acceleration and visual speed signals as measured from single-unit-activity in frontal and posterior parietal cortices. Manually aligning cues in these areas best facilitates integration with some nonlinear gain modulation effects. These findings are consistent with predictions from a model by which the brain integrates optic flow speed with a faster vestibular acceleration signal for sensing instantaneous heading direction during self-motion in the environment.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly and homologous recombination, the most critical events during prophase I, are the prerequisite for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that a functional RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, DESYNAPSIS1 (DSNP1), plays significant roles in SC assembly and homologous recombination during rice meiosis. In the dsnp1 mutant, homologous synapsis is discontinuous and aberrant SC-like polycomplexes occur independent of coaligned homologous chromosomes. Accompanying the decreased foci of HEI10, ZIP4, and MER3 on meiotic chromosomes, the number of crossovers (COs) decreases dramatically in dsnp1 meiocytes. Furthermore, the absence of central elements largely restores the localization of non-ZEP1 ZMM proteins and the number of COs in the dsnp1 background. Collectively, DSNP1 stabilizes the canonical tripartite SC structure along paired homologous chromosomes and further promotes the formation of COs.

Abstract: Summary
This study addresses the roles of nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2) in prostate cancer (PC) progression in response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Reduced NCOR2 expression significantly associates with shorter disease-free survival in patients with PC receiving adjuvant ADT. Utilizing the CWR22 xenograft model, we demonstrate that stably reduced NCOR2 expression accelerates disease recurrence following ADT, associates with gene expression patterns that include neuroendocrine features, and induces DNA hypermethylation. Stably reduced NCOR2 expression in isogenic LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and LNCaP-C4-2 (androgen-independent) cells revealed that NCOR2 reduction phenocopies the impact of androgen treatment and induces global DNA hypermethylation patterns. NCOR2 genomic binding is greatest in LNCaP-C4-2 cells and most clearly associates with forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXA1 binding. NCOR2 binding significantly associates with transcriptional regulation most when in active enhancer regions. These studies reveal robust roles for NCOR2 in regulating the PC transcriptome and epigenome and underscore recent mutational studies linking NCOR2 loss of function to PC disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Cooperation is common in nature and is pivotal to the development of human society. However, the details of how and why cooperation evolved remain poorly understood. Cross-species investigation of cooperation may help to elucidate the evolution of cooperative strategies. Thus, we design an automated cooperative behavioral paradigm and quantitatively examine the cooperative abilities and strategies of mice, rats, and tree shrews. We find that social communication plays a key role in the establishment of cooperation and that increased cooperative ability and a more efficient cooperative strategy emerge as a function of the evolutionary hierarchy of the tested species. Moreover, we demonstrate that single-unit activities in the orbitofrontal and prelimbic cortex in rats represent neural signals that may be used to distinguish between the cooperative and non-cooperative tasks, and such signals are distinct from the reward signals. Both signals may represent distinct components of the internal drive for cooperation.

Abstract: Summary
Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) stabilizes synaptic transmission by counteracting impaired neurotransmitter receptor function through neurotransmitter release potentiation. PHP is thought to be triggered by impaired receptor function and to involve a stereotypic signaling pathway. However, here we demonstrate that different receptor perturbations that similarly reduce synaptic transmission result in different responses at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. While receptor inhibition by the glutamate receptor (GluR) antagonist γ-D-glutamylglycine (γDGG) is not compensated by PHP, the GluR inhibitors Philanthotoxin-433 (PhTx) and Gyki-53655 (Gyki) induce compensatory PHP. Intriguingly, PHP triggered by PhTx and Gyki involve separable signaling pathways, including inhibition of distinct GluR subtypes, differential modulation of the active-zone scaffold Bruchpilot, and short-term plasticity. Moreover, while PHP upon Gyki treatment does not require genes promoting PhTx-induced PHP, it involves presynaptic protein kinase D. Thus, synapses not only respond differentially to similar activity impairments, but achieve homeostatic compensation via distinct mechanisms, highlighting the diversity of homeostatic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), a Ca2+-permeable cation channel, is gated by intracellular adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR), Ca2+, warm temperature, and oxidative stress. It is critically involved in physiological and pathological processes ranging from inflammation to stroke to neurodegeneration. At present, the channel’s gating and ion permeation mechanisms, such as the location and identity of the selectivity filter, remain ambiguous. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human TRPM2 in nanodisc in the ligand-free state. Cryo-EM map-guided computational modeling and patch-clamp recording further identify a quadruple-residue motif as the ion selectivity filter, which adopts a restrictive conformation in the closed state and acts as a gate, profoundly contrasting with its widely open conformation in the Nematostella vectensis TRPM2. Our study reveals the gating of human TRPM2 by the filter and demonstrates the feasibility of using cryo-EM in conjunction with computational modeling and functional studies to garner structural information for intrinsically dynamic but functionally important domains.

Abstract: Summary
Union of two gametes to form a zygote is a defining event in the life of sexual eukaryotes, yet the mechanisms that underlie cell-cell fusion during fertilization remain poorly characterized. Here, in studies of fertilization in the green alga, Chlamydomonas, we report identification of a membrane protein on minus gametes, Minus Adhesion Receptor 1 (MAR1), that is essential for the membrane attachment with plus gametes that immediately precedes lipid bilayer merger. We show that MAR1 forms a receptor pair with previously identified receptor FUS1 on plus gametes, whose ectodomain architecture we find is identical to a sperm adhesion protein conserved throughout plant lineages. Strikingly, before fusion, MAR1 is biochemically and functionally associated with the ancient, evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic Class II fusion protein HAP2 on minus gametes. Thus, the integral membrane protein MAR1 provides a molecular link between membrane adhesion and bilayer merger during fertilization in Chlamydomonas.

Abstract: Summary
Failure to reorganize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mitosis results in chromosome missegregation. Here, we show that accurate chromosome segregation in human cells requires cell cycle-regulated ER membrane production. Excess ER membranes increase the viscosity of the mitotic cytoplasm to physically restrict chromosome movements, which impedes the correction of mitotic errors leading to the formation of micronuclei. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the protein phosphatase CTDNEP1 counteracts mTOR kinase to establish a dephosphorylated pool of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin 1 in interphase. CTDNEP1 control of lipin 1 limits the synthesis of fatty acids for ER membrane biogenesis in interphase that then protects against chromosome missegregation in mitosis. Thus, regulation of ER size can dictate the biophysical properties of mitotic cells, providing an explanation for why ER reorganization is necessary for mitotic fidelity. Our data further suggest that dysregulated lipid metabolism is a potential source of aneuploidy in cancer cells.

Abstract: Apart from the fact that miR-552-3p is known to promote cell progression among various cancers, its function on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown which therefore emerges as the purpose of this research. TargetScan, Starbase, miRWalk, miRDB and the Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) were utilized to analyze the target genes of miR-552-3p. NSCLC cells were transfected with miR-552-3p mimic, miR-552-3p inhibitor, Fibulin 5 (FBLN5) overexpression plasmid, and small interfering FBLN5 (siFBLN5) and treated with extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway inhibitor PD98059. MiR-552-3p, FBLN5, p-ERK, ERK, p-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and β-catenin levels were detected through quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The binding sites between miR-552-3p and FBLN5 were predicted by TargetScan, which was tested through dual luciferase reporter analysis. Cell viability, migration and invasion were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. MiR-552-3p expression was upregulated in NSCLC and FBLN5 functioned as its target. MiR-552-3p mimic promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, p-ERK, p-GSK3β and β-catenin expressions in NSCLC cells while miR-552-3p inhibitor did the opposite. Overexpressed FBLN5 suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion, p-ERK, p-GSK3β and β-catenin expressions in NSCLC cells whereas siFBLN5 exerted the effects opposite to overexpressed FBLN5. PD98059 enhanced the effect of overexpressed FBLN5 on NSCLC cell migration and invasion while reversing the effect of siFBLN5. MiR-552-3p facilitated cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC through sponging FBLN5 via activation of ERK/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue damage induces immediate-early signals, activating Rho small GTPases to trigger actin polymerization essential for later wound repair. However, how tissue damage is sensed to activate Rho small GTPases locally remains elusive. Here, we found that wounding the C. elegans epidermis induces rapid relocalization of CDC-42 into plasma membrane-associated clusters, which subsequently recruits WASP/WSP-1 to trigger actin polymerization to close the wound. In addition, wounding induces a local transient increase and subsequent reduction of H2O2, which negatively regulates the clustering of CDC-42 and wound closure. CDC-42 CAAX motif-mediated prenylation and polybasic region-mediated cation-phospholipid interaction are both required for its clustering. Cysteine residues participate in intermolecular disulfide bonds to reduce membrane association and are required for negative regulation of CDC-42 clustering by H2O2. Collectively, our findings suggest that H2O2-regulated fine-tuning of CDC-42 localization can create a distinct biomolecular cluster that facilitates rapid epithelial wound repair after injury.

Abstract: Summary
fMRI studies have shown that pairing a task-irrelevant visual feature with electrical micro-stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-EM) is sufficient to increase the sensory cortical representation of the paired feature and to improve perceptual performance. However, since fMRI provides an indirect measure of neural activity, the neural response changes underlying the fMRI activations are unknown. Here, we pair a task-irrelevant grating orientation with VTA-EM while attention is directed to a difficult orthogonal task. We examine the changes in neural response properties in macaques by recording spiking activity in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, the locus of fMRI-defined plasticity in previous studies. We observe a relative increase in mean spike rate and preference for the VTA-EM paired orientation compared to an unpaired orientation, which is unrelated to attention. These results demonstrate that VTA-EM-stimulus pairing is sufficient to induce sensory cortical plasticity at the spiking level in nonhuman primates.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells have a remarkable potential to differentiate into diverse effector lineages following activation. Here, we probe the heterogeneity present among naive CD4+ T cells before encountering their cognate antigen to ask whether their effector potential is modulated by pre-existing transcriptional and chromatin landscape differences. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that key drivers of variability are genes involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Using CD5 expression as a readout of the strength of tonic TCR interactions with self-peptide MHC, and sorting on the ends of this self-reactivity spectrum, we find that pre-existing transcriptional differences among naive CD4+ T cells impact follicular helper T (TFH) cell versus non-TFH effector lineage choice. Moreover, our data implicate TCR signal strength during thymic development in establishing differences in naive CD4+ T cell chromatin landscapes that ultimately shape their effector potential.

Abstract: Summary
The need for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) next-generation vaccines has been highlighted by the rise of variants of concern (VoCs) and the long-term threat of emerging coronaviruses. Here, we design and characterize four categories of engineered nanoparticle immunogens that recapitulate the structural and antigenic properties of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), S1, and receptor-binding domain (RBD). These immunogens induce robust S binding, ACE2 inhibition, and authentic and pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A spike-ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine elicits neutralizing titers (ID50 > 10,000) following a single immunization, whereas RBD-ferritin nanoparticle (RFN) immunogens elicit similar responses after two immunizations and also show durable and potent neutralization against circulating VoCs. Passive transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from SpFN- or RFN-immunized mice protects K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Furthermore, S-domain nanoparticle immunization elicits ACE2-blocking activity and ID50 neutralizing antibody titers >2,000 against SARS-CoV-1, highlighting the broad response elicited by these immunogens.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingomyelin (SM) is a mammalian lipid mainly distributed in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). We show that peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2), a member of the fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP) family, can localize at the PM and controls the transbilayer distribution of SM. Genetic screening with genome-wide small hairpin RNA libraries identifies PMP2 as a protein involved in the transbilayer movement of SM. A biochemical assay demonstrates that PMP2 is a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-binding protein. PMP2 induces the tubulation of model membranes in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner, accompanied by the modification of the transbilayer membrane distribution of lipids. In the PM of PMP2-overexpressing cells, inner-leaflet SM is increased whereas outer-leaflet SM is reduced. PMP2 is a causative protein of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). A mutation in PMP2 associated with CMT increases its affinity for PI(4,5)P2, inducing membrane tubulation and the subsequent transbilayer movement of lipids.

Abstract: Summary
To reshape neuronal connectivity in adult stages, Drosophila sensory neurons prune their dendrites during metamorphosis using a genetic degeneration program that is induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Metamorphosis is a nonfeeding stage that imposes metabolic constraints on development. We find that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a regulator of energy homeostasis, is cell-autonomously required for dendrite pruning. AMPK is activated by ecdysone and promotes oxidative phosphorylation and pyruvate usage, likely to enable neurons to use noncarbohydrate metabolites such as amino acids for energy production. Loss of AMPK or mitochondrial deficiency causes specific defects in pruning factor translation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings distinguish pruning from pathological neurite degeneration, which is often induced by defects in energy production, and highlight how metabolism is adapted to fit energy-costly developmental transitions.

Abstract: Summary
The characteristics of the sleep drivers and the mechanisms through which sleep relieves the cellular homeostatic pressure are unclear. In flies, zebrafish, mice, and humans, DNA damage levels increase during wakefulness and decrease during sleep. Here, we show that 6 h of consolidated sleep is sufficient to reduce DNA damage in the zebrafish dorsal pallium. Induction of DNA damage by neuronal activity and mutagens triggered sleep and DNA repair. The activity of the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins Rad52 and Ku80 increased during sleep, and chromosome dynamics enhanced Rad52 activity. The activity of the DDR initiator poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) increased following sleep deprivation. In both larva zebrafish and adult mice, Parp1 promoted sleep. Inhibition of Parp1 activity reduced sleep-dependent chromosome dynamics and repair. These results demonstrate that DNA damage is a homeostatic driver for sleep, and Parp1 pathways can sense this cellular pressure and facilitate sleep and repair activity.

Abstract: Summary
Biosynthesis scales with cell size such that protein concentrations generally remain constant as cells grow. As an exception, synthesis of the cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5 “sub-scales” with cell size so that its concentration is lower in larger cells to promote cell-cycle entry. Here, we find that transcriptional control uncouples Whi5 synthesis from cell size, and we identify histones as the major class of sub-scaling transcripts besides WHI5 by screening for similar genes. Histone synthesis is thereby matched to genome content rather than cell size. Such sub-scaling proteins are challenged by asymmetric cell division because proteins are typically partitioned in proportion to newborn cell volume. To avoid this fate, Whi5 uses chromatin-binding to partition similar protein amounts to each newborn cell regardless of cell size. Disrupting both Whi5 synthesis and chromatin-based partitioning weakens G1 size control. Thus, specific transcriptional and partitioning mechanisms determine protein sub-scaling to control cell size.

Visas are issued by data stewards, including data access committees (DACs) working with public databases, the entities responsible for the quality, integrity, and access arrangements for the datasets in the management of human biomedical data. Passports streamline management of data access rights across data systems by using visas that present a data user’s digital identity and permissions across organizations, tools, environments, and services. We describe real-world implementations of the GA4GH Passport standard in use cases from ELIXIR Europe, National Institutes of Health, and the Autism Sharing Initiative. These implementations demonstrate that the Passport standard has provided transparent mechanisms for establishing permissions and authorizing data access across platforms.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway required for multiple physiological functions including cell motility. SOCE is triggered in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores following the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor STIM1, which recruits the plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ channel Orai1 at ER-PM junctions. STIM1 is phosphorylated dynamically, and this phosphorylation has been implicated in several processes including SOCE inactivation during M-phase, maximal SOCE activation, ER segregation during mitosis, and cell migration. Human STIM1 has 10 Ser/Thr residues in its cytosolic domain that match the ERK/CDK consensus phosphorylation. We recently generated a mouse knock-in line where wild-type STIM1 was replaced by a non-phosphorylatable STIM1 with all ten S/Ts mutated to Ala (STIM1–10A). Here, we generate mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from the STIM1–10A mouse line and a control MEF line (WT) that express wild-type STIM1 from a congenic mouse strain. These lines offer a unique model to address the role of STIM1 phosphorylation at endogenous expression levels in contrast to previous studies that relied mostly on overexpression. We show that STIM1 phosphorylation at ERK/CDK sites is not required for SOCE activation, cell migration, or ER partitioning during mitosis. These results rule out STIM1 phosphorylation as a regulator of SOCE, migration, and ER distribution in mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Infections typically begin with pathogens adhering to host cells. For bacteria, this adhesion can occur through specific ligand-binding domains. We identify a 20-kDa peptide-binding domain (PBD) in a 1.5-MDa RTX adhesin of a Gram-negative marine bacterium that colonizes diatoms. The crystal structure of this Ca2+-dependent PBD suggests that it may bind the C termini of host cell-surface proteins. A systematic peptide library analysis reveals an optimal tripeptide sequence with 30-nM affinity for the PBD, and X-ray crystallography details its peptide-protein interactions. Binding of the PBD to the diatom partner of the bacteria can be inhibited or competed away by the peptide, providing a molecular basis for inhibiting bacterium-host interactions. We further show that this PBD is found in other bacteria, including human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and Aeromonas veronii. Here, we produce the PBD ortholog from A. veronii and demonstrate, using the same peptide inhibitor, how pathogens may be prevented from adhering to their hosts.

Abstract: Summary
Behaviorally relevant sounds are often composed of distinct acoustic units organized into specific temporal sequences. The meaning of such sound sequences can therefore be fully recognized only when they have terminated. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of sound sequences remain unclear. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of behaving mice to test the hypothesis that neural responses to termination of sound sequences (“Off-responses”) encode their acoustic history and behavioral salience. We find that auditory cortical Off-responses encode preceding sound sequences and that learning to associate a sound sequence with a reward induces enhancement of Off-responses relative to responses during the sound sequence (“On-responses”). Furthermore, learning enhances network-level discriminability of sound sequences by Off-responses. Last, learning-induced plasticity of Off-responses but not On-responses lasts to the next day. These findings identify auditory cortical Off-responses as a key neural signature of acquired sound-sequence salience.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge during development from the vascular wall of the main embryonic arteries. The onset of circulation triggers several processes that provide critical external factors for HSC generation. Nevertheless, it is not fully understood how and when the onset of circulation affects HSC emergence. Here we show that in Ncx1−/− mouse embryos devoid of circulation the HSC lineage develops until the phenotypic pro-HSC stage. However, these cells reside in an abnormal microenvironment, fail to activate the hematopoietic program downstream of Runx1, and are functionally impaired. Single-cell transcriptomics shows that during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, Ncx1−/− cells fail to undergo a glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation metabolic switch present in wild-type cells. Interestingly, experimental activation of glycolysis results in decreased intraembryonic hematopoiesis. Our results suggest that the onset of circulation triggers metabolic changes that allow HSC generation to proceed.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from a fasted to a fed state is associated with extensive transcriptional remodeling in hepatocytes facilitated by hormonal- and nutritional-regulated transcription factors. Here, we use a liver-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) knockout (L-GRKO) model to investigate the temporal hepatic expression of GR target genes in response to feeding. Interestingly, in addition to the well-described fasting-regulated genes, we identify a subset of hepatic feeding-induced genes that requires GR for full expression. This includes Gck, which is important for hepatic glucose uptake, utilization, and storage. We show that insulin and glucocorticoids cooperatively regulate hepatic Gck expression in a direct GR-dependent manner by a 4.6 kb upstream GR binding site operating as a Gck enhancer. L-GRKO blunts preprandial and early postprandial Gck expression, which ultimately affects early postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, phosphorylation, and glycogen storage. Thus, GR is positively involved in feeding-induced gene expression and important for postprandial glucose metabolism in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
We perform an immunogenomics analysis utilizing whole-transcriptome sequencing of 657 pediatric extracranial solid cancer samples representing 14 diagnoses, and additionally utilize transcriptomes of 131 pediatric cancer cell lines and 147 normal tissue samples for comparison. We describe patterns of infiltrating immune cells, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion, and translationally relevant immune checkpoints. We find that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and TCR counts vary widely across cancer types and within each diagnosis, and notably are significantly predictive of survival in osteosarcoma patients. We identify potential cancer-specific immunotherapeutic targets for adoptive cell therapies including cell-surface proteins, tumor germline antigens, and lineage-specific transcription factors. Using an orthogonal immunopeptidomics approach, we find several potential immunotherapeutic targets in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma and validated PRAME as a bona fide multi-pediatric cancer target. Importantly, this work provides a critical framework for immune targeting of extracranial solid tumors using parallel immuno-transcriptomic and -peptidomic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) morphogen pathway is fundamental for embryonic development and stem cell maintenance and is implicated in various cancers. A key step in signaling is transfer of a palmitate group to the SHH N terminus, catalyzed by the multi-pass transmembrane enzyme Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). We present the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of HHAT bound to substrate analog palmityl-coenzyme A and a SHH-mimetic megabody, revealing a heme group bound to HHAT that is essential for HHAT function. A structure of HHAT bound to potent small-molecule inhibitor IMP-1575 revealed conformational changes in the active site that occlude substrate binding. Our multidisciplinary analysis provides a detailed view of the mechanism by which HHAT adapts the membrane environment to transfer an acyl chain across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This structure of a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily member provides a blueprint for other protein-substrate MBOATs and a template for future drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The persistence of anti-viral immunity is essential for protection and exhibits profound heterogeneity across individuals. Here, we elucidate the factors that shape maintenance and function of anti-viral T cell immunity in the body by comprehensive profiling of virus-specific T cells across blood, lymphoid organs, and mucosal tissues of organ donors. We use flow cytometry, T cell receptor sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics, and cytokine analysis to profile virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing the ubiquitous pathogens influenza and cytomegalovirus. Our results reveal that virus specificity determines overall magnitude, tissue distribution, differentiation, and clonal repertoire of virus-specific T cells. Age and sex influence T cell differentiation and dissemination in tissues, while T cell tissue residence and functionality are highly correlated with the site. Together, our results demonstrate how the covariates of virus, tissue, age, and sex impact the anti-viral immune response, which is important for targeting, monitoring, and predicting immune responses to existing and emerging viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Ongoing inchworm-like CAG and CGG repeat expansions in brains, arising by aberrant processing of slipped DNAs, may drive Huntington’s disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism. FAN1 nuclease modifies hyper-expansion rates by unknown means. We show that FAN1, through iterative cycles, binds, dimerizes, and cleaves slipped DNAs, yielding striking exo-nuclease pauses along slip-outs: 5′-C↓A↓GC↓A↓G-3′ and 5′-C↓T↓G↓C↓T↓G-3′. CAG excision is slower than CTG and requires intra-strand A·A and T·T mismatches. Fully paired hairpins arrested excision, whereas disease-delaying CAA interruptions further slowed excision. Endo-nucleolytic cleavage is insensitive to slip-outs. Rare FAN1 variants are found in individuals with autism with CGG/CCG expansions, and CGG/CCG slip-outs show exo-nuclease pauses. The slip-out-specific ligand, naphthyridine-azaquinolone, which induces contractions of expanded repeats in vivo, requires FAN1 for its effect, and protects slip-outs from FAN1 exo-, but not endo-, nucleolytic digestion. FAN1’s inchworm pausing of slip-out excision rates is well suited to modify inchworm expansion rates, which modify disease onset and progression.

Abstract: Summary
The frontal cortex is essential for organizing voluntary movement. The secondary motor cortex (MOs) is a frontal subregion thought to integrate internal and external inputs before motor action. However, how excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to MOs neurons are integrated preceding movement remains unclear. Here, we address this question by performing in vivo whole-cell recordings from MOs neurons of head-fixed mice moving on a treadmill. We find that principal neurons produce slowly increasing membrane potential and spike ramps preceding spontaneous running. After goal-directed training, ramps show larger amplitudes and accelerated kinetics. Chemogenetic suppression of interneurons combined with modeling suggests that the interplay between parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons, along with principal neuron recurrent connectivity, shape ramping signals. Plasticity of excitatory synapses on SOM+ interneurons can explain the ramp acceleration after training. Altogether, our data reveal that local interneurons differentially control task-dependent ramping signals when MOs neurons integrate inputs preceding movement.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial toxin-antitoxin modules contribute to the stress adaptation, persistence, and dormancy of bacteria for survival under environmental stresses and are involved in bacterial pathogenesis. In Salmonella Typhimurium, the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase toxin TacT reportedly acetylates the α-amino groups of the aminoacyl moieties of several aminoacyl-tRNAs, inhibits protein synthesis, and promotes persister formation during the infection of macrophages. Here, we show that TacT exclusively acetylates Gly-tRNAGly in vivo and in vitro. The crystal structure of the TacT:acetyl-Gly-tRNAGly complex and the biochemical analysis reveal that TacT specifically recognizes the discriminator U73 and G71 in tRNAGly, a combination that is only found in tRNAGly isoacceptors, and discriminates tRNAGly from other tRNA species. Thus, TacT is a Gly-tRNAGly-specific acetyltransferase toxin. The molecular basis of the specific aminoacyl-tRNA acetylation by TacT provides advanced information for the design of drugs targeting Salmonella.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria contain a specific translation machinery for the synthesis of mitochondria-encoded respiratory chain components. Mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) are also generated from the mitochondrial DNA and, similar to their cytoplasmic counterparts, are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we find that the RNA methyltransferase METTL8 is a mitochondrial protein that facilitates 3-methyl-cytidine (m3C) methylation at position C32 of the mt-tRNASer(UCN) and mt-tRNAThr. METTL8 knockout cells show a reduction in respiratory chain activity, whereas overexpression increases activity. In pancreatic cancer, METTL8 levels are high, which correlates with lower patient survival and an enhanced respiratory chain activity. Mitochondrial ribosome profiling uncovered mitoribosome stalling on mt-tRNASer(UCN)- and mt-tRNAThr-dependent codons. Further analysis of the respiratory chain complexes using mass spectrometry revealed reduced incorporation of the mitochondrially encoded proteins ND6 and ND1 into complex I. The well-balanced translation of mt-tRNASer(UCN)- and mt-tRNAThr-dependent codons through METTL8-mediated m3C32 methylation might, therefore, facilitate the optimal composition and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Abstract: Summary
Excess liver fat, called hepatic steatosis, is a leading risk factor for end-stage liver disease and cardiometabolic diseases but often remains undiagnosed in clinical practice because of the need for direct imaging assessments. We developed an abdominal MRI-based machine-learning algorithm to accurately estimate liver fat (correlation coefficients, 0.97–0.99) from a truth dataset of 4,511 middle-aged UK Biobank participants, enabling quantification in 32,192 additional individuals. 17% of participants had predicted liver fat levels indicative of steatosis, and liver fat could not have been reliably estimated based on clinical factors such as BMI. A genome-wide association study of common genetic variants and liver fat replicated three known associations and identified five newly associated variants in or near the MTARC1, ADH1B, TRIB1, GPAM, and MAST3 genes (p < 3 × 10−8). A polygenic score integrating these eight genetic variants was strongly associated with future risk of chronic liver disease (hazard ratio > 1.32 per SD score, p < 9 × 10−17). Rare inactivating variants in the APOB or MTTP genes were identified in 0.8% of individuals with steatosis and conferred more than 6-fold risk (p < 2 × 10−5), highlighting a molecular subtype of hepatic steatosis characterized by defective secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. We demonstrate that our imaging-based machine-learning model accurately estimates liver fat and may be useful in epidemiological and genetic studies of hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
The EGFR/Erk pathway is triggered by extracellular ligand stimulation, leading to stimulus-dependent dynamics of pathway activity. Although mechanical properties of the microenvironment also affect Erk activity, their effects on Erk signaling dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we characterize how the stiffness of the underlying substratum affects Erk signaling dynamics in mammary epithelial cells. We find that soft microenvironments attenuate Erk signaling, both at steady state and in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Optogenetic manipulation at multiple signaling nodes reveals that intracellular signal transmission is largely unaffected by substratum stiffness. Instead, we find that soft microenvironments decrease EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and alter the amount and spatial distribution of EGF binding at cell membranes. Our data demonstrate that the mechanical microenvironment tunes Erk signaling dynamics via receptor-ligand interactions, underscoring how multiple microenvironmental signals are jointly processed through a highly conserved pathway that regulates tissue development, homeostasis, and disease progression.
