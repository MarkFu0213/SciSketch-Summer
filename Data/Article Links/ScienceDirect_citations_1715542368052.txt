Abstract: Summary
Control of CNS pathogens by CD8 T cells is key to avoid fatal neuroinflammation. Yet, the modalities of MHC I presentation in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the antigen presentation mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell-mediated control of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite in the CNS. We show that MHC I presentation of an efficiently processed model antigen (GRA6-OVA), even when not expressed in the bradyzoite stage, reduces cyst burden and dampens encephalitis in C57BL/6 mice. Antigen presentation assays with infected primary neurons reveal a correlation between lower MHC I presentation of tachyzoite antigens by neurons and poor parasite control in vivo. Using conditional MHC I-deficient mice, we find that neuronal MHC I presentation is required for robust restriction of T. gondii in the CNS during chronic phase, showing the importance of MHC I presentation by CNS neurons in the control of a prevalent brain pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
How tissue patterns are formed and maintained are fundamental questions. The murine tongue epithelium, a paradigm for tissue patterning, consists of an array of specialized fungiform papillae structures that harbor taste cells. The formation of fungiform papillae is preceded by pronounced spatial changes in gene expression, in which taste cell genes such as Shh, initially diffused in lingual epithelial progenitors, become restricted to taste cells when their specification progresses. However, the requirement of spatial restriction of taste cell gene expression for patterning and formation of fungiform papillae is unknown. Here, we show that a chromatin regulator, Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1, is required for proper maintenance of fungiform papillae by repressing Shh and preventing ectopic SHH signaling in non-taste cells. Ablation of SHH signaling in PRC1-null non-taste cells rescues the maintenance of taste cells. Altogether, our studies exemplify how epigenetic regulation establishes spatial gene expression patterns necessary for specialized niche structures.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of chromatin that regulate DNA access and are composed of histone octamers. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers like ISW2 regulate chromatin access by translationally moving nucleosomes to different DNA regions. We find that histone octamers are more pliable than previously assumed and distorted by ISW2 early in remodeling before DNA enters nucleosomes and the ATPase motor moves processively on nucleosomal DNA. Uncoupling the ATPase activity of ISW2 from nucleosome movement with deletion of the SANT domain from the C terminus of the Isw2 catalytic subunit traps remodeling intermediates in which the histone octamer structure is changed. We find restricting histone movement by chemical crosslinking also traps remodeling intermediates resembling those seen early in ISW2 remodeling with loss of the SANT domain. Other evidence shows histone octamers are intrinsically prone to changing their conformation and can be distorted merely by H3-H4 tetramer disulfide crosslinking.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) undergoes metabolic reprogramming to meet the high ATP and anabolic demands of the tumor cells. However, the role of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and its regulators in the GBM context has been largely unknown. Here, we show that the neural stem cell pro-proliferative factor acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP, also known as DBI) is highly expressed in GBM, and by binding to acyl-CoAs, it cell-autonomously maintains high proliferation rates, promoting tumor growth and poor survival in several preclinical models. Mechanistic experiments using ACBP-acyl-CoA binding affinity variants and pharmacological FAO modulators suggest that ACBP supports tumor growth by controlling the availability of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to mitochondria, promoting FAO in GBM. Thus, our findings uncover a critical link between lipid metabolism and GBM progression established by ACBP and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for an effective anti-proliferative metabolic management of GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell transcriptome profiling of heterogeneous tissues can provide high-resolution windows into developmental dynamics and environmental responses, but its application to plants has been limited. Here, we used the high-throughput Drop-seq approach to profile >12,000 cells from Arabidopsis roots. This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates. Collectively, we demonstrate that single-cell RNA-seq can be used to profile developmental processes in plants and show how they can be altered by external stimuli.

Abstract: We used a murine spontaneous osteosarcoma cell line with high metastatic potential, the K7M2 cell line to study the role of Notch signaling in the biological manifestations of osteosarcoma, to understand its underlying mechanism in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, and to improve patient prognosis in cases of osteosarcoma through the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, First, Notch expression in K7M2 was determined by immunostaining, and the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was used to inhibit proteolytic cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), resulting in the inhibition of Notch activation. By using the Sulforhodamine B assay, colony-forming units assay, Brdu and Ki67 staining, and flow cytometry assays of apoptosis and cell cycle stage, DAPT was found to inhibit K7M2 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. By using wound healing and transwell migration assays, DAPT was found to inhibit K7M2 migration in a dose-dependent manner as well. By using a combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy and K-means clustering analysis, we found that DAPT inhibit a variety of important cell metabolism-related components in most K7M2 cell structures. Then, DAPT was found to inhibit Notch1ICD expression in a concentration-dependent manner, and this expression was directly correlated with Phospho-Erk1/2 (p-Erk) by using Western blotting. To confirm this finding, we used the Notch signaling ligand Jagged1 to activate the Notch signaling pathway, which in turn up-regulated p-Erk, resulting in increased proliferation and migration of K7M2. Using the Erk pathway inhibitor U0126, we showed that p-Erk was downregulated and the proliferation and migration of K7M2 decreased along with it. Finally, we constructed a K7M2 mouse para-tibial tumor model and lung metastatic model. We found DAPT inhibits p-Erk in vivo, effectively controls tumor growth, reduces angiogenesis, reduces metastasis to the lungs, and improves overall survival. In summary, Notch signaling plays an oncogene role and promotes metastasis in osteosarcoma through p-Erk. DAPT effectively inhibits osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting Erk phosphorylation. Therefore, the inhibition of Notch activation resulted the down-regulation of phosphorylation of Erk pathway can be used as potential therapeutic targets in clinical treatment to improve osteosarcoma prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Ripretinib (DCC-2618) was designed to inhibit the full spectrum of mutant KIT and PDGFRA kinases found in cancers and myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), in which the heterogeneity of drug-resistant KIT mutations is a major challenge. Ripretinib is a “switch-control” kinase inhibitor that forces the activation loop (or activation “switch”) into an inactive conformation. Ripretinib inhibits all tested KIT and PDGFRA mutants, and notably is a type II kinase inhibitor demonstrated to broadly inhibit activation loop mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, previously thought only achievable with type I inhibitors. Ripretinib shows efficacy in preclinical cancer models, and preliminary clinical data provide proof-of-concept that ripretinib inhibits a wide range of KIT mutants in patients with drug-resistant GISTs.

Abstract: Summary
Direct bacterial recognition by innate receptors is crucial for bacterial clearance. Here, we show that the IgA receptor CD89 is a major innate receptor that directly binds bacteria independently of its cognate ligands IgA and c-reactive protein (CRP). This binding is only partially inhibited by serum IgA and induces bacterial phagocytosis by CD11c+ dendritic cells and monocytes and/or macrophages, suggesting a physiological role in innate host defense. Blood phagocytes from common variable immunodeficiency patients bind, internalize, and kill bacteria in a CD89-dependent manner, confirming the IgA independence of this mechanism. In vivo, CD89 transgenic mice are protected in two different models of sepsis: a model of pneumonia and the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) polymicrobial model of infection. These data identify CD89 as a first-line innate receptor for bacterial clearance before adaptive responses can be mounted. Fc receptors may emerge as a class of innate receptors for various bacteria with pleiotropic roles.

Abstract: Summary
FCRL5+ atypical memory B cells (atMBCs) expand in many chronic human infections, including recurrent malaria, but studies have drawn opposing conclusions about their function. Here, in mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi, we demonstrate expansion of an antigen-specific FCRL5+ population that is distinct from previously described FCRL5+ innate-like murine subsets. Comparative analyses reveal overlapping phenotypic and transcriptomic signatures between FCRL5+ B cells from Plasmodium-infected mice and atMBCs from Plasmodium-exposed humans. In infected mice, FCRL5 is expressed on the majority of antigen-specific germinal-center-derived memory B cells (MBCs). Upon challenge, FCRL5+ MBCs rapidly give rise to antibody-producing cells expressing additional atypical markers, demonstrating functionality in vivo. Moreover, atypical markers are expressed on antigen-specific MBCs generated by immunization in both mice and humans, indicating that the atypical phenotype is not restricted to chronic settings. This study resolves conflicting interpretations of atMBC function and suggests FCRL5+ B cells as an attractive target for vaccine strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1α) is an indispensable step in remedying the cellular stress associated with lipid perturbation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. IRE1α is a single-spanning ER transmembrane protein possessing both kinase and endonuclease functions, and its activation can be fully achieved through the dimerization and/or oligomerization process. How IRE1α senses membrane lipid saturation remains largely unresolved. Using both computational and experimental tools, we systematically investigated the dimerization process of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of IRE1α and found that, with help of the serine 450 residue, the conserved tryptophan 457 residue buttresses the core dimerization interface of IRE1α-TMD. BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) experiments revealed that mutation on these residues abolished the saturated fatty acid-induced dimerization in the ER membrane and subsequently inactivated IRE1α activity in vivo. Therefore, our results suggest that the structural elements of IRE1α-TMD serve as a key sensor that detects membrane aberrancy.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotypic interactions across diverse cell types can enable tumor progression and hold the potential to expand therapeutic interventions. Here, combined profiling and functional studies of glioma cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) models establish that PTEN deficiency activates YAP1, which directly upregulates lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression. Mechanistically, secreted LOX functions as a potent macrophage chemoattractant via activation of the β1 integrin-PYK2 pathway in macrophages. These infiltrating macrophages secrete SPP1, which sustains glioma cell survival and stimulates angiogenesis. In PTEN-null GBM models, LOX inhibition markedly suppresses macrophage infiltration and tumor progression. Correspondingly, YAP1-LOX and β1 integrin-SPP1 signaling correlates positively with higher macrophage density and lower overall survival in GBM patients. This symbiotic glioma-macrophage interplay provides therapeutic targets specifically for PTEN-deficient GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium parasites are highly selective when infecting hepatocytes and induce many changes within the host cell upon infection. While several host cell factors have been identified that are important for liver infection, our understanding of what facilitates the maintenance of infection remains incomplete. Here, we describe a role for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) (p-RPS6) in Plasmodium yoelii-infected hepatocytes. Blocking RPS6 phosphorylation prior to infection decreases the number of liver stage parasites within 24 h. Infected hepatocytes exhibit elevated levels of p-RPS6 while simultaneously abrogating the induction of phosphorylation of RPS6 in response to insulin stimulation. This is in contrast with the regulation of p-RPS6 by Toxoplasma gondii, which elevates levels of p-RPS6 after infection but does not alter the response to insulin. Our data support a model in which RPS6 phosphorylation is uncoupled from canonical regulators in Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes and is relied on by the parasite to maintain infection.

Abstract: Summary
Lung inflammation induced by silica impairs host control of tuberculosis, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that silica-driven exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection associates with raised type 2 immunity. Silica increases pulmonary Th2 cell and M2 macrophage responses, while reducing type 1 immunity after M. tuberculosis infection. Silica induces lung damage that prompts extracellular self-DNA release and activates STING. This STING priming potentiates M. tuberculosis DNA sensing by and activation of cGAS/STING, which triggers enhanced type I interferon (IFNI) response and type 2 immunity. cGAS-, STING-, and IFNAR-deficient mice are resistant to silica-induced exacerbation of M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, silica-induced self-DNA primes the host response to M. tuberculosis-derived nucleic acids, which increases type 2 immunity while reducing type 1 immunity, crucial for controlling M. tuberculosis infection. These data show how cGAS/STING pathway activation, at the crossroads of sterile inflammation and infection, may affect the host response to pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
The regenerative capacity of the human endometrium requires a population of local stem cells. However, the phenotypes, locations, and origin of these cells are still unknown. In a mouse menstruation model, uterine stromal SM22α+-derived CD34+KLF4+ stem cells are activated and integrate into the regeneration area, where they differentiate and incorporate into the endometrial epithelium; this process is correlated with enhanced protein SUMOylation in CD34+KLF4+ cells. Mice with a stromal SM22α-specific SENP1 deletion (SENP1smKO) exhibit accelerated endometrial repair in the regeneration model and develop spontaneous uterine hyperplasia. Mechanistic studies suggest that SENP1 deletion induces SUMOylation of ERα, which augments ERα transcriptional activity and proliferative signaling in SM22α+CD34+KLF4+ cells. These cells then transdifferentiate to the endometrial epithelium. Our study reveals that CD34+KLF4+ stromal-resident stem cells directly contribute to endometrial regeneration, which is regulated through SENP1-mediated ERα suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are widely distributed cells of ramified morphology in adult brain that express PDGFRα and NG2. They retain mitotic activities in adulthood and contribute to oligodendrogenesis and myelin turnover; however, the regulatory mechanisms of their cell dynamics in adult brain largely remain unknown. Here, we found that global Pdgfra inactivation in adult mice rapidly led to elimination of OPCs due to synchronous maturation toward oligodendrocytes. Surprisingly, OPC densities were robustly reconstituted by the active expansion of Nestin+ immature cells activated in meninges and brain parenchyma, as well as a few OPCs that escaped from Pdgfra inactivation. The multipotent immature cells were induced in the meninges of Pdgfra-inactivated mice, but not of control mice. Our findings revealed powerful homeostatic control of adult OPCs, engaging dual cellular sources of adult OPC formation. These properties of the adult oligodendrocyte lineage and the alternative OPC source may be exploited in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent health problem. The insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been suggested to play important roles in the development and progression of NAFLD. However these processes and correlations have not fully been understood yet. Azoramide, an antidiabetic drug, has the potential for reducing insulin resistance and ER stress in obese mice. To date, there is no study on the effects of azoramide in NAFLD. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of azoramide on insulin resistance and ER stress in NAFLD induced mice. Forty Swiss Albino mice were assigned into control, azoramide, fructose and fructose + azoramide groups. Azoramide group received a single dose of azoramide at 150 mg/kg/day by gavage between 71–77th days. Fructose group was treated with 30% fructose solution for 70 days to generate NAFLD. Fructose + azoramide group was treated with 30% fructose for 70 days and then with a single dose of 150 mg/kg/day azoramide for 7 days. At the end of experiment, blood of mice was taken via cardiac puncture, and the livers were excised and weighted. GRP78 and XBP-1 levels were examined with immunohistochemistry in liver tissues. Liver steatosis was evaluated with H&E, Oil-Red O and Sudan-Black staining. ALT, AST, triglyceride, total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, HDL, fasting glucose and insulin levels were measured in serum. The body and liver weights, insulin resistance, ER-stress markers, lipid profile, AST, ALT and histopathological changes increased by fructose treatment. Azoramide treatment was generally reversed all these changes. These data offer the first evidence to show that azoramide may serve as a potential treatment agent in NAFLD through decreasing the ER-stress and insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Biological roles for most long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain mysterious. Here, using forward genetics, we identify lep-5, a lncRNA acting in the C. elegans heterochronic (developmental timing) pathway. Loss of lep-5 delays hypodermal maturation and male tail tip morphogenesis (TTM), hallmarks of the juvenile-to-adult transition. We find that lep-5 is a ∼600 nt cytoplasmic RNA that is conserved across Caenorhabditis and possesses three essential secondary structure motifs but no essential open reading frames. lep-5 expression is temporally controlled, peaking prior to TTM onset. Like the Makorin LEP-2, lep-5 facilitates the degradation of LIN-28, a conserved miRNA regulator specifying the juvenile state. Both LIN-28 and LEP-2 associate with lep-5 in vivo, suggesting that lep-5 directly regulates LIN-28 stability and may function as an RNA scaffold. These studies identify a key biological role for a lncRNA: by regulating protein stability, it provides a temporal cue to facilitate the juvenile-to-adult transition.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cells dynamically self-organize in response to extracellular spatial cues relayed by cell-surface receptors. During convergent extension in Drosophila, Toll-related receptors direct planar polarized cell rearrangements that elongate the head-to-tail axis. However, many cells establish polarity in the absence of Toll receptor activity, indicating the presence of additional spatial cues. Here we demonstrate that the leucine-rich-repeat receptor Tartan and the teneurin Ten-m provide critical polarity signals at epithelial compartment boundaries. The Tartan and Ten-m extracellular domains interact in vitro, and Tartan promotes Ten-m localization to compartment boundaries in vivo. We show that Tartan and Ten-m are necessary for the planar polarity and organization of compartment boundary cells. Moreover, ectopic stripes of Tartan and Ten-m are sufficient to induce myosin accumulation at stripe boundaries. These results demonstrate that the Tartan/Ten-m and Toll receptor systems together create a high-resolution network of spatial cues that guides cell behavior during convergent extension.

Abstract: The middle cervical ganglion (MCG) has been shown to contain neurotransmitters and related substances in the cat, dog and sheep. However, little is known about their presence or distribution in the human MCG. In this study, immunohistochemistry for catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes and neuropeptides was performed on the MCG in human cadavers. In 4 samples of human cadavers, MCG swellings contained numerous postganglionic neurons. In another sample, a distinct swelling of the MCG could not be detected. However, neuronal cell bodies were present within the sympathetic nerve trunk between the superior cervical and stellate ganglia. The cell size analysis demonstrated that cell bodies of postganglionic neurons measured 94.1–1774.1 μm2 (mean ± S.D. = 578.1 ± 127.7 μm2) in the MCG. Postganglionic neurons in the MCG were immunoreactive for dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH, 92.1%), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 59.3%), neuropeptide Y (NPY, 71.9%) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP, 19.3%). TH-positive neurons in the human MCG appear to be infrequent compared to the sheep MCG in a previous study. In the superior cervical (SCG) and stellate ganglia (SG), 91.0% and 94.2%, respectively, of postganglionic neurons showed DBH-immunoreactivity. A total of 83.8% and 70.4%of them contained TH-immunoreactivity in the SCG and SG. However, expression of NPY in the SG (78.2%) was more abundant than in the SCG (59.1%). Only 16.4% and 13.8% of postganglionic neurons were immunoreactive for VIP in the SCG and SG, respectively. VIP-immunoreactivity was also expressed by nerve fibers surrounding some postganglionic neurons in the MCG (8.7%), SCG (11.5%) and SG (5.9%). The present study suggests that catecholamine, NPY and VIP are neurotransmitters in the MCG, SCG and SG of the human.

Abstract: Summary
Mxra8 is a recently described receptor for multiple alphaviruses, including Chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. To determine its role in pathogenesis, we generated mice with mutant Mxra8 alleles: an 8-nucleotide deletion that produces a truncated, soluble form (Mxra8Δ8/Δ8) and a 97-nucleotide deletion that abolishes Mxra8 expression (Mxra8Δ97/Δ97). Mxra8Δ8/Δ8 and Mxra8Δ97/Δ97 fibroblasts show reduced CHIKV infection in culture, and Mxra8Δ8/Δ8 and Mxra8Δ97/Δ97 mice have decreased infection of musculoskeletal tissues with CHIKV, MAYV, RRV, or ONNV. Less foot swelling is observed in CHIKV-infected Mxra8 mutant mice, which correlated with fewer infiltrating neutrophils and cytokines. A recombinant E2-D71A CHIKV with diminished binding to Mxra8 is attenuated in vivo in wild-type mice. Ectopic Mxra8 expression is sufficient to enhance CHIKV infection and lethality in transgenic flies. These studies establish a role for Mxra8 in the pathogenesis of multiple alphaviruses and suggest that targeting this protein may mitigate disease in humans.

Metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 delays regeneration in holothurians,

Abstract: The effect of the GM6001 metalloproteinase inhibitor on the regeneration of ambulacral structures in Eupentacta fraudatrix has been investigated. Inhibition of proteinase activity exerts a marked effect on regeneration, being dependent on the time when GM6001 is injected. When administration of the inhibitor begins on day 3 post-injury, regeneration is completely abolished, and the animals die. This means that early activation of proteinases is crucial for triggering the regenerative process in holothurians. When GM6001 in first injected on day 7 post-injury, the regeneration rate decreases. However, this effect has proven to be reversible: when inhibition ceases, the regeneration resumes. The effect of the inhibitor is manifested as a retarded degradation of the extracellular matrix, the lack of cell dedifferentiation, and, probably, a slower cell migration. The gelatinase activity is detected in all the regenerating organs of E. fraudatrix. In the holothurian Cucumaria japonica, which is not capable of healing skin wounds and ambulacrum reparation, no gelatinase activity was observed at the site of damage. A suggestion is made that proteinases play an important role in regeneration in holothurians. The most probable morphogenesis regulators are matrix metalloproteinases with gelatinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Breast tumors are inherently heterogeneous, but the evolving cellular organization through neoplastic progression is poorly understood. Here we report a rapid, large-scale single-cell resolution 3D imaging protocol based on a one-step clearing agent that allows visualization of normal tissue architecture and entire tumors at cellular resolution. Imaging of multicolor lineage-tracing models of breast cancer targeted to either basal or luminal progenitor cells revealed profound clonal restriction during progression. Expression profiling of clones arising in Pten/Trp53-deficient tumors identified distinct molecular signatures. Strikingly, most clones harbored cells that had undergone an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating widespread, inherent plasticity. Hence, an integrative pipeline that combines lineage tracing, 3D imaging, and clonal RNA sequencing technologies offers a comprehensive path for studying mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in whole tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Certain proteins and organelles can be selectively degraded by autophagy. Typical substrates and receptors of selective autophagy have LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) that bind to autophagosomal LC3 and GABARAP family proteins. Here, we performed a differential interactome screen using wild-type LC3B and a LIR recognition-deficient mutant and identified TEX264 as a receptor for autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy). TEX264 is an ER protein with a single transmembrane domain and a LIR motif. TEX264 interacts with LC3 and GABARAP family proteins more efficiently and is expressed more ubiquitously than previously known ER-phagy receptors. ER-phagy is profoundly blocked by deletion of TEX264 alone and almost completely by additional deletion of FAM134B and CCPG1. A long intrinsically disordered region of TEX264 is required for its ER-phagy receptor function to bridge the gap between the ER and autophagosomal membranes independently of its amino acid sequence. These results suggest that TEX264 is a major ER-phagy receptor.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial interactions are major drivers of microbial community dynamics and functions but remain challenging to identify because of limitations in parallel culturing and absolute abundance quantification of community members across environments and replicates. To this end, we developed Microbial Interaction Network Inference in microdroplets (MINI-Drop). Fluorescence microscopy coupled to computer vision techniques were used to rapidly determine the absolute abundance of each strain in hundreds to thousands of droplets per condition. We showed that MINI-Drop could accurately infer pairwise and higher-order interactions in synthetic consortia. We developed a stochastic model of community assembly to provide insight into the heterogeneity in community states across droplets. Finally, we elucidated the complex web of interactions linking antibiotics and different species in a synthetic consortium. In sum, we demonstrated a robust and generalizable method to infer microbial interaction networks by random encapsulation of sub-communities into microfluidic droplets.

Abstract: Summary
Damage to regional cerebrovascular networks and neuronal tissues occurs during acute cerebrovascular diseases, such as ischemic stroke. The promotion of vascular regeneration is the most promising therapeutic approach. To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain vascular regeneration, we developed two zebrafish cerebrovascular injury models using genetic ablation and photochemical thrombosis. Although brain parenchyma is physiologically devoid of lymphatic vasculature, we found that cerebrovascular injuries induce rapid ingrowth of meningeal lymphatics into the injured parenchyma. The ingrown lymphatics on one hand become lumenized to drain interstitial fluid to resolve brain edema and on the other hand act as “growing tracks” for nascent blood vessels. The ingrown lymphatic vessels undergo apoptosis and clearance after cerebrovascular regeneration. This study reveals a pathological function of meningeal lymphatics, through previously unexpected ingrowth into brain parenchyma and a newly identified lymphatic function as vascular “growing tracks.”

Abstract: Summary
Cancer is often seen as a disease of mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. However, some cancers, including pediatric rhabdoid tumors (RTs), lack recurrent alterations targetable by current drugs and need alternative, informed therapeutic options. To nominate potential targets, we performed a high-throughput small-molecule screen complemented by a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gene-knockout screen in a large number of RT and control cell lines. These approaches converged to reveal several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as therapeutic targets, with RTK inhibition effective in suppressing RT cell growth in vitro and against a xenograft model in vivo. RT cell lines highly express and activate (phosphorylate) different RTKs, creating dependency without mutation or amplification. Downstream of RTK signaling, we identified PTPN11, encoding the pro-growth signaling protein SHP2, as a shared dependency across all RT cell lines. This study demonstrates that large-scale perturbational screening can uncover vulnerabilities in cancers with “quiet” genomes.

Abstract: Summary
V(D)J recombination is essential to generate antigen receptor diversity but is also a potent cause of genome instability. Many chromosome alterations that result from aberrant V(D)J recombination involve breaks at single recombination signal sequences (RSSs). A long-standing question, however, is how such breaks occur. Here, we show that the genomic DNA that is excised during recombination, the excised signal circle (ESC), forms a complex with the recombinase proteins to efficiently catalyze breaks at single RSSs both in vitro and in vivo. Following cutting, the RSS is released while the ESC-recombinase complex remains intact to potentially trigger breaks at further RSSs. Consistent with this, chromosome breaks at RSSs increase markedly in the presence of the ESC. Notably, these breaks co-localize with those found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and occur at key cancer driver genes. We have named this reaction “cut-and-run” and suggest that it could be a significant cause of lymphocyte genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
Oxygen (O2) is both an indispensable metabolic substrate and a regulatory signal that controls the activity of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (Hif1a), a mediator of the cellular adaptation to low O2 tension (hypoxia). Hypoxic cells require Hif1a to survive. Additionally, Hif1a is an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Hence, we hypothesized that enhancing mitochondrial respiration is detrimental to the survival of hypoxic cells in vivo. We tested this hypothesis in the fetal growth plate, which is hypoxic. Our findings show that mitochondrial respiration is dispensable for survival of growth plate chondrocytes. Furthermore, its impairment prevents the extreme hypoxia and the massive chondrocyte death observed in growth plates lacking Hif1a. Consequently, augmenting mitochondrial respiration affects the survival of hypoxic chondrocytes by, at least in part, increasing intracellular hypoxia. We thus propose that partial suppression of mitochondrial respiration is crucial during development to protect the tissues that are physiologically hypoxic from lethal intracellular anoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Enzyme function and evolution are influenced by the larger context of a metabolic pathway. Deleterious mutations or perturbations in one enzyme can often be compensated by mutations to others. We used comparative genomics and experiments to examine evolutionary interactions with the essential metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Analyses of synteny and co-occurrence across bacterial species indicate that DHFR is coupled to thymidylate synthase (TYMS) but relatively independent from the rest of folate metabolism. Using quantitative growth rate measurements and forward evolution in Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that the two enzymes adapt as a relatively independent unit in response to antibiotic stress. Metabolomic profiling revealed that TYMS activity must not exceed DHFR activity to prevent the depletion of reduced folates and the accumulation of the intermediate dihydrofolate. Comparative genomics analyses identified >200 gene pairs with similar statistical signatures of modular co-evolution, suggesting that cellular pathways may be decomposable into small adaptive units.

Abstract: Summary
Sholl analysis has been an important technique in dendritic anatomy for more than 60 years. The Sholl intersection profile is obtained by counting the number of dendritic branches at a given distance from the soma and is a key measure of dendritic complexity; it has applications from evaluating the changes in structure induced by pathologies to estimating the expected number of anatomical synaptic contacts. We find that the Sholl intersection profiles of most neurons can be reproduced from three basic, functional measures: the domain spanned by the dendritic arbor, the total length of the dendrite, and the angular distribution of how far dendritic segments deviate from a direct path to the soma (i.e., the root angle distribution). The first two measures are determined by axon location and hence microcircuit structure; the third arises from optimal wiring and represents a branching statistic estimating the need for conduction speed in a neuron.

Abstract: Summary
Physical performance relies on the concerted action of myriad responses, many of which are under circadian clock control. Little is known, however, regarding the time-dependent effect on exercise performance at the molecular level. We found that both mice and humans exhibit daytime variance in exercise capacity between the early and late part of their active phase. The daytime variance in mice was dependent on exercise intensity and relied on the circadian clock proteins PER1/2. High-throughput gene expression and metabolic profiling of skeletal muscle revealed metabolic pathways that are differently activated upon exercise in a daytime-dependent manner. Remarkably, we discovered that ZMP, an endogenous AMPK activator, is induced by exercise in a time-dependent manner to regulate key steps in glycolytic and fatty acid oxidation pathways and potentially enhance exercise capacity. Overall, we propose that time of day is a major modifier of exercise capacity and associated metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori chronically colonizes the stomach and is strongly associated with gastric cancer. Its concomitant occurrence with helminths such as schistosomes has been linked to reduced cancer incidence, presumably due to suppression of H. pylori-associated pro-inflammatory responses. However, experimental evidence in support of such a causal link or the mutual interaction of both pathogens is lacking. We investigated the effects of co-infection during the different immune phases of S. mansoni infection. Surprisingly, co-infected mice had increased H. pylori gastric colonization during the interferon gamma (IFNγ) phase of schistosome infection but reduced infiltration of T cells in the stomach due to misdirection of antigen-experienced CXCR3+ T cells to the liver. Unexpectedly, H. pylori co-infection resulted in partial protection from schistosome-induced liver damage. Here, we demonstrate that an increase in fibrosis-protective IL-13Ra2 is associated with H. pylori infection. Thus, our study strongly points to an immunological interaction of anatomically isolated pathogens, eventually resulting in altered disease pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Small-cell lung cancer is the most aggressive type of lung cancer, characterized by a remarkable response to chemotherapy followed by development of resistance. Here, we describe SCLC subtypes in Mycl- and Nfib-driven GEMM that include CDH1-high peripheral primary tumor lesions and CDH1-negative, aggressive intrapulmonary metastases. Cisplatin treatment preferentially eliminates the latter, thus revealing a striking differential response. Using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach, we find a marked reduction in proliferation and metabolic rewiring following cisplatin treatment and present evidence for a distinctive metabolic and structural profile defining intrinsically resistant populations. This offers perspectives for effective combination therapies that might also hold promise for treating human SCLC, given the very similar response of both mouse and human SCLC to cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebellum has long been implicated in tasks involving precise temporal control, especially in the coordination of movements. Here we asked whether the cerebellum represents temporal aspects of oscillatory neuronal activity, measured as instantaneous phase and difference between instantaneous phases of oscillations in two cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive function. We simultaneously recorded Purkinje cell (PC) single-unit spike activity in cerebellar lobulus simplex (LS) and Crus I and local field potential (LFP) activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus CA1 region (dCA1). Purkinje cells in cerebellar LS and Crus I differentially represented specific phases and phase differences of mPFC and dCA1 LFP oscillations in a frequency-specific manner, suggesting a site- and frequency-specific cerebellar representation of temporal aspects of neuronal oscillations in non-motor cerebral cortical areas. These findings suggest that cerebellar interactions with cerebral cortical areas involved in cognitive functions might involve temporal coordination of neuronal oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
The control of gene expression by transcription factor binding sites frequently determines phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the function of single transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility.

Abstract: Aggregates of disease-causing proteins dysregulate cellular functions, thereby causing neuronal cell loss in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Although many in vitro or in vivo studies of protein aggregate inhibitors have been performed, a therapeutic strategy to control aggregate toxicity has not been earnestly pursued, partly due to the limitations of available aggregate models. In this study, we established a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible nuclear aggregate (β23) expression model to screen potential lead compounds inhibiting β23-induced toxicity. High-throughput screening identified several natural compounds as nuclear β23 inhibitors, including peucedanocoumarin III (PCIII). Interestingly, PCIII accelerates disaggregation and proteasomal clearance of both nuclear and cytosolic β23 aggregates and protects SH-SY5Y cells from toxicity induced by β23 expression. Of translational relevance, PCIII disassembled fibrils and enhanced clearance of cytosolic and nuclear protein aggregates in cellular models of huntingtin and α-synuclein aggregation. Moreover, cellular toxicity was diminished with PCIII treatment for polyglutamine (PolyQ)-huntingtin expression and α-synuclein expression in conjunction with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. Importantly, PCIII not only inhibited α-synuclein aggregation but also disaggregated preformed α-synuclein fibrils in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that a Tet-Off β23 cell model could serve as a robust platform for screening effective lead compounds inhibiting nuclear or cytosolic protein aggregates. Brain-permeable PCIII or its derivatives could be beneficial for eliminating established protein aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
Overeating is a serious issue in modern society, causing many health problems, including obesity. Although the hypothalamus has been previously identified as the key brain structure that regulates body weight homeostasis, the downstream pathways and non-canonical neural circuitry involved in feeding behavior remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we discover that suppressing the activity of GABAergic cells in the anterior ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), whether directly or through long-projection GABAergic inputs from either the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the lateral hypothalamus (LH), is sufficient to promptly induce feeding behavior in well-fed mice. In contrast, optogenetic activation of these cells interrupts food intake in starved mice. Long-term chemogenetic manipulation of vlPAG GABAergic cell activity elicits a corresponding change in mouse body weight. Our studies reveal distinct midbrain GABAergic pathways and highlight an important role of GABAergic cells in the anterior vlPAG in feeding behavior.

Abstract: The "microenvironment" where a tumor develops plays a fundamental role in determining its progression, the onset of metastasis and, eventually, its resistance to therapies. Tumor cells can be considered more or less invasive depending both on the nature of the cells and on the site where they are located. Commonly adopted laboratory culture protocols for the investigation of tumor cells take usually place on standard two-dimensional supports. However, such cultures do not allow for reproduction of the biophysical properties of the tumor’s microenvironment, thus causing the cells to lose most of their relevant characteristics. In this work MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells were cultivated within Poly-l-Lactic Acid (PLLA) scaffolds produced via Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS). Starting from a ternary solution (polymer-solvent-nonsolvent) we produced scaffolds with different morphologies, porosities and pore architectures. The influence of porosity and average pore size upon cell adhesion and growth were investigated by using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) as cell viability test, a fluorescence assay staining cell with DAPI and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Our study demonstrates that the average pore size of the polymeric scaffolds influences both the cell adhesion and resulting morphology of the growing breast cancer cells. In particular, the reported data corroborate the evidence that an average pore size ranging from 40 to 50 μm induces tumor cell aggregation and the formation of the irregular tumor masses typically observed in-vivo. In addition, TIPS proved to be a suitable manufacturing technique for finely tuning the scaffolds’ architecture, relevant to developing the most effective microenvironment for an in-vitro tumor cells growth closely mimicking in-vivo conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Undifferentiated sarcomas (USARCs) of adults are diverse, rare, and aggressive soft tissue cancers. Recent sequencing efforts have confirmed that USARCs exhibit one of the highest burdens of structural aberrations across human cancer. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular basis of the structural complexity in USARCs by integrating DNA sequencing, ploidy analysis, gene expression, and methylation profiling. We identified whole genome duplication as a prevalent and pernicious force in USARC tumorigenesis. Using mathematical deconvolution strategies to unravel the complex copy-number profiles and mutational timing models we infer distinct evolutionary pathways of these rare cancers. In addition, 15% of tumors exhibited raised mutational burdens that correlated with gene expression signatures of immune infiltration, and good prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to process and store information in living cells is essential for developing next-generation therapeutics and studying biology in situ. However, existing strategies have limited recording capacity and are challenging to scale. To overcome these limitations, we developed DOMINO, a robust and scalable platform for encoding logic and memory in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Using an efficient single-nucleotide-resolution Read-Write head for DNA manipulation, DOMINO converts the living cells’ DNA into an addressable, readable, and writable medium for computation and storage. DOMINO operators enable analog and digital molecular recording for long-term monitoring of signaling dynamics and cellular events. Furthermore, multiple operators can be layered and interconnected to encode order-independent, sequential, and temporal logic, allowing recording and control over the combination, order, and timing of molecular events in cells. We envision that DOMINO will lay the foundation for building robust and sophisticated computation-and-memory gene circuits for numerous biotechnological and biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated movements are achieved by well-timed activation of selected muscles. This process relies on intact cerebellar circuitry, as demonstrated by motor impairments following cerebellar lesions. Based on anatomical connectivity and symptoms observed in cerebellar patients, we hypothesized that cerebellar dysfunction should disrupt the temporal patterns of motor cortical activity, but not the selected motor plan. To test this hypothesis, we reversibly blocked cerebellar outflow in primates while monitoring motor behavior and neural activity. This manipulation replicated the impaired motor timing and coordination characteristic of cerebellar ataxia. We found extensive changes in motor cortical activity, including loss of response transients at movement onset and decoupling of task-related activity. Nonetheless, the spatial tuning of cells was unaffected, and their early preparatory activity was mostly intact. These results indicate that the timing of actions, but not the selection of muscles, is regulated through cerebellar control of motor cortical activity.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in RNAs and plays regulatory roles in a variety of biological and physiological processes. Despite its important roles, the molecular mechanism underlying m6A-mediated gene regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that m6A-containing RNAs are subject to endoribonucleolytic cleavage via YTHDF2 (m6A reader protein), HRSP12 (adaptor protein), and RNase P/MRP (endoribonucleases). We demonstrate that HRSP12 functions as an adaptor to bridge YTHDF2 and RNase P/MRP, eliciting rapid degradation of YTHDF2-bound RNAs. Transcriptome-wide analyses show that m6A RNAs that are preferentially targeted for endoribonucleolytic cleavage have an HRSP12-binding site and a RNase P/MRP-directed cleavage site upstream and downstream of the YTHDF2-binding site, respectively. We also find that a subset of m6A-containing circular RNAs associates with YTHDF2 in an HRSP12-dependent manner and is selectively downregulated by RNase P/MRP. Thus, our data expand the known functions of RNase P/MRP to endoribonucleolytic cleavage of m6A RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, hematopoiesis occurring in different niches is orchestrated by intrinsic and extrinsic regulators. Previous studies have revealed numerous linear and planar regulatory mechanisms. However, a multi-dimensional transcriptomic atlas of any given hematopoietic organ has not yet been established. Here, we use multiple RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches, including cell type-specific, temporal bulk RNA-seq, in vivo GEO-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), to characterize the detailed spatiotemporal transcriptome during hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) of zebrafish. Combinatorial expression profiling reveals that, in the CHT niche, HSPCs and their neighboring supporting cells are co-regulated by shared signaling pathways and intrinsic factors, such as integrin signaling and Smchd1. Moreover, scRNA-seq analysis unveils the strong association between cell cycle status and HSPC differentiation. Taken together, we report a global transcriptome landscape that provides valuable insights and a rich resource to understand HSPC expansion in an intact vertebrate hematopoietic organ.

Abstract: Summary
2′3′-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is a second messenger that activates the antiviral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. We recently identified a novel role for cGAMP as a soluble, extracellular immunotransmitter that is produced and secreted by cancer cells. Secreted cGAMP is then sensed by host cells, eliciting an antitumoral immune response. Due to the antitumoral effects of cGAMP, other CDN-based STING agonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials for metastatic solid tumors. However, it is unknown how cGAMP and other CDNs cross the cell membrane to activate intracellular STING. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified SLC19A1 as the first known importer of cGAMP and other CDNs, including the investigational new drug 2′3′-bisphosphosphothioate-cyclic-di-AMP (2′3′-CDAS). These discoveries will provide insight into cGAMP’s role as an immunotransmitter and aid in the development of more targeted CDN-based cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydial infection requires the formation of a membrane-bound vacuole, termed the inclusion, that undergoes extensive interactions with select host organelles. The importance of the Inc protein CT229 in the formation and maintenance of the chlamydial inclusion was recently highlighted by studies demonstrating that its absence during infection results in reduced bacterial replication, premature inclusion lysis, and host cell death. Previous reports have indicated that CT229 binds Rab GTPases; however, the physiological implications of this interaction are unknown. Here, we show that CT229 regulates host multivesicular trafficking by recruiting multiple Rab GTPases and their cognate effectors to the inclusion. We demonstrate that CT229 specifically modulates clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking and regulates the trafficking of transferrin and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, both of which are crucial for proper chlamydial development. This study highlights CT229 as a master regulator of multiple host vesicular trafficking pathways essential for chlamydial infection.

Abstract: Summary
O-GalNAc glycosylation is initiated in the Golgi by glycosyltransferases called GALNTs. Proteomic screens identified >600 O-GalNAc-modified proteins, but the biological relevance of these modifications has been difficult to determine. We have discovered a conserved function for GALNT3 in trophoblast stem (TS) cells, blastocyst trophectoderm, and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). The loss of GALNT3 expression in these systems reduces O-GalNAc glycosylation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, Galnt3 expression is reduced in aggressive, mesenchymal claudin-low breast cancer cells. We show that GALNT3 expression controls the O-GalNAc glycosylation of multiple proteins, including E-cadherin in both TS cells and HMECs. The loss of GALNT3 results in the intracellular retention of E-cadherin in the Golgi. Significantly, re-expression of GALNT3 in TS cells increases O-GalNAc glycosylation and restores the epithelial state. Together, these data demonstrate the critical biological role of GALNT3 O-GalNAc glycosylation to promote the epithelial phenotype in TS cells, blastocyst trophectoderm, and HMECs.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of hepatocyte cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) by hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) drives de novo lipogenesis in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). How alcohol stimulates 2-AG production in HSCs is unknown. Here, we report that chronic alcohol consumption induced hepatic cysteine deficiency and subsequent glutathione depletion by impaired transsulfuration pathway. A compensatory increase in hepatic cystine-glutamate anti-porter xCT boosted extracellular glutamate levels coupled to cystine uptake both in mice and in patients with ALD. Alcohol also induced the selective expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5) in HSCs where mGluR5 activation stimulated 2-AG production. Consistently, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of mGluR5 or xCT attenuated alcoholic steatosis in mice via the suppression of 2-AG production and subsequent CB1R-mediated de novo lipogenesis. We conclude that a bidirectional signaling operates at a metabolic synapse between hepatocytes and HSCs through xCT-mediated glutamate-mGluR5 signaling to produce 2-AG, which induces CB1R-mediated alcoholic steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
RNA binding proteins, the key regulators in gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, remain largely uncharacterized with respect to aging and relevant cognitive deterioration. Here, we report that the levels of SRSF11 are substantially decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of aged brains. Notably, mice with SRSF11 deficiency in the PFC show impaired learning and memory. We demonstrate that SRSF11 directly binds to the 3′ UTR of LRP8 mRNA, as well as to the third exon of apoE mRNA, resulting in stabilization of these mRNAs, eventually deactivating JNK signaling. Importantly, restoration of LRP8 and apoE reduces JNK signaling that is significantly enhanced in SRSF11-deficient cells. In addition, LRP8 and apoE rescue aging-like phenotypes induced by SRSF11 loss. Our findings demonstrate that age-dependent loss of SRSF11 in the PFC reduces levels of apoE and LRP8, leading to activation of the JNK pathway, ultimately influencing cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by 1-cyclopropyl-4-(4-[(5-methyl-3-(3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)methyl]pyridin-2-yl)piperazine (BAY87-2243, abbreviated as B87), a complex I inhibitor, fails to kill human cancer cells in vitro. Driven by this consideration, we attempted to identify agents that engage in synthetically lethal interactions with B87. Here, we report that dimethyl α-ketoglutarate (DMKG), a cell-permeable precursor of α-ketoglutarate that lacks toxicity on its own, kills cancer cells when combined with B87 or other inhibitors of OXPHOS. DMKG improved the antineoplastic effect of B87, both in vitro and in vivo. This combination caused MDM2-dependent, tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53)-independent transcriptional reprogramming and alternative exon usage affecting multiple glycolytic enzymes, completely blocking glycolysis. Simultaneous inhibition of OXPHOS and glycolysis provoked a bioenergetic catastrophe culminating in the activation of a cell death program that involved disruption of the mitochondrial network and activation of PARP1, AIFM1, and APEX1. These results unveil a metabolic liability of human cancer cells that may be harnessed for the development of therapeutic regimens.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid metabolism is frequently perturbed in cancers, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We present comprehensive evidence that oncogene MYC, in collaboration with transcription factor sterol-regulated element-binding protein (SREBP1), regulates lipogenesis to promote tumorigenesis. We used human and mouse tumor-derived cell lines, tumor xenografts, and four conditional transgenic mouse models of MYC-induced tumors to show that MYC regulates lipogenesis genes, enzymes, and metabolites. We found that MYC induces SREBP1, and they collaborate to activate fatty acid (FA) synthesis and drive FA chain elongation from glucose and glutamine. Further, by employing desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI), we observed in vivo lipidomic changes upon MYC induction across different cancers, for example, a global increase in glycerophosphoglycerols. After inhibition of FA synthesis, tumorigenesis was blocked, and tumors regressed in both xenograft and primary transgenic mouse models, revealing the vulnerability of MYC-induced tumors to the inhibition of lipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
p53, the guardian of the genome, requires chaperoning by Hsp70 and Hsp90. However, how the two chaperone machineries affect p53 conformation and regulate its function remains elusive. We found that Hsp70, together with Hsp40, unfolds p53 in an ATP-dependent reaction. This unfolded state of p53 is susceptible to aggregation after release induced by the nucleotide exchange factor Bag-1. However, when Hsp90 and the adaptor protein Hop are present, p53 is transferred from Hsp70 to Hsp90, allowing restoration of the native state upon ATP hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the p53 conformation is constantly remodeled by the two major chaperone machineries. This connects p53 activity to stress, and the levels of free molecular chaperones are important factors regulating p53 activity. Together, our findings reveal an intricate interplay and cooperation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in regulating the conformation of a client.

Abstract: Summary
Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) of the DNA helix are a deleterious form of DNA damage. ICLs can be repaired by the Fanconi anemia pathway. At the center of the pathway is the FANCD2/FANCI complex, recruitment of which to DNA is a critical step for repair. After recruitment, monoubiquitination of both FANCD2 and FANCI leads to their retention on chromatin, ensuring subsequent repair. However, regulation of recruitment is poorly understood. Here, we report a cluster of phosphosites on FANCD2 whose phosphorylation by CK2 inhibits both FANCD2 recruitment to ICLs and its monoubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. We have found that phosphorylated FANCD2 possesses reduced DNA binding activity, explaining the previous observations. Thus, we describe a regulatory mechanism operating as a molecular switch, where in the absence of DNA damage, the FANCD2/FANCI complex is prevented from loading onto DNA, effectively suppressing the FA pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, affecting men more frequently and severely than women. Although recent studies suggest that differences in activity of the androgen receptor (AR) underlie the observed sex bias, little is known about AR activity in melanoma. Here we show that AR and EGR1 bind to the long non-coding RNA SLNCR and increase melanoma proliferation through coordinated transcriptional regulation of several growth-regulatory genes. ChIP-seq reveals that ligand-free AR is enriched on SLNCR-regulated melanoma genes and that AR genomic occupancy significantly overlaps with EGR1 at consensus EGR1 binding sites. We present a model in which SLNCR recruits AR to EGR1-bound genomic loci and switches EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation to repression of the tumor suppressor p21Waf1/Cip1. Our data implicate the regulatory triad of SLNCR, AR, and EGR1 in promoting oncogenesis and may help explain why men have a higher incidence of and more rapidly progressive melanomas compared with women.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) is a molecular technology based on proximity ligation that enables high-resolution and high-coverage inquiry of long-range looping interactions. Computational pipelines for analyzing 5C data involve a series of interdependent normalization procedures and statistical methods that markedly influence downstream biological results. A detailed analysis of the trade-offs inherent to all stages of 5C data analysis has not been reported. Here, we provide a comparative assessment of method performance at each step in the 5C analysis pipeline, including sequencing depth and library complexity correction, bias mitigation, spatial noise reduction, distance-dependent expected and variance estimation, statistical modeling, and loop detection. We discuss methodological advantages and disadvantages at each step and provide a full suite of algorithms, lib5C, to allow investigators to test the range of approaches on their own 5C data. Principles learned from our comparative analyses can be applied to protein-independent proximity ligation-based data, including Hi-C, 4C, and Capture-C.

Abstract: Summary
Natural sounds have rich spectrotemporal dynamics. Spectral information is spatially represented in the auditory cortex (ACX) via large-scale maps. However, the representation of temporal information, e.g., sound offset, is unclear. We perform multiscale imaging of neuronal and thalamic activity evoked by sound onset and offset in awake mouse ACX. ACX areas differed in onset responses (On-Rs) and offset responses (Off-Rs). Most excitatory L2/3 neurons show either On-Rs or Off-Rs, and ACX areas are characterized by differing fractions of On and Off-R neurons. Somatostatin and parvalbumin interneurons show distinct temporal dynamics, potentially amplifying Off-Rs. Functional network analysis shows that ACX areas contain distinct parallel onset and offset networks. Thalamic (MGB) terminals show either On-Rs or Off-Rs, indicating a thalamic origin of On and Off-R pathways. Thus, ACX areas spatially represent temporal features, and this representation is created by spatial convergence and co-activation of distinct MGB inputs and is refined by specific intracortical connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR and associated Cas proteins function as an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes to combat bacteriophage infection. During the immunization step, new spacers are acquired by the CRISPR machinery, but the molecular mechanism of spacer capture remains enigmatic. We show that the Cas9, Cas1, Cas2, and Csn2 proteins of a Streptococcus thermophilus type II-A CRISPR-Cas system form a complex and provide cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of three different assemblies. The predominant form, with the stoichiometry Cas18-Cas24-Csn28, referred to as monomer, contains ∼30 bp duplex DNA bound along a central channel. A minor species, termed a dimer, comprises two monomers that sandwich a further eight Cas1 and four Cas2 subunits and contains two DNA ∼30-bp duplexes within the channel. A filamentous form also comprises Cas18-Cas24-Csn28 units (typically 2–6) but with a different Cas1-Cas2 interface between them and a continuous DNA duplex running along a central channel.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons face the challenge of maintaining cellular homeostasis through lysosomal degradation. While enzymatically active degradative lysosomes are enriched in the soma, their axonal trafficking and positioning and impact on axonal physiology remain elusive. Here, we characterized axon-targeted delivery of degradative lysosomes by applying fluorescent probes that selectively label active forms of lysosomal cathepsins D, B, L, and GCase. By time-lapse imaging of cortical neurons in microfluidic devices and standard dishes, we reveal that soma-derived degradative lysosomes rapidly influx into distal axons and target to autophagosomes and Parkinson disease-related α-synuclein cargos for local degradation. Impairing lysosome axonal delivery induces an aberrant accumulation of autophagosomes and α-synuclein cargos in distal axons. Our study demonstrates that the axon is an active compartment for local degradation and reveals fundamental aspects of axonal lysosomal delivery and maintenance. Our work establishes a foundation for investigations into axonal lysosome trafficking and functionality in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Sex determination is a unique process that allows the study of multipotent progenitors and their acquisition of sex-specific fates during differentiation of the gonad into a testis or an ovary. Using time series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on ovarian Nr5a1-GFP+ somatic cells during sex determination, we identified a single population of early progenitors giving rise to both pre-granulosa cells and potential steroidogenic precursor cells. By comparing time series single-cell RNA sequencing of XX and XY somatic cells, we provide evidence that gonadal supporting cells are specified from these early progenitors by a non-sex-specific transcriptomic program before pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells acquire their sex-specific identity. In XX and XY steroidogenic precursors, similar transcriptomic profiles underlie the acquisition of cell fate but with XX cells exhibiting a relative delay. Our data provide an important resource, at single-cell resolution, for further interrogation of the molecular and cellular basis of mammalian sex determination.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian sirtuin, SIRT6, is a key tumor suppressor that maintains genome stability and regulates transcription, though how SIRT6 family members control genome stability is unclear. Here, we use multiple genome-wide approaches to demonstrate that the yeast SIRT6 homologs, Hst3 and Hst4, prevent genome instability by tuning levels of both coding and noncoding transcription. While nascent RNAs are elevated in the absence of Hst3 and Hst4, a global impact on steady-state mRNAs is masked by the nuclear exosome, indicating that sirtuins and the exosome provide two levels of regulation to maintain transcription homeostasis. We find that, in the absence of Hst3 and Hst4, increased transcription is associated with excessive DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loops) that appear to lead to new DNA double-strand breaks. Importantly, dissolution of R-loops suppresses the genome instability phenotypes of hst3 hst4 mutants, suggesting that the sirtuins maintain genome stability by acting as a rheostat to prevent promiscuous transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The decoration of proteins by carbohydrates is essential for eukaryotic life yet heterogeneous due to a lack of biosynthetic templates. This complex carbohydrate mixture—the glycan profile—is generated in the compartmentalized Golgi, in which level and localization of glycosylation enzymes are key determinants. Here, we develop and validate a computational model for glycan biosynthesis to probe how the biosynthetic machinery creates different glycan profiles. We combined stochastic modeling with Bayesian fitting that enables rigorous comparison to experimental data despite starting with uncertain initial parameters. This is an important development in the field of glycan modeling, which revealed biological insights about the glycosylation machinery in altered cellular states. We experimentally validated changes in N-linked glycan-modifying enzymes in cells with perturbed intra-Golgi-enzyme sorting and the predicted glycan-branching activity during osteogenesis. Our model can provide detailed information on altered biosynthetic paths, with potential for advancing treatments for glycosylation-related diseases and glyco-engineering of cells.

Abstract: Summary
Connexin43 (Cx43; gene name GJA1) is the most ubiquitously expressed gap junction protein, and understanding of its regulation largely falls under transcription and post-translational modification. In addition to Cx43, Gja1 mRNA encodes internally translated isoforms regulating gap junction formation, whose expression is modulated by TGF-β. Here, using RLM-RACE, we identify distinct Gja1 transcripts differing only in 5′ UTR length, of which two are upregulated during TGF-β exposure and hypoxia. Introduction of these transcripts into Gja1−/− cells phenocopies the response of Gja1 to TGF-β with reduced internal translation initiation. Inhibiting pathways downstream of TGF-β selectively regulates levels of Gja1 transcript isoforms and translation products. Reporter assays reveal enhanced translation of full-length Cx43 from shorter Gja1 5′ UTR isoforms. We also observe a correlation among UTR selection, translation, and reduced gap junction formation in aged heart tissue. These data elucidate a relationship between transcript isoform expression and translation initiation regulating intercellular communication.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in host antiviral defense by modulating immune responses. However, it remains largely unexplored how viruses exploit interferon (IFN)-independent host lncRNAs to facilitate viral replication. Here, we have identified a group of human lncRNAs that modulate influenza A virus (IAV) replication in a loss-of-function screen and found that an IFN-independent lncRNA, called IPAN, is hijacked by IAV to assist IAV replication. IPAN is specifically induced by IAV infection independently of IFN and associates with and stabilizes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase PB1, enabling efficient viral RNA synthesis. Silencing IPAN results in PB1 degradation and severely impairs viral infection. Therefore, our data unveil an important role of host lncRNAs in promoting viral replication by modulating viral protein stability. Our findings may open avenues to the development of antiviral therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Exquisite regulation of energy homeostasis protects from nutrient deprivation but causes metabolic dysfunction upon nutrient excess. In human and murine adipose tissue, the accumulation of ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) accompanies obesity, implicating this receptor in energy metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mice bearing global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager, the gene encoding RAGE, display superior metabolic recovery after fasting, a cold challenge, or high-fat feeding. The RAGE-dependent mechanisms were traced to suppression of protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its key targets, hormone-sensitive lipase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, upon β-adrenergic receptor stimulation—processes that dampen the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenic programs. This work identifies the innate role of RAGE as a key node in the immunometabolic networks that control responses to nutrient supply and cold challenges, and it unveils opportunities to harness energy expenditure in environmental and metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Common antivirals include nucleoside or nucleotide analogs with base prodrugs. The antiviral ribavirin, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nucleoside antimetabolite, halts guanine production, mutagenizes viral genomes, and activates interferon signaling. Here, we find that ribavirin induces spermidine-spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1), a polyamine catabolic enzyme. Polyamines are small, positively charged molecules involved in cellular functions such as transcription and translation. Previous work showed that SAT1 activation and polyamine depletion interfere with RNA virus replication. We show ribavirin depletes polyamines via SAT1, in conjunction with its known mechanisms. SAT1 transcripts, protein, and activity are induced in a dose-dependent manner, which depletes polyamine levels and reduces viral titers. Inhibition of SAT1 activity, pharmacologically or genetically, reduces ribavirin’s effectiveness against three virus infection models. Additionally, ribavirin-mediated polyamine depletion results from nucleotide pool depletion. These data demonstrate another mechanism of ribavirin that inform its clinical effectiveness, which may provide insight for improved therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The activity of the tumor suppressor p53 has to be timed and balanced closely to prevent untimely induction of cell death. The stability of p53 depends on the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 but also on Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones that interact with its DNA binding domain (DBD). Using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry and biochemical methods, we analyzed conformational states of wild-type p53-DBD at physiological temperatures and conformational perturbations in three frequent p53 cancer mutants. We demonstrate that the Hsp70/Hdj1 system shifts the conformational equilibrium of p53 toward a flexible, more mutant-like, DNA binding inactive state by binding to the DNA binding loop. The analyzed cancer mutants are likewise destabilized by interaction with the Hsp70/Hdj1 system. In contrast, Hsp90 protects the DBD of p53 wild-type and mutant proteins from unfolding. We propose that the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone systems assume complementary functions to optimally balance conformational plasticity with conformational stability.

Abstract: Summary
Small-cell neuroendocrine cancers (SCNCs) are an aggressive cancer subtype. Transdifferentiation toward an SCN phenotype has been reported as a resistance route in response to targeted therapies. Here, we identified a convergence to an SCN state that is widespread across epithelial cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. More broadly, non-SCN metastases have higher expression of SCN-associated transcription factors than non-SCN primary tumors. Drug sensitivity and gene dependency screens demonstrate that these convergent SCNCs have shared vulnerabilities. These common vulnerabilities are found across unannotated SCN-like epithelial cases, small-round-blue cell tumors, and unexpectedly in hematological malignancies. The SCN convergent phenotype and common sensitivity profiles with hematological cancers can guide treatment options beyond tissue-specific targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Epitope-targeted HIV vaccine design seeks to focus antibody responses to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites by sequential immunization. A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV immunization strategy. Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities. We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env. Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses. Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization. Overall, the chimpanzee MT145K trimer behaves as expected from design both in vitro and in vivo and is an attractive potential component of a sequential immunization regimen to induce V2-apex bnAbs.

Abstract: Summary
The tuberculosis (TB) bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and HIV-1 act synergistically; however, the mechanisms by which Mtb exacerbates HIV-1 pathogenesis are not well known. Using in vitro and ex vivo cell culture systems, we show that human M(IL-10) anti-inflammatory macrophages, present in TB-associated microenvironment, produce high levels of HIV-1. In vivo, M(IL-10) macrophages are expanded in lungs of co-infected non-human primates, which correlates with disease severity. Furthermore, HIV-1/Mtb co-infected patients display an accumulation of M(IL-10) macrophage markers (soluble CD163 and MerTK). These M(IL-10) macrophages form direct cell-to-cell bridges, which we identified as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) involved in viral transfer. TNT formation requires the IL-10/STAT3 signaling pathway, and targeted inhibition of TNTs substantially reduces the enhancement of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transfer and overproduction in M(IL-10) macrophages. Our study reveals that TNTs facilitate viral transfer and amplification, thereby promoting TNT formation as a mechanism to be explored in TB/AIDS potential therapeutics.

Chronic exposure to tumor-associated antigens inactivates cognate T cells, restricting the repertoire of tumor-specific effector T cells. This problem was studied here by transferring TCR transgenic CD4 T cells into recipient mice that constitutively express a cognate self-antigen linked to MHC II on CD11c-bearing cells. Immunotherapeutic agonists to CD134 plus CD137, “dual costimulation,” induces specific CD4 T cell expansion and expression of the receptor for the Th2-associated IL-1 family cytokine IL-33. Rather than producing IL-4, however, they express the tumoricidal Th1 cytokine IFNγ when stimulated with IL-33 or IL-36 (a related IL-1 family member) plus IL-12 or IL-2. IL-36, which is induced within B16-F10 melanomas by dual costimulation, reduces tumor growth when injected intratumorally as a monotherapy and boosts the efficacy of tumor-nonspecific dual costimulated CD4 T cells. Dual costimulation thus enables chronic antigen-exposed CD4 T cells, regardless of tumor specificity, to elaborate tumoricidal function in response to tumor-associated cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitory synapses mediate the majority of synaptic inhibition in the brain, thereby controlling neuronal excitability, firing, and plasticity. Although essential for neuronal function, the central question of how these synapses are organized at the subsynaptic level remains unanswered. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution microscopy to image key components of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain and presynaptic terminal, revealing that inhibitory synapses are organized into nanoscale subsynaptic domains (SSDs) of the gephyrin scaffold, GABAARs and the active-zone protein Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM). Gephyrin SSDs cluster GABAAR SSDs, demonstrating nanoscale architectural interdependence between scaffold and receptor. GABAAR SSDs strongly associate with active-zone RIM SSDs, indicating an important role for GABAAR nanoscale organization near sites of GABA release. Finally, we find that in response to elevated activity, synapse growth is mediated by an increase in the number of postsynaptic SSDs, suggesting a modular mechanism for increasing inhibitory synaptic strength.

Abstract: Summary
Citrullination, the deimination of peptidylarginine residues into peptidylcitrulline, has been implicated in the etiology of several diseases. In multiple sclerosis, citrullination is thought to be a major driver of pathology through hypercitrullination and destabilization of myelin. As such, inhibition of citrullination has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for MS. Here, in contrast, we show that citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) contributes to normal oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and motor function. We identify several targets for PAD2, including myelin and chromatin-related proteins, implicating PAD2 in epigenomic regulation. Accordingly, we observe that PAD2 inhibition and its knockdown affect chromatin accessibility and prevent the upregulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation genes. Moreover, mice lacking PAD2 display motor dysfunction and a decreased number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum. We conclude that citrullination contributes to proper oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelination.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced dietary protein intake induces adaptive physiological changes in macronutrient preference, energy expenditure, growth, and glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that deletion of the FGF21 co-receptor βKlotho (Klb) from the brain produces mice that are unable to mount a physiological response to protein restriction, an effect that is replicated by whole-body deletion of FGF21. Mice forced to consume a low-protein diet exhibit reduced growth, increased energy expenditure, and a resistance to diet-induced obesity, but the loss of FGF21 signaling in the brain completely abrogates that response. When given access to a higher protein alternative, protein-restricted mice exhibit a shift toward protein-containing foods, and central FGF21 signaling is essential for that response. FGF21 is an endocrine signal linking the liver and brain, which regulates adaptive, homeostatic changes in metabolism and feeding behavior during protein restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain lifelong hematopoiesis by remaining quiescent in the bone marrow niche. Recapitulation of a quiescent state in culture has not been achieved, as cells rapidly proliferate and differentiate in vitro. After exhaustive analysis of different environmental factor combinations and concentrations as a way to mimic physiological conditions, we were able to maintain engraftable quiescent HSCs for 1 month in culture under very low cytokine concentrations, hypoxia, and very high fatty acid levels. Exogenous fatty acids were required likely due to suppression of intrinsic fatty acid synthesis by hypoxia and low cytokine conditions. By contrast, high cytokine concentrations or normoxia induced HSC proliferation and differentiation. Our culture system provides a means to evaluate properties of steady-state HSCs and test effects of defined factors in vitro under near-physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. Reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. Here we show that reduced autophagy is a central molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence. Autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphocytes, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, an endogenous polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which is essential for the synthesis of the autophagy transcription factor TFEB. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Spermidine supplementation restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, which can be harnessed to reverse immune senescence in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Anabolic resistance and impaired myocellular quality contribute to age-related sarcopenia, which exacerbates with obesity. Diet-induced muscle mass loss is attenuated by resistance or aerobic plus resistance exercise compared to aerobic exercise in obese elderly. We assessed chronic effects of weight loss plus different exercise modalities on muscle protein synthesis response to feeding and myocellular quality. Obese older adults were randomized to a weight-management program plus aerobic, resistance, or combined aerobic and resistance exercise or to control. Participants underwent vastus lateralis biopsies at baseline and 6 months. Muscle protein synthesis rate increased more in resistance and combined than in control. Autophagy mediators’ expression decreased more in combined than in aerobic, which experienced a higher increase in inflammation and mitochondrial regulators’ expression. In obese elderly, combined aerobic and resistance exercise is superior to either mode independently for improving muscle protein synthesis and myocellular quality, thereby maintaining muscle mass during weight-loss therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The teratogenic potential of Zika virus (ZIKV) has made the development of an effective vaccine a global health priority. Here, we generate two gorilla adenovirus-based ZIKV vaccines that encode for pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins (GAd-Zvp) or prM and the ectodomain of E protein (GAd-Eecto). Both vaccines induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and prevent lethality after ZIKV challenge in mice. Protection is antibody dependent, CD8+ T cell independent, and for GAd-Eecto requires the complement component C1q. Immunization of GAd-Zvp induces antibodies against a key neutralizing epitope on domain III of E protein and confers durable protection as evidenced by memory B and long-lived plasma cell responses and challenge studies 9 months later. In two models of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, GAd-Zvp prevents maternal-to-fetal transmission. The gorilla adenovirus-based vaccine platform encoding full-length prM and E genes is a promising candidate for preventing congenital ZIKV syndrome and possibly infection by other flaviviruses.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS) clonally evolves from transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), a preleukemic condition in DS newborns. To define mechanisms of leukemic transformation, we combined exome and targeted resequencing of 111 TAM and 141 ML-DS samples with functional analyses. TAM requires trisomy 21 and truncating mutations in GATA1; additional TAM variants are usually not pathogenic. By contrast, in ML-DS, clonal and subclonal variants are functionally required. We identified a recurrent and oncogenic hotspot gain-of-function mutation in myeloid cytokine receptor CSF2RB. By a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an in vivo murine TAM model, we tested loss-of-function of 22 recurrently mutated ML-DS genes. Loss of 18 different genes produced leukemias that phenotypically, genetically, and transcriptionally mirrored ML-DS.

Abstract: Summary
Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems contain programmable single-effector RNA-guided RNases, including Cas13b, one of the four known family members. Cas13b, which has been used for both RNA editing and nucleic acid detection, is unique among type VI CRISPR effectors in its linear domain architecture and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. Here, we report the crystal structure of Prevotella buccae Cas13b (PbuCas13b) bound to crRNA at 1.65 Å resolution. This structure, combined with biochemical experiments assaying the stability, kinetics, and function of Cas13b, provides a mechanistic model for Cas13b target RNA recognition and identifies features responsible for target and cleavage specificity. Based on these observations, we generated Cas13b variants with altered cleavage preferences, which may expand the utility of nuclease-based RNA detection assays and other applications of Cas13b in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Whether cell forces or extracellular matrix (ECM) can impact genome integrity is largely unclear. Here, acute perturbations (∼1 h) to actomyosin stress or ECM elasticity cause rapid and reversible changes in lamin-A, DNA damage, and cell cycle. The findings are especially relevant to organs such as the heart because DNA damage permanently arrests cardiomyocyte proliferation shortly after birth and thereby eliminates regeneration after injury including heart attack. Embryonic hearts, cardiac-differentiated iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells), and various nonmuscle cell types all show that actomyosin-driven nuclear rupture causes cytoplasmic mis-localization of DNA repair factors and excess DNA damage. Binucleation and micronuclei increase as telomeres shorten, which all favor cell-cycle arrest. Deficiencies in lamin-A and repair factors exacerbate these effects, but lamin-A-associated defects are rescued by repair factor overexpression and also by contractility modulators in clinical trials. Contractile cells on stiff ECM normally exhibit low phosphorylation and slow degradation of lamin-A by matrix-metalloprotease-2 (MMP2), and inhibition of this lamin-A turnover and also actomyosin contractility are seen to minimize DNA damage. Lamin-A is thus stress stabilized to mechano-protect the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Neocortex expansion during mammalian evolution has been linked to an increase in proliferation of basal progenitors in the subventricular zone. Here, we explored a potential role of YAP, the major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, in proliferation of basal progenitors. YAP expression and activity are high in ferret and human basal progenitors, which exhibit high proliferative capacity, but low in mouse basal progenitors, which lack such capacity. Conditional expression of a constitutively active YAP in mouse basal progenitors resulted in increased proliferation of basal progenitor and promoted production of upper-layer neurons. Pharmacological and genetic interference with YAP function in ferret and human developing neocortex resulted in decreased abundance of cycling basal progenitors. Together, our data indicate that YAP is necessary and sufficient to promote the proliferation of basal progenitors and suggest that increases in YAP levels and presumably activity contributed to the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex.

Abstract: Summary
Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a cellular antiviral restriction factor that prevents early events in retrovirus replication. The activity of TRIM5α is thought to be limited to retroviruses as a result of highly specific interactions with capsid lattices. In contrast to this current understanding, we show that both human and rhesus macaque TRIM5α suppress replication of specific flaviviruses. Multiple viruses in the tick-borne encephalitis complex are sensitive to TRIM5α-dependent restriction, but mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses, are resistant. TRIM5α suppresses replication by binding to the viral protease NS2B/3 to promote its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, TRIM5α contributes to the antiviral function of IFN-I against sensitive flaviviruses in human cells. Thus, TRIM5α possesses remarkable plasticity in the recognition of diverse virus families, with the potential to influence human susceptibility to emerging flaviviruses of global concern.

Abstract: Summary
Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein that facilitates Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol to the ER. SERCA2b includes a characteristic 11th transmembrane helix (TM11) followed by a luminal tail, but the structural basis of SERCA regulation by these C-terminal segments remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of SERCA2b and its C-terminal splicing variant SERCA2a, both in the E1-2Ca2+-adenylyl methylenediphosphonate (AMPPCP) state. Despite discrepancies with the previously reported structural model of SERCA2b, TM11 was found to be located adjacent to TM10 and to interact weakly with a part of the L8/9 loop and the N-terminal end of TM10, thereby inhibiting the SERCA2b catalytic cycle. Accordingly, mutational disruption of the interactions between TM11 and its neighboring residues caused SERCA2b to display SERCA2a-like ATPase activity. We propose that TM11 serves as a key modulator of SERCA2b activity by fine-tuning the intramolecular interactions with other transmembrane regions.

Abstract: Summary
The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in the oxidative stress response; however, the identity of the reactive oxygen species sensor within Keap1 remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a Keap1 mutant lacking 11 cysteine residues retains the ability to target Nrf2 for degradation, but it is unable to respond to cysteine-reactive Nrf2 inducers. Of the 11 mutated cysteine residues, we find that 4 (Cys226/613/622/624) are important for sensing hydrogen peroxide. Our analyses of multiple mutant mice lines, complemented by MEFs expressing a series of Keap1 mutants, reveal that Keap1 uses the cysteine residues redundantly to set up an elaborate fail-safe mechanism in which specific combinations of these four cysteine residues can form a disulfide bond to sense hydrogen peroxide. This sensing mechanism is distinct from that used for electrophilic Nrf2 inducers, demonstrating that Keap1 is equipped with multiple cysteine-based sensors to detect various endogenous and exogenous stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Sugars and refined carbohydrates are major components of the modern diet. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is upregulated in adipocytes in response to carbohydrate consumption and generates acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for both lipid synthesis and acetylation reactions. Here, we investigate the role of ACLY in the metabolic and transcriptional responses to carbohydrates in adipocytes and unexpectedly uncover a sexually dimorphic function in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. When fed a high-sucrose diet, AclyFAT−/− females exhibit a lipodystrophy-like phenotype, with minimal fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and hepatic lipid accumulation, whereas AclyFAT−/− males have only mild metabolic phenotypes. We find that ACLY is crucial for nutrient-dependent carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) activation in adipocytes and plays a key role, particularly in females, in the storage of newly synthesized fatty acids in adipose tissue. The data indicate that adipocyte ACLY is important in females for the systemic handling of dietary carbohydrates and for the preservation of metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage activates checkpoints that limit the replicative potential of stem cells, including differentiation. These checkpoints protect against cancer development but also promote tissue aging. Because mice lacking Slug/Snai2 exhibit limited stem cell activity, including luminobasal differentiation, and are protected from mammary cancer, we reasoned that Slug might regulate DNA damage checkpoints in mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that Slug facilitates efficient execution of RPA32-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Slug deficiency leads to delayed phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and its effectors RPA32 and CHK1. This leads to impaired RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage sites and persistence of unresolved DNA damage. In vivo, Slug/Snai2 loss leads to increased DNA damage and premature aging of mammary epithelium. Collectively, our work demonstrates that the mammary stem cell regulator Slug controls DDR checkpoints by dually inhibiting differentiation and facilitating DDR repair, and its loss causes unresolved DNA damage and accelerated aging.

During infection, IL-1β production occurs in parallel with the onset of innate antimicrobial defenses, but the contribution of IL-1β signaling to cell-intrinsic immunity is not defined. Here, we report that exogenous IL-1β induces interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation in human myeloid, fibroblast, and epithelial cells. IRF3 activation by IL-1β is dependent upon the DNA-sensing pathway adaptor, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), through the recognition of cytosolic mtDNA by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS). IL-1β treatment results in interferon (IFN) production and activation of IFN signaling to direct a potent innate immune response that restricts dengue virus infection. This study identifies a new function for IL-1β in the onset or enhancement of cell-intrinsic immunity, with important implications for cGAS-STING in integrating inflammatory and microbial cues for host defense.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes control mRNA processing, translation, and decay. Transcripts in these complexes localize to specific regions of the cell and can condense into non-membrane-bound structures such as stress granules. It has proven challenging to map the RNA composition of these large and dynamic structures, however. We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq, which uses the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome. We show that APEX-seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS), obtained precisely in parallel, provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs and unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition. Our novel technique allows a powerful and general approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules.

Abstract: Summary
The past is the best predictor of the future. This simple postulate belies the complex neurobiological mechanisms that facilitate an individual’s use of memory to guide decisions. Previous research has shown integration of memories bias decision-making. Alternatively, memories can prospectively guide our choices. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms and timing of hippocampal (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and striatal contributions during prospective memory-guided decision-making. We develop an associative learning task in which the correct choice is conditional on the preceding stimulus. Two distinct networks emerge: (1) a prospective circuit consisting of the HPC, putamen, mPFC, and other cortical regions, which exhibit increased activation preceding successful conditional decisions and (2) a concurrent circuit comprising the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and additional cortical structures that engage during the execution of correct conditional choices. Our findings demonstrate distinct neurobiological circuits through which memory prospectively biases decisions and influences choice execution.

Abstract: Summary
Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting are known to prolong life- and healthspan in model organisms, while their effects on humans are less well studied. In a randomized controlled trial study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02673515), we show that 4 weeks of strict alternate day fasting (ADF) improved markers of general health in healthy, middle-aged humans while causing a 37% calorie reduction on average. No adverse effects occurred even after >6 months. ADF improved cardiovascular markers, reduced fat mass (particularly the trunk fat), improving the fat-to-lean ratio, and increased β-hydroxybutyrate, even on non-fasting days. On fasting days, the pro-aging amino-acid methionine, among others, was periodically depleted, while polyunsaturated fatty acids were elevated. We found reduced levels sICAM-1 (an age-associated inflammatory marker), low-density lipoprotein, and the metabolic regulator triiodothyronine after long-term ADF. These results shed light on the physiological impact of ADF and supports its safety. ADF could eventually become a clinically relevant intervention.

Abstract: Summary
In the negative feedback loop driving fungal and animal circadian oscillators, negative elements (FREQUENCY [FRQ], PERIODS [PERs], and CRYPTOCHROMES [CRYs]) are understood to inhibit their own expression, in part by promoting the phosphorylation of their heterodimeric transcriptional activators (e.g., White Collar-1 [WC-1]-WC-2 [White Collar complex; WCC] and BMAL1/Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput [CLOCK]). However, correlations between heterodimer activity and phosphorylation are weak, contradictions exist, and mechanistic details are almost wholly lacking. We report mapping of 80 phosphosites on WC-1 and 15 on WC-2 and elucidation of the time-of-day-specific code, requiring both a group of phosphoevents on WC-1 and two distinct clusters on WC-2, that governs circadian repression, leading to feedback loop closure. Combinatorial control via phosphorylation also governs rhythmic WCC binding to the promoters of clock-controlled genes mediating the essential first step in circadian output, a group encoding both transcription factors and signaling proteins. These data provide a basic mechanistic understanding for fundamental events underlying circadian negative feedback and output, key aspects of circadian biology.

Abstract: Summary
Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for neuronal function. Neurons utilize microtubule-dependent molecular motors to allocate proteasomes to synapses, but how proteasomes are coupled to motors and how this is regulated to meet changing demand for protein breakdown remain largely unknown. We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). The inactivation of PI31 inhibited proteasome motility in axons and disrupted synaptic proteostasis, structure, and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 by p38 MAPK enhanced binding to DYNLL1/2 and promoted the directional movement of proteasomes in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motors. Inactivation of PI31 in mouse neurons attenuated proteasome movement in axons, indicating this process is conserved. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may contribute to these disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells encounter a myriad of physical cues upon arrest and extravasation in capillary beds. Here, we examined the role of physical factors in non-random organ colonization using a zebrafish xenograft model. We observed a two-step process by which mammalian mammary tumor cells showed non-random organ colonization. Initial homing was driven by vessel architecture, where greater numbers of cells became arrested in the topographically disordered blood vessels of the caudal vascular plexus (CVP) than in the linear vessels in the brain. Following arrest, bone-marrow- and brain-tropic clones exhibited organ-specific patterns of extravasation. Extravasation was mediated by β1 integrin, where knockdown of β1 integrin reduced extravasation in the CVP but did not affect extravasation of a brain-tropic clone in the brain. In contrast, silencing myosin 1B redirected early colonization from the brain to the CVP. Our results suggest that organ selectivity is driven by both vessel topography and cell-type-dependent extravasation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes function as tumor suppressors in increasing contexts. In contrast to oncogenic kinases, whose function is acutely regulated by transient phosphorylation, PKC is constitutively phosphorylated following biosynthesis to yield a stable, autoinhibited enzyme that is reversibly activated by second messengers. Here, we report that the phosphatase PHLPP1 opposes PKC phosphorylation during maturation, leading to the degradation of aberrantly active species that do not become autoinhibited. Cancer-associated hotspot mutations in the pseudosubstrate of PKCβ that impair autoinhibition result in dephosphorylated and unstable enzymes. Protein-level analysis reveals that PKCα is fully phosphorylated at the PHLPP site in over 5,000 patient tumors, with higher PKC levels correlating (1) inversely with PHLPP1 levels and (2) positively with improved survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Thus, PHLPP1 provides a proofreading step that maintains the fidelity of PKC autoinhibition and reveals a prominent loss-of-function mechanism in cancer by suppressing the steady-state levels of PKC.

Abstract: Summary
In the bone marrow, CXCL12 and IL-7 are essential for B cell differentiation, whereas hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance requires SCF and CXCL12. Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1−/− mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells. Thus, a multispecific niche exists in mouse and human supporting both early progenitors and committed hematopoietic lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation, epithelial cell regeneration, macrophage polarization, and gut microbial homeostasis are critical for the pathological processes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a key component of the Hippo pathway and was recently suggested to promote epithelial cell regeneration for IBD recovery. However, it is unclear how YAP regulates macrophage polarization, inflammation, and gut microbial homeostasis. Although YAP has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and alleviate IBD, here we show that YAP in macrophages aggravates IBD, accompanied by the production of antimicrobial peptides and changes in gut microbiota. YAP impairs interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13-induced M2 macrophage polarization while promoting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon γ (IFN-γ)-triggered M1 macrophage activation for IL-6 production. In addition, YAP expression is differently regulated during the induction of M2 versus M1 macrophages. This study suggests that fully understanding the multiple functions of YAP in different cell types is crucial for IBD therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) provide the reservoir of regenerative cells to produce new adipocytes, although their identity in humans remains elusive. Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling, and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APC subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. Adipocytes derived from APCs with high CD34 expression exhibit exceedingly high rates of lipid flux compared with APCs with low or no CD34 expression, while adipocytes produced from CD34− APCs display beige-like adipocyte properties and a unique endocrine profile. APCs were more abundant in gluteofemoral compared with abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues, and the distribution of APC subtypes varies between depots and in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity of human white adipose tissue and a potential basis for dysregulated adipocyte function in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionarily related deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) USP25 and USP28 comprise an identical overall domain architecture but are functionally non-redundant: USP28 stabilizes c-MYC and other nuclear proteins, and USP25 regulates inflammatory TRAF signaling. We here compare molecular features of USP25 and USP28. Active enzymes form distinctively shaped dimers, with a dimerizing insertion spatially separating independently active catalytic domains. In USP25, but not USP28, two dimers can form an autoinhibited tetramer, where a USP25-specific, conserved insertion sequence blocks ubiquitin binding. In full-length enzymes, a C-terminal domain with a previously unknown fold has no impact on oligomerization, but N-terminal regions affect the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in vitro. We confirm oligomeric states of USP25 and USP28 in cells and show that modulating oligomerization affects substrate stabilization in accordance with in vitro activity data. Our work highlights how regions outside of the catalytic domain enable a conceptually intriguing interplay of DUB oligomerization and activity.

Abstract: Summary
Coordinated motor behaviors depend on feedback communication between peripheral sensory systems and central circuits in the brain and spinal cord. Relay of muscle- and tendon-derived sensory information to the CNS is facilitated by functionally and anatomically diverse groups of spinocerebellar tract neurons (SCTNs), but the molecular logic by which SCTN diversity and connectivity is achieved is poorly understood. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic manipulations to define the mechanisms governing the molecular profile and organization of SCTN subtypes. We found that SCTNs relaying proprioceptive sensory information from limb and axial muscles are generated through segmentally restricted actions of specific Hox genes. Loss of Hox function disrupts SCTN-subtype-specific transcriptional programs, leading to defects in the connections between proprioceptive sensory neurons, SCTNs, and the cerebellum. These results indicate that Hox-dependent genetic programs play essential roles in the assembly of neural circuits necessary for communication between the brain and spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarization is important for various biological processes. However, its regulation, particularly initiation, is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated mechanisms by which neutrophils break their symmetry and initiate their cytoskeleton polarization from an apolar state in circulation for their extravasation during inflammation. We show here that a local increase in plasma membrane (PM) curvature resulting from cell contact to a surface triggers the initial breakage of the symmetry of an apolar neutrophil and is required for subsequent polarization events induced by chemical stimulation. This local increase in PM curvature recruits SRGAP2 via its F-BAR domain, which in turn activates PI4KA and results in PM PtdIns4P polarization. Polarized PM PtdIns4P is targeted by RPH3A, which directs PIP5K1C90 and subsequent phosphorylated myosin light chain polarization, and this polarization signaling axis regulates neutrophil firm attachment to endothelium. Thus, this study reveals a mechanism for the initiation of cell cytoskeleton polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are prevalent in eukaryotic cells and viral genomes. Mammalian cells possess innate immunity to detect foreign circRNAs, but the molecular basis of self versus foreign identity in circRNA immunity is unknown. Here, we show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification on human circRNAs inhibits innate immunity. Foreign circRNAs are potent adjuvants to induce antigen-specific T cell activation, antibody production, and anti-tumor immunity in vivo, and m6A modification abrogates immune gene activation and adjuvant activity. m6A reader YTHDF2 sequesters m6A-circRNA and is essential for suppression of innate immunity. Unmodified circRNA, but not m6A-modified circRNA, directly activates RNA pattern recognition receptor RIG-I in the presence of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chain to cause filamentation of the adaptor protein MAVS and activation of the downstream transcription factor IRF3. CircRNA immunity has considerable parallel to prokaryotic DNA restriction modification system that transforms nucleic acid chemical modification into organismal innate immunity.
