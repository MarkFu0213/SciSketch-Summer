Abstract: High-fat diet-induced obesity detrimentally affects brain function by inducing chronic low-grade inflammation. This neuroinflammation is, at least in part, likely to be mediated by microglia, which are the main immune cell population in the brain. Microglia express a wide range of lipid-sensitive receptors and their activity can be modulated by fatty acids that cross the blood-brain barrier. Here, by combining live cell imaging and FRET technology we assessed how different fatty acids modulate microglia activity. We demonstrate that the combined action of fructose and palmitic acid induce Ikβα degradation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit nuclear factor kB (NF-κB) in HCM3 human microglia. Such obesogenic nutrients also lead to reactive oxygen species production and LynSrc activation (critical regulators of microglia inflammation). Importantly, short-time exposure to omega-3 (EPA and DHA), CLA and CLNA are sufficient to abolish NF-κB pathway activation, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role. Omega-3 and CLA also show an antioxidant potential by inhibiting reactive oxygen species production, and the activation of LynSrc in microglia. Furthermore, using chemical agonists (TUG-891) and antagonists (AH7614) of GPR120/FFA4, we demonstrated that omega-3, CLA and CLNA inhibition of the NF-κB pathway is mediated by this receptor, while omega-3 and CLA antioxidant potential occurs through different signaling mechanisms.

Abstract: 12α-Hydroxylated (12αOH) bile acids (BAs) selectively increase with high-fat diet intake. Dietary supplementation with cholic acid (CA) in rats is a possible strategy to reveal the causal link between 12αOH BAs and hepatic steatosis. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic mechanism underlying the effect of 12αOH BAs on hepatic steatosis. Male WKAH rats were fed either a control (Ct) or CA-supplemented diet (0.5 g/kg). After the 12-week intervention, the CA diet elevated the 12αOH BA levels in the gut–liver axis. CA-fed rats showed greater hepatic lipid accumulation than in the Ct group, regardless of the dietary energy balance. Untargeted metabolomics suggested marked differences in the fecal metabolome of rats subjected to the CA diet compared with that of Ct, characterized by the depletion of fatty acids and enrichment of amino acids and amines. Moreover, the liver metabolome differed in the CA group, characterized by an alteration in redox-related pathways. The CA diet elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consumption owing to the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, resulting in impaired peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α signaling in the liver. The CA diet increased sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and enhanced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, suggesting promotion of the pentose phosphate pathway that generates reducing equivalents. Integrated analysis of the gut–liver metabolomic data revealed the role of deoxycholic acid and its liver counterpart in mediating these metabolic alterations. These observations suggest that alterations in metabolites induced by 12αOH BAs in the gut–liver axis contribute to the enhancement of liver lipid accumulation.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder worldwide and a risk factor for obesity and diabetes. Emerging evidence has shown that ferroptosis is involved in the progression of NAFLD. Zeaxanthin (ZEA) is a carotenoid found in human serum. It has been reported that ZEA can ameliorate obesity, prevent age-related macular degeneration, and protect against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, no study has focused on the protective effects of ZEA against NAFLD. In this study, free fatty acid (FFA) induced HepG2 cells were used as a cell model for NAFLD. Our results suggest that ZEA exerts antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. Moreover, ZEA acted as a ferroptosis inhibitor, significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and iron overload and improving mitochondrial dysfunction in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In addition, ZEA downregulated the expression of p53 and modulated downstream targets, such as GPX4, SLC7A11, SAT1, and ALOX15, which contributed to the reduction in cellular lipid peroxidation. Our findings suggest that ZEA has the potential for NAFLD intervention.

Abstract: Of the long-chain bases (LCBs) that comprise the ceramides (CERs) present in mammals, only 4,14-sphingadiene (sphingadiene; SPD) has a cis double bond (at C14). Because of this unique structure, the metabolism of SPD may differ from that of other LCBs, but whether this is the case remains unclear. FADS3 is responsible for introducing the cis double bond in SPD. However, the substrate specificity of FADS3 and cofactors involved in the FADS3-catalyzed reaction are also unknown. In the present study, a cell-based assay using a ceramide synthase inhibitor and an in vitro experiment showed that FADS3 is active toward sphingosine (SPH)-containing CERs (SPH-CERs) but not toward free SPH. FADS3 exhibits specificity with respect to the chain length of the SPH moiety of SPH-CERs (active toward C16–20), but not that of the fatty acid moiety. Furthermore, FADS3 is active toward straight-chain and iso‐branched-chain SPH-containing CERs but not toward anteiso-branched forms. In addition to SPH-CERs, FADS3 also shows activity toward dihydrosphingosine-containing CERs, but this activity is approximately half of that toward SPH-CERs. It uses either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor, and the electron transfer is facilitated by cytochrome b5. The metabolic flow of SPD to sphingomyelin is predominant over that to glycosphingolipids. In the metabolic pathway from SPD to fatty acids, the chain length of the SPD is reduced by two carbons and the trans double bond at C4 is saturated. This study thus elucidates the enzymatic properties of FADS3 and the metabolism of SPD.

Abstract: Methylthio-DADMe-immucillin-A (MTDIA) is an 86 picomolar inhibitor of 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) with potent and specific anti-cancer efficacy. MTAP salvages S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) from 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a toxic metabolite produced during polyamine biosynthesis. Changes in MTAP expression are implicated in cancer growth and development, making MTAP an appealing target for anti-cancer therapeutics. Since SAM is involved in lipid metabolism, we hypothesised that MTDIA alters the lipidomes of MTDIA-treated cells. To identify these effects, we analysed the lipid profiles of MTDIA-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae using ultra-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHRAMS). MTAP inhibition by MTDIA, and knockout of the Meu1 gene that encodes for MTAP in yeast, caused global lipidomic changes and differential abundance of lipids involved in cell signaling. The phosphoinositide kinase/phosphatase signaling network was specifically impaired upon MTDIA treatment, and was independently validated and further characterised via altered localization of proteins integral to this network. Functional consequences of dysregulated lipid metabolism included a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by MTDIA that was contemporaneous with changes in immunological response factors (nitric oxide, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10) in mammalian cells. These results indicate that lipid homeostasis alterations and concomitant downstream effects may be associated with MTDIA mechanistic efficacy.

Abstract: Plasmalogens (Pls) are vinyl-ether bond-containing glycerophospholipids or glycosyl diradyl glycerols, and are of great importance in the physiological functions and stability of cell membrane. Here, we identified and characterized that the plasmalogen synthase MeHAD from anaerobic Megasphaera elsdenii was responsible for vinyl-ether bond formation. Different from the 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (HAD) family plasmalogen synthase PlsA-PlsR which are encoded by two genes in Clostridium perfringens, the HAD homolog (MeHAD) encoded by a single gene MELS_0169 was found in M. elsdenii. By heterologous expression of the MeHAD gene into a nonplasmalogen-producing Escherichia coli strain, the expressed MeHAD was found to be located in the cell membrane region. Plasmalogens were detected in the recombinant strain using GC–MS and LC-MS, demonstrating that MeHAD was the key enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis. Moreover, the synthesized plasmalogens could enhance the oxidative stress-resistance and osmotic pressure-resistance of the recombinant strain, probably due to the ROS scavenging and decreased membrane permeability by the plasmalogens, respectively. The four-cysteine (Cys125, Cys164, Cys445 and Cys484) site-mutant of MeHAD, which were predicted binding to the [4Fe-4S] cluster, was unable to synthesize plasmalogens, indicating that the cysteines are important for the catalytic activity of MeHAD. Our results revealed the single gene encoded plasmalogen synthase in M. elsdenii and established a recombinant E. coli strain with plasmalogen production potential.

Abstract: Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1, a marine thraustochytrid, has been regarded as a potential candidate as a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) producer. Even though the genomics of Aurantiochytrium sp. are available, the metabolic responses at a systems level are largely unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the global metabolic responses to DHA production in Aurantiochytrium sp. through transcriptome and genome-scale network-driven analysis. Of a total of 13,505 genes, 2527 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Aurantiochytrium sp., unravelling the transcriptional regulations behinds lipid and DHA accumulation. The highest number of DEG were found for pairwise comparison between growth phase and lipid accumulating phase where a total of 1435 genes were down-regulated with 869 genes being up-regulated. These uncovered several metabolic pathways that contributing in DHA and lipid accumulation including amino acid and acetate metabolism which involve in the generation of crucial precursors. Upon applying network-driven analysis, hydrogen sulphide was found as potential reporter metabolite that could be associated with the genes related to acetyl-CoA synthesis for DHA production. Our findings suggest that the transcriptional regulation of these pathways is a ubiquitous feature in response to specific cultivation phases during DHA overproduction in Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1.

Abstract: IL-6, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-1β are the crucial cytokines controlling inflammatory and immune response during L. major infection. During cutaneous leishmaniasis, an important T helper cell type CD4+ Th17 subset plays a deterministic role in lesion formation through channelling infected macrophages and production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23 and IFN-γ. Ceramide derived sphingosine precursors may assist in pro-inflammatory cytokine response. However, the role of these metabolites in inflammation with pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokines in L. major infection is unknown. The present study indicates IL-6/IL-17/IL-23 and SPHK1-S1P-S1PRs signaling axes with the overexpression of SATB1 aiding in disease progression. Targeting SATB1 might modulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune functioning, thereby killing the intracellular parasite. Systems immunological methods assisted in a step towards identifying the key to the mystery of crucial components and serving as an approach for therapeutic intervention in L. major infection.

Abstract: Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, its impact on non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remains largely unknown. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) is essential for the hydrolysis of circulating triglycerides and loss of functional GPIHBP1 causes severe HTG. In this study, we used Gpihbp1 knockout (GKO) mice to investigate the potential effects of HTG on non-atherosclerotic vascular remodeling. We compared the aortic morphology and gene expressions between three-month-old and ten-month-old GKO mice and their age-matched wild-type controls. We also conducted similar comparisons between GKO mice and wild-type controls in an angiotensin II (AngII)-induced vascular remodeling model. Our data showed that the intima-media wall of ten-month-old GKO mice but not three-month-olds was significantly thickened compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, ten-month-old GKO mice but not three-month-olds had increased aortic macrophage infiltration and perivascular fibrosis, along with increased endothelial activation and oxidative stress. Similarly, the AngII-induced vascular remodeling, as well as endothelial activation and oxidative stress, were also exacerbated in the GKO mice compared to wild-type controls. In conclusion, we demonstrated that severe HTG caused by Gpihbp1 deficiency could facilitate the onset and progression of non-atherosclerotic vascular remodeling through endothelial activation and oxidative stress in mice.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a key role in the regulation of protein folding, lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and serves as a primary site of sphingolipid biosynthesis. ER stress (ER dysfunction) participates in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction during aging. Mitochondria are in close contact with the ER through shared mitochondria associated membranes (MAM). Alteration of sphingolipids contributes to mitochondria-driven cell injury. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that is critical to maintain enzyme activity in the electron transport chain. The aim of the current study was to characterize the changes in sphingolipids and cardiolipin in ER, MAM, and mitochondria during the progression of aging in young (3 mo.), middle (18 mo.), and aged (24 mo.) C57Bl/6 mouse hearts. ER stress increased in hearts from 18 mo. mice and mice exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction by 24 mo. Hearts were pooled to isolate ER, MAM, and subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM). LC-MS/MS quantification of lipid content showed that aging increased ceramide content in ER and MAM. In addition, the contents of sphingomyelin and monohexosylceramides are also increased in the ER from aged mice. Aging increased the total cardiolipin content in the ER. Aging did not alter the total cardiolipin content in mitochondria or MAM yet altered the composition of cardiolipin with aging in line with increased oxidative stress compared to young mice. These results indicate that alteration of sphingolipids can contribute to the ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs during aging.

Abstract: Recent trials have reported the ability of triheptanoin to improve clinical outcomes for the severe symptoms associated with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, including very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. However, the milder myopathic symptoms are still challenging to treat satisfactorily. Myopathic pathogenesis is multifactorial, but oxidative stress is an important component. We have previously shown that metabolic stress increases the oxidative burden in VLCAD-deficient cell lines and can deplete the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). We investigated whether medium-chain fatty acids provide protection against GSH depletion during metabolic stress in VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts. To investigate the effect of differences in anaplerotic capacity, we included both even-(octanoate) and odd-numbered (heptanoate) medium-chain fatty acids. Overall, we show that modulation of the concentration of medium-chain fatty acids in culture media affects levels of GSH retained during metabolic stress in VLCAD-deficient cell lines but not in controls. Lowered glutamine concentration in the culture media during metabolic stress led to GSH depletion and decreased viability in VLCAD deficient cells, which could be rescued by both heptanoate and octanoate in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike GSH levels, the levels of total thiols increased after metabolic stress exposure, the size of this increase was not affected by differences in cell culture medium concentrations of glutamine, heptanoate or octanoate. Addition of a PPAR agonist further exacerbated stress-related GSH-depletion and viability loss, requiring higher concentrations of fatty acids to restore GSH levels and cell viability. Both odd- and even-numbered medium-chain fatty acids efficiently protect VLCADdeficient cells against metabolic stress-induced antioxidant depletion.

Abstract: Bile acids act as signalling molecules that contribute to maintenance of energy homeostasis in mice and humans. Activation of G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 induces energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, a role for the nuclear bile acid receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in BAT has remained ambiguous. We aimed to study the potential role of FXR in BAT development and functioning. Here we demonstrate low yet detectable expression of the α1/2 isoforms of FXR in murine BAT that markedly decreases upon cold exposure. Moderate adipose tissue-specific FXR overexpression in mice induces pronounced BAT whitening, presenting with large intracellular lipid droplets and extracellular collagen deposition. Expression of thermogenic marker genes including the target of Tgr5, Dio2, was significantly lower in BAT of chow-fed aP2-hFXR mice compared to wild-type controls. Transcriptomic analysis revealed marked up-regulation of extracellular matrix formation and down-regulation of mitochondrial functions in BAT from aP2-hFXR mice. In addition, markers of cell type lineages deriving from the dermomyotome, such as myocytes, as well as markers of cellular senescence were strongly induced. The response to cold and β3-adrenergic receptor agonism was blunted in these mice, yet resolved BAT whitening. Newborn cholestatic Cyp2c70−/− mice with a human-like bile acid profile also showed distinct BAT whitening and upregulation of myocyte-specific genes, while thermogenic markers were down-regulated. Ucp1 expression inversely correlated with plasma bile acid levels. Therefore, bile acid signalling via FXR has a role in BAT function already early in tissue development. Functionally, FXR activation appears to oppose TGR5-mediated thermogenesis.

Abstract: Long-term kleptoplasty, the capability to retain functional stolen chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) for several weeks to months, has been shown in a handful of Sacoglossa sea slugs. One of these sea slugs is Elysia timida, endemic to the Mediterranean, which retains functional chloroplasts of the macroalga Acetabularia acetabulum. To understand how light modulates the lipidome of E. timida, sea slug specimens were subjected to two different 4-week light treatments: regular light and quasi-dark conditions. Lipidomic analyses were performed by HILIC-HR-ESI-MS and MS/MS. Quasi-dark conditions caused a reduction in the amount of essential lipids for photosynthetic membranes, such as glycolipids, indicating high level of kleptoplast degradation under sub-optimal light conditions. However, maximum photosynthetic capacities (Fv/Fm) were identical in both light treatments (≈0.75), showing similar kleptoplast functionality and suggesting that older kleptoplasts were targeted for degradation. Although more stable, the phospholipidome showed differences between light treatments: the amount of certain lipid species of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) decreased under quasi-dark conditions, while other lipid species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE and lyso-PE (LPE) increased. Quasi-dark conditions promoted a decrease in the relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest a light-driven remodelling of the lipidome according to the functions of the different lipids and highlight the plasticity of polar lipids in the photosynthetic sea slug E. timida.

Abstract: The intestine is responsible for efficient absorption and packaging of dietary lipids before they enter the circulatory system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how intestinal enterocytes from diverse model organisms absorb dietary lipid and subsequently secrete the largest class of lipoproteins (chylomicrons) to meet the unique needs of each animal. We discuss the putative relationship between diet and metabolic disease progression, specifically Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Understanding the molecular response of intestinal cells to dietary lipid has the potential to undercover novel therapies to combat metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Fibrillary aggregated α-synuclein represents the neurologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease and is considered to play a causative role in the disease. Although the causes leading to α-synuclein aggregation are not clear, the GM1 ganglioside interaction is recognized to prevent this process. How GM1 exerts these functions is not completely clear, although a primary role of its soluble oligosaccharide (GM1-OS) is emerging. Indeed, we recently identified GM1-OS as the bioactive moiety responsible for GM1 neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties, specifically reverting the parkinsonian phenotype both in in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we report on GM1-OS efficacy against the α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity in vitro. By amyloid seeding aggregation assay and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated that GM1-OS was able to prevent both the spontaneous and the prion-like α-synuclein aggregation. Additionally, circular dichroism spectroscopy of recombinant monomeric α-synuclein showed that GM1-OS did not induce any change in α-synuclein secondary structure. Importantly, GM1-OS significantly increased neuronal survival and preserved neurite networks of dopaminergic neurons affected by α-synuclein oligomers, together with a reduction of microglia activation. These data further demonstrate that the ganglioside GM1 acts through its oligosaccharide also in preventing the α-synuclein pathogenic aggregation in Parkinson's disease, opening a perspective window for GM1-OS as drug candidate.

Abstract: Irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins is the underlying molecular cause of numerous pathologies, including diabetes type 2, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Such an abrupt protein aggregation results in the formation of small oligomers that can propagate into amyloid fibrils. A growing body of evidence suggests that protein aggregation can be uniquely altered by lipids. However, the role of the protein-to-lipid (P:L) ratio on the rate of protein aggregation, as well as the structure and toxicity of corresponding protein aggregates remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the P:L ratio of five different phospho- and sphingolipids on the rate of lysozyme aggregation. We observed significantly different rates of lysozyme aggregation at 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 P:L ratios of all analyzed lipids except phosphatidylcholine (PC). However, we found that at those P:L ratios, structurally and morphologically similar fibrils were formed. As a result, for all studies of lipids except PC, mature lysozyme aggregates exerted insignificantly different cell toxicity. These results demonstrate that the P:L ratio directly determines the rate of protein aggregation, however, has very little if any effect on the secondary structure of mature lysozyme aggregates. Furthermore, our results point to the lack of a direct relationship between the rate of protein aggregation, secondary structure, and toxicity of mature fibrils.

Abstract: Alcohol abuse and its related diseases are the major risk factors for human health. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although the mechanism of ALD has been widely investigated, liver metabolites associated with long-term alcohol intake-induced hepatic steatosis have not been well explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNA), a metabolite during nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, in the pathogenesis of ALD. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were subjected to chronic alcohol feeding with or without 1-MNA (50 mg/kg/day). Our data showed that 1-MNA administration significantly enhanced chronic alcohol consumption-induced hepatic steatosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that alcohol-increased hepatic protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP-1c), a key enzyme that regulates lipid lipogenesis, were enhanced in mice administered with 1-MNA, regardless of alcohol feeding. Consistently, alcohol-increased mRNA and protein levels of hepatic diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) were also exacerbated by 1-MNA administration. Alcohol-induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was enhanced by 1-MNA administration, which was evidenced by increased protein levels of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), phosphorylated- protein kinase r-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in the mouse liver. Overall, this study demonstrated that 1-MNA serves as a pathogenic factor in the development of ALD. Targeting liver 1-MNA levels may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for improving hepatic steatosis in ALD.

Abstract: Dihydrosphingolipids are lipids biosynthetically related to ceramides. An increase in ceramides is associated with enhanced fat storage in the liver, and inhibition of their synthesis is reported to prevent the appearance of steatosis in animal models. However, the precise association of dihydrosphingolipids with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is yet to be established. We employed a diet induced NAFLD mouse model to study the association between this class of compounds and disease progression. Mice fed a high-fat diet were sacrificed at 22, 30 and 40 weeks to reproduce the full spectrum of histological damage found in human disease, steatosis (NAFL) and steatohepatitis (NASH) with and without significant fibrosis. Blood and liver tissue samples were obtained from patients whose NAFLD severity was assessed histologically. To demonstrate the effect of dihydroceramides over NAFLD progression we treated mice with fenretinide an inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DEGS1). Lipidomic analyses were performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Triglycerides, cholesteryl esters and dihydrosphingolipids were increased in the liver of model mice in association with the degree of steatosis and fibrosis. Dihydroceramides increased with the histological severity observed in liver samples of mice (0.024 ± 0.003 nmol/mg vs 0.049 ± 0.005 nmol/mg, non-NAFLD vs NASH-fibrosis, p < 0.0001) and patients (0.105 ± 0.011 nmol/mg vs 0.165 ± 0.021 nmol/mg, p = 0.0221). Inhibition of DEGS1 induce a four-fold increase in dihydroceramides improving steatosis but increasing the inflammatory activity and fibrosis. In conclusion, the degree of histological damage in NAFLD correlate with dihydroceramide and dihydrosphingolipid accumulation.
Lay summary
Accumulation of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester lipids is the hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Using lipidomics, we examined the role of dihydrosphingolipids in NAFLD progression. Our results demonstrate that de novo dihydrosphingolipid synthesis is an early event in NAFLD and the concentrations of these lipids are correlated with histological severity in both mouse and human disease.

Distinct regions of Praja-1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase selectively bind to docosahexaenoic acid-containing phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol kinase δ,

Abstract: 1-Stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl (18:0/22:6)-phosphatidic acid (PA) interacts with and activates Praja-1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (full length: 615 aa) to ubiquitinate and degrade the serotonin transporter (SERT). SERT modulates serotonergic system activity and is a therapeutic target for depression, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) δ2 (full length: 1214 aa) interacts with Praja-1 in addition to SERT and generates 18:0/22:6-PA, which binds and activates Praja-1. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of Praja-1 with 18:0/22:6-PA and DGKδ2 in more detail. We first found that the N-terminal one-third region (aa 1–224) of Praja-1 bound to 18:0/22:6-PA and that Lys141 in the region was critical for binding to 18:0/22:6-PA. In contrast, the C-terminal catalytic domain of Praja-1 (aa 446–615) interacted with DGKδ2. Additionally, the N-terminal half of the catalytic domain (aa 309–466) of DGKδ2 intensely bound to Praja-1. Moreover, the N-terminal region containing the pleckstrin homology and C1 domains (aa 1–308) and the C-terminal half of the catalytic domain (aa 762–939) of DGKδ2 weakly associated with Praja-1. Taken together, these results reveal new functions of the N-terminal (aa 1–224) and C-terminal (aa 446–615) regions of Praja-1 and the N-terminal half of the catalytic region (aa 309–466) of DGKδ2 as regulatory domains. Moreover, it is likely that the DGKδ2–Praja-1–SERT heterotrimer proximally arranges the 18:0/22:6-PA-producing catalytic domain of DGKδ2, the 18:0/22:6-PA-binding regulatory domain of Praja-1, the ubiquitin-protein ligase catalytic domain of Praja-1 and the ubiquitination acceptor site-containing SERT C-terminal region.

Abstract: Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that maintain the glomerular filtration barrier. These cells are susceptible to lipotoxicity in the obese state and irreversibly lost during kidney disease leading to proteinuria and renal injury. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor whose activation can be renoprotective. This study examined the role of PPARγ in the lipotoxic podocyte using a PPARγ knockout (PPARγKO) cell line and since the activation of PPARγ by Thiazolidinediones (TZD) is limited by their side effects, it explored other alternative therapies to prevent podocyte lipotoxic damage. Wild-type and PPARγKO podocytes were exposed to the fatty acid palmitic acid (PA) and treated with the TZD (Pioglitazone) and/or the Retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist Bexarotene (BX). It revealed that podocyte PPARγ is essential for podocyte function. PPARγ deletion reduced key podocyte proteins including podocin and nephrin while increasing basal levels of oxidative and ER stress causing apoptosis and cell death. A combination therapy of low-dose TZD and BX activated both the PPARγ and RXR receptors reducing PA-induced podocyte damage. This study confirms the crucial role of PPARγ in podocyte biology and that their activation in combination therapy of TZD and BX may be beneficial in the treatment of obesity-related kidney disease.

Abstract: Background and aims
Scavenger receptor class B1 (SCARB1) - also known as the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor - is a multi-ligand scavenger receptor that is primarily expressed in liver and steroidogenic organs. This receptor is known for its function in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in mammals and hence disruption leads to a massive increase in HDL cholesterol in these species. The extracellular domain of SCARB1 - which is important for cholesterol handling - is highly conserved across multiple vertebrates, except in zebrafish. Methods: To examine the functional conservation of SCARB1 among vertebrates, two stable scarb1 knockout zebrafish lines, scarb1 715delA (scarb1 −1 nt) and scarb1 715_716insGG (scarb1 +2 nt), were created using CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
Results
We demonstrate that, in zebrafish, SCARB1 deficiency leads to disruption of carotenoid-based pigmentation, reduced fertility, and a decreased larvae survival rate, whereas steroidogenesis was unaltered. The observed reduced fertility is driven by defects in female fertility (−50 %, p < 0.001). Importantly, these alterations were independent of changes in free (wild-type 2.4 ± 0.2 μg/μl versus scarb1−/− 2.0 ± 0.1 μg/μl) as well as total (wild-type 4.2 ± 0.4 μg/μl versus scarb1−/− 4.0 ± 0.3 μg/μl) plasma cholesterol levels. Uptake of HDL in the liver of scarb1−/− zebrafish larvae was reduced (−86.7 %, p < 0.001), but this coincided with reduced perfusion of the liver. No effect was observed on lipoprotein uptake in the caudal vein. SCARB1 deficient canaries, which also lack carotenoids in their plumage, similarly as scarb1−/− zebrafish, failed to show an increase in plasma free- and total cholesterol levels.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the specific function of SCARB1 in maintaining plasma cholesterol could be an evolutionary novelty that became prominent in mammals, while other known functions were already present earlier during vertebrate evolution.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or pathological hepatic lipid overload, is considered to affect obese individuals. However, NAFLD in lean individuals is prevalent, especially in South Asian population. The pathophysiology of lean NAFLD is not well understood and most animal models of NAFLD use the high-fat diet paradigm. To bridge this gap, we have developed a diet-independent model of NAFLD in zebrafish. We have previously shown that chronic systemic inflammation causes metabolic changes in the liver leading to hepatic fat accumulation in an IL6 overexpressing (IL6-OE) zebrafish model. In the present study, we compared the hepatic lipid composition of adult IL6-OE zebrafish to the controls and found an accumulation of saturated triacylglycerols and a reduction in the unsaturated triacylglycerol species reminiscent of NAFLD patients. Zebrafish is an ideal system for chemical genetic screens. We tested whether the hepatic lipid accumulation in the IL6-OE is responsive to chemical treatment. We found that PPAR-gamma agonist Rosiglitazone, known to reduce lipid overload in the high-fat diet models of NAFLD, could ameliorate the fatty liver phenotype of the IL6-OE fish. Rosiglitazone treatment reduced the accumulation of saturated lipids and showed a concomitant increase in unsaturated TAG species in our inflammation-induced NAFLD model. Our observations suggest that the IL6-OE model can be effective for small molecule screening to identify compounds that can reverse hepatic lipid accumulation, especially relevant to lean NAFLD.

Cholesterol homeostasis in hair follicle keratinocytes is disrupted by impaired ABCA5 activity,

Abstract: The importance of cholesterol in hair follicle biology is underscored by its links to the pathogenesis of alopecias and hair growth disorders. Reports have associated defects in ABCA5, a membrane transporter, with altered keratinocyte cholesterol distribution in individuals with a form of congenital hypertrichosis, yet the biological basis for this defect in hair growth remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the impact of altered ABCA5 activity on hair follicle keratinocyte behaviour. Primary keratinocytes isolated from the outer root sheath of plucked human hair follicles were utilised as a relevant cell model. Following exogenous cholesterol loading, an increase in ABCA5 co-localisation to intracellular organelles was seen. Knockdown of ABCA5 revealed a dysregulation in cholesterol homeostasis, with LXR agonism leading to partial restoration of the homeostatic response. Filipin staining and live BODIPY cholesterol immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a reduction in endo-lysosomal cholesterol following ABCA5 knockdown. Analysis of oxysterols showed a significant increase in the fold change of 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-β-hydroxycholesterol following cholesterol loading in ORS keratinocytes, after ABCA5 knockdown. These data suggest a role for ABCA5 in the intracellular compartmentalisation of free cholesterol in primary hair follicle keratinocytes. The loss of normal homeostatic response, following the delivery of excess cholesterol after ABCA5 knockdown, suggests an impact on LXR-mediated transcriptional activity. The loss of ABCA5 in the hair follicle could lead to impaired endo-lysosomal cholesterol transport, impacting pathways known to influence hair growth. This avenue warrants further investigation.

Abstract: Proximal intestinal enterocytes expresses both intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (IFABP; FABP2) and liver-FABP (LFABP; FABP1). These FABPs are thought to be important in the net uptake of dietary lipid from the intestinal lumen, however their specific and potentially unique functions in the enterocyte remain incompletely understood. We previously showed markedly divergent phenotypes in LFABP−/− vs. IFABP−/− mice fed high-fat diets, with the former becoming obese and the latter remaining lean relative to wild-type (WT) mice, supporting different functional roles for each protein. Interestingly, neither mouse model displayed increased fecal lipid concentration, raising the question of whether the presence of one FABP was sufficient to compensate for absence of the other. Here, we generated an LFABP and IFABP double knockout mouse (DKO) to determine whether simultaneous ablation would lead to fat malabsorption, and to further interrogate the individual vs. overlapping functions of these proteins. Male WT, IFABP−/−, LFABP−/−, and DKO mice were fed a low-fat (10 % kcal) or high-fat (45 % kcal) diet for 12 weeks. The body weights and fat mass of the DKO mice integrated those of the LFABP−/− and IFABP−/− single knockouts, supporting the notion that IFABP and LFABP have distinct functions in intestinal lipid assimilation that result in downstream alterations in systemic energy metabolism. Remarkably, no differences in fecal fat concentrations were found in the DKO compared to WT, revealing that the FABPs are not required for net intestinal uptake of dietary lipid.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory condition that leads to a variety of life-threatening cardiovascular diseases, is a worldwide public health concern. Endothelial cells (ECs), which line the inside of blood vessels, play an important role in atherogenic initiation. Endothelial activation and inflammation are indispensable for the early stage of atherosclerosis. Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the stability and activity of target proteins, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for many inflammatory diseases. However, the role of USP14 on ECs is undefined. In this study, we found that USP14 is downregulated in either atherosclerosis patient specimens or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-stimulated ECs as compared to the control group. Overexpression of USP14 in ECs restrains ox-LDL-stimulated nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and subsequent adhesion molecule production. USP14 inhibits endothelium proinflammatory activation by suppressing the degradation of the negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, nod-like receptor family caspase recruitment domain family domain containing 5 (NLRC5). Finally, our in vivo experiments confirmed that USP14 adenovirus injection in apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE−/−) mice fed with a western diet reduced the atherosclerotic lesion size, inhibited macrophage accumulation in the intima, and restricted the progression of atherosclerosis. Our results reveal that USP14 may represent a new therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The question of how lung cancer progresses in never-smokers remains largely unanswered. In our analysis of data from 1727 lung cancer patients, we observed a difference of only 47 days in the overall survival between lung adenocarcinoma patients who were smokers vis-a-vis never-smokers - the disease has a poor prognosis irrespective of the smoking status, or gender. We have investigated the possible collaboration between the nAChR and hypoxia signaling pathway to explicate a mechanism of disease progression in never-smokers using patient-derived tumor cells. We found a previously unidentified increase in both acetylcholine and nAChR-α7 levels in non-small cell lung cancer cells in hypoxia. A similar increase in ubiquitously expressed nAChR-α7 transcripts was also observed in other cancer lines and primary tumor tissues. A direct binding of HIF-1α with the hypoxia-response element (HRE) present at −48 position preceding the transcriptional start site in nAChR-α7 promoter region was established. Crucially, the increased acetylcholine levels in hypoxia drove a feedback loop via modulation of PI3K/AKT pathway to stabilize HIF-1α in hypoxia. Further, hypoxia-mediated metastasis and induction of HIF-1α in these cells was significantly reversed by bungarotoxin, an antagonist of nAChR-α7. The nAChR-AKT-HIF network needs to be further investigated to conclusively prove its mechanism and to explore its therapeutic potential. Our study gives a plausible explanation for the equally worse prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers wherein the nAChR signaling is enhanced in hypoxia by acetylcholine in the absence of nicotine.

Abstract: High-sugar diet (HSD), high-cholesterol diet (HCD), and high-fat diet (HFD) all modulate the levels of lipids. However, there is a lack of comparative data on the effects of different diets on phospholipids (PLs). Given their important role in physiology and disease, there has been an increasing focus on altered PLs in liver and brain disorders. This study aims to determine the effects of HSD, HCD, and HFD for 14-week feeding on the PL profile of the mouse liver and hippocampus. Quantitative analysis of 116 and 113 PL molecular species in liver and hippocampus tissues revealed that the HSD, HCD, and HFD significantly affected the PLs in liver and hippocampus, especially decreased the levels of plasmenylethanolamine (pPE) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Overall, the impact of HFD on liver PLs was more significant, consistent with the morphological changes in the liver. Compared to HSD and HCD, HFD induced a significant decrease in PC (P-16:0/18:1) and an increase in LPE (18:0) and LPE (18:1) in liver. In the liver of mice fed with different diets, the expression of the key enzymes Gnpat, Agps in the pPE biosynthesis pathway and peroxisome-associated membrane proteins pex14p were decreased. In addition, all diets significantly reduced the expression of Gnpat, pex7p, and pex16p in hippocampus tissue. In conclusion, HSD, HCD, and HFD enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver, led to liver injury, significantly affected the liver and hippocampus PLs, and decreased the expression of genes related to plasmalogen synthesis in mouse liver and hippocampus, which caused severe plasmalogen reduction.

STAU1 promotes adipogenesis by regulating the alternative splicing of Pparγ2 mRNA,

Abstract: During adipocyte differentiation, specific genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) are transcribed and post-transcriptional pre-mRNA is processed into mature mRNA. Since Pparγ2 pre-mRNAs contain putative binding sites for STAUFEN1 (STAU1), which can affect the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, we hypothesized that STAU1 might regulate the alternative splicing of Pparγ2 pre-mRNA. In this study, we found that STAU1 affects the differentiation of 3 T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Through RNA-seq analysis, we confirmed that STAU1 can regulate alternative splicing events during adipocyte differentiation, mainly through exon skipping, which suggests that STAU1 is mainly involved in exon splicing. In addition, gene annotation and cluster analysis revealed that the genes affected by alternative splicing were enriched in lipid metabolism pathways. We further demonstrated that STAU1 can regulate the alternative splicing of Pparγ2 pre-mRNA and affect the splicing of exon E1 through RNA immuno-precipitation, photoactivatable ribonucleotide enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation assays. Finally, we confirmed that STAU1 can regulate the alternative splicing of Pparγ2 pre-mRNA in stromal vascular fraction cells. In summary, this study improves our understanding of the function of STAU1 in adipocyte differentiation and the regulatory network of adipocyte differentiation-related gene expression.

Abstract: Alkylglycerol monooxygenase (AGMO) and plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (PEDS1) are enzymes involved in ether lipid metabolism. While AGMO degrades plasmanyl lipids by oxidative cleavage of the ether bond, PEDS1 exclusively synthesizes a specific subclass of ether lipids, the plasmalogens, by introducing a vinyl ether double bond into plasmanylethanolamine phospholipids. Ether lipids are characterized by an ether linkage at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone and they are found in membranes of different cell types. Decreased plasmalogen levels have been associated with neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Agmo-deficient mice do not present an obvious phenotype under unchallenged conditions. In contrast, Peds1 knockout mice display a growth phenotype. To investigate the molecular consequences of Agmo and Peds1 deficiency on the mouse lipidome, five tissues from each mouse model were isolated and subjected to high resolution mass spectrometry allowing the characterization of up to 2013 lipid species from 42 lipid subclasses. Agmo knockout mice moderately accumulated plasmanyl and plasmenyl lipid species. Peds1-deficient mice manifested striking changes characterized by a strong reduction of plasmenyl lipids and a concomitant massive accumulation of plasmanyl lipids resulting in increased total ether lipid levels in the analyzed tissues except for the class of phosphatidylethanolamines where total levels remained remarkably constant also in Peds1 knockout mice. The rate-limiting enzyme in ether lipid metabolism, FAR1, was not upregulated in Peds1-deficient mice, indicating that the selective loss of plasmalogens is not sufficient to activate the feedback mechanism observed in total ether lipid deficiency.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lysophospholipid that is a notable biomarker of kidney injury. However, it is not clear how LPA is produced in renal cells. In this study, we explored LPA generation and its enzymatic pathway in a rat kidney-derived cell, NRK52E cells. Culturing of NRK52E cells with acyl lysophosphatidylcholine (acyl LPC), or lyso-platelet activating factor (lysoPAF, alkyl LPC) was resulted in increased extracellular level of choline, co-product with LPA by lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD). Their activities were enhanced by addition of calcium ions to the cell culture medium, but failed to be inhibited by S32826, an autotaxin (ATX)-specific inhibitor. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis revealed the small, but significant extracellular production of acyl LPA/cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) and alkyl LPA/cPA. The mRNA expression of glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) 7 with lysoPLD activity was elevated in confluent NRK52E cells cultured over 3 days. GDE7 plasmid-transfection of NRK52E cells augmented both extracellular and intracellular productions of LPAs (acyl and alkyl) as well as extracellular productions of cPAs (acyl and alkyl) from exogenous LPCs (acyl and alkyl). These results suggest that intact NRK52E cells are able to produce choline and LPA/cPA from exogenous LPCs through the enzymatic action of GDE7 that is located on the plasma membranes and intracellular membranes.

Abstract: In the maternal circulation, apoB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and apoA1-containing high-density lipoproteins (HDL) transport lipids. The production of lipoproteins in the placenta has been suggested, but the directionality of release has not been resolved. We compared apolipoprotein concentrations and size-exclusion chromatography elution profiles of lipoproteins in maternal/fetal circulations, and in umbilical arteries/veins; identified placental lipoprotein-producing cells; and studied temporal induction of lipoprotein-synthesizing machinery during pregnancy. We observed that maternal and fetal lipoproteins are different with respect to concentrations and elution profiles. Surprisingly, concentrations and elution profiles of lipoproteins in umbilical arteries and veins were similar indicating their homeostatic control. Human placental cultures synthesized apoB100-containing LDL-sized and apoA1-containing HDL-sized particles. Immunolocalization techniques revealed that ApoA1 was present mainly in syncytiotrophoblasts. MTP, a critical protein for lipoprotein assembly, was in these trophoblasts. ApoB was in the placental stroma indicating that trophoblasts secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins into the stroma. ApoB and MTP expressions increased in placentas from the 2nd trimester to term, whereas apoA1 expression was unchanged. Thus, our studies provide new information regarding the timing of lipoprotein gene induction during gestation, the cells involved in lipoprotein assembly and the gel filtration profiles of human placental lipoproteins. Next, we observed that mouse placenta produces MTP, apoB100, apoB48 and apoA1. The expression of genes gradually increased and peaked in late gestation. This information may be useful in identifying transcription factors regulating the induction of these genes in gestation and the importance of placental lipoprotein assembly in fetal development.

Abstract: Ceramides (Cer) have been shown as lipotoxic inducers, which disturb numerous cell-signaling pathways, leading to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of de novo hepatic ceramide synthesis in energy and liver homeostasis in mice. We generated mice lacking serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Sptlc2), the rate limiting enzyme of ceramide de novo synthesis, in liver under albumin promoter. Liver function, glucose homeostasis, bile acid (BA) metabolism and hepatic sphingolipids content were assessed using metabolic tests and LC-MS. Despite lower expression of hepatic Sptlc2, we observed an increased concentration of hepatic Cer, associated with a 10-fold increase in neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) expression, and a decreased sphingomyelin content in the liver. Sptlc2ΔLiv mice were protected against obesity induced by high fat diet and displayed a defect in lipid absorption. In addition, an important increase in tauro-muricholic acid was associated with a downregulation of the nuclear BA receptor FXR target genes. Sptlc2 deficiency also enhanced glucose tolerance and attenuated hepatic glucose production, while the latter effect was dampened in presence of nSMase2 inhibitor. Finally, Sptlc2 disruption promoted apoptosis, inflammation and progressive development of hepatic fibrosis, worsening with age. Our data suggest a compensatory mechanism to regulate hepatic ceramides content from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, with deleterious impact on liver homeostasis. In addition, our results show the involvement of hepatic sphingolipid modulation in BA metabolism and hepatic glucose production in an insulin-independent manner, which highlight the still under-researched role of ceramides in many metabolic functions.

Abstract: Membrane protein and phospholipid (PL) composition changes in response to environmental cues and during infections. To achieve these, bacteria use adaptation mechanisms involving covalent modification and remodelling of the acyl chain length of PLs. However, little is known about bacterial pathways regulated by PLs. Here, we investigated proteomic changes in the biofilm of P. aeruginosa phospholipase mutant (∆plaF) with altered membrane PL composition. The results revealed profound alterations in the abundance of many biofilm-related two-component systems (TCSs), including accumulation of PprAB, a key regulator of the transition to biofilm. Furthermore, a unique phosphorylation pattern of transcriptional regulators, transporters and metabolic enzymes, as well as differential production of several proteases, in ∆plaF, indicate that PlaF-mediated virulence adaptation involves complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional response. Moreover, proteomics and biochemical assays revealed the depletion of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake pathway proteins in ∆plaF, while proteins from alternative iron-uptake systems were accumulated. These suggest that PlaF may function as a switch between different iron-acquisition pathways. The observation that PL-acyl chain modifying and PL synthesis enzymes were overproduced in ∆plaF reveals the interconnection of degradation, synthesis and modification of PLs for proper membrane homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism by which PlaF simultaneously affects multiple pathways remains to be elucidated, we suggest that alteration of PL composition in ∆plaF plays a role for the global adaptive response in P. aeruginosa mediated by TCSs and proteases. Our study revealed the global regulation of virulence and biofilm by PlaF and suggests that targeting this enzyme may have therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Vitellogenins (Vtgs) are essential for female reproduction in oviparous animals, yet the exact roles and mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we knocked out vtg1, which is the most abundant Vtg in zebrafish, Danio rerio via the CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. We aimed to identify the roles of Vtg1 and related mechanisms in reproduction and development. We found that, the Vtg1-deficient female zebrafish reduced gonadosomatic index, egg production, yolk granules and mature follicles in ovary compared to the wide type (WT). Moreover, the Vtg1-deficient zebrafish diminished hatching rates, cumulative survival rate, swimming capacity and food intake, but increased malformation rate, and delayed swim bladder development during embryo and early-larval phases. The Vtg1-deficiency in female broodstock inhibited docosahexaenoic acid-enriched phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) transportation from liver to ovary, which lowered DHA-PC content in ovary and offspring during larval stage. However, the Vtg1-deficient zebrafish increased gradually the total DHA-PC content via exogeneous food intake, and the differences in swimming capacity and food intake returned to normal as they matured. Furthermore, supplementing Vtg1-deficient zebrafish with dietary PC and DHA partly ameliorated the impaired female reproductive capacity and larval development during early phases. This study indicates that, DHA and PC carried by Vtg1 are crucial for female fecundity, and affect embryo and larval development through maternal-nutrition effects. This is the first study elucidating the nutrient and physiological functions of Vtg1 and the underlying biochemical mechanisms in fish reproduction and development.

Abstract: Individuals with loss-of-function mutations in the ANGPTL3 gene express a rare lipid phenotype called Familial Combined Hypolipidemia (FHBL2). FHBL2 individuals show reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides as well as of lipoprotein particles, including HDL. This feature is particularly remarkable in homozygotes in whom ANGPTL3 in blood is completely absent. ANGPTL3 acts as a circulating inhibitor of LPL and EL and it is thought that EL hyperactivity is the cause of plasma HDL reduction in FHBL2. Nevertheless, the consequences of ANGTPL3 deficiency on HDL functionality have been poorly explored. In this report, HDL isolated from homozygous and heterozygous FHBL2 individuals were evaluated for their ability to preserve endothelial homeostasis as compared to control HDL. It was found that only the complete absence of ANGPTL3 alters HDL subclass distribution, as homozygous, but not heterozygous, carriers have reduced content of large and increased content of small HDL with no alterations in HDL2 and HDL3 size. The plasma content of preβ-HDL was reduced in carriers and showed a positive correlation with plasma ANGPTL3 levels. Changes in composition did not however alter the functionality of FHBL2 HDL, as particles isolated from carriers retained their capacity to promote NO production and to inhibit VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. Furthermore, no significant changes in circulating levels of soluble ICAM-1 and E-selectin were detected in carriers. These results indicate that changes in HDL composition associated with the partial or complete absence of ANGPTL3 did not alter some of the potentially anti-atherogenic functions of these lipoproteins.

Abstract: ω-Alkynyl-fatty acids can be used as probes for covalent binding to intracellular macromolecules. To inform future in vivo studies, we determined the rates of reaction of ω-alkynyl-labeled linoleate with recombinant enzymes of the skin 12R-lipoxygenase (12R-LOX) pathway involved in epidermal barrier formation (12R-LOX, epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX3), and SDR9C7). We also examined the reactivity of ω-alkynyl-arachidonic acid with representative lipoxygenase enzymes employing either “carboxyl end-first” substrate binding (5S-LOX) or “tail-first” (platelet-type 12S-LOX). ω-Alkynyl-linoleic acid was oxygenated by 12R-LOX at 62 ± 9 % of the rate compared to linoleic acid, the alkynyl-9R-HPODE product was isomerized by eLOX3 at only 43 ± 1 % of the natural substrate, whereas its epoxy alcohol product was converted to epoxy ketone linoleic by an NADH-dependent dehydrogenase (SDR9C7) with 91 ± 1 % efficiency. The results suggest the optimal approach will be application of the 12R-LOX/eLOX3-derived epoxyalcohol, which should be most efficiently incorporated into the pathway and allow subsequent analysis of covalent binding to epidermal proteins. Regarding the orientation of substrate binding in LOX catalysis, our results and previous reports suggest the ω-alkynyl group has a stronger inhibitory effect on tail-first binding, as might be expected. Beyond slowing the reaction, however, we found that the tail-first binding and transformation of ω-alkynyl-arachidonic acid by platelet-type 12S-LOX results in almost complete enzyme inactivation, possibly due to reactive intermediates blocking the enzyme active site. Overall, the results reinforce the conclusion that ω-alkynyl-fatty acids are suitable for selected applications after appropriate reactivity is established.

Abstract: A hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) formed by macrophages accumulating around lipid droplets and dead cells in the liver is a unique feature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that triggers progression of liver fibrosis. As hCLS plays a key role in the progression of NASH fibrosis, hCLS formation has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have potential suppressive effects on NASH fibrosis; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. Here, we report that n-3 PUFA-enriched Fat-1 transgenic mice are resistant to hCLS formation and liver fibrosis in a NASH model induced by a combination of high-fat diet, CCl4 and a Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry-based mediator lipidomics revealed that the amount of endogenous n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites, such as 17,18-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-diHETE), and 19,20-epoxy docosapentaenoic acid (19,20-EpDPE), was significantly elevated in Fat-1 mice, along with hCLS formation. In particular, DHA-derived 19,20-EpDPE produced by Cyp4f18 attenuated the hCLS formation and liver fibrosis in a G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120)-dependent manner. These results indicated that 19,20-EpDPE is an endogenous active metabolite that mediates the preventive effect of n-3 PUFAs against NASH fibrosis.

Abstract: Amyloid formation is a hallmark of many medical diseases including diabetes type 2, Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases. Under these pathological conditions, misfolded proteins self-assemble forming oligomers and fibrils, structurally heterogeneous aggregates that exhibit a large variety of shapes and forms. A growing body of evidence points to drastic changes in the lipid profile in organs affected by amyloidogenic diseases. In this study, we investigated the extent to which individual phospho- and sphingolipids, as well as their mixtures can impact insulin aggregation. Our results show that lipids and their mixtures uniquely alter rates of insulin aggregation simultaneously changing the secondary structure of protein aggregates that are grown in their presence. These structurally different protein-lipid aggregates impact cell viability to different extent while using distinct mechanisms of toxicity. These findings suggest that irreversible changes in lipid profiles of organs may trigger formation of toxic protein species that in turn are responsible for the onset and progression of amyloidogenic diseases.

Abstract: One of the major functions of peroxisomes in mammals is oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Genetic defects in peroxisomal β-oxidation result in the accumulation of VLCFAs and lead to a variety of health problems, such as demyelination of nervous tissues. However, the mechanisms by which VLCFAs cause tissue degeneration have not been fully elucidated. Recently, we found that the addition of small amounts of isopropanol can enhance the solubility of saturated VLCFAs in an aqueous medium. In this study, we characterized the biological effect of extracellular VLCFAs in peroxisome-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, neural crest-derived pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), and immortalized adult Fischer rat Schwann cells (IFRS1) using this solubilizing technique. C20:0 FA was the most toxic of the C16–C26 FAs tested in all cells. The basis of the toxicity of C20:0 FA was apoptosis and was observed at 5 μM and 30 μM in peroxisome-deficient and wild-type CHO cells, respectively. The sensitivity of wild-type CHO cells to cytotoxic C20:0 FA was enhanced in the presence of a peroxisomal β-oxidation inhibitor. Further, a positive correlation was evident between cell toxicity and the extent of intracellular accumulation of toxic FA. These results suggest that peroxisomes are pivotal in the detoxification of apoptotic VLCFAs by preventing their accumulation.

Abstract: Diet-induced obesity mouse models are widely utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms of dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as for screening potential drug compounds. However, there is limited knowledge regarding specific signature lipids that accurately reflect dietary disorders. In this study, we aimed to identify key lipid signatures using LC/MS-based untargeted lipidomics in the plasma, liver, adipose tissue (AT), and skeletal muscle tissues (SKM) of male C57BL/6J mice that were fed chow, LFD, or obesogenic diets (HFD, HFHF, and HFCD) for a duration of 20 weeks. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive lipid analysis to assess similarities and differences with human lipid profiles. The mice fed obesogenic diets exhibited weight gain, glucose intolerance, elevated BMI, glucose and insulin levels, and a fatty liver, resembling characteristics of T2DM and obesity in humans. In total, we identified approximately 368 lipids in plasma, 433 in the liver, 493 in AT, and 624 in SKM. Glycerolipids displayed distinct patterns across the tissues, differing from human findings. However, changes in sphingolipids, phospholipids, and the expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes showed similarities to reported human findings. Significantly modulated pathways in the obesogenic diet-fed groups included ceramide de novo synthesis, sphingolipid remodeling, and the carboxylesterase pathway, while lipoprotein-mediated pathways were minimally affected. This study provides a tissue-specific comparison of lipid composition, highlighting the usefulness of DIO models in preclinical research. However, caution is warranted when extrapolating findings from these models to dyslipidemia-associated pathologies and their complications in humans.

Abstract: Pancreatic β-cell apoptosis is a key feature of diabetes and can be induced by chronic exposure to saturated fatty acids (FAs). However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We presently evaluated the role of Mcl-1 and mTOR in mice fed with high-fat-diet (HFD) and β-cells exposed to the overloaded palmitic acid (PA). Compared with normal-chow-diet (NCD)-fed mice, HFD group showed impaired glucose tolerance after two months. Along with the diabetes progression, pancreatic islets first became hypertrophic and then atrophic, the ratio of β-cell:α-cell increased in the islets of four months HFD-fed mice while decreased after six months. This process was accompanied by significantly increased β-cell apoptosis and AMPK activity, and decreased Mcl-1 expression and mTOR activity. Consistently, glucose-induced insulin secretion dropped. In terms of mechanism, PA with lipotoxic dose could activate AMPK, which in turn inhibited ERK-stimulated Mcl-1Thr163 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, AMPK blocked Akt activity to release Akt inhibition on GSK3β, followed by GSK3β-initiated Mcl-1Ser159 phosphorylation. The context of Mcl-1 phosphorylation finally led to its degradation by ubiquitination. Also, AMPK inhibited the activity of mTORC1, resulting in a lower level of Mcl-1. Suppression of mTORC1 activity and Mcl-1 expression positively related to β-cell failure. Alteration of Mcl-1 or mTOR expression rendered different tolerance of β-cell to different dose of PA. In conclusion, lipid oversupply-induced dual modulation of mTORC1 and Mcl-1 finally led to β-cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion.

Abstract: 17,18-Epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EEQ), the most abundant eicosanoid generated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in C. elegans, is a potential signaling molecule in the regulation of pharyngeal pumping activity of this nematode. As a chiral molecule, 17,18-EEQ can exist in two stereoisomers, the 17(R),18(S)- and 17(S),18(R)-EEQ enantiomers. Here we tested the hypothesis that 17,18-EEQ may function as a second messenger of the feeding-promoting neurotransmitter serotonin and stimulates pharyngeal pumping and food uptake in a stereospecific manner. Serotonin treatment of wildtype worms induced a more than twofold increase of free 17,18-EEQ levels. As revealed by chiral lipidomics analysis, this increase was almost exclusively due to an enhanced release of the (R,S)-enantiomer of 17,18-EEQ. In contrast to the wildtype strain, serotonin failed to induce 17,18-EEQ formation as well as to accelerate pharyngeal pumping in mutant strains defective in the serotonin SER-7 receptor. However, the pharyngeal activity of the ser-7 mutant remained fully responsive to exogenous 17,18-EEQ administration. Short term incubations of well-fed and starved wildtype nematodes showed that both racemic 17,18-EEQ and 17(R),18(S)-EEQ were able to increase pharyngeal pumping frequency and the uptake of fluorescence-labeled microspheres, while 17(S),18(R)-EEQ and also 17,18-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-DHEQ, the hydrolysis product of 17,18-EEQ) were ineffective. Taken together, these results show that serotonin induces 17,18-EEQ formation in C. elegans via the SER-7 receptor and that both the formation of this epoxyeicosanoid and its subsequent stimulatory effect on pharyngeal activity proceed with high stereospecificity confined to the (R,S)-enantiomer.

Abstract: Retinoic acid possesses potent immunomodulatory properties in various cell types, including macrophages. In this study, we first investigated the effects at the transcriptional and functional levels of exogenous retinoic acid in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in the presence or absence of interleukin 4 (IL4), a cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We examined the effect of IL4 on vitamin A homeostasis in macrophages by quantifying retinoid synthesis and secretion. Our RNAseq data show that exogenous retinoic acid synergizes with IL4 to regulate anti-inflammatory pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and phagocytosis. Efferocytosis and lysosomal degradation assays validated gene expression changes at the functional level. IL4 treatment altered the expression of several genes involved in vitamin A transport and conversion to retinoic acid. Radiolabeling experiments and mass spectrometry assays revealed that IL4 stimulates retinoic acid production and secretion in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)-dependent manner. In summary, our studies highlight the key role of exogenous and endogenous retinoic acid in shaping the anti-inflammatory response of macrophages.

Abstract: Total absence of adipose tissue (lipoatrophy) is associated with the development of severe metabolic disorders including hepatomegaly and fatty liver. Here, we sought to investigate the impact of severe lipoatrophy induced by deletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) exclusively in adipocytes on lipid metabolism in mice. Untargeted lipidomics of plasma, gastrocnemius and liver uncovered a systemic depletion of the essential linoleic (LA) and α-linolenic (ALA) fatty acids from several lipid classes (storage lipids, glycerophospholipids, free fatty acids) in lipoatrophic mice. Our data revealed that such essential fatty acid depletion was linked to increased: 1) capacity for liver mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), 2) citrate synthase activity and coenzyme Q content in the liver, 3) whole-body oxygen consumption and reduced respiratory exchange rate in the dark period, and 4) de novo lipogenesis and carbon flux in the TCA cycle. The key role of de novo lipogenesis in hepatic steatosis was evidenced by an accumulation of stearic, oleic, sapienic and mead acids in liver. Our results thus indicate that the simultaneous activation of the antagonic processes FAO and de novo lipogenesis in liver may create a futile metabolic cycle leading to a preferential depletion of LA and ALA. Noteworthy, this previously unrecognized cycle may also explain the increased energy expenditure displayed by lipoatrophic mice, adding a new piece to the metabolic regulation puzzle in lipoatrophies.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LD) are important regulators of lipid metabolism and are implicated in several diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the roles of LD in cell pathophysiology remain elusive. Hence, new approaches that enable better characterization of LD are essential. This study establishes that Laurdan, a widely used fluorescent probe, can be used to label, quantify, and characterize changes in cell LD properties. Using lipid mixtures containing artificial LD we show that Laurdan GP depends on LD composition. Accordingly, enrichment in cholesterol esters (CE) shifts Laurdan GP from ∼0.60 to ∼0.70. Moreover, live-cell confocal microscopy shows that cells present multiple LD populations with distinctive biophysical features. The hydrophobicity and fraction of each LD population are cell type dependent and change differently in response to nutrient imbalance, cell density, and upon inhibition of LD biogenesis. The results show that cellular stress caused by increased cell density and nutrient overload increased the number of LD and their hydrophobicity and contributed to the formation of LD with very high GP values, likely enriched in CE. In contrast, nutrient deprivation was accompanied by decreased LD hydrophobicity and alterations in cell plasma membrane properties. In addition, we show that cancer cells present highly hydrophobic LD, compatible with a CE enrichment of these organelles. The distinct biophysical properties of LD contribute to the diversity of these organelles, suggesting that the specific alterations in their properties might be one of the mechanisms triggering LD pathophysiological actions and/or be related to the different mechanisms underlying LD metabolism.

Abstract: Ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) is a sphingolipid formed by the phosphorylation of ceramide; it regulates various physiological functions, including cell survival, proliferation, and inflammatory responses. In mammals, ceramide kinase (CerK) is the only C1P-producing enzyme currently known. However, it has been suggested that C1P is also produced by a CerK-independent pathway, although the identity of this CerK-independent C1P was unknown. Here, we identified human diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) ζ as a novel C1P-producing enzyme and demonstrated that DGKζ catalyzes the phosphorylation of ceramide to produce C1P. Analysis using fluorescently labeled ceramide (NBD-ceramide) demonstrated that only DGKζ among ten kinds of DGK isoforms increased C1P production by transient overexpression of the DGK isoforms. Furthermore, an enzyme activity assay using purified DGKζ revealed that DGKζ could directly phosphorylate ceramide to produce C1P. Furthermore, genetic deletion of DGKζ decreased the formation of NBD-C1P and the levels of endogenous C18:1/24:1- and C18:1/26:0-C1P. Interestingly, the levels of endogenous C18:1/26:0-C1P were not decreased by the knockout of CerK in the cells. These results suggest that DGKζ is also involved in the formation of C1P under physiological conditions.

Abstract: The anti-obesity thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), and irisin, an exercise- and/or cold-induced myokine, stimulate thermogenesis and energy consumption while decreasing lipid accumulation. The involvement of ATP signaling in adipocyte cell function and obesity has attracted increasing attention, but the crosstalk between the purinergic signaling cascade and anti-obesity hormones lacks experimental evidence. In this study, we investigated the effects of T3 and irisin in the transcriptomics of membrane-bound purinoceptors, ectonucleotidase enzymes and nucleoside transporters participating in the purinergic signaling in cultured human adipocytes. The RNA-seq analysis revealed that differentiated adipocytes express high amounts of ADORA1, P2RY11, P2RY12, and P2RX6 gene transcripts, along with abundant levels of transcriptional products encoding to purine metabolizing enzymes (ENPP2, ENPP1, NT5E, ADA and ADK) and transporters (SLC29A1, SCL29A2). The transcriptomics of purinergic signaling markers changed in parallel to the upsurge of “browning” adipocyte markers, like UCP1 and P2RX5, after treatment with T3 and irisin. Upregulation of ADORA1, ADORA2A and P2RX4 gene transcription was obtained with irisin, whereas T3 preferentially upregulated NT5E, SLC29A2 and P2RY11 genes. Irisin was more powerful than T3 towards inhibition of the leptin gene transcription, the SCL29A1 gene encoding for the ENT1 transporter, the E-NPP2 (autotaxin) gene, and genes that encode for two ADP-sensitive P2Y receptors, P2RY1 and P2RY12. These findings indicate that anti-obesity irisin and T3 hormones differentially affect the purinergic signaling transcriptomics, which might point towards new directions for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders that are worth to be pursued in future functional studies.

Postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins promote the adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells via the LRP1/caveolin-1/AKT1 pathway,

Abstract: Diet-induced obesity (OB) is usually accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein (TRL) particles in the circulation. We previously found that postprandial TRL combined with insulin induced the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which may represent a key mechanism underlying obesity. However, the specific mechanism and signaling pathway involved in this process remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that, in the postprandial state, patients with obesity had significantly higher levels of TG and remnant cholesterol (RC) than normal-weight controls. In vitro, we found that postprandial TRL, together with insulin, promoted the adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs), as evidenced by the increased expression of lipogenesis-related genes and their protein products, including low-density lipoprotein related protein 1 (LRP1). Besides, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression was also significantly upregulated under this condition. Cav-1 and LRP1 were observed to interact, and then led to the activation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the inhibition of LRP1 or Cav-1 significantly attenuated the adipogenic differentiation of AMSCs and downregulated AKT1 phosphorylation levels. Moreover, treatment with a selective AKT1 inhibitor significantly suppressed postprandial TRL and insulin-induced adipogenesis in AMSCs. Combined, our results demonstrated that, in association with insulin, postprandial TRL can promote the adipogenic differentiation of AMSCs in a manner that is dependent on the LRP1/Cav-1-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT1 signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that a postprandial increase in TRL content is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia and diet-induced obesity.
