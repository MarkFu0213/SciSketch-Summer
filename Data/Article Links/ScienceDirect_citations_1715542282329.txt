Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is a human fungal pathogen that often causes infections in immunocompromised individuals. Upon inhalation into the lungs C. neoformans differentiates into cells with altered size and morphology, including production of large titan cells. Titan cells possess thickened cell wall and dense, cross-linked capsule when compared to in vitro grown cells. In addition, titan cells have increased cell wall chitin that is associated with a detrimental anti-inflammatory immune response. Here we examined the cell wall and capsule composition of in vitro, in vivo typical-sized and in vivo titan cells using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The monomer composition of cell wall polysaccharides showed that in vivo C. neoformans cells contained more glucosamine and less glucose than in vitro cells, suggesting alteration in abundance of both chitin and glucans, respectively. Low levels of galactosamine were also detected in carbohydrates from both in vivo and vitro cells. Within the in vivo cell population, differences in the proportions of cell wall and capsule monomers between typical and titan cells were also observed. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C. neoformans reshapes its cell wall and capsule composition during infection. These cell wall and capsule alterations likely help C. neoformans escape recognition by, and allow modulation of, the host immune system.

Abstract: In this study we designed a composite biomaterial based on a high viscosity soft propolis extract (70% propolis) and shell clam, with antiseptic and osteoinductive qualities, that can be used in dentistry, orthopedics and other areas where hard tissue regeneration is needed. We assessed it in interaction with stabilized human cells isolated from dental papilla of wisdom teeth (D1MSCs). We performed detailed characterization of the obtained material by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. SEM investigation revealed the roughness and porosity of the shell, which acted like a scaffold, as it allowed cells to penetrate the pores, proliferate on the surface, spread and grow in the depressions provided by the substrate. in vitro cell viability, proliferation and differentiation assays showed that the newly obtain biomaterial presented low toxicity on D1MSCs and determined the development of numerous osteogenic nodules that were in a higher number even than in the specific induction medium. Our results demonstrated that the shell-propolis based biomaterial promoted and sustained human stem cells attachment, proliferation and differentiation, presenting an important osteoinductive effect essential for mineralized tissue reparation process.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells promote neoplastic growth, in part by deregulating asymmetric cell division and enhancing self-renewal. To uncover mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in glioma stem cell (GSC) self-renewal, we performed a genetic suppressor screen for kinases to reverse the tumor phenotype of our Drosophila brain tumor model and identified dCdk5 as a critical regulator. CDK5, the human ortholog of dCdk5 (79% identity), is aberrantly activated in GBMs and tightly aligned with both chromosome 7 gains and stem cell markers affecting tumor-propagation. Our investigation revealed that pharmaceutical inhibition of CDK5 prevents GSC self-renewal in vitro and in xenografted tumors, at least partially by suppressing CREB1 activation independently of PKA/cAMP. Finally, our TCGA GBM data analysis revealed that CDK5, stem cell, and asymmetric cell division markers segregate within non-mesenchymal patient clusters, which may indicate preferential dependence on CDK5 signaling and sensitivity to its inhibition in this group.

Abstract: Summary
Hfq is an RNA chaperone and an important post-transcriptional regulator in bacteria. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we show that Hfq associates with hundreds of different regions of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosome. These associations are abolished when transcription is inhibited, indicating that they reflect Hfq binding to transcripts during their synthesis. Analogous ChIP-seq analyses with the post-transcriptional regulator Crc reveal that it associates with many of the same nascent transcripts as Hfq, an activity we show is Hfq dependent. Our findings indicate that Hfq binds many transcripts co-transcriptionally in P. aeruginosa, often in concert with Crc, and uncover direct regulatory targets of these proteins. They also highlight a general approach for studying the interactions of RNA-binding proteins with nascent transcripts in bacteria. The binding of post-transcriptional regulators to nascent mRNAs may represent a prevalent means of controlling translation in bacteria where transcription and translation are coupled.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional co-activator Prdm16 controls brown fat development and white fat browning, but how this thermogenic function is modulated post-translationally is poorly understood. Here, we report that Cbx4, a Polycomb group protein, is a SUMO E3 ligase for Prdm16 and that Cbx4-mediated sumoylation of Prdm16 is required for thermogenic gene expression. Cbx4 expression is enriched in brown fat and is induced in adipose tissue by acute cold exposure. Sumoylation of Prdm16 at lysine 917 by Cbx4 blocks its ubiquitination-mediated degradation, thereby augmenting its stability and thermogenic function. Moreover, this sumoylation event primes Prdm16 to be further stabilized by methyltransferase Ehmt1. Heterozygous Cbx4-knockout mice develop metabolic phenotypes resembling those of Prdm16-knockout mice. Furthermore, fat-specific Cbx4 knockdown and overexpression produce remarkable, opposite effects on white fat remodeling. Our results identify a modifying enzyme for Prdm16, and they demonstrate a central role of Cbx4 in the control of Prdm16 stability and white fat browning.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays an important role in protecting our mucosal surfaces from viral infection, in maintaining a balance with the commensal bacterial flora, and in extending maternal immunity via breast feeding. Here, we report an additional innate immune effector function of human IgA molecules in that we demonstrate that the C-terminal tail unique to IgA molecules interferes with cell-surface attachment of influenza A and other enveloped viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. This antiviral activity is mediated by sialic acid found in the complex N-linked glycans at position 459. Antiviral activity was observed even in the absence of classical antibody binding via the antigen binding sites. Our data, therefore, show that the C-terminal tail of IgA subtypes provides an innate line of defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor and the role of neuraminidases present on these virions.

Abstract: Summary
Although the value of proteomics has been demonstrated, cost and scale are typically prohibitive, and gene expression profiling remains dominant for characterizing cellular responses to perturbations. However, high-throughput sentinel assays provide an opportunity for proteomics to contribute at a meaningful scale. We present a systematic library resource (90 drugs × 6 cell lines) of proteomic signatures that measure changes in the reduced-representation phosphoproteome (P100) and changes in epigenetic marks on histones (GCP). A majority of these drugs elicited reproducible signatures, but notable cell line- and assay-specific differences were observed. Using the "connectivity" framework, we compared signatures across cell types and integrated data across assays, including a transcriptional assay (L1000). Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended lineage, and consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs. We further leveraged the resource against public data to formulate hypotheses for treatment of multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
The complex architecture of neuronal networks in the brain requires tight control of the actin cytoskeleton. The actin nucleator Cobl is critical for neuronal morphogenesis. Here we reveal that Cobl is controlled by arginine methylation. Coprecipitations, coimmunoprecipitations, cellular reconstitutions, and in vitro reconstitutions demonstrated that Cobl associates with the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT2 in a Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain-dependent manner and that this promotes methylation of Cobl's actin nucleating C-terminal domain. Consistently, PRMT2 phenocopied Cobl functions in both gain- and loss-of-function studies. Both PRMT2- and Cobl-promoted dendritogenesis relied on methylation. PRMT2 effects require both its catalytic domain and SH3 domain. Cobl-mediated dendritic arborization required PRMT2, complex formation with PRMT2, and PRMT2's catalytic activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that Cobl methylation is key for Cobl actin binding. Therefore, arginine methylation is a regulatory mechanism reaching beyond controlling nuclear processes. It also controls a major, cytosolic, cytoskeletal component shaping neuronal cells.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory responses mediated by NOD2 rely on RIP2 kinase and ubiquitin ligase XIAP for the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and cytokine production. Herein, we demonstrate that selective XIAP antagonism blocks NOD2-mediated inflammatory signaling and cytokine production by interfering with XIAP-RIP2 binding, which removes XIAP from its ubiquitination substrate RIP2. We also establish that the kinase activity of RIP2 is dispensable for NOD2 signaling. Rather, the conformation of the RIP2 kinase domain functions to regulate binding to the XIAP-BIR2 domain. Effective RIP2 kinase inhibitors block NOD2 signaling by disrupting RIP2-XIAP interaction. Finally, we identify NOD2 signaling and XIAP-dependent ubiquitination sites on RIP2 and show that mutating these lysine residues adversely affects NOD2 pathway signaling. Overall, these results reveal a critical role for the XIAP-RIP2 interaction in NOD2 inflammatory signaling and provide a molecular basis for the design of innovative therapeutic strategies based on XIAP antagonists and RIP2 kinase inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast heterogeneity has long been recognized in mouse and human lungs, homeostasis, and disease states. However, there is no common consensus on fibroblast subtypes, lineages, biological properties, signaling, and plasticity, which severely hampers our understanding of the mechanisms of fibrosis. To comprehensively classify fibroblast populations in the lung using an unbiased approach, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed with mesenchymal preparations from either uninjured or bleomycin-treated mouse lungs. Single-cell transcriptome analyses classified and defined six mesenchymal cell types in normal lung and seven in fibrotic lung. Furthermore, delineation of their differentiation trajectory was achieved by a machine learning method. This collection of single-cell transcriptomes and the distinct classification of fibroblast subsets provide a new resource for understanding the fibroblast landscape and the roles of fibroblasts in fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Temperature influences the structural and functional properties of cellular components, necessitating stress responses to restore homeostasis following temperature shift. Whereas the circuitry controlling the heat shock response is well understood, that controlling the E. coli cold shock adaptation program is not. We found that during the growth arrest phase (acclimation) that follows shift to low temperature, protein synthesis increases, and open reading frame (ORF)-wide mRNA secondary structure decreases. To identify the regulatory system controlling this process, we screened for players required for increased translation. We identified a two-member mRNA surveillance system that enables recovery of translation during acclimation: RNase R assures appropriate mRNA degradation and the Csps dynamically adjust mRNA secondary structure to globally modulate protein expression level. An autoregulatory switch in which Csps tune their own expression to cellular demand enables dynamic control of global translation. The universality of Csps in bacteria suggests broad utilization of this control mechanism.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in men around the world. Due to its high incidence, new therapies have been evaluated, including drugs capable of inhibiting the FGF/VEGF pathways, as Nintedanib. The aim herein was to evaluate the Nintedanib therapeutic effects on morphology and COX-2 and IL-17 levels in the prostate anterior lobe in different grades of the tumor progression in TRAMP mice. Animals were treated with Nintedanib at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in initial and intermediate grades of tumor development. At the end of treatment, the prostate anterior lobe was collected and submitted to morphological, immunohistochemical and Western Blotting analyses. The results showed that Nintedanib delayed the prostate carcinogenesis progression, with over 20% of reduction in frequency of tissue injuries, particularly in the group treated from 12 to 16 weeks of age. Also, decreased COX-2 and IL-17 levels were observed in both groups treated with Nintedanib in the prostate anterior lobe. Thus, we concluded that Nintedanib was effective in delaying tumor progression and, despite not directly acting on inflammation, Nintedanib may adversely affect inflammatory pathways, favoring prostate cancer delay.

Abstract: Background
Despite significant achievements in the field of tissue engineering, simplification and improvement of the existing protocols are of great importance. The use of complex differentiation media, due to the presence of multiple factors, may have some undesired effects on cell health and functions. Thus, minimizing the number of involved factors, while maintaining the differentiation efficiency, provides less costly and controllable conditions. Adipose-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), the adult stem cells present in adipose tissue, can be a suitable source of stem cells due to abundant and ease of access. The aim of this study is to optimize the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs by chemical composition of scaffold, in the first step, and then by electromagnetic treatments.
Methods
ASCs were cultured on PVA/PES scaffold and tissue culture polystyrene surfaces (TCPS) and osteogenic differentiation was performed with either osteogenic medium, or electromagnetic field or both. The impact of each treatment on ASCs growth and proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Changes in gene expression levels of osteogenic-specific markers including ALP and RUNX2 were determined by Real Time PCR. Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition were measured.
Results
The MTT assay showed the significant effects on cell growth and respiration in scaffold-seeded ASCs treated with electromagnetic field, compared to control TCPS plate. Also, the electromagnetic treatment, increased alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Finally, Real Time PCR showed higher expression of ALP and RUNX2 genes in electromagnetic field groups compared to control groups.
Conclusion
It can be concluded that PVA/PES scaffold used in this study improved the osteogenic capacity of ASCs. Moreover, the osteogenic potential of ASCs seeded on PVA/PES scaffold could be augmented by electromagnetic field without any chemical stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota alters energy homeostasis. In parallel, metformin regulates upper small intestinal sodium glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1), but whether changes of the microbiota or SGLT1-dependent pathways in the upper small intestine mediate metformin action is unknown. Here we report that upper small intestinal glucose sensing triggers an SGLT1-dependent pathway to lower glucose production in rodents. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding reduces glucose sensing and SGLT1 expression in the upper small intestine. Upper small intestinal metformin treatment restores SGLT1 expression and glucose sensing while shifting the upper small intestinal microbiota partly by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus. Transplantation of upper small intestinal microbiota from metformin-treated HFD rats to the upper small intestine of untreated HFD rats also increases the upper small intestinal abundance of Lactobacillus and glucose sensing via an upregulation of SGLT1 expression. Thus, we demonstrate that metformin alters upper small intestinal microbiota and impacts a glucose-SGLT1-sensing glucoregulatory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is the most commonly mutated gene in grade II–III glioma and secondary glioblastoma (GBM). A causal role for IDH1R132H in gliomagenesis has been proposed, but functional validation in vivo has not been demonstrated. In this study, we assessed the role of IDH1R132H in glioma development in the context of clinically relevant cooperating genetic alterations in vitro and in vivo. Immortal astrocytes expressing IDH1R132H exhibited elevated (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate levels, reduced NADPH, increased proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. Although not sufficient on its own, IDH1R132H cooperated with PDGFA and loss of Cdkn2a, Atrx, and Pten to promote glioma development in vivo. These tumors resembled proneural human mutant IDH1 GBM genetically, histologically, and functionally. Our findings support the hypothesis that IDH1R132H promotes glioma development. This model enhances our understanding of the biology of IDH1R132H-driven gliomas and facilitates testing of therapeutic strategies designed to combat this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are master regulators of systemic metabolism. Intriguingly, Cushing’s syndrome, a disorder of excessive GCs, phenocopies several menopause-induced metabolic pathologies. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) drives steatosis in hypogonadal female mice because hepatocyte-specific GR knockout mice are refractory to developing ovariectomy-induced steatosis. Intriguingly, transcriptional profiling revealed that ovariectomy elicits hepatic GC hypersensitivity globally. Hypogonadism-induced GC hypersensitivity results from a loss of systemic but not hepatic estrogen (E2) signaling, given that hepatocyte-specific E2 receptor deletion does not confer GC hypersensitivity. Mechanistically, enhanced chromatin recruitment and ligand-dependent hyperphosphorylation of GR underlie ovariectomy-induced glucocorticoid hypersensitivity. The dysregulated glucocorticoid-mediated signaling present in hypogonadal females is a product of increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production because FSH treatment in ovary-intact mice recapitulates glucocorticoid hypersensitivity similar to hypogonadal female mice. Our findings uncover a regulatory axis between estradiol, FSH, and hepatic glucocorticoid receptor signaling that, when disrupted, as in menopause, promotes hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) fill synaptic vesicles with glutamate and are thus essential for glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, VGLUTs were originally discovered as members of a transporter subfamily specific for inorganic phosphate (Pi). It is still unclear how VGLUTs accommodate glutamate transport coupled to an electrochemical proton gradient ΔμH+ with inversely directed Pi transport coupled to the Na+ gradient and the membrane potential. Using both functional reconstitution and heterologous expression, we show that VGLUT transports glutamate and Pi using a single substrate binding site but different coupling to cation gradients. When facing the cytoplasm, both ions are transported into synaptic vesicles in a ΔμH+-dependent fashion, with glutamate preferred over Pi. When facing the extracellular space, Pi is transported in a Na+-coupled manner, with glutamate competing for binding but at lower affinity. We conclude that VGLUTs have dual functions in both vesicle transmitter loading and Pi homeostasis within glutamatergic neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in patterning during human embryonic development frequently result in craniofacial abnormalities. The gene regulatory programs that build the craniofacial complex are likely controlled by information located between genes and within intronic sequences. However, systematic identification of regulatory sequences important for forming the human face has not been performed. Here, we describe comprehensive epigenomic annotations from human embryonic craniofacial tissues and systematic comparisons with multiple tissues and cell types. We identified thousands of tissue-specific craniofacial regulatory sequences and likely causal regions for rare craniofacial abnormalities. We demonstrate significant enrichment of common variants associated with orofacial clefting in enhancers active early in embryonic development, while those associated with normal facial variation are enriched near the end of the embryonic period. These data are provided in easily accessible formats for both craniofacial researchers and clinicians to aid future experimental design and interpretation of noncoding variation in those affected by craniofacial abnormalities.

Abstract: Summary
The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) participates in inflammatory and oncogenic signaling by conjugating linear ubiquitin chains to target proteins. LUBAC consists of the catalytic HOIP subunit and two accessory subunits, HOIL-1L and SHARPIN. Interactions between the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains of HOIP and the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains of two accessory subunits are involved in LUBAC stabilization, but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of stable trimeric LUBAC remain elusive. We solved the co-crystal structure of the binding regions of the trimeric LUBAC complex and found that LUBAC-tethering motifs (LTMs) located N terminally to the UBL domains of HOIL-1L and SHARPIN heterodimerize and fold into a single globular domain. This interaction is resistant to dissociation and plays a critical role in stabilizing trimeric LUBAC. Inhibition of LTM-mediated HOIL-1L/SHARPIN dimerization profoundly attenuated the function of LUBAC, suggesting LTM as a superior target of LUBAC destabilization for anticancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) is a secreted enzyme critical for host defense. We discover an intrinsic RNase function, serving as a ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The closely related bovine RNase A and human RNase 5 (angiogenin [ANG]) can trigger oncogenic transformation independently of their catalytic activities via direct association with EGFR. Notably, high plasma ANG level in PDAC patients is positively associated with response to EGFR inhibitor erlotinib treatment. These results identify a role of ANG as a serum biomarker that may be used to stratify patients for EGFR-targeted therapies, and offer insights into the ligand-receptor relationship between RNase and RTK families.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is elevated in the circulation during obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) but is decreased in islets from patients with T2D. The protective role of local IL-1Ra was investigated in pancreatic islet β cell (βIL-1Ra)-specific versus myeloid-cell (myeloIL-1Ra)-specific IL-1Ra knockout (KO) mice. Deletion of IL-1Ra in β cells, but not in myeloid cells, resulted in diminished islet IL-1Ra expression. Myeloid cells were not the main source of circulating IL-1Ra in obesity. βIL-1Ra KO mice had impaired insulin secretion, reduced β cell proliferation, and decreased expression of islet proliferation genes, along with impaired glucose tolerance. The key cell-cycle regulator E2F1 partly reversed IL-1β-mediated inhibition of potassium channel Kir6.2 expression and rescued impaired insulin secretion in IL-1Ra knockout islets. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of β cell-derived IL-1Ra for the local defense of β cells to maintain normal function and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The intestine has direct contact with nutritional information. The mechanisms by which particular dietary molecules affect intestinal homeostasis are not fully understood. In this study, we identified S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor synthesized from dietary methionine, as a critical molecule that regulates stem cell division in Drosophila midgut. Depletion of either dietary methionine or SAM synthesis reduces division rate of intestinal stem cells. Genetic screening for putative SAM-dependent methyltransferases has identified protein synthesis as a regulator of the stem cells, partially through a unique diphthamide modification on eukaryotic elongation factor 2. In contrast, SAM in nutrient-absorptive enterocytes controls the interleukin-6-like protein Unpaired 3, which is required for rapid division of the stem cells after refeeding. Our study sheds light upon a link between diet and intestinal homeostasis and highlights the key metabolite SAM as a mediator of cell-type-specific starvation response.

Abstract: Summary
Polyphosphates (polyP) are chains of inorganic phosphates found in all cells. Previous work has implicated these chains in diverse functions, but the mechanism of action is unclear. A recent study reports that polyP can be non-enzymatically and covalently attached to lysine residues on yeast proteins Nsr1 and Top1. One question emerging from this work is whether so-called “polyphosphorylation” is unique to these proteins or instead functions as a global regulator akin to other lysine post-translational modifications. Here, we present the results of a screen for polyphosphorylated proteins in yeast. We uncovered 15 targets including a conserved network of proteins functioning in ribosome biogenesis. Multiple genes contribute to polyphosphorylation of targets by regulating polyP synthesis, and disruption of this synthesis results in translation defects as measured by polysome profiling. Finally, we identify 6 human proteins that can be modified by polyP, highlighting the therapeutic potential of manipulating polyphosphorylation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Normal brain functions depend on the balanced development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibitory synapse formation is limited. Neuroligin-2 (NL2), a transmembrane protein at inhibitory postsynaptic sites, is capable of initiating inhibitory synapse formation. In an effort to search for NL2 binding proteins and the downstream mechanisms responsible for inhibitory synapse development, we identify LHFPL4/GARLH4 as a major NL2 binding partner that is specifically enriched at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. LHFPL4/GARLH4 and NL2 regulate the protein levels and synaptic clustering of each other in the cerebellum. Lhfpl4/Garlh4−/− mice display profound impairment of inhibitory synapse formation as well as prominent motor behavioral deficits and premature death. Our findings highlight the essential role of LHFPL4/GARLH4 in brain functions by regulating inhibitory synapse formation as a major NL2 binding partner.

Abstract: Summary
Modern single-cell technologies allow multiplexed sampling of cellular states within a tissue. However, computational tools that can infer developmental cell-state transitions reproducibly from such single-cell data are lacking. Here, we introduce p-Creode, an unsupervised algorithm that produces multi-branching graphs from single-cell data, compares graphs with differing topologies, and infers a statistically robust hierarchy of cell-state transitions that define developmental trajectories. We have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq data. As a test case, we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the Atoh1-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine. However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells arise from an alternative, Atoh1-driven developmental program in the colon. These studies introduce p-Creode as a reliable method for analyzing large datasets that depict branching transition trajectories.

Abstract: Summary
Meningioma is the most common primary intracranial tumor, but the molecular drivers of aggressive meningioma are incompletely understood. Using 280 human meningioma samples and RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, whole-exome sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, and targeted gene expression profiling, we comprehensively define the molecular profile of aggressive meningioma. Transcriptomic analyses identify FOXM1 as a key transcription factor for meningioma proliferation and a marker of poor clinical outcomes. Consistently, we discover genomic and epigenomic factors associated with FOXM1 activation in aggressive meningiomas. Finally, we define a FOXM1/Wnt signaling axis in meningioma that is associated with a mitotic gene expression program, poor clinical outcomes, and proliferation of primary meningioma cells. In summary, we find that multiple molecular mechanisms converge on a FOXM1/Wnt signaling axis in aggressive meningioma.

Abstract: Summary
In plants, the phytohormone auxin acts as a master regulator of developmental processes and environmental responses. The best characterized process in the auxin regulatory network occurs at the subcellular scale, wherein auxin mediates signal transduction into transcriptional programs by triggering the degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins in the nucleus. However, whether and how auxin movement between the nucleus and the surrounding compartments is regulated remain elusive. Using a fluorescent auxin analog, we show that its diffusion into the nucleus is restricted. By combining mathematical modeling with time course assays on auxin-mediated nuclear signaling and quantitative phenotyping in single plant cell systems, we show that ER-to-nucleus auxin flux represents a major subcellular pathway to directly control nuclear auxin levels. Our findings propose that the homeostatically regulated auxin pool in the ER and ER-to-nucleus auxin fluxes underpin auxin-mediated downstream responses in plant cells.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are indispensable for the establishment of tolerance of self-antigens in animals. The transcriptional regulator Foxp3 is critical for Treg development and function, controlling the expression of genes important for Tregs through interactions with binding partners. We previously reported KAP1 as a binding partner of FOXP3 in human Tregs, but the mechanisms by which KAP1 affects Treg function were unclear. In this study, we analyzed mice with Treg-specific deletion of KAP1 and found that they develop spontaneous autoimmune disease. KAP1-deficient Tregs failed to induce Foxp3-regulated Treg signature genes. In addition, KAP1-deficient Tregs were less proliferative due to the decreased expression of Slc1a5, whose expression was KAP1 dependent but Foxp3 independent. This reduced expression of Slc1a5 resulted in reduced mTORC1 activation. Thus, our data suggest that KAP1 regulates Treg function in a Foxp3-dependent manner and also controls Treg proliferation in a Foxp3-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Excess plasma triglycerides (TGs) are a key component of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. We have shown that γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment improves glucose tolerance due to inhibition of hepatic Notch signaling but found additional Notch-independent reduction of plasma TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in GSI-treated, as well as hepatocyte-specific, γ-secretase knockout (L-Ncst) mice, which suggested a primary effect on hepatocyte TRL uptake. Indeed, we found increased VLDL and LDL particle uptake in L-Ncst hepatocytes and Ncst-deficient hepatoma cells, in part through reduced γ-secretase-mediated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) cleavage and degradation. To exploit this novel finding, we generated a liver-selective Nicastrin ASO, which recapitulated glucose and lipid improvements of L-Ncst mice, with increased levels of hepatocyte LDLR. Collectively, these results identify the role of hepatic γ-secretase to regulate LDLR and suggest that liver-specific GSIs may simultaneously improve multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Protein glycosylation provides proteomic diversity in regulating protein localization, stability, and activity; it remains largely unknown whether the sugar moiety contributes to immunosuppression. In the study of immune receptor glycosylation, we showed that EGF induces programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) interaction, requiring β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (B3GNT3) expression in triple-negative breast cancer. Downregulation of B3GNT3 enhances cytotoxic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. A monoclonal antibody targeting glycosylated PD-L1 (gPD-L1) blocks PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and promotes PD-L1 internalization and degradation. In addition to immune reactivation, drug-conjugated gPD-L1 antibody induces a potent cell-killing effect as well as a bystander-killing effect on adjacent cancer cells lacking PD-L1 expression without any detectable toxicity. Our work suggests targeting protein glycosylation as a potential strategy to enhance immune checkpoint therapy.

Abstract: Type-2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) play a pivotal role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by releasing Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via a Ca2+ -induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. Two strategies have been used to study the structure-function characteristics of RyR2 and its disease associated mutations: (1) heterologous cell expression of the recombinant mutant RyR2s, and (2) knock-in mouse models harboring RyR2 point mutations. Here, we establish an alternative approach where Ca2+ signaling aberrancy caused by the RyR2 mutation is studied in human cardiomyocytes with robust CICR mechanism. Specifically, we introduce point mutations in wild-type RYR2 of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and then differentiate them into cardiomyocytes. To verify the reliability of this approach, we introduced the same disease-associated RyR2 mutation, F2483I, which was studied by us in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from a patient biopsy. The gene-edited F2483I hiPSC-CMs exhibited longer and wandering Ca2+ sparks, elevated diastolic Ca2+ leaks, and smaller SR Ca2+ stores, like those of patient-derived cells. Our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach validated the feasibility of creating myocytes expressing the various RyR2 mutants, making comparative mechanistic analysis and pharmacotherapeutic approaches for RyR2 pathologies possible.

Abstract: Summary
Resilience and vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders are linked to molecular changes underlying excitability that are still poorly understood. Here, we identify glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.6 as regulators of neuroplasticity induced by environmentally enriched (EC) or isolated (IC) conditions—models for resilience and vulnerability. Transcriptomic studies in the nucleus accumbens from EC and IC rats predicted low levels of GSK3β and SCN8A mRNA as a protective phenotype associated with reduced excitability in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In vivo genetic manipulations demonstrate that GSK3β and Nav1.6 are molecular determinants of MSN excitability and that silencing of GSK3β prevents maladaptive plasticity of IC MSNs. In vitro studies reveal direct interaction of GSK3β with Nav1.6 and phosphorylation at Nav1.6T1936 by GSK3β. A GSK3β-Nav1.6T1936 competing peptide reduces MSNs excitability in IC, but not EC rats. These results identify GSK3β regulation of Nav1.6 as a biosignature of MSNs maladaptive plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular transport of membranous organelles and protein complexes to various destinations is fundamental to signaling transduction and cellular function. The cytoplasmic dynein motor and its regulatory proteins LIS1 and NDE1 are required for transporting a variety of cellular cargos along the microtubule network. In this study, we show that deletion of Lis1 in developing lung endoderm and limb mesenchymal cells causes agenesis of the lungs and limbs. In both mutants, there is increased cell death and decreased fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling activity. Mechanistically, LIS1 and its interacting protein NDE1/NDEL1 are associated with FGF receptor-containing vesicles and regulate FGF receptor intracellular trafficking and degradation. Notably, FGF signaling promotes NDE1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to dissociation of LIS1/NDE1 complex. Thus, our studies identify the LIS1/NDE1 complex as an important FGF signaling regulator and provide insights into the bidirectional regulation of cell signaling and transport machinery for endocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary supplements such as vitamins and minerals are widely used in the hope of improving health but may have unidentified risks and side effects. In particular, a pathogenic link between dietary supplements and specific oncogenes remains unknown. Here we report that chondroitin-4-sulfate (CHSA), a natural glycosaminoglycan approved as a dietary supplement used for osteoarthritis, selectively promotes the tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in patient- and cell line-derived xenograft mice and confers resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Mechanistically, chondroitin sulfate glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcA-T) signals through its product CHSA to enhance casein kinase 2 (CK2)-PTEN binding and consequent phosphorylation and inhibition of PTEN, which requires CHSA chains and is essential to sustain AKT activation in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma cells. However, this CHSA-dependent PTEN inhibition is dispensable in cancer cells expressing mutant NRAS or PI3KCA, which directly activate the PI3K-AKT pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Glycoproteins engaged in unproductive folding in the ER are marked for degradation by a signal generated by progressive demannosylation of substrate N-glycans that is decoded by ER lectins, but how the two lectins, OS9 and XTP3B, contribute to non-glycosylated protein triage is unknown. We generated cell lines with homozygous deletions of both lectins individually and in combination. We found that OS9 and XTP3B redundantly promote glycoprotein degradation and stabilize the SEL1L/HRD1 dislocon complex, that XTP3B profoundly inhibits the degradation of non-glycosylated proteins, and that OS9 antagonizes this inhibition. The relative expression of OS9 and XTP3B and the distribution of glycan and non-glycan degrons within the same protein contribute to the fidelity and processivity of glycoprotein triage and, therefore, determine the fates of newly synthesized proteins in the early secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Reorganization of the neurovascular unit has been suggested in the epileptic brain, although the dynamics and functional significance remain unclear. Here, we tracked the in vivo dynamics of perivascular mural cells as a function of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity following status epilepticus. We segmented the cortical vascular bed to provide a size- and type-specific analysis of mural cell plasticity topologically. We find that mural cells are added and removed from veins, arterioles, and capillaries after seizure induction. Loss of mural cells is proportional to seizure severity and vascular pathology (e.g., rigidity, perfusion, and permeability). Treatment with platelet-derived growth factor subunits BB (PDGF-BB) reduced mural cell loss, vascular pathology, and epileptiform EEG activity. We propose that perivascular mural cells play a pivotal role in seizures and are potential targets for reducing pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
We use super-resolution interferometric photoactivation and localization microscopy (iPALM) and a constrained photoactivatable fluorescent protein integrin fusion to measure the displacement of the head of integrin lymphocyte function-associated 1 (LFA-1) resulting from integrin conformational change on the cell surface. We demonstrate that the distance of the LFA-1 head increases substantially between basal and ligand-engaged conformations, which can only be explained at the molecular level by integrin extension. We further demonstrate that one class of integrin antagonist maintains the bent conformation, while another antagonist class induces extension. Our molecular scale measurements on cell-surface LFA-1 are in excellent agreement with distances derived from crystallographic and electron microscopy structures of bent and extended integrins. Our distance measurements are also in excellent agreement with a previous model of LFA-1 bound to ICAM-1 derived from the orientation of LFA-1 on the cell surface measured using fluorescence polarization microscopy.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies are a main player in modern drug discovery. Many antibody screening formats exist, each with specific advantages and limitations. Nonetheless, it remains challenging to screen antibodies for the binding of cell-surface receptors (the most important class of all drug targets) or for the binding to target cells rather than purified proteins. Here, we present a high-throughput droplet microfluidics approach employing dual-color normalized fluorescence readout to detect antibody binding. This enables us to obtain quantitative data on target cell recognition, using as little as 33 fg of IgG per assay. Starting with an excess of hybridoma cells releasing unspecific antibodies, individual clones secreting specific binders (of target cells co-encapsulated into droplets) could be enriched 220-fold after sorting 80,000 clones in a single experiment. This opens the way for therapeutic antibody discovery, especially since the single-cell approach is in principle also applicable to primary human plasma cells.

Abstract: The present study was designed to determine the distribution, morphology and co-localization of calbindin-D28k (CB) with other neuroactive substances in the coeliac-cranial mesenteric ganglion complex (CCMG) neurons supplying the prepyloric region of the porcine stomach. In all animals, a median laparotomy was performed and the fluorescent retrograde neuronal tracer Fast Blue was injected into the wall of the stomach prepyloric area. On the 28th day, all animals were euthanized and the CCMG complexes were then collected and processed for double-labelling immunofluorescence for CB and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), galanin (GAL), somatostatin (SOM), leu 5-enkephalin (LENK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P (SP) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART), Immunohistochemistry revealed that 8.27±0.51% of FB-positive neurons expressed CB-like immunoreactivity. Furthermore, CB co-localized with TH, GAL and SOM in retrogradely labelled cell bodies, whereas CART, LENK, VIP and SP were detected only in nerve terminals surrounding FB+/CB+ neurons. The presence of CB in the stomach-projecting neurons may indicate the contribution of CB in the sympathetic regulation of the stomach function. Furthermore, CB-LI neurons had a catecholaminergic character and co-localized with TH, GAL and SOM, which suggests multiple functions of this neuroactive substance in the CCMG neurons supplying the porcine prepyloric area.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus is associated with the formation of R-loop structures over switch (S) regions. While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent RNA and template DNA, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting AID to IgH S-regions. This depends on the RNA helicase DDX1 that is also required for CSR in vivo. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops. This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme AID to S-regions so promoting CSR. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 RNA or by the expression of a DDX1 ATPase-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce CSR efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote CSR in the IgH locus.

Abstract: Dental pulp is a highly vascularized tissue with a high regenerative capacity. This is attributed to its unique blood supply and the presence of progenitor or postnatal dental pulp stem cells. Here we aimed to isolate and compare the angiogenic properties of endothelial cells (EC) prepared from mouse dental pulp and periodontal ligament (PDL). EC were isolated from 4-week-old wild type immorto mice. Mice were sacrificed and after mandible isolation, the molar and incisor teeth and the PDL from molar teeth were dissected. EC were prepared by collagenase digestion of tissues and affinity purification using magnetic beads coated with platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) antibody. EC prepared from incisor and molar pulps and PDL were examined for expression of appropriate markers by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The proliferation, migration, and capillary morphogenesis of EC were evaluated. Ex vivo sprouting angiogenesis from various tissues was also compared. Data were analyzed at the level of significance of P<0.05. Pulp EC prepared from incisors proliferated and migrated significantly faster than molar and PDL EC (P<0.05). In addition, molar and PDL EC formed a more extensive capillary network when plated on Matrigel. This is consistent with the lower proliferative and migratory characteristics of these cells compared with incisor EC (P<0.05). However, PDL tissue showed significantly more sprouting area than molar and incisor pulp tissues (P<0.05). Thus, pulp EC from molar and incisor and PDL EC present different proangiogenic properties. Collectively our results suggest that EC from different tooth tissue have unique characteristics related to their target tissue and function.

Abstract: Primary cilia are solitary, non-motile, axonemal microtubule-based antenna-like organelles that project from the plasma membrane of most mammalian cells and are implicated in transducing hedgehog signals during development. It was recently proposed that aberrant SHH signaling may be implicated in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the distribution and role of primary cilia in IPF remains unclear. Here, we clearly observed the primary cilia in alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells of human normal lung tissue. Then, we investigated the distribution of primary cilia in human IPF tissue samples using immunofluorescence. Tissues from six IPF cases showed an increase in the number of primary cilia in alveolar cells and fibroblasts. In addition, we observed an increase in ciliogenesis related genes such as IFT20 and IFT88 in IPF. Since major components of the SHH signaling pathway are known to be localized in primary cilia, we quantified the mRNA expression of the SHH signaling components using qRT-PCR in both IPF and control lung. mRNA levels of SHH, the coreceptor SMO, and the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2 were upregulated in IPF compared with control. Furthermore, the nuclear localization of GLI1 was observed mainly in alveolar epithelia and fibroblasts. In addition, we showed that defective KIF3A-mediated ciliary loss in human type II alveolar epithelial cell lines leads to disruption of SHH signaling. These results indicate that a significant increase in the number of primary cilia in IPF contributes to the upregulation of SHH signals.

Abstract: This study describes the effects of a promising therapeutic alternative for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) based on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy combined with Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in an animal model. Furthermore, this study describes the possible mechanisms of this therapeutic combination involving Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 signaling pathways. NMIBC was induced by treating female Fischer 344 rats with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). After treatment with MNU, the animals were distributed into four experimental groups: Control (without MNU) group, MNU (cancer) group, MNU + PRP group, MNU + BCG group and MNU + PRP + BCG group. Our results demonstrated that PRP treatment alone or associated with BCG triggered significant cytotoxicity in bladder carcinoma cells (HTB-9). Animals treated with PRP associated to BCG clearly showed better histopathological recovery from the cancer state and decrease of urothelial neoplastic lesions progression in 70% of animals when compared to groups that received the same therapies administered singly. In addition, this therapeutic association led to distinct activation of immune system TLRs 2 and 4-mediated, resulting in increased MyD88, TRIF, IRF3, IFN-γ immunoreactivities. Taken together, the data obtained suggest that interferon signaling pathway activation by PRP treatment in combination with BCG immunotherapy may provide novel therapeutic approaches for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Intermittent fasting (IF) improves cardiometabolic health; however, it is unknown whether these effects are due solely to weight loss. We conducted the first supervised controlled feeding trial to test whether IF has benefits independent of weight loss by feeding participants enough food to maintain their weight. Our proof-of-concept study also constitutes the first trial of early time-restricted feeding (eTRF), a form of IF that involves eating early in the day to be in alignment with circadian rhythms in metabolism. Men with prediabetes were randomized to eTRF (6-hr feeding period, with dinner before 3 p.m.) or a control schedule (12-hr feeding period) for 5 weeks and later crossed over to the other schedule. eTRF improved insulin sensitivity, β cell responsiveness, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and appetite. We demonstrate for the first time in humans that eTRF improves some aspects of cardiometabolic health and that IF’s effects are not solely due to weight loss.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient insulin secretion requires a well-functioning pancreatic islet microvasculature. The dense network of islet capillaries includes the islet pericyte, a cell that has barely been studied. Here we show that islet pericytes help control local blood flow by adjusting islet capillary diameter. Islet pericytes cover 40% of the microvasculature, are contractile, and are innervated by sympathetic axons. Sympathetic adrenergic input increases pericyte activity and reduces capillary diameter and local blood flow. By contrast, activating beta cells by increasing glucose concentration inhibits pericytes, dilates islet capillaries, and increases local blood flow. These effects on pericytes are mediated by endogenous adenosine, which is likely derived from ATP co-released with insulin. Pericyte coverage of islet capillaries drops drastically in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that, under diabetic conditions, islets lose this mechanism to control their own blood supply. This may lead to inadequate insulin release into the circulation, further deteriorating glycemic control.

Abstract: Summary
The Ser/Thr protein kinase mTOR controls metabolic pathways, including the catabolic process of autophagy. Autophagy plays additional, catabolism-independent roles in homeostasis of cytoplasmic endomembranes and whole organelles. How signals from endomembrane damage are transmitted to mTOR to orchestrate autophagic responses is not known. Here we show that mTOR is inhibited by lysosomal damage. Lysosomal damage, recognized by galectins, leads to association of galectin-8 (Gal8) with the mTOR apparatus on the lysosome. Gal8 inhibits mTOR activity through its Ragulator-Rag signaling machinery, whereas galectin-9 activates AMPK in response to lysosomal injury. Both systems converge upon downstream effectors including autophagy and defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, a novel galectin-based signal-transduction system, termed here GALTOR, intersects with the known regulators of mTOR on the lysosome and controls them in response to lysosomal damage.

Abstract: Summary
The activation of brown/beige adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism and the induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression are essential for BAT-based strategies to improve metabolic homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that BAT utilizes actomyosin machinery to generate tensional responses following adrenergic stimulation, similar to muscle tissues. The activation of actomyosin mechanics is critical for the acute induction of oxidative metabolism and uncoupled respiration in UCP1+ adipocytes. Moreover, we show that actomyosin-mediated elasticity regulates the thermogenic capacity of adipocytes via the mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, which are indispensable for normal BAT function. These biomechanical signaling mechanisms may inform future strategies to promote the expansion and activation of brown/beige adipocytes.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the cellular basis of behavior, it is necessary to know the cell types that exist in the nervous system and their contributions to function. Spinal networks are essential for sensory processing and motor behavior and provide a powerful system for identifying the cellular correlates of behavior. Here, we used massively parallel single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to create an atlas of the adult mouse lumbar spinal cord. We identified and molecularly characterized 43 neuronal populations. Next, we leveraged the snRNA-seq approach to provide unbiased identification of neuronal populations that were active following a sensory and a motor behavior, using a transcriptional signature of neuronal activity. This approach can be used in the future to link single nucleus gene expression data with dynamic biological responses to behavior, injury, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Overall shared DNA methylation patterns between senescence (Sen) and cancers have led to the model that tumor-promoting epigenetic patterns arise through senescence. We show that transformation-associated methylation changes arise stochastically and independently of programmatic changes during senescence. Promoter hypermethylation events in transformation involve primarily pro-survival and developmental genes, similarly modified in primary tumors. Senescence-associated hypermethylation mainly involves metabolic regulators and appears early in proliferating “near-senescent” cells, which can be immortalized but are refractory to transformation. Importantly, a subset of transformation-associated hypermethylated developmental genes exhibits highest methylation gains at all age-associated cancer risk states across tissue types. These epigenetic changes favoring cell self-renewal and survival, arising during tissue aging, are fundamentally important for stratifying cancer risk and concepts for cancer prevention.

Abstract: Summary
In the ribosome complex, tRNA is a critical element of mRNA translation. A rich repertoire of cell regulation is hypothesized to occur during the recruitment of specific tRNAs in polypeptide formation. However, this basic question in nascent chain biology remains unaddressed due to the lack of technologies to report the complete tRNA complement inside ribosomes during active translation. Here, we characterize a technique for profiling ribosome-embedded tRNA and their modifications. With this method, we generated a comprehensive survey of the quantity and quality of intra-ribosomal tRNAs. In cells under environmental stress, we show that methionine tRNA inside ribosomes is a robust biomarker for the impairment of translation initiation or elongation steps. Concurrent tRNA/mRNA ribosome profiling revealed a stress-dependent incorporation of damaged and uncharged tRNAs into ribosomes causing translation arrest. Thus, tRNA ribosome profiling can provide insights on translation control mechanisms in diverse biological contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Steroid hormone receptors are simultaneously active in many tissues and are capable of altering each other’s function. Estrogen receptor α (ER) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are expressed in the uterus, and their ligands have opposing effects on uterine growth. In endometrial tumors with high ER expression, we surprisingly found that expression of GR is associated with poor prognosis. Dexamethasone reduced normal uterine growth in vivo; however, this growth inhibition was abolished in estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. We observed low genomic-binding site overlap when ER and GR are induced with their respective ligands; however, upon simultaneous induction they co-occupy more sites. GR binding is altered significantly by estradiol with GR recruited to ER-bound loci that become more accessible upon estradiol induction. Gene expression responses to co-treatment were more similar to estradiol but with additional regulated genes. Our results suggest phenotypic and molecular interplay between ER and GR in endometrial cancer.

Abstract: High mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) is an abundant, chromatin-associated, non-histone protein involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, and recombination. Recently, the HMGB2 gene was found to be significantly downregulated during senescence and shown to regulate the expression of senescent-associated secretory proteins. Here, we demonstrate that HMGB2 transcription is repressed by p21 during radiation-induced senescence through the ATM-p53-p21 DNA damage signaling cascade. The loss of p21 abolished the downregulation of HMGB2 caused by ionizing radiation, and the conditional induction of p21 was sufficient to repress the transcription of HMGB2. We also showed that the p21 protein binds to the HMGB2 promoter region, leading to sequestration of RNA polymerase and transcription factors E2F1, Sp1, and p300. In contrast, NF-Y, a CCAAT box-binding protein complex, is required for the expression of HMGB2, but NF-Y binding to the HMGB2 promoter was unaffected by either radiation or p21 induction. A proximity ligation assay results confirmed that the chromosome binding of E2F1 and Sp1 was inhibited by p21 induction. As HMGB2 have been shown to regulate premature senescence by IR, targeting the p21-mediated repression of HMGB2 could be a strategy to overcome the detrimental effects of radiation-induced senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclei are actively positioned and anchored to the cytoskeleton via the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex. We identified mutations in the Parkin-like E3 ubiquitin ligase Ariadne-1 (Ari-1) that affect the localization and distribution of LINC complex members in Drosophila. ari-1 mutants exhibit nuclear clustering and morphology defects in larval muscles. We show that Ari-1 mono-ubiquitinates the core LINC complex member Koi. Surprisingly, we discovered functional redundancy between Parkin and Ari-1: increasing Parkin expression rescues ari-1 mutant phenotypes and vice versa. We further show that rare variants in the human homolog of ari-1 (ARIH1) are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, conditions resulting from smooth muscle cell (SMC) dysfunction. Human ARIH1 rescues fly ari-1 mutant phenotypes, whereas human variants found in patients fail to do so. In addition, SMCs obtained from patients display aberrant nuclear morphology. Hence, ARIH1 is critical in anchoring myonuclei to the cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear RNA metabolism is influenced by protein complexes connecting to both RNA-productive and -destructive pathways. The ZC3H18 protein binds the cap-binding complex (CBC), universally present on capped RNAs, while also associating with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, linking to RNA decay. To dissect ZC3H18 function, we conducted interaction screening and mutagenesis of the protein, which revealed a phosphorylation-dependent isoform. Surprisingly, the modified region of ZC3H18 associates with core histone proteins. Further examination of ZC3H18 function, by genome-wide analyses, demonstrated its impact on transcription of a subset of protein-coding genes. This activity requires the CBC-interacting domain of the protein, with some genes being also dependent on the NEXT- and/or histone-interacting domains. Our data shed light on the domain requirements of a protein positioned centrally in nuclear RNA metabolism, and they suggest that post-translational modification may modulate its function.

Abstract: Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall that maintains the shape and integrity of the cell. The PG precursor lipid II is assembled at the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, translocated to the periplasmic side, and polymerized to glycan chains by membrane anchored PG synthases, such as the class A Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Polymerization of PG releases the diphosphate form of the carrier lipid, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP), which is converted to the monophosphate form by membrane-embedded pyrophosphatases, generating C55-P for a new round of PG precursor synthesis. Here we report that deletion of the C55-PP pyrophosphatase gene pgpB in E. coli increases the susceptibility to cefsulodin, a β-lactam specific for PBP1A, indicating that the cellular function of PBP1B is impaired in the absence of PgpB. Purified PBP1B interacted with PgpB and another C55-PP pyrophosphatase, BacA and both, PgpB and BacA stimulated the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1B. C55-PP was found to be a potent inhibitor of PBP1B. Our data suggest that the stimulation of PBP1B by PgpB is due to the faster removal and processing of C55-PP, and that PBP1B interacts with C55-PP phosphatases during PG synthesis to couple PG polymerization with the recycling of the carrier lipid and prevent product inhibition by C55-PP.

Abstract: Summary
During sexual intercourse, HIV-1 crosses epithelial barriers composing the genital mucosa, a poorly understood feature that requires an HIV-1-infected cell vectoring efficient mucosal HIV-1 entry. Therefore, urethral mucosa comprising a polarized epithelium and a stroma composed of fibroblasts and macrophages were reconstructed in vitro. Using this system, we demonstrate by live imaging that efficient HIV-1 transmission to stromal macrophages depends on cell-mediated transfer of the virus through virological synapses formed between HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and the epithelial cell mucosal surface. We visualized HIV-1 translocation through mucosal epithelial cells via transcytosis in regions where virological synapses occurred. In turn, interleukin-13 is secreted and HIV-1 targets macrophages, which develop a latent state of infection reversed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. The live observation of virological synapse formation reported herein is key in the design of vaccines and antiretroviral therapies aimed at blocking HIV-1 access to cellular reservoirs in genital mucosa.

Abstract: Summary
Bleach (HOCl) is a powerful oxidant that kills bacteria in part by causing protein aggregation. It inactivates ATP-dependent chaperones, rendering cellular proteins mostly dependent on holdases. Here we identified Escherichia coli CnoX (YbbN) as a folding factor that, when activated by bleach via chlorination, functions as an efficient holdase, protecting the substrates of the major folding systems GroEL/ES and DnaK/J/GrpE. Remarkably, CnoX uniquely combines this function with the ability to prevent the irreversible oxidation of its substrates. This dual activity makes CnoX the founding member of a family of proteins, the “chaperedoxins.” Because CnoX displays a thioredoxin fold and a tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain, two structural motifs conserved in all organisms, this investigation sets the stage for the discovery of additional chaperedoxins in bacteria and eukaryotes that could cooperate with proteins from both the Hsp60 and Hsp70 families.

Abstract: Summary
TIA1 and TIAL1 encode a family of U-rich element mRNA-binding proteins ubiquitously expressed and conserved in metazoans. Using PAR-CLIP, we determined that both proteins bind target sites with identical specificity in 3′ UTRs and introns proximal to 5′ as well as 3′ splice sites. Double knockout (DKO) of TIA1 and TIAL1 increased target mRNA abundance proportional to the number of binding sites and also caused accumulation of aberrantly spliced mRNAs, most of which are subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Loss of PRKRA by mis-splicing triggered the activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase EIF2AK2/PKR and stress granule formation. Ectopic expression of PRKRA cDNA or knockout of EIF2AK2 in DKO cells rescued this phenotype. Perturbation of maturation and/or stability of additional targets further compromised cell cycle progression. Our study reveals the essential contributions of the TIA1 protein family to the fidelity of mRNA maturation, translation, and RNA-stress-sensing pathways in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Xenopus left-right organizer (LRO) breaks symmetry along the left-right axis of the early embryo by producing and sensing directed ciliary flow as a patterning cue. To carry out this process, the LRO contains different ciliated cell types that vary in cilia length, whether they are motile or sensory, and how they position their cilia along the anterior-posterior (A-P) planar axis. Here, we show that these different cilia features are specified in the prospective LRO during gastrulation, based on anisotropic mechanical strain that is oriented along the A-P axis, and graded in levels along the medial-lateral axis. Strain instructs ciliated cell differentiation by acting on a mesodermal prepattern present at blastula stages, involving foxj1. We propose that differential strain is a graded, developmental cue, linking the establishment of an A-P planar axis to cilia length, motility, and planar location during formation of the Xenopus LRO.

Abstract: Summary
Though genetic data suggest that Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) are central chromatin modifiers and repressors that have been implicated in control of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, the precise mechanism of PcG complex recruitment remains elusive, especially in mammals. We now report that the first and second MBT repeats of L3mbtl2 are important structural and functional features that are necessary and sufficient for L3mbtl2-mediated recruitment of PRC1.6 complex to target promoters. Interestingly, this region of L3mbtl2 harbors the evolutionarily conserved Pho-binding pocket also present in Drosophila Sfmbt, and mutation of the critical residues within this pocket completely abolishes its interaction with target promoters. Additionally, decreased PRC1.6 chromatin occupancy was observed following loss of individual components (L3mbtl2, Pcgf6, and Max) of the complex. Our findings suggest that the recruitment of noncanonical PRC1.6 complex in ESCs might be the result of L3mbtl2’s interaction with multiple components of the complex.

Abstract: Summary
Newborn neurons undergo inside-out migration to their final destinations during neocortical development. Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of disabled 1 (Dab1) is a critical mechanism controlling cortical neuron migration. However, the roles of Reelin-independent phosphorylation of Dab1 remain unclear. Here, we report that deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) interacts with Dab1 via its P3 domain. Netrin 1, a DCC ligand, induces Dab1 phosphorylation at Y220 and Y232. Interestingly, knockdown of DCC or truncation of its P3 domain dramatically delays neuronal migration and impairs the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons. Notably, the migration delay and morphological transition defects are rescued by the expression of a phospho-mimetic Dab1 or a constitutively active form of Fyn proto-oncogene (Fyn), a member of the Src-family tyrosine kinases that effectively induces Dab1 phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings illustrate a DCC-Dab1 interaction that ensures proper neuronal migration during neocortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive cancer invariably associated with a chromosomal translocation involving genes encoding the SWI-SNF complex component SS18 and an SSX (SSX1 or SSX2) transcriptional repressor. Using functional genomics, we identify KDM2B, a histone demethylase and component of a non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1), as selectively required for sustaining synovial sarcoma cell transformation. SS18-SSX1 physically interacts with PRC1.1 and co-associates with SWI/SNF and KDM2B complexes on unmethylated CpG islands. Via KDM2B, SS18-SSX1 binds and aberrantly activates expression of developmentally regulated genes otherwise targets of polycomb-mediated repression, which is restored upon KDM2B depletion, leading to irreversible mesenchymal differentiation. Thus, SS18-SSX1 deregulates developmental programs to drive transformation by hijacking a transcriptional repressive complex to aberrantly activate gene expression.

Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, estrogen-related receptor (ERR) regulation of the physiological and biochemical status of testicular tumor Leydig cells. In a mouse tumor Leydig cells, ERRs (α, β, and γ) were silenced via siRNA. Cell morphology and cell physiology (proliferation and observation of monolayer formation) were performed by inverted phase-contrast microscope. Leydig cell functional markers (steroid receptors and signaling molecules) were examined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Additionally, progesterone secretion was assessed. Mitochondrial mass and membrane potential were analyzed by flow-cytometry while cGMP and Ca2+ concentrations were analyzed using immunoenzymatic and colorimetric assays, respectively. These results revealed, ERRs indirectly regulate Leydig cell proliferation while ERRα and β affect cell monolayer formation. ERRs interact with canonical and membrane estrogen receptors (ERα, ERβ, and GPER), androgen receptor, metalloproteinase (MMP 9), protein kinase A (PKA), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 (Notch2). Depending on the type of ERR knocked down, coupled with estradiol treatment, changes in progesterone concentration and cGMP and Ca2+ concentrations constitute a microenvironment that may effect tumor Leydig cell characteristics. ERRs should be considered important factors in developing of innovating approaches that target pathological processes of testicular Leydig cells.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplet (LD) functions are regulated by a complement of integral and peripheral proteins that associate with the bounding LD phospholipid monolayer. Defining the composition of the LD proteome has remained a challenge due to the presence of contaminating proteins in LD-enriched buoyant fractions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a proximity labeling strategy that exploits LD-targeted APEX2 to biotinylate LD proteins in living cells. Application of this approach to two different cell types identified the vast majority of previously validated LD proteins, excluded common contaminating proteins, and revealed new LD proteins. Moreover, quantitative analysis of LD proteome dynamics uncovered a role for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in controlling the composition of the LD proteome. These data provide an important resource for future LD studies and demonstrate the utility of proximity labeling to study the regulation of LD proteomes.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying genetic and environmental factors that impact complex traits and common diseases is a high biomedical priority. Here, we developed, validated, and implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.

Abstract: Summary
Aging brains undergo cognitive decline, associated with decreased neuronal synapse number and function and altered metabolism. Astrocytes regulate neuronal synapse formation and function in development and adulthood, but whether these properties change during aging, contributing to neuronal dysfunction, is unknown. We addressed this by generating aged and adult astrocyte transcriptomes from multiple mouse brain regions. These data provide a comprehensive RNA-seq database of adult and aged astrocyte gene expression, available online as a resource. We identify astrocyte genes altered by aging across brain regions and regionally unique aging changes. Aging astrocytes show minimal alteration of homeostatic and neurotransmission-regulating genes. However, aging astrocytes upregulate genes that eliminate synapses and partially resemble reactive astrocytes. We further identified heterogeneous expression of synapse-regulating genes between astrocytes from different cortical regions. We find that alterations to astrocytes in aging create an environment permissive to synapse elimination and neuronal damage, potentially contributing to aging-associated cognitive decline.

Abstract: Summary
The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) consists of core subunits SUZ12, EED, RBBP4/7, and EZH1/2 and is responsible for mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3. Whereas two distinct forms exist, PRC2.1 (containing one polycomb-like protein) and PRC2.2 (containing AEBP2 and JARID2), little is known about their differential functions. Here, we report the discovery of a family of vertebrate-specific PRC2.1 proteins, “PRC2 associated LCOR isoform 1” (PALI1) and PALI2, encoded by the LCOR and LCORL gene loci, respectively. PALI1 promotes PRC2 methyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo and is essential for mouse development. Pali1 and Aebp2 define mutually exclusive, antagonistic PRC2 subtypes that exhibit divergent H3K27-tri-methylation activities. The balance of these PRC2.1/PRC2.2 activities is required for the appropriate regulation of polycomb target genes during differentiation. PALI1/2 potentially link polycombs with transcriptional co-repressors in the regulation of cellular identity during development and in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cas9 nucleases naturally utilize CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to silence foreign double-stranded DNA. While recent work has shown that some Cas9 nucleases can also target RNA, RNA recognition has required nuclease modifications or accessory factors. Here, we show that the Campylobacter jejuni Cas9 (CjCas9) can bind and cleave complementary endogenous mRNAs in a crRNA-dependent manner. Approximately 100 transcripts co-immunoprecipitated with CjCas9 and generally can be subdivided through their base-pairing potential to the four crRNAs. A subset of these RNAs was cleaved around or within the predicted binding site. Mutational analyses revealed that RNA binding was crRNA and tracrRNA dependent and that target RNA cleavage required the CjCas9 HNH domain. We further observed that RNA cleavage was PAM independent, improved with greater complementarity between the crRNA and the RNA target, and was programmable in vitro. These findings suggest that C. jejuni Cas9 is a promiscuous nuclease that can coordinately target both DNA and RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription activation domains (ADs) are inherently disordered proteins that often target multiple coactivator complexes, but the specificity of these interactions is not understood. Efficient transcription activation by yeast Gcn4 requires its tandem ADs and four activator-binding domains (ABDs) on its target, the Mediator subunit Med15. Multiple ABDs are a common feature of coactivator complexes. We find that the large Gcn4-Med15 complex is heterogeneous and contains nearly all possible AD-ABD interactions. Gcn4-Med15 forms via a dynamic fuzzy protein-protein interface, where ADs bind the ABDs in multiple orientations via hydrophobic regions that gain helicity. This combinatorial mechanism allows individual low-affinity and specificity interactions to generate a biologically functional, specific, and higher affinity complex despite lacking a defined protein-protein interface. This binding strategy is likely representative of many activators that target multiple coactivators, as it allows great flexibility in combinations of activators that can cooperate to regulate genes with variable coactivator requirements.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome biogenesis is a highly regulated, essential cellular process. Although studies in yeast have established some of the biological principles of ribosome biogenesis, many of the intricacies of its regulation in higher eukaryotes remain unknown. To understand how ribosome biogenesis is globally integrated in human cells, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen for regulators of nucleolar number. We found 139 proteins whose depletion changed the number of nucleoli per nucleus from 2–3 to only 1 in human MCF10A cells. Follow-up analyses on 20 hits found many (90%) to be essential for the nucleolar functions of rDNA transcription (7), pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing (16), and/or global protein synthesis (14). This genome-wide analysis exploits the relationship between nucleolar number and function to discover diverse cellular pathways that regulate the making of ribosomes and paves the way for further exploration of the links between ribosome biogenesis and human disease.

Abstract: We describe the construction of a simplified, inexpensive lattice light-sheet microscope, and illustrate its use for imaging subcellular Ca2+ puffs evoked by photoreleased i-IP3 in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells loaded with the Ca2+ probe Cal520. The microscope provides sub-micron spatial resolution and enables recording of local Ca2+ transients in single-slice mode with a signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution (2ms) at least as good as confocal or total internal reflection microscopy. Signals arising from openings of individual IP3R channels are clearly resolved, as are stepwise changes in fluorescence reflecting openings and closings of individual channels during puffs. Moreover, by stepping the specimen through the light-sheet, the entire volume of a cell can be scanned within a few hundred ms. The ability to directly visualize a sideways (axial) section through cells directly reveals that IP3-evoked Ca2+ puffs originate at sites in very close (≤a few hundred nm) to the plasma membrane, suggesting they play a specific role in signaling to the membrane.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenic potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis largely depends on ESX secretion systems exporting members of the multigenic Esx, Esp, and PE/PPE protein families. To study the secretion and regulation patterns of these proteins while circumventing immune cross-reactions due to their extensive sequence homologies, we developed an approach that relies on the recognition of their MHC class II epitopes by highly discriminative T cell receptors (TCRs) of a panel of T cell hybridomas. The latter were engineered so that each expresses a unique fluorescent reporter linked to specific antigen recognition. The resulting polychromatic and multiplexed imaging assay enabled us to measure the secretion of mycobacterial effectors inside infected host cells. We applied this novel technology to a large panel of mutants, clinical isolates, and host-cell types to explore the host-mycobacteria interplay and its impact on the intracellular bacterial secretome, which also revealed the unexpected capacity of phagocytes from lung granuloma to present mycobacterial antigens via MHC class II.

Abstract: Summary
Establishment of precise neuronal connectivity in the neocortex relies on activity-dependent circuit reorganization during postnatal development; however, the nature of cortical activity during this period remains largely unknown. Using two-photon calcium imaging of the barrel cortex in vivo during the first postnatal week, we reveal that layer 4 (L4) neurons within the same barrel fire synchronously in the absence of peripheral stimulation, creating a “patchwork” pattern of spontaneous activity corresponding to the barrel map. By generating transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s in thalamocortical axons, we show that thalamocortical axons also demonstrate the spontaneous patchwork activity pattern. Patchwork activity is diminished by peripheral anesthesia but is mostly independent of self-generated whisker movements. The patchwork activity pattern largely disappeared during postnatal week 2, as even L4 neurons within the same barrel tended to fire asynchronously. This spontaneous L4 activity pattern has features suitable for thalamocortical (TC) circuit refinement in the neonatal barrel cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a leading cause of congenital birth defects, forms an unusual cytoplasmic virion maturation site termed the “assembly compartment” (AC). Here, we show that the AC also acts as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) wherein centrosome activity is suppressed and Golgi-based microtubule (MT) nucleation is enhanced. This involved viral manipulation of discrete functions of MT plus-end-binding (EB) proteins. In particular, EB3, but not EB1 or EB2, was recruited to the AC and was required to nucleate MTs that were rapidly acetylated. EB3-regulated acetylated MTs were necessary for nuclear rotation prior to cell migration, maintenance of AC structure, and optimal virus replication. Independently, a myristoylated peptide that blocked EB3-mediated enrichment of MT regulatory proteins at Golgi regions of the AC also suppressed acetylated MT formation, nuclear rotation, and infection. Thus, HCMV offers new insights into the regulation and functions of Golgi-derived MTs and the therapeutic potential of targeting EB3.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) display an abbreviated cell cycle, resulting in a short doubling time and rapid proliferation. The histone variant H2A.X is critical for proliferation of stem cells, although mechanistic insights have remained obscure. Here, we show that H2A.X defines the rate of mouse ESC proliferation independently of the DNA damage response pathway, and it associates with three major chromatin-modifying complexes. Our functional and biochemical analyses demonstrate that H2A.X-associated factors mediate the H2A.X-dependent effect on ESC proliferation and involve the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC). A specific H2A.X deposition at rDNA promoters determines the chromatin recruitment of the NoRC, histone modifications, the rRNA transcription, and the rate of proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that NoRC assembly by H2A.X deposition at rRNA promoters silences transcription, and this represents an important regulatory component for ESC proliferation.

Abstract: Background
We havebeen attempting to use cardiac spheroids to construct three-dimensional contractilestructures for failed hearts. Recent studies have reported that neuralprogenitors (NPs) play significant roles in heart regeneration. However, theeffect of NPs on the cardiac spheroid has not yet been elucidated.
Objective
This studyaims to demonstrate the influence of NPs on the function of cardiac spheroids.
Methods
Thespheroids were constructed on a low-attachment-well plate by mixing humaninduced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes and hiPScell-derived NPs (hiPS-NPs). The ratio of hiPS-NPs was set at 0%, 10%, 20%,30%, and 40% of the total cell number of spheroids, which was 2500. The motionwas recorded, and the fractional shortening and the contraction velocity weremeasured.
Results
Spheroidswere formed within 48 h after mixing the cells, except for the spheroidscontaining 0% hiPS-NPs. Observation at day 7 revealed significant differencesin the fractional shortening (analysis of variance; p = 0.01). The bestfractional shortening was observed with the spheroids containing 30% hiPS-NPs.Neuronal cells were detected morphologically within the spheroids under aconfocal microscope.
Conclusion
Theaddition of hiPS-NPs influenced the contractile function of the cardiacspheroids. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The functional impact of the vast majority of cancer somatic mutations remains unknown, representing a critical knowledge gap for implementing precision oncology. Here, we report the development of a moderate-throughput functional genomic platform consisting of efficient mutant generation, sensitive viability assays using two growth factor-dependent cell models, and functional proteomic profiling of signaling effects for select aberrations. We apply the platform to annotate >1,000 genomic aberrations, including gene amplifications, point mutations, indels, and gene fusions, potentially doubling the number of driver mutations characterized in clinically actionable genes. Further, the platform is sufficiently sensitive to identify weak drivers. Our data are accessible through a user-friendly, public data portal. Our study will facilitate biomarker discovery, prediction algorithm improvement, and drug development.

Abstract: The somatic cells having higher levels of DNA methylation and reducing it in donor cells before nuclear transfer (NT) by treating them with chemicals, may improve cloning efficiency of NT embryos by providing donor cells with similar epigenetic characteristics as in vivo embryos. Therefore, the present study was planned to understand mechanism of epigenetic changes in donor cells (buffalo fibroblasts) treated with different concentration of sodium butyrate (NaBu)-a chromatin remodeling agent. The cultured fibroblasts purity and lineage were confirmed by fibroblast specific protein and gene markers (Vimentin, Tubulin and Cytokeratin) at different passages using immuno-staining and qPCR respectively. The buffalo fibroblast cells were treated with 1, 3 and 5 mM of NaBu and observations were taken on their morphological changes, population doubling time and cell proliferation after 48 h of treatment. The epigenetic changes were observed using acetylation (H3K9ac) and methylation (H3K27me3) markers expression. The fibroblast cells derived from new born ear tissue started emerging and anchoring to cell culture flasks within 24 h and showed spindle-shaped morphology. The confluent culture was cryopreserved at different time interval. The post thaw culture behavior of the cryopreserved cells was also observed at different time interval and passages. The morphology of NaBu treated cells were changed with increase of dosages of NaBu treatment. The increase population doubling times and decreases the proliferation rate in the dose dependent manner. The NaBu treatment showed that the significantly increased the acetylation (H3K9ac) and methylation (H3K27me3) level over the control. Based on the observations of fibroblast characterization as well as epigenetic modifications of these cells after treatment with NaBu, results suggest that the cells may provide a useful approach for better epigenetic reprogramming in SCNT embryos.

Abstract: Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are a unique component of plant cell walls, undergoing extensive posttranslational modification such as proline hydroxylation and hydroxyproline-O-glycosylation. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) and extensins are major members of the HRGP superfamily. AGPs have repetitive AlaHyp, SerHyp, and ThrHyp peptides, the Hyp residues being glycosylated with large type II arabinogalactan polysaccharides, while extensins contain characteristic SerHyp4 and SerHyp2 motifs with arabinosylated (1–4 residues) Hyp. Although they are less than ten percent in all wall materials, AGPs and extensins play important roles in all aspects of plant growth and development. The detailed mechanisms of their functions are still under investigation. However, many of the functions may be attributed to their adhesive properties. Here, we used a forced unbinding technique to measure relative adhesive potential of the well characterized (AlaHyp)51 and (SerHyp4)18 glycomodules representing AGPs and extensins, respectively. In the presence of different wall ions such as protons, Ca2+, and boron, the glycomodules exhibited different adhesive patterns, suggesting that the wall ion-regulated intermolecular interactions/adhesions between AGPs and/or extensins may be involved in maintaining wall-plasma membrane integrity during wall loosening processes such as wall elongation or expansion. This research applies a biophysical approach to understand the biological function of plant cell wall glycoproteins.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic chromosome movement is important for the pairwise alignment of homologous chromosomes, which is required for correct chromosome segregation. Movement is driven by cytoplasmic forces, transmitted to chromosome ends by nuclear membrane-spanning proteins. In animal cells, lamins form a prominent scaffold at the nuclear periphery, yet the role lamins play in meiotic chromosome movement is unclear. We show that chromosome movement correlates with reduced lamin association with the nuclear rim, which requires lamin phosphorylation at sites analogous to those that open lamina network crosslinks in mitosis. Failure to remodel the lamina results in delayed meiotic entry, altered chromatin organization, unpaired or interlocked chromosomes, and slowed chromosome movement. The remodeling kinases are delivered to lamins via chromosome ends coupled to the nuclear envelope, potentially enabling crosstalk between the lamina and chromosomal events. Thus, opening the lamina network plays a role in modulating contacts between chromosomes and the nuclear periphery during meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems utilize a single RNA-guided protein effector to mitigate viral infection. We aggregated genomic data from multiple sources and constructed an expanded database of predicted class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. A search for novel RNA-targeting systems identified subtype VI-D, encoding dual HEPN domain-containing Cas13d effectors and putative WYL-domain-containing accessory proteins (WYL1 and WYL-b1 through WYL-b5). The median size of Cas13d proteins is 190 to 300 aa smaller than that of Cas13a–Cas13c. Despite their small size, Cas13d orthologs from Eubacterium siraeum (Es) and Ruminococcus sp. (Rsp) are active in both CRISPR RNA processing and targeting, as well as collateral RNA cleavage, with no target-flanking sequence requirements. The RspWYL1 protein stimulates RNA cleavage by both EsCas13d and RspCas13d, demonstrating a common regulatory mechanism for divergent Cas13d orthologs. The small size, minimal targeting constraints, and modular regulation of Cas13d effectors further expands the CRISPR toolkit for RNA manipulation and detection.

Abstract: Summary
Furin trafficking, and that of related proprotein convertases (PCs), may regulate which substrates are accessible for endoproteolysis, but tools to directly test this hypothesis have been lacking. Here, we develop targeted biosensors that indicate Furin activity in endosomes is 10-fold less inhibited by decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone and enriched >3-fold in endosomes compared to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Endogenous PC7, which resists this inhibitor, was active in distinct vesicles. Only overexpressed PC7 activity reached the cell surface, endosomes, and the TGN. A PLC motif in the cytosolic tail of PC7 was dispensable for endosomal activity, but it was specifically required for TGN recycling and to rescue proActivin-A cleavage in Furin-depleted B16F1 melanoma cells. In sharp contrast, PC7 complemented Furin in cleaving Notch1 independently of PLC-mediated TGN access. Our study provides a proof in principle that compartment-specific biosensors can be used to gain insight into the regulation of PC trafficking and to map the tropism of PC-specific inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampal formation is a brain structure essential for higher-order cognitive functions. It has a complex anatomical organization and cellular composition, and hippocampal subregions have different properties and functional roles. In this study, we used SWATH-MS to determine whether the proteomes of hippocampus areas CA1 and CA3 can explain the commonalities or specificities of these subregions in basal conditions and after recognition memory. We show that the proteomes of areas CA1 and CA3 are largely different in basal conditions and that differential changes and dynamics in protein expression are induced in these areas after recognition of an object or object location. While changes are consistent across both recognition paradigms in area CA1, they are not in area CA3, suggesting distinct proteomic responses in areas CA1 and CA3 for memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
AXL is activated by its ligand GAS6 and is expressed in triple-negative breast cancer cells. In the current study, we report AXL expression in HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancers where it correlates with poor patient survival. Using murine models of HER2+ breast cancer, Axl, but not its ligand Gas6, was found to be essential for metastasis. We determined that AXL is required for intravasation, extravasation, and growth at the metastatic site. We found that AXL is expressed in HER2+ cancers displaying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures where it contributes to sustain EMT. Interfering with AXL in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced cell invasion. Last, pharmacological inhibition of AXL specifically decreased the metastatic burden of mice developing HER2+ breast cancer. Our data identify AXL as a potential anti-metastatic co-therapeutic target for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a pre-malignant condition of the gastric mucosa associated with increased gastric cancer (GC) risk. We performed (epi)genomic profiling of 138 IMs from 148 cancer-free patients, recruited through a 10-year prospective study. Compared with GCs, IMs exhibit low mutational burdens, recurrent mutations in certain tumor suppressors (FBXW7) but not others (TP53, ARID1A), chromosome 8q amplification, and shortened telomeres. Sequencing identified more IM patients with active Helicobacter pylori infection compared with histopathology (11%–27%). Several IMs exhibited hypermethylation at DNA methylation valleys; however, IMs generally lack intragenic hypomethylation signatures of advanced malignancy. IM patients with shortened telomeres and chromosomal alterations were associated with subsequent dysplasia or GC; conversely patients exhibiting normal-like epigenomic patterns were associated with regression.

Abstract: Summary
Islet β cells from newborn mammals exhibit high basal insulin secretion and poor glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here we show that β cells of newborns secrete more insulin than adults in response to similar intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, suggesting differences in the Ca2+ sensitivity of insulin secretion. Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4), a non-Ca2+ binding paralog of the β cell Ca2+ sensor Syt7, increased by ∼8-fold during β cell maturation. Syt4 ablation increased basal insulin secretion and compromised GSIS. Precocious Syt4 expression repressed basal insulin secretion but also impaired islet morphogenesis and GSIS. Syt4 was localized on insulin granules and Syt4 levels inversely related to the number of readily releasable vesicles. Thus, transcriptional regulation of Syt4 affects insulin secretion; Syt4 expression is regulated in part by Myt transcription factors, which repress Syt4 transcription. Finally, human SYT4 regulated GSIS in EndoC-βH1 cells, a human β cell line. These findings reveal the role that altered Ca2+ sensing plays in regulating β cell maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression levels in clonal bacterial groups have been found to be spatially correlated. These correlations can partly be explained by the shared lineage history of nearby cells, although they could also arise from local cell-cell interactions. Here, we present a quantitative framework that allows us to disentangle the contributions of lineage history, long-range spatial gradients, and local cell-cell interactions to spatial correlations in gene expression. We study pathways involved in toxin production, SOS stress response, and metabolism in Escherichia coli microcolonies and find for all pathways that shared lineage history is the main cause of spatial correlations in gene expression levels. However, long-range spatial gradients and local cell-cell interactions also contributed to spatial correlations in SOS response, amino acid biosynthesis, and overall metabolic activity. Together, our data show that the phenotype of a cell is influenced by its lineage history and population context, raising the question of whether bacteria can arrange their activities in space to perform functions they cannot achieve alone.

Abstract: Summary
A key feature of Notch signaling is that it directs immediate changes in transcription via the DNA-binding factor CSL, switching it from repression to activation. How Notch generates both a sensitive and accurate response—in the absence of any amplification step—remains to be elucidated. To address this question, we developed real-time analysis of CSL dynamics including single-molecule tracking in vivo. In Notch-OFF nuclei, a small proportion of CSL molecules transiently binds DNA, while in Notch-ON conditions CSL recruitment increases dramatically at target loci, where complexes have longer dwell times conferred by the Notch co-activator Mastermind. Surprisingly, recruitment of CSL-related corepressors also increases in Notch-ON conditions, revealing that Notch induces cooperative or “assisted” loading by promoting local increase in chromatin accessibility. Thus, in vivo Notch activity triggers changes in CSL dwell times and chromatin accessibility, which we propose confer sensitivity to small input changes and facilitate timely shut-down.

Abstract: Summary
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations cause Wnt pathway activation in human cancers. Current models for APC action emphasize its role in promoting β-catenin degradation downstream of Wnt receptors. Unexpectedly, we find that blocking Wnt receptor activity in APC-deficient cells inhibits Wnt signaling independently of Wnt ligand. We also show that inducible loss of APC is rapidly followed by Wnt receptor activation and increased β-catenin levels. In contrast, APC2 loss does not promote receptor activation. We show that APC exists in a complex with clathrin and that Wnt pathway activation in APC-deficient cells requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate conservation of this mechanism in Drosophila intestinal stem cells. We propose a model in which APC and APC2 function to promote β-catenin degradation, and APC also acts as a molecular “gatekeeper” to block receptor activation via the clathrin pathway.

Abstract: This study evaluated ulceroprotective and antioxidant effect of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 against gastric damage in rats. Rats were treated intraperitoneally with either 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (0.25 μg/kg) or saline for 14 days. On day-15, the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg; subcutaneously), the inhibitor of sulfhydryl groups N-ethylmaleimide (10 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) or ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker glibenclamide (10 mg/kg; orally) was given prior to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. Animals were euthanized at 60 min post ulcerogenic challenge (0.3 M HCl and 60% ethanol (0.2 mL; orally). Stomach and blood were collected for biochemical and histological evaluations. HCl/Ethanol group revealed severely damaged mucous and glandular epithelium with diffuse hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration (microscopic score: 10.67 ± 0.67 and ulcer index: 33.13 ± 5.09). 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 decreased the extent of damage (microscopic score: 6.80 ± 0.02 and ulcer index: 19.00 ± 4.34; p < 0.05), and the elevations in gastric malondialdehyde level (p < 0.001), myeloperoxidase activity (p < 0.001), nuclear factor-κB expression (p < 0.05), and apoptotic index (p < 0.05) following HCl/Ethanol challenge. Decreased gastric glutathione following HCl/Ethanol administration was restored by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (p < 0.01). These findings demonstrated protection of the gastric mucosa against HCl/Ethanol-induced injury by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 via attenuation of inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Accessory proteins of lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, target cellular restriction factors to enhance viral replication. Systematic analyses of proteins that are targeted for degradation by HIV-1 accessory proteins may provide a better understanding of viral immune evasion strategies. Here, we describe a high-throughput platform developed to study cellular protein stability in a highly parallelized matrix format. We used this approach to identify cellular targets of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu through arrayed coexpression with 433 interferon-stimulated genes, followed by differential fluorescent labeling and automated image analysis. Among the previously unreported Vpu targets identified by this approach, we find that the E2 ligase mediating ISG15 conjugation, UBE2L6, and the transmembrane protein PLP2 are targeted by Vpu during HIV-1 infection to facilitate late-stage replication. This study provides a framework for the systematic and high-throughput evaluation of protein stability and establishes a more comprehensive portrait of cellular Vpu targets.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which the mammalian airway detects invading viral pathogens to trigger protective innate neutrophilic inflammation are incompletely understood. We observe that innate activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/RelA transcription factor indirectly activates atypical BRD4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation, and secretion of neutrophilic chemokines. To study this pathway in vivo, we developed a conditional knockout of RelA in distal airway epithelial cells; these animals have reduced mucosal BRD4/Pol II activation and neutrophilic inflammation to viral patterns. To further understand the role of BRD4 in vivo, two potent, highly selective small-molecule BRD4 inhibitors were developed. These well-tolerated inhibitors disrupt the BRD4 complex with Pol II and histones, completely blocking inducible epithelial chemokine production and neutrophilia. We conclude that RelA-BRD4 signaling in distal tracheobronchiolar epithelial cells mediates acute inflammation in response to luminal viral patterns. These potent BRD4 antagonists are versatile pharmacological tools for investigating BRD4 functions in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary hypertension is a devastating disease characterized by excessive vascular muscularization. We previously demonstrated primed platelet-derived growth factor receptor β+ (PDGFR-β+)/smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker+ progenitors at the muscular-unmuscular arteriole border in the normal lung, and in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, a single primed cell migrates distally and expands clonally, giving rise to most of the pathological smooth muscle coating of small arterioles. Little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Herein, we show that primed cell expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) are required, respectively, for distal migration and smooth muscle expansion in a sequential manner. In addition, the HIF1-α/PDGF-B axis in endothelial cells non-cell autonomously regulates primed cell induction, proliferation, and differentiation. Finally, myeloid cells transdifferentiate into or fuse with distal arteriole SMCs during hypoxia, and Pdgfb deletion in myeloid cells attenuates pathological muscularization. Thus, primed cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous pathways are attractive therapeutic targets for pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: Summary
Heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) are essential transducers in G protein signaling systems in all eukaryotes. In yeast, G protein signaling differentially activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)—Fus3 and Kss1—a phenomenon controlled by plasma membrane (PM) association of the scaffold protein Ste5. Here, we show that phosphorylation of the yeast Gγ subunit (Ste18), together with Fus3 docking on Ste5, controls the rate and stability of Ste5/PM association. Disruption of either element alone by point mutation has mild but reciprocal effects on MAPK activation. Disabling both elements results in ultra-fast and stable bulk Ste5/PM localization and Fus3 activation that is 6 times faster and 4 times more amplified compared to wild-type cells. These results further resolve the mechanism by which MAPK negative feedback phosphorylation controls pathway activation and provides compelling evidence that Gγ subunits can serve as intrinsic regulators of G protein signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Multisensory integration (MSI) is a fundamental emergent property of the mammalian brain. During MSI, perceptual information encoded in patterned activity is processed in multimodal association cortex. The systems-level neuronal dynamics that coordinate MSI, however, are unknown. Here, we demonstrate intrinsic hub-like network activity in the association cortex that regulates MSI. We engineered calcium reporter mouse lines based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor yellow cameleon (YC2.60) expressed in excitatory or inhibitory neurons. In medial and parietal association cortex, we observed spontaneous slow waves that self-organized into hubs defined by long-range excitatory and local inhibitory circuits. Unlike directional source/sink-like flows in sensory areas, medial/parietal excitatory and inhibitory hubs had net-zero balanced inputs. Remarkably, multisensory stimulation triggered rapid phase-locking mainly of excitatory hub activity persisting for seconds after the stimulus offset. Therefore, association cortex tends to form balanced excitatory networks that configure slow-wave phase-locking for MSI.

Abstract: Summary
While genes are defined by sequence, in biological systems a protein's function is largely determined by its three-dimensional structure. Evolutionary information embedded within multiple sequence alignments provides a rich source of data for inferring structural constraints on macromolecules. Still, many proteins of interest lack sufficient numbers of related sequences, leading to noisy, error-prone residue-residue contact predictions. Here we introduce DeepContact, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that discovers co-evolutionary motifs and leverages these patterns to enable accurate inference of contact probabilities, particularly when few related sequences are available. DeepContact significantly improves performance over previous methods, including in the CASP12 blind contact prediction task where we achieved top performance with another CNN-based approach. Moreover, our tool converts hard-to-interpret coupling scores into probabilities, moving the field toward a consistent metric to assess contact prediction across diverse proteins. Through substantially improving the precision-recall behavior of contact prediction, DeepContact suggests we are near a paradigm shift in template-free modeling for protein structure prediction.

Abstract: Summary
To uncover regulatory mechanisms in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, we conducted genome-wide screens to identify positive and negative pathway components and validated top hits using multiple signaling and differentiation assays in two different cell types. Most positive regulators identified in our screens, including Rab34, Pdcl, and Tubd1, were involved in ciliary functions, confirming the central role for primary cilia in Hh signaling. Negative regulators identified included Megf8, Mgrn1, and an unannotated gene encoding a tetraspan protein we named Atthog. The function of these negative regulators converged on Smoothened (SMO), an oncoprotein that transduces the Hh signal across the membrane. In the absence of Atthog, SMO was stabilized at the cell surface and concentrated in the ciliary membrane, boosting cell sensitivity to the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and consequently altering SHH-guided neural cell-fate decisions. Thus, we uncovered genes that modify the interpretation of morphogen signals by regulating protein-trafficking events in target cells.

Abstract: Summary
The arginine methylation status of histones dynamically changes during many cellular processes, including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development. The arginine methyltransferases and the readers that transduce the histone codes have been defined. However, whether arginine demethylation actively occurs in cells and what enzyme demethylates the methylarginine residues during various cellular processes are unknown. We report that JMJD1B, previously identified as a lysine demethylase for H3K9me2, mediates arginine demethylation of H4R3me2s and its intermediate, H4R3me1. We show that demethylation of H4R3me2s and H3K9me2s in promoter regions is correlated with active gene expression. Furthermore, knockout of JMJD1B blocks demethylation of H4R3me2s and/or H3K9me2 at distinct clusters of genes and impairs the activation of genes important for HSPC differentiation and development. Consequently, JMJD1B−/− mice show defects in hematopoiesis. Altogether, our study demonstrates that demethylase-mediated active arginine demethylation process exists in eukaryotes and that JMJD1B demethylates both H4R3me2s and H3K9me2 for epigenetic programming during hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) signaling plays a crucial role in a wide range of eukaryotic processes. In Plasmodium falciparum, IP3 elicits Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, even though no IP3 receptor homolog has been identified to date. The human host hormone melatonin plays a key role in entraining the P. falciparum life cycle in the intraerythrocytic stages, apparently through an IP3-dependent Ca2+ signal. The melatonin-induced cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) increase and malaria cell cycle can be blocked by the IP3 receptor blocker 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB). However, 2-APB also inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Therefore, we have used two novel 2-APB derivatives, DPB162-AE and DPB163-AE, which are 100-fold more potent than 2-APB in blocking SOCE in mammalian cells, and appear to act by interfering with clustering of STIM proteins. In the present work we report that DPB162-AE and DPB163-AE block the [Ca2+]cyt rise in response to melatonin in P. falciparum, but only at high concentrations. These compounds also block SOCE in the parasite at similarly high concentrations suggesting that P. falciparum SOCE is not activated in the same way as in mammalian cells. We further find that DPB162-AE and DPB163-AE affect the development of the intraerythrocytic parasites and invasion of new red blood cells. Our efforts to episomally express proteins that compete with native IP3 receptor like IP3-sponge and an IP3 sensor such as IRIS proved to be lethal to P. falciparum during intraerythrocytic cycle. The present findings point to an important role of IP3-induced Ca2+ release in intraerythrocytic stage of P. falciparum.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic seeding is driven by cell-intrinsic and environmental cues, yet the contribution of biomechanics is poorly known. We aim to elucidate the impact of blood flow on the arrest and the extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in vivo. Using the zebrafish embryo, we show that arrest of CTCs occurs in vessels with favorable flow profiles where flow forces control the adhesion efficacy of CTCs to the endothelium. We biophysically identified the threshold values of flow and adhesion forces allowing successful arrest of CTCs. In addition, flow forces fine-tune tumor cell extravasation by impairing the remodeling properties of the endothelium. Importantly, we also observe endothelial remodeling at arrest sites of CTCs in mouse brain capillaries. Finally, we observed that human supratentorial brain metastases preferably develop in areas with low perfusion. These results demonstrate that hemodynamic profiles at metastatic sites regulate key steps of extravasation preceding metastatic outgrowth.
