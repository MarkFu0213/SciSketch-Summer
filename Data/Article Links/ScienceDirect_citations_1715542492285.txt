Abstract: Continuous activation of angiotensin II (Ang II) induces renal vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which may contribute to renal damage. It is well established that microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of hypertensive renal damage. However, the detailed mechanisms and regulatory roles of miRNAs as therapeutic targets underlying Ang II-induced renal artery endothelial cell dysfunction in hypertensive renal damage have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the expression status and putative role of miRNA-200c-3p in mediating the progression of hypertensive renal damage. We carried out real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect the expression of miRNA-200c-3p in rat renal artery endothelial cells (RRAECs) induced by Ang II. MTT and transwell assays were utilized to evaluate the effects of miRNA-200c-3p on cell proliferation and migration, respectively. The present results revealed that the expression of miRNA-200c-3p was significantly upregulated in RRAECs exposed to Ang II compared with that of normal cells. miRNA-200c-3p overexpression markedly inhibited cell proliferation and migration of Ang II-induced RRAECs. Furthermore, bioinformatics predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was a direct target gene of miRNA-200c-3p and that ZEB2 expression was inversely correlated with the levels of miRNA-200c-3p in RRAECs after exposure to Ang II. The effects of ZEB2 silencing were similar to the inhibitory effects observed following miRNA-200c-3p overexpression, and recovered ZEB2 expression reversed the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory influence of miRNA-200c-3p upregulation in RRAECs induced by Ang II. The present study indicated that miRNA-200c-3p might suppress the proliferation and migration of Ang II-induced RRAECs by targeting ZEB2. The miRNA-200c-3p/ZEB2 axis will provide valuable insights into the clinical management of hypertension-related kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL1, KMT2A) gene is critical for development and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), however, whether this protein is limiting for HSC development is unknown due to lack of physiologic model systems. Here, we develop an MLL1-inducible embryonic stem cell (ESC) system and show that induction of wild-type MLL1 during ESC differentiation selectively increases hematopoietic potential from a transitional c-Kit+/Cd41+ population in the embryoid body and also at sites of hematopoiesis in embryos. Single-cell sequencing analysis illustrates inherent heterogeneity of the c-Kit+/Cd41+ population and demonstrates that MLL1 induction shifts its composition toward multilineage hematopoietic identities. Surprisingly, this does not occur through increasing Hox or other canonical MLL1 targets but through an enhanced Rac/Rho/integrin signaling state, which increases responsiveness to Vla4 ligands and enhances hematopoietic commitment. Together, our data implicate a Rac/Rho/integrin signaling axis in the endothelial to hematopoietic transition and demonstrate that MLL1 actives this axis.

Abstract: Background
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α associates with poor outcome in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma, and gain-of-function mutations in the EPAS1 gene (encoding HIF-2α) have been reported in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. Specific targeting of a druggable hydrophobic pocket in the HIF-2α PAS-B domain with PT2385 have demonstrated promising clinical results for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here, we investigated the effect of PT2385-mediated inhibition of ARNT dependent HIF-2 activity.
Methods
Neuroblastoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells were treated with PT2385 and analyzed for HIF-2-dependent gene expression, HIF activity, HIF-2α protein localization, response to chemotherapy and orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Two-sided student t-test was used.
Results
We detected high levels of HIF-2α protein in perivascular niches in neuroblastoma PDXs in vivo and at oxygenated conditions in PDX-derived cell cultures in vitro, particularly in the cytoplasmic fraction. Nuclear HIF-2α expression was reduced following PT2385 treatment, but surprisingly, virtually no effects on tumor growth in vivo or expression of canonical HIF downstream target genes in vitro were observed. In coherence, RNA sequencing of PT2385-treated PDX cells revealed a virtually unaffected transcriptome. Treatment with PT2385 did not affect cellular response to chemotherapy. In contrast, HIF-2α protein knockdown resulted in profound downregulation of target genes.
Conclusions
The lack of effect from PT2385 treatment in combination with high cytoplasmic HIF-2α expression at normoxia suggest that HIF-2α have additional roles than acting as an ARNT dependent transcription factor. It is important to further unravel the conditions at which HIF-2α has transcriptional and non-transcriptional roles in neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) has various biological activities including the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. However, its role in bone homeostasis and remodeling remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the effects of TIMP1 on osteoblast and osteoclast activity at both cellular and molecular level using siRNA-mediated knockdown technique. Our results show that knockdown of TIMP1 stimulates proliferation and survival, but decreases apoptosis in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting that TIMP1 inhibits cell growth. TIMP1 also dampens differentiation of committed osteoblasts, as well as osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). We further show that the modulation of TIMP1 on osteoblast activity is independent of its MMP inhibition. Importantly, we uncover that TIMP1 suppresses osteoblast growth and differentiation by targeting the AKT pathway, and this is associated with TIMP1-mediated induction of PTEN via its binding to the cell surface receptor CD44. Therefore, our results highlight a novel TIMP1/CD44/PTEN/AKT signaling nexus that functions as a suppressor of osteoblast activity. Moreover, we show that TIMP1 also inhibits osteoclast differentiation in osteoclast precursor RAW 264.7 cells by targeting the AKT. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that TIMP1 can act as a suppressor of growth and differentiation of osteoblasts and differentiation of osteoclasts through the negative regulation of the AKT pathway. We propose that TIMP1 may serve as a potential target for low bone mass-related skeletal diseases, such as osteoporosis.

Melatonin attenuates vascular calcification by activating autophagy via an AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway,

Abstract: Melatonin has been demonstrated to protect against calcification in cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Autophagy may affect vascular calcification by inhibiting apoptosis and the transdifferentiation process. This study sought to explore whether melatonin attenuates vascular calcification by regulating autophagy via the AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/Unc-51-like kinase 1 (AMPK/mTOR/ULK1) signaling pathway. The effects of melatonin on vascular calcification were investigated in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Calcium deposits were visualised by Alizarin red staining, while calcium content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were used to evaluate osteogenic differentiation. Western blots were used to measure expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2, an osteogenic transcription factor), light chain 3 (LC3) II/I, and cleaved caspase 3. Melatonin markedly reduced calcium deposition and ALP activity. Runx2 and cleaved caspase 3 were downregulated, whereas LC3 II/I was increased in response to melatonin, and was accompanied by decreased apoptosis. An immunofluorescence assay revealed that melatonin treatment markedly decreased Runx2 expression and upregulated LC3 expression. Treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine reversed this phenomenon. Melatonin significantly increased expression of p-AMPK and p-ULK1, and decreased mTOR expression. Treatment with compound C (an inhibitor of AMPK) or MHY1485 (an agonist of mTOR) ablated the observed benefits of melatonin treatment. Melatonin protects VSMCs against calcification by activating autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Published Mycobacterium tuberculosis β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase KasA inhibitors lack sufficient potency and/or pharmacokinetic properties. A structure-based approach was used to optimize existing KasA inhibitor DG167. This afforded indazole JSF-3285 with a 30-fold increase in mouse plasma exposure. Biochemical, genetic, and X-ray studies confirmed JSF-3285 targets KasA. JSF-3285 offers substantial activity in an acute mouse model of infection and in the corresponding chronic infection model, with efficacious reductions in colony-forming units at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once daily orally and improvement of the efficacy of front-line drugs isoniazid or rifampicin. JSF-3285 is a promising preclinical candidate for tuberculosis.

Abstract: Summary
Secondary bile acids (SBAs) are derived from primary bile acids (PBAs) in a process reliant on biosynthetic capabilities possessed by few microbes. To evaluate the role of BAs in intestinal inflammation, we performed metabolomic, microbiome, metagenomic, and transcriptomic profiling of stool from ileal pouches (surgically created resevoirs) in colectomy-treated patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) versus controls (familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]). We show that relative to FAP, UC pouches have reduced levels of lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid (normally the most abundant gut SBAs), genes required to convert PBAs to SBAs, and Ruminococcaceae (one of few taxa known to include SBA-producing bacteria). In three murine colitis models, SBA supplementation reduces intestinal inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect is in part dependent on the TGR5 bile acid receptor. These data suggest that dysbiosis induces SBA deficiency in inflammatory-prone UC patients, which promotes a pro-inflammatory state within the intestine that may be treated by SBA restoration.

Abstract: Summary
The neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the olfactory epithelium (OE) regenerate damaged olfactory sensory neurons throughout adulthood. The accessibility and availability of these NSCs in living individuals, including humans, makes them a promising candidate for harvesting their potential for cell replacement therapies. However, this requires an in-depth understanding of their developmental potential after grafting. Here, we investigated the developmental potential and plasticity of mouse OE-derived NSCs after grafting into the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche. Our results showed that OE-derived NSCs integrate and proliferate just like endogenous SVZ stem cells, migrate with similar dynamics as endogenous neuroblasts toward the olfactory bulb, and mature and acquire similar electrophysiological properties as endogenous adult-born bulbar interneurons. These results reveal the developmental potential and plasticity of OE-derived NSCs in vivo and show that they can respond to heterotopic neurogenic cues to adapt their phenotype and become functional neurons in ectopic brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus disease is a severe health problem in Africa. Vaccines that display the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein spike complex are a prime component for the effort to combat it. The VH3-15/Vλ1-40-based class of antibodies was recently discovered to be a common response in individuals who received the Ebola virus vaccines. These antibodies display attractive properties, and thus likely contribute to the efficacy of the vaccines. Here, we use cryo-EM to elucidate how three VH3-15/Vλ1-40 antibodies from different individuals target the virus and found a convergent mechanism against a partially conserved site on the spike complex. Our study rationalizes the selection of the VH3-15/Vλ1-40 germline genes for specifically targeting this site and highlights Ebolavirus species-specific sequence divergences that may restrict breadth of VH3-15/Vλ1-40-based humoral response. The results from this study could help develop improved immunization schemes and further enable the design of immunogens that would be efficacious against a broader set of Ebolavirus species.

Abstract: Summary
Hookworms cause a major neglected tropical disease, occurring after larvae penetrate the host skin. Neutrophils are phagocytes that kill large pathogens by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), but whether they target hookworms during skin infection is unknown. Using a murine hookworm, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, we observed neutrophils being rapidly recruited and deploying NETs around skin-penetrating larvae. Neutrophils depletion or NET inhibition altered larvae behavior and enhanced the number of adult worms following murine infection. Nevertheless, larvae were able to mitigate the effect of NETs by secreting a deoxyribonuclease (Nb-DNase II) to degrade the DNA backbone. Critically, neutrophils were able to kill larvae in vitro, which was enhanced by neutralizing Nb-DNase II. Homologs of Nb-DNase II are present in other nematodes, including the human hookworm, Necator americanus, which also evaded NETs in vitro. These findings highlight the importance of neutrophils in hookworm infection and a potential conserved mechanism of immune evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Legionella pneumophila has co-evolved with amoebae, their natural hosts. Upon transmission to humans, the bacteria proliferate within alveolar macrophages causing pneumonia. Here, we show L. pneumophila injects the effector LamA, an amylase, into the cytosol of human macrophage (hMDMs) and amoebae to rapidly degrade glycogen to generate cytosolic hyper-glucose. In response, hMDMs shift their metabolism to aerobic glycolysis, which directly triggers an M1-like pro-inflammatory differentiation and nutritional innate immunity through enhanced tryptophan degradation. This leads to a modest restriction of bacterial proliferation in hMDMs. In contrast, LamA-mediated glycogenolysis in amoebae deprives the natural host from the main building blocks for synthesis of the cellulose-rich cyst wall, leading to subversion of amoeba encystation. This is non-permissive for bacterial proliferation. Therefore, LamA of L. pneumophila is an amoebae host-adapted effector that subverts encystation of the amoebae natural host, and the paradoxical hMDMs’ pro-inflammatory response is likely an evolutionary accident.

Abstract: LAMC2, as a unique chain in the Laminin 5 molecule, has been found to be associated with malignant metastases in some cancers. However, the roles and mechanisms by which LAMC2 affects the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells remain unclear. First, we found that laminin 5/LAMC2 and its receptors were highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Then, we investigated the effects of LAMC2 on pancreatic cancer cell migration/invasion and extracellular (pHe). We also demonstrated that LAMC2 phosphorylated Akt-Ser473 to promote the expression, activity and cell membrane accumulation of NHE1 within pancreatic cancer cells. So we speculated that LAMC2 modulated the pHe to promote migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, our data also showed that LAMC2/NHE1 resulted in altered cell morphology and aberrant expression of mesenchymal markers. The function of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) were affected by LAMC2/NHE1 signaling. LAMC2/NHE1 signaling generated extracellular acidification to induce dynamic actin-dependent pseudopodial formation and EMT programs that promote tumor cell invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, we found that LAMC2 was responsible for generating the extracellular acidic conditions that mediated invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by activating Akt/NHE1 signaling. LAMC2 is a characteristic prognostic and therapeutic agent of PDCA.

Abstract: Canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is a commonly occurring aggressive tumor stemming from the vascular endothelial cells and is considered to be a good model for a similar disease in humans, called angiosarcoma. In this study, we reviewed drug libraries to identify new signal transduction inhibitors that can suppress the cell growth of canine HSA in vitro. We observed that tenovin-6, a sirtuin (SIRT) inhibitor, inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in three canine HSA cell lines (JuB4, Re12, and Ud6). These effects were induced through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-3 activation. Although tenovin-6 is known as an inhibitor of SIRT1 and SIRT2, knockout (KO) of genes encoding SIRT1 and/or SIRT2 had no apparent impact on cell proliferation in canine HSA. In addition, tenovin-6 showed cell growth inhibition in SIRT KO cells, as well as parental cells. These results indicated the cytotoxicity of tenovin-6 was a SIRT-independent event. Instead, we found that tenovin-6 inhibited autophagy flux in canine HSA cells, as evidenced by the suppression of lysosomal proteolysis. These results suggested that tenovin-6 induces cell growth suppression in canine HSA cells by impairing the lysosomal function. Therefore, tenovin-6 could be used in a new therapeutic strategy to treat canine HSA.

Abstract: Summary
Naive and primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have provided useful insights into the regulation of pluripotency. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating naive conversion remain elusive. Here, we report intermediate naive conversion induced by overexpressing nuclear receptor 5A1 (NR5A1) in hPSCs. The cells displayed some naive features, such as clonogenicity, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) independence, expression of naive-associated genes, and two activated X chromosomes, but lacked others, such as KLF17 expression, transforming growth factor β independence, and imprinted gene demethylation. Notably, NR5A1 negated MAPK activation by fibroblast growth factor 2, leading to cell-autonomous self-renewal independent of MAPK inhibition. These phenotypes may be associated with naive conversion, and were regulated by a DPPA2/4-dependent pathway that activates the selective expression of naive-associated genes. This study increases our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the conversion from primed to naive pluripotency.

Abstract: UAP56 is an essential factor in eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export. Many viruses require cellular RNA export factors to efficiently export viral RNA. However, the mechanisms behind hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA splicing and nuclear export remain poorly understood. Here, our data show that UAP56 interacts with the HBx protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Q-motif of UAP56, which regulates RNA-binding and helicase activity, is essential for the interaction of UAP56 with HBx. Both knockdown of UAP56 and deficiency of HBx impaired cytoplasmic accumulation of HBV RNA transcripts, whereas knockdown of UAP56 also reduced the level of HBV pregenomic RNA splicing variants. In addition, knockdown of Nxf1 induced HBV RNA nuclear accumulation. These findings provide unique insights into the mechanistic details of HBV RNA export and splicing.

Abstract: Human αB-crystallin (HSPB5) is frequently modified post-translationally by UV radiation, oxidation, and age-associated processes, which complicates functional analyses of the protein using natural sources. Thus, determining the biological function of HSPB5 at the molecular structure level requires unmodified protein. Here, we employed an Escherichia coli cell-free protein synthesis system to prepare unmodified, functionally active human HSPB5. An S30 extract prepared from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for HSPB5 synthesis. The efficacy of protein synthesis was assessed by monitoring influencing factors, such as the concentrations of Mg2+ and other reaction mixture constituents, and by evaluating batch and/or dialysis synthesis systems. Chaperone-like activity of synthesized HSPB5 was assayed using alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) under thermal stress. The amount of HSPB5 synthesized using the cell-free system depended significantly on the concentration of Mg2+ in the reaction mixture. Use of condensed S30 extract and increased levels of amino acids promoted HSPB5 production. Compared with the batch system, HSPB5 synthesis was markedly increased using the dialysis system. The construction vector played a critical role in regulating the efficacy of protein synthesis. HSPB5 synthesized using the cell-free system had a native molecular mass, as determined by mass spectrometry analysis. The co-presence of synthesized HSPB5 suppressed heat-associated denaturation of ADH. Human HSPB5 synthesized using the cell-free system thus retains functional activity as a molecular chaperone.

Abstract: Summary
Ciliopathies are heterogeneous genetic diseases affecting primary cilium structure and function. Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Bardet-Biedl (BBS) syndromes are severe ciliopathies characterized by skeletal and neurodevelopment anomalies, including polydactyly, cognitive impairment, and retinal degeneration. We describe the generation and molecular characterization of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal sheets (RSs) from controls, and MKS (TMEM67) and BBS (BBS10) cases. MKS and BBS RSs displayed significant common alterations in the expression of hundreds of developmental genes and members of the WNT and BMP pathways. Induction of crystallin molecular chaperones was prominent in MKS and BBS RSs suggesting a stress response to misfolded proteins. Unique to MKS photoreceptors was the presence of supernumerary centrioles and cilia, and aggregation of ciliary proteins. Unique to BBS photoreceptors was the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This study reveals how combining cell reprogramming, organogenesis, and next-generation sequencing enables the elucidation of mechanisms involved in human ciliopathies.

Abstract: Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is an approach to treatment of neurodegenerative disorders with impaired proteostasis. Many neurons, including motor neurons affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are relatively resistant to stress-induced upregulation of HSPs. This study demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors enable the heat shock response in cultured spinal motor neurons, in a stress-dependent manner, and can improve the efficacy of HSP-inducing drugs in murine spinal cord cultures subjected to thermal or proteotoxic stress. The effect of particular HDAC inhibitors differed with the stress paradigm. The HDAC6 (class IIb) inhibitor, tubastatin A, acted as a co-inducer of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) expression with heat shock, but not with proteotoxic stress induced by expression of mutant SOD1 linked to familial ALS. Certain HDAC class I inhibitors (the pan inhibitor, SAHA, or the HDAC1/3 inhibitor, RGFP109) were HSP co-inducers comparable to the hydroxyamine arimoclomol in response to proteotoxic stress, but not thermal stress. Regardless, stress-induced Hsp70 expression could be enhanced by combining an HDAC inhibitor with either arimoclomol or with an HSP90 inhibitor that constitutively induced HSPs. HDAC inhibition failed to induce Hsp70 in motor neurons expressing ALS-linked mutant FUS, in which the heat shock response was suppressed; yet SAHA, RGFP109, and arimoclomol did reduce loss of nuclear FUS, a disease hallmark, and HDAC inhibition rescued the DNA repair response in iPSC-derived motor neurons carrying the FUSP525Lmutation, pointing to multiple mechanisms of neuroprotection by both HDAC inhibiting drugs and arimoclomol.

Abstract: Summary
Effective countermeasures against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) require the development of data and tools to understand and monitor its spread and immune responses to it. However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 plays an important role in health and is a therapeutic target for managing misfolding disease. Compounds that disrupt co-chaperone delivery of clients to Hsp90 target a subset of Hsp90 activities, thereby minimizing the toxicity of pan-Hsp90 inhibitors. Here, we have identified SEW04784 as a first-in-class inhibitor of the Aha1-stimulated Hsp90 ATPase activity without inhibiting basal Hsp90 ATPase. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis reveals that SEW84 binds to the C-terminal domain of Aha1 to weaken its asymmetric binding to Hsp90. Consistent with this observation, SEW84 blocks Aha1-dependent Hsp90 chaperoning activities, including the in vitro and in vivo refolding of firefly luciferase, and the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor in cell-based models of prostate cancer and promotes the clearance of phosphorylated tau in cellular and tissue models of neurodegenerative tauopathy. We propose that SEW84 provides a novel lead scaffold for developing therapeutic approaches to treat proteostatic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commensal of the human nasopharynx that can also cause severe antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotics drive the spread of resistance by inducing S. pneumoniae competence, in which bacteria express the transformation machinery that facilitates uptake of exogenous DNA and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We performed a high-throughput screen and identified potent inhibitors of S. pneumoniae competence, called COM-blockers. COM-blockers limit competence by inhibiting the proton motive force (PMF), thereby disrupting export of a quorum-sensing peptide that regulates the transformation machinery. Known chemical PMF disruptors and alterations in pH homeostasis similarly inhibit competence. COM-blockers limit transformation of clinical multi-drug-resistant strains and HGT in infected mice. At their active concentrations, COM-blockers do not affect growth, compromise antibiotic activity, or elicit detectable resistance. COM-blockers provide an experimental tool to inhibit competence and other PMF-involved processes and could help reduce the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Airway epithelium is the first body surface to contact inhaled irritants and report danger. Here, we report how epithelial cells recognize and respond to aeroallergen alkaline protease 1 (Alp1) of Aspergillus sp., because proteases are critical components of many allergens that provoke asthma. In a murine model, Alp1 elicits helper T (Th) cell-dependent lung eosinophilia that is initiated by the rapid response of bronchiolar club cells to Alp1. Alp1 damages bronchiolar cell junctions, which triggers a calcium flux signaled through calcineurin within club cells of the bronchioles, inciting inflammation. In two human cohorts, we link fungal sensitization and/or asthma with SNP/protein expression of the mechanosensitive calcium channel, TRPV4. TRPV4 is also necessary and sufficient for club cells to sensitize mice to Alp1. Thus, club cells detect junction damage as mechanical stress, which signals danger via TRPV4, calcium, and calcineurin to initiate allergic sensitization.

Abstract: Current studies have shown that POTE ankyrin domain family members have high expressions as tumor antigens in malignant tumors, such as prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and the like. POTEE is a member of the POTE anchor protein family E. However, its role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) has not been studied. In this study, the function of POTEE in CRC was examined for the first time and its correlation with CRC cell biological behaviors was analyzed. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed that POTEE was remarkably overexpressed in CRC and associated with an aggressive phenotype. We also found that POTEE was localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, downregulation of POTEE expression can notably inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cell in vitro, and repressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of POTEE could promote the aggressive behaviors of CRC cells. Mechanistically, POTEE promoted CRC migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. To summarize, these results suggested that POTEE might serve as an oncogene for CRC tumorigenesis and progression, and may become a novel molecular marker for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Overexpression of the c-Myc oncogene has been implicated in cancer stem cell - like (CSC) phenotypes and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which c-Myc regulates EMT and CSC potential in remains unclear. In the present study, we showed that the expression of c-Myc protein is inversely correlated with microRNA (miR)-200c expression in primary tumor samples from nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. We further demonstrated that Myc and miR-200c negatively regulate the expression each other in NPC cell lines. c-Myc transcriptionally repressed expression of miR-200c by directly binding to two E-box sites located within a 1 kb segment upstream of TSS of the miR-200c. In addition, miR-200c post-transcriptionally repressed expression of c-Myc by binding to its 3′-untranslated region, suggesting the existence of a negative feedback loop between Myc and miR-200c. Overexpression of c-Myc interfered with this feedback loop and activated the EMT program, induced CSC phenotypes, and enhanced drug sensitivity, whereas miR-200c could counteract these biological effects of c-Myc. Our results provide a novel mechanism governing c-Myc and miR-200c expression and indicate that either targeting c-Myc or restoring miR-200c expression would be a promising approach to overcome oncogenic role of c-Myc in NPC.

Abstract: Oxidative stress-induced retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) dysfunction is a primary contributing factor to early dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oxidative injury to the retina may promote extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from RPE. In this study, we investigated the effects of oxidative-induced RPE cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) on RPE cell functions. The oxidative stress induced more RMPs released from RPE cells in vitro and in vivo, and significant more RMPs were released from aged RPE cells than that from younger RPE cells. RMPs were taken up by RPE cells in a time-dependent manner; however, blockage of CD36 attenuated the uptake process. Furthermore, the decrease of RPE cell viability by RMPs treatment was associated with an increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15 and p21. RMPs enhanced senescence and interrupted phagocytic activity of RPE cells as well. The present study demonstrated that RMPs produce a strong effect of inducing RPE cell degeneration. This finding further supports the postulate that RMPs exacerbate oxidative stress damage to RPE cells, which may uncover a potentially relevant process in the genesis of dry AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Various populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Wnt signaling is variably activated in HCC and regulates CSCs and tumorigenesis. We explored cell-to-cell Wnt and stemness heterogeneity in HCC by labeling freshly isolated cancer cells with a Wnt-specific reporter, thereby identifying a small subset (0.4%–8.9%) of Wnt-activityhigh cells. Further cellular subset analysis identified a refined subset of Wnt-activityhighALDH1+EpCAM+ triple-positive (TP) cells as the most stem-like, phenotypically plastic, and tumorigenic among all putative CSC populations. These TP “superpotent CSCs” (spCSCs) specifically upregulate the expression of dishevelled 1 (DVL1) through the antagonism between abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) and the ubiquitin ligase complex Cullin-3/KLHL-12. Subsequent functional and molecular studies revealed the role of DVL1 in controlling spCSCs and their tumorigenic potential. These findings provide the mechanistic basis of the Wnt and stemness heterogeneity in HCC and highlight the important role of DVL1high spCSCs in tumor progression.

Abstract: Mucins are major macromolecular components of lung mucus that are mainly responsible for the viscoelastic property of mucus. MUC5AC is a major mucin glycoprotein that is hypersecreted in asthmatic individuals. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in inflammatory and airway blood vessel remodeling in asthmatics. Our previous studies indicate that VEGF upregulates MUC5AC expression by interacting with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). It has been shown that dexamethasone (Dex) downregulates MUC5AC expression; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effect of Dex on MUC5AC expression induced by VEGF and study the underlying mechanisms. We tested the effects of Dex on VEGFR2 and RhoA activation, caveolin-1 expression, and the association of caveolin-1 and VEGFR2 in primary bronchial epithelial cells. Dex downregulated MUC5AC mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and suppressed the activation of VEGFR2 and RhoA induced by VEGF. Additionally, Dex upregulated caveolin-1 protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, phospho-VEGFR2 expression was decreased through overexpression of caveolin-1 and increased after caveolin-1 knockdown. Dex treatment attenuated the VEGF-decreased association of caveolin-1 and VEGFR2. Collectively, our findings suggest that Dex downregulates VEGF-induced MUC5AC expression by inactivating VEGFR2 and RhoA. Furthermore, decreased MUC5AC expression by Dex was related to the increased association of caveolin-1 with VEGFR2. Further studies characterizing these mechanisms are required to facilitate the development of improved treatment strategies for asthma.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that CD44 variant 6 (CD44v6) is associated with prostate cancer (CaP) growth and therapeutic resistance in vitro, however, the role of CD44v6 in CaP in vivo is not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CD44v6 on CaP growth and chemo−/radiotherapy response in NOD/SCID mouse models in vivo and to validate its role as a therapeutic target for CaP therapy. CD44v6 was knocked down in PC-3M CaP cell line using short hairpin RNA. Subcutaneous (s.c.) and orthotopic CaP mouse xenografts were established. The effect of CD44v6 knockdown (KD) on tumour growth was evaluated in both s.c. and orthotopic models. Chemo−/radiotherapy response was evaluated in the s.c. model. Association of CD44v6 with PI3K/Akt pathway was validated using immunohistochemistry staining. We found that KD of CD44v6 significantly reduced tumour growth in both models, and enhanced the sensitivity of tumours to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the s.c. model. In addition, we demonstrated that KD of CD44v6 is associated with downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our data confirm that CaP growth and chemo−/radiosensitivity in vivo is associated with CD44v6, which holds great promises as a therapeutic target in the treatment of CaP.

Abstract: Summary
A treatment for intractable diseases is expected to be the replacement of damaged tissues with products from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Target cell purification is a critical step for realizing hiPSC-based therapy. Here, we found that hiPSC-derived ocular cell types exhibited unique adhesion specificities and growth characteristics on distinct E8 fragments of laminin isoforms (LNE8s): hiPSC-derived corneal epithelial cells (iCECs) and other non-CECs rapidly adhered preferentially to LN332/411/511E8 and LN211E8, respectively, through differential expression of laminin-binding integrins. Furthermore, LN332E8 promoted epithelial cell proliferation but not that of the other eye-related cells, leading to non-CEC elimination by cell competition. Combining these features with magnetic sorting, highly pure iCEC sheets were fabricated. Thus, we established a simple method for isolating iCECs from various hiPSC-derived cells without using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This study will facilitate efficient manufacture of iCEC sheets for corneal disease treatment and provide insights into target cell-specific scaffold selection.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant neuronal development and the persistence of mitotic cellular populations have been implicated in a multitude of neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). However, the mechanism underlying this potential pathology remains unclear. We used a modified protocol to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from HD patients and unaffected controls into neuronal cultures enriched for medium spiny neurons, the cell type most affected in HD. We performed single-cell and bulk transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses and demonstrated that a persistent cyclin D1+ neural stem cell (NSC) population is observed selectively in adult-onset HD iPSCs during differentiation. Treatment with a WNT inhibitor abrogates this NSC population while preserving neurons. Taken together, our findings identify a mechanism that may promote aberrant neurodevelopment and adult neurogenesis in adult-onset HD striatal neurons with the potential for therapeutic compensation.

Abstract: EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is accompanied by massive lymphocyte infiltration, but therapy resistance and tumor progression still occur in patients with EBVaGC. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are reported to possess immunomodulatory ability that allows them to resist immune-mediated rejection for many tumor types. However, whether and how CSCs in EBVaGC exhibit immunosuppression has not yet been elucidated. We isolated CSC-like sphere-forming cells (SFCs) from EBVaGC cell line SNU-719 using the cancer sphere method. We validated their CSC-associated properties in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, the ability to form colonies, and resistance to chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis and explored their immunomodulatory ability using the coculture system with PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell). These CSC-like SFCs were CD44+CD24-/low and were more tumorigenic than the parental SNU-719 cells in the xenograft mouse model. Remarkably, in the tumor-PBMC co-culturing experiments, these EBVaGC SFCs demonstrated profound immunosuppression by inhibiting the proliferation of PBMCs and T cell activation as well as inducing the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, the induction of Tregs was partially dependent on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced from SFCs. Moreover, the presence of high CD44+CD24-/low cells in tumor tissues predicted a decreased disease-free survival in patients with EBVaGC. Our study collectively confirmed the existence and immune resistance of CSCs in EBVaGC and offers new insights into the development of novel anti-EBVaGC strategies by targeting CSCs.

Abstract: Here, we monitored the expression of three genes (hsp70, hsp22, and hsf1) involved in heat shock response in Drosophila melanogaster in males and females of different age. Also, we investigated age- and sex-dependent expression of three major genes participating in the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (cse, cbs, and mst), implicated in stress resistance and aging. In addition to the control strain, we monitored the expression of all of these genes in a cbs knockout strain (cbs−/−) generated using the CRISPR technique. The tested strains differ in the induction capacities of the studied genes. Relative to the control strain, under normal conditions, the cbs−/− strain expresses all of the studied genes more abundantly, especially hsp22. In the control strain, aging leads to a dramatic increase in hsp22 synthesis, whereas in the cbs−/− strain, hsp22 induction is not pronounced. Furthermore, in 30-day-old cbs−/− flies, the constitutive expression of hsp70 and mst is decreased. Surprisingly, in the cbs−/− strain, we detected an upregulation of hsf1 transcription in the 30-day-old females. After heat shock in the control strain, hsp70 and hsp22 induction decreased with age in males and hsp22 decreased in females, while in the cbs−/− strain, a pronounced drop in the induction capacity of both hsp genes was seen in 30-day-old males and females. However, in most cases, the expression levels of hsf1 and H2S-producing genes do not exhibit pronounced changes depending on sex, age, or heat shock. Flies of control and cbs−/− strain exhibited strong reduction in basal thermotolerance with age. Our data suggest a cross-talk between the two studied ancient and universal adaptive systems.

Abstract: Dysregulation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is the main cause of a variety of ocular diseases. Potentially heat shock proteins, by preventing molecular and cellular damage and modulating inflammatory disease, may exert a protective role in eye disease. In particular, the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is widely upregulated in inflamed tissues, and in vivo upregulation of Hsp70 expression by HSP co-inducing compounds has been shown to be a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory diseases. In order to gain further understanding of the potential protective effects of Hsp70 in RPE cells, we developed a method for isolation and culture of canine RPE cells. Identity of RPE cells was confirmed by detection of its specific marker, RPE65, in qPCR, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry analysis. The ability of RPE cells to express Hsp70 upon experimental induction of cell stress, by arsenite, was analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, in search of a potential Hsp70 co-inducer, we investigated whether the compound leucinostatin could enhance Hsp70 expression in stressed RPE cells. Canine RPE cells were isolated and cultured successfully. Purity of cells that strongly expressed RPE65 was over 90%. Arsenite-induced stress led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in Hsp70 expression in canine RPE cells in vitro. In addition, leucinostatin, which enhanced heat shock factor-1-induced transcription from the heat shock promoter in DNAJB1-luc-O23 reporter cell line, also enhanced Hsp70 expression in arsenite-stressed RPE cells, in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings demonstrate that leucinostatin can boost Hsp70 expression in canine RPE cells, most likely by activating heat shock factor-1, suggesting that leucinostatin might be applied as a new co-inducer for Hsp70 expression.

Abstract: Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is one of the most effective drugs currently available for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). However, the intrinsic and acquired resistance to bortezomib can limit its effectiveness. The activation of heat shock response has been characterized as a potential resistance mechanism protecting MM cells from bortezomib-induced cell death. In this study, in response to bortezomib therapy, we discovered that HSP70 is one of the most substantially upregulated heat shock proteins. In order to further explore approaches to sensitizing bortezomib-based treatment for MM, we investigated whether targeting HSP70 using a specific inhibitor VER-155008 combined with bortezomib could overcome the acquired resistance in MM. We found that HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 alone significantly decreased MM cell viability. Moreover, the combination of VER-155008 and bortezomib synergistically induced MM cell apoptosis markedly in vitro. Notably, the combined treatment was found to increase the cleavage of PARP, an early marker of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Importantly, the reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 and the induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BH3-only protein NOXA and Bim were confirmed to be tightly associated with the synergism. Finally, the ER stress marker CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein), which can cause transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell apoptosis, was markedly induced by both VER-155008 and bortezomib. Taken together, our finding of a strong synergistic interaction between VER-155008 and bortezomib may support for combination therapy in MM patients in the future.

Abstract: Bovine mastitis is a common inflammatory disease caused by various factors. The main factor of mastitis is pathogenic microorganism infection, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus. Cronobacter sakazakii (C. sakazakii) is a newly discovered pathogenic bacteria in milk products, which seriously threat human health in recent years. At present, it has not been reported that the pathogenesis of mastitis is caused by C. sakazakii. This study investigated the inflammation of mammary gland epithelium, which was induced by C. sakazakii for the first time. We focused on bacterial isolation, histological observation, AIM2 inflammasome pathways, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. The results showed that C. sakazakii–induced inflammation caused damage of tissue, significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), activated the AIM2 inflammasome pathway (increased the expression of AIM2 and cleaved IL-1β), and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (increased the expression of ERdj4, Chop, Grp78) and apoptosis (increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, a marker of apoptosis). In conclusion, it is suggested that it maybe inhibite AIM2 inflammasome pathways and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) against the C. sakazakii–induced inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered proteins must be phenotypically selected for function in the appropriate physiological context. Here, we present a versatile approach that allows generating panels of mammalian cells that express diversified heterologous protein libraries in the cytosol or subcellular compartments under stable conditions and in a single-variant-per-cell manner. To this end we adapt CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology to diversify targeted stretches of a protein of interest in situ. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by in situ engineering and intra-lysosome specific selection of an extremely pH-resistant long Stokes shift red fluorescent protein variant. Tailoring properties to specific conditions of cellular sub-compartments or organelles of mammalian cells can be an important asset to optimize various proteins, protein-based tools, and biosensors for distinct functions.

Abstract: Phospholipid Phosphatase-Related Protein Type 1 (PLPPR1) is a six-transmembrane protein that belongs to the family of plasticity-related gene proteins, which is a novel brain-specific subclass of the lipid phosphate phosphatase superfamily. PLPPR1-5 have prominent roles in synapse formation and axonal pathfinding. We found that PLPPR1 overexpression in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2a) results in increase in cell adhesion and reduced cell migration. During migration, these cells leave behind long fibrous looking extensions of the plasma membrane causing a peculiar phenotype. Cells expressing PLPPR1 showed decreased actin turnover and decreased disassembly of focal adhesions. PLPPR1 also reduced active Rac1, and expressing dominant negative Rac1 produced a similar phenotype to overexpression of PLPPR1. The PLPPR1-induced phenotype of long fibers was reversed by introducing constitutively active Rac1. In summary, we show that PLPPR1 decreases active Rac1 levels that leads to cascade of events which increases cell adhesion.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 3 (TAB3) and the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus 1 (PIM1) are implicated in cancer development. In this study, we investigated the relationship between TAB3 and PIM1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and determined the potential role and molecular mechanism of TAB3 in PIM1-mediated CRC growth. We found that TAB3 and PIM1 expression levels were positively correlated in CRC tissues. The knockdown of TAB3 significantly decreased PIM1 expression and inhibited CRC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The upregulation of PIM1 rescued the decreased cell proliferation induced by TAB3 knockdown, whereas PIM1 knockdown decreased TAB3-enhanced CRC proliferation. Additionally, TAB3 regulates PIM1 expression through the STAT3 signalling pathway and confirmed a positive correlation between TAB3 and phosphorylated-STAT3 expression in CRC tissues. Patients with high expression of TAB3 and phosphorylated-STAT3 had the worst prognosis. Mechanistically, TAB3 regulates PIM1 expression by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation through the formation of the TAB3-TAK1-STAT3 complex. Overall, a novel CRC regulatory circuit involving the TAB3-TAK1-STAT3 complex and PIM1 was identified, the dysfunction of which may contribute to CRC tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Patients with estrogen receptor α positive (ERα+) breast cancer can respond to endocrine therapy, but treatment resistance is common and associated with downregulation of ERα expression in the dormant residual cells. Here we show, using long-term NSG xenograft models of human breast cancer and primary human monocytes, in vitro primary cell cultures and tumors from breast cancer patients, that macrophage derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) downregulates ERα in breast cancer cells via inactivation of the transcription factor Forkhead box O transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a). Moreover, presence of tumor associated macrophages in the primary tumor of breast cancer patients, was associated with ERα negativity, and with worse prognosis in patients with ERα+ tumors. We propose that pro-inflammatory macrophages, despite being tumoricidal, may have direct effects on tumor progression and endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients. Our findings suggest that TNFα antagonists should be evaluated for treatment of ERα+ breast cancer.

Abstract: Radioresistance observed in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) may be related to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), but the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can regulate the stemness of cancer cells and tumor radiosensitivity. In addition, exosomes have been reported to modify treatment response by mediating cell–cell communication. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether exosomes derived from CAFs (CAF-exosomes) are involved in mediating resistance to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer and to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that CSCs were inherently resistant to cell death induced by radiotherapy. CAF-derived CM promoted clonogenicity and radioresistance of CRC cells. Further investigations revealed that exosomes isolated from CM induced the above effects whereas exosome-depleted CM (solution) was not able to induce clonogenicity and radioresistance. Finally, exosomes could activate transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody inhibit this effect and decrease clonogenicity and expression levels of stemness genes. In conclusion,our ﬁndings suggest CAFs promote stemness of CRC cells and thus increase radiation resistance. Exosomes derived from CAFs play a crucial role through activating TGF-β signaling pathway in this process.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process involved in tissue morphogenesis and disease that causes dramatic changes in cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and gene expression. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which supports the neural retina, can undergo EMT, producing fibrous epiretinal membranes (ERMs) associated with vision-impairing clinical conditions, such as macular pucker and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). We found that co-treatment with TGF-β and TNF-α (TNT) accelerates EMT in adult human RPE stem cell-derived RPE cell cultures. We captured the global epigenomic and transcriptional changes elicited by TNT treatment of RPE and identified putative active enhancers associated with actively transcribed genes, including a set of upregulated transcription factors that are candidate regulators. We found that the vitamin B derivative nicotinamide downregulates these key transcriptional changes, and inhibits and partially reverses RPE EMT, revealing potential therapeutic routes to benefit patients with ERM, macular pucker and PVR.

Abstract: Articular cartilage defects are one of the major challenges in orthopedic and trauma surgery. However, the poor ability of cartilage to self-repair has motivated efforts to engineer replacement tissues, and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which have an extensive proliferation potential and can undergo chondrogenesis, have emerged as a promising cell source. In this review, we attempt to provide a brief overview of MSC isolation, characterization, current manufacturing platforms using various bioreactors, in vitro differentiation, and sealant-based or scaffold-based implantation.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), proved to have renoprotective effects in various renal diseases. Therefore, this study investigated the renoprotective effect of H2S, in a renal injury model, and its crosstalk with other gasotransmitters such as CO. Thirty-two adult rats were divided into four groups: control, gentamicin (GEN)-treated, GEN + sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), and GEN + NaHS + zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) groups. GEN was used to induce renal injury, NaHS is a water-soluble H2S, and ZnPP is a selective heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor used to inhibit CO synthesis in vivo. NaHS improved kidney functions in the GEN group as evidenced by significantly lower levels of renal injury markers: serum urea, creatinine, uric acid, urinary albumin excretion, and urinary albumin/creatinine. Moreover, NaHS administration to the GEN-treated group significantly lowered renal levels of NO and tumor necrosis factor-α with an increase in total antioxidant, HO-1, and interleukin-10 levels. Furthermore, NaHS administration downregulated the GEN-induced overexpression of the renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and upregulated the suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with improvement in the histological examination and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. However, this improvement in kidney function produced by NaHS was reduced by combination with ZnPP but still improved as compared with the GEN-treated group. The renoprotective effects of H2S can be through its effects on renal tissue antioxidants, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of eNOS and iNOS which can be partially dependent on CO pathway via induction of HO-1 enzyme.

Abstract: Summary
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare, genetic disease in which increased very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the central nervous system (CNS) cause demyelination and axonopathy, leading to neurological deficits. Sobetirome, a potent thyroid hormone agonist, has been shown to lower VLCFAs in the periphery and CNS. In this study, two pharmacological strategies for enhancing the effects of sobetirome were tested in Abcd1 KO mice, a murine model with the same inborn error of metabolism as X-ALD patients. First, a sobetirome prodrug (Sob-AM2) with increased CNS penetration lowered CNS VLCFAs more potently than sobetirome and was better tolerated with reduced peripheral exposure. Second, co-administration of thyroid hormone with sobetirome enhanced VLCFA lowering in the periphery but did not produce greater lowering in the CNS. These data support the conclusion that CNS VLCFA lowering in Abcd1 knockout mice is limited by a mechanistic threshold related to slow lipid turnover.

Abstract: Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis upon chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It has been documented that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment improved hematopoietic stem cell function in vitro and in vivo, while the relationship between PGE2 and intestinal stem cells remains unclear. Presently, mice were exposed to PGE1, dmPGE2 and indomethacin. Numbers and function of ISCs were assessed by analyzing Olfm4+ ISCs. Intestinal protection of dmPGE2 was investigated on a 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-induced intestinal damage mouse model. The results showed that dmPGE2 treatment, but not PGE1, increased numbers of Olfm4+ ISCs in dose- and time-dependent manners. Indomethacin treatment decreased numbers of Olfm4+ ISCs. The beneficial effects of short-term dmPGE2 treatment on intestine were supported in a 5FU-induced intestinal damage model. Our data showed that 5FU treatment significantly decreased numbers of Olfm4+ ISCs and goblet cells in intestine, which could be ameliorated by dmPGE2 treatment. dmPGE2 treatment accelerated the recovery of 5FU-induced ISC injury via increasing expression of cyclin D1 and D2 in intestine. Furthermore, dmPGE2 treatment-induced expression of cyclin D1 and D2 might be mediated by up-regulation of FOXM1 expression in intestine. These findings feature PGE2 as an effective protector against chemotherapy-induced intestinal damage.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of TMEM173/STING-dependent innate immunity has recently provided guidance for the prevention and management of inflammatory disorders. Here, we show that myeloid TMEM173 occupies an essential role in regulating coagulation in bacterial infections through a mechanism independent of type I interferon response. Mechanistically, TMEM173 binding to ITPR1 controls calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum in macrophages and monocytes. The TMEM173-dependent increase in cytosolic calcium drives Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and activation, which triggers the release of F3, the key initiator of blood coagulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the TMEM173-GSDMD-F3 pathway blocks systemic coagulation and improves animal survival in three models of sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture or bacteremia with Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae infection). The upregulation of the TMEM173 pathway correlates with the severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation and mortality in patients with sepsis. Thus, TMEM173 is a key regulator of blood clotting during lethal bacterial infections.

Abstract: Summary
The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variation in immune responses are poorly understood. Here, we performed a phenotypic analysis of immunological parameters in laboratory mice carrying susceptibility genes implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Nod2 and Atg16l1) upon exposure to environmental microbes. Mice were released into an outdoor enclosure (rewilded) and then profiled for immune responses in the blood and lymph nodes. Variations of immune cell populations were largely driven by the environment, whereas cytokine production elicited by microbial antigens was more affected by the genetic mutations. We identified transcriptional signatures in the lymph nodes associated with differences in T cell populations. Subnetworks associated with responses against Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, and Bacteroides vulgatus were also coupled with rewilding. Therefore, exposing laboratory mice with genetic mutations to a natural environment uncovers different contributions to variations in microbial responses and immune cell composition.

Abstract: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T cells, causing lysis of malignant cells. Transplantation biology studies have implicated HLA class I molecules in cell migration, but there has been little evidence presented that they influence cancer cell migration, a contributing factor in metastasis. In this study, we examined the effect of HLA-B on pancreatic cancer cell migration. HLA-B siRNA transfection increased the migration of the S2-013 pancreatic cancer cells but, in contrast, reduced migration of the PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Integrin molecules have previously been implicated in the upregulation of pancreatic cancer cell migration, and knockdown of HLA-B in S2-013 cells heightened the expression of integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), but in the PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells HLA-B knockdown diminished ITGB1 expression. A transmembrane sequence in an S2-013 HLA-B heavy chain matches a corresponding sequence in HLA-B in the BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line, and knockdown of BxPC-3 HLA-B mimics the effect of S2-013 HLA-B knockdown on migration. In total, our findings indicate that HLA-B influences the expression of ITGB1 in pancreatic cancer cells, with concurrent distinctions in transmembrane sequences and effects on the migration of the cells.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptors are a major class of membrane receptors that mediate physiological and pathophysiological cellular signaling. Many aspects of receptor activation and signaling can be investigated using genetically encoded luminescent fusion proteins. However, the use of these biosensors in live cell systems requires the exogenous expression of the tagged protein of interest. To maintain the normal cellular context here we use CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair to insert luminescent tags into the endogenous genome. Using NanoLuc and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer we demonstrate fluorescent ligand binding at genome-edited chemokine receptors. We also demonstrate that split-NanoLuc complementation can be used to investigate conformational changes and internalization of CXCR4 and that recruitment of β-arrestin2 to CXCR4 can be monitored when both proteins are natively expressed. These results show that genetically encoded luminescent biosensors can be used to investigate numerous aspects of receptor function at native expression levels.

Abstract: The European Bank for induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC) has collected iPSC lines associated with genetic diseases and healthy controls from across Europe and made these available for research use to international academic and commercial users. Ensuring availability of consistently high quality iPSCs at scale and from various sources requires quality systems which are flexible yet robust, maximising the utilisation of available resources. Here, we outline the establishment and implementation of a quality control regime suitable for a large-scale operational setting. Strict release testing ensures the safety and integrity of distributed iPSC lines, whilst informational testing allows publication of full characterisation and assessment of iPSC lines. Quality control screening is underpinned by a ‘fit-for-purpose’ Quality Management System giving full traceability and supporting continuous scientific and process development. Evaluation and qualification of key assays and techniques ensures that assay sensitivities and limits of detection are acceptable. Use of rapid testing techniques in place of more ‘traditional’ assays allows EBiSC to respond quickly to user demand, generating fully qualified iPSC line banks in a labour-saving and cost-efficient manner.

Abstract: MiR-328–3p has been reported to be downregulated and serve as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. Previous studies only have reported the downregulation of miR-328–3p in CRC. However, the roles of miR-328–3p in CRC growth and metastasis were unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-328–3p overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was also inactivated by miR-328–3p overexpression. MiR-328–3p knockdown showed the opposite effects. In addition, we confirmed that miR-328–3p directly bound to 3′UTR of Girdin and negatively regulated its expression. Girdin knockdown or treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the effects of miR-328–3p inhibitor on cell proliferation, metastasis, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, pre-miR-328 decreased numbers of liver metastatic nodules, and reduced the levels of p-Akt, p-Girdin, and Girdin in metastatic tissues in liver. In conclusion, miR-328–3p may inhibit proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells by targeting Girdin and inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. MiR-328–3p may be a novel target in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is a phenomenon of irreversible growth arrest of mammalian somatic cells. Senescent cells increase the production of secretory proteins such as inflammatory cytokines, a phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP is known to have profound effects on organismal health and aging; however, the molecular mechanisms of SASP are not precisely understood. In our previous studies, we have shown that senescent cells show decreased function of lamin B receptor (LBR), a nuclear membrane protein that regulates heterochromatin organization. Here we examined the implication of LBR in the regulation of SASP because senescent cells show altered heterochromatin organization, which would affect gene expression. We found that knock-down of LBR up-regulated the expression of the SASP factors such as IL-6, IL-8, and MMP1 in HeLa cells, even though cellular senescence was not induced by LBR knock-down. Conversely, enforced expression of LBR suppressed their up-regulated expression in senescent cells induced by excess thymidine. Further, our gene expression profile analysis also showed that many secretory proteins were up-regulated by LBR knock-down. We then analyzed the regulatory mechanisms of the expression of SASP factors by LBR, and found that the promoters of these SASP factors associated with LBR in normally growing cells, but dissociated from it in senescent cells. Additionally, we found that enforced expression of LBR decreased the generation of cytoplasmic DNA, which could be involved in SASP, in senescent cells. These findings suggested that LBR would play crucial roles in the regulation of SASP.

Abstract: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were initially identified as an important antimicrobial barrier to capture and kill microorganisms. Emerging evidence suggests that NETs play a crucial role in chronic airway inflammation induced by cigarette smoke (CS). However, how NETs form and the mechanisms by which NETs function in CS-related airway diseases are still unclear. To explore NET formation and its potential role in CS-related airway diseases, we first established a CS-induced subacute airway inflammation model in mice and verified NET formation in the airways. Moreover, NETs degradation by aerosolized DNase I treatment significantly inhibited the airway inflammation induced by CS in mice. More importantly, by in vitro experiments, we found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induces NET formation in an NADPH oxidase-dependent manner, and that macrophages and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEs) are important targets for the NETs-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, NETs may represent a critical link among neutrophils, macrophages and HBEs under chronic inflammation conditions induced by CS.

Abstract: Background
Prodrugs are medications or compounds that, after administration, can be converted into pharmacologically active drugs through metabolism. Unlike conventional drugs, prodrugs have reduced adverse or unintended effects, which could become critical limitations in treatments such as chemotherapy. Previously through computer-aided drug design and chemical synthesis, we have obtained and examined a prodrug N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Asn-Doxorubicin (CBZ-AAN-DOX). CBZ-AAN-DOX is essentially Doxorubicin that is chemically-modified with tripeptides to target Legumain, a highly expressed protein in cancer cells and is involved in tumor metastasis and tumor microvessel formation. The difficulty to test the safety and efficacy of the prodrug (including the pharmacodynamic parameters of CBZ-AAN-DOX on metastasis and invasion of tumors, as well as cardiac and vascular toxicity) primarily comes from the lack of appropriate experimental models.
Methods
Human cervical cancer cell lines CaSki under hypoxic conditions were used to evaluate the cell viability by CCK-8 assay after the prodrug treatment. Western blotting method was performed for Legumain protein determination in the cell culture. Wound healing and transwell invasion assays were performed to determine the effects of the prodrug on tumor metastasis and invasion, respectively. Zebrafish models were constructed for toxicity and angiogenesis visual analysis after in vivo treatment with the prodrug.
Results
The CCK-8 results showed that CBZ-AAN-DOX exhibits an IC50 of 28.7 μM in 48 h on CaSki cells that had a lower cell inhibition rate than DOX 80.3 μM for 24 h. Legumain expression was significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in 48 h under hypoxia conditions. The results also showed that 13.9 μM of the prodrug significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of cells and the effects were significantly stronger than that of 41.8 μM of DOX under hypoxia conditions after 48 h. The effects of 160 μM of the prodrug on the survival rate of zebrafish after 72 h and heart-toxicity showed no obvious abnormalities. Cell metastasis and angiogenesis were also inhibited in tumor-bearing zebrafish model.
Conclusion
The findings in this study demonstrated that CBZ-AAN-DOX is a promising chemotherapy candidate with low toxicity and high efficiency for cervical cancer. Remarkably, the hypoxic culture model together with the zebrafish model serve as a good system for the evaluation of the toxicity, targeting and impact of the prodrug on tumor invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian cancer (OC) represents the most dismal gynecological cancer. Pathobiology is poorly understood, mainly due to lack of appropriate study models. Organoids, defined as self-developing three-dimensional in vitro reconstructions of tissues, provide powerful tools to model human diseases. Here, we established organoid cultures from patient-derived OC, in particular from the most prevalent high-grade serous OC (HGSOC). Testing multiple culture medium components identified neuregulin-1 (NRG1) as key factor in maximizing OC organoid development and growth, although overall derivation efficiency remained moderate (36% for HGSOC patients, 44% for all patients together). Established organoid lines showed patient tumor-dependent morphology and disease characteristics, and recapitulated the parent tumor's marker expression and mutational landscape. Moreover, the organoids displayed tumor-specific sensitivity to clinical HGSOC chemotherapeutic drugs. Patient-derived OC organoids provide powerful tools for the study of the cancer's pathobiology (such as importance of the NRG1/ERBB pathway) as well as advanced preclinical tools for (personalized) drug screening and discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The effects of ascorbate on adult cell fate specification remain largely unknown. Using our stepwise and chemically defined system to derive lateral mesoderm progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we found that ascorbate increased the expression of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) markers, purity of MSCs, the long-term self-renewal and osteochondrogenic capacity of hPSC-MSCs in vitro. Moreover, ascorbate promoted MSC specification in an iron-dependent fashion, but not in a redox-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that iron synergized with ascorbate to regulate hPSC-MSC histone methylation, promote their long-term self-renewal, and increase their osteochondrogenic capacity. We found that one of the histone demethylases affected by ascorbate, KDM4B, was necessary to promote the specification of hPSC-MSCs. This mechanistic understanding led to the metabolic optimization of hPSC-MSCs with an extended lifespan in vitro and the ability to fully repair cartilage defects upon transplantation in vivo. Our results highlight the importance of ascorbate and iron metabolism in adult human cell fate specification.

Abstract: Neurotoxicity is mediated by a variety of modes-of-actions leading to disturbance of neuronal function. In order to screen larger numbers of compounds for their neurotoxic potential, in vitro functional neuronal networks (NN) might be helpful tools. We established and characterized human NN (hNN) from hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells by comparing hNN formation with two different differentiation media: in presence (CINDA) and absence (neural differentiation medium (NDM)) of maturation-supporting factors. As a NN control we included differentiating rat NN (rNN) in the study. Gene/protein expression and electrical activity from in vitro developing NN were assessed at multiple time points. Transcriptomes of 5, 14 and 28 days in vitro CINDA-grown hNN were compared to gene expression profiles of in vivo human developing brains. Molecular expression analyses as well as measures of electrical activity indicate that NN mature into neurons of different subtypes and astrocytes over time. In contrast to rNN, hNN are less electrically active within the same period of differentiation time, yet hNN grown in CINDA medium develop higher firing rates than hNN without supplements. Challenge of NN with neuronal receptor stimulators and inhibitors demonstrate presence of inhibitory, GABAergic neurons, whereas glutamatergic responses are limited. hiPSC-derived GABAergic hNN grown in CINDA medium might be a useful tool as part of an in vitro battery for assessing neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
The development of an in vitro system in which human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) are generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been invaluable to further our understanding of human primordial germ cell (hPGC) specification. However, the means to evaluate the next fundamental steps in germ cell development have not been well established. In this study we describe a two dimensional extended culture system that promotes proliferation of specified hPGCLCs, without reversion to a pluripotent state. We demonstrate that hPGCLCs in extended culture undergo partial epigenetic reprogramming, mirroring events described in hPGCs in vivo, including a genome-wide reduction in DNA methylation and maintenance of depleted H3K9me2. This extended culture system provides a new approach for expanding the number of hPGCLCs for downstream technologies, including transplantation, molecular screening, or possibly the differentiation of hPGCLCs into gametes by in vitro gametogenesis.

Abstract: Stable intracellular and intercellular osmolarity is vital for all physiological processes. Although it is the first organ that receives food, the osmolarity around the mouth epithelium has never been systematically investigated. We found that oral epithelial cells are a population of ignored cells routinely exposed to hypertonic environments mainly composed of saline, glucose, etc. in vivo after chewing food. By using cultured oral epithelial cells as an in vitro model, we found that the hypotonic environments caused by both high NaCl and high glucose induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Transcriptomics revealed similar expression profiles after high NaCl and high glucose stimulation. Most of the common differentially expressed genes were enriched in “mitophagy” and “autophagy” according to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Hypertonic stimulation for 1 to 6 h resulted in autophagosome formation. The activation of autophagy protected cells from high osmolarity-induced cell death. The activation of Hsp70 by the pharmacological activator handelin significantly improved the cell survival rate after hypertonic stimulation. The protective role of Hsp70 activation was partially dependent on autophagy activation, indicating a crosstalk between Hsp70 and autophagy in hypertonic stress response. The extract of the handelin-containing herb Chrysanthemum indicum significantly protected oral epithelial cells from hypertonic-induced death, providing an inexpensive way to protect against hypertonic-induced oral epithelial damage. In conclusion, the present study emphasized the importance of changes in osmolarity in oral health for the first time. The identification of novel compounds or herbal plant extracts that can activate autophagy or HSPs may contribute to oral health and the food industry.

Abstract: Summary
Rare mutations have been proposed to restrict the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, but this has not been explicitly demonstrated. We hypothesized that such rare mutations might be identified by comparing broadly neutralizing and non-broadly neutralizing branches of an antibody-developmental tree. Because sequences of antibodies isolated from the fusion peptide (FP)-targeting VRC34-antibody lineage suggested it might be suitable for such rare mutation analysis, we carried out next-generation sequencing (NGS) on B cell transcripts from donor N123, the source of the VRC34 lineage, and functionally and structurally characterized inferred intermediates along broadly neutralizing and poorly neutralizing developmental branches. The broadly neutralizing VRC34.01 branch required the rare heavy-chain mutation Y33P to bind FP, whereas the early bifurcated VRC34.05 branch did not require this rare mutation and evolved less breadth. Our results demonstrate how a required rare mutation can restrict development and shape the maturation of a broad HIV-1-neutralizing antibody lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein that exhibits repulsive neurite guidance and regulates neuronal differentiation and survival during brain development. However, the function of RGMa in the adult brain is unknown. Here, we show that RGMa is expressed in the adult hippocampus and provide evidence that RGMa signaling suppresses adult neurogenesis. Knockdown of RGMa in the dentate gyrus increased the number of surviving newborn neurons; however, these cells failed to properly migrate into the granular cell layer. In vitro, RGMa stimulation of adult neural stem cells suppressed neurite outgrowth of newborn neurons, which could be prevented by knockdown of the multifunctional receptor neogenin, as well as pharmacological inhibition of the downstream target Rho-associated protein kinase. These findings present a function for RGMa in the adult brain and add to the intricate molecular network that regulates adult brain plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
To survive and proliferate in diverse host environments with varying nutrient availability, the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii reprograms its metabolism. We have generated and curated a genome-scale metabolic model (iTgo) for the fast-replicating tachyzoite stage, harmonized with experimentally observed phenotypes. To validate the importance of four metabolic pathways predicted by the model, we have performed in-depth in vitro and in vivo phenotyping of mutant parasites including targeted metabolomics and CRISPR-Cas9 fitness screening of all known metabolic genes. This led to unexpected insights into the remarkable flexibility of the parasite, addressing the dependency on biosynthesis or salvage of fatty acids (FAs), purine nucleotides (AMP and GMP), a vitamin (pyridoxal-5P), and a cofactor (heme) in both the acute and latent stages of infection. Taken together, our experimentally validated metabolic network leads to a deeper understanding of the parasite’s biology, opening avenues for the development of therapeutic intervention against apicomplexans.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) leads an unfolded protein response (UPR) which results in internal cellular responses such as proteostasis and protein clearance. Recently, several reports demonstrated that the ER stress in stem cells could affect their stemness and fates to differentiate into certain lineages. However, the potential for controlling differentiation and function of cells by regulating ER stress needs to be further addressed. Here, we demonstrated that relieving the ER stress in cell cultures enhances the functionalities of hPSC-derived hepatocytes and other hepatic cells to be used in various research fields. Firstly, we found that UPR genes were up-regulated during hepatic differentiation of hPSCs and treatment of ER stress reliever at the hepatic induction stage of the differentiation resulted the enhanced mature marker expressions and glycogen storage of the differentiated hepatocytes. The treatment of ER stress reliever also improved the maintenance of hepatic characteristics in long-term culture of hPSC-derived hepatocytes. Furthermore, relieving ER stress increased the hepatic marker expression and CYP3A4 activity in hepatoma cell lines and human primary hepatocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate that regulating ER stress of in vitro cultured hepatocytes might be a crucial factor for enhancing differentiation, function and maintaining hepatic identity.

Abstract: Summary
Although the gut microbiome is generally symbiotic or commensal, some microbiome members become pathogenic under certain circumstances. However, the factors driving this pathogenic switch are largely unknown. Pathogenic bacteria can generate uracil that triggers host dual oxidase (DUOX) to produce antimicrobial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We show that pathogens generate uracil and ribose upon nucleoside catabolism of gut luminal uridine, which triggers not only host defenses but also inter-bacterial communication and pathogenesis in Drosophila. Uridine-derived uracil triggers DUOX-dependent ROS generation, whereas ribose induces bacterial quorum sensing (QS) and virulence gene expression. Genes implicated in nucleotide metabolism are found in pathogens but not commensal bacteria, and their genetic ablation blocks QS and the commensal-to-pathogen transition in vivo. Furthermore, commensal bacteria lack functional nucleoside catabolism, which is required to achieve gut-microbe symbiosis, but can become pathogenic by enabling nucleotide catabolism. These findings reveal molecular mechanisms governing the commensal-to-pathogen transition in different contexts of host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Free-living mammals, such as humans and wild mice, display heightened immune activation compared with artificially maintained laboratory mice. These differences are partially attributed to microbial exposure as laboratory mice infected with pathogens exhibit immune profiles more closely resembling that of free-living animals. Here, we examine how colonization by microorganisms within the natural environment contributes to immune system maturation by releasing inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In addition to enhancing differentiation of T cell populations previously associated with pathogen exposure, outdoor release increased circulating granulocytes. However, these “rewilded” mice were not infected by pathogens previously implicated in immune activation. Rather, immune system changes were associated with altered microbiota composition with notable increases in intestinal fungi. Fungi isolated from rewilded mice were sufficient in increasing circulating granulocytes. These findings establish a model to investigate how the natural environment impacts immune development and show that sustained fungal exposure impacts granulocyte numbers.

Abstract: GRWD1 is a member of the WD repeat protein family that is over-expressed in various cancer cell lines and associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. However, its biological function and mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of GRWD1 in NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens from 170 patients showed that GRWD1 is highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and positively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and P-TNM stage, but negatively correlated with differentiation and prognosis. We found that GRWD1 promotes cell colony formation by affecting the expression of Cyclin B1, CDK1, and p27 and inducing G2/M transition. GRWD1 was also found to stimulate cell migration through RhoA, RhoC, and CDC42, and induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition by affecting the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Zeb1, and ZO-1. Our results indicated that the GRWD1 can activate the Notch signaling pathway by affecting the Notch intracellular domain and promoting the expression of Hes1. Our use of DAPT to suppress Notch signaling confirmed that GRWD1 promotes the progression of NSCLC through the Notch signaling pathway and may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for this disease.

Abstract: Objective
Vascular permeability contributes to disease progression and drug resistance in hematological malignancies, including AML. Thus, targeting angiogenic signaling is a promising treatment strategy, especially for relapsed and resistant AML. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of apatinib, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets VEGFR2.
Methods
Several AML cell lines were exposed to various concentrations of apatinib, and then CCK8 and Annexin V/PI assays were performed to determine IC50 values and apoptosis, respectively. The effect of apatinib against primary AML cells from 57 adult patients and 11 normal controls was also analyzed utilizing an apoptosis assay. Next, we tested the underlying mechanism of apatinib in AML using western blotting and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Finally, the activity of apatinib against tumor growth and angiogenesis was further evaluated in vivo in xenograft models.
Results
We found apatinib signiﬁcantly inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines in vitro. Similarly, apatinib showed cytotoxicity against primary AML cells but didn't affect normal BMMCs. Its effect was highly correlated with several clinical features, such as NPM1 mutation, extramedullary infiltration, relapsed/refractory disease, and M2 and M5 FAB subtypes. In addition, apatinib suppressed AML growth and attenuated angiogenesis in xenograft models. Mechanistically, apatinib-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with inhibition of the VEGFR2-mediated Src/STAT3 and AKT/mTOR pathways and induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.
Conclusion
Apatinib exerts antileukemia effects by targeting VEGFR2-induced prosurvival signaling and angiogenesis, thus providing a rationale for the application of apatinib in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent molecules have contributed to basic biological research but there are currently only a limited number of probes available for the detection of non-enzymatic proteins. Here, we report turn-on fluorescent probes mediated by conjugate addition and cyclization (TCC probes). These probes react with multiple amino acids and exhibit a 36-fold greater emission intensity after reaction. We analyzed the reactions between TCC probes and nuclear receptors by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, spectrofluorometry, and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro analysis showed that probes consisting of a protein ligand and TCC could label vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Moreover, we demonstrated that not only a ligand unit but also a peptide unit can label the target protein in a complex mixture.

Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their M2-type extremely promote tumor angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nogo-B is expressed in most tissues and participates in macrophage polarization. However, whether Nogo-B is involved in the polarization and the effects of TAMs has been unclear. The expression of Nogo-B in TAMs of HCC patients is significantly increased, which correlated with the poor prognosis of the patients with HCC. Coincidentally, HCC conditioned medium (HCM) facilitated Nogo-B expression and the M2 phenotype of macrophages. Nogo-B knockdown Nogo-B significantly suppressed the M2-type polarization of macrophages and inhibited HCC cells proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, interference of Nogo-B facilitates macrophage-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Nogo-B meaningfully enhanced IL4-stimulated the alternative activation of macrophages as well as expression of the transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein (Yap)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz). An inhibitor of Yap, Verteporfin, could block Nogo-B-Yap/Taz-mediated macrophages M2 polarization. Nogo-B expression in macrophages facilitates tumor-associated macrophages M2 polarization and protumoral effects of TAMs in HCC. Targeting Nogo-B/Yap/Taz in macrophages could provide a new therapeutic strategy in HCC therapy.

Abstract: The proliferation and migration of Schwann cells contribute to nerve regeneration after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). In recent years, roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PNI have been gradually uncovered. However, a highly conserved nuclear lncRNA Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) in peripheral nerve regeneration remains enigmatic. MALAT1 expression in injured sciatic nerve of mice with PNI was measured by real-time PCR. The proliferative and migrative abilities of Schwann cells were determined after upregulating or downregulating Malat1. The relationship among MALAT1, miR-129-5p, and BDNF was measured. In this study, we found elevated MALAT1 expression in injured sciatic nerve. MALAT1 upregulation in Schwann cells promoted cell proliferation and migration. However, downregulation of MALAT1 caused the suppression of Schwann cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, we discovered MALAT1 negatively regulated miR-129-5p through directly binding. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a target of miR-129-5p. MALAT1 positively modulated BDNF expression and secretion via decreasing miR-129-5p. Downregulation of BDNF rescued the influences of MALAT1 overexpression on Schwann cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, MALAT1 was enhanced after PNI and it promoted the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells through sponging miR-129-5p to increase BDNF expression and secretion. This study proved that MALAT1 may be a vital regulator in peripheral nerve regeneration.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) recruitment and angiogenesis play crucial roles in aneurysm neck endothelialization, but the mechanisms of EPC recruitment and angiogenesis are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate the function and differentiation of cells in various ways. LncRNA TUG1 is involved in liver cancer and glioma-mediated angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA TUG1 in regulating EPC migration and differentiation. Overexpression and knockdown of lncRNA TUG1 with lentivirus, scratch assays, Transwell assays and tube formation assays using EPCs isolated from rat bone marrow showed that lncRNA TUG1 overexpression promoted EPC migration, invasion and differentiation. Moreover, ELISAs showed that lncRNA TUG1 overexpression increased VEGF expression. Bioinformatics prediction, luciferase assays, Western blots and RIP assays indicated that lncRNA TUG1 functions as a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) for miR-6321 and that miR-6321 inhibits EPC migration and differentiation through its target, ATF2. As a potential therapeutic target, lncRNA TUG1 may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of aneurysms.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures lead to decreased life quality and high healthcare costs. Current treatments prevent losses in bone mass and fractures to some extent but have side effects. Therefore, better therapies are needed. This study investigated whether the transcription factor Jun has a specific pro-osteogenic potency and whether modulating Jun could serve as a novel treatment for osteoporosis-associated fractures. We demonstrate that ectopically transplanted whole bones and distinct osteoprogenitors increase bone formation. Perinatal Jun induction disturbs growth plate architecture, causing a striking phenotype with shortened and thickened bones. Molecularly, Jun induces hedgehog signaling in skeletal stem cells. Therapeutically, Jun accelerates bone growth and healing in a drilling-defect model. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Jun drives bone formation by expanding osteoprogenitor populations and forcing them into the bone fate, providing a rationale for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease with poor prognosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been reported to play an important role in IPF. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) cascade, which regulates EMT and oncogenesis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. Calpains, Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinases that mediate controlled proteolysis of many specific substrates including epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, participate in organ fibrosis. Calpain-1 and calpain-2 of calpain family are ubiquitous calpains. ERK1/2 signaling stimulates the ubiquitous calpains activity in cancer development, but whether ERK1/2 signaling mediates the ubiquitous calpains activity in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Here we investigated whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and the ubiquitous calpains attenuated experimental pulmonary fibrosis and examined the potential mechanism. Our results showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and the ubiquitous calpains both attenuated bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling downregulated the expression of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in vivo and in vitro. We detected decreased E-cadherin expression and increased calpain-1 expression in IPF patients. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and the ubiquitous calpains both suppressed the development of EMT in vivo and in vitro. Our study indicated that inhibition of the ERK1/2-ubiquitous calpains pathway protected pulmonary fibrosis from BLM, possibly via inhibition of EMT. Therefore, targeting ubiquitous calpains may be a potential strategy to attenuate IPF.

Abstract: Summary
New strategies are urgently needed to counter the threat to human health posed by drug-resistant fungi. To explore an as-yet unexploited target space for antifungals, we screened a library of protein kinase inhibitors for the ability to reverse resistance of the most common human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, to caspofungin, a widely used antifungal. This screen identified multiple 2,3-aryl-pyrazolopyridine scaffold compounds capable of restoring caspofungin sensitivity. Using chemical genomic, biochemical, and structural approaches, we established the target for our most potent compound as Yck2, a casein kinase 1 family member. Combination of this compound with caspofungin eradicated drug-resistant C. albicans infection while sparing co-cultured human cells. In mice, genetic depletion of YCK2 caused an ∼3-log10 decline in fungal burden in a model of systemic caspofungin-resistant C. albicans infection. Structural insights and our tool compound's profile in culture support targeting the Yck2 kinase function as a broadly active antifungal strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages encoding anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) must cooperate to overcome phage resistance mediated by the bacterial immune system CRISPR-Cas, where the first phage blocks CRISPR-Cas immunity in order to allow a second Acr phage to successfully replicate. However, in nature, bacteria are frequently not pre-immunized, and phage populations are often not clonal, exhibiting variations in Acr presence and strength. We explored how interactions between Acr phages and initially sensitive bacteria evolve, both in the presence and absence of competing phages lacking Acrs. We find that Acr phages benefit “Acr-negative” phages by limiting the evolution of CRISPR-based resistance and helping Acr-negative phages to replicate on resistant host sub-populations. These benefits depend on the strength of CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and result in strong Acrs providing smaller fitness advantages than weaker ones when Acr phages compete with Acr-negative phages. These results indicate that different Acr types shape the evolutionary dynamics and social interactions of phage populations in natural communities.

Abstract: Summary
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) catalyzes the first step in the ammonia-detoxifying urea cycle, converting ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate under physiologic conditions. In cancer, CPS1 overexpression supports pyrimidine synthesis to promote tumor growth in some cancer types, while in others CPS1 activity prevents the buildup of toxic levels of intratumoral ammonia to allow for sustained tumor growth. Targeted CPS1 inhibitors may, therefore, provide a therapeutic benefit for cancer patients with tumors overexpressing CPS1. Herein, we describe the discovery of small-molecule CPS1 inhibitors that bind to a previously unknown allosteric pocket to block ATP hydrolysis in the first step of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. CPS1 inhibitors are active in cellular assays, blocking both urea synthesis and CPS1 support of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, while having no activity against CPS2. These newly discovered CPS1 inhibitors are a first step toward providing researchers with valuable tools for probing CPS1 cancer biology.

Abstract: Summary
Quorum sensing is a process of chemical communication that bacteria use to track cell density and coordinate gene expression across a population. Bacteria-infecting viruses, called phages, can encode quorum-sensing components that enable them to integrate host cell density information into the lysis-lysogeny decision. Vibriophage VP882 is one such phage, and activation of its quorum-sensing pathway leads to the production of an antirepressor called Qtip. Qtip interferes with the prophage repressor (cIVP882), leading to host-cell lysis. Here, we show that Qtip interacts with the N terminus of cIVP882, inhibiting both cIVP882 DNA binding and cIVP882 autoproteolysis. Qtip also sequesters cIVP882, localizing it to the poles. Qtip can localize to the poles independently of cIVP882. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of Qtip shows that its localization and interference with cIVP882 activities are separable. Comparison of Qtip to a canonical phage antirepressor reveals that despite both proteins interacting with their partner repressors, only Qtip drives polar localization.

Abstract: Tripartite motif 16 (TRIM16) has emerged as a novel oxidative stress-responsive protein that confers cytoprotective effects by reinforcing the cellular antioxidant system. However, whether TRIM16 is involved in regulating oxidative stress during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential function and molecular mechanism of TRIM16 in regulating oxidative stress in neurons induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. Here, we found that OGD/R exposure resulted in a significant induction of TRIM16 expression in neurons. Depletion of TRIM16 by siRNA-mediated gene knockdown markedly upregulated the sensitivity of neurons to OGD/R-induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Notably, upregulation of TRIM16 expression significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced apoptosis and ROS generation in neurons. Moreover, TRIM16 overexpression markedly increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and enhanced Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) activation associated with downregulation of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) expression. Restoration of Keap1 significantly reversed the TRIM16-mediated promotion effect on Nrf2/ARE activation. In addition, knockdown of Nrf2 also markedly abrogated the TRIM16-conferred neuroprotective effect in OGD/R-exposed neurons. Taken together, our results of our study demonstrate that induction of TRIM16 confers a cytoprotective effect in OGD/R-exposed neurons through enhancement of Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling via downregulation of Keap1. These findings suggest that TRIM16 may play a critical role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and serve as a promising target for neuroprotection.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as a novel type of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) of interest in gene regulation, especially for its vital function underlying many diseases. Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrythmia. However, the expression spectrum and function of circRNAs in atrial appendage of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has seldomly been investigated. Human atrial appendage tissues were acquired during cardiac surgery, which were divided into the AF group and the Sinus rhythm (SR) group. The expression characterization of circRNAs of two groups was revealed by high-throughput sequencing. The dysregulated circRNAs were identified and analyzed by bioinformatics methods, and further validated by realtime PCR. A total 18109 circRNAs in human atrial appendage tissues were targeted. Among them, 147 differentially expressed circRNAs (102 up-regulated and 45 down-regulated) were found between AF group and SR group. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that many mRNAs transcribed from the host genes of altered circRNAs were implicated in regulation of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity, as well as nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways. Analysis of the association between differently expressed circRNA and miRNA were explored, which revealed an ample interaction. Our study firstly revealed the expression spectrum of circRNAs in both left and right atrial appendage of patients with or without AF. Differentially expressed circRNAs in the atrial appendage were also identified, analyzed and validated. The results of this study may provide novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for AF.

Abstract: Background
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been implicated in initiation and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Gremlin-1 promotes vascular remodeling of PAH and mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is similar to EndMT. In the present study we investigated the potential role of gremlin-1 plays in EndMT of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs).
Methods
Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Migration and angiogenic responses of PAECs were determined by transwell assay and tube formation assay, respectively. Protein expression levels were determined by western blotting.
Results
Gremlin-1 induced EndMT of PAECs in a phospho-smad2/3–dependent manner. This was characterized by the loss of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 and an increase in protein levels of a-SMA, nerve-cadherin, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. It was also determined that gremlin-1 facilitated the migration and angiogenic responses of PAECs in a dose-dependent manner. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) was found to attenuate gremlin-1-mediated EndMT, migration and angiogenesis of PAECs by inducing phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and suppressing phosphorylation of Smad2/3.
Conclusion
Gremlin-1 mediates EndMT in PAECs, and BMP-7 reverses gremlin-1-induced EndMT by an induction of p-Smad1/5/8 and suppression of p-Smad2/3.

Abstract: Although human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) hold great promises for regenerative medicine, their key biological properties remain poorly understood. In particular, proliferation defects resulted from deep quiescence (dormancy) and senescence represent a major hurdle in hADSC production and clinical application. We have developed a model system for mechanistic dissection of hADSC quiescence and senescence. p57Kip2, a major CDK inhibitor, was highly expressed in quiescent and senescent hADSCs but its level quickly declined upon stem cell activation. p57Kip2 overexpression induced quiescence in spite of proliferative signals and its knockdown promoted cell cycle reentry even with induction of quiescence presumably through modulating the CDK2–CyclinE1 complex. Given its key role in quiescence and senescence, p57Kip2 may be exploited for innovative strategies to amplify hADSCs of high quality for clinics.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation factor-like 4aa (Arl4aa) is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family. It is expressed in hematopoietic tissue during embryonic development, but its function was unknown. Zebrafish arl4aa is preferentially expressed in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VDA) at 24 and 36 hpf and in caudal hematopoietic tissue at 48 hpf. Morpholino knockdown and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) knockout of arl4aa significantly reduced expression of genes associated with definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Golgi complex integrity in VDA was disrupted as shown by transmission electron microscopy and immunostaining of Golgi membrane Giantin. Mechanistically, arl4aa knockdown reduced Notch signaling in the VDA and its target gene expression. Protein expression of NICD was also reduced. Effects of arl4aa knockdown on definitive hematopoiesis could be restored by NICD expression. This study identified arl4aa as a factor regulating initiation of definitive HSCs by maintaining the integrity of Golgi complex and, secondarily, maturation of the Notch receptor.

Abstract: SIRT1 (NAD+-dependent deacetylase) plays a suppressive role during the late stages of adipogenesis. However, the effects of SIRT1 on the early phases of adipogenic differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are poorly understood. We employed Sirt1+/+ and Sirt1–/– mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to evaluate the role of SIRT1 during the early stage mESC differentiation to adipocytes in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Treatment with EX527 (a SIRT1 inhibitor) during the early phase and SIRT1 knockout both significantly diminished differentiation to mature adipocytes. Expressions of marker genes of preadipocytes, brown adipocytes, and brite cells were significantly lower in Sirt1–/– mESCs than in Sirt1+/+ mESCs. Furthermore, SIRT1 knockout reduced RA-induced RA receptor (RAR)α and RARβ mRNA and protein expressions during early adipocyte differentiation. Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1), a negative regulator of RAR signaling, expression, and acetylation levels were higher in Sirt1–/– than in Sirt1+/+ mESCs. After RA treatment, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using an antibody against NCOR1, revealed that NCOR1 binding to RARβ promoters was significantly lower in Sirt1–/– mESCs than in Sirt1+/+ mESCs, and luciferase reporter assays showed SIRT1 knockdown decreased RA-induced RARα activity. Taken together, these observations show SIRT1 is required during the early phase of mESC adipogenesis and that SIRT1 deficiency inhibits adipogenesis by increasing NCOR1 acetylation and down-regulating the expressions of RARα and RARβ.

Abstract: Sogatella furcifera (Horváth), a prominent rice pest in Asia, is a typical R-strategic and highly adaptable insect. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are highly conserved molecular chaperones regulating responses to various abiotic stresses; however, limited information is available regarding their role in responding to abiotic stress in S. furcifera. This study aimed to investigate the effect of abiotic stresses on the expression of Hsp70 genes in the S. furcifera. Five Hsp70 genes were isolated from S. furcifera, and the expression patterns at different developmental stages and temperatures, upon treatment with different insecticides and ultraviolet A (UV-A) stress, were analyzed. Hsp70 genes were expressed at different developmental stages. Hsp70-2, Hsp70-5, and Hsp70-6 were significantly upregulated upon heat shock at 40°C for 30 min. Hsp70-3 and Hsp70-4 were significantly upregulated upon heat shock at 30°C for 30 min. Under UV-A stress, Hsp70-3, Hsp70-4, Hsp70-5, and Hsp70-6 were significantly upregulated. Conversely, Hsp70-2 was significantly downregulated under UV-A stress. The five Hsp70 genes were significantly downregulated in 3rd-instar nymphs on exposure to thiamethoxam, buprofezin, and avermectin at LC10 and LC25 concentrations. Hence, Hsp70 genes significantly contribute to the tolerance of S. furcifera to temperature and UV-A stress; however, they are not involved in the response to insecticides.

Abstract: Pevonedistat is a potent, selective, first-in-class NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor. It is now under multiple clinical trials that investigate its anticancer effect against solid tumors and leukemia. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins that are involved in mediating multidrug resistance (MDR). In this article, we reveal that pevonedistat is a substrate of ABCG2 which decreases the therapeutic effect of pevonedistat. The cytotoxicity of pevonedistat was significantly weakened in ABCG2-overexpressing cells, and the drug resistance can be reversed by ABCG2 inhibitors. The ATPase assay suggested that pevonedistat can stimulate ABCG2 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Pevonedistat showed little effect on the expression level or subcellular localization of ABCG2 after 72 h treatment. Furthermore, a pevonedistat resistance cell line S1-PR was established and overexpressed ABCG2. Generally, our study provides evidence that ABCG2 can be a prominent factor leading to pevonedistat-resistance. Furthermore, ABCG2 may also be utilized as a biomarker to monitor the development of pevonedistat resistance during cancer treatment.

Abstract: Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a metabolic nuclear receptor, which protects liver from many endogenous and exogenous injuries. Metallothioneins (MTs) belong to a low-molecular-weight protein family involved in metal homeostasis and the regulation of hepatic oxidative stress. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of FXR on hepatic MT1 expression and the underlying mechanism. C57BL/6 mice or primary cultured mouse hepatocytes were treated with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 or natural ligand CDCA. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed to identify gene expression profile in the livers of mice treated with GW4064. Real-time PCR and Western blot were applied to determine the expression of MT1 and other FXR target genes in the livers of mice and primary hepatocytes treated with GW4064 and CDCA. Cellular and subcellular locations of MT1 in the livers of mice treated with GW4064 were examined using immunohistochemistry assay. FXR small interfering RNAs (siRNA) was transfected to silence FXR. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were utilized to confirm the regulation of MT1 gene promoter activity by FXR. RNA-seq analysis revealed that GW4064 treatment significantly induced MT1 expression in mouse liver. Consistently, MT1 expression in the hepatocytes of mouse livers and cultured hepatocytes was upregulated by GW4064 as well as CDCA. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of FXR markedly increased, while siRNA-mediated FXR silencing significantly suppressed MT1 expression in cultured hepatocytes. Luciferase reporter and ChIP assays further confirmed that the MT1 gene was under the direct control of FXR. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MT1 is a novel target gene of FXR and may contribute to antioxidative capacity of FXR in liver diseases.

Arg kinase mediates CXCL12/CXCR4-induced invadopodia formation and invasion of glioma cells,

Abstract: Compared with noninvasive tumor cells, glioma cells overexpress chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), which exhibits significantly greater expression in invasive tumor cells than in noninvasive tumor cells. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12, also known as stromal derived factor-1, SDF-1) and its cell surface receptor CXCR4 activate a signaling axis that induces the expression of membrane type-2 matrix metalloproteinase (MT2-MMP), which plays a pivotal role in the invasion and migration of various cancer cells; however, the specific mechanism involved in this is unclear. Recently, studies have shown that invadopodia can recruit and secrete related enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), to degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), promoting the invasion and migration of tumor cells. Phosphorylated cortactin (pY421-cortactin) is required for the formation and maturation of invadopodia, but the upstream regulatory factors and kinases involved in phosphorylation have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that CXCL12/CXCR4 was capable of inducing glioma cell invadopodia formation, probably by regulating cortactin phosphorylation. The interaction of cortactin and Arg (also known as Abl-related nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, ABL2) in glioma cells was demonstrated. The silencing of Arg inhibited glioma cell invadopodia formation and invasion by blocking cortactin phosphorylation. Moreover, CXCL12 could not induce glioma cell invasion in Arg-knockdown glioma cells. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Arg mediates CXCL12/CXCR4-induced glioma cell invasion, and CXCL12/CXCR4 regulates invadopodia maturation through the Arg-cortactin pathway, which indicates that Arg could be a candidate therapeutic target to inhibit glioma cell invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of a healthy photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) interface is essential for vision. At the center of this interface, apical membrane protrusions stemming from the RPE ensheath photoreceptor outer segments (POS), and are possibly involved in the recycling of POS through phagocytosis. The molecules that regulate POS ensheathment and its relationship to phagocytosis remain to be deciphered. By means of ultrastructural analysis, we revealed that Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) ligands, GAS6 and PROS1, rather than αVβ5 integrin receptor ligands, triggered POS ensheathment by human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived RPE. Furthermore, we found that ensheathment is required for POS fragmentation before internalization. Consistently, POS ensheathment, fragmentation, and internalization were abolished in MERTK mutant RPE, and rescue of MERTK expression in retinitis pigmentosa (RP38) patient RPE counteracted these defects. Our results suggest that loss of ensheathment due to MERTK dysfunction might contribute to vision impairment in RP38 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Yes-associated protein (YAP) is known to promote the stemness of multiple stem cell types, including pluripotent stem cells, while also antagonizing pluripotency during early embryogenesis. How YAP accomplishes these distinct functions remains unclear. Here, we report that, depending on the specific cells in which it is expressed, YAP could exhibit opposing effects on pluripotency induction from mouse somatic cells. Specifically, YAP inhibits pluripotency induction cell-autonomously but promotes it non-cell-autonomously. For its non-cell-autonomous role, YAP alters the expression of many secreted and matricellular proteins, including CYR61. YAP's non-cell-autonomous promoting effect could be recapitulated by recombinant CYR61 and abrogated by CYR61 depletion. Thus, we define a YAP-driven effect on enhancing pluripotency induction largely mediated by CYR61. Our work highlights the importance of considering the distinct contributions from heterologous cell types in deciphering cell fate control mechanisms and calls for careful re-examination of the co-existing bystander cells in complex cultures and tissues.

Abstract: Stress-induced gastric ulcer is one of the common complications affecting patients after trauma, mainly leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation, and severe cases may be life-threatening. However, the molecular mechanism of stress-induced gastric ulcer remains unclear. In the present study, RNA-sequencing was performed on gastric tissues of normal rats (C), stress-induced gastric ulcer rats (T0), and rats recovered from gastric ulcer for 3 days (T3), and bioinformatics analysis was performed to determine changes in gene expression and biological pathways. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were constructed by STRING and visualized by the Cytoscape software. The associated transcriptional factor (TFs)–gene regulatory network of the hub DEGs was also constructed. Pairwise comparisons obtained 103 (T0_C), 127 (T3_T0), and 13 (T3_C) DEGs, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated DEGs in T0_C and T3_T0 were significantly enriched in response to oxygen-containing compound, response to organic substance, and response to external stimulus. Pathway analysis suggested that DEGs were enriched in TNF signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, apoptosis, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Seven hub genes (Fos, Jun, Nfkbia, Dusp1, Pim3, Junb, and Fosb) were obtained from the PPI networks of T0_C and T3_T0. Key TFs with close interactions, such as Fos, Jun, Nfkbia, Junb, Egr1, and Fosb, were screened This study used RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to screen out genes associated with gastric ulcer, which can help reveal the molecular mechanism of gastric ulcer development and restoration, and provide reference for the treatment of human gastric ulcers.

Abstract: Background
The protein plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), an inhibitor specific for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has been shown to have a key role in cancer metastases. Currently, it is unknown as to whether the exocellular inhibition of PAI-1 can inhibit the migration of cancer cells.
Methods
By fusing the mutated serine protease domain (SPD) of uPA and human serum albumin (HSA), PAItrap3, a protein that traps PAI-1, was synthesized and experiments were conducted to determine if exocellular PAItrap3 attenuates PAI-1-induced cancer cell migration in vitro.
Results
PAItrap3 (0.8 μM) significantly inhibited the motility of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HeLa and 4T1 cancer cells, by 90%, 50%, 30% and 20%, respectively, without significantly altering their proliferation. The PAI-1-induced rearrangement of F-actin was significantly inhibited by PAItrap3, which produced a decrease in the number of cell protrusions by at least 20%.
Conclusions
In vitro, PAItrap3 inhibited PAI-1-induced cancer cell migration, mainly through inhibiting the rearrangement of F-actin. Overall, these results, provided they can be extrapolated to humans, suggest that the PAItrap3 protein could be used as an exocellular inhibitor to attenuate cancer metastases.

Abstract: Summary
We previously discovered in mouse adipocytes an lncRNA (the homolog of human LINC00116) regulating adipogenesis that contains a highly conserved coding region. Here, we show human protein expression of a peptide within LINC00116, and demonstrate that this peptide modulates triglyceride clearance in human adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and mitochondrial β-oxidation. This gene has previously been identified as mitoregulin (MTLN). We conclude that MTLN has a regulatory role in adipocyte metabolism as demonstrated by systemic lipid phenotypes in knockout mice. We also assert its adipocyte-autonomous phenotypes in both isolated murine adipocytes as well as human stem cell-derived adipocytes. MTLN directly interacts with the β subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme critical in the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Our human and murine models contend that MTLN could be an avenue for further therapeutic research, albeit not without caveats, for example, by promoting white adipocyte triglyceride clearance in obese subjects.

Abstract: N-alpha-acetyltransferase 80 (NAA80) was recently demonstrated to acetylate the N-terminus of actin, with NAA80 knockout cells showing actin cytoskeleton-related phenotypes, such as increased formation of membrane protrusions and accelerated migration. Here we report that NAA80 knockout cells additionally display fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. We further employed rescue assays to demonstrate that this phenotype is connected to the ability of NAA80 to modify actin. Thus, re-expression of NAA80, which leads to re-establishment of actin's N-terminal acetyl group, rescued the Golgi fragmentation, whereas a catalytic dead NAA80 mutant could neither restore actin Nt-acetylation nor Golgi structure. The Golgi phenotype of NAA80 KO cells was shared by both migrating and non-migrating cells and live-cell imaging indicated increased Golgi dynamics in migrating NAA80 KO cells. Finally, we detected a drastic increase in the amount of F-actin in cells lacking NAA80, suggesting a causal relationship between this effect and the observed re-organization of Golgi structure. The findings further underscore the importance of actin Nt-acetylation and provide novel insight into its cellular roles, suggesting a mechanistic link between actin modification state and Golgi organization.

Abstract: MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) overexpressed in many tumor types, which makes it an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However, this marker is a non-mutated antigen without high immunogenicity. In this study, we designed several new altered peptides by replacing amino acids in their sequences, which were derived from a low-affinity MUC1 peptide, thus bypassing immune tolerance. Compared to the wild-type (WT) peptide, the altered MUC1 peptides (MUC11081-1089L2, MUC11156-1164L2, MUC11068-1076Y1) showed higher affinity to the HLA-A0201 molecule and stronger immunogenicity. Furthermore, these altered peptides resulted in the generation of more cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that could cross-recognize gastric cancer cells expressing WT MUC1 peptides, in an HLA-A0201-restricted manner. In addition, M1.1 (MUC1950-958), a promising antitumor peptide that has been tested in multiple tumors, was not able to induce stronger antitumor responses. Collectively, our results demonstrated that altered peptides from MUC1, as potential HLA-A0201-restricted CTL epitopes, could serve as peptide vaccines or constitute components of peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccines for gastric cancer treatment.

Abstract: Podocyte injury leads to impaired filtration barrier function of the kidney that underlies the pathophysiology of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), the most common NS occurring in children. The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is involved in the regulation of apoptosis in a variety of cell types, however, little is known about its role in podocytes and whether it associated with NS. Here, we show that Hsp90 is upregulated in glomeruli podocytes from mice with adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy, and that it is also upregulated in an immortalized podocyte cell line treated with ADR in vitro, together suggesting an association of Hsp90 upregulation in podocytes with NS pathogenesis. Functionally, Hsp90 inhibition with PU-H71 aggravates ADR-induced podocyte apoptosis and worsens the impairment of filtration barrier function. Mechanistically, Hsp90 inhibition with PU-H71 enhances the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and moreover, blockade of podocyte apoptosis with zVAD-fmk (aVAD), a pan-caspase inhibitor, abrogates effects of Hsp90 inhibition on filtration barrier function of ADR-treated podocytes, thus demonstrating that Hsp90 inhibition aggravates ADR-induced podocyte injury through intrinsic apoptosis pathway. In sum, this study reveals a detrimental role of Hsp90 inhibition in podocyte injury, which may offer it as a potential therapeutic target in NS therapy.

Abstract: Vitiligo is a chronic, autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, resulting in progressively expanding depigmented skin patches. Severity of the disorder, which affects approximately 1% of humans, may be mitigated using topical corticosteroids combined with phototherapy; along with other clinical strategies; however, no definitive cures are currently available. Here, the capacity of apigenin, a plant-derived aglycone, to inhibit oxidative stress–mediated melanocyte depletion in vitro using a PIG3V vitiligo perilesional melanocyte cell model is evaluated. PIG3V cells, treated with selected doses of apigenin, were challenged with H2O2, then assessed for viability and the oxidative stress–related parameters: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and downstream targets was detected using Western blotting. Outcomes demonstrated that compared with negative control cultures, apigenin-treated cells exhibited enhanced viability. Likewise, apigenin enhanced expression of the cellular anti-oxidants SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px, but inhibited production of MDA, an oxidative stress biomarker. Interestingly, the expression and nuclear localization of the Nrf2 transcription factor, an important regulator oxidative stress and its downstream target genes, was significantly increased by apigenin treatment. Apigenin influence on Nrf2 was further validated by experiments demonstrating that Nrf2 knockdown cells failed to exhibit significant apigenin-mediated effects on cell viability and oxidative stress. Apigenin’s non-toxicity and ability to affect multiple oxidative stress–related parameters through its effects on Nrf2 signaling in melanocytes suggests that it may prove to be a valuable therapeutic tool in long-term management of vitiligo.

Abstract: The lack of available, well characterized, established, domestic porcine cell lines hinders the advancement of porcine cellular immunology. A case of multicentric lymphoma was diagnosed in a market weight pig at the time of slaughter. Affected lymph nodes and spleen were collected and used for single cell isolation and analysis. Cell lines were established by 3 rounds of limiting dilution from splenic and subiliac lymph node lymphomas. Surface marker staining identified the cells as CD21+, CD79a+, CD20+, PAX5+, and CD3− and cells were grown and easily passaged in cell culture. Transcriptome analysis was carried out to further characterize these rapidly proliferating cells validating the initial cytometric findings, confirming their identity as B cell lymphomas, and suggesting that they arose from germinal center centroblasts with aberrant control of BCL6 expression. Functional analysis identified the cells as being involved in cancer, cell movement, cell survival, and apoptosis. These new porcine B cell lymphoma cell lines will be a valuable resource for more in-depth cellular investigations into the porcine immune system and cancer, as well as providing a potential tool for the growth of lymphotropic viruses of pigs and humans.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken to investigate genetic variability in a fragment comprising 5′UTR along with partial coding sequence of Hsp70 gene and its association with thermotolerance traits in Murrah buffalo at ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna (India). The allelic variants were identified from genomic DNA samples using SSCP technique. The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. Data on different thermotolerance traits recorded in three seasons were analyzed by least squares ANOVA taking the SSCP genotypes as fixed effect. Two allelic variants (A and B), each of 503-bp in size, were documented with frequency of 0.59 and 0.41, respectively, and three genotypes (AA, AB and BB) with corresponding frequency of 0.30, 0.58 and 0.12. The allelic variants were due to single nucleotide substitution at 55th base position leading to a change of threonine (A) to methionine (B) in amino acid sequence. Both the allelic variants had 99.8% similarity in nucleotide sequence. In phylogenetic tree, allele A was in a cluster while allele B and Gangatiri cattle sequence formed a different cluster. The SSCP genotypes had significant effect on different thermotolerance traits in summer with thermo-humidity index of ≥ 84. Buffaloes with AA genotype had the highest (P ˂ 0.05) summer evening rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate, inferring that the buffaloes carrying AA genotype had more stress in summer than those with AB and BB genotype. These SSCP genotypes might have differential role in heat shock protein response to induce thermotolerance of Murrah buffaloes in Gangetic plains.

Abstract: Although primary cilia abnormalities have been frequently observed in multiple cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa), the molecular mechanisms underlying primary ciliogenesis repression in PCa cells remain unclear. Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein-3 (TACC3), whose deregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer, is a key centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in centrosome/microtubule dynamics, potentially impacting primary cilium generation. Here, we showed that TACC3 was markedly upregulated in PCa and that knockdown of TACC3 restrained tumorigenesis and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we found that TACC3 interacts with filamin A, and elevated levels of TACC3 disrupted the interaction between filamin A and meckelin, thereby restraining primary cilium formation in PCa cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis immune receptors RPS4 and RRS1 interact to co-confer responsiveness to bacterial effectors. The RRS1-R allele, with RPS4, responds to AvrRps4 and PopP2, whereas RRS1-S responds only to AvrRps4. Here, we show that the C terminus of RRS1-R but not RRS1-S is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation at Thr1214 in the WRKY domain maintains RRS1-R in its inactive state and also inhibits acetylation of RRS1-R by PopP2. PopP2 in turn catalyzes O-acetylation at the same site, thereby preventing its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at other sites is required for PopP2 but not AvrRps4 responsiveness and facilitates the interaction of RRS1’s C terminus with its TIR domain. Derepression of RRS1-R or RRS1-S involves effector-triggered proximity between their TIR domain and C termini. This effector-promoted interaction between these domains relieves inhibition of TIRRPS4 by TIRRRS1. Our data reveal effector-triggered and phosphorylation-regulated conformational changes within RRS1 that results in distinct modes of derepression of the complex by PopP2 and AvrRps4.
