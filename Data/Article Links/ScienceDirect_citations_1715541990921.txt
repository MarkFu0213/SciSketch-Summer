Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway by monoclonal antibodies (Abs) has shown promising clinical benefit in the treatment of multiple cancer types. We elucidated the contribution of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-ligand 1 (L1) Abs for their optimal anti-tumor activity. We revealed that distinct Fcγ receptor (FcγRs) dependency and mechanisms account for the in vivo activity of anti-PD-1 versus anti-PD-L1 Abs. Anti-PD-1 Abs were found to be FcγR independent in vivo; the presence of FcγR-binding capacity compromises their anti-tumor activity. In contrast, the anti-PD-L1 Abs show augmented anti-tumor activity when activating FcγR binding is introduced into the molecules, altering myeloid subsets within the tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
In many animals, the germ plasm segregates germline from soma during early development. Oskar protein is known for its ability to induce germ plasm formation and germ cells in Drosophila. However, the molecular basis of germ plasm formation remains unclear. Here, we show that Oskar is an RNA-binding protein in vivo, crosslinking to nanos, polar granule component, and germ cell-less mRNAs, each of which has a role in germline formation. Furthermore, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the two Oskar domains. RNA-binding maps in vitro to the C-terminal domain, which shows structural similarity to SGNH hydrolases. The highly conserved N-terminal LOTUS domain forms dimers and mediates Oskar interaction with the germline-specific RNA helicase Vasa in vitro. Our findings suggest a dual function of Oskar in RNA and Vasa binding, providing molecular clues to its germ plasm function.

Abstract: Summary
Calcitonin receptor (Calcr) is expressed in adult muscle stem cells (muscle satellite cells [MuSCs]). To elucidate the role of Calcr, we conditionally depleted Calcr from adult MuSCs and found that impaired regeneration after muscle injury correlated with the decreased number of MuSCs in Calcr-conditional knockout (cKO) mice. Calcr signaling maintained MuSC dormancy via the cAMP-PKA pathway but had no impact on myogenic differentiation of MuSCs in an undifferentiated state. The abnormal quiescent state in Calcr-cKO mice resulted in a reduction of the MuSC pool by apoptosis. Furthermore, MuSCs were found outside their niche in Calcr-cKO mice, demonstrating cell relocation. This emergence from the sublaminar niche was prevented by the Calcr-cAMP-PKA and Calcr-cAMP-Epac pathways downstream of Calcr. Altogether, the findings demonstrated that Calcr exerts its effect specifically by keeping MuSCs in a quiescent state and in their location, maintaining the MuSC pool.

Abstract: Summary
Myelin is essential in vertebrates for the rapid propagation of action potentials, but the molecular mechanisms driving its formation remain largely unknown. Here we show that the initial stage of process extension and axon ensheathment by oligodendrocytes requires dynamic actin filament assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. Unexpectedly, subsequent myelin wrapping coincides with the upregulation of actin disassembly proteins and rapid disassembly of the oligodendrocyte actin cytoskeleton and does not require Arp2/3. Inducing loss of actin filaments drives oligodendrocyte membrane spreading and myelin wrapping in vivo, and the actin disassembly factor gelsolin is required for normal wrapping. We show that myelin basic protein, a protein essential for CNS myelin wrapping whose role has been unclear, is required for actin disassembly, and its loss phenocopies loss of actin disassembly proteins. Together, these findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism of myelin wrapping and identify it as an actin-independent form of mammalian cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
The amount and distribution of dystrophin protein in myofibers and muscle is highly variable in Becker muscular dystrophy and in exon-skipping trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we investigate a molecular basis for this variability. In muscle from Becker patients sharing the same exon 45–47 in-frame deletion, dystrophin levels negatively correlate with microRNAs predicted to target dystrophin. Seven microRNAs inhibit dystrophin expression in vitro, and three are validated in vivo (miR-146b/miR-374a/miR-31). microRNAs are expressed in dystrophic myofibers and increase with age and disease severity. In exon-skipping-treated mdx mice, microRNAs are significantly higher in muscles with low dystrophin rescue. TNF-α increases microRNA levels in vitro whereas NFκB inhibition blocks this in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data show that microRNAs contribute to variable dystrophin levels in muscular dystrophy. Our findings suggest a model where chronic inflammation in distinct microenvironments induces pathological microRNAs, initiating a self-sustaining feedback loop that exacerbates disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have emerged as a gene-delivery platform with demonstrated safety and efficacy in a handful of clinical trials for monogenic disorders. However, limitations of the current generation vectors often prevent broader application of AAV gene therapy. Efforts to engineer AAV vectors have been hampered by a limited understanding of the structure-function relationship of the complex multimeric icosahedral architecture of the particle. To develop additional reagents pertinent to further our insight into AAVs, we inferred evolutionary intermediates of the viral capsid using ancestral sequence reconstruction. In-silico-derived sequences were synthesized de novo and characterized for biological properties relevant to clinical applications. This effort led to the generation of nine functional putative ancestral AAVs and the identification of Anc80, the predicted ancestor of the widely studied AAV serotypes 1, 2, 8, and 9, as a highly potent in vivo gene therapy vector for targeting liver, muscle, and retina.

Abstract: Summary
LMTK3 is an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, lung, gastric, and colorectal cancer. It is localized in different cellular compartments, but its nuclear function has not been investigated so far. We mapped LMTK3 binding across the genome using ChIP-seq and found that LMTK3 binding events are correlated with repressive chromatin markers. We further identified KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) as a binding partner of LMTK3. The LMTK3/KAP1 interaction is stabilized by PP1α, which suppresses KAP1 phosphorylation specifically at LMTK3-associated chromatin regions, inducing chromatin condensation and resulting in transcriptional repression of LMTK3-bound tumor suppressor-like genes. Furthermore, LMTK3 functions at distal regions in tethering the chromatin to the nuclear periphery, resulting in H3K9me3 modification and gene silencing. In summary, we propose a model where a scaffolding function of nuclear LMTK3 promotes cancer progression through chromatin remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Altering the balance between energy intake and expenditure is a potential strategy for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, despite years of progress in identifying diverse molecular targets, biological-based therapies are limited. Here we demonstrate that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) regulates energy expenditure through activation of a PGC1α-dependent metabolic program in adipose tissues and muscle. Genetic modulation of HSF1 levels altered white fat remodeling and thermogenesis, and pharmacological activation of HSF1 via celastrol was associated with enhanced energy expenditure, increased mitochondrial function in fat and muscle and protection against obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis during high-fat diet regimens. The beneficial metabolic changes elicited by celastrol were abrogated in HSF1 knockout mice. Overall, our findings identify the temperature sensor HSF1 as a regulator of energy metabolism and demonstrate that augmenting HSF1 via celastrol represents a possible therapeutic strategy to treat obesity and its myriad metabolic consequences.

Abstract: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 5% of children. However, the neural mechanisms underlying its development and treatment are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we report that an ADHD mouse model, which harbors a deletion in the Git1 locus, exhibits severe astrocytosis in the globus pallidus (GP) and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which send modulatory GABAergic inputs to the thalamus. A moderate level of astrocytosis was displayed in other regions of the basal ganglia pathway, including the ventrobasal thalamus and cortex, but not in other brain regions, such as the caudate putamen, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampal CA1. This basal ganglia circuit-selective astrocytosis was detected in both in adult (2–3 months old) and juvenile (4 weeks old) Git1−/− mice, suggesting a developmental origin. Astrocytes play an active role in the developing synaptic circuit; therefore, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of synaptic markers. We detected increased and decreased levels of GABA and parvalbumin (PV), respectively, in the GP. This suggests that astrocytosis may alter synaptic transmission in the basal ganglia. Intriguingly, increased GABA expression colocalized with the astrocyte marker, GFAP, indicative of an astrocytic origin. Collectively, these results suggest that defects in basal ganglia circuitry, leading to impaired inhibitory modulation of the thalamus, are neural correlates for the ADHD-associated behavioral manifestations in Git1−/− mice.

Abstract: Macrophages are divided into two subpopulations: classically activated macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2). BCG (Bacilli Calmette-Guérin) activates disabled naïve macrophages to M1 macrophages, which act as inflammatory, microbicidal and tumoricidal cells through cell-cell contact and/or the release of soluble factors. Various transcription factors and signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of macrophage activation and polarization. We discovered that BCG-activated macrophages (BAM) expressed a new molecule, and we named it Novel Macrophage Activated Associated Protein 1 (NMAAP1). The current study found that the overexpression of NMAAP1 in macrophages results in M1 polarization with increased expression levels of M1 genes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 12 (IL-12), Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and decreased expression of some M2 genes, such as Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), but not other M2 genes, including arginase-1 (Arg-1), Interleukin (IL-10), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and found in inflammatory zone 1 (Fizz1). Moreover, NMAAP1 overexpression in the RAW264.7 cell line increased cytotoxicity against MCA207 tumor cells, which depends on increased inflammatory cytokines rather than cell-cell contact. NMAAP1 also substantially enhanced the phagocytic ability of macrophages, which implies that NMAAP1 promoted macrophage adhesive and clearance activities. Our results indicate that NMAAP1 is an essential molecule that modulates macrophages phenotype and plays an important role in macrophage tumoricidal functions.

Abstract: Summary
The mouse cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) is a translational regulator implicated in long-term memory maintenance. Invertebrate orthologs of CPEB3 in Aplysia and Drosophila are functional prions that are physiologically active in the aggregated state. To determine if this principle applies to the mammalian CPEB3, we expressed it in yeast and found that it forms heritable aggregates that are the hallmark of known prions. In addition, we confirm in the mouse the importance of CPEB3’s prion formation for CPEB3 function. Interestingly, deletion analysis of the CPEB3 prion domain uncovered a tripartite organization: two aggregation-promoting domains surround a regulatory module that affects interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. In all, our data provide direct evidence that CPEB3 is a functional prion in the mammalian brain and underline the potential importance of an actin/CPEB3 feedback loop for the synaptic plasticity underlying the persistence of long-term memory.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family of RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases promote innate immune responses by catalyzing synthesis of polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63). Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the TRIM5α retroviral restriction factor activates Ubc13, the K63-linkage-specific E2. Structural, biochemical, and functional characterization of the TRIM5α:Ubc13-Ub interactions reveals that activation of the Ubc13-Ub conjugate requires dimerization of the TRIM5α RING domain. Our data explain how higher-order oligomerization of TRIM5α, which is promoted by the interaction with the retroviral capsid, enhances the E3 Ub ligase activity of TRIM5α and contributes to its antiretroviral function. This E3 mechanism, in which RING dimerization is transient and depends on the interaction of the TRIM protein with the ligand, is likely to be conserved in many members of the TRIM family and may have evolved to facilitate recognition of repetitive epitope patterns associated with infection.

Abstract: Disk-degeneration is believed a major cause for lumbar pain. Previously, potential stem cell niches in the intervertebral disk (IVD) region, located adjacent to epiphyseal plate, was reported. The aim of the study was to examine migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture in a potential cellular migration route (CMR; area located between the niche and IVD) and in the IVD in non-degenerated lapine- and in human degenerated IVD tissues. Human MSCs (n=3), human degenerated IVD tissues (n=10) and lapine IVDs (n=10) were collected. The samples were examined by immunohistochemistry for stem cell markers; CD90, OCT3/4, pre-chondrocytic marker; GDF5, catabolic markers; MMP9, MMP13, inflammatory marker; IL1R, cellular migration markers; SNAI1, SNAI2, adhesion markers; β1-INTEGRIN and DDR2. In addition, gene-expression analyses (Real time PCR) were performed on additional samples. Further, time lapse studies were performed with hMSCs cultured on aligned COLL-I-fibers-coated glass-slides in DMEM-LG, 10% human serum containing fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Presence of stem cells (CD90+, OCT3/4+), pre-chondocytic cells (GDF5+) and cells positive for migration markers (SNAI1+, SNAI2+), catabolic markers (MMP9+, MMP13+), inflammatory marker (IL1R+), adhesion markers (DDR2+, B1-INTEGRIN+) were detected (gene- and protein level) in investigated CMR and IVD regions. In the time lapse studies, MSCs alignment and protrusions were observed orientated in the same direction as collagen fibers. Results display influence of ECM collagen architecture and collagen fiber spatial direction on migration of stem cells. The results can be useful when developing tissue-engineering strategies for disk-degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations of the Janus family kinase JAK3 gene cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). JAK3 deficiency in humans is characterized by the absence of circulating T cells and natural killer (NK) cells with normal numbers of poorly functioning B cells (T–B+NK–). Using SCID patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and a T cell in vitro differentiation system, we demonstrate a complete block in early T cell development of JAK3-deficient cells. Correction of the JAK3 mutation by CRISPR/Cas9-enhanced gene targeting restores normal T cell development, including the production of mature T cell populations with a broad T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Whole-genome sequencing of corrected cells demonstrates no CRISPR/Cas9 off-target modifications. These studies describe an approach for the study of human lymphopoiesis and provide a foundation for gene correction therapy in humans with immunodeficiencies.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate distinct, yet overlapping sets of signaling molecules, leading to inflammatory responses to pathogens. Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, present in all TLRs and TLR adapters, mediate protein interactions downstream of activated TLRs. A peptide library derived from TLR2 TIR was screened for inhibition of TLR2 signaling. Cell-permeable peptides derived from the D helix and the segment immediately N-terminal to the TLR2 TIR domain potently inhibited TLR2-mediated cytokine production. The D-helix peptide, 2R9, also potently inhibited TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9, but not TLR3 or TNF-α signaling. Cell imaging, co-immunoprecipitation, and in vitro studies demonstrated that 2R9 preferentially targets TIRAP. 2R9 diminished systemic cytokine responses elicited in vivo by synthetic TLR2 and TLR7 agonists; it inhibited the activation of macrophages infected with influenza strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) and significantly improved the survival of PR8-infected mice. Thus, 2R9 represents a TLR-targeting agent that blocks protein interactions downstream of activated TLRs.

Abstract: Summary
Although clinically tested JAK inhibitors reduce splenomegaly and systemic symptoms, molecular responses are not observed in most myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. We previously demonstrated that MPN cells become persistent to type I JAK inhibitors that bind the active conformation of JAK2. We investigated whether CHZ868, a type II JAK inhibitor, would demonstrate activity in JAK inhibitor persistent cells, murine MPN models, and MPN patient samples. JAK2 and MPL mutant cell lines were sensitive to CHZ868, including type I JAK inhibitor persistent cells. CHZ868 showed significant activity in murine MPN models and induced reductions in mutant allele burden not observed with type I JAK inhibitors. These data demonstrate that type II JAK inhibition is a viable therapeutic approach for MPN patients.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can form neuroectoderm (NE), providing a platform for in vitro dissection of NE formation. However, human ESCs can differentiate into all three germ layers. It thus is crucial to develop efficient methods for differentiation of human ESCs into NE cells. Both plating cell density and localized cell density (LCD) affect NE differentiation. Here, we developed a cell cluster-based NE differentiation method, in which both plating cell density and LCD are under control. Using our new method, high plating cell densities promote expression of PAX6, a NE marker protein. Two SMAD signaling blockers, SB431542 and NOGGIN, downregulate OCT4 and upregulate PAX6, while does not affect mRNA expression of GATA2 after 5 d of differentiation. Moreover, IB analysis showed a time-dependent upregulation of PAX6 and beta-III-tubulin together with a downregulation of OCT4 during the neural differentiation. Coexpression of both TH and beta-III-tubulin in the H9-derived cells was also detected, proving the NE cells have an ability to differentiate into one of the specific neurons. Together, we established a simple method for generating NE cells from H9 cells, which might contribute to develop high efficient method for neural differentiation.

Mutations in inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E) have been associated with ciliary dysfunction; however, its role in regulating ciliary phosphoinositides is unknown. Here we report that in neural stem cells, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is found in high levels in cilia whereas phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is not detectable. Upon INPP5E inactivation, PI(4,5)P2 accumulates at the ciliary tip whereas PI4P is depleted. This is accompanied by recruitment of the PI(4,5)P2-interacting protein TULP3 to the ciliary membrane, along with Gpr161. This results in an increased production of cAMP and a repression of the Shh transcription gene Gli1. Our results reveal the link between ciliary regulation of phosphoinositides by INPP5E and Shh regulation via ciliary trafficking of TULP3/Gpr161 and also provide mechanistic insight into ciliary alterations found in Joubert and MORM syndromes resulting from INPP5E mutations.

Abstract: Summary
In Drosophila ovarian germ cells, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) direct Aubergine and Argonaute3 to cleave transposon transcripts and instruct Piwi to repress transposon transcription, thereby safeguarding the germline genome. Here, we report that RNA cleavage by Argonaute3 initiates production of most Piwi-bound piRNAs. We find that the cardinal function of Argonaute3, whose piRNA guides predominantly correspond to sense transposon sequences, is to produce antisense piRNAs that direct transcriptional silencing by Piwi, rather than to make piRNAs that guide post-transcriptional silencing by Aubergine. We also find that the Tudor domain protein Qin prevents Aubergine’s cleavage products from becoming Piwi-bound piRNAs, ensuring that antisense piRNAs guide Piwi. Although Argonaute3 slicing is required to efficiently trigger phased piRNA production, an alternative, slicing-independent pathway suffices to generate Piwi-bound piRNAs that repress transcription of a subset of transposon families. This alternative pathway may help flies silence newly acquired transposons for which they lack extensively complementary piRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence is a conserved cell-cycle state characterized by cell-cycle arrest, increased stress resistance, enhanced longevity, and decreased transcriptional, translational, and metabolic output. Although quiescence plays essential roles in cell survival and normal differentiation, the molecular mechanisms leading to this state are not well understood. Here, we determined changes in the transcriptome and chromatin structure of S. cerevisiae upon quiescence entry. Our analyses revealed transcriptional shutoff that is far more robust than previously believed and an unprecedented global chromatin transition, which are tightly correlated. These changes require Rpd3 lysine deacetylase targeting to at least half of gene promoters via quiescence-specific transcription factors including Xbp1 and Stb3. Deletion of RPD3 prevents cells from establishing transcriptional quiescence, leading to defects in quiescence entry and shortening of chronological lifespan. Our results define a molecular mechanism for global reprogramming of transcriptome and chromatin structure for quiescence driven by a highly conserved chromatin regulator.

Abstract: Summary
The health of neurons is critically dependent on the relative signaling intensities of survival-promoting synaptic and death-inducing extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Here, we show that BDNF is a regulator of this balance and promotes neuroprotection by reducing toxic NMDA receptor signaling. BDNF acts by initiating synaptic NMDA-receptor/nuclear-calcium-driven adaptogenomics, leading to increased expression of inhibin β-A (inhba). Inhibin β-A (its homodimer is known as activin A) in turn reduces neurotoxic extrasynaptic NMDA-receptor-mediated calcium influx, thereby shielding neurons against mitochondrial dysfunction, a major cause of excitotoxicity. Thus, BDNF induces acquired neuroprotection by enhancing synaptic activity and lowering extrasynaptic NMDA receptor death signaling through a nuclear calcium-inhibin β-A pathway. This process, which confers protection against ischemic brain damage in a mouse stroke model, may be compromised in Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, or aging-related neurodegenerative conditions that are associated with reduced BDNF levels and/or enhanced extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling.

Abstract: Summary
A variety of cancers depend on JAK2 signaling, including the high-risk subset of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) with CRLF2 rearrangements. Type I JAK2 inhibitors induce paradoxical JAK2 hyperphosphorylation in these leukemias and have limited activity. To improve the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition in B-ALL, we developed the type II inhibitor CHZ868, which stabilizes JAK2 in an inactive conformation. CHZ868 potently suppressed the growth of CRLF2-rearranged human B-ALL cells, abrogated JAK2 signaling, and improved survival in mice with human or murine B-ALL. CHZ868 and dexamethasone synergistically induced apoptosis in JAK2-dependent B-ALLs and further improved in vivo survival compared to CHZ868 alone. These data support the testing of type II JAK2 inhibition in patients with JAK2-dependent leukemias and other disorders.

Abstract: Summary
By integrating growth pathways on which cancer cells rely, steroid receptor coactivators (SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3) represent emerging targets in cancer therapeutics. High-throughput screening for SRC small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) uncovered MCB-613 as a potent SRC small molecule “stimulator” (SMS). We demonstrate that MCB-613 can super-stimulate SRCs’ transcriptional activity. Further investigation revealed that MCB-613 increases SRCs’ interactions with other coactivators and markedly induces ER stress coupled to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because cancer cells overexpress SRCs and rely on them for growth, we show that we can exploit MCB-613 to selectively induce excessive stress in cancer cells. This suggests that over-stimulating the SRC oncogenic program can be an effective strategy to kill cancer cells.

Abstract: Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most toxic and well-known mycotoxin that exists in many food stuff. Exposure to AFB1 has been reported to produce serious biochemical and structural alterations in human and animal organs, however, its effect on the brain is not well studied. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the possible histopathological effect of AFB1 and its withdrawal on the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Fifteen adult female Wistar rats were divided into 3 equal groups: control, AFB1 (15.75μg/kg/orally, once weekly, for 8 weeks) and recovery groups. Brain sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as for NeuN and GFAP immunostaining. AFB1 administration resulted in several histopathological alterations including; cellular degeneration, dilatation of the blood vessels and significant decrease in the thickness of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. In the frontal cortex, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of astrocyte distribution without changes in neuronal numbers. On the other hand, in the hippocampal CA1 region, there was a significant reduction of neuronal number and a significant increase in the percentage of astrocyte distribution. Importantly, AFB1-induced structural alterations were rescued following AFB1 withdrawal. In conclusion, AFB1 induce histological alterations in the rat brain which are potentially reversible upon withdrawal.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers instruct spatio-temporally specific gene expression in a manner tightly linked to higher-order chromatin architecture. Critical chromatin architectural regulators condensin I and condensin II play non-redundant roles controlling mitotic chromosomes. But the chromosomal locations of condensins and their functional roles in interphase are poorly understood. Here we report that both condensin complexes exhibit an unexpected, dramatic estrogen-induced recruitment to estrogen receptor α (ER-α)-bound eRNA+ active enhancers in interphase breast cancer cells, exhibiting non-canonical interaction with ER-α via its DNA-binding domain (DBD). Condensins positively regulate ligand-dependent enhancer activation at least in part by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase, HECTD1, to modulate the binding of enhancer-associated coactivators/corepressors, including p300 and RIP140, permitting full eRNA transcription, formation of enhancer:promoter looping, and the resultant coding gene activation. Collectively, our results reveal an important, unanticipated transcriptional role of interphase condensins in modulating estrogen-regulated enhancer activation and coding gene transcriptional program.

Abstract: Summary
FOXO family transcription factors are downstream effectors of Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and major determinants of aging in organisms ranging from worms to man. The molecular mechanisms that actively promote DAF16/FOXO stability and function are unknown. Here we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme MATH-33 as an essential DAF-16 regulator in IIS, which stabilizes active DAF-16 protein levels and, as a consequence, influences DAF-16 functions, such as metabolism, stress response, and longevity in C. elegans. MATH-33 associates with DAF-16 in cellulo and in vitro. MATH-33 functions as a deubiquitylase by actively removing ubiquitin moieties from DAF-16, thus counteracting the action of the RLE-1 E3-ubiquitin ligase. Our findings support a model in which MATH-33 promotes DAF-16 stability in response to decreased IIS by directly modulating its ubiquitylation state, suggesting that regulated oscillations in the stability of DAF-16 protein play an integral role in controlling processes such as metabolism and longevity.

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ elevation resulting from different Ca2+ pathways may play different roles in astrocyte functions. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), a light-gated cation channel, has been used to selectively stimulate astrocytes by inducing intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevation, but the exact underlying mechanism is still unclear. We found that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, light stimulation failed to induce [Ca2+]i elevation in astrocytes expressed ChR2. Pharmacological experiments excluded the involvement of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Further experiments demonstrated that the ChR2-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was mainly mediated by reversal of the Na+–Ca2+ exchanger following Na+ influx through ChR2 channels. Since intracellular Na+ homeostasis plays important roles in astrocytes, including the modulation of [Ca2+]i, neurotransmitter uptake and cell metabolism, our results indicate that ChR2 is a good candidate which could be used for mimicking the intracellular Na+ disturbance in astrocytes that occurs in various physiological and pathological processes including the uptake of neurotransmitters and ischemia, as well as the activities of various cation channels, ion exchangers, and pumps.

Abstract: Background
The role of the serotonin receptor 4 (5-HT4R) pathway in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) remains unclear. In the brain, induction of the calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein p11 enhances 5-HT4R translocation and signaling and could therefore be considered as a modulator of the 5-HT4R pathway in the myocardium. p11 expression is increased by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or antidepressant drugs (imipramine). Thus, we investigated whether p11 regulates the 5-HT4R pathway in the heart in physiological conditions or under pharmacological induction and the effects on calcium handling.
Methods and results
p11 expression was induced in vivo in healthy Wistar rats by imipramine (10mg/kg/21 days) and in vitro in left ventricular cardiomyocytes exposed to BDNF (50ng/ml/8h). Cell shortening and real-time Ca2+ measurements were processed on field-stimulated intact cardiomyocytes with the selective 5-HT4R agonist, prucalopride (1μM). Both imipramine and BDNF-induced cardiomyocyte p11 expression unmasked a strong response to prucalopride characterized by an increase of both cell shortening and Ca2+ transient amplitude compared to basal prucalopride associated with a high propensity to trigger diastolic Ca2+ events. Healthy rats treated with BDNF (180 ng/day/14 days) exhibited a sustained elevated heart rate following a single injection of prucalopride (0.1mg/kg) which was not observed prior to treatment.
Conclusions
We have identified a novel role for p11 in 5-HT4R signaling in healthy rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Increased p11 expression by BDNF and imipramine unraveled a 5-HT4R-mediated modulation of cardiac Ca2+ handling and ECC associated with deleterious Ca2+ flux disturbances. Such mechanism could partly explain some cardiac adverse effects induced by antidepressant treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations of IKZF1, encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS, are a hallmark of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however the role of IKZF1 alterations in ALL pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we show that in mouse models of BCR-ABL1 leukemia, Ikzf1 and Arf alterations synergistically promote the development of an aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Ikzf1 alterations result in acquisition of stem cell-like features, including self-renewal and increased bone marrow stromal adhesion. Retinoid receptor agonists reversed this phenotype, partly by inducing expression of IKZF1, resulting in abrogation of adhesion and self-renewal, cell cycle arrest, and attenuation of proliferation without direct cytotoxicity. Retinoids potentiated the activity of dasatinib in mouse and human BCR-ABL1 ALL, providing an additional therapeutic option in IKZF1-mutated ALL.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut microbiome is known to be associated with various human disorders, but a major challenge is to go beyond association studies and elucidate causalities. Mathematical modeling of the human gut microbiome at a genome scale is a useful tool to decipher microbe-microbe, diet-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Here, we describe the CASINO (Community And Systems-level INteractive Optimization) toolbox, a comprehensive computational platform for analysis of microbial communities through metabolic modeling. We first validated the toolbox by simulating and testing the performance of single bacteria and whole communities in vitro. Focusing on metabolic interactions between the diet, gut microbiota, and host metabolism, we demonstrated the predictive power of the toolbox in a diet-intervention study of 45 obese and overweight individuals and validated our predictions by fecal and blood metabolomics data. Thus, modeling could quantitatively describe altered fecal and serum amino acid levels in response to diet intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Many human cancers share similar metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect. However, it remains unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. Here we demonstrate a “synthetic lethal” interaction between oncogenic BRAF V600E and a ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E “rewires” metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
TNF is a master pro-inflammatory cytokine. Activation of TNFR1 by TNF can result in both RIPK1-independent apoptosis and RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. These cell death outcomes are regulated by two distinct checkpoints during TNFR1 signaling. TNF-mediated NF-κB-dependent induction of pro-survival or anti-apoptotic molecules is a well-known late checkpoint in the pathway, protecting cells from RIPK1-independent death. On the other hand, the molecular mechanism regulating the contribution of RIPK1 to cell death is far less understood. We demonstrate here that the IKK complex phosphorylates RIPK1 at TNFR1 complex I and protects cells from RIPK1 kinase-dependent death, independent of its function in NF-κB activation. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that inhibition of IKKα/IKKβ or its upstream activators sensitizes cells to death by inducing RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. We therefore report on an unexpected, NF-κB-independent role for the IKK complex in protecting cells from RIPK1-dependent death downstream of TNFR1.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are essential chromosomal structures that mediate accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Centromeres are specified epigenetically by the heritable incorporation of the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A. While many of the primary factors that mediate centromeric deposition of CENP-A are known, the chromatin and DNA requirements of this process have remained elusive. Here, we uncover a role for transcription in Drosophila CENP-A deposition. Using an inducible ectopic centromere system that uncouples CENP-A deposition from endogenous centromere function and cell-cycle progression, we demonstrate that CENP-A assembly by its loading factor, CAL1, requires RNAPII-mediated transcription of the underlying DNA. This transcription depends on the CAL1 binding partner FACT, but not on CENP-A incorporation. Our work establishes RNAPII passage as a key step in chaperone-mediated CENP-A chromatin establishment and propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, contributes to maintenance of proteostasis and to the cellular adaptation to stress. CMA substrates are delivered by a cytosolic chaperone to the lysosomal surface, where, upon unfolding, they are internalized through a membrane translocation complex. The molecular components that participate in CMA substrate targeting and translocation are well characterized, but those involved in CMA regulation remain mostly unknown. In this study, we have identified that CMA is under the positive control of the phosphatase PHLPP1 that associates with the lysosomal membrane and counteracts the inhibitory effect of mTORC2 on CMA. Lysosomal Akt, a target of the mTORC2/PHLPP1 kinase-phosphatase pair, modulates CMA activity by controlling the dynamics of assembly and disassembly of the CMA translocation complex at the lysosomal membrane. The lysosomal mTORC2/PHLPP1/Akt axis could become a target to restore CMA dysfunction in aging and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Access to high-quality antibodies is a necessity for the study of histones and their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Here we debut the Histone Antibody Specificity Database (http://www.histoneantibodies.com), an online and expanding resource cataloging the behavior of widely used, commercially available histone antibodies by peptide microarray. This interactive web portal provides a critical resource to the biological research community that routinely uses these antibodies as detection reagents for a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Summary
A highly glycosylated, trimeric envelope glycoprotein (Env) mediates HIV-1 cell entry. The high density and heterogeneity of the glycans shield Env from recognition by the immune system, but paradoxically, many potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize epitopes involving this glycan shield. To better understand Env glycosylation and its role in bNAb recognition, we characterized a soluble, cleaved recombinant trimer (BG505 SOSIP.664) that is a close structural and antigenic mimic of native Env. Large, unprocessed oligomannose-type structures (Man8-9GlcNAc2) are notably prevalent on the gp120 components of the trimer, irrespective of the mammalian cell expression system or the bNAb used for affinity purification. In contrast, gp41 subunits carry more highly processed glycans. The glycans on uncleaved, non-native oligomeric gp140 proteins are also highly processed. A homogeneous, oligomannose-dominated glycan profile is therefore a hallmark of a native Env conformation and a potential Achilles’ heel that can be exploited for bNAb recognition and vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Extrinsic cues from the niche are known to regulate adult stem cell self-renewal versus differentiation. Here, we report that an aminopeptidase Slamdance (Sda) acts in the Drosophila testicular niche to maintain germline stem cells (GSCs) and regulate progenitor germ cell dedifferentiation. Mutations in sda lead to dramatic testicular niche deterioration and stem cell loss. Recombinant Sda has specific aminopeptidase activity in vitro, and the in vivo function of Sda requires an intact aminopeptidase domain. Sda is required for accumulation of mature DE-cadherin, and overexpression of DE-cadherin rescues most sda mutant phenotypes, suggesting that DE-cadherin is an important target of Sda. Finally, Sda is both necessary and sufficient to promote dedifferentiation during aging and recovery from genetically manipulated depletion of GSCs. Together, our results suggest that a niche factor promotes both stem cell maintenance and progenitor cell dedifferentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Although DNA methylation is commonly invoked as a mechanism for transcriptional repression, the extent to which it actively silences transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites in vivo is unknown. To study the role of DNA methylation in the active modulation of TF binding, we quantified the effect of DNA methylation depletion on the genomic occupancy patterns of CTCF, an abundant TF with known methylation sensitivity that is capable of autonomous binding to its target sites in chromatin. Here, we show that the vast majority (>98.5%) of the tens of thousands of unoccupied, methylated CTCF recognition sequences remain unbound upon abrogation of DNA methylation. The small fraction of sites that show methylation-dependent binding in vivo are in turn characterized by highly variable CTCF occupancy across cell types. Our results suggest that DNA methylation is not a primary groundskeeper of genomic TF landscapes, but rather a specialized mechanism for stabilizing intrinsically labile sites.

Abstract: Summary
Insufficient nutrients disrupt physiological homeostasis, resulting in diseases and even death. Considering the physiological and pathological consequences of this metabolic stress, the adaptive responses that cells utilize under this condition are of great interest. We show that under low-glucose conditions, cells initiate adaptation followed by apoptosis responses using PERK/Akt and MEK1/ERK2 signaling, respectively. For adaptation, cells engage the ER stress-induced unfolded protein response, which results in PERK/Akt activation and cell survival. Sustained and extreme energetic stress promotes a switch to isoform-specific MEK1/ERK2 signaling, induction of GCN2/eIF2α phosphorylation, and ATF4 expression, which overrides PERK/Akt-mediated adaptation and induces apoptosis through ATF4-dependent expression of pro-apoptotic factors including Bid and Trb3. ERK2 activation during metabolic stress contributes to changes in TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism, and cell death, which is suppressed by glutamate and α-ketoglutarate supplementation. Taken together, our results reveal promising targets to protect cells or tissues from metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
The essential oxidoreductase Mia40/CHCHD4 mediates disulfide bond formation and protein folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Here, we investigated the interactome of Mia40 thereby revealing links between thiol-oxidation and apoptosis, energy metabolism, and Ca2+ signaling. Among the interaction partners of Mia40 is MICU1—the regulator of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), which transfers Ca2+ across the inner membrane. We examined the biogenesis of MICU1 and find that Mia40 introduces an intermolecular disulfide bond that links MICU1 and its inhibitory paralog MICU2 in a heterodimer. Absence of this disulfide bond results in increased receptor-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In the presence of the disulfide bond, MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer binding to MCU is controlled by Ca2+ levels: the dimer associates with MCU at low levels of Ca2+ and dissociates upon high Ca2+ concentrations. Our findings support a model in which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is regulated by a Ca2+-dependent remodeling of the uniporter complex.

Abstract: The type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) mediates increases in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) during fertilization in mammalian eggs. The activity of IP3R1 is enhanced during oocyte maturation, and phosphorylations by M-phase kinases are thought to positively regulate the activity of IP3R1. Accordingly, we and others have found that IP3R1 is phosphorylated at S421, T799 (by Cdk1) and at S436 (by ERK). Nevertheless, the effects of these phosphorylations on the function of the receptor and their impact on [Ca2+]i oscillations in eggs have not been clearly examined. To address this, we expressed in mouse oocytes an IP3R1 variant with the three indicated phosphorylation sites replaced by acidic residues, IIIE-IP3R1, such that it would act like a constitutively phosphorylated IP3R1, and examined [Ca2+]i parameters in response to stimuli. We found that overexpression of wild type (wt-IP3R1) or IIIE-IP3R1 in oocytes containing endogenous receptors caused dominant negative-like effects on Ca2+ release and oscillations. Therefore, we first selectively removed the endogenous IP3R1, and subsequently expressed the exogenous receptors. We found that in response to injection of PLCζ cRNA, eggs without endogenous IP3R1 failed to mount persistent Ca2+ oscillations, although expression of wt-IP3R1 restored their [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity. We also observed that the Ca2+ oscillatory ability and the sensitivity to IP3 in eggs expressing IIIE-IP3R1 were greater than in those expressing wt-IP3R1. Lastly, we found that exogenous IP3R1s are resistant to downregulation and support longer oscillations and of higher amplitude. Altogether, our results show that phosphorylations by Cdk1 and MAPK enhance the activity of IP3R1, which is consistent with its maximal activity observed at the time of fertilization and the role of Ca2+ release in egg activation.

Abstract: Summary
Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by axonopathy of the corticospinal motor neurons. A mutation in the gene encoding for Tectonin β-propeller containing protein 2 (TECPR2) causes HSP that is complicated by neurological symptoms. While TECPR2 is a human ATG8 binding protein and positive regulator of autophagy, the exact function of TECPR2 is unknown. Here, we show that TECPR2 associates with several trafficking components, among them the COPII coat protein SEC24D. TECPR2 is required for stabilization of SEC24D protein levels, maintenance of functional ER exit sites (ERES), and efficient ER export in a manner dependent on binding to lipidated LC3C. TECPR2-deficient HSP patient cells display alterations in SEC24D abundance and ER export efficiency. Additionally, TECPR2 and LC3C are required for autophagosome formation, possibly through maintaining functional ERES. Collectively, these results reveal that TECPR2 functions as molecular scaffold linking early secretion pathway and autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Animals have a remarkable ability to track dynamic sensory information. For example, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can locate a diacetyl odor source across a 100,000-fold concentration range. Here, we relate neuronal properties, circuit implementation, and behavioral strategies underlying this robust navigation. Diacetyl responses in AWA olfactory neurons are concentration and history dependent; AWA integrates over time at low odor concentrations, but as concentrations rise, it desensitizes rapidly through a process requiring cilia transport. After desensitization, AWA retains sensitivity to small odor increases. The downstream AIA interneuron amplifies weak odor inputs and desensitizes further, resulting in a stereotyped response to odor increases over three orders of magnitude. The AWA-AIA circuit drives asymmetric behavioral responses to odor increases that facilitate gradient climbing. The adaptation-based circuit motif embodied by AWA and AIA shares computational properties with bacterial chemotaxis and the vertebrate retina, each providing a solution for maintaining sensitivity across a dynamic range.

Abstract: Summary
Protein acylation links energetic substrate flux with cellular adaptive responses. SIRT5 is a NAD+-dependent lysine deacylase and removes both succinyl and malonyl groups. Using affinity enrichment and label free quantitative proteomics, we characterized the SIRT5-regulated lysine malonylome in wild-type (WT) and Sirt5−/− mice. 1,137 malonyllysine sites were identified across 430 proteins, with 183 sites (from 120 proteins) significantly increased in Sirt5−/− animals. Pathway analysis identified glycolysis as the top SIRT5-regulated pathway. Importantly, glycolytic flux was diminished in primary hepatocytes from Sirt5−/− compared to WT mice. Substitution of malonylated lysine residue 184 in glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with glutamic acid, a malonyllysine mimic, suppressed its enzymatic activity. Comparison with our previous reports on acylation reveals that malonylation targets a different set of proteins than acetylation and succinylation. These data demonstrate that SIRT5 is a global regulator of lysine malonylation and provide a mechanism for regulation of energetic flux through glycolysis.

Abstract: Summary
The most critical stage in initiation of melanoma metastasis is the radial to vertical growth transition, yet the triggers of this transition remain elusive. We suggest that the microenvironment drives melanoma metastasis independently of mutation acquisition. Here we examined the changes in microenvironment that occur during melanoma radial growth. We show that direct contact of melanoma cells with the remote epidermal layer triggers vertical invasion via Notch signaling activation, the latter serving to inhibit MITF function. Briefly, within the native Notch ligand-free microenvironment, MITF, the melanocyte lineage master regulator, binds and represses miR-222/221 promoter in an RBPJK-dependent manner. However, when radial growth brings melanoma cells into contact with distal differentiated keratinocytes that express Notch ligands, the activated Notch intracellular domain impairs MITF binding to miR-222/221 promoter. This de-repression of miR-222/221 expression triggers initiation of invasion. Our findings may direct melanoma prevention opportunities via targeting specific microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
The response regulator CpdR couples phosphorylation events in Caulobacter crescentus with the AAA+ protease ClpXP to provide punctuated degradation of crucial substrates involved in cell cycle regulation. CpdR functions like an adaptor to alter substrate choice by ClpXP; however, it remains unclear how CpdR influences its multiple targets. Here we show that, unlike canonical ClpXP adaptors, CpdR alone does not strongly bind its substrate. Instead, CpdR binds the N-terminal domain of ClpX and prepares (primes) the unfoldase for substrate engagement. This priming creates a recruitment interface that docks multiple substrates and additional adaptor components. We show that adaptor-dependent priming of ClpX avoids concentration-dependent inhibition that limits traditional scaffolding adaptors. Phosphosignaling disrupts the adaptor-protease interaction, and mutations in CpdR that impact ClpX binding tune adaptor activity and biological function. Together, these results reveal how a single adaptor can command global changes in proteome composition through priming of a protease.

Abstract: Summary
Many tumors become addicted to autophagy for survival, suggesting inhibition of autophagy as a potential broadly applicable cancer therapy. ULK1/Atg1 is the only serine/threonine kinase in the core autophagy pathway and thus represents an excellent drug target. Despite recent advances in the understanding of ULK1 activation by nutrient deprivation, how ULK1 promotes autophagy remains poorly understood. Here, we screened degenerate peptide libraries to deduce the optimal ULK1 substrate motif and discovered 15 phosphorylation sites in core autophagy proteins that were verified as in vivo ULK1 targets. We utilized these ULK1 substrates to perform a cell-based screen to identify and characterize a potent ULK1 small molecule inhibitor. The compound SBI-0206965 is a highly selective ULK1 kinase inhibitor in vitro and suppressed ULK1-mediated phosphorylation events in cells, regulating autophagy and cell survival. SBI-0206965 greatly synergized with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors to kill tumor cells, providing a strong rationale for their combined use in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Proper morphogenesis of neuronal dendritic spines is essential for the formation of functional synaptic networks. However, it is not known how spines are initiated. Here, we identify the inverse-BAR (I-BAR) protein MIM/MTSS1 as a nucleator of dendritic spines. MIM accumulated to future spine initiation sites in a PIP2-dependent manner and deformed the plasma membrane outward into a proto-protrusion via its I-BAR domain. Unexpectedly, the initial protrusion formation did not involve actin polymerization. However, PIP2-dependent activation of Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly was required for protrusion elongation. Overexpression of MIM increased the density of dendritic protrusions and suppressed spine maturation. In contrast, MIM deficiency led to decreased density of dendritic protrusions and larger spine heads. Moreover, MIM-deficient mice displayed altered glutamatergic synaptic transmission and compatible behavioral defects. Collectively, our data identify an important morphogenetic pathway, which initiates spine protrusions by coupling phosphoinositide signaling, direct membrane bending, and actin assembly to ensure proper synaptogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks requires action of multiple DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination. Here, we report a de novo heterozygous T131P mutation in RAD51/FANCR, the key recombinase essential for homologous recombination, in a patient with Fanconi anemia-like phenotype. In vitro, RAD51-T131P displays DNA-independent ATPase activity, no DNA pairing capacity, and a co-dominant-negative effect on RAD51 recombinase function. However, the patient cells are homologous recombination proficient due to the low ratio of mutant to wild-type RAD51 in cells. Instead, patient cells are sensitive to crosslinking agents and display hyperphosphorylation of Replication Protein A due to increased activity of DNA2 and WRN at the DNA interstrand crosslinks. Thus, proper RAD51 function is important during DNA interstrand crosslink repair outside of homologous recombination. Our study provides a molecular basis for how RAD51 and its associated factors may operate in a homologous recombination-independent manner to maintain genomic integrity.

Abstract: Morus alba root extract (MARE) has been used to treat hyperglycaemic conditions in oriental medicine. Here, we studied whether MARE possesses a cytotoxic effect on neuroblastoma. To check the cytotoxicity generated by MARE was whether relatively higher against the cancer cells rather than normal cells, we chose a neuroblastoma cell line (B103) and a normal cell line (Rat-2). A CCK assay revealed that MARE (10 μg/ml) reduced cell viability to approximately 60% compared to an untreated control in B103 cells. But in Rat-2 cells, MARE induced relatively lower cytotoxicity. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of MARE, we used flow cytometry combined with immunoblot analyses. We found that MARE-treatment could accumulate ROS and depolarize mitochondria membrane potential of B103 cells. Further treatment with MARE in B103 cells also could damage DNA and induce apoptosis. An expression study of p-Akt also suggested that there was a reduction in cellular proliferation and transcription along with the process of apoptosis, which was further evidenced by an increase in Bax and cleaved-caspase 3 activity. Together, our findings suggest that MARE produces more cytotoxicity in cancer cells while having a relatively attenuated effect on normal cells. As such, MARE may be a safer option in cancer therapeutics, and it also shows potential for the patients with symptoms of hyperglycemia and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Our study reveals a non-canonical role for CCL2 in modulating non-macrophage, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and shaping a tumor-permissive microenvironment during colon cancer development. We found that intratumoral CCL2 levels increased in patients with colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC), adenocarcinomas, and adenomas. Deletion of CCL2 blocked progression from dysplasia to adenocarcinoma and reduced the number of colonic MDSCs in a spontaneous mouse model of colitis-associated CRC. In a transplantable mouse model of adenocarcinoma and an APC-driven adenoma model, CCL2 fostered MDSC accumulation in evolving colonic tumors and enhanced polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC immunosuppressive features. Mechanistically, CCL2 regulated T cell suppression of PMN-MDSCs in a STAT3-mediated manner. Furthermore, CCL2 neutralization decreased tumor numbers and MDSC accumulation and function. Collectively, our experiments support that perturbing CCL2 and targeting MDSCs may afford therapeutic opportunities for colon cancer interception and prevention.

Abstract: Summary
Polyadenylation of mRNA is a key step in eukaryotic gene expression. However, despite the major impact of poly(A) tails on mRNA metabolism, the precise roles of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) in nuclear mRNA biogenesis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that rapid nuclear depletion of the S. cerevisiae PABP Nab2p leads to a global loss of cellular mRNA, but not of RNA lacking poly(A) tails. Disappearance of mRNA is a nuclear event, but not due to decreased transcription. Instead, the absence of Nab2p results in robust nuclear mRNA decay by the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome in a polyadenylation-dependent process. We conclude that Nab2p is required to protect early mRNA and therefore constitutes a crucial nuclear mRNA biogenesis factor.

Abstract: During tail regeneration in lizards a large mass of muscle tissue is formed in form of segmental myomeres of similar size located under the dermis of the new tail. These muscles accumulate glycogen and a fast form of myosin typical for twitch myofibers as it is shown by light and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry using an antibody directed against a Fast Myosin Heavy Chain. High resolution immunogold labeling shows that an intense labeling for fast myosin is localized over the thick filaments of the numerous myofibrils in about 70% of the regenerated myofibers while the labeling becomes less intense in the remaining muscle fibers. The present observations indicate that at least two subtypes of Fast Myosin containing muscle fibers are regenerated, the prevalent type was of the fast twitch containing few mitochondria, sparse glycogen, numerous smooth endoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The second, and less frequent type was a Fast-Oxidative-Glycolitic twitch fiber containing more mitochondria, a denser cytoplasm and myofibrils. Since their initial differentiation, myoblasts, myotubes and especially the regenerated myofibers do not accumulate any immuno-detectable Slow Myosin Heavy Chain. The study indicates that most of the segmental muscles of the regenerated tail serve for the limited bending of the tail during locomotion and trashing after amputation of the regenerated tail, a phenomenon that facilitates predator escape.

Abstract: Summary
Gated solely by activity-induced changes in intracellular calcium, small-conductance potassium channels (SKs) are critical for a variety of functions in the CNS, from learning and memory to rhythmic activity and sleep. While there is a wealth of information on SK2 gating, kinetics, and Ca2+ sensitivity, little is known regarding the regulation of SK2 subcellular localization. We report here that synaptic SK2 levels are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A, whose deficiency results in Angelman syndrome and overexpression in increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder. UBE3A directly ubiquitinates SK2 in the C-terminal domain, which facilitates endocytosis. In UBE3A-deficient mice, increased postsynaptic SK2 levels result in decreased NMDA receptor activation, thereby impairing hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity. Impairments in both synaptic plasticity and fear conditioning memory in UBE3A-deficient mice are significantly ameliorated by blocking SK2. These results elucidate a mechanism by which UBE3A directly influences cognitive function.

Abstract: Summary
In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, large polyQ repeats cause juvenile cases with different symptoms than those of adult-onset patients, who carry smaller expanded polyQ repeats. The mechanisms behind the differential pathology mediated by different polyQ repeat lengths remain unknown. By studying knockin mouse models of spinal cerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17), we found that a large polyQ (105 glutamines) in the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) preferentially causes muscle degeneration and reduces the expression of muscle-specific genes. Direct expression of TBP with different polyQ repeats in mouse muscle revealed that muscle degeneration is mediated only by the large polyQ repeats. Different polyQ repeats differentially alter TBP’s interaction with neuronal and muscle-specific transcription factors. As a result, the large polyQ repeat decreases the association of MyoD with TBP and DNA promoters. Our findings suggest that specific alterations in protein interactions by large polyQ repeats may account for the unique pathology in juvenile polyQ diseases.

Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development,

Abstract: Summary
Jarid2 is part of the Polycomb Repressor complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for genome-wide H3K27me3 deposition. Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Here, we show that Jarid2−/− ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2−/− with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development.

MYC Disrupts the Circadian Clock and Metabolism in Cancer Cells,

Abstract: Summary
The MYC oncogene encodes MYC, a transcription factor that binds the genome through sites termed E-boxes (5′-CACGTG-3′), which are identical to the binding sites of the heterodimeric CLOCK-BMAL1 master circadian transcription factor. Hence, we hypothesized that ectopic MYC expression perturbs the clock by deregulating E-box-driven components of the circadian network in cancer cells. We report here that deregulated expression of MYC or N-MYC disrupts the molecular clock in vitro by directly inducing REV-ERBα to dampen expression and oscillation of BMAL1, and this could be rescued by knockdown of REV-ERB. REV-ERBα expression predicts poor clinical outcome for N-MYC-driven human neuroblastomas that have diminished BMAL1 expression, and re-expression of ectopic BMAL1 in neuroblastoma cell lines suppresses their clonogenicity. Further, ectopic MYC profoundly alters oscillation of glucose metabolism and perturbs glutaminolysis. Our results demonstrate an unsuspected link between oncogenic transformation and circadian and metabolic dysrhythmia, which we surmise to be advantageous for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Through in silico and other analyses, we identified FOXC1 as expressed in at least 20% of human AML cases, but not in normal hematopoietic populations. FOXC1 expression in AML was almost exclusively associated with expression of the HOXA/B locus. Functional experiments demonstrated that FOXC1 contributes to a block in monocyte/macrophage differentiation and enhances clonogenic potential. In in vivo analyses, FOXC1 collaborates with HOXA9 to accelerate significantly the onset of symptomatic leukemia. A FOXC1-repressed gene set identified in murine leukemia exhibited quantitative repression in human AML in accordance with FOXC1 expression, and FOXC1high human AML cases exhibited reduced morphologic monocytic differentiation and inferior survival. Thus, FOXC1 is frequently derepressed to functional effect in human AML.

Suppressor of Fused Is Critical for Maintenance of Neuronal Progenitor Identity during Corticogenesis,

Abstract: Summary
Proper lineage progression and diversification of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) ensures the generation of projection neuron (PN) subtypes in the mammalian neocortex. Here, we show that Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) controls PN specification by maintaining the identity of NPCs in the embryonic neocortex. Deletion of Sufu in NPCs of the E10.5 mouse neocortex led to improper specification of progenitors and a reduction in intermediate progenitors (IPs) during corticogenesis. We found that Sufu deletion resulted in unstable Gli2 and Gli3 activity, leading to the ectopic activation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. The role of Sufu in maintaining progenitor identity is critical at early stages of corticogenesis, since deletion of Sufu at E13.5 did not cause similar abnormalities. Our studies revealed that Sufu critically modulates Shh signaling at early stages of neurogenesis for proper specification and maintenance of cortical NPCs to ensure the appropriate generation of cortical PN lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Although mass-spectrometry-based screens enable thousands of protein phosphorylation sites to be monitored simultaneously, they often do not cover important regulatory sites. Here, we hypothesized that this is due to the fact that nearly all large-scale phosphoproteome studies are initiated by trypsin digestion. We tested this hypothesis using multiple proteases for protein digestion prior to Ti4+-IMAC-based enrichment. This approach increases the size of the detectable phosphoproteome substantially and confirms the considerable tryptic bias in public repositories. We define and make available a less biased human phosphopeptide atlas of 37,771 unique phosphopeptides, correlating to 18,430 unique phosphosites, of which fewer than 1/3 were identified in more than one protease data set. We demonstrate that each protein phosphorylation site can be linked to a preferred protease, enhancing its detection by mass spectrometry (MS). For specific sites, this approach increases their detectability by more than 1,000-fold.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the unique molecular features of progenitors and their niche requires a genome-wide, whole-tissue approach with cellular resolution. Here, we co-isolate embryonic hair follicle (HF) placode and dermal condensate cells, precursors of adult HF stem cells and the dermal papilla/sheath niche, along with lineage-related keratinocytes and fibroblasts, Schwann cells, melanocytes, and a population inclusive of all remaining skin cells. With next-generation RNA sequencing, we define gene expression patterns in the context of the entire embryonic skin, and through transcriptome cross-comparisons, we uncover hundreds of enriched genes in cell-type-specific signatures. Axon guidance signaling and many other pathway genes are enriched in multiple signatures, implicating these factors in driving the large-scale cellular rearrangements necessary for HF formation. Finally, we share all data in an interactive, searchable companion website. Our study provides an overarching view of signaling within the entire embryonic skin and captures a molecular snapshot of HF progenitors and their niche.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria-specific antibody responses are short lived in children, leaving them susceptible to repeated bouts of febrile malaria. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this apparent immune deficiency are poorly understood. Recently, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been shown to play a critical role in generating long-lived antibody responses. We show that Malian children have resting PD-1+CXCR5+CD4+ Tfh cells in circulation that resemble germinal center Tfh cells phenotypically and functionally. Within this population, PD-1+CXCR5+CXCR3− Tfh cells are superior to Th1-polarized PD-1+CXCR5+CXCR3+ Tfh cells in helping B cells. Longitudinally, we observed that malaria drives Th1 cytokine responses, and accordingly, the less-functional Th1-polarized Tfh subset was preferentially activated and its activation did not correlate with antibody responses. These data provide insights into the Tfh cell biology underlying suboptimal antibody responses to malaria in children and suggest that vaccine strategies that promote CXCR3− Tfh cell responses may improve malaria vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Articular cartilage is well known for its simple uniqueness of avascular and aneural structure that has limited capacity to heal itself when injured. The use of three dimensional construct in tissue engineering holds great potential in regenerating cartilage defects. This study evaluated the in vitro cartilaginous tissue formation using rabbit's bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-seeded onto poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) PLGA/fibrin and PLGA scaffolds. The in vitro cartilaginous engineered constructs were evaluated by gross inspection, histology, cell proliferation, gene expression and sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) production at week 1, 2 and 3. After 3 weeks of culture, the PLGA/fibrin construct demonstrated gross features similar to the native tissue with smooth, firm and glistening appearance, superior histoarchitectural and better cartilaginous extracellular matrix compound in concert with the positive glycosaminoglycan accumulation on Alcian blue. Significantly higher cell proliferation in PLGA/fibrin construct was noted at day-7, day-14 and day-21 (p<0.05 respectively). Both constructs expressed the accumulation of collagen type II, collagen type IX, aggrecan and sox9, showed down-regulation of collagen type I as well as produced relative sGAG content with PLGA/fibrin construct exhibited better gene expression in all profiles and showed significantly higher relative sGAG content at each time point (p<0.05). This study suggested that with optimum in vitro manipulation, PLGA/fibrin when seeded with pluripotent non-committed BMSCs has the capability to differentiate into chondrogenic lineage and may serve as a prospective construct to be developed as functional tissue engineered cartilage.

Abstract: Summary
Because human white adipocytes display a high turnover throughout adulthood, a continuous supply of precursor cells is required to maintain adipogenesis. Bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells may contribute to mammalian adipogenesis; however, results in animal models are conflicting. Here we demonstrate in 65 subjects who underwent allogeneic BM or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation that, over the entire lifespan, BM/PBSC-derived progenitor cells contribute ∼10% to the subcutaneous adipocyte population. While this is independent of gender, age, and different transplantation-related parameters, body fat mass exerts a strong influence, with up to 2.5-fold increased donor cell contribution in obese individuals. Exome and whole-genome sequencing of single adipocytes suggests that BM/PBSC-derived progenitors contribute to adipose tissue via both differentiation and cell fusion. Thus, at least in the setting of transplantation, BM serves as a reservoir for adipocyte progenitors, particularly in obese subjects.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptome analyses have revealed that convergent gene transcription can produce many 3′-overlapping mRNAs in diverse organisms. Few studies have examined the fate of 3′-complementary mRNAs in double-stranded RNA-dependent nuclear phenomena, and nothing is known about the cytoplasmic destiny of 3′-overlapping messengers or their impact on gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the complementary tails of 3′-overlapping mRNAs can interact in the cytoplasm and promote post-transcriptional regulatory events including no-go decay (NGD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genome-wide experiments confirm that these messenger-interacting mRNAs (mimRNAs) form RNA duplexes in wild-type cells and thus have potential roles in modulating the mRNA levels of their convergent gene pattern under different growth conditions. We show that the post-transcriptional fate of hundreds of mimRNAs is controlled by Xrn1, revealing the extent to which this conserved 5′-3′ cytoplasmic exoribonuclease plays an unexpected but key role in the post-transcriptional control of convergent gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell analysis technologies such as mass cytometry allow for measurements of cellular heterogeneity with unprecedented dimensionality. Here, we applied dimensionality reduction and automated clustering methods on human T helper (TH) cells derived from peripheral blood and tonsils, which showed differential cell composition and extensive TH cell heterogeneity. Notably, this analysis revealed numerous subtypes of follicular helper T (TFH) cells that followed a continuum spanning both blood and tonsils. Furthermore, we identified tonsillar CXCR5loPD-1loCCR7lo TFH cells expressing interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-17 (IL-17), or Foxp3, indicating that TFH cells exhibit diverse functional capacities within extrafollicular stages. Regression analysis demonstrated that CXCR5loPD-1− and CXCR5loPD-1lo cells accumulate during childhood in secondary lymphoid organs, supporting previous findings that these subsets represent memory TFH cells. This study provides an in-depth comparison of human blood and tonsillar TFH cells and outlines a general approach for subset discovery and hypothesizing of cellular progressions.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal information processing requires a large amount of energy, indicating that sugars and other metabolites must be efficiently delivered. However, reliable neuronal function also depends on the maintenance of a constant microenvironment in the brain. Therefore, neurons are efficiently separated from circulation by the blood-brain barrier, and their long axons are insulated by glial processes. At the example of the Drosophila brain, we addressed how sugar is shuttled across the barrier to nurture neurons. We show that glial cells of the blood-brain barrier specifically take up sugars and that their metabolism relies on glycolysis, which, surprisingly, is dispensable in neurons. Glial cells secrete alanine and lactate to fuel neuronal mitochondria, and lack of glial glycolysis specifically in the adult brain causes neurodegeneration. Our work implies that a global metabolic compartmentalization and coupling of neurons and glial cells is a conserved, fundamental feature of bilaterian nervous systems independent of their size.

Abstract: Summary
Extra-medullary disease (EMD) in multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. However, molecular alterations that lead to EMD have not been well defined. We developed bone marrow (BM)- and EMD-prone MM syngeneic cell lines; identified that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcriptional patterns were significantly enriched in both clones compared to parental cells, together with higher levels of CXCR4 protein; and demonstrated that CXCR4 enhanced the acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype in MM cells with a phenotypic conversion for invasion, leading to higher bone metastasis and EMD dissemination in vivo. In contrast, CXCR4 silencing led to inhibited tumor growth and reduced survival. Ulocuplumab, a monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody, inhibited MM cell dissemination, supported by suppression of the CXCR4-driven EMT-like phenotype. These results suggest that targeting CXCR4 may act as a regulator of EMD through EMT-like transcriptional modulation, thus representing a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent MM disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
The diverse morphologies of animal tissues are underlain by different configurations of adherent cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin α5. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy within the zebrafish paraxial mesoderm mesenchyme reveals a physical association between Integrin α5 on adjacent cell membranes. This Integrin-Integrin complex correlates with conformationally inactive Integrin. Cadherin 2 stabilizes both the Integrin association and inactive Integrin conformation. Thus, Integrin repression within the adherent mesenchymal interior of the tissue biases Fibronectin fibrillogenesis to the tissue surface lacking cell-cell adhesions. Along nascent somite boundaries, Cadherin 2 levels decrease, becoming anti-correlated with levels of Integrin α5. Simultaneously, Integrin α5 clusters and adopts the active conformation and then commences ECM assembly. This cross-scale regulation of Integrin activation organizes a stereotypic pattern of ECM necessary for vertebrate body elongation and segmentation.

Abstract: Summary
Intercellular communications are essential for cell proliferation and differentiation during plant embryogenesis. However, analysis of intercellular communications in living material in real time is difficult owing to the restricted accessibility of the embryo within the flower. We established a live-embryo imaging system to visualize cell division and cell fate specification in Arabidopsis thaliana from zygote division in real time. We generated a cell-division lineage tree for early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. Lineage analysis showed that both the direction and time course of cell division between sister cells differed along the apical-basal or radial axes. Using the Arabidopsis kpl mutant, in which single-fertilization events are frequent, we showed that endosperm development is not required for pattern formation during early embryogenesis. Optical manipulation demonstrated that damage to the embryo initial cell induces cell fate conversion of the suspensor cell to compensate for the disrupted embryo initial cell even after cell fate is specified.

Abstract: Summary
Upon DNA stimulation, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) synthesizes the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) that binds to the STING, triggering antiviral interferon-β (IFN-β) production. However, it has remained undetermined how hosts regulate cGAS enzymatic activity after the resolution of DNA immunogen. Here, we show that Akt kinase plays a negative role in cGAS-mediated anti-viral immune response. Akt phosphorylated the S291 or S305 residue of the enzymatic domain of mouse or human cGAS, respectively, and this phosphorylation robustly suppressed its enzymatic activity. Consequently, expression of activated Akt led to the reduction of cGAMP and IFN-β production and the increase of herpes simplex virus 1 replication, whereas treatment with Akt inhibitor augmented cGAS-mediated IFN-β production. Furthermore, expression of the phosphorylation-resistant cGAS S291A mutant enhanced IFN-β production upon DNA stimulation, HSV-1 infection, and vaccinia virus infection. Our study identifies an Akt kinase-mediated checkpoint to fine-tune hosts’ immune responses to DNA stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular amyloid fibrils linked to neurodegenerative disease typically accumulate in an age-related manner, suggesting inherent cellular capacity for counteracting amyloid formation in early life. Metazoan molecular chaperones assist native folding and block polymerization of amyloidogenic proteins, preempting amyloid fibril formation. Chaperone capacity for amyloid disassembly, however, is unclear. Here, we show that a specific combination of human Hsp70 disaggregase-associated chaperone components efficiently disassembles α-synuclein amyloid fibrils characteristic of Parkinson’s disease in vitro. Specifically, the Hsc70 chaperone, the class B J-protein DNAJB1, and an Hsp110 family nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) provide ATP-dependent activity that disassembles amyloids within minutes via combined fibril fragmentation and depolymerization. This ultimately generates non-toxic α-synuclein monomers. Concerted, rapid interaction cycles of all three chaperone components with fibrils generate the power stroke required for disassembly. This identifies a powerful human Hsp70 disaggregase activity that efficiently disassembles amyloid fibrils and points to crucial yet undefined biology underlying amyloid-based diseases.

Abstract: Summary
MB-003, a plant-derived monoclonal antibody cocktail used effectively in treatment of Ebola virus infection in non-human primates, was unable to protect two of six animals when initiated 1 or 2 days post-infection. We characterized a mechanism of viral escape in one of the animals, after observation of two clusters of genomic mutations that resulted in five nonsynonymous mutations in the monoclonal antibody target sites. These mutations were linked to a reduction in antibody binding and later confirmed to be present in a viral isolate that was not neutralized in vitro. Retrospective evaluation of a second independent study allowed the identification of a similar case. Four SNPs in previously identified positions were found in this second fatality, suggesting that genetic drift could be a potential cause for treatment failure. These findings highlight the importance selecting different target domains for each component of the cocktail to minimize the potential for viral escape.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cellular transformation, yet little is known about metabolic changes that accompany tumor metastasis. Here we show that primary breast cancer cells display extensive metabolic heterogeneity and engage distinct metabolic programs depending on their site of metastasis. Liver-metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit a unique metabolic program compared to bone- or lung-metastatic cells, characterized by increased conversion of glucose-derived pyruvate into lactate and a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial metabolism. Liver-metastatic cells displayed increased HIF-1α activity and expression of the HIF-1α target Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1). Silencing HIF-1α reversed the glycolytic phenotype of liver-metastatic cells, while PDK1 was specifically required for metabolic adaptation to nutrient limitation and hypoxia. Finally, we demonstrate that PDK1 is required for efficient liver metastasis, and its expression is elevated in liver metastases from breast cancer patients. Our data implicate PDK1 as a key regulator of metabolism and metastatic potential in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons exhibit dynamic structural changes in response to extracellular stimuli. Microtubules (MTs) provide rapid and dramatic cytoskeletal changes within the structural framework. However, the molecular mechanisms and signaling networks underlying MT dynamics remain unknown. Here, we have applied a comprehensive and quantitative phospho-analysis of the MT destabilizer KIF2A to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of MT dynamics within neurons in response to extracellular signals. Interestingly, we identified two different sets of KIF2A phosphorylation profiles that accelerate (A-type) and brake (B-type) the MT depolymerization activity of KIF2A. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulates PAK1 and CDK5 kinases, which decrease the MT depolymerizing activity of KIF2A through B-type phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced outgrowth of neural processes. In contrast, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces ROCK2 kinase, which suppresses neurite outgrowth from round cells via A-type phosphorylation. We propose that these two mutually exclusive forms of KIF2A phosphorylation differentially regulate neuronal morphogenesis during development.

Abstract: We previously reported the role of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in response to anti-cancer drugs. The decreased expression of HDAC3 in anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cell line is responsible for the resistance to anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we investigated molecular mechanisms associated with regulation of HDAC3 expression. MG132, an inhibitor of proteasomal degradation, induced the expression of HDAC3 in various anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Ubiquitination of HDAC3 was observed in various anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cell lines. HDAC3 showed an interaction with SIAH2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, that has increased expression in various anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cell lines. miRNA array analysis showed the decreased expression of miR-335 in these cells. Targetscan analysis predicted the binding of miR-335 to the 3′-UTR of SIAH2. miR-335-mediated increased sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs was associated with its effect on HDAC3 and SIAH2 expression. miR-335 exerted apoptotic effects and inhibited ubiquitination of HDAC3 in anti-cancer drug-resistant cancer cell lines. miR-335 negatively regulated the invasion, migration, and growth rate of cancer cells. The mouse xenograft model showed that miR-335 negatively regulated the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells. The down-regulation of SIAH2 conferred sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. The results of the study indicated that the miR-335/SIAH2/HDAC3 axis regulates the response to anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: Cell differentiation is essential for maxillaries and tooth development. Facial mesenchymal tissue is formed by neural crest cells (NC). These cells are highly migratory, giving rise to various cell types, considered with a high level of plasticity, indicating that they contain progenitor cells with a great power of differentiation. In this study, it was analyzed the presence of NC cell progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) during maxillaries osteogenesis and odontogenesis in rats. Histological slides were collected in two phases: embryonic age of 15 and 17 days; 2, 4 and 7 days after birth. Immunohistochemistry for MSC markers (Osterix) and NC cells (Sox10, HNK1) was performed. The results showed positive expression for Osterix and HNK1 in undifferentiated ectomesenchymal cells in early and late stages; Sox10 was present only in early stages in undifferentiated cells. All markers were present in differentiated cells. Although the experiments performed do not allow us to explain a possible role for Osx, HNK1 and Sox10 in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells during osteogenesis and odontogenesis, it had shown important results not yet described: the presence of HNK1 and Sox10 in osteoblasts and odontoblasts in late development stages and in the tooth germ epithelial cells and ameloblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a degenerative disease of the lungs with an average survival post-diagnosis of 2–3 years. New therapeutic targets and treatments are necessary. Mutations in components of the telomere-maintenance enzyme telomerase or in proteins important for telomere protection are found in both familial and sporadic IPF cases. However, the lack of mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the human disease has hampered new advances. Here, we generate two independent mouse models that develop IPF owing to either critically short telomeres (telomerase-deficient mice) or severe telomere dysfunction in the absence of telomere shortening (mice with Trf1 deletion in type II alveolar cells). We show that both mouse models develop pulmonary fibrosis through induction of telomere damage, thus providing proof of principle of the causal role of DNA damage stemming from dysfunctional telomeres in IPF development and identifying telomeres as promising targets for new treatments.

Abstract: Summary
FACT, a heterodimer of Spt16 and Pob3, is an essential histone chaperone. We show that the H2A-H2B binding activity that is central to FACT function resides in short acidic regions near the C termini of each subunit. Mutations throughout these regions affect binding and cause correlated phenotypes that range from mild to lethal, with the largest individual contributions unexpectedly coming from an aromatic residue and a nearby carboxylate residue within each domain. Spt16 and Pob3 bind overlapping sites on H2A-H2B, and Spt16-Pob3 heterodimers simultaneously bind two H2A-H2B dimers, the same stoichiometry as the components of a nucleosome. An Spt16:H2A-H2B crystal structure explains the biochemical and genetic data, provides a model for Pob3 binding, and implies a mechanism for FACT reorganization that we confirm biochemically. Moreover, unexpected similarity to binding of ANP32E and Swr1 with H2A.Z-H2B reveals that diverse H2A-H2B chaperones use common mechanisms of histone binding and regulating nucleosome functions.

Abstract: Summary
After myocardial infarction in humans, lost cardiomyocytes are replaced by an irreversible fibrotic scar. In contrast, zebrafish hearts efficiently regenerate after injury. Complete regeneration of the zebrafish heart is driven by the strong proliferation response of its cardiomyocytes to injury. Here we show that, after cardiac injury in zebrafish, telomerase becomes hyperactivated, and telomeres elongate transiently, preceding a peak of cardiomyocyte proliferation and full organ recovery. Using a telomerase-mutant zebrafish model, we found that telomerase loss drastically decreases cardiomyocyte proliferation and fibrotic tissue regression after cryoinjury and that cardiac function does not recover. The impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation response is accompanied by the absence of cardiomyocytes with long telomeres and an increased proportion of cardiomyocytes showing DNA damage and senescence characteristics. These findings demonstrate the importance of telomerase function in heart regeneration and highlight the potential of telomerase therapy as a means of stimulating cell proliferation upon myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Summary
Insults to ER homeostasis activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which elevates protein folding and degradation capacity and attenuates protein synthesis. While a role for ubiquitin in regulating the degradation of misfolded ER-resident proteins is well described, ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translational reprogramming during the UPR remains uncharacterized. Using global quantitative ubiquitin proteomics, we identify evolutionarily conserved, site-specific regulatory ubiquitylation of 40S ribosomal proteins. We demonstrate that these events occur on assembled cytoplasmic ribosomes and are stimulated by both UPR activation and translation inhibition. We further show that ER stress-stimulated regulatory 40S ribosomal ubiquitylation occurs on a timescale similar to eIF2α phosphorylation, is dependent upon PERK signaling, and is required for optimal cell survival during chronic UPR activation. In total, these results reveal regulatory 40S ribosomal ubiquitylation as an important facet of eukaryotic translational control.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary history of tumor cell populations can be reconstructed from patterns of genetic alterations. In contrast to stable genetic events, epigenetic states are reversible and sensitive to the microenvironment, prompting the question whether epigenetic information can similarly be used to discover tumor phylogeny. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of DNA methylation in a cohort of low-grade gliomas and their patient-matched recurrences. Genes transcriptionally upregulated through promoter hypomethylation during malignant progression to high-grade glioblastoma were enriched in cell cycle function, evolving in parallel with genetic alterations that deregulate the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Moreover, phyloepigenetic relationships robustly recapitulated phylogenetic patterns inferred from somatic mutations. These findings highlight widespread co-dependency of genetic and epigenetic events throughout brain tumor evolution.

Abstract: Summary
We combine a genome-scale RNAi screen in mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) with genetic interaction, protein localization, and “protein-level dependency” studies—a systematic technique that uncovers post-transcriptional regulation—to delineate the network of factors that control the expression of Oct4, a key regulator of pluripotency. Our data signify that there are similarities, but also fundamental differences in Oct4 regulation in EpiSCs versus embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through multiparametric data analyses, we predict that Tox4 is associating with the Paf1C complex, which maintains cell identity in both cell types, and validate that this protein-protein interaction exists in ESCs and EpiSCs. We also identify numerous knockdowns that increase Oct4 expression in EpiSCs, indicating that, in stark contrast to ESCs, Oct4 is under active repressive control in EpiSCs. These studies provide a framework for better understanding pluripotency and for dissecting the molecular events that govern the transition from the pre-implantation to the post-implantation state.

Abstract: Summary
Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinase, a master regulator of DNA-damage response, is activated by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated at stalled replication forks or DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we identify the mismatch-binding protein MutSβ, a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH3, as a key player in this process. MSH2 and MSH3 form a complex with ATR and its regulatory partner ATRIP, and their depletion compromises the formation of ATRIP foci and phosphorylation of ATR substrates in cells responding to replication-associated DSBs. Purified MutSβ binds to hairpin loop structures that persist in RPA-ssDNA complexes and promotes ATRIP recruitment. Mutations in the mismatch-binding domain of MSH3 abolish the binding of MutSβ to DNA hairpin loops and its ability to promote ATR activation by ssDNA. These results suggest that hairpin loops might form in ssDNA generated at sites of DNA damage and trigger ATR activation in a process mediated by MutSβ.

Abstract: Summary
Stalled replication forks are a critical problem for the cell because they can lead to complex genome rearrangements that underlie cell death and disease. Processes such as DNA damage tolerance and replication fork reversal protect stalled forks from these events. A central mediator of these DNA damage responses in humans is the Rad5-related DNA translocase, HLTF. Here, we present biochemical and structural evidence that the HIRAN domain, an ancient and conserved domain found in HLTF and other DNA processing proteins, is a modified oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) fold that binds to 3′ ssDNA ends. We demonstrate that the HIRAN domain promotes HLTF-dependent fork reversal in vitro through its interaction with 3′ ssDNA ends found at forks. Finally, we show that HLTF restrains replication fork progression in cells in a HIRAN-dependent manner. These findings establish a mechanism of HLTF-mediated fork reversal and provide insight into the requirement for distinct fork remodeling activities in the cell.

Abstract: We have recently described a new class of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators composed of two jellyfish proteins, a variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the calcium binding protein apoaequorin, named GAP (Rodriguez-García et al., 2014). GAP is a unique dual-mode Ca2+ indicator, able to function either as a fluorescent or a luminescent probe, depending on whether the photoprotein aequorin is in its apo-state or reconstituted with its cofactor coelenterazine. We describe here a novel application of GAP as a low affinity bioluminescent indicator, suitable for measurements of [Ca2+] in ER or in Golgi apparatus. We used the low affinity variant, GAP1, which carries mutations in two EF-hands of aequorin, reconstituted with coelenterazine n. In comparison to previous bioluminescent aequorin fusions, the decay rate of GAP1 was decreased 8 fold and the affinity for Ca2+ was lowered one order of magnitude. This improvement allows long-term measurements in high Ca2+ environments avoiding fast aequorin consumption. GAP1 was targeted to the ER of various cell types, where it monitored resting Ca2+ concentrations in the range from 400 to 600μM. ER could be emptied of calcium by stimulation with ATP, carbachol or histamine in intact cells, and by challenge with inositol tris-phosphate in permeabilized cells. GAP1 was also targeted to the Golgi apparatus where it was able to precisely monitor long-term calcium dynamics. GAP1 provides a novel and robust indicator applicable to bioluminescent high-throughput quantitative assays.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic adaptation to hypoxia is critical for survival in metazoan species for which reason they have developed cellular mechanisms for mitigating its adverse consequences. Here, we have identified l-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) as a universal adaptive determinant of the hypoxia response. L2HG is a metabolite of unknown function produced by the reduction of mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate by malate dehydrogenase. L2HG accumulates in response to increases in 2-oxoglutarate, which occur as a result of tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction and increased mitochondrial reducing potential. These changes are closely coupled to cellular redox homeostasis, as increased cellular L2HG inhibits electron transport and glycolysis to offset the adverse consequences of mitochondrial reductive stress induced by hypoxia. Thus, L2HG couples mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy metabolism in a model of cellular redox regulation.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central energy gauge that regulates metabolism and has been increasingly involved in non-metabolic processes and diseases. However, AMPK’s direct substrates in non-metabolic contexts are largely unknown. To better understand the AMPK network, we use a chemical genetics screen coupled to a peptide capture approach in whole cells, resulting in identification of direct AMPK phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, the high-confidence AMPK substrates contain many proteins involved in cell motility, adhesion, and invasion. AMPK phosphorylation of the RHOA guanine nucleotide exchange factor NET1A inhibits extracellular matrix degradation, an early step in cell invasion. The identification of direct AMPK phosphorylation sites also facilitates large-scale prediction of AMPK substrates. We provide an AMPK motif matrix and a pipeline to predict additional AMPK substrates from quantitative phosphoproteomics datasets. As AMPK is emerging as a critical node in aging and pathological processes, our study identifies potential targets for therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase binds tightly to DNA to recognize promoters with high specificity but then releases these contacts during the initial stage of transcription. We report a site-specific crosslinking approach to map the DNA path in bacterial transcription intermediates at amino acid and nucleotide resolution. After validating the approach by showing that the DNA path in open complexes (RPO) is the same as in high-resolution X-ray structures, we define the path following substrate addition in “scrunched” complexes (RPITC). The DNA bulges that form within the transcription bubble in RPITC are positioned differently on the two strands. Our data suggest that the non-template strand bulge is extruded into solvent in complexes containing a 5-mer RNA, whereas the template strand bulge remains within the template strand tunnel, exerting stress on interactions between the β flap, β′ clamp, and σ3.2. We propose that this stress contributes to σ3.2 displacement from the RNA exit channel, facilitating promoter escape.

Abstract: Summary
Neuron identity transformations occur upon removal of specific regulatory factors in many different cellular contexts, thereby revealing the fundamental principle of alternative cell identity choices made during nervous system development. One common molecular interpretation of such homeotic cell identity transformations is that a regulatory factor has a dual function in activating genes defining one cellular identity and repressing genes that define an alternative identity. We provide evidence for an alternative, competition-based mechanism. We show that the MEC-3 LIM homeodomain protein can outcompete the execution of a neuropeptidergic differentiation program by direct interaction with the UNC-86/Brn3 POU homeodomain protein. MEC-3 thereby prevents UNC-86 from collaborating with the Zn finger transcription factor PAG-3/Gfi to induce peptidergic neuron identity and directs UNC-86 to induce an alternative differentiation program toward a glutamatergic neuronal identity. Homeotic control of neuronal identity programs has implications for the evolution of neuronal cell types.

Abstract: Summary
We have identified and characterized the TRPA1 channel of Varroa destructor (VdTRPA1), a major ectoparasitic mite of honey bee. One of the two VdTRPA1 isoforms, VdTRPA1L, was activated by a variety of plant-derived compounds, including electrophilic compounds, suggesting that chemical activation profiles are mostly shared between arthropod TRPA1 channels. Nevertheless, carvacrol and α-terpineol activated VdTRPA1L but not a honey bee noxious-stimuli-sensitive TRPA, AmHsTRPA, and Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1. Activation of VdTRPA1L in D. melanogaster taste neurons by the above compounds was sufficient to modify the gustatory behaviors. Carvacrol and α-terpineol repelled V. destructor in a laboratory assay, and α-terpineol repressed V. destructor entry for reproduction into the brood cells in hives. Understanding the functions of parasite TRP channels not only gives clues about the evolving molecular and cellular mechanisms of parasitism but also helps in the development of control methods.

Abstract: Summary
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been described as a major mechanism of immunosuppression in tumors, though the mechanisms of this are poorly understood. Here, we find that expression of IDO by tumor cells results in aggressive tumor growth and resistance to T-cell-targeting immunotherapies. We demonstrate that IDO orchestrates local and systemic immunosuppressive effects through recruitment and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), through a mechanism dependent on regulatory T cells (Tregs). Supporting these findings, we find that IDO expression in human melanoma tumors is strongly associated with MDSC infiltration. Treatment with a selective IDO inhibitor in vivo reversed tumor-associated immunosuppression by decreasing numbers of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs and Tregs and abolishing their suppressive function. These findings establish an important link between IDO and multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms active in the tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for therapeutic targeting of IDO as one of the central regulators of immune suppression.

Replication-Coupled PCNA Unloading by the Elg1 Complex Occurs Genome-wide and Requires Okazaki Fragment Ligation,

Abstract: Summary
The sliding clamp PCNA is a crucial component of the DNA replication machinery. Timely PCNA loading and unloading are central for genome integrity and must be strictly coordinated with other DNA processing steps during replication. Here, we show that the S. cerevisiae Elg1 replication factor C-like complex (Elg1-RLC) unloads PCNA genome-wide following Okazaki fragment ligation. In the absence of Elg1, PCNA is retained on chromosomes in the wake of replication forks, rather than at specific sites. Degradation of the Okazaki fragment ligase Cdc9 leads to PCNA accumulation on chromatin, similar to the accumulation caused by lack of Elg1. We demonstrate that Okazaki fragment ligation is the critical prerequisite for PCNA unloading, since Chlorella virus DNA ligase can substitute for Cdc9 in yeast and simultaneously promotes PCNA unloading. Our results suggest that Elg1-RLC acts as a general PCNA unloader and is dependent upon DNA ligation during chromosome replication.

Abstract: Summary
Increased levels of the mitochondria-shaping protein Opa1 improve respiratory chain efficiency and protect from tissue damage, suggesting that it could be an attractive target to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we show that Opa1 overexpression ameliorates two mouse models of defective mitochondrial bioenergetics. The offspring from crosses of a constitutive knockout for the structural complex I component Ndufs4 (Ndufs4−/−), and of a muscle-specific conditional knockout for the complex IV assembly factor Cox15 (Cox15sm/sm), with Opa1 transgenic (Opa1tg) mice showed improved motor skills and respiratory chain activities compared to the naive, non-Opa1-overexpressing, models. While the amelioration was modest in Ndufs4−/−::Opa1tg mice, correction of cristae ultrastructure and mitochondrial respiration, improvement of motor performance and prolongation of lifespan were remarkable in Cox15sm/sm::Opa1tg mice. Mechanistically, respiratory chain supercomplexes were increased in Cox15sm/sm::Opa1tg mice, and residual monomeric complex IV was stabilized. In conclusion, cristae shape amelioration by controlled Opa1 overexpression improves two mouse models of mitochondrial disease.

Abstract: Summary
Sprouting blood vessels are led by filopodia-studded endothelial tip cells that respond to angiogenic signals. Mosaic lineage tracing previously revealed that NRP1 is essential for tip cell function, although its mechanistic role in tip cells remains poorly defined. Here, we show that NRP1 is dispensable for genetic tip cell identity. Instead, we find that NRP1 is essential to form the filopodial bursts that distinguish tip cells morphologically from neighboring stalk cells, because it enables the extracellular matrix (ECM)-induced activation of CDC42, a key regulator of filopodia formation. Accordingly, NRP1 knockdown and pharmacological CDC42 inhibition similarly impaired filopodia formation in vitro and in developing zebrafish in vivo. During mouse retinal angiogenesis, CDC42 inhibition impaired tip cell and vascular network formation, causing defects that resembled those due to loss of ECM-induced, but not VEGF-induced, NRP1 signaling. We conclude that NRP1 enables ECM-induced filopodia formation for tip cell function during sprouting angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Studying mechanisms of malignant transformation of human pre-B cells, we found that acute activation of oncogenes induced immediate cell death in the vast majority of cells. Few surviving pre-B cell clones had acquired permissiveness to oncogenic signaling by strong activation of negative feedback regulation of Erk signaling. Studying negative feedback regulation of Erk in genetic experiments at three different levels, we found that Spry2, Dusp6, and Etv5 were essential for oncogenic transformation in mouse models for pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Interestingly, a small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6 selectively induced cell death in patient-derived pre-B ALL cells and overcame conventional mechanisms of drug-resistance.

Salmonella Disrupts Host Endocytic Trafficking by SopD2-Mediated Inhibition of Rab7,

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular bacterial pathogens of a diverse nature share the ability to evade host immunity by impairing trafficking of endocytic cargo to lysosomes for degradation, a process that is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Salmonella enterica type 3 secreted effector SopD2 mediates this process by binding the host regulatory GTPase Rab7 and inhibiting its nucleotide exchange. Consequently, this limits Rab7 interaction with its dynein- and kinesin-binding effectors RILP and FYCO1 and thereby disrupts host-driven regulation of microtubule motors. Our study identifies a bacterial effector capable of directly binding and thereby modulating Rab7 activity and a mechanism of endocytic trafficking disruption that may provide insight into the pathogenesis of other bacteria. Additionally, we provide a powerful tool for the study of Rab7 function, and a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Isolated clusters of mouse parotid acinar cells in combination with live cell imaging were used to explore the crosstalk in molecular signaling between purinergic, cholinergic and adrenergic pathways that integrate to control fluid and protein secretion. This crosstalk was manifested by (1) β-adrenergic receptor activation and amplification of P2X4R evoked Ca2+ signals, (2) β-adrenergic-induced amplification of P2X7R-evoked Ca2+ signals and (3) muscarinic receptor induced activation of P2X7Rs via exocytotic activity. The findings from our study reveal that purinoceptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling is modulated by crosstalk with canonical signaling pathways in parotid acinar cells. Integration of these signals are likely important for dynamic control of saliva secretion to match physiological demand in the parotid gland.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic programs that maintain leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal and oncogenic potential have been well defined; however, the comprehensive epigenetic landscape that sustains LSC cellular identity and functionality is less well established. We report that LSCs in MLL-associated leukemia reside in an epigenetic state of relative genome-wide high-level H3K4me3 and low-level H3K79me2. LSC differentiation is associated with reversal of these broad epigenetic profiles, with concomitant downregulation of crucial MLL target genes and the LSC maintenance transcriptional program that is driven by the loss of H3K4me3, but not H3K79me2. The H3K4-specific demethylase KDM5B negatively regulates leukemogenesis in murine and human MLL-rearranged AML cells, demonstrating a crucial role for the H3K4 global methylome in determining LSC fate.

Abstract: Summary
Primary piRNAs in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells arise from piRNA cluster transcripts and the 3′ UTRs of a subset of mRNAs, including Traffic jam (Tj) mRNA. However, it is unclear how these RNAs are determined as primary piRNA sources. Here, we identify a cis-acting 100-nt fragment in the Tj 3′ UTR that is sufficient for producing artificial piRNAs from unintegrated DNA. These artificial piRNAs were effective in endogenous gene transcriptional silencing. Yb, a core component of primary piRNA biogenesis center Yb bodies, directly bound the Tj-cis element. Disruption of this interaction markedly reduced piRNA production. Thus, Yb is the trans-acting partner of the Tj-cis element. Yb-CLIP revealed that Yb binding correlated with somatic piRNA production but Tj-cis element downstream sequences produced few artificial piRNAs. We thus propose that Yb determines primary piRNA sources through two modes of action: primary binding to cis elements to specify substrates and secondary binding to downstream regions to increase diversity in piRNA populations.
