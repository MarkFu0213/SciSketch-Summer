Abstract: Summary
To produce a diverse antibody repertoire, immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) loci undergo large-scale alterations in structure to facilitate juxtaposition and recombination of spatially separated variable (VH), diversity (DH), and joining (JH) genes. These chromosomal alterations are poorly understood. Uncovering their patterns shows how chromosome dynamics underpins antibody diversity. Using tiled Capture Hi-C, we produce a comprehensive map of chromatin interactions throughout the 2.8-Mb Igh locus in progenitor B cells. We find that the Igh locus folds into semi-rigid subdomains and undergoes flexible looping of the VH genes to its 3′ end, reconciling two views of locus organization. Deconvolution of single Igh locus conformations using polymer simulations identifies thousands of different structures. This heterogeneity may underpin the diversity of V(D)J recombination events. All three immunoglobulin loci also participate in a highly specific, developmentally regulated network of interchromosomal interactions with genes encoding B cell-lineage factors. This suggests a model of interchromosomal coordination of B cell development.

Abstract: Summary
The majority of activated ovarian follicles undergo atresia during reproductive life in mammals, and only a small number of follicles are ovulated. Though hormone treatment has been widely used to promote folliculogenesis, the molecular mechanism behind follicle selection and atresia remains under debate due to inconsistency among investigation models. Using a high-throughput molecular pathology strategy, we depicted a transcriptional atlas of mouse follicular granulosa cells (GCs) under physiological condition and obtained molecular signatures in healthy and atresia GCs during development. Functional results revealed hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) as a major effector downstream of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and HIF1 activation is essential for follicle growth. Energy shortage leads to prevalent AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and drives follicular atresia. FSHR-mTOR-HIF1 signaling helps follicles escape from the atresia fate, while energy stress persists. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular network behind follicle selection and atresia under physiological condition.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxic CD4 T cell effectors (ThCTLs) kill virus-infected major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ cells, contributing to viral clearance. We identify key factors by which influenza A virus infection drives non-cytotoxic CD4 effectors to differentiate into lung tissue-resident ThCTL effectors. We find that CD4 effectors must again recognize cognate antigen on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within the lungs. Both dendritic cells and B cells are sufficient as APCs, but CD28 co-stimulation is not needed. Optimal generation of ThCTLs requires signals induced by the ongoing infection independent of antigen presentation. Infection-elicited type I interferon (IFN) induces interleukin-15 (IL-15), which, in turn, supports CD4 effector differentiation into ThCTLs. We suggest that these multiple spatial, temporal, and cellular requirements prevent excessive lung ThCTL responses when virus is already cleared but ensure their development when infection persists. This supports a model where continuing infection drives the development of multiple, more differentiated subsets of CD4 effectors by distinct pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The naked mole rat (NMR) is the longest-lived rodent, resistant to multiple age-related diseases including neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the NMR’s resistance to neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. Here, we isolated oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from NMRs and compared their transcriptome with that of other mammals. Extracellular matrix (ECM) genes best distinguish OPCs of long- and short-lived species. Notably, expression levels of CD44, an ECM-binding protein that has been suggested to contribute to NMR longevity by mediating the effect of hyaluronan (HA), are not only high in OPCs of long-lived species but also positively correlate with longevity in multiple cell types/tissues. We found that CD44 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enhances basal ATF6 activity. CD44 modifies proteome and membrane properties of the ER and enhances ER stress resistance in a manner dependent on unfolded protein response regulators without the requirement of HA. HA-independent role of CD44 in proteostasis regulation may contribute to mammalian longevity.

Abstract: Objective
Herein, we compare the features of neoplastic cancer cells in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) grade II and III patients to their corresponding normal cells both in breast and axillary lymph node (ALN) tissues.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of 70 female breast cancer patients enrolled between 2018 and 2020 at Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Egypt, was analyzed for clinicopathological features presentation. Fresh tiny pieces of breast tissue and its associated ALN tissues were then processed to investigate the morphological appearance by scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, the histological architecture of tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin was studied by light microscope, while the characterization of the ultrastructure features of breast and ALN tissues was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.
Results
Clinicopathological presentation of patients revealed that the Egyptian female breast cancer population adhered to the global trends of breast cancer disease with elevated incidence rate among postmenopausal women (61.3%), high frequency of IDC (95.7%), and increased ALN metastasis (65.7%). The percentage of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, as key indicators for carcinogenesis and disease progression was 87.1% and 55.8%, respectively. The present study points to the observed discrepancies among the investigated variables in the diagnostic separation between IDC grade II and grade III. Ductal epithelial cells organization, nuclei size and irregularity, chromatin amount and uniformity, mitochondrial abundance and dysfunction were differentially manifested in IDC grades. Moreover, aberrations in the cellular organelles like lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid droplets vary according to the grade of IDC and the aggressiveness of the invasive breast cancer.
Conclusions
To sum up, this study emphasizes the importance of accurate specimen evaluation for treatment choice and decision.

Abstract: Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to the gradual destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth including gums, periodontal ligaments, alveolar bone, and root cementum. Recently, interests in alleviating symptoms of periodontitis (PD) using natural compounds is increasing. Avenanthramide-C (Avn-C) is a polyphenol found only in oats. It is known to exhibit various biological properties. To date, the effect of Avn-C on PD pathogenesis has not been confirmed. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the protective effects of Avn-C on periodontal inflammation and subsequent alveolar bone erosion in vitro and in vivo. Upregulated expression of catabolic factors, such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), MMP3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and COX2 induced by lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), was dramatically decreased by Avn-C treatment in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells. Moreover, alveolar bone erosion in the ligature-induced PD mouse model was ameliorated by intra-gingival injection of Avn-C. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that the inhibitory effects of Avn-C on the upregulation of catabolic factors were mediated via ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and NF-κB pathway that was activated by IL-1β or p38 MAPK and JNK signaling that was activated by TNF-α, respectively. Based on this study, we recommend that Avn-C may be a new natural compound that can be applied to PD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive brain stem tumor and the leading cause of pediatric cancer-related death. To date, these tumors remain incurable, underscoring the need for efficacious therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that the immune checkpoint TIM-3 (HAVCR2) is highly expressed in both tumor cells and microenvironmental cells, mainly microglia and macrophages, in DIPG. We show that inhibition of TIM-3 in syngeneic models of DIPG prolongs survival and produces long-term survivors free of disease that harbor immune memory. This antitumor effect is driven by the direct effect of TIM-3 inhibition in tumor cells, the coordinated action of several immune cell populations, and the secretion of chemokines/cytokines that create a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment favoring a potent antitumor immune response. This work uncovers TIM-3 as a bona fide target in DIPG and supports its clinical translation.

Abstract: Summary
p62 is a well-characterized autophagy receptor that recognizes and sequesters specific cargoes into autophagosomes for degradation. p62 promotes the assembly and removal of ubiquitinated proteins by forming p62-liquid droplets. However, it remains unclear how autophagosomes efficiently sequester p62 droplets. Herein, we report that p62 undergoes reversible S-acylation in multiple human-, rat-, and mouse-derived cell lines, catalyzed by zinc-finger Asp-His-His-Cys S-acyltransferase 19 (ZDHHC19) and deacylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). S-acylation of p62 enhances the affinity of p62 for microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-positive membranes and promotes autophagic membrane localization of p62 droplets, thereby leading to the production of small LC3-positive p62 droplets and efficient autophagic degradation of p62-cargo complexes. Specifically, increasing p62 acylation by upregulating ZDHHC19 or by genetic knockout of APT1 accelerates p62 degradation and p62-mediated autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Thus, the protein S-acylation-deacylation cycle regulates p62 droplet recruitment to the autophagic membrane and selective autophagic flux, thereby contributing to the control of selective autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells critical for protective immune responses against infection and cancer. Although NK cells differentiate in the bone marrow (BM) in an interleukin-15 (IL-15)-dependent manner, the cellular source of IL-15 remains elusive. Using NK cell reporter mice, we show that NK cells are localized in the BM in scattered and clustered manners. NK cell clusters overlap with monocyte and dendritic cell accumulations, whereas scattered NK cells require CXCR4 signaling. Using cell-specific IL-15-deficient mice, we show that hematopoietic cells, but not stromal cells, support NK cell development in the BM through IL-15. In particular, IL-15 produced by monocytes and dendritic cells appears to contribute to NK cell development. These results demonstrate that hematopoietic cells are the IL-15 niche for NK cell development in the BM and that BM NK cells are present in scattered and clustered compartments by different mechanisms, suggesting their distinct functions in the immune response.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by distinctive mutations in individual patients; therefore, each patient may display different cell-type compositions. Although most patients with AML achieve complete remission (CR) through intensive chemotherapy, the likelihood of relapse remains high. Several studies have attempted to characterize the genetic and cellular heterogeneity of AML; however, our understanding of the cellular heterogeneity of AML remains limited. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells obtained from same patients at different AML stages (diagnosis, CR, and relapse). We found that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at diagnosis were abnormal compared to normal HSCs. By improving the detection of the DNMT3A R882 mutation with targeted scRNAseq, we identified that DNMT3A-mutant cells that mainly remained were granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) or lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitors (LMPPs) from CR to relapse and that DNMT3A-mutant cells have gene signatures related to AML and leukemic cells. Copy number variation analysis at the single-cell level indicated that the cell type that possesses DNMT3A mutations is an important factor in AML relapse and that GMP and LMPP cells can affect relapse in patients with AML. This study advances our understanding of the role of DNMT3A in AML relapse and our approach can be applied to predict treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is associated with progressive phenotypic changes. Virtually all cellular phenotypes are produced by proteins, and their structural alterations can lead to age-related diseases. However, we still lack comprehensive knowledge of proteins undergoing structural-functional changes during cellular aging and their contributions to age-related phenotypes. Here, we conducted proteome-wide analysis of early age-related protein structural changes in budding yeast using limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS). The results, compiled in online ProtAge catalog, unraveled age-related functional changes in regulators of translation, protein folding, and amino acid metabolism. Mechanistically, we found that folded glutamate synthase Glt1 polymerizes into supramolecular self-assemblies during aging, causing breakdown of cellular amino acid homeostasis. Inhibiting Glt1 polymerization by mutating the polymerization interface restored amino acid levels in aged cells, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, and led to lifespan extension. Altogether, this comprehensive map of protein structural changes enables identifying mechanisms of age-related phenotypes and offers opportunities for their reversal.

Abstract: Background
Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is associated with significant maternal and fetal mortality. The present study is aimed at exploring the molecular mechanism of C1q/TNF-related protein 9 (CTRP9) in PIH.
Methods
Human placental vascular endothelial cells (HPVECs) underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to construct an in vitro PIH cellular model. Cell transfection was conducted to over-express CTRP9. The expression level of CTRP9 was determined by western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound-healing and tube formation assays were conducted to assess cell viability, apoptosis, migration and angiogenesis, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm) was evaluated adopting JC-1 staining. Mitochondrial ROS and copy number (mtDNA) were examined using superoxide indicator and real-time PCR, respectively. Then, HPVECs were pre-treated with Compound C (CC), the inhibitor of AMPK, for regulatory mechanism research.
Results
CTRP9 was downregulated in HPVECs exposed to H/R induction. CTRP9 overexpression retards H/R-mediated cell viability loss and apoptosis, impaired migration and angiogenesis of HPVECs. Meanwhile, CTRP9 overexpression alleviates H/R-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in HPVECs by enhancing mitochondrial ∆ψm, reducing mitochondrial ROS generation and increasing mtDNA copies. In addition, CTRP9 activated AMPK/Nrf2 signaling in H/R-mediated HPVECs, and additional treatment of CC greatly weakened the functional effects of CTRP9 in H/R-mediated HPVECs.
Conclusion
Our results suggested that CTRP9 protected against H/R-mediated HPVECs injuries dependent on AMPK/Nrf2 signaling and could be applied as a potential therapy for PIH.

Abstract: Summary
The translocation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) enables its activation. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of STING exit from the ER remains elusive. Here, we found that STING induces the activation of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) prior to STING trafficking in a TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1)-dependent manner. Intriguingly, activated TAK1 directly mediates STING phosphorylation on serine 355, which facilitates its interaction with STING ER exit protein (STEEP) and thereby promotes its oligomerization and translocation to the ERGIC for subsequent activation. Importantly, activation of TAK1 by monophosphoryl lipid A, a TLR4 agonist, boosts cGAMP-induced antitumor immunity dependent on STING phosphorylation in a mouse allograft tumor model. Taken together, TAK1 was identified as a checkpoint for STING activation by promoting its trafficking, providing a basis for combinatory tumor immunotherapy and intervention in STING-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal region 9p21 containing tumor suppressors CDKN2A/B and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is one of the most frequent genetic deletions in cancer. 9p21 loss is correlated with reduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Previously thought to be caused by CDKN2A/B loss, we now show that it is loss of MTAP that leads to poor outcomes on ICI therapy and reduced TIL density. MTAP loss causes accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) both intracellularly and extracellularly and profoundly impairs T cell function via the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and by adenosine receptor agonism. Administration of MTA-depleting enzymes reverses this immunosuppressive effect, increasing TILs and drastically impairing tumor growth and importantly, synergizes well with ICI therapy. As several studies have shown ICI resistance in 9p21/MTAP null/low patients, we propose that MTA degrading therapeutics may have substantial therapeutic benefit in these patients by enhancing ICI effectiveness.

Abstract: Summary
The amygdala, cholinergic basal forebrain, and higher-order auditory cortex (HO-AC) regulate brain-wide plasticity underlying auditory threat learning. Here, we perform multi-regional extracellular recordings and optical measurements of acetylcholine (ACh) release to characterize the development of discriminative plasticity within and between these brain regions as mice acquire and recall auditory threat memories. Spiking responses are potentiated for sounds paired with shock (CS+) in the lateral amygdala (LA) and optogenetically identified corticoamygdalar projection neurons, although not in neighboring HO-AC units. Spike- or optogenetically triggered local field potentials reveal enhanced corticofugal—but not corticopetal—functional coupling between HO-AC and LA during threat memory recall that is correlated with pupil-indexed memory strength. We also note robust sound-evoked ACh release that rapidly potentiates for the CS+ in LA but habituates across sessions in HO-AC. These findings highlight a distributed and cooperative plasticity in LA inputs as mice learn to reappraise neutral stimuli as possible threats.

Abstract: Summary
Cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) is widely studied as a potential avenue to treat obesity, but a thorough understanding of the metabolic changes driving CIT is lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the metabolic response to acute cold exposure, leveraging metabolomic profiling and minimally perturbative isotope tracing studies in unanesthetized mice. During cold exposure, brown adipose tissue (BAT) primarily fueled the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with fat in fasted mice and glucose in fed mice, underscoring BAT’s metabolic flexibility. BAT minimally used branched-chain amino acids or ketones, which were instead avidly consumed by muscle during cold exposure. Surprisingly, isotopic labeling analyses revealed that BAT uses glucose largely for TCA anaplerosis via pyruvate carboxylation. Finally, we find that cold-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis is critical for CIT during fasting, demonstrating a key functional role for glucose metabolism. Together, these findings provide a detailed map of the metabolic rewiring driving acute CIT.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is a negative regulator of the central melanocortin circuitry via presynaptic expression on agouti-related protein (AgRP) nerve terminals, from where it regulates GABA release onto secondary MC4R-expressing neurons. However, MC3R knockout (KO) mice also exhibit defective behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to fasting. Here, we demonstrate that MC3R KO mice exhibit defective activation of AgRP neurons in response to fasting, cold exposure, or ghrelin while exhibiting normal inhibition of AgRP neurons by sensory detection of food in the ad libitum-fed state. Using a conditional MC3R KO model, we show that the control of AgRP neuron activation by fasting and ghrelin requires the specific presence of MC3R within AgRP neurons. Thus, MC3R is a crucial player in the responsiveness of the AgRP soma to both hormonal and neuronal signals of energy need.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining healthy adipose tissue is crucial for metabolic health, requiring a deeper understanding of adipocyte development and response to high-calorie diets. This study highlights the importance of TET3 during white adipose tissue (WAT) development and expansion. Selective depletion of Tet3 in adipose precursor cells (APCs) reduces adipogenesis, protects against diet-induced adipose expansion, and enhances whole-body metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and Tet3 knockout (KO) APCs unveiled TET3 target genes, including Pparg and several genes linked to the extracellular matrix, pivotal for adipogenesis and remodeling. DNA methylation profiling and functional studies underscore the importance of DNA demethylation in gene regulation. Remarkably, targeted DNA demethylation at the Pparg promoter restored its transcription. In conclusion, TET3 significantly governs adipogenesis and diet-induced adipose expansion by regulating key target genes in APCs.

Abstract: Summary
The capacity of animals to respond to hazardous stimuli in their surroundings is crucial for their survival. In mammals, complex evaluations of the environment require large numbers and different subtypes of neurons. The nematode C. elegans avoids hazardous chemicals they encounter by reversing their direction of movement. How does the worms’ compact nervous system process the spatial information and direct motion change? We show here that a single interneuron, AVA, receives glutamatergic excitatory and inhibitory signals from head and tail sensory neurons, respectively. AVA integrates the spatially distinct and opposing cues, whose output instructs the animal’s behavioral decision. We further find that the differential activation of AVA stems from distinct localization of inhibitory and excitatory glutamate-gated receptors along AVA’s process and from different threshold sensitivities of the sensory neurons. Our results thus uncover a cellular mechanism that mediates spatial computation of nociceptive cues for efficient decision-making in C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death with roles in degenerative diseases and cancer. Excessive iron-catalyzed peroxidation of membrane phospholipids, especially those containing the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA), is central in driving ferroptosis. Here, we reveal that an understudied Golgi-resident scaffold protein, MMD, promotes susceptibility to ferroptosis in ovarian and renal carcinoma cells in an ACSL4- and MBOAT7-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MMD physically interacts with both ACSL4 and MBOAT7, two enzymes that catalyze sequential steps to incorporate AA in phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids. Thus, MMD increases the flux of AA into PI, resulting in heightened cellular levels of AA-PI and other AA-containing phospholipid species. This molecular mechanism points to a pro-ferroptotic role for MBOAT7 and AA-PI, with potential therapeutic implications, and reveals that MMD is an important regulator of cellular lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids are powerful experimental models for studying the ontogeny and progression of various diseases including cancer. Organoids are conventionally cultured in bulk using an extracellular matrix mimic. However, bulk-cultured organoids physically overlap, making it impossible to track the growth of individual organoids over time in high throughput. Moreover, local spatial variations in bulk matrix properties make it difficult to assess whether observed phenotypic heterogeneity between organoids results from intrinsic cell differences or differences in the microenvironment. Here, we developed a microwell-based method that enables high-throughput quantification of image-based parameters for organoids grown from single cells, which can further be retrieved from their microwells for molecular profiling. Coupled with a deep learning image-processing pipeline, we characterized phenotypic traits including growth rates, cellular movement, and apical-basal polarity in two CRISPR-engineered human gastric organoid models, identifying genomic changes associated with increased growth rate and changes in accessibility and expression correlated with apical-basal polarity. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of protective responses in healthy tissues. However, when it is active in tumor cells, it can result in drug resistance. KEAP1, the endogenous NRF2 inhibitor, binds NRF2 and redirects it to proteasomal degradation, so the KEAP1/NRF2 interaction is critical for maintaining NRF2 at a basal level. A number of clinically relevant KEAP1 mutations were shown to disrupt this critical KEAP1/NRF2 interaction, leading to elevated NRF2 levels and drug resistance. Here, we describe a small-molecule NRF2 inhibitor, R16, that selectively binds KEAP1 mutants and restores their NRF2-inhibitory function by repairing the disrupted KEAP1/NRF2 interactions. R16 substantially sensitizes KEAP1-mutated tumor cells to cisplatin and gefitinib, but does not do so for wild-type KEAP1 cells, and sensitizes KEAP1 G333C-mutated xenograft to cisplatin. We developed a BRET2-based biosensor system to detect the KEAP1/NRF2 interaction and classify KEAP1 mutations. This strategy would identify drug-resistant KEAP1 somatic mutations in clinical molecular profiling of tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Cells can irreversibly exit the cell cycle and become senescent to safeguard against uncontrolled proliferation. While the p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways are thought to mediate senescence, they also mediate reversible cell cycle arrest (quiescence), raising the question of whether senescence is actually reversible or whether alternative mechanisms underly the irreversibility associated with senescence. Here, we show that senescence is irreversible and that commitment to and maintenance of senescence are mediated by irreversible MYC degradation. Senescent cells start dividing when a non-degradable MYC mutant is expressed, and quiescent cells convert to senescence when MYC is knocked down. In early oral carcinogenesis, epithelial cells exhibit MYC loss and become senescent as a safeguard against malignant transformation. Later stages of oral premalignant lesions exhibit elevated MYC levels and cellular dysplasia. Thus, irreversible cell cycle exit associated with senescence is mediated by constitutive MYC degradation, but bypassing this degradation may allow tumor cells to escape during cancer initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate group behavior in response to cell density, and some bacterial viruses (phages) also respond to QS. In Staphylococcus aureus, the agr-encoded QS system relies on accumulation of auto-inducing cyclic peptides (AIPs). Other staphylococci also produce AIPs of which many inhibit S. aureus agr. We show that agr induction reduces expression of tarM, encoding a glycosyltransferase responsible for α-N-acetylglucosamine modification of the major S. aureus phage receptor, the wall teichoic acids. This allows lytic phage Stab20 and related phages to infect and kill S. aureus. However, in mixed communities, producers of inhibitory AIPs like S. haemolyticus, S. caprae, and S. pseudintermedius inhibit S. aureus agr, thereby impeding phage infection. Our results demonstrate that cross-species interactions dramatically impact phage susceptibility. These interactions likely influence microbial ecology and impact the efficacy of phages in medical and biotechnological applications such as phage therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Recent developments in genome sequencing have expanded the knowledge of genetic factors associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Among them, genetic variant ε4 of the APOE gene (APOE4) confers the greatest disease risk. Dysregulated glucose metabolism is an early pathological feature of AD. Using isogenic ApoE3 and ApoE4 astrocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we find that ApoE4 increases glycolytic activity but impairs mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes. Ultrastructural and autophagy flux analyses show that ApoE4-induced cholesterol accumulation impairs lysosome-dependent removal of damaged mitochondria. Acute treatment with cholesterol-depleting agents restores autophagic activity, mitochondrial dynamics, and associated proteomes, and extended treatment rescues mitochondrial respiration in ApoE4 astrocytes. Taken together, our study provides a direct link between ApoE4-induced lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Cold-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation is considered to improve metabolic health. In murine BAT, cold increases the fundamental molecule for mitochondrial function, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), but limited knowledge of NAD+ metabolism during cold in human BAT metabolism exists. We show that cold increases the serum metabolites of the NAD+ salvage pathway (nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide) in humans. Additionally, individuals with cold-stimulated BAT activation have decreased levels of metabolites from the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway (tryptophan, kynurenine). Serum nicotinamide correlates positively with cold-stimulated BAT activation, whereas tryptophan and kynurenine correlate negatively. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in BAT is related to markers of metabolic health. Our data indicate that cold increases serum tryptophan conversion to nicotinamide to be further utilized by BAT. We conclude that NAD+ metabolism is activated upon cold in humans and is probably regulated in a coordinated fashion by several tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare cancer resulting from the transformation of melanocytes in the uveal tract. Integrative analysis has identified four molecular and clinical subsets of UM. To improve our molecular understanding of UM, we performed extensive multi-omics characterization comparing two aggressive UM patient-derived xenograft models with normal choroidal melanocytes, including DNA optical mapping, specific histone modifications, and DNA topology analysis using Hi-C. Our gene expression and cytogenetic analyses suggest that genomic instability is a hallmark of UM. We also identified a recurrent deletion in the BAP1 promoter resulting in loss of expression and associated with high risk of metastases in UM patients. Hi-C revealed chromatin topology changes associated with the upregulation of PRAME, an independent prognostic biomarker in UM, and a potential therapeutic target. Our findings illustrate how multi-omics approaches can improve our understanding of tumorigenesis and reveal two distinct mechanisms of gene expression dysregulation in UM.

Abstract: Summary
Heritable non-genetic information can regulate a variety of complex phenotypes. However, what specific non-genetic cues are transmitted from parents to their descendants are poorly understood. Here, we perform metabolic methyl-labeling experiments to track the heritable transmission of methylation from ancestors to their descendants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We find heritable methylation in DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. We find that parental starvation elicits reduced fertility, increased heat stress resistance, and extended longevity in fed, naïve progeny. This intergenerational hormesis is accompanied by a heritable increase in N6ʹ-dimethyl adenosine (m6,2A) on the 18S ribosomal RNA at adenosines 1735 and 1736. We identified DIMT-1/DIMT1 as the m6,2A and BUD-23/BUD23 as the m7G methyltransferases in C. elegans that are both required for intergenerational hormesis, while other rRNA methyltransferases are dispensable. This study labels and tracks heritable non-genetic material across generations and demonstrates the importance of rRNA methylation for regulating epigenetic inheritance.

Abstract: Summary
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most common neuromuscular disorders and has no cure. Due to an unknown molecular mechanism, FSHD displays overlapping manifestations with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FSHD is caused by aberrant gain of expression of the transcription factor double homeobox 4 (DUX4), which triggers a pro-apoptotic transcriptional program resulting in inhibition of myogenic differentiation and muscle wasting. Regulation of DUX4 activity is poorly known. We identify Matrin 3 (MATR3), whose mutation causes ALS and dominant distal myopathy, as a cellular factor controlling DUX4 expression and activity. MATR3 binds to the DUX4 DNA-binding domain and blocks DUX4-mediated gene expression, rescuing cell viability and myogenic differentiation of FSHD muscle cells, without affecting healthy muscle cells. Finally, we characterize a shorter MATR3 fragment that is necessary and sufficient to directly block DUX4-induced toxicity to the same extent as the full-length protein. Collectively, our data suggest MATR3 as a candidate for developing a treatment for FSHD.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in biology by regulating protein degradation. Despite their importance, precise recognition specificity is known for a few of the 600 E3s. Here, we establish a two-pronged strategy for identifying and mapping critical residues of internal degrons on a proteome-scale in HEK-293T cells. We employ global protein stability profiling combined with machine learning to identify 15,800 peptides likely to contain sequence-dependent degrons. We combine this with scanning mutagenesis to define critical residues for over 5,000 predicted degrons. Focusing on Cullin-RING ligase degrons, we generated mutational fingerprints for 219 degrons and developed DegronID, a computational algorithm enabling the clustering of degron peptides with similar motifs. CRISPR analysis enabled the discovery of E3-degron pairs, of which we uncovered 16 pairs that revealed extensive degron variability and structural determinants. We provide the visualization of these data on the public DegronID data browser as a resource for future exploration.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical and molecular evidence indicates that high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) primarily originates from the fallopian tube, not the ovarian surface. However, the reasons for this preference remain unclear. Our study highlights significant differences between fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) and ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells, providing the molecular basis for FTEs as site of origin of HGSOC. FTEs, unlike OSEs, exhibit heightened replication stress (RS), impaired repair of stalled forks, ineffective G2/M checkpoint, and increased tumorigenicity. BRCA1 heterozygosity exacerbates these defects, resulting in RS suppression haploinsufficiency and an aggressive tumor phenotype. Examination of human and mouse sections reveals buildup of the RS marker 53BP1 primarily in the fallopian tubes, particularly at the fimbrial ends. Furthermore, menopausal status influences RS levels. Our study provides a mechanistic rationale for FTE as the site of origin for HGSOC, investigates the impact of BRCA1 heterozygosity, and lays the groundwork for targeting early HGSOC drivers.

Abstract: Summary
Current biochemical approaches have only identified the most well-characterized kinases for a tiny fraction of the phosphoproteome, and the functional assignments of phosphosites are almost negligible. Herein, we analyze the substrate preference catalyzed by a specific kinase and present a novel integrated deep neural network model named FuncPhos-SEQ for functional assignment of human proteome-level phosphosites. FuncPhos-SEQ incorporates phosphosite motif information from a protein sequence using multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) channels and network features from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using network embedding and deep neural network (DNN) channels. These concatenated features are jointly fed into a heterogeneous feature network to prioritize functional phosphosites. Combined with a series of in vitro and cellular biochemical assays, we confirm that NADK-S48/50 phosphorylation could activate its enzymatic activity. In addition, ERK1/2 are discovered as the primary kinases responsible for NADK-S48/50 phosphorylation. Moreover, FuncPhos-SEQ is developed as an online server.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays decisive roles in disabling T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, but the immunoregulatory functions of its biophysical properties remain elusive. Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening is a hallmark of solid tumors. Here, we report that the stiffened ECM contributes to the immunosuppression in TME via activating the Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK)-myosin IIA-filamentous actin (F-actin) mechanosignaling pathway in tumor cells to promote the generation of TRIM14-scavenging nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA)-F-actin stress fibers, thus accelerating the autophagic degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) to deprive tumor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and further attenuating tumor immunogenicity. Pharmacological inhibition of myosin IIA effector molecules with blebbistatin (BLEB) or the RhoA upstream regulator of this pathway with simvastatin (SIM) restored tumor-intrinsic cGAS-mediated cGAMP production and enhanced antitumor immunity. Our work identifies that ECM stiffness is an important biophysical cue to regulate tumor immunogenicity via the ROCK-myosin IIA-F-actin axis and that inhibiting this mechanosignaling pathway could boost immunotherapeutic efficacy for effective solid tumor treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) activate enhancers to drive cell-specific gene programs in response to signals, but our understanding of enhancer assembly during signaling events is incomplete. Here, we show that androgen receptor (AR) forms condensates through multivalent interactions mediated by its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) to orchestrate enhancer assembly in response to androgen signaling. AR IDR can be substituted by IDRs from selective proteins for AR condensation capacity and its function on enhancers. Expansion of the poly(Q) track within AR IDR results in a higher AR condensation propensity as measured by multiple methods, including live-cell single-molecule microscopy. Either weakening or strengthening AR condensation propensity impairs its heterotypic multivalent interactions with other enhancer components and diminishes its transcriptional activity. Our work reveals the requirement of an optimal level of AR condensation in mediating enhancer assembly and suggests that alteration of the fine-tuned multivalent IDR-IDR interactions might underlie AR-related human pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Relationships between the genome, transcriptome, and metabolome underlie all evolved phenotypes. However, it has proved difficult to elucidate these relationships because of the high number of variables measured. A recently developed data analytic method for characterizing the transcriptome can simplify interpretation by grouping genes into independently modulated sets (iModulons). Here, we demonstrate how iModulons reveal deep understanding of the effects of causal mutations and metabolic rewiring. We use adaptive laboratory evolution to generate E. coli strains that tolerate high levels of the redox cycling compound paraquat, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). We combine resequencing, iModulons, and metabolic models to elucidate six interacting stress-tolerance mechanisms: (1) modification of transport, (2) activation of ROS stress responses, (3) use of ROS-sensitive iron regulation, (4) motility, (5) broad transcriptional reallocation toward growth, and (6) metabolic rewiring to decrease NADH production. This work thus demonstrates the power of iModulon knowledge mapping for evolution analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus disease is a severe hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. We investigate transcriptome profiles at 3 h, 1 day, and 7 days after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. 3 h after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, we observe an increase in genes related to antigen presentation, sensing, and T and B cell receptors. The highest response occurs 1 day after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, with an increase of the gene expression of interferon-induced antiviral molecules, monocyte activation, and sensing receptors. This response is regulated by the HESX1, ATF3, ANKRD22, and ETV7 transcription factors. A plasma cell signature is observed on day 7 post-Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination, with an increase of CD138, MZB1, CD38, CD79A, and immunoglobulin genes. We have identified early expressed genes correlated with the magnitude of the antibody response 21 days after the MVA-BN-Filo and 364 days after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations. Our results provide early gene signatures that correlate with vaccine-induced Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms that prevent accidental activation of the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy circuit on healthy mitochondria are poorly understood. On the surface of damaged mitochondria, PINK1 accumulates and acts as the input signal to a positive feedback loop of Parkin recruitment, which in turn promotes mitochondrial degradation via mitophagy. However, PINK1 is also present on healthy mitochondria, where it could errantly recruit Parkin and thereby activate this positive feedback loop. Here, we explore emergent properties of the PINK1/Parkin circuit by quantifying the relationship between mitochondrial PINK1 concentrations and Parkin recruitment dynamics. We find that Parkin is recruited to mitochondria only if PINK1 levels exceed a threshold and then only after a delay that is inversely proportional to PINK1 levels. Furthermore, these two regulatory properties arise from the input-coupled positive feedback topology of the PINK1/Parkin circuit. These results outline an intrinsic mechanism by which the PINK1/Parkin circuit can avoid errant activation on healthy mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in many brain circuits and types of neurons; nevertheless, their functional significance for normal brain functions remains elusive. Here, we study the functions in the central nervous system of Silc1, an lncRNA we have shown previously to be important for neuronal regeneration in the peripheral nervous system. We found that Silc1 is rapidly and strongly induced in the hippocampus upon exposure to novelty and is required for efficient spatial learning. Silc1 production is important for induction of Sox11 (its cis-regulated target gene) throughout the CA1–CA3 regions and proper expression of key Sox11 target genes. Consistent with its role in neuronal plasticity, Silc1 levels decline during aging and in models of Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, we describe a plasticity pathway in which Silc1 acts as an immediate-early gene to activate Sox11 and induce a neuronal growth-associated transcriptional program important for learning.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into any cell lineage. Here, we report that ZEB1 and ZEB2 promote and inhibit mesodermal-to-myogenic specification of hESCs, respectively. Knockdown and/or overexpression experiments of ZEB1, ZEB2, or PAX7 in hESCs indicate that ZEB1 is required for hESC Nodal/Activin-mediated mesodermal specification and PAX7+ human myogenic progenitor (hMuP) generation, while ZEB2 inhibits these processes. ZEB1 downregulation induces neural markers, while ZEB2 downregulation induces mesodermal/myogenic markers. Mechanistically, ZEB1 binds to and transcriptionally activates the PAX7 promoter, while ZEB2 binds to and activates the promoter of the neural OTX2 marker. Transplanting ZEB1 or ZEB2 knocked down hMuPs into the muscles of a muscular dystrophy mouse model, showing that hMuP engraftment and generation of dystrophin-positive myofibers depend on ZEB1 and are inhibited by ZEB2. The mouse model results suggest that ZEB1 expression and/or downregulating ZEB2 in hESCs may also enhance hESC regenerative capacity for human muscular dystrophy therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of the human immune system to generate antibodies to any given antigen can be strongly influenced by immunoglobulin V-gene allelic polymorphisms. However, previous studies have provided only limited examples. Therefore, the prevalence of this phenomenon has been unclear. By analyzing >1,000 publicly available antibody-antigen structures, we show that many V-gene allelic polymorphisms in antibody paratopes are determinants for antibody binding activity. Biolayer interferometry experiments further demonstrate that paratope allelic polymorphisms on both heavy and light chains often abolish antibody binding. We also illustrate the importance of minor V-gene allelic polymorphisms with low frequency in several broadly neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus. Overall, this study not only highlights the pervasive impact of V-gene allelic polymorphisms on antibody binding but also provides mechanistic insights into the variability of antibody repertoires across individuals, which in turn have important implications for vaccine development and antibody discovery.

Abstract: Periodontitis represents a severe inflammatory illness in tooth supporting tissue. It has been supported that cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1), a common transcription factor, extensively participates in osteogenic differentiation. Here, the current study was to look into the impacts of CREB1 on the process of periodontitis and its possible action mechanism. After human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) were challenged with zoledronic acid (ZA), CREB1 expression was examined with RT-qPCR and western blotting. CCK-8 assay appraised cell activity. Following CREB1 elevation or/and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) silencing in ZA-treated PDLSCs, CCK-8 and TUNEL assays separately estimated cell viability and apoptosis. Western blotting tested the expression of apoptosis- and osteogenic differentiation-associated proteins. ALP staining measured PDLSCs osteogenic ability and ARS staining estimated mineralized nodule formation. JASPAR predicted the potential binding of CREB1 with VEGF promoter, which was then testified by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. RT-qPCR and western blotting tested VEGF expression. CREB1 expression was declined in ZA-exposed PDLSCs and CREB1 elevation exacerbated the viability and osteogenic differentiation while obstructed the apoptosis of PDLSCs. Additionally, CREB1 bond to VEGF promoter and transcriptionally activated VEGF expression. Further, VEGF absence partially stimulated the apoptosis while suppressed the osteogenic differentiation of CREB1-overexpressing PDLSCs treated by ZA. To be concluded, CREB1 might activate VEGF transcription to obstruct the apoptosis while contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of ZA-treated PDLSCs.

Abstract: Multiple families of Ca2+-permeable channels co-exist on lysosomal Ca2+ stores but how each family couples to its own unique downstream physiology is unclear. We have therefore investigated the Ca2+-signalling architecture underpinning different channels on the same vesicle that drive separate pathways, using phagocytosis as a physiological stimulus. Lysosomal Ca2+-channels are a major Ca2+ source driving particle uptake in macrophages, but different channels drive different aspects of Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis: TPC2 couples to dynamin activation, whilst TRPML1 couples to lysosomal exocytosis. We hypothesised that they are driven by discrete local plumes of Ca2+ around open channels (Ca2+ nanodomains). To test this, we optimized Ca2+-nanodomain recordings by screening panels of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) fused to TPC2 to monitor the [Ca2+] next to the channel. Signal calibration accounting for the distance of the GECI from the channel mouth reveals that, during phagocytosis, TPC2 generates local Ca2+ nanodomains around itself of up to 42 µM, nearly a hundred-fold greater than the global cytosolic [Ca2+] rise. We further show that TPC2 and TRPML1, though on the same lysosomes, generate autonomous Ca2+ nanodomains of high [Ca2+] that are largely insulated from one another, a platform allowing their discrete Ca2+-decoding to promote unique respective physiologies.

Abstract: Summary
The neural substrate for beat extraction and response entrainment to rhythms is not fully understood. Here we analyze the activity of medial premotor neurons in monkeys performing isochronous tapping guided by brief flashing stimuli or auditory tones. The population dynamics shared the following properties across modalities: the circular dynamics of the neural trajectories form a regenerating loop for every produced interval; the trajectories converge in similar state space at tapping times resetting the clock; and the tempo of the synchronized tapping is encoded in the trajectories by a combination of amplitude modulation and temporal scaling. Notably, the modality induces displacement in the neural trajectories in the auditory and visual subspaces without greatly altering the time-keeping mechanism. These results suggest that the interaction between the medial premotor cortex’s amodal internal representation of pulse and a modality-specific external input generates a neural rhythmic clock whose dynamics govern rhythmic tapping execution across senses.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in infants, arising from developmentally stalled neural crest-derived cells. Driving tumor differentiation is a promising therapeutic approach for this devastating disease. Here, we show that the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib not only inhibits proliferation but induces extensive neuronal differentiation of adrenergic neuroblastoma cells. Palbociclib-mediated differentiation is manifested by extensive phenotypic and transcriptional changes accompanied by the establishment of an epigenetic program driving expression of mature neuronal features. In vivo palbociclib significantly inhibits tumor growth in mouse neuroblastoma models. Furthermore, dual treatment with retinoic acid resets the oncogenic adrenergic core regulatory circuit of neuroblastoma cells, further suppresses proliferation, and can enhance differentiation, altering gene expression in ways that significantly correlate with improved patient survival. We therefore identify palbociclib as a therapeutic approach to dramatically enhance neuroblastoma differentiation efficacy that could be used in combination with retinoic acid to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: The choroid plexus is a small monolayered epithelium located in the brain ventricles and serves to secrete the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that envelops the brain and fills the central ventricles. The CSF secretion is sustained with a concerted effort of a range of membrane transporters located in a polarized fashion in this tissue. Prominent amongst these are the Na+/K+-ATPase, the Na+,K+,2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1), and several HCO3− transporters, which together support the net transepithelial transport of the major electrolytes, Na+ and Cl−, and thus drive the CSF secretion. The choroid plexus, in addition, serves an important role in keeping the CSF K+ concentration at a level compatible with normal brain function. The choroid plexus Na+/K+-ATPase represents a key factor in the barrier-mediated control of the CSF K+ homeostasis, as it increases its K+ uptake activity when faced with elevated extracellular K+ ([K+]o). In certain developmental or pathological conditions, the NKCC1 may revert its net transport direction to contribute to CSF K+ homeostasis. The choroid plexus ion transport machinery thus serves dual, yet interconnected, functions with its contribution to electrolyte and fluid secretion in combination with its control of brain K+ levels.

Abstract: Background
Netrin-1 has a neuroprotective effect by regulating angiogenesis, autophagy, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. This study investigated the effects of netrin-1 delivery to mouse Schwann cells and vascular endothelial cells using exosomes modified with rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptides.
Materials and methods
RVG-Lamp2b and/or Netrin-1 were overexpressed in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to obtain exosomes modified with RVG-Lamp2b and/or loaded with Netrin-1. Then, exosomes were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and co-cultured with mouse Schwann cells and endothelial cells. Netrin-1 expression in Schwann cells and endothelial cells was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Moreover, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays and Transwell assays were used to detect proliferation, migration, and invasion of Schwann cells and endothelial cells.
Results
Exosomes with RVG-Lamp2b entered Schwann cells more readily compared with the exosomes without RVG-Lamp2b. Meanwhile, this was not the case in endothelial cells. Netrin-1-loaded exosomes significantly promoted Netrin-1 expression, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in Schwann cells and endothelial cells. These effects were further enhanced by Netrin-1-loaded exosomes modified with RVG-Lamp2b in Schwann cells, but not in endothelial cells.
Conclusion
HucMSC-derived exosomes loaded with RVG-Lamp2b and Netrin-1 promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of Schwann cells.

Abstract: Summary
The MCM motor of the replicative helicase is loaded onto origin DNA as an inactive double hexamer before replication initiation. Recruitment of activators GINS and Cdc45 upon S-phase transition promotes the assembly of two active CMG helicases. Although work with yeast established the mechanism for origin activation, how CMG is formed in higher eukaryotes is poorly understood. Metazoan Downstream neighbor of Son (DONSON) has recently been shown to deliver GINS to MCM during CMG assembly. What impact this has on the MCM double hexamer is unknown. Here, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) on proteins isolated from replicating Xenopus egg extracts to identify a double CMG complex bridged by a DONSON dimer. We find that tethering elements mediating complex formation are essential for replication. DONSON reconfigures the MCM motors in the double CMG, and primordial dwarfism patients’ mutations disrupting DONSON dimerization affect GINS and MCM engagement in human cells and DNA synthesis in Xenopus egg extracts.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can undergo lineage-specific differentiation, giving rise to different cell types that constitute an organism. Although roles of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in these cells have been described, how the alternative splicing (AS) machinery regulates their expression has not been sufficiently explored. Here, we show that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-associated protein TOBF1 modulates the AS of transcripts necessary for maintaining stem cell identity in mouse ESCs. Among the genes affected is serine/arginine splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), whose AS leads to global changes in splicing and expression of a large number of downstream genes involved in the maintenance of ESC pluripotency. By overlaying information derived from TOBF1 chromatin occupancy, the distribution of its pluripotency-associated OCT-SOX binding motifs, and transcripts undergoing differential expression and AS upon its knockout, we describe local nuclear territories where these distinct events converge. Collectively, these contribute to the maintenance of mouse ESC identity.

Abstract: Summary
Decitabine (DAC) is clinically used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our genome-wide CRISPR-dCas9 activation screen using MDS-derived AML cells indicates that mitotic regulation is critical for DAC resistance. DAC strongly induces abnormal mitosis (abscission failure or tripolar mitosis) in human myeloid tumors at clinical concentrations, especially in those with TP53 mutations or antecedent hematological disorders. This DAC-induced mitotic disruption and apoptosis are significantly attenuated in DNMT1-depleted cells. In contrast, overexpression of Dnmt1, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, enhances DAC-induced mitotic defects in myeloid tumors. We also demonstrate that DAC-induced mitotic disruption is enhanced by pharmacological inhibition of the ATR-CLSPN-CHK1 pathway. These data challenge the current assumption that DAC inhibits leukemogenesis through DNMT1 inhibition and subsequent DNA hypomethylation and highlight the potent activity of DAC to disrupt mitosis through aberrant DNMT1-DNA covalent bonds.

Abstract: Summary
While synaptic plasticity is considered the basis of learning and memory, modifications of the intrinsic excitability of neurons can amplify the output of neuronal circuits and consequently change behavior. However, the mechanisms that underlie learning-induced changes in intrinsic excitability during memory formation are poorly understood. In the cerebellum, we find that silencing molecular layer interneurons completely abolishes fear memory, revealing their critical role in memory consolidation. The fear conditioning paradigm produces a lasting reduction in hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in these interneurons. This change increases intrinsic membrane excitability and enhances the response to synaptic stimuli. HCN loss is driven by a decrease in endocannabinoid levels via altered cGMP signaling. In contrast, an increase in release of cerebellar endocannabinoids during memory consolidation abolishes HCN plasticity. Thus, activity in cerebellar interneurons drives fear memory formation via a learning-specific increase in intrinsic excitability, and this process requires the loss of endocannabinoid-HCN signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) developed from multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWASs), PRSmulti, hold promise for improving PRS accuracy and generalizability across populations. To establish best practices for leveraging the increasing diversity of genomic studies, we investigated how various factors affect the performance of PRSmulti compared with PRSs constructed from single-ancestry GWASs (PRSsingle). Through extensive simulations and empirical analyses, we showed that PRSmulti overall outperformed PRSsingle in understudied populations, except when the understudied population represented a small proportion of the multi-ancestry GWAS. Furthermore, integrating PRSs based on local ancestry-informed GWASs and large-scale, European-based PRSs improved predictive performance in understudied African populations, especially for less polygenic traits with large-effect ancestry-enriched variants. Our work highlights the importance of diversifying genomic studies to achieve equitable PRS performance across ancestral populations and provides guidance for developing PRSs from multiple studies.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is surveilled at different stages by quality control (QC) mechanisms. The leukemia-associated DExH-box family helicase hDHX15/scPrp43 is known to disassemble spliceosomes after splicing. Here, using rapid protein depletion and analysis of nascent and mature RNA to enrich for direct effects, we identify a widespread splicing QC function for DHX15 in human cells, consistent with recent in vitro studies. We find that suboptimal introns with weak splice sites, multiple branch points, and cryptic introns are repressed by DHX15, suggesting a general role in promoting splicing fidelity. We identify SUGP1 as a G-patch factor that activates DHX15’s splicing QC function. This interaction is dependent on both DHX15’s ATPase activity and on SUGP1’s U2AF ligand motif (ULM) domain. Together, our results support a model in which DHX15 plays a major role in splicing QC when recruited and activated by SUGP1.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome is responsible for removal of ubiquitinated proteins. Although several aspects of its regulation (e.g., assembly, composition, and post-translational modifications) have been unraveled, studying its adaptive compartmentalization in response to stress is just starting to emerge. We found that following amino acid starvation, the proteasome is translocated from its large nuclear pool to the cytoplasm—a response regulated by newly identified mTOR-agonistic amino acids—Tyr, Trp, and Phe (YWF). YWF relay their signal upstream of mTOR through Sestrin3 by disrupting its interaction with the GATOR2 complex. The triad activates mTOR toward its downstream substrates p62 and transcription factor EB (TFEB), affecting both proteasomal and autophagic activities. Proteasome translocation stimulates cytosolic proteolysis which replenishes amino acids, thus enabling cell survival. In contrast, nuclear sequestration of the proteasome following mTOR activation by YWF inhibits this proteolytic adaptive mechanism, leading to cell death, which establishes this newly identified pathway as a key stress-coping mechanism.

Abstract: Background
Thanks to their multi-potency and secretory functions, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have long been established as an ideal cell type for skin wound healing and a candidate therapeutic strategy for excessive pathological scarring in the meantime. This study focuses on the effect of placental MSCs (PMSCs) on the activity of keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and the potential involvement of proenkephalin (PENK).
Methods
Secretory protein of PMSC that are lowly expressed in KFs were predicted by bioinformatics analyses. The expression of PENK in KFs was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. PMSCs were co-cultured with KFs and dermal fibroblasts (DFs) to examine their effect on proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of the distinct cell types. PENK secretion by PMSCs and its uptake by KFs were examined by ELISA, WB, and immunofluorescence staining. Loss-of-functions of PENK and p38-MAPK were induced to examine the activity of KFs in vitro and in mice.
Results
PENK, a secretory protein of PMSCs, was conspicuously downregulated in KFs compared to normal DFs. PMSC stimulation suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis of the co-cultured KFs but not DFs, which was ascribed to the upregulation of PENK protein in KFs. PMSCs-secreted PENK suppressed p38 phosphorylation in KFs. The proliferative and aggressive properties of KFs in vitro and the nodule-forming capacity of KFs in vivo were promoted upon PENK downregulation but suppressed by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190.
Conclusion
This work unravels that PMSCs-secreted PENK suppresses the p38 MAPK signaling to block hyperproliferation of KFs.

Abstract: We have studied Danio rerio (Zebrafish) TRPA1 channel using a method that combines single channel electrophysiological and optical recordings to evaluate lateral mobility and channel gating simultaneously in single channels. TRPA1 channel activation by two distinct chemical ligands: allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and TRPswitch B, results in substantial reduction of channel lateral mobility at the plasma membrane. Incubation with the cholesterol sequestering agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), prevents the reduction on lateral mobility induced by the two chemical agonists. This results strongly suggest that the open conformation of TRPA1 modulates channel lateral mobility probably by facilitating the insertion of the channel into cholesterol-enriched domains at the plasma membrane.

Abstract: In the digestive system, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most usual pernicious tumors. Despite great improvement has been created in treatment, it is still the second major reason of cancer-relevant death. Thus, further researches are required to explicate the latent molecular mechanisms and look for novel biomarkers. ZIC2 has been confirmed to be a facilitator in diversified cancers. However, the particular regulatory of ZIC2 in GC needs further investigation. In this work, it was notarized that ZIC2 expression was up-regulated in GC, and ZIC2 knockdown weakened GC cell proliferation. Moreover, ZIC2 suppression retarded cell migration and invasion. Additionally, results from the spheroid formation assay and western blot revealed that ZIC2 silencing reduced cell stemness. Next, we discovered that ZIC2 inhibition restrain the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through modulating β-catenin, Axin, c-myc and MMP-7 expression. At last, it was uncovered that ZIC2 repression relieved tumor growth in vivo. In summary, ZIC2 served as a promotive regulator in GC, aggravating growth and stemness in GC progression through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This discovery hinted that ZIC2 may be a valid target for anticancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The role of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in shaping tumor immunity is a key question that has not been addressable using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer. To induce TMB in lung GEMMs, we expressed an ultra-mutator variant of DNA polymerase-E (POLE)P286R in lung epithelial cells. Introduction of PoleP286R allele into KrasG12D and KrasG12D; p53L/L (KP) models significantly increase their TMB. Immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induced by Pole is partially dependent on p53. Corroborating these observations, survival of NSCLC patients whose tumors have TP53truncating mutations is shorter than those with TP53WT with immunotherapy. Immune resistance is in part through reduced antigen presentation and in part due to mutational heterogeneity. Total STING protein levels are elevated in Pole mutated KP tumors creating a vulnerability. A stable polyvalent STING agonist or p53 induction increases sensitivity to immunotherapy offering therapeutic options in these polyclonal tumors.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate whether interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and soluble IL-1 receptor 2 (sIL-1R2) are expressed in human granulosa cells (GCs) and relate to ovarian steroidogenesis. Ninety-six women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) were recruited. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to detect mRNAs and proteins of IL-1β and IL-1R2, respectively. The steroidogenesis of primary cultured GCs was evaluated following treatment with either IL-1β alone or IL-1β and FSH in combination. There were positive correlations between serum IL-1β and serum progesterone (r = 0.220, p = 0.032) and follicular fluid (FF) estradiol (r = 0.242, p = 0.018). Additionally, serum and FF sIL-1R2 were negatively and positively correlated with FF estradiol (r = −0.376, p = 0.005) and FF progesterone (r = 0.434, p = 0.001), respectively. The mRNA and protein expression of IL-1β and IL-1R2 became evident in GCs. IL-1β alone significantly increased estradiol secretion from GCs, but in the presence of FSH, it could notably promote progesterone secretion in addition to estradiol. In conclusion, IL-1β and sIL-1R2 are expressed in human GCs and substantially contribute to ovarian steroidogenesis, suggesting that the IL-1β system may be a potential target for optimizing ovarian hyperstimulation and steroidogenesis in IVF cycles.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are crucial for chromosome segregation, but their underlying sequences evolve rapidly, imposing strong selection for compensatory changes in centromere-associated kinetochore proteins to assure the stability of genome transmission. While this co-evolution is well documented between species, it remains unknown whether population-level centromere diversity leads to functional differences in kinetochore protein association. Mice (Mus musculus) exhibit remarkable variation in centromere size and sequence, but the amino acid sequence of the kinetochore protein CENP-A is conserved. Here, we apply k-mer-based analyses to CENP-A chromatin profiling data from diverse inbred mouse strains to investigate the interplay between centromere variation and kinetochore protein sequence association. We show that centromere sequence diversity is associated with strain-level differences in both CENP-A positioning and sequence preference along the mouse core centromere satellite. Our findings reveal intraspecies sequence-dependent differences in CENP-A/centromere association and open additional perspectives for understanding centromere-mediated variation in genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
The crosstalk between ferroptosis and cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here, we identify AMER1 as a key regulator of ferroptosis. AMER1 loss causes resistance to ferroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Interestingly, AMER1-deficient CRC cells preferentially form distant metastases, while AMER1-naive CRC cells mainly invade lymph nodes. Moreover, the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 effectively promotes hematogenous transfer of AMER1-naive cells. Mechanistically, AMER1 binds to SLC7A11 and ferritin light chain (FTL) and recruits β-TrCP1/2, which degrade SLC7A11 and FTL by ubiquitination. Therefore, AMER1 deficiency increases cellular cystine levels but decreases the pool of labile free iron, thereby enhancing resistance to ferroptosis in CRC cells. Thus, AMER1 deficiency increases the survival of CRC cells in the blood under conditions of high oxidative stress and then promotes hematogenous metastasis of CRC. In conclusion, AMER1 mediates the crosstalk between ferroptosis and cancer metastasis, which provides a window of opportunity for treating metastatic colorectal cancer patients with AMER1 mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the development of therapeutic extracellular vesicles (EVs) for cancer immunotherapy have allowed them to emerge as an alternative to cell therapy. In this proof-of-concept work, we develop bispecific EVs (BsEVs) by genetically engineering EV-producing dendritic cells (DCs) with aCD19 scFv and PD1 for targeting tumor antigens and blocking immune checkpoint proteins simultaneously. We find that these bispecific EVs (EVs-PD1-aCD19) have an impressive ability to accumulate in huCD19-expressing solid tumors following intravenous injection. In addition, EVs-PD1-aCD19 can remarkably reverse the immune landscape of the solid tumor by blocking PD-L1. Furthermore, EVs-PD1-aCD19 can also target tumor-derived EVs in circulation, which prevents the formation of a premetastatic niche in other tissues. Our technology is a demonstration of bispecific EV-based cancer immunotherapy, which may inspire treatments against various types of tumors with different surface antigens and even a patient-tailored therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) are key effector proteins of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, choreographing essential processes of cellular physiology. Here, we discover that ERK1/2 are subject to S-acylation, a reversible lipid modification of cysteine residues, at C271/C254. The levels of ERK1/2 S-acylation are modulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, mirroring its phosphorylation dynamics, and acylation-deficient ERK2 displays altered phosphorylation patterns. We show that ERK1/2 S-acylation is mediated by “writer” protein acyl transferases (PATs) and “eraser” acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) and that chemical inhibition of either lipid addition or removal alters ERK1/2’s EGF-triggered transcriptional program. Finally, in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, we find that ERK1/2 lipidation levels correlate with alterations in ERK1/2 lipidation writer/eraser expression, solidifying a link between ERK1/2 activity, ERK1/2 lipidation, and organismal health. This study describes how lipidation regulates ERK1/2 and offers insight into the role of dynamic S-acylation in cell signaling more broadly.

Abstract: Summary
Effective immunity requires the innate immune system to distinguish foreign nucleic acids from cellular ones. Cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are edited by the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 to evade being recognized as viral dsRNA by cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors, including MDA5 and PKR. The loss of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing of cellular dsRNA activates MDA5. Additional RNA-editing-independent functions of ADAR1 have been proposed, but a specific mechanism has not been delineated. We now demonstrate that the loss of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing specifically activates MDA5, whereas loss of the cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 isoform or its dsRNA-binding activity enabled PKR activation. Deleting both MDA5 and PKR resulted in complete rescue of the embryonic lethality of Adar1p150−/− mice to adulthood, contrasting with the limited or no rescue by removing MDA5 or PKR alone. Our findings demonstrate that MDA5 and PKR are the primary in vivo effectors of fatal autoinflammation following the loss of ADAR1p150.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphocytes that eradicate tumor cells. Inducing durable antitumor immune responses by NK cells represents a major priority of cancer immunotherapy. While cytosolic DNA sensing plays an essential role in initiating antitumor immunity, the role of NK cell-intrinsic STING signaling remains unclear. Here, we find that NK cell-intrinsic STING promotes antitumor responses and maintains a reservoir of TCF-1+ NK cells. In contrast, tumor cell-intrinsic cGAS and mtDNA are required for NK cell antitumor activity, indicating that tumor mtDNA recognition by cGAS partially triggers NK cell-intrinsic STING activation. Moreover, addition of cGAMP enables STING activation and type I interferon production in NK cells, thereby supporting the activation of NK cells in vitro. In humans, STING agonism promotes the expansion of TCF-1+ NK cells. This study provides insight into understanding how STING signaling drives NK cell antitumor immunity and the development of NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: The formation of uniform vitreous ice is a crucial step in the preparation of samples for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Despite the rapid technological progress in EM, controlling the thickness of vitreous ice on sample grids with reproducibility remains a major obstacle to obtaining high-quality data in cryo-EM imaging. The commonly employed classical blotting process faces the problem of excess water that cannot be absorbed by the filter paper, resulting in the formation of thick and heterogeneous ice. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines the recently developed nanowire self-wicking technique with the classical blotting method to effectively control the thickness and homogeneity of vitrified ice. With simple procedures, we generated a copper oxide spike (COS) grid by inducing COSs on commercially available copper grids, which can effectively remove excess water during the blotting procedure without damaging the holey carbon membrane. The ice thickness could be controlled with good reproducibility compared to non-oxidized grids. Incorporated into other EM techniques, our new modification method is an effective option for obtaining high-quality data during cryo-EM imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer deaths, and cancer cells evolve to adapt to various tumor microenvironments, which hinders the treatment of tumor metastasis. Platelets play critical roles in tumor development, especially during metastasis. Here, we elucidate the role of platelet mitochondria in tumor metastasis. Cancer cells are reprogrammed to a metastatic state through the acquisition of platelet mitochondria via the PINK1/Parkin-Mfn2 pathway. Furthermore, platelet mitochondria regulate the GSH/GSSG ratio and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells to promote lung metastasis of osteosarcoma. Impairing platelet mitochondrial function has proven to be an efficient approach to impair metastasis, providing a direction for osteosarcoma therapy. Our findings demonstrate mitochondrial transfer between platelets and cancer cells and suggest a role for platelet mitochondria in tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Anomalous aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a pathological hallmark of many degenerative synucleinopathies including Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite its strong link to disease, the precise molecular mechanisms that link α-Syn aggregation to neurodegeneration have yet to be elucidated. Here, we find that elevated α-Syn leads to an increase in the plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2, which precipitates α-Syn aggregation and drives toxic increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species leading to neuronal death. Upstream of this toxic signaling pathway is PIP5K1γ, whose abundance and localization is enhanced at the PM by α-Syn-dependent increases in ARF6. Selective inhibition of PIP5K1γ or knockout of ARF6 in neurons rescues α-Syn aggregation and cellular phenotypes of toxicity. Collectively, our data suggest that modulation of phosphoinositide metabolism may be a therapeutic target to slow neurodegeneration for PD and other related neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and alpha-synuclein (αSyn) inclusions. Many PD risk factors are known, but those affecting disease progression are not. Lifestyle and microbial dysbiosis are candidates in this context. Diet-driven gut dysbiosis and reduced barrier function may increase exposure of enteric neurons to toxins. Here, we study whether fiber deprivation and exposure to bacterial curli, a protein cross-seeding with αSyn, individually or together, exacerbate disease in the enteric and central nervous systems of a transgenic PD mouse model. We analyze the gut microbiome, motor behavior, and gastrointestinal and brain pathologies. We find that diet and bacterial curli alter the microbiome and exacerbate motor performance, as well as intestinal and brain pathologies, but to different extents. Our results shed important insights on how diet and microbiome-borne insults modulate PD progression via the gut-brain axis and have implications for lifestyle management of PD.

Abstract: Summary
As a prominent feature of gout, monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition induces gout flares, but its impact on immune inflammation in gout remission remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we characterize the transcription profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among intercritical remission gout, advanced remission gout, and normal controls. We find systemic inflammation in gout remission with MSU crystal deposition at the intercritical and advanced stages, evidenced by activated inflammatory pathways, strengthened inflammatory cell-cell interactions, and elevated arachidonic acid metabolic activity. We also find increased HLA-DQA1high classic monocytes and PTGS2high monocytes in advanced gout and overactivated CD8+ T cell subtypes in intercritical and advanced gout. Additionally, the osteoclast differentiation pathway is significantly enriched in monocytes, T cells, and B cells from advanced gout. Overall, we demonstrate systemic inflammation and distinctive immune responses in gout remission with MSU crystal deposition, allowing further exploration of the underlying mechanism and clinical significance in conversion from intercritical to advanced stage.

Abstract: Background
Sperm quality is a complex index used to evaluate the fertility potential of men. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 participate in sperm development and HOTAIR have critical roles in the regulation of oxidative stress responses. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of lncRNA MALAT1 and HOTAIR expression with sperm parameters, DNA fragmentation and malondialdehyde (MDA)levels in sperm fertility.
Methods
In this experimental study, semen samples (n = 30 fertile, n = 30 infertile) men were collected and evaluated for sperm parameters by computer-aided sperm analysis(CASA). Sperm DNA integrity quality was assessed by the Acridine orange(AO) test. MDA levels were determined by the Thiobarbituric acid reaction method. The expression of MALAT1 and HOTAIR was detected by RT-PCR.
Results
We observed a decreased level of MALAT1and HOTAIR expression in the infertile men (p < 0.001). The relative expression level of MALAT1and HOTAIR showed a positive correlation with motility and morphology (p < 0.001). Subsequently, we found the DNA damage and MDA levels was negatively correlated with expression level of genes of sperm (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
In this study the low expression of MALATI and HOTAIR resulted in the high level of MDA, DNA damage, and reduced motility of sperm. This study suggests the therapeutic opportunities in respect to MALATI and HOTAIR expression in the sperm function.

Abstract: Summary
Although phagocytic cells are documented targets of Leishmania parasites, it is unclear whether other cell types can be infected. Here, we use unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to simultaneously analyze host cell and Leishmania donovani transcriptomes to identify and annotate parasitized cells in spleen and bone marrow in chronically infected mice. Our dual-scRNA-seq methodology allows the detection of heterogeneous parasitized populations. In the spleen, monocytes and macrophages are the dominant parasitized cells, while megakaryocytes, basophils, and natural killer (NK) cells are found to be unexpectedly infected. In the bone marrow, the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) expressing phagocytic receptors FcγR and CD93 are the main parasitized cells. Additionally, we also detect parasitized cycling basal cells, eosinophils, and macrophages in chronically infected mice. Flow cytometric analysis confirms the presence of parasitized HSCs. Our unbiased dual-scRNA-seq method identifies rare, parasitized cells, potentially implicated in pathogenesis, persistence, and protective immunity, using a non-targeted approach.

Abstract: Summary
Weight regain after weight loss is a major challenge in the treatment of obesity. Immune cells adapt to fluctuating nutritional stress, but their roles in regulating weight regain remain unclear. Here, we identify a stem cell-like CD7+ monocyte subpopulation accumulating in the bone marrow (BM) of mice and humans that experienced dieting-induced weight loss. Adoptive transfer of CD7+ monocytes suppresses weight regain, whereas inducible depletion of CD7+ monocytes accelerates it. These cells, accumulating metabolic memories via epigenetic adaptations, preferentially migrate to the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT), where they secrete fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) to activate the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and facilitate beige fat thermogenesis. Nevertheless, CD7+ monocytes gradually enter a quiescent state after weight loss, accompanied by increased susceptibility to weight regain. Notably, administration of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) remarkably rejuvenates CD7+ monocytes, thus ameliorating rapid weight regain. Together, our findings identify a unique bone marrow-derived metabolic-memory immune cell population that could be targeted to combat obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal swelling during cytotoxic edema is triggered by Na+ and Cl− entry and is Ca2+ independent. However, the causes of neuronal death during swelling are unknown. Here, we investigate the role of large-conductance Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels in neuronal death during cytotoxic edema. Panx1 channel inhibitors reduce and delay neuronal death in swelling triggered by voltage-gated Na+ entry with veratridine. Neuronal swelling causes downstream production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that opens Panx1 channels. We confirm that ROS activates Panx1 currents with whole-cell electrophysiology and find scavenging ROS is neuroprotective. Panx1 opening and subsequent ATP release attract microglial processes to contact swelling neurons. Depleting microglia using the CSF1 receptor antagonist PLX3397 or blocking P2Y12 receptors exacerbates neuronal death, suggesting that the Panx1-ATP-dependent microglia contacts are neuroprotective. We conclude that cytotoxic edema triggers oxidative stress in neurons that opens Panx1 to trigger death but also initiates neuroprotective feedback mediated by microglia contacts.

Abstract: Summary
Failure to clear damaged mitochondria via mitophagy disrupts physiological function and may initiate damage signaling via inflammatory cascades, although how these pathways intersect remains unclear. We discovered that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential regulator NF-κB effector molecule (NEMO) is recruited to damaged mitochondria in a Parkin-dependent manner in a time course similar to recruitment of the structurally related mitophagy adaptor, optineurin (OPTN). Upon recruitment, NEMO partitions into phase-separated condensates distinct from OPTN but colocalizing with p62/SQSTM1. NEMO recruitment, in turn, recruits the active catalytic inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK) component phospho-IKKβ, initiating NF-κB signaling and the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Consistent with a potential neuroinflammatory role, NEMO is recruited to mitochondria in primary astrocytes upon oxidative stress. These findings suggest that damaged, ubiquitinated mitochondria serve as an intracellular platform to initiate innate immune signaling, promoting the formation of activated IKK complexes sufficient to activate NF-κB signaling. We propose that mitophagy and NF-κB signaling are initiated as parallel pathways in response to mitochondrial stress.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling dynamics elicit distinct cellular responses in a variety of contexts. The early zebrafish embryo is an ideal model to explore the role of Erk signaling dynamics in vivo, as a gradient of activated diphosphorylated Erk (P-Erk) is induced by fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling at the blastula margin. Here, we describe an improved Erk-specific biosensor, which we term modified Erk kinase translocation reporter (modErk-KTR). We demonstrate the utility of this biosensor in vitro and in developing zebrafish and Drosophila embryos. Moreover, we show that Fgf/Erk signaling is dynamic and coupled to tissue growth during both early zebrafish and Drosophila development. Erk activity is rapidly extinguished just prior to mitosis, which we refer to as mitotic erasure, inducing periods of inactivity, thus providing a source of heterogeneity in an asynchronously dividing tissue. Our modified reporter and transgenic lines represent an important resource for interrogating the role of Erk signaling dynamics in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of cancer. hTERT-immortalized, untransformed RPE-1 cells can acquire resistance to Taxol by derepressing the ABCB1 gene, encoding for the multidrug transporter P-gP. Here, we investigate how the ABCB1 gene is derepressed. ABCB1 activation is associated with reduced H3K9 trimethylation, increased H3K27 acetylation, and ABCB1 displacement from the nuclear lamina. While altering DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation had no major impact on ABCB1 expression, nor did it promote resistance, disrupting the nuclear lamina component Lamin B Receptor did promote the acquisition of a Taxol-resistant phenotype in a subset of cells. CRISPRa-mediated gene activation supported the notion that lamina dissociation influences ABCB1 derepression. We propose a model in which nuclear lamina dissociation of a repressed gene allows for its activation, implying that deregulation of the 3D genome topology could play an important role in tumor evolution and the acquisition of drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The senataxin (SETX, Sen1 in yeasts) RNA-DNA hybrid resolving helicase regulates multiple nuclear transactions, including DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair, but the molecular basis for Sen1 activities is ill defined. Here, Sen1 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstructions reveal an elongated inchworm-like architecture. Sen1 is composed of an amino terminal helical repeat Sen1 N-terminal (Sen1N) regulatory domain that is flexibly linked to its C-terminal SF1B helicase motor core (Sen1Hel) via an intrinsically disordered tether. In an autoinhibited state, the Sen1Sen1N domain regulates substrate engagement by promoting occlusion of the RNA substrate-binding cleft. The X-ray structure of an activated Sen1Hel engaging single-stranded RNA and ADP-SO4 shows that the enzyme encircles RNA and implicates a single-nucleotide power stroke in the Sen1 RNA translocation mechanism. Together, our data unveil dynamic protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces underpinning helicase regulation and inactivation of human SETX activity by RNA-binding-deficient mutants in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 2 neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
As evolutionarily conserved organelles, lipid droplets (LDs) carry out numerous functions and have various subcellular localizations in different cell types and species. In avian cone cells, there is a single apically localized LD. We demonstrated that CIDEA (cell death inducing DFFA like effector a) and microtubules promote the formation of the single LD in chicken cone cells. Centrins, which are well-known centriole proteins, target to the cone cell LD via their C-terminal calcium-binding domains. Centrins localize on cone cell LDs with the help of SPDL1-L (spindle apparatus coiled-coil protein 1-L), a previously uncharacterized isoform of the kinetochore-associated dynein adaptor SPDL1. The loss of CETN3 or overexpression of a truncated CETN1 abrogates the apical localization of the cone cell LD. Simulation analysis showed that multiple LDs or a single mispositioned LD reduces the light sensitivity. Collectively, our findings identify a role of centrins in the regulation of cone cell LD localization, which is important for the light sensitivity of cone cells.

Finally, we use simulated scenarios and biological data to illustrate the implications and applications of the approach.

Abstract: Summary
Dominant-negative mutations can help to investigate the biological mechanisms and to understand the selective pressures for multifunctional proteins. However, most studies have focused on recessive mutant effects that occur in the absence of a second functional gene copy, which overlooks the fact that most eukaryotic genomes contain more than one copy of many genes. We have identified dominant effects on yeast growth rate among all possible point mutations in ubiquitin expressed alongside a wild-type allele. Our results reveal more than 400 dominant-negative mutations, indicating that dominant-negative effects make a sizable contribution to selection acting on ubiquitin. Cellular and biochemical analyses of individual ubiquitin variants show that dominant-negative effects are explained by varied accumulation of polyubiquitinated cellular proteins and/or defects in conjugation of ubiquitin variants to ubiquitin ligases. Our approach to identify dominant-negative mutations is general and can be applied to other proteins of interest.

Abstract: Summary
Recent data have shown that gut microbiota has a major impact on the clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the context of solid tumors. ICI-based therapy acts by unlocking cognate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector responses, and increased sensitivity to ICIs is due to an enhancement of patients’ tumor antigen (TA)-specific CTL responses. Cancer clearance by TA-specific CTL requires expression of relevant TAs on cancer cells’ HLA class I molecules, and reduced HLA class I expression is a common mechanism used by cancer cells to evade the immune system. Here, we show that metabolites released by bacteria, in particular, phytosphingosine, can upregulate HLA class I expression on cancer cells, sensitizing them to TA-specific CTL lysis in vitro and in vivo, in combination with immunotherapy. This effect is mediated by postbiotic-induced upregulation of NLRC5 in response to upstream MYD88-NF-κB activation, thus significantly controlling tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Cas12a CRISPR technology, unlike Cas9, allows for facile multiplexing of guide RNAs from a single transcript, simplifying combinatorial perturbations. While Cas12a has been implemented for multiplexed knockout genetic screens, it has yet to be optimized for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens in human cells. Here, we develop a new Cas12a-based transactivation domain (TAD) recruitment system using the ALFA nanobody and demonstrate simultaneous activation of up to four genes. We screen a genome-wide library to identify modulators of growth and MEK inhibition, and we compare these results with those obtained with open reading frame (ORF) overexpression and Cas9-based CRISPRa. We find that the activity of multiplexed arrays is largely predictable from the best-performing guide and provide criteria for selecting active guides. We anticipate that these results will greatly accelerate the exploration of gene function and combinatorial phenotypes at scale.

Abstract: Summary
Visual stimuli that deviate from the current context elicit augmented responses in the primary visual cortex (V1). These heightened responses, known as “deviance detection,” require local inhibition in the V1 and top-down input from the anterior cingulate area (ACa). Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which the ACa and V1 interact to support deviance detection. Local field potential recordings in mice during an oddball paradigm showed that ACa-V1 synchrony peaks in the theta/alpha band (≈10 Hz). Two-photon imaging in the V1 revealed that mainly pyramidal neurons exhibited deviance detection, while contextually redundant stimuli increased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive interneuron (VIP) activity and decreased somatostatin-positive interneuron (SST) activity. Optogenetic drive of ACa-V1 inputs at 10 Hz activated V1-VIPs but inhibited V1-SSTs, mirroring the dynamics present during the oddball paradigm. Chemogenetic inhibition of V1-VIPs disrupted Aca-V1 synchrony and deviance detection in the V1. These results outline temporal and interneuron-specific mechanisms of top-down modulation that support visual context processing.

Abstract: Summary
Nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) produced by coronaviruses inhibits host protein synthesis. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Nsp1 C-terminal domain was shown to bind the ribosomal mRNA channel to inhibit translation, but it is unclear whether this mechanism is broadly used by coronaviruses, whether the Nsp1 N-terminal domain binds the ribosome, or how Nsp1 allows viral RNAs to be translated. Here, we investigated Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Bat-Hp-CoV coronaviruses using structural, biophysical, and biochemical experiments, revealing a conserved role for the C-terminal domain. Additionally, the N-terminal domain of Bat-Hp-CoV Nsp1 binds to the decoding center of the 40S subunit, where it would prevent mRNA and eIF1A accommodation. Structure-based experiments demonstrated the importance of decoding center interactions in all three coronaviruses and showed that the same regions of Nsp1 are necessary for the selective translation of viral RNAs. Our results provide a mechanistic framework to understand how Nsp1 controls preferential translation of viral RNAs.

Here, we report that acute ablation of CDKL5 from adult forebrain glutamatergic neurons leads to elevated neural network activity in the dentate gyrus and the occurrence of early-onset spontaneous seizures via tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling. We observe increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhanced activation of its receptor TrkB in the hippocampus of Cdkl5-deficient mice prior to the onset of behavioral seizures. Moreover, reducing TrkB signaling in these mice rescues the altered synaptic activity and suppresses recurrent seizures. These results suggest that TrkB signaling mediates epileptogenesis in a mouse model of CDD and that targeting this pathway might be effective for treating epilepsy in patients affected by CDKL5 mutations.

Abstract: Background
Toxic cardiomyopathies were a potentially fatal adverse effect of anthracycline therapy.
Aim
This study was conducted to demonstrate the pathogenetic, morphologic, and toxicologic effects of doxorubicin on the heart and to investigate how the MAPK /TNF-α pathway can be modulated to improve doxorubicin-Induced cardiac lesions using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and olive leaf extract (OLE).
Methods
During the study, 40 adult male rats were used. Ten were used to donate MSCs, and the other 30 were split into 5 equal groups: Group I was the negative control, Group II obtained oral OLE, Group III obtained an intraperitoneal cumulative dose of DOX (12 mg/kg) in 6 equal doses of 2 mg/kg every 48 h for 12 days, Group IV obtained intraperitoneal DOX and oral OLE at the same time, and Group V obtained intraperitoneal DOX and BM-MSCs through the tail vein at the same time for 12 days. Four weeks after their last dose of DOX, the rats were euthanized. By checking the bioinformatic databases, a molecularly targeted path was selected. Then the histological, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of ERK, JNK, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α were done.
Results
Myocardial immunohistochemistry revealed severe fibrosis, cell degeneration, increased vimentin, and decreased CD-31 expression in the DOX-treated group, along with a marked shift in morphometric measurements, a disordered ultrastructure, and overexpression of inflammatory genes (ERK, NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α), oxidative stress markers, and cardiac biomarkers. Both groups IV and V displayed reduced cardiac fibrosis or inflammation, restoration of the microstructure and ultrastructure of the myocardium, downregulation of inflammatory genes, markers of oxidative stress, and cardiac biomarkers, a notable decline in vimentin, and an uptick in CD-31 expression. In contrast to group IV, group V showed a considerable beneficial effect.
Conclusion
Both OLE and BM-MSCs showed an ameliorating effect in rat models of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, with BM-MSCs showing a greater influence than OLE.

Abstract: Summary
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus that causes human neuroinfections and represents a growing health problem. The human monoclonal antibody T025 targets envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of TBEV and related tick-borne flaviviruses, potently neutralizing TBEV in vitro and in preclinical models, representing a promising candidate for clinical development. We demonstrate that TBEV escape in the presence of T025 or T028 (another EDIII-targeting human monoclonal antibody) results in virus variants of reduced pathogenicity, characterized by distinct sets of amino acid changes in EDII and EDIII that are jointly needed to confer resistance. EDIII substitution K311N impairs formation of a salt bridge critical for T025-epitope interaction. EDII substitution E230K is not on the T025 epitope but likely induces quaternary rearrangements of the virus surface because of repulsion of positively charged residues on the adjacent EDI. A combination of T025 and T028 prevents virus escape and improves neutralization.

Abstract: Summary
Sebaceous glands (SGs) release oils that protect our skin, but how these glands respond to injury has not been previously examined. Here, we report that SGs are largely self-renewed by dedicated stem cell pools during homeostasis. Using targeted single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncovered both direct and indirect paths by which resident SG progenitors ordinarily differentiate into sebocytes, including transit through a Krt5+PPARγ+ transitional basal cell state. Upon skin injury, however, SG progenitors depart their niche, reepithelialize the wound, and are replaced by hair-follicle-derived stem cells. Furthermore, following targeted genetic ablation of >99% of SGs from dorsal skin, these glands unexpectedly regenerate within weeks. This regenerative process is mediated by alternative stem cells originating from the hair follicle bulge, is dependent upon FGFR2 signaling, and can be accelerated by inducing hair growth. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that stem cell plasticity promotes SG durability following injury.

Abstract: Summary
With the emergence of multiple predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, it becomes important to have a comprehensive assessment of their viral fitness and transmissibility. Here, we demonstrate that natural temperature differences between the upper (33°C) and lower (37°C) respiratory tract have profound effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmissibility. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the NSP12 mutations P323L or P323L/G671S exhibit enhanced RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at 33°C compared with 37°C and high transmissibility. Molecular dynamics simulations and microscale thermophoresis demonstrate that the NSP12 P323L and P323L/G671S mutations stabilize the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex through hydrophobic effects, leading to increased viral RdRp activity. Furthermore, competitive transmissibility assay reveals that reverse genetic (RG)-P323L or RG-P323L/G671S NSP12 outcompetes RG-WT (wild-type) NSP12 for replication in the upper respiratory tract, allowing markedly rapid transmissibility. This suggests that NSP12 P323L or P323L/G671S mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased RdRp complex stability and enzymatic activity, promoting efficient transmissibility.

Abstract: Summary
The Pallidin protein is a central subunit of a multimeric complex called biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC1) that regulates specific endosomal functions and has been linked to schizophrenia. We show here that downregulation of Pallidin and other members of BLOC1 in the surface glia, the Drosophila equivalent of the blood-brain barrier, reduces and delays nighttime sleep in a circadian-clock-dependent manner. In agreement with BLOC1 involvement in amino acid transport, downregulation of the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1)-like transporters JhI-21 and mnd, as well as of TOR (target of rapamycin) amino acid signaling, phenocopy Pallidin knockdown. Furthermore, supplementing food with leucine normalizes the sleep/wake phenotypes of Pallidin downregulation, and we identify a role for Pallidin in the subcellular trafficking of JhI-21. Finally, we provide evidence that Pallidin in surface glia is required for GABAergic neuronal activity. These data identify a BLOC1 function linking essential amino acid availability and GABAergic sleep/wake regulation.

Abstract: Summary
HIV persists in tissues during antiretroviral therapy (ART), but the relative contribution of different anatomical compartments to the viral reservoir in humans remains unknown. We performed an extensive characterization of HIV reservoirs in two men who donated their bodies to HIV cure research and who had been on suppressive ART for years. HIV DNA is detected in all tissues, with large variations across anatomical compartments and between participants. Intact HIV genomes represent 2% and 25% of all proviruses in the two participants and are mainly detected in secondary lymphoid organs, with the spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes harboring intact viral genomes in both individuals. Multiple copies of identical HIV genomes are found in all tissues, indicating that clonal expansions are common in anatomical sites. The majority (>85%) of these expanded clones are shared across multiple tissues. These findings suggest that infected cells expand, migrate, and possibly circulate between anatomical sites.

Abstract: Three-dimensional nanofiber scaffolds offer a promising method for simulating in vivo conditions within the laboratory. This study aims to investigate the influence of a bilayer amniochorionic membrane/nanofibrous fibroin scaffold on the differentiation of human menstrual blood mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MenSCs) into female germ cells. MenSCs were isolated and assigned to four culture groups: (i) MenSCs co-cultured with granulosa cells (GCs) using the scaffold (3D-T group), (ii) MenSCs using the scaffold alone (3D-C group), (iii) MenSCs co-cultured only with GCs (2D-T group), and (iv) MenSCs without co-culture or scaffold (2D-C group). Both MenSCs and GCs were independently cultured for two weeks before co-culturing was initiated. Flow cytometry was employed to characterize MenSCs based on positive markers (CD73, CD90, and CD105) and negative markers (CD45 and CD133). Additionally, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry were used to characterize the GCs. Differentiated MenSCs were analyzed using real-time PCR and immunostaining. The real-time PCR results demonstrated significantly higher levels of VASA expression in the 3D-T group compared to the 3D-C, 2D-T, and 2D-C groups. Similarly, the SCP3 mRNA level in the 3D-T group was notably elevated compared to the 3D-C, 2D-T, and 2D-C groups. Moreover, the expression of GDF9 was significantly higher in the 3D-T group when compared to the 3D-C, 2D-T, and 2D-C groups. Immunostaining results revealed a lack of signal for VASA, SCP3, or GDF9 markers in the 2D-T group, while some cells in the 3D-T group exhibited positive staining for all these proteins. These findings suggest that the combination of a bilayer amniochorionic membrane/nanofibrous fibroin scaffold with co-culturing GCs facilitates the differentiation of MenSCs into female germ cells.

Abstract: Summary
The microenvironment profoundly influences tumor initiation across numerous tissues but remains understudied in brain tumors. In the cerebellum, canonical Wnt signaling controlled by Norrin/Frizzled4 (Fzd4) activation in meningeal endothelial cells is a potent inhibitor of preneoplasia and tumor progression in mouse models of Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma (Shh-MB). Single-cell transcriptome profiling and phenotyping of the meninges indicate that Norrin/Frizzled4 sustains the activation of meningeal macrophages (mMΦs), characterized by Lyve1 and CXCL4 expression, during the critical preneoplastic period. Depleting mMΦs during this period enhances preneoplasia and tumorigenesis, phenocopying the effects of Norrin loss. The anti-tumorigenic function of mMΦs is derived from the expression of CXCL4, which counters CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in pre-tumor cells, thereby inhibiting cell-cycle progression and promoting migration away from the pre-tumor niche. These findings identify a pivotal role for mMΦs as key mediators in chemokine-regulated anti-cancer crosstalk between the stroma and pre-tumor cells in the control of MB initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) direct the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Here, we provide a composite multiscale structure of the yeast NPC, based on improved 3D density maps from cryogenic electron microscopy and AlphaFold2 models. Key features of the inner and outer rings were integrated into a comprehensive model. We resolved flexible connectors that tie together the core scaffold, along with equatorial transmembrane complexes and a lumenal ring that anchor this channel within the pore membrane. The organization of the nuclear double outer ring reveals an architecture that may be shared with ancestral NPCs. Additional connections between the core scaffold and the central transporter suggest that under certain conditions, a degree of local organization is present at the periphery of the transport machinery. These connectors may couple conformational changes in the scaffold to the central transporter to modulate transport. Collectively, this analysis provides insights into assembly, transport, and NPC evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy mitochondria are critical for reproduction. During aging, both reproductive fitness and mitochondrial homeostasis decline. Mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics are key factors in supporting mitochondrial homeostasis. However, how they are coupled to control reproductive health remains unclear. We report that mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP) metabolism acts through mitochondrial dynamics factors to regulate reproductive aging. We discovered that germline-only inactivation of GTP- but not ATP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) promotes reproductive longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We further identified an age-associated increase in mitochondrial clustering surrounding oocyte nuclei, which is attenuated by GTP-specific SCS inactivation. Germline-only induction of mitochondrial fission factors sufficiently promotes mitochondrial dispersion and reproductive longevity. Moreover, we discovered that bacterial inputs affect mtGTP levels and dynamics factors to modulate reproductive aging. These results demonstrate the significance of mtGTP metabolism in regulating oocyte mitochondrial homeostasis and reproductive longevity and identify mitochondrial fission induction as an effective strategy to improve reproductive health.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingolipids have key functions in membrane structure and cellular signaling. Ceramide is the central molecule of the sphingolipid metabolism and is generated by ceramide synthases (CerS) in the de novo pathway. Despite their critical function, mechanisms regulating CerS remain largely unknown. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we find that the small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) interacts specifically with CerS1 but not other CerS. Functionally, our data show that Hsp27 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of CerS1. Wild-type Hsp27, but not a mutant deficient in CerS1 binding, inhibits CerS1 activity. Additionally, silencing of Hsp27 enhances CerS1-generated ceramide accumulation in cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of Hsp27 modulates Hsp27-CerS1 interaction and CerS1 activity in acute stress-response conditions. Biologically, we show that Hsp27 knockdown impedes mitochondrial function and induces lethal mitophagy in a CerS1-dependent manner. Overall, we identify an important mode of CerS1 regulation and CerS1-mediated mitophagy through protein-protein interaction with Hsp27.

Abstract: Summary
Folding of newly synthesized proteins poses challenges for a functional proteome. Dedicated protein quality control (PQC) systems either promote the folding of nascent polypeptides at ribosomes or, if this fails, ensure their degradation. Although well studied for cytosolic protein biogenesis, it is not understood how these processes work for mitochondrially encoded proteins, key subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Here, we identify dedicated hubs in proximity to mitoribosomal tunnel exits coordinating mitochondrial protein biogenesis and quality control. Conserved prohibitin (PHB)/m-AAA protease supercomplexes and the availability of assembly chaperones determine the fate of newly synthesized proteins by molecular triaging. The localization of these competing activities in the vicinity of the mitoribosomal tunnel exit allows for a prompt decision on whether newly synthesized proteins are fed into OXPHOS assembly or are degraded.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) play a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid balance by storing and delivering lipids as needed. However, the intricate lipolytic pathways involved in LD turnover remain poorly described, hindering our comprehension of lipid catabolism and related disorders. Here, we show a function of the small GTPase ARL8B in mediating LD turnover in lysosomes. ARL8B-GDP localizes to LDs, while ARL8-GTP predominantly favors lysosomes. GDP binding induces a conformation with an exposed N-terminal amphipathic helix, enabling ARL8B to bind to LDs. By associating with LDs and lysosomes, and with its property to form a heterotypic complex, ARL8B mediates LD-lysosome contacts and efficient lipid transfer between these organelles. In human macrophages, this ARL8B-dependent LD turnover mechanism appears as the major lipolytic pathway. Our finding opens exciting possibilities for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying LD degradation and its potential implications for inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) drive associative learning to update the value of sensory cues, but their contribution to the assessment of sensory values outside the context of association remains largely unexplored. Here, we show in Drosophila that DANs in the mushroom body encode the innate value of odors and constantly update the current value by inducing plasticity during olfactory maneuver. Our connectome-based network model linking all the way from the olfactory neurons to DANs reproduces the characteristics of DAN responses, proposing a concrete circuit mechanism for computation. Downstream of DANs, odors alone induce value- and dopamine-dependent changes in the activity of mushroom body output neurons, which store the current value of odors. Consistent with this neural plasticity, specific sets of DANs bidirectionally modulate flies’ steering in a virtual olfactory environment. Thus, the DAN circuit known for discrete, associative learning also continuously updates odor values in a nonassociative manner.

Abstract: Skin infections by pathogenic microorganisms are a serious problem due to the potential of dissemination through the bloodstream to various organs causing toxic effects that may be up to mortality. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the most predominant Gram-negative bacterial species present globally with great attention for investigation. The current study is designed to investigate the possible role of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs), as well as natural products such as Trichoderma viride (T. viride) extract, Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) solution in the enhancement of wound healing process in the infected skin with E. coli. Ninety-six female rats were divided into 8 groups (12 animal/group): normal skin, wounded skin, wounded skin infected with E. coli, infected-wounded skin treated by ADSCs, infected-wounded skin treated by T. viride extract, infected-wounded skin treated by S. boulardii solution, infected-wounded skin treated a combination of treatments, infected-wounded skin treated by gentamicin. At day 21 animal weights and bacterial count were detected and compared. Animals were sacrificed and skin from various groups was investigated using a light microscope for sections stained by (hematoxylin eosin, Masson trichrome, and PCNA) as well as transmission electron microscopy. Pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, TNF- α, and IL-13), anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4), and antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) were assessed in various groups revealing that ADSCs lightly shift levels of these parameters in various rat groups to regular levels, while administration of T. viride extract, S. boulardii solution, their combination with ADSCs and gentamicin treatment drive the tested cytokines and enzymes to significant levels similar to a normal level where combination therapy gave the best result. The current findings revealed the possibility of using certain natural products as possible substitutes to regularly applied antibiotics with successive protective results in the wound infection model.
