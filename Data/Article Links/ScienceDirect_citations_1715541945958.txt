Abstract: Plant cytokinesis requires intense membrane trafficking and remodeling to form a specific membrane structure, the cell plate that will ultimately separate the daughter cells. The nature and the role of lipids involved in the formation of the cell plate remain unclear. Plant membranes are particularly rich in sphingolipids such as glucosyl-ceramides with long (16 carbons) or very long (24 carbons) acyl chains. We reveal here that inhibition of the synthesis of sphingolipids with very long acyl chains induces defective cell plates with persistent vesicular structures and large gaps. Golgi-derived vesicles carrying material toward the cell plate display longer vesicle–vesicle contact time and their cargos accumulate at the cell plate, suggesting membrane fusion and/or recycling defects. In vitro fusion experiments between artificial vesicles show that glycosphingolipids with very long acyl chains stimulate lipid bilayer fusion. Therefore we propose that the very long acyl chains of sphingolipids are essential structural determinants for vesicle dynamics and membrane fusion during cytokinesis.

Abstract: Obesity is often associated with abnormalities in cardiac morphology and function. This study tested the hypothesis that obesity-related cardiomyopathy is caused by impaired cardiac energetics. In a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we applied in vivo cardiac 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate cardiac energy status and function, respectively. The measurements were complemented by ex vivo determination of oxygen consumption in isolated cardiac mitochondria, the expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism, and markers of oxidative stress and calcium homeostasis. We also assessed whether HFD induced myocardial lipid accumulation using in vivo 1H MRS, and if this was associated with apoptosis and fibrosis. Twenty weeks of HFD feeding resulted in early stage cardiomyopathy, as indicated by diastolic dysfunction and increased left ventricular mass, without any effects on systolic function. In vivo cardiac phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio and ex vivo oxygen consumption in isolated cardiac mitochondria were not reduced after HFD feeding, suggesting that the diastolic dysfunction was not caused by impaired cardiac energetics. HFD feeding promoted mitochondrial adaptations for increased utilization of fatty acids, which was however not sufficient to prevent the accumulation of myocardial lipids and lipid intermediates. Myocardial lipid accumulation was associated with oxidative stress and fibrosis, but not apoptosis. Furthermore, HFD feeding strongly reduced the phosphorylation of phospholamban, a prominent regulator of cardiac calcium homeostasis and contractility. In conclusion, HFD-induced early stage cardiomyopathy in mice is associated with lipotoxicity-associated oxidative stress, fibrosis, and disturbed calcium homeostasis, rather than impaired cardiac energetics.

Abstract: The metal responsive element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) responds to changes in cellular zinc levels caused by zinc exposure or disruption of endogenous zinc homeostasis by heavy metals or oxygen-related stress. Here we report the functional characterization of a complete zebrafish MTF-1 in comparison with the previously identified isoform lacking the highly conserved cysteine-rich motif (Cys-X-Cys-Cys-X-Cys) found in all other vertebrate MTF-1 orthologs. In an effort to develop novel molecular tools, a constitutively nuclear dominant-negative MTF-1 (dnMTF-1) was generated as tool for inhibiting endogenous MTF-1 signaling. The in vivo efficacy of the dnMTF-1 was determined by microinjecting in vitro transcribed dnMTF-1 mRNA into zebrafish embryos (1–2 cell stage) followed by transcriptomic profiling using an Agilent 4x44K array on 28- and 36-hpf embryos. A total of 594 and 560 probes were identified as differentially expressed at 28hpf and 36hpf, respectively, with interesting overlaps between timepoints. The main categories of genes affected by the inhibition of MTF-1 signaling were: nuclear receptors and genes involved in stress signaling, neurogenesis, muscle development and contraction, eye development, and metal homeostasis, including novel observations in iron and heme homeostasis. Finally, we investigate both the transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor role of MTF-1 in potential novel target genes identified by transcriptomic profiling during early zebrafish development.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) induces COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation via S1P receptor 2 in renal mesangial cells,

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation in renal mesangial cells may provide potential therapeutic targets to treat inflammatory glomerular diseases. Thus, we evaluated the S1P-dependent signaling mechanisms which are responsible for enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation in rat mesangial cells under basal conditions. Furthermore, we investigated whether these mechanisms are operative in the presence of angiotensin II (Ang II) and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Treatment of rat and human mesangial cells with S1P led to concentration-dependent enhanced expression of COX-2. Pharmacological and molecular biology approaches revealed that the S1P-dependent increase of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression was mediated via activation of S1P receptor 2 (S1P2). Further, inhibition of Gi and p42/p44 MAPK signaling, both downstream of S1P2, abolished the S1P-induced COX-2 expression. In addition, S1P/S1P2-dependent upregulation of COX-2 led to significantly elevated PGE2 levels, which were further potentiated in the presence of Ang II and IL-1β. A functional consequence downstream of S1P/S1P2 signaling is mesangial cell migration that is stimulated by S1P. Interestingly, inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib and SC-236 completely abolished the migratory response. Overall, our results demonstrate that extracellular S1P induces COX-2 expression via activation of S1P2 and subsequent Gi and p42/p44 MAPK-dependent signaling in renal mesangial cells leading to enhanced PGE2 formation and cell migration that essentially requires COX-2. Thus, targeting S1P/S1P2 signaling pathways might be a novel strategy to treat renal inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: The acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) has been implicated in carcinogenesis and neuronal development. Acyl-CoA synthetases are essential enzymes of lipid metabolism, and ACSL4 is distinguished by its preference for arachidonic acid. Two human ACSL4 isoforms arising from differential splicing were analyzed by ectopic expression in COS cells. We found that the ACSL4_v1 variant localized to the inner side of the plasma membrane including microvilli, and was also present in the cytosol. ACSL4_v2 contains an additional N-terminal hydrophobic region; this isoform was located at the endoplasmic reticulum and on lipid droplets. A third isoform was designed de novo by appending a mitochondrial targeting signal. All three ACSL4 variants showed the same specific enzyme activity. Overexpression of the isoenzymes increased cellular uptake of arachidonate to the same degree, indicating that the metabolic trapping of fatty acids is independent of the subcellular localization. Remarkably, phospholipid metabolism was changed by ACSL4 expression. Labeling with arachidonate showed that the amount of newly synthesized phosphatidylinositol was increased by all three ACSL4 isoenzymes but not by ACSL1. This was dependent on the expression level and the localization of the ACSL4 isoform. We conclude that in our model system exogenous fatty acids are channeled preferentially towards phosphatidylinositol by ACSL4 overexpression. The differential localization of the endogenous isoenzymes may provide compartment specific precursors of this anionic phospholipid important for many signaling processes.

Abstract: In nematode, sperm activation (or spermiogenesis), a process in which the symmetric and non-motile spermatids transform into polarized and crawling spermatozoa, is critical for sperm cells to acquire fertilizing competence. SPE-8 dependent and SPE-8 independent pathways function redundantly during sperm activation in both males and hermaphrodites of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the downstream signaling for both pathways remains unclear. Here we show that calcium signaling and the MAPK cascade are required for both SPE-8 dependent and SPE-8 independent sperm activation, implying that both pathways share common downstream signaling components during sperm activation. We demonstrate that activation of the MAPK cascade is sufficient to activate spermatids derived from either wild-type or spe-8 group mutant males and that activation of the MAPK cascade bypasses the requirement of calcium signal to induce sperm activation, indicating that the MAPK cascade functions downstream of or parallel with the calcium signaling during sperm activation. Interestingly, the persistent activation of MAPK in activated spermatozoa inhibits Major Sperm Protein (MSP)-based cytoskeleton dynamics. We demonstrate that MAPK plays dual roles in promoting pseudopod extension during sperm activation but also blocking the MSP-based, amoeboid motility of the spermatozoa. Thus, though nematode sperm are crawling cells, morphologically distinct from flagellated sperm, and the molecular machinery for motility of amoeboid and flagellated sperm is different, both types of sperm might utilize conserved signaling pathways to modulate sperm maturation.

Abstract: Members of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are characterized by a C-terminal HECT domain that catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins and by N-terminal extensions of variable length and domain architecture that determine the substrate spectrum of a respective HECT E3. Since their discovery in 1995, it has become clear that deregulation of distinct HECT E3s plays an eminent role in human disease or disease-related processes including cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders, viral infections, and immune response. Thus, a detailed understanding of the structure–function aspects of HECT E3s as well as the identification and characterization of the substrates and regulators of HECT E3s is critical in developing new approaches in the treatment of respective diseases. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about mammalian HECT E3s, with a focus on their biological functions and roles in pathophysiology.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin–Proteasome System.

Abstract: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and its cleavage products regulate cell viability and NF-kB activity when expressed in neurons. PARP-1 cleavage generates a 24kDa (PARP-124) and an 89kDa fragment (PARP-189). Compared to WT (PARP-1WT), the expression of an uncleavable PARP-1 (PARP-1UNCL) or of PARP-124 conferred protection from oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) or OGD/restoration of oxygen and glucose (ROG) damage in vitro, whereas expression of PARP-189 was cytotoxic. Viability experiments were performed in SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line, as well as in rat primary cortical neurons. Following OGD, the higher viability in the presence of PARP-1UNCL or PARP-124 was not accompanied with decreased formation of poly(ADP-riboses) or higher NAD levels. PARP-1 is a known cofactor for NF-kB, hence we investigated whether PARP-1 cleavage influences the inflammatory response. All PARP-1 constructs mimicked PARP-1WT in regard to induction of NF-kB translocation into the nucleus and its increased activation during ischemic challenge. However, expression of PARP-189 construct induced significantly higher NF-kB activity than PARP-1WT; and the same was true for NF-kB-dependent iNOS promoter binding activity. At a protein level, PARP-1UNCL and PARP-124 decreased iNOS (and lower levels of iNOS transcript) and COX-2, and increased Bcl-xL. The increased levels of NF-kB and iNOS transcriptional activities, seen with cytotoxic PARP-189, were accompanied by higher protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS (and higher levels of INOS transcript) and lower protein expression of Bcl-xL. Taken together, these findings suggest that PARP-1 cleavage products may regulate cellular viability and inflammatory responses in opposing ways during in vitro models of “ischemia”.

Abstract: Clinical evidence suggests that statins reduce cancer incidence and mortality. However, there is lack of in vitro data to show the mechanism by which statins can reduce the malignancies of cancer cells. We used a human B lymphoma Daudi cells as a model and found that lovastatin inhibited, whereas exogenous cholesterol (Cho) stimulated, proliferation cell cycle progression in control Daudi cells, but not in the cells when transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channel was knocked down. Lovastatin decreased, whereas Cho increased, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) respectively by decreasing or increasing the expression of p47-phox and gp91-phox (NOX2). Reducing intracellular ROS with either a mimetic superoxide dismutase (TEMPOL) or an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) inhibited cell proliferation, particularly in Cho-treated cells. The effects of TEMPOL or apocynin were mimicked by inhibition of TRPC6 with SKF-96365. Lovastatin decreased TRPC6 expression and activity via a Cho-dependent mechanism, whereas Cho increased TRPC6 expression and activity via an ROS-dependent mechanism. Consistent with the fact that TRPC6 is a Ca2+-permeable channel, lovastatin decreased, but Cho increased, intracellular Ca2+ also via ROS. These data suggest that lovastatin inhibits malignant B cell proliferation by reducing membrane Cho, intracellular ROS, TRPC6 expression and activity, and intracellular Ca2+.

Abstract: Adipogenesis depends on growth factors controlling proliferation/differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Membrane binding and endocytosis of growth factors are often coupled to receptor activation and downstream signaling leading to specific cellular responses. The novel adipokine tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5a exhibits a growth factor-like effect on MSCs and pre-adipocytes and induces hyperplastic obesity in vivo. However its molecular interaction with pre-adipocytes remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate membrane interaction of TRAP and its endocytosis routes in pre-adipocytes. Confocal and/or electron microscopy were used to detect TRAP in untreated or TRAP 5a/b treated pre-adipocytes under conditions that allow or inhibit endocytosis in combination with co-staining of endocytotic vesicles. TRAP interaction with heparin/heparan sulfate was verified by gel filtration. It could be shown that TRAP 5a, but not 5b, binds to the membrane of pre-adipocytes where it co-localizes with heparin-sulfate proteoglycan glypican-4. Also in vitro, TRAP 5a exhibited affinity for both heparin and heparan sulfate with heparin inhibiting its enzyme activity. Upon caveolae-mediated endocytosis of saturating levels of TRAP 5a, TRAP 5a co-localized intracellularly with glypican-4 and late endosomal marker Rab-7 positive vesicles. The protein was also located in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) but did not co-localize with lysosomal marker LAMP-1. TRAP 5a endocytosis was also detectable in pre-osteoblasts, but not fibroblasts, embryonic MSCs or mature adipocytes. These results indicate that TRAP 5a exhibits binding to cell surface, endocytosis and affinity to glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) in pre-adipocyte and pre-osteoblast lineage cells in a manner similar to other heparin-binding growth factors.

Abstract: How mutations or dysfunction of CFTR may increase the risk of malignancies in various tissues remains an open question. Here we report the interaction between CFTR and an adherens junction molecule, AF-6/afadin, and its involvement in the development of colon cancer. We have found that CFTR and AF-6/afadin are co-localized at the cell–cell contacts and physically interact with each other in colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of CFTR results in reduced epithelial tightness and enhanced malignancies, with increased degradation and reduced stability of AF-6/afadin protein. The enhanced invasive phenotype of CFTR-knockdown cells can be completely reversed by either AF-6/afadin over-expression or ERK inhibitor, indicating the involvement of AF-6/MAPK pathway. More interestingly, the expression levels of CFTR and AF-6/afadin are significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues and lower expression of CFTR and/or AF-6/afadin is correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients. The present study has revealed a previously unrecognized interaction between CFTR and AF-6/afadin that is involved in the pathogenesis of colon cancer and indicated the potential of the two as novel markers of metastasis and prognostic predictors for human colon cancer.

Abstract: Filamin A (FlnA) is a ubiquitous actin binding protein which anchors various transmembrane proteins to the cell cytoskeleton and provides a scaffold to many cytoplasmic signaling proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling in response to mechanical stress and cytokines stimulation. Although the vast majority of FlnA binding partners interact with the carboxy-terminal immunoglobulin like (Igl) repeats of FlnA, little is known on the role of the amino-N-terminal repeats. Here, using cardiac mitral valvular dystrophy associated FlnA–G288R and P637Q mutations located in the N-terminal Igl repeat 1 and 4 respectively as a model, we identified a new role of FlnA N-terminal repeats in small Rho-GTPases regulation. Using FlnA-deficient melanoma and HT1080 cell lines as expression systems we showed that FlnA mutations reduce cell spreading and migration capacities. Furthermore, we defined a signaling network in which FlnA mutations alter the balance between RhoA and Rac1 GTPases activities in favor of RhoA and provided evidences for a role of the Rac1 specific GTPase activating protein FilGAP in this process. Together our work ascribed a new role to the N-terminal repeats of FlnA in Small GTPases regulation and supports a conceptual framework for the role of FlnA mutations in cardiac valve diseases centered around signaling molecules regulating cellular actin cytoskeleton in response to mechanical stress.

Abstract: Posttranslational modifications in the form of covalently attached proteins like ubiquitin (Ub), were long considered an exclusive feature of eukaryotic organisms. The discovery of pupylation, the modification of lysine residues with a prokaryotic, ubiquitin-like protein (Pup), demonstrated that certain bacteria use a tagging pathway functionally related to ubiquitination in order to target proteins for proteasomal degradation. However, functional analogies do not translate into structural or mechanistic relatedness. Bacterial Pup, unlike eukaryotic Ub, does not adopt a β-grasp fold, but is intrinsically disordered. Furthermore, isopeptide bond formation in the pupylation process is carried out by enzymes evolutionary descendent from glutamine synthetases. While in eukaryotes, the proteasome is the main energy-dependent protein degradation machine, bacterial proteasomes exist in addition to other architecturally related degradation complexes, and their specific role along with the role of pupylation is still poorly understood. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the Pup–proteasome system contributes to pathogenicity by supporting the bacterium's persistence within host macrophages. Here, we describe the mechanism and structural framework of pupylation and the targeting of pupylated proteins to the proteasome complex. Particular attention is given to the comparison of the bacterial Pup–proteasome system and the eukaryotic ubiquitin–proteasome system. Furthermore, the involvement of pupylation and proteasomal degradation in Mtb pathogenesis is discussed together with efforts to establish the Pup–proteasome system as a drug target. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin–Proteasome System. Guest Editors: Thomas Sommer and Dieter H. Wolf.

Abstract: Considering membranes and membrane components as possible pacemakers of the main processes taking place inside mitochondria, changes in phospholipids or fatty acids could play a central role linking different mechanisms involved in cumulative damage to cell molecules and dysfunction during periods of high stress, such as rapid growth and aging. Changes affecting either lipid class or fatty acid compositions could affect phospholipid and membrane properties and alter mitochondrial function and cell viability. In the present study, mitochondrial oxidative status and mitochondrial membrane phospholipid compositions were analyzed throughout the life-cycle of zebrafish. TBARS content significantly increased in 18-month-old fish while aconitase activity decreased in 24-month-old fish, which have been related with oxidative damage to molecules. Mitochondria-specific superoxide dismutase decreased in 24-month-old animals although this change was not statistically significant. Age affected both mitochondrial phospholipid content and the peroxidation index of most phospholipid classes suggesting that oxidative damage to mitochondrial lipids was occurring.

Abstract: Elmo is an evolutionarily conserved mammalian ortholog of Caenorhabditis elegans CED-12 with proposed roles during the removal of apoptotic cells, cell migration, neurite outgrowth, and myoblast fusion (Katoh and Negishi (2003) [1], Park and Tosello (2007) [2], Grimsley et al. (2004) [3], Hamoud et al. (2014) [4]). Elmo mediates these cellular processes by interacting with various proteins located in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, and by modulating their activities although it has no intrinsic catalytic activity (Park and Tosello (2007) [2], Hamoud et al. (2014) [4], Li et al. (2013) [5], Margaron, Fradet and Cote (2013) [6], and Mauldin et al. (2013)[7]). Because there are a limited number of proteins known to interact with Elmo, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Elmo1 as bait to identify Elmo1-interacting proteins and to evaluate their mode of regulation. Arhgef16 was one of the proteins identified through the screen and subsequent analyses revealed that Arhgef16 interacted with Elmo1 in mammalian cells as well. Expression of Arhgef16 in phagocytes promoted engulfment of apoptotic cells, and engulfment mediated by Arhgef16 increased synergistically in the presence of Elmo1 but was abrogated in the absence of Elmo1. In addition, Arhgef16-mediated removal of apoptotic cells was dependent on RhoG, but independent of Dock1. Taken together, this study suggests that the newly identified Elmo1-interacting protein, Arhgef16, functions synergistically with Elmo1 to promote clearance of apoptotic cells in a RhoG-dependent and Dock1-independent manner.

Altered leukotriene B4 metabolism in CYP4F18-deficient mice does not impact inflammation following renal ischemia,

Abstract: Inflammatory responses to infection and injury must be restrained and negatively regulated to minimize damage to host tissue. One proposed mechanism involves enzymatic inactivation of the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4, but it is difficult to dissect the roles of various metabolic enzymes and pathways. A primary candidate for a regulatory pathway is omega oxidation of leukotriene B4 in neutrophils, presumptively by CYP4F3A in humans and CYP4F18 in mice. This pathway generates ω, ω-1, and ω-2 hydroxylated products of leukotriene B4, depending on species. We created mouse models targeting exons 8 and 9 of the Cyp4f18 allele that allows both conventional and conditional knockouts of Cyp4f18. Neutrophils from wild-type mice convert leukotriene B4 to 19-hydroxy leukotriene B4, and to a lesser extent 18-hydroxy leukotriene B4, whereas these products were not detected in neutrophils from conventional Cyp4f18 knockouts. A mouse model of renal ischemia–reperfusion injury was used to investigate the consequences of loss of CYP4F18 in vivo. There were no significant changes in infiltration of neutrophils and other leukocytes into kidney tissue as determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, or renal injury as assessed by histological scoring and measurement of blood urea nitrogen. It is concluded that CYP4F18 is necessary for omega oxidation of leukotriene B4 in neutrophils, and is not compensated by other CYP enzymes, but loss of this metabolic pathway is not sufficient to impact inflammation and injury following renal ischemia–reperfusion in mice.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette transporters are a large family (~48 genes divided into seven families A–G) of proteins that utilize the energy of ATP-hydrolysis to pump substrates across lipid bilayers against a concentration gradient. The ABC “A” subfamily is comprised of 13 members and transport sterols, phospholipids and bile acids. ABCA2 is the most abundant ABC transporter in human and rodent brain with highest expression in oligodendrocytes, although it is also expressed in neurons. Several groups have studied a possible connection between ABCA2 and Alzheimer's disease as well as early atherosclerosis. ABCA2 expression levels have been associated with changes in cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism. In this paper, we hypothesized that ABCA2 expression level may regulate esterification of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol by modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. ABCA2 overexpression in N2a neuroblastoma cells was associated with an altered bilayer distribution of the sphingolipid ceramide that inhibited acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and cholesterol esterification. In contrast, depletion of endogenous ABCA2 in the rat schwannoma cell line D6P2T increased esterification of plasma membrane cholesterol following treatment with exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase. These findings suggest that control of ABCA2 expression level may be a key locus of regulation for esterification of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol through modulation of sphingolipid metabolism.

Abstract: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found to be effective inhibitors of cell signaling in numerous contexts, and we find that acute addition of micromolar PUFAs such as linoleic acid effectively inhibit of Ca2+ responses in mast cells stimulated by antigen-mediated crosslinking of FcεRI or by the SERCA pump inhibitor, thapsigargin. In contrast, the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid, with the same carbon chain length as linoleic acid does not inhibit these responses. Consistent with this inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), linoleic acid inhibits antigen-stimulated granule exocytosis to a similar extent. Using the fluorescently labeled plasma membrane Ca2+ channel protein, AcGFP–Orai1, together with the labeled ER Ca2+ sensor protein, STIM1–mRFP, we monitor stimulated coupling of these proteins that is essential for SOCE with a novel spectrofluorimetric resonance energy transfer method. We find effective inhibition of this stimulated coupling by linoleic acid that accounts for the inhibition of SOCE. Moreover, we find that linoleic acid induces some STIM1–STIM1 association, while inhibiting stimulated STIM1 oligomerization that precedes STIM1–Orai1 coupling. We hypothesize that linoleic acid and related PUFAs inhibit STIM1–Orai1 coupling by a mechanism that involves perturbation of ER membrane structure, possibly by disrupting electrostatic interactions important in STIM1 oligomerization.

Abstract: α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) can bind oleic acid (OA) to form HAMLET-like complexes, which exhibited highly selective anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Considering the structural similarity to α-LA, we conjectured that lactoferrin (LF) could also bind OA to obtain a complex with anti-tumor activity. In this study, LF–OA was prepared and its activity and structural changes were compared with α-LA–OA. The anti-tumor activity was evaluated by methylene blue assay, while the apoptosis mechanism was analyzed using flow cytometry and Western blot. Structural changes of LF–OA were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The interactions of OA with LF and α-LA were evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). LF–OA was obtained by heat-treatment at pH8.0 with LD50 of 4.88, 4.95 and 4.62μM for HepG2, HT29, and MCF-7 cells, respectively, all of which were 10 times higher than those of α-LA–OA. Similar to HAMLET, LF–OA induced apoptosis in tumor cells through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated pathways. Exposure of tryptophan residues and the hydrophobic regions as well as the loss of tertiary structure were observed in LF–OA. Besides these similarities, LF showed different secondary structure changes when compared with α-LA, with a decrease of α-helix and β-turn and an increase of β-sheet and random coil. ITC results showed that there was a higher binding number of OA to LF than to α-LA, while both of the proteins interacted with OA through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. This study provides a theoretical basis for further exploration of protein–OA complexes.

Abstract: Modulation of the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway may provide a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the present study, we evaluated a novel 26-amino acid apolipoprotein mimetic peptide (ATI-5261) designed from the carboxyl terminal of apoE, in its ability to mimic apoA-I functionality in RCT in vitro. Our data shows that nascent HDL-like (nHDL) particles generated by incubating cells over-expressing ABCA1 with ATI-5261 increase the rate of specific ABCA1 dependent lipid efflux, with high affinity interactions with ABCA1. We also show that these nHDL particles interact with membrane micro-domains in a manner similar to nHDL apoA-I. These nHDL particles then interact with the ABCG1 transporter and are remodeled by plasma HDL-modulating enzymes. Finally, we show that these mature HDL-like particles are taken up by SR-BI for cholesterol delivery to liver cells. This ATI-5621-mediated process mimics apoA-I and may provide a means to prevent cholesterol accumulation in the artery wall. In this study, we propose an integrative physiology approach of HDL biogenesis with the synthetic peptide ATI-5261. These experiments provide new insights for potential therapeutic use of apolipoprotein mimetic peptides.

Abstract: Cytosolic-free Ca2+ plays a crucial role in blood platelet function and is essential for thrombosis and hemostasis. Therefore, cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration is tightly regulated in this cell. TRPC6 is expressed in platelets, and an important role for this Ca2+ channel in Ca2+ homeostasis has been reported in other cell types. The aim of this work is to study the function of TRPC6 in platelet Ca2+ homeostasis. The absence of TRPC6 resulted in an 18.73% decreased basal [Ca2+]c in resting platelets as compared to control cells. Further analysis confirmed a similar Ca2+ accumulation in wild-type and TRPC6-deficient mice; however, passive Ca2+ leak rates from agonist-sensitive intracellular stores were significantly decreased in TRPC6-deficient platelets. Biotinylation studies indicated the presence of an intracellular TRPC6 population, and subcellular fractionation indicated their presence on endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Moreover, the presence of intracellular calcium release in platelets stimulated with 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol further suggested a functional TRPC6 population located on the intracellular membranes surrounding calcium stores. However, coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed the absence of STIM1–TRPC6 interactions in resting conditions. This findings together with the absence of extracellular Mn2+ entry in resting wild-type platelets indicate that the plasma membrane TRPC6 fraction does not play a significant role in the maintenance of basal [Ca2+]c in mouse platelets. Our results suggest an active participation of the intracellular TRPC6 fraction as a regulator of basal [Ca2+]c, controlling the passive Ca2+ leak rate from agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in resting platelets.

Abstract: Mycobacteria use type VII secretion (T7S) systems to secrete proteins across their complex cell envelope. Pathogenic mycobacteria, such as the notorious pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have up to five of these secretion systems, named ESX-1 to ESX-5. At least three of these secretion systems are essential for mycobacterial virulence and/or viability. Elucidating T7S is therefore essential to understand the success of M. tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacteria as pathogens, and could be instrumental to identify novel targets for drug- and vaccine-development. Recently, significant progress has been achieved in the identification of T7S substrates and a general secretion motif. In addition, a start has been made with unraveling the mechanism of secretion and the structural analysis of the different subunits. This review summarizes these recent findings, which are incorporated in a working model of this complex machinery.

Abstract: The pharmacological modulation of putative renoprotective factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and HIF-1α-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in the kidney has therapeutic interest. In human renal proximal tubular HK2 cells, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) up-regulates HIF-1α and VEGF-A through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent up-regulation of retinoic acid receptor-β (RARβ). Here we studied the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 and p38 and their target kinase, mitogen- and stress activated kinase-1 (MSK1), in the signaling cascade. Treatment of HK2 cells with PGE2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR, the three studied kinases and the histone H3 (Ser10) at the RARβ gene promoter (the latter has been proposed as a molecular signature of the activated RARβ gene promoter). Prevention of the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK or MSK1 is by incubating, respectively, with AG1478, PD98059, SB203580 or H89 allowed to elucidate the precise phosphorylation order in the signaling cascade triggered by PGE2: first, EGFR; then, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and, finally, MSK1. Phosphorylation of MSK1 led to that of Ser10 in histone H3 and to activation of RARβ gene transcription (and the consequent increase in the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF-A), which was suppressed by H89 or by transfecting cells with a vector encoding for a dominant-negative mutant of MSK1. These results highlight the relevance of MSK1 in the up-regulation of RARβ by PGE2. They also may contribute to new therapeutic approaches based upon the pharmacological control of HIF-1α/VEGF-A in the proximal tubule through the modulation of the PGE2/EGFR/MAPK/MSK1/RARβ pathway.

Abstract: Ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) null mice cannot synthesize very-long acyl chain (C22–C24) ceramides resulting in significant alterations in the acyl chain composition of sphingolipids. We now demonstrate that hepatic triacylglycerol (TG) levels are reduced in the liver but not in the adipose tissue or skeletal muscle of the CerS2 null mouse, both before and after feeding with a high fat diet (HFD), where no weight gain was observed and large hepatic nodules appeared. Uptake of both BODIPY-palmitate and [3H]-palmitate was also abrogated in the hepatocytes and liver. The role of a number of key proteins involved in fatty acid uptake was examined, including FATP5, CD36/FAT, FABPpm and cytoplasmic FABP1. Levels of FATP5 and FABP1 were decreased in the CerS2 null mouse liver, whereas CD36/FAT levels were significantly elevated and CD36/FAT was also mislocalized upon insulin treatment. Moreover, treatment of hepatocytes with C22–C24-ceramides down-regulated CD36/FAT levels. Infection of CerS2 null mice with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-CerS2 restored normal TG levels and corrected the mislocalization of CD36/FAT, but had no effect on the intracellular localization or levels of FATP5 or FABP1. Together, these results demonstrate that hepatic fatty acid uptake via CD36/FAT can be regulated by altering the acyl chain composition of sphingolipids.

Abstract: It is known that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression is increased in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, but the role of PP2A in adipogenesis as well as obesity remains to be addressed. In this study, the role of PP2A in adipogenesis was explored. Preadipocytes were treated with okadaic acid (OA) during adipogenesis and the degree of adipogenesis was determined. The OA treatment blocked adipogenesis at the early time of adipogenesis, but not at the late time. In the early time of adipogenesis, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) activation is preceded by the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors including PPARγ and C/EBPα, which function at the late time of adipogenesis, and then C/EBPβ is degraded. However, the inhibition of PP2A by OA treatment sustained phosphorylation of C/EBPβ and delayed its degradation. In turn, PPARγ and C/EBPα activation was altered. Among the various regulatory B56 subunits consisting of PP2A holoenzyme, B56δ was directly bound to C/EBPβ and was responsible for the dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ by PP2A. Taken together, these findings suggest that the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ after hormonal induction has to be inactivated by PP2A containing B56δ at the early time of adipogenesis to allow the completion of adipogenesis.

Abstract: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 and 4 (TIM-1 and -4) proteins serve as phosphatidylserine receptors to engulf apoptotic cells. Here we show that human TIM-1 and TIM-4 proteins are targets of A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM)-mediated ectodomain shedding resulting in soluble forms of TIM-1 and TIM-4. We identified ADAM10 and ADAM17 as major sheddases of TIM-1 and TIM-4 as shown by protease-specific inhibitors, the ADAM10 prodomain, siRNA and ADAM10/ADAM17 deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). TIM-1 and TIM-4 lacking the intracellular domain were efficiently cleaved after ionomycin- and PMA-treatment, indicating that the intracellular domain was not necessary for ectodomain shedding. Soluble TIM-1 and -4 were able to bind to phosphatidylserine, suggesting that soluble TIM-1 and -4 might act as negative regulators of cellular TIM-1 and -4. In summary, we describe TIM-1 and TIM-4 as novel targets for ADAM10- and ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor, and its treatments require more effective therapeutic approaches. Paclitaxel has a broad range of antitumor activities, including apoptosis-inducing effects. However, the majority of tumors in patients with advanced cancer eventually develop chemoresistance. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein that modulates the invasiveness of certain human cancer cells by binding to integrins. However, the effect of CTGF in paclitaxel-mediated chemotherapy is unknown. Here, we report that the expression of CTGF in osteosarcoma patients was significantly higher than that of the CTGF expression in normal bone tissues. Overexpression of CTGF increased the resistance to paclitaxel-mediated cell apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of CTGF expression by CTGF shRNA increased the chemotherapeutic effect of paclitaxel. In addition, CTGF increased resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through upregulation of survivin expression. Moreover, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway mediated paclitaxel-increased chemoresistance and survivin expression. In a mouse xenograft model, overexpression of CTGF promoted resistance to paclitaxel. In contrast, knockdown of CTGF expression increased the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel in this model. In conclusion, our data indicate that CTGF might be a critical oncogene of human osteosarcoma involved in resistance to paclitaxel treatment.

Abstract: The only known structural protein required for formation of myelin, produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, is myelin basic protein (MBP). This peripheral membrane protein has different developmentally-regulated isoforms, generated by alternative splicing. The isoforms are targeted to distinct subcellular locations, which is governed by the presence or absence of exon-II, although their functional expression is often less clear. Here, we investigated the role of exon-II-containing MBP isoforms and their link with cell proliferation. Live-cell imaging and FRAP analysis revealed a dynamic nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the exon-II-containing postnatal 21.5-kDa MBP isoform upon mitogenic modulation. Its nuclear export was blocked upon treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear protein export. Next to the postnatal MBP isoforms, embryonic exon-II-containing MBP (e-MBP) is expressed in primary (immature) oligodendrocytes. The e-MBP isoform is exclusively present in OLN-93 cells, a rat-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line, and interestingly, also in several non-CNS cell lines. As seen for postnatal MBPs, a similar nucleocytoplasmic translocation upon mitogenic modulation was observed for e-MBP. Thus, upon serum deprivation, e-MBP was excluded from the nucleus, whereas re-addition of serum re-established its nuclear localization, with a concomitant increase in proliferation. Knockdown of MBP by shRNA confirmed a role for e-MBP in OLN-93 proliferation, whereas the absence of e-MBP similarly reduced the proliferative capacity of non-CNS cell lines. Thus, exon-II-containing MBP isoforms may regulate cell proliferation via a mechanism that relies on their dynamic nuclear import and export, which is not restricted to the oligodendrocyte lineage.

Abstract: Atmospheric pressure gas plasma (AGP) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce apoptosis in cultured cancer cells. The majority of cancer cells develop a ROS-scavenging anti-oxidant system regulated by Nrf2, which confers resistance to ROS-mediated cancer cell death. Generation of ROS is involved in the AGP-induced cancer cell death of several colorectal cancer cells (Caco2, HCT116 and SW480) by activation of ASK1-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway without affecting control cells (human colonic sub-epithelial myofibroblasts; CO18, human fetal lung fibroblast; MRC5 and fetal human colon; FHC). However, the identity of an oxidase participating in AGP-induced cancer cell death is unknown. Here, we report that AGP up-regulates the expression of Nox2 (NADPH oxidase) to produce ROS. RNA interference designed to target Nox2 effectively inhibits the AGP-induced ROS production and cancer cell death. In some cases both colorectal cancer HT29 and control cells showed resistance to AGP treatment. Compared to AGP-sensitive Caco2 cells, HT29 cells show a higher basal level of the anti-oxidant system transcriptional regulator Nrf2 and its target protein sulfiredoxin (Srx) which are involved in cellular redox homeostasis. Silencing of both Nrf2 and Srx sensitized HT29 cells, leads to ROS overproduction and decreased cell viability. This indicates that in HT29 cells, Nrf2/Srx axis is a protective factor against AGP-induced oxidative stress. The inhibition of Nrf2/Srx signaling should be considered as a central target in drug-resistant colorectal cancer treatments.

Abstract: The S447X polymorphism in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which shortens LPL by two amino acids, is associated with low plasma triglyceride levels and reduced risk for coronary heart disease. S447X carriers have higher LPL levels in the pre- and post-heparin plasma, raising the possibility that the S447X polymorphism leads to higher LPL levels within capillaries. One potential explanation for increased amounts of LPL in capillaries would be more avid binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 (the protein that binds LPL dimers and shuttles them to the capillary lumen). This explanation seems plausible because sequences within the carboxyl terminus of LPL are known to mediate LPL binding to GPIHBP1. To assess the impact of the S447X polymorphism on LPL binding to GPIHBP1, we compared the ability of internally tagged versions of wild-type LPL (WT-LPL) and S447X-LPL to bind to GPIHBP1 in both cell-based and cell-free binding assays. In the cell-based assay, we compared the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 on the surface of cultured cells. This assay revealed no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1. In the cell-free assay, we compared the binding of internally tagged WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to soluble GPIHBP1 immobilized on agarose beads. Again, no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 were observed. We conclude that increased binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 is unlikely to be the explanation for more efficient lipolysis and lower plasma triglyceride levels in S447X carriers.

Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) regulates PLIN5 expression and intracellular lipid droplet formation in the liver,

Abstract: Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) belongs to the superfamily of lipocalins and plays critical roles in the control of cellular homeostasis during inflammation and in responses to cellular stress or injury. In the liver, LCN2 triggers protective effects following acute or chronic injury, and its expression is a reliable indicator of liver damage. However, little is known about LCN2's functions in the homeostasis and metabolism of hepatic lipids or in the development of steatosis. In this study, we fed wild type (WT) and LCN2-deficient (Lcn2−/−) mice a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet as a nutritional model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and compared intrahepatic lipid accumulation, lipid droplet formation, mitochondrial content, and expression of the Perilipin proteins that regulate cellular lipid metabolism. We found that Lcn2−/− mice fed an MCD diet accumulated more lipids in the liver than WT controls, and that the basal expression of the lipid droplet coat protein Perilipin 5 (PLIN5, also known as OXPAT) was significantly reduced in these animals. Similarly, the overexpression of LCN2 and PLIN5 were also found in animals that were fed with a high fat diet. Furthermore, the loss of LCN2 and/or PLIN5 in hepatocytes prevented normal intracellular lipid droplet formation both in vitro and in vivo. Restoration of LCN2 in Lcn2−/− primary hepatocytes by either transfection or adenoviral vector infection induced PLIN5 expression and restored proper lipid droplet formation. Our data indicate that LCN2 is a key modulator of hepatic lipid homeostasis that controls the formation of intracellular lipid droplets by regulating PLIN5 expression. LCN2 may therefore represent a novel therapeutic drug target for the treatment of liver diseases associated with elevated fat accumulation and steatosis.

Non-classical testosterone signaling is mediated by a G-protein-coupled receptor interacting with Gnα11,

Abstract: Testosterone is known to mediate its effects by two different mechanisms of action. In the so-called “classical” pathway testosterone binds to cytosolic androgen receptors (AR), which essentially function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Once activated, these receptors bind to DNA and activate the expression of target genes. In the “non-classical” pathway, the steroid hormone binds to receptors associated with the plasma membrane and induces signaling cascades mediated through activation of Erk1/2. The precise nature of the membrane-associated AR, however, remains controversial. Although some assume that the membrane and cytosolic AR are identical, others propose that the AR of the membrane is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). To evaluate these two possibilities we first searched for testosterone-induced signaling cascades in the spermatogenic cell line GC-2. Testosterone was found to cause phosphorylation (activation) of Erk1/2, CREB, and ATF-1, consistent with its non-classical mechanism of action. Silencing of AR expression by means of siRNA did not influence testosterone-induced activation of Erk1/2, CREB, or ATF-1, indicating that this pathway is not activated by the classical cytosolic/nuclear AR. In contrast, when the expression of the G-protein Gnα11 is suppressed, the activation of these signaling molecules is abolished, suggesting that these responses are elicited through a membrane-bound GPCR. The results presented here and the identification of the testosterone-specific GPCR in future investigations will help to reveal and characterize new testosterone-mediated mechanisms associated not only with fertility and reproduction but perhaps also with other physiological processes.

Abstract: The Cpx envelope stress response (ESR) has been linked to proteins that are integrated into and secreted across the inner membrane for several decades. Initial studies of the cpx locus linked it to alterations in the protein content of both the inner and outer membrane, together with changes in proton motive driven transport and conjugation. Since the mid 1990s, the predominant view of the Cpx envelope stress response has been that it serves to detect and respond to secreted, misfolded proteins in the periplasm. Recent studies in Escherichia coli and other Gram negative organisms highlight a role for the Cpx ESR in specifically responding to perturbations that occur at the inner membrane (IM). It is clear that Cpx adaptation involves a broad suite of changes that encompass many functions in addition to protein folding. Interestingly, recent studies have refocused attention on Cpx-regulated phenotypes that were initially published over 30years ago, including antibiotic resistance and transport across the IM. In this review I will focus on the insights and models that have arisen from recent studies and that may help explain some of the originally published Cpx phenotypes. Although the molecular nature of the inducing signal for the Cpx ESR remains enigmatic, recently solved structures of signaling proteins are yielding testable models concerning the molecular mechanisms behind signaling. The identification of connections between the Cpx ESR and other stress responses in the cell reveals a complex web of interactions that involves Cpx-regulated expression of other regulators as well as small proteins and sRNAs.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts are important regulators of inflammatory and immune responses in the skin. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the interaction between two key players in inflammation, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in normal human fibroblasts in the context of inflammation, fibrosis and cell migration. We demonstrate that TLR2 ligation strongly enhances the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. S1P significantly induces pro-inflammatory cytokines time- and concentration-dependently via S1P receptor (S1PR)2 and S1PR3. The TLR2/1 agonist Pam3CSK4 and S1P (>1μM) or TGF-β markedly upregulate IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Pam3CSK4 and S1P alone promote myofibroblast differentiation as assessed by significant increases of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I expression. Importantly, costimulation with S1P (>1μM) induces differentiation into myofibroblasts. In contrast, Pam3CSK4 and low S1P concentrations (<1μM) accelerate cell migration. These results suggest that TLR2/1 signaling and S1P cooperate in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and myofibroblast differentiation and promote cell migration of skin fibroblasts in a S1P-concentration dependent manner. Our findings provide significant insights into how infectious stimuli or danger signals and sphingolipids contribute to dermal inflammation which may be relevant for skin tissue repair after injury or disease.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ with a vital function in small mammals and potential as metabolic drug target in humans. By using high-resolution LC-tandem-mass spectrometry, we quantified 329 lipid species from 17 (sub)classes and identified the fatty acid composition of all phospholipids from BAT and subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) from female and male mice. Phospholipids and free fatty acids were higher in BAT, while DAG and TAG levels were higher in WAT. A set of phospholipids dominated by the residue docosahexaenoic acid, which influences membrane fluidity, showed the highest specificity for BAT. We additionally detected major sex-specific differences between the BAT lipid profiles, while samples from the different WAT depots were comparatively similar. Female BAT contained less triacylglycerol and more phospholipids rich in arachidonic and stearic acid whereas another set of fatty acid residues that included linoleic and palmitic acid prevailed in males. These differences in phospholipid fatty acid composition could greatly affect mitochondrial membranes and other cellular organelles and thereby regulate the function of BAT in a sex-specific manner.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their biological activity includes a membrane binding process whose molecular details are not completely understood. The mechanism of enzyme–membrane interactions is thought to involve conformational changes at the level of the protein tertiary structure, and the extent of such alterations depends on the degree of structural flexibility of the different LOX isoforms. In this study, we have tested the resilience properties of a plant and a mammalian LOX, by using high pressure fluorescence measurements at different temperatures. The binding of LOXs to the lipid bilayer has been characterized using both large and giant unilamellar vesicles and electron transfer particles (inner mitochondrial membranes) as model membranes. The data indicate that the degree of LOXs' flexibility is strictly dependent on the two distinct N- and C-terminal domains that characterize the 3D structure of these enzymes. Furthermore, they demonstrate that increasing the rigidity of protein scaffolding by the presence of an active site ligand impairs the membrane binding ability of LOXs. These findings provide evidence that the amphitropic nature of LOXs is finely tuned by the interaction of the substrate with the residues of the active site, suggesting new strategies for the design of enzyme inhibitors.

Abstract: Plasmodium falciparum takes advantage of two broadly defined alternate invasion pathways when infecting human erythrocytes: one that depends on and the other that is independent of host sialic acid residues on the erythrocyte surface. Within the sialic acid-dependent (SAD) and sialic acid-independent (SAID) invasion pathways, several alternate host receptors are used by P. falciparum based on its particular invasion phenotype. Earlier, we reported that two putative extracellular regions of human erythrocyte band 3 termed 5C and 6A function as host invasion receptor segments binding parasite proteins MSP1 and MSP9 via a SAID mechanism. In this study, we developed two mono-specific anti-peptide chicken IgY antibodies to demonstrate that the 5C and 6A regions of band 3 are exposed on the surface of human erythrocytes. These antibodies inhibited erythrocyte invasion by the P. falciparum 3D7 and 7G8 strains (SAID invasion phenotype), and the blocking effect was enhanced in sialic acid-depleted erythrocytes. In contrast, the IgY antibodies had only a marginal inhibitory effect on FCR3 and Dd2 strains (SAD invasion phenotype). A direct biochemical interaction between erythrocyte band 3 epitopes and parasite RhopH3, identified by the yeast two-hybrid screen, was established. RhopH3 formed a complex with MSP119 and the 5ABC region of band 3, and a recombinant segment of RhopH3 inhibited parasite invasion in human erythrocytes. Together, these findings provide evidence that erythrocyte band 3 functions as a major host invasion receptor in the SAID invasion pathway by assembling a multi-protein complex composed of parasite ligands RhopH3 and MSP1.

Abstract: We have studied the membrane transport of the chimeric precursor protein 16/33, which is composed of the Tat1-specific transport signal of OEC16 and the Sec passenger protein OEC33, both subunits of the oxygen-evolving system associated with photosystem II. Protein transport experiments performed with isolated pea thylakoids show that the 16/33 chimera is transported in a strictly Tat-dependent manner into the thylakoid vesicles yielding mature OEC33 (mOEC33) in two different topologies. One fraction accumulates in the thylakoid lumen and is thus resistant to externally added protease. A second fraction is arrested during transport in an N-in/C-out topology within the membrane. Chase experiments demonstrate that this membrane-arrested mOEC33 moiety does not represent a translocation intermediate but instead an alternative end product of the transport process. Transport arrest of mOEC33, which is embedded in the membrane with a mildly hydrophobic protein segment, requires more than 26 additional and predominantly hydrophilic residues C-terminal of the membrane-embedded segment. Furthermore, it is stimulated by mutations which potentially affect the conformation of mOEC33 suggesting that at least partial folding of the passenger protein is required for complete membrane translocation.

Abstract: Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) such as zoledronic acid (ZOL) are the gold standard treatment for diseases of excessive bone resorption. N-BPs inactivate osteoclasts via inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), thereby preventing the prenylation of essential small GTPases. Not all patients respond to N-BP therapy to the same extent, and some patients, for example with tumour-associated bone disease or Paget's disease, appear to develop resistance to N-BPs. The extent to which upregulation of FPPS might contribute to these phenomena is not clear. Using quantitative PCR and western blot analysis we show that levels of FPPS mRNA and protein can be upregulated in HeLa cells by culturing in lipoprotein deficient serum (LDS) or by over-expression of SREBP-1a. Upregulated, endogenous FPPS was predominantly localised to the cytosol and did not co-localise with peroxisomal or mitochondrial markers. Upregulation of endogenous FPPS conferred resistance to the inhibitory effect of low concentrations of ZOL on the prenylation of the small GTPase Rap1a. These observations suggest that an increase in the expression of endogenous FPPS could confer at least partial resistance to the pharmacological effect of N-BP drugs such as ZOL in vivo.

Differential regulation of the calpain–calpastatin complex by the L-domain of calpastatin,

Abstract: Here we demonstrate that the presence of the L-domain in calpastatins induces biphasic interaction with calpain. Competition experiments revealed that the L-domain is involved in positioning the first inhibitory unit in close and correct proximity to the calpain active site cleft, both in the closed and in the open conformation. At high concentrations of calpastatin, the multiple EF-hand structures in domains IV and VI of calpain can bind calpastatin, maintaining the active site accessible to substrate. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that two distinct calpain–calpastatin complexes may occur in which calpain can be either fully inhibited (I) or fully active (II). In complex II the accessible calpain active site can be occupied by an additional calpastatin molecule, now a cleavable substrate. The consequent proteolysis promotes the accumulation of calpastatin free inhibitory units which are able of improving the capacity of the cell to inhibit calpain. This process operates under conditions of prolonged [Ca2+] alteration, as seen for instance in Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FALS) in which calpastatin levels are increased. Our findings show that the L-domain of calpastatin plays a crucial role in determining the formation of complexes with calpain in which calpain can be either inhibited or still active. Moreover, the presence of multiple inhibitory domains in native full-length calpastatin molecules provides a reservoir of potential inhibitory units to be used to counteract aberrant calpain activity.

Abstract: Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms exhibit different conformational stabilities and lipid-binding properties that give rise to altered cholesterol metabolism among the isoforms. Using Trp-substituted mutations and site-directed fluorescence labeling, we made a comprehensive comparison of the conformational organization of the N- and C-terminal domains and lipid interactions between the apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms. Trp fluorescence measurements for selectively Trp-substituted variants of apoE isoforms demonstrated that apoE4 adopts less stable conformations in both the N- and C-terminal domains compared to apoE3. Consistent with this, the conformational reorganization of the N-terminal helix bundle occurs at lower guanidine hydrochloride concentration in apoE4 than in apoE3 as monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Trp residues to acrylodan attached at the N-terminal helix. Upon binding of apoE3 and apoE4 variants to egg phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles, similar changes in Trp fluorescence or FRET efficiency were observed for the isoforms, indicating that the opening of the N-terminal helix bundle occurs similarly in apoE3 and apoE4. Introduction of mutations into the C-terminal domain of the apoE isoforms to prevent self-association and maintain the monomeric state resulted in great increase in the rate of binding of the C-terminal helices to a lipid surface. Overall, our results demonstrate that the different conformational organizations of the N- and C-terminal domains have a minor effect on the steady-state lipid-binding behavior of apoE3 and apoE4: rather, self-association property is a critical determinant in the kinetics of lipid binding through the C-terminal helices of apoE isoforms.

Abstract: Acylcarnitines have been linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance. However the majority of these studies have focused on acylcarnitines in plasma. It is currently unclear to what extent plasma levels of acylcarnitines reflect tissue acylcarnitine metabolism. We investigated the correlation of plasma acylcarnitine levels with selected tissue acylcarnitines as measured with tandem mass spectrometry, in both fed and fasted BALB/cJ (BALB) and C57BL/6N (Bl6) mice. Fasting affected acylcarnitine levels in all tissues. These changes varied substantially between the different tissue compartments. No significant correlations were found between plasma acylcarnitine species and their tissue counterparts in both mouse strains, with the exception of plasma C4OH-carnitine in BALB mice. We suggest that this lack of correlation is due to differences in acylcarnitine turnover rates between plasma and tissue compartments and the fact that the plasma acylcarnitine profile is a composition of acylcarnitines derived from different compartments. Therefore, plasma acylcarnitine levels do not reflect tissue levels and should be interpreted with caution. A focus on tissue acylcarnitine levels is warranted in metabolic studies.

Abstract: Iron bioavailability is crucial for mitochondrial metabolism and biosynthesis. Dysregulation of cellular iron homeostasis affects multiple aspects of mitochondrial physiology and cellular processes. However, the intracellular iron trafficking pathway in Candida albicans remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the Mrs4–Ccc1–Smf3 pathway, and demonstrated its important role in maintaining cellular iron levels. Double deletion of vacuolar iron exporter SMF3 and mitochondrial iron transporter MRS4 further elevated cellular iron levels in comparison with the single MRS4 deletion. However, deletion of vacuolar iron importer CCC1 in the mrs4∆/∆ mutant restored cellular iron homeostasis to normal wild-type levels, and also normalized most of the defective phenotypes in response to various environmental stresses. Our results also suggested that both Mrs4 and Ccc1 contributed to the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The mrs4∆/∆ and mrs4∆/∆smf3∆/∆ mutants exhibited an obvious decrease in aconitase activities and mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas deletion of CCC1 in the mrs4∆/∆ mutant effectively rescued these defects. Furthermore, we also found that the Mrs4–Ccc1–Smf3 pathway was indispensable for cell-wall stability, antifungal drug tolerance, filamentous growth and virulence, supporting the novel viewpoint that mitochondria might be the promising target for better antifungal therapies. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous iron failed to rescue the defects on non-fermentable carbon sources or hyphae-inducing medium, indicating that the defects in mitochondrial respiration and filamentous development might result from the disturbance of cellular iron homeostasis rather than environmental iron deprivation. Taken together, our results propose the Mrs4–Ccc1–Smf3 pathway as a potentially attractive target for antifungal drug development.

Abstract: Omi/HtrA2 is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial serine protease with dual and opposite functions that depend entirely on its subcellular localization. During apoptosis, Omi/HtrA2 is released into the cytoplasm where it participates in cell death. While confined in the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria, Omi/HtrA2 has a pro-survival function that may involve the regulation of protein quality control (PQC) and mitochondrial homeostasis. Loss of Omi/HtrA2's protease activity causes the neuromuscular disorder of the mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mutant mice. These mice develop multiple defects including neurodegeneration with parkinsonian features. Loss of Omi/HtrA2 in non-neuronal tissues has also been shown to cause premature aging. The normal function of Omi/HtrA2 in the mitochondria and how its deregulation causes neurodegeneration or premature aging are unknown. Here we report that the mitochondrial Mulan E3 ubiquitin ligase is a specific substrate of Omi/HtrA2. During exposure to H2O2, Omi/HtrA2 degrades Mulan, and this regulation is lost in cells that carry the inactive protease. Furthermore, we show accumulation of Mulan protein in various tissues of mnd2 mice as well as in Omi/HtrA2(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This causes a significant decrease of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protein, and increased mitophagy. Our work describes a new stress-signaling pathway that is initiated in the mitochondria and involves the regulation of Mulan by Omi/HtrA2 protease. Deregulation of this pathway, as it occurs in mnd2 mutant mice, causes mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy, and could be responsible for the motor neuron disease and the premature aging phenotype observed in these animals.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage including steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. We have previously reported that creatine supplementation prevents hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation in rats fed a high-fat diet. In this study, we employed oleate-treated McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells to investigate the role of creatine in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Creatine, but not structural analogs, reduced cellular TG accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Incubating cells with the pan-lipase inhibitor diethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate (E600) did not diminish the effect of creatine, demonstrating that the TG reduction brought about by creatine does not depend on lipolysis. Radiolabeled tracer experiments indicate that creatine increases fatty acid oxidation and TG secretion. In line with increased fatty acid oxidation, mRNA analysis revealed that creatine-treated cells had increased expression of PPARα and several of its transcriptional targets. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that creatine reduces lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and TG secretion.

Curcumin induces apoptosis of multidrug-resistant human leukemia HL60 cells by complex pathways leading to ceramide accumulation,

Abstract: Most anti-cancer agents induce apoptosis, however, a development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells and defects in apoptosis contribute often to treatment failure. Here, the mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis was investigated in human leukemia HL60 cells and their HL60/VCR multidrug-resistant counterparts. In both cell lines curcumin induced a bi-phasic ceramide generation with a slow phase until 6h followed by a more rapid one. The level of the ceramide accumulation correlated inversely with the cell viability. We found that the ceramide elevation resulted from multifarious changes of the activity of sphingolipid-modifying enzymes. In both cell lines curcumin induced relatively fast activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), which peaked at 3h, and was followed by inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase activity. In addition, in HL60/VCR cells the glucosylceramide synthase activity was diminished by curcumin. This process was probably due to curcumin-induced down-regulation of P-gp drug transporter, since cyclosporine A, a P-gp blocker, also inhibited the glucosylceramide synthase activity. Inhibition of nSMase activity with GW4869 or silencing of SMPD3 gene encoding nSMase2 reversed the curcumin-induced inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase without affecting the glucosylceramide synthase activity. The early ceramide generation by nSMase was indispensable for the later lipid accumulation, modulation of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase 3 levels, and for reduction of cell viability in curcumin-treated cells, as all these events were inhibited by GW4869 or nSMase2 depletion. These data indicate that the early ceramide generation by nSMase2 induced by curcumin intensifies the later ceramide accumulation via inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase, and controls pro-apoptotic signaling.

Abstract: Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58), as an adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) activator, strongly increases ATGL-mediated triglyceride (TG) catabolism. Previous studies have shown that CGI-58 affects intestinal cholesterol homeostasis independently of ATGL activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that CGI-58 was involved in macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic lesion formation. Here, we generated macrophage-specific CGI-58 transgenic mice (Mac-CGI-58 Tg) using an SRA promoter, which was further mated with ApoE−/− mice to create litters of CGI-58 Tg/ApoE−/− mice. These CGI-58 Tg/ApoE−/− mice exhibited an anti-atherosclerosis phenotype compared with wild type (WT) controls (CGI-58 WT/ApoE−/−), illustrated by less plaque area in aortic roots. Moreover, macrophage-specific CGI-58 overexpression in mice resulted in up-regulated levels of plasma total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. Consequently, higher expression levels of PPARa, PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1, and ABCG1 were detected in macrophages from CGI-58 Tg/ApoE−/− mice compared to CGI-58 WT/ApoE−/− counterparts, which were accompanied by elevated macrophage cholesterol efflux toward HDL and Apo A1. Nevertheless, serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were reduced by macrophage-specific CGI-58 overexpression. Finally, bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments further revealed that ApoE−/− mice reconstituted with Mac-CGI-58 Tg BM cells (ApoE−/−/Tg-BM chimera) displayed a significant reduction of atherosclerosis lesions compared with control mice reconstituted with Mac-CGI-58 WT BM cells (ApoE−/−/WT-BM chimera). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that CGI-58 overexpression in macrophages may protect against atherosclerosis development in mice.

Abstract: The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are a group of stress-activated protein kinases that regulate gene expression changes through specific phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factor substrates. To address the mechanisms underlying JNK nuclear entry, we employed a semi-intact cell system to demonstrate for the first time that JNK1 nuclear entry is dependent on the importin α2/β1 heterodimer and independent of importins α3, α4, β2, β3, 7 and 13. However, quantitative image analysis of JNK1 localization following exposure of cells to either arsenite or hyperosmotic stress did not indicate its nuclear accumulation. Extending our analyses to define the dynamics of nuclear trafficking of JNK1, we combined live cell imaging analyses with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) protocols. Subnuclear and subcytoplasmic bleaching protocols revealed the slowed movement of JNK1 in both regions in response to hyperosmotic stress. Strikingly, while movement into the nucleus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or transport of a GFP-T-antigen fusion protein as estimated by initial rates and time to reach half-maximal recovery (t1/2) measures remained unaltered, hyperosmotic stress slowed the nuclear entry of GFP-JNK1. In contrast, arsenite exposure which did not alter the initial rates of nuclear accumulation of GFP, GFP-T-antigen or GFP-JNK1, decreased the t1/2 for nuclear accumulation of both GFP and GFP-JNK1. Thus, our results challenge the paradigm of increased nuclear localization of JNK broadly in response to all forms of stress-activation and are consistent with enhanced interactions of stress-activated JNK1 with scaffold and substrate proteins throughout the nucleus and the cytosol under conditions of hyperosmotic stress.

Abstract: Neuronal differentiation is a complex process characterized by a halt in proliferation and extension of neurites from the cell body. This process is accompanied by changes in gene expression that mediate the redirection leading to neurite formation and function. Acceleration of membrane phospholipids synthesis is associated with neurite elongation, and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is the major membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells. The transcription of two genes in particular encoding key enzymes in the CDP–choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis are stimulated; the Chka gene for choline kinase (CK) alpha isoform and the Pcyt1a gene for the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) alpha isoform. We report that the stimulation of CKα expression during retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation depends on a promoter region that contains two CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Protein-β (C/EBPβ) sites. We demonstrate that during neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells, RA induces Chka expression by a mechanism that involves ERK1/2 activation which triggers C/EBPβ expression. Elevated levels of C/EBPβ bind to the Chka proximal promoter (Box1) inducing CKα expression. In addition we identified a downstream sequence named Box2 which together with Box1 is required for the promoter to reach the full induction. This is the first elucidation of the mechanism by which the expression of Chka is coordinately regulated during neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Recently, it was revealed that tumor cells are significantly softer than normal cells. Although this phenomenon is well known, it is connected with many questions which are still unanswered. Among these questions are the molecular mechanisms which cause the change in stiffness and the correlation between cell mechanical properties and their metastatic potential. We studied mechanical properties of cells with different levels of cancer transformation. Transformed cells in three systems with different transformation types (monooncogenic N-RAS, viral and cells of tumor origin) were characterized according to their morphology, actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion organization. Transformation led to reduction of cell spreading and thus decreasing the cell area, disorganization of actin cytoskeleton, lack of actin stress fibers and decline in the number and size of focal adhesions. These alterations manifested in a varying degree depending on type of transformation. Force spectroscopy by atomic force microscopy with spherical probes was carried out to measure the Young's modulus of cells. In all cases the Young's moduli were fitted well by log-normal distribution. All the transformed cell lines were found to be 40–80% softer than the corresponding normal ones. For the cell system with a low level of transformation the difference in stiffness was less pronounced than for the two other systems. This suggests that cell mechanical properties change upon transformation, and acquisition of invasive capabilities is accompanied by significant softening.

Abstract: The store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) represent one of the major calcium-entry pathways in non-excitable cells. SOCs and in particular their major components ORAI1 and STIM1 have been shown to be implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes such as apoptosis, proliferation and invasion. Here we demonstrate that ORAI1 and STIM1 mediate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. We show that both ORAI1 and STIM1 play pro-survival anti-apoptotic role in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of ORAI1 and/or STIM1 increases apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. We also demonstrate that both 5-FU and gemcitabine treatments increase SOCE in Panc1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line via upregulation of ORAI1 and STIM1. Altogether our results reveal the novel calcium-dependent mechanism of action of the chemotherapy drugs 5-FU and gemcitabine and emphasize the anti-apoptotic role of ORAI1 and STIM1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.

Abstract: Angiotensin II (Ang II)-elicited excessive proliferation, hypertrophy and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are vital to the pathogenesis of atheroclerosis. Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) exists extensively in various kinds of cells and protects cells against different stresses. However, knowledge remains limited about what GSTpi acts in VSMCs. We investigated the effect of GSTpi on Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation, hypertrophy and migration and its latent mechanism. Overexpression and RNAi experiments demonstrated that GSTpi inhibited Ang II-induced proliferation, hypertrophy and migration of VSMCs and arrested progression of cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy analyses showed that GSTpi directly associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to prevent Ang II-triggered binding of Src to STAT3 and thus suppressed Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, as well as cyclin D1 expression. In contrast, GSTpi didn't affect Ang II-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). GSTpi acts as a negative regulator to prevent Ang II-triggered proliferative signaling in VSMCs, suggesting that it may protect vessels against the stresses associated with atherosclerosis formation.

Abstract: Although an in vitro 3D environment cannot completely mimic the in vivo tumor site, embedding tumor cells in a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) allows for the study of cancer cell behaviors and the screening of anti-metastatic reagents with a more in vivo-like context. Here we explored the behaviors of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells embedded in 3D collagen I. Diverse tumor environmental conditions (including cell density, extracellular acidity, or hypoxia as mimics for a continuous tumor growth) reduced JNKs, enhanced TGFβ1/Smad signaling activity, induced Snail1, and reduced cortactin expression. The reduced JNKs activity blocked efficient formation of invadopodia labeled with actin, cortactin, or MT1-MMP. JNKs inactivation activated Smad2 and Smad4, which were required for Snail1 expression. Snail1 then repressed cortactin expression, causing reduced invadopodia formation and prominent localization of MT1-MMP at perinuclear regions. MDA-MB-231 cells thus exhibited less efficient collagen I degradation and invasion in 3D collagen I upon JNKs inhibition. These observations support a signaling network among JNKs, Smads, Snail1, and cortactin to regulate the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells embedded in 3D collagen I, which may be targeted during screening of anti-invasion reagents.

Abstract: Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.4), which converts 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetaldehyde, belongs to the core metabolism of living organisms. It was previously shown that human cells harbor deoxyribose phosphate aldolase activity but the protein responsible of this activity has never been formally identified. This study provides the first experimental evidence that DERA, which is mainly expressed in lung, liver and colon, is the human deoxyribose phosphate aldolase. Among human cell lines, the highest DERA mRNA level and deoxyribose phosphate aldolase activity were observed in liver-derived Huh-7 cells. DERA was shown to interact with the known stress granule component YBX1 and to be recruited to stress granules after oxidative or mitochondrial stress. In addition, cells in which DERA expression was down-regulated using shRNA formed fewer stress granules and were more prone to apoptosis after clotrimazole stress, suggesting the importance of DERA for stress granule formation. Furthermore, the expression of DERA was shown to permit cells in which mitochondrial ATP production was abolished to make use of extracellular deoxyinosine to maintain ATP levels. This study unraveled a previously undescribed pathway which may allow cells with high deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase activity, such as liver cells, to minimize or delay stress-induced damage by producing energy through deoxynucleoside degradation.

Abstract: Mutants of tumor suppressor p53 not only lose the activity in genome stabilizing and in tumor suppression, but also exhibit oncogenic function in cancer cells. Most efforts in restoring p53 biological activity focus on either altering mutant-protein conformation or introducing an exogenous p53 gene into cells to eliminate p53-mutant cancer cells. Being different from these, we report that ceramide can restore the expression of wild-type p53 and induce p53-dependent apoptosis in deletion-mutant cancer cells. We show that endogenous long-carbon chain ceramide species (C16- to C24-ceramides) and exogenous C6-ceramide, rather than other sphingolipids, restore wild-type mRNA (intact exon-5), phosphorylated protein (Ser15 in exon-5) of p53, and p53-responsive proteins, including p21 and Bax, in ovarian cancer cells, which predominantly express a deleted exon-5 of p53 mutant before treatments. Consequently, the restored p53 sensitizes these p53-mutant cancer cells to DNA damage-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we elucidate that ceramide activates protein phosphatase-1, and then the dephosphorylated serine/arginine-rich splicing-factor 1 (SRSF1) is translocated to the nucleus, thus promoting pre-mRNA splicing preferentially to wild-type p53 expression. These findings disclose an unrecognized mechanism that pre-mRNA splicing dysfunction can result in p53 deletion-mutants. Ceramide through SRSF1 restores wild-type p53 expression versus deletion-mutant and leads cancer cells to apoptosis. This suggests that heterozygous deletion-mutants of p53 can be restored in posttranscriptional level by using epigenetic approaches.

Abstract: Akt (also known as PKB) is a survival kinase frequently up-regulated in cancer; three isoforms of Akt exist, and among them Akt1 and Akt2 are the most widely and highly expressed. They share the same structure and activation mechanism and have many overlapping functions; nevertheless isoform-specific roles and substrates have been reported, which are expected to rely on sequence diversities. In particular, a special role in differentiating Akt1 and Akt2 isoforms has been assigned to the linker region, a short segment between the PH and the catalytic domains. We have previously found that a residue in the linker region (Ser129) is directly phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 in Akt1; the phosphorylation of the homologous residue in Akt2 (Ser131) has never been analyzed. Here we show that Akt2, endogenously or ectopically expressed in different cell lines, is not phosphorylated on Ser131 by CK2, while in vitro recombinant Akt2 is a CK2 substrate. These data support the hypothesis that in vivo a steric hindrance occurs which prevents the access to the CK2 site. Additionally, we have found that Ser129 phosphorylation is involved in the recognition of the Akt1-specific substrate palladin; this observation provides an explanation of why Akt2, lacking Ser131 phosphorylation in the linker region, has a low efficiency in targeting palladin. CK2-dependent phosphorylation is therefore a crucial event which, discriminating between Akt1 and Akt2, can account for different substrate specificities, and, more in general, for fine tuning of Akt activity in the control of isoform-dependent processes.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cellular invasiveness are two pivotal processes for the development of metastatic tumor phenotypes. The metastatic profile of non-metastatic MCF-7 cells growing as multi-cellular tumor microspheroids (MCTSs) was analyzed by determining the contents of the EMT, invasive and migratory proteins, as well as their migration and invasiveness potential and capacity to secrete active cytokines such as the glucose phosphate isomerase/AMF (GPI/AMF). As for the control, the same analysis was also performed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (highly metastatic, MDA) monolayer cells, and in stage IIIB and IV human metastatic breast biopsies. The proliferative cell layers (PRL) of mature MCF-7 MCTSs, MDA monolayer cells and metastatic biopsies exhibited increased cellular contents (2–15 times) of EMT (β-catenin, SNAIL), migratory (vimentin, cytokeratin, and fibronectin) and invasive (MMP-1, VEGF) proteins versus MCF-7 monolayer cells, quiescent cell layers of mature MCF-7 MCTS and non-metastatic breast biopsies. The increase in metastatic proteins correlated with substantially elevated cellular abilities for migration (18-times) and invasiveness (13-times) and with the higher level (6-times) of the cytokine GPI/AMF in the extracellular medium of PRL, as compared to MCF-7 monolayer cells. Interestingly, the addition of the GPI/AMF inhibitors erythrose-4-phosphate or 6-phosphogluconate at micromolar doses significantly decreased its extracellular activity (>80%), with a concomitant diminution in the metastatic protein content and migratory tumor cell capacity, and with no inhibitory effect on tumor lactate production or toxicity on 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The present findings provide new insights into the discovery of metabolic inhibitors to be used as complementary therapy against metastatic and aggressive tumors.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a pro-fibrotic mediator acting via specific receptors (LPARs) and is synthesized by autotaxin, that increases with obesity. We tested whether LPA could play a role in adipose tissue (AT)-fibrosis associated with obesity. Fibrosis [type I, III, and IV collagens (COL), fibronectin (FN), TGFβ, CTGF and αSMA] and inflammation (MCP1 and F4/80) markers were quantified: (i) in vivo in inguinal (IAT) and perigonadic (PGAT) AT from obese-diabetic db/db mice treated with the LPAR antagonist Ki16425 (5mg/kg/day ip for 7weeks); and (ii) in vitro in human AT explants in primary culture for 72h in the presence of oleoyl-LPA (10μM) and/or Ki16425 (10μM) and/or the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1 (100μM). Treatment of db/db mice with Ki16425 reduced Col I and IV mRNAs in IAT and PGAT while Col III mRNAs were only reduced in IAT. This was associated with reduction of COL protein staining in both IAT and PGAT. AT explants showed a spontaneous and time-dependent increase in ATX expression and production of LPA in the culture medium, along with increased levels of Col I and III, TGFβ and αSMA mRNAs and of COL protein staining. In vitro fibrosis was blocked by Ki16425 and was further amplified by oleoyl-LPA. LPA-dependent in vitro fibrosis was blocked by co-treatment with YC1. Our results show that endogenous and exogenous LPA exert a pro-fibrotic activity in AT in vivo and in vitro. This activity could be mediated by an LPA1R-dependent pathway and could involve HIF-1α.

Abstract: Backgrounds
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been proposed to enhance β-cell functions. Clinical studies have suggested that apolipoprotein M (apoM), which rides mainly on HDL, is involved in diabetes; however, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Recently, apoM was shown to be a carrier for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of insulin secretion by apoM through the action of S1P.
Methods and results
We overexpressed apoM in the livers of C57BL6 mice using adenovirus gene transfer and found that the blood glucose levels under ad libitum feeding conditions were lower in the apoM-overexpressing mice. While an insulin tolerance test revealed that insulin sensitivity was not significantly affected, a glucose tolerance test revealed that apoM-overexpressing mice had a better glucose tolerance because of enhanced insulin secretion, a phenomenon that was reversed by treatment with VPC 23019, an antagonist against S1P1 and S1P3 receptor. In vitro experiments with MIN6 cells also revealed that apoM-containing lipoproteins enhanced insulin secretion, which was again inhibited by VPC 23019. ApoM retarded the degradation of S1P, and an increase in Pdx1 expression, the attenuation of endoreticulum stress, and the phosphorylation of Akt, AmpK, and Erk were observed as possible underlying mechanisms for the effect of S1P, maintained at a high concentration by apoM, on the increase in insulin secretion.
Conclusions
ApoM augmented insulin secretion by maintaining the S1P concentration under both in vivo and in vitro conditions.

Abstract: Fibrosis is a pathological situation in which excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) are deposited in the tissue. Myofibroblasts play a crucial role in the development and progress of fibrosis as they actively synthesize ECM components such as collagen I, fibronectin and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and cause organ fibrosis. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) plays a major role in tissue fibrosis. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a type I receptor of TGF-β1 with an important role in angiogenesis whose function in cellular biology and TGF-β signaling is well known in endothelial cells, but its role in fibroblast biology and its contribution to fibrosis is poorly studied. We have recently demonstrated that ALK1 regulates ECM protein expression in a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy. Our aim was to evaluate the role of ALK1 in several processes involved in fibrosis such as ECM protein expression, proliferation and migration in ALK1+/+ and ALK1+/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after TGF-β1 stimulations and inhibitors. ALK1 heterozygous MEFs show increased expression of ECM proteins (collagen I, fibronectin and CTGF/CCN2), cell proliferation and migration due to an alteration of TGF-β/Smad signaling. ALK1 heterozygous disruption shows an increase of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation that explains the increases in CTGF/CCN2, fibronectin and collagen I, proliferation and cell motility observed in these cells. Therefore, we suggest that ALK1 plays an important role in the regulation of ECM protein expression, proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Inflammasome, an intracellular inflammatory machinery, has been reported to be involved in a variety of chronic degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, autoinflammatory diseases and Alzheimer's disease. The present study hypothesized that the formation and activation of inflammasomes associated with apoptosis associated speck-like protein (ASC) are an important initiating mechanism resulting in obesity-associated podocyte injury and consequent glomerular sclerosis. To test this hypothesis, Asc gene knockout (Asc−/−), wild type (Asc+/+) and intrarenal Asc shRNA-transfected wild type (Asc shRNA) mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet (ND) for 12weeks to produce obesity and associated glomerular injury. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that renal tissue Asc expression was lacking in Asc−/− mice or substantially reduced in Asc shRNA transfected mice compared to Asc+/+ mice. Confocal microscopic and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the HFD enhanced the formation of inflammasome associated with Asc in podocytes as shown by colocalization of Asc with Nod-like receptor protein 3 (Nalp3). This inflammasome complex aggregation was not observed in Asc−/− and local Asc shRNA-transfected mice. The caspase-1 activity, IL-1β production and glomerular damage index (GDI) were also significantly attenuated in Asc−/− and Asc shRNA-transfected mice fed the HFD. This decreased GDI in Asc−/− and Asc shRNA transfected mice on the HFD was accompanied by attenuated proteinuria, albuminuria, foot process effacement of podocytes and loss of podocyte slit diaphragm molecules. In conclusion, activation and formation of inflammasomes in podocytes are importantly implicated in the development of obesity-associated glomerular injury.

Contrasting effects of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid membrane incorporation into cardiomyocytes on free cholesterol turnover,

Abstract: The preservation of a constant pool of free cholesterol (FC) is critical to ensure several functions of cardiomyocytes. We investigated the impact of the membrane incorporation of arachidonic acid (C20:4 ω6, AA) or docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 ω3, DHA) as ω6 or ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on cholesterol homeostasis in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We measured significant alterations to the phospholipid FA profiles, which had markedly different ω6/ω3 ratios between the AA and DHA cells (13 vs. 1). The AA cells showed a 2.7-fold lower cholesterol biosynthesis than the DHA cells. Overall, the AA cells showed 2-fold lower FC masses and 2-fold higher cholesteryl ester masses than the DHA cells. The AA cells had a lower FC to phospholipid ratio and higher triglyceride levels than the DHA cells. Moreover, the AA cells showed a 40% decrease in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated and a 19% decrease in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux than the DHA cells. The differences in cholesterol efflux pathways induced by AA or DHA incorporation were not caused by variations in ABCs transporter expression and were reduced when ABC transporters were overexpressed by exposure to LXR/RXR agonists. These results show that AA incorporation into cardiomyocyte membranes decreased the FC turnover by markedly decreasing the endogenous cholesterol synthesis and by decreasing the ABCA1- and ABCG1-cholesterol efflux pathways, whereas DHA had the opposite effects. We propose that these observations may partially contribute to the beneficial effects on the heart of a diet containing a high ω3/ω6 PUFA ratio.

Abstract: Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) is an intracellular lipid binding protein whose specific functions within the cell are still uncertain. An abbreviated version of IFABP encompassing residues 29–126, dubbed Δ98Δ is a stable product of limited proteolysis with clostripain of holo-IFABP. Cumulative evidence shows that Δ98Δ adopts a stable, monomeric and functional fold, with compact core and loose periphery. In agreement with previous results, this abridged variant indicates that the helical domain is not necessary to preserve the general topology of IFABP's β-barrel and that the helix-turn-helix motif is a fundamental element of the portal region involved in ligand binding and protein–membrane interactions. Results presented here suggest that Δ98Δ binds fatty acids with affinities lower than IFABP but higher than those shown by previous helix-less variants, shows a ‘diffusional’ fatty acid transfer mechanism and it interacts with artificial membranes. This work highlights the importance of the β-barrel of IFABP for its specific functions.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is an intracellularly generated bioactive lipid essential for development, vascular integrity, and immunity. These functions are mediated by S1P-selective cell surface G-protein coupled receptors. S1P signaling therefore requires extracellular release of this lipid. Several cell types release S1P and evidence for both plasma membrane transporter-mediated and vesicle-dependent secretion has been presented. Platelets are an important source of S1P and can release it in response to agonists generated at sites of vascular injury. S1P release from agonist-stimulated platelets was measured in the presence of a carrier molecule (albumin) using HPLC-MS/MS. The kinetics and agonist-dependence of S1P release were similar to that of other granule cargo e.g. platelet factor IV (PF4). Agonist-stimulated S1P release was defective in platelets from Unc13dJinx (Munc13-4 null) mice demonstrating a critical role for regulated membrane fusion in this process. Consistent with this observation, platelets efficiently converted fluorescent NBD-sphingosine to its phosphorylated derivative which accumulated in granules. Fractionation of platelet organelles revealed the presence of S1P in both the plasma membrane and in α-granules. Resting platelets contained a second pool of constitutively releasable S1P that was more rapidly labeled by exogenously added sphingosine. Our studies indicate that platelets contain two pools of S1P that are released extracellularly: a readily-exchangeable, metabolically active pool of S1P, perhaps in the plasma membrane, and a granular pool that requires platelet activation and regulated exocytosis for release.

Abstract: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid present in fish oil, may exert cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects on colon cancer cells when applied individually or in combination with some anticancer drugs. Here we demonstrate a selective ability of subtoxic doses of DHA to enhance antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of clinically useful cytokine TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand) in cancer but not normal human colon cells. DHA-mediated stimulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis was associated with extensive engagement of mitochondrial pathway (Bax/Bak activation, drop of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release), activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response (CHOP upregulation, changes in PERK level), decrease of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP, cIAP1) levels and significant changes in sphingolipid metabolism (intracellular levels of ceramides, hexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelines, sphingosines; HPLC/MS/MS). Interestingly, we found significant differences in representation of various classes of ceramides (especially C16:0, C24:1) between the cancer and normal colon cells treated with DHA and TRAIL, and suggested their potential role in the regulation of the cell response to the drug combination. These study outcomes highlight the potential of DHA for a new combination therapy with TRAIL for selective elimination of colon cancer cells via simultaneous targeting of multiple steps in apoptotic pathways.

Abstract: Lin28 is a small RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in regulating developmental timing, stem cell reprogramming, and oncogenesis. However, the significance of the effect of post-translational modifications on Lin28 activity is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that PCAF directly interacted with and acetylated Lin28. We also showed that the acetylation of Lin28 can be specifically reversed by the deacetylase SIRT1. These findings suggest that the PCAF/SIRT1 balance plays an important role in regulating Lin28 activity. Furthermore, we found that the cold shock domain of Lin28 is the major target of PCAF-mediated acetylation, which leads to a severe reduction in the Lin28 protein levels and an increase in the level of mature let-7a. This study provides the first demonstration that post-translational modification regulates Lin28 activity during let-7a biogenesis and sheds light on the regulation of Lin28 in ES cells and carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Transformed and tumoral cells share the characteristic of being able to proliferate even when external calcium concentration is very low. We have investigated whether Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, human hepatoma cell Huh-7 and HeLa cells were able to proliferate when kept 72h in complete culture medium without external calcium. Our data showed that cell proliferation rate was similar over a range of external calcium concentration (2μM to 1.8mM). Incubation in the absence of external calcium for 72h had no significant effect on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ contents but resulted in a significant decrease in cytosolic free calcium concentration in all 3 cell types. Cell proliferation rates were dependent on Orai1 and Orai3 expression levels in HEK293 and HeLa cells. Silencing Orai1 or Orai3 resulted in a 50% reduction in cell proliferation rate. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Orai3 induced a small but significant increase in cell number in G2/M phase. RO-3306, a cdk-1 inhibitor, induced a 90% arrest in G2/M reversible in less than 15min. Our data showed that progression through G2/M phase after release from RO-3306-induced cell cycle arrest was slower in both Orai1 and Orai3 knock-downs. Overexpressing Orai1, Orai3 and the dominant negative non-permeant mutants E106Q-Orai1 and E81Q-Orai3 induced a 50% increase in cell proliferation rate in HEK293 cells. Our data clearly demonstrated that Orai1 and Orai3 proteins are more important than calcium influx to control cell proliferation in some cell lines and that this process is probably independent of ICRAC and Iarc.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) accompanies obesity and insulin resistance. Recent meta-analysis suggested omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA to decrease liver fat in NAFLD patients. Anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and insulin-sensitizing effects of DHA/EPA depend on their lipid form, with marine phospholipids showing better efficacy than fish oils. We characterized the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of DHA/EPA phospholipids, alone or combined with an antidiabetic drug, on hepatosteatosis. C57BL/6N mice were fed for 7weeks an obesogenic high-fat diet (cHF) or cHF-based interventions: (i) cHF supplemented with phosphatidylcholine-rich concentrate from herring (replacing 10% of dietary lipids; PC), (ii) cHF containing rosiglitazone (10mg/kg diet; R), or (iii) PC+R. Metabolic analyses, hepatic gene expression and lipidome profiling were performed. Results showed that PC and PC+R prevented cHF-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance, while all interventions reduced abdominal fat and plasma triacylglycerols. PC and PC+R also lowered hepatic and plasma cholesterol and reduced hepatosteatosis. Microarray analysis revealed integrated down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways by PC, while R-induced lipogenesis was fully counteracted in PC+R. Gene expression changes in PC and PC+R were associated with preferential enrichment of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions by DHA/EPA. The complex down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes and the antisteatotic effects were unique to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids, since they were absent in mice fed soy-derived phosphatidylcholine. Thus, inhibition of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis associated with potent antisteatotic effects in the liver in response to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids support their use in NAFLD prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Interleukin-6 is one of the most prominent triggers of inflammatory processes. We have shown recently that heteroarylketones (HAKs) interfere with stimulated interleukin-6 expression in astrocytes by suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation at serine 727. Surprisingly, this effect is not based on the inhibition of STAT3-relevant kinases. Therefore, we here used the structurally modified HAK compound biotin-HAK-3 in a reverse chemical approach to identify the relevant molecular target in UV-mediated cross-linking experiments. Employing streptavidin-specific 2D-immunoblotting followed by mass spectrometry we identified nine proteins putatively interacting with biotin-HAK-3. After co-immunoprecipitation, co-immunofluorescence, surface plasmon resonance analyses and RNAi-mediated knock-down, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) was verified as the relevant target of HAK bioactivity. eEF1A1 forms complexes with STAT3 and PKCδ, which are crucial for STAT3S727 phosphorylation and for NF-κB/STAT3-enhanced interleukin-6 expression. Furthermore, the intracellular HAK accumulation is strongly dependent on eEF1A1 expression. Taken together, the results reveal a novel molecular mechanism for a non-canonical role of eEF1A1 in signal transduction via direct modulation of kinase-dependent phosphorylation events.

Abstract: RecQ family DNA helicases function in the maintenance of genome stability. Mice deficient in RecQL5, one of five RecQ helicases, show a cancer predisposition phenotype, suggesting that RecQL5 plays a tumor suppressor role. RecQL5 interacts with Rad51, a key factor in homologous recombination (HR), and displaces Rad51 from Rad51-single stranded DNA (ssDNA) filaments in vitro. However, the precise roles of RecQL5 in the cell remain elusive. Here, we present evidence suggesting that RecQL5 is involved in DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. Chicken DT40 RECQL5 gene knockout (KO) cells showed sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents such as cisplatin (CDDP) and mitomycin C (MMC) and a higher number of chromosome aberrations in the presence of MMC than wild-type cells. The phenotypes of RECQL5 KO cells resembled those of Fanconi anemia gene KO cells. Genetic analysis using corresponding gene knockout cells showed that RecQL5 is involved in the FANCD1 (BRCA2)-dependent ICL repair pathway in which Rad51-ssDNA filament formation is promoted by BRCA2. The disappearance but not appearance of Rad51-foci was delayed in RECQL5 KO cells after MMC treatment. Deletion of Rad54, which processes the Rad51-ssDNA filament in HR, in RECQL5 KO cells increased sensitivity to CDDP and further delayed the disappearance of Rad51-foci, suggesting that RecQL5 and Rad54 have different effects on the Rad51-ssDNA filament. Furthermore, the frequency and variation of CDDP-induced gene conversion at the immunoglobulin locus were increased in RECQL5 KO cells. These results suggest that RecQL5 plays a role in regulating the incidence and quality of ICL-induced recombination.

Abstract: The coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi is a bloom-forming marine phytoplankton thought to play a key role as a biological pump that transfers carbon from the surface to the bottom of the ocean, thus contributing to the global carbon cycle. This alga is also known to accumulate a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids. At 25°C, E. huxleyi produces mainly 14:0, 18:4n−3, 18:5n−3 and 22:6n−3. When the cells were transferred from 25°C to 15°C, the amount of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. 18:1n−9, 18:3n−3 and 18:5n−3, gradually increased. Among the predicted desaturase genes whose expression levels were up-regulated at low temperature, we identified a gene encoding novel ∆15 fatty acid desaturase, EhDES15, involved in the production of n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in E. huxleyi. This desaturase contains a putative transit sequence for localization in chloroplasts and a ∆6 desaturase-like domain, but it does not contain a cytochrome b5 domain nor typical His-boxes found in ∆15 desaturases. Heterologous expression of EhDES15 cDNA in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells increased the level of n−3 fatty acid species, which are produced at low levels in wild-type cells grown at 30°C. The orthologous genes are only conserved in the genomes of prasinophytes and cryptophytes. The His-boxes conserved in orthologues varied from that of the canonical ∆15 desaturases. These results suggested the gene encodes a novel ∆15 desaturase responsible for the synthesis of 18:3n−3 from 18:2n−6 in E. huxleyi.

Abstract: Many eukaryotic proteins exert their physiological function in specific cellular compartments. Proteins of the inter-membrane space (IMS) of mitochondria, for example, are synthesized in the cytoplasm and translocate to the IMS, where they are further processed to their mature form. In-cell Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has proven to be an ideal approach to investigate eukaryotic proteins at the atomic level, inside the cytoplasm. Here we show that proteins inside intact mitochondria isolated from human cells can be structurally characterized by NMR (in-mitochondria NMR). By this approach, we characterized the folding and maturation state of two human proteins in the IMS, SOD1 and Mia40. Both observed proteins were in the folded state. Mia40 was in the oxidized, functional state, while SOD1 disulfide bond formation was promoted by increasing the level of the SOD1 chaperone, CCS, in the IMS.

Abstract: We previously identified cytosolic lipid–protein particles (CLPP) having size and density of HDL in rat astrocytes, to which apoA-I induces translocation of cholesterol, caveolin-1 and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) following its association with microtubules prior to cholesterol release/biogenesis of HDL (JBC 277: 7929, 2002; JLR 45: 2269, 2004). To further understand the physiological relevance of these findings, we investigated the CLPP/microtubule association and its role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking by using a technique of reconstituted microtubule-like filaments (rMT) in rat astrocyte cytosol. When the cells were pretreated with apoA-I, α-tubulin as a 52-kDa protein in rMT was found phosphorylated while α-tubulin in a soluble monomeric form was little phosphorylated. The phosphorylation took place coincidentally to apoA-I-induced association with rMT of CLPP, a complex containing PKCα, and was suppressed by a PKC inhibitor, Bis indolylmaleimide 1 (BIM). α-Tubulin dissociated from CLPP when phosphorylated, and it poorly bound to CLPP once dissociated. BIM did not influence association of PKCα with rMT but suppressed apoA-I-induced cholesterol translocation to the cytosol from the ER/Golgi apparatus and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release. We thereby concluded that α-tubulin phosphorylation by PKCα on CLPP is involved in reversible CLPP association with the microtubules and intracellular cholesterol trafficking for apoA-I-dependent HDL biogenesis/cholesterol release in rat astrocytes.

Abstract: Methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) is a model for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in rodents. However, the mechanism of NASH development by dietary methionine/choline deficiency remains undetermined. To elucidate the early metabolic changes associated with MCD-NASH, serum metabolomic analysis was performed using mice treated with MCD and control diet for 3 days and 1 week, revealing significant increases in oleic and linoleic acids after MCD treatment. These increases were correlated with reduced body weight and white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and up-regulation of genes encoding carboxylesterase 3 and β2-adrenergic receptor in WAT, indicating accelerated lipolysis in adipocytes. The changes in serum fatty acids and WAT by MCD treatment were reversed by methionine supplementation, and similar alterations were detected in mice fed a methionine-deficient diet (MD), thus demonstrating that dietary methionine deficiency enhances lipolysis in WAT. MD treatment decreased glucose and increased fibroblast growth factor 21 in serum, thus exhibiting a similar metabolic phenotype as the fasting response. Comparison between MCD and choline-deficient diet (CD) treatments suggested that the addition of MD-induced metabolic alterations, such as WAT lipolysis, to CD-induced hepatic steatosis promotes liver injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate an important role for dietary methionine deficiency and WAT lipolysis in the development of MCD-NASH.

The sterol-based transcriptional control of human 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7): Evidence of a cooperative regulatory program in cholesterol synthesis,

Abstract: The enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) catalyzes the final step of cholesterol synthesis via the Kandutsch–Russell pathway, and is crucial in maintaining cellular cholesterol levels. Its absence leads to the devastating fetal developmental disorder Smith–Lemli–Opitz Syndrome (SLOS). How this enzyme is regulated has implications in controlling not only cholesterol synthesis, but also the synthesis of Vitamin D — another product of 7-dehydrocholesterol. In this study, we look specifically at how DHCR7 is regulated by the sterol regulatory element–binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) transcription factor. Sterol regulation has previously been studied in the rat DHCR7 promoter, but we have found that its regulatory elements are not all conserved in humans. Rather, the human promoter contains two binding sites for SREBP-2 (at −155 and −55) and a binding site for the nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) cofactor (at −136). The −155 site is a particularly responsive sterol regulatory element (SRE) which is well conserved in mammals, and was possibly overlooked in the rat promoter study. The exact location of the weaker −55 site (close to the known rat SRE) may have shifted during evolution. Furthermore, we established that the two SREs that bind SREBP-2 work in cooperation to synergistically activate DHCR7. We have previously characterized the SREs in DHCR24, the final enzyme in the alternate Bloch pathway of cholesterol synthesis. Here, comparison of the sterol regulation of these terminal enzymes demonstrates the unique cooperative system that helps to control cholesterol synthesis.

Abstract: High-level expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C is associated with chemoresistance and adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our previous study has found that VEGF-C induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in AML cell lines and significant correlation of VEGF-C and COX-2 in bone marrow specimens. COX-2 has been reported to mediate the proliferation and drug resistance in several solid tumors. Herein, we demonstrated that the VEGF-C-induced proliferation of AML cells is effectively abolished by the depletion or inhibition of COX-2. The expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) rapidly increased following treatment with VEGF-C. We found that ET-1 was also involved in the VEGF-C-mediated proliferation of AML cells, and that recombinant ET-1 induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expressions in AML cells. Treatment with the endothelin receptor A (ETRA) antagonist, BQ 123, or ET-1 shRNAs inhibited VEGF-C-induced COX-2 expression. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-C induces S phase accumulation through the inhibition of p27 and the upregulation of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase-2 expressions. The cell-cycle-related effects of VEGF-C were reversed by the depletion of COX-2 or ET-1. The depletion of COX-2 or ET-1 also suppressed VEGF-C-induced increases in the bcl-2/bax ratio and chemoresistance against etoposide and cytosine arabinoside in AML cells. We also demonstrated VEGF-C/ET-1/COX-2 axis-mediated chemoresistance in an AML xenograft mouse model. Our findings suggest that VEGF-C induces COX-2-mediated resistance to chemotherapy through the induction of ET-1 expression. Acting as a key regulator in the VEGF-C/COX-2 axis, ET-1 represents a potential target for ameliorating resistance to chemotherapy in AML patients.

Abstract: 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) is the key player of pro-inflammatory leukotriene biosynthesis. Its regulatory or so-called PLAT (polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, α-toxin) domain binds allosteric modulators like calcium, membranes, coactosin-like protein and Dicer, thereby influencing 5-LOX activity at the nuclear membrane by mediating translocation. The PLAT domain may also regulate cytosolic 5-LOX activity and possibly influence microRNA metabolism. Hence, it has also evolved as a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapy. Research focusing on this substructure of 5-LOX requires an assay system based on the isolated domain. However, we found that the isolated PLAT domain was highly prone to aggregation and therefore unsuitable for interaction studies. Substitution of the single, membrane-binding tryptophan 75 with glycine reduced aggregation and substantially increased its thermal stability. Calcium interaction of the single mutant was confirmed by differential scanning fluorimetry. Moreover, crosslinking experiments demonstrated the ability of the isolated PLAT domain to bind Dicer C-terminus whereas the interaction with coactosin-like protein required the interplay of the catalytic and the PLAT domain.

Abstract: The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a popular yeast expression system for the production of heterologous proteins in biotechnology. Interestingly, cell organelles which play an important role in this process have so far been insufficiently investigated. For this reason, we started a systematic approach to isolate and characterize organelles from P. pastoris. In this study, we present a procedure to isolate microsomal membranes at high purity. These samples represent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions which were subjected to molecular analysis of lipids and proteins. Organelle lipidomics included a detailed analysis of glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, sterols and sphingolipids. The microsomal proteome analyzed by mass spectrometry identified typical proteins of the ER known from other cell types, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also a number of unassigned gene products. The lipidome and proteome analysis of P. pastoris microsomes are prerequisite for a better understanding of functions of this organelle and for modifying this compartment for biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Aims/hypotheses
To examine hepatic expression of cholesterol-trafficking proteins, mitochondrial StarD1 and endosomal StarD3, and their relationship with dyslipidaemia and steatosis in Zucker (fa/fa) genetically obese rats, and to explore their functional role in lipid metabolism in rat McArdle RH-7777 hepatoma cells.
Methods
Expression of StarD1 and StarD3 in rat liver and hepatoma samples were determined by Q-PCR and/or immunoblotting; lipid mass by colorimetric assays; radiolabelled precursors were utilised to measure lipid synthesis and secretion, and lipidation of exogenous apolipoprotein A-I.
Results
Hepatic expression of StarD3 protein was repressed by genetic obesity in (fa/fa) Zucker rats, compared with lean (Fa/?) controls, suggesting a link with storage or export of lipids from the liver. Overexpression of StarD1 and StarD3, and knockdown of StarD3, in rat hepatoma cells, revealed differential effects on lipid metabolism. Overexpression of StarD1 increased utilisation of exogenous (preformed) fatty acids for triacylglycerol synthesis and secretion, but impacted minimally on cholesterol homeostasis. By contrast, overexpression of StarD3 increased lipidation of exogenous apoA-I, and facilitated de novo biosynthetic pathways for neutral lipids, potentiating triacylglycerol accumulation but possibly offering protection against lipotoxicity. Finally, StarD3 overexpression altered expression of genes which impact variously on hepatic insulin resistance, inducing Ppargcla, Cyp2e1, Nr1h4, G6pc and Irs1, and repressing expression of Scl2a1, Igfbp1, Casp3 and Serpine 1.
Conclusions/interpretation
Targeting StarD3 may increase circulating levels of HDL and protect the liver against lipotoxicity; loss of hepatic expression of this protein, induced by genetic obesity, may contribute to the pathogenesis of dyslipidaemia and steatosis.

Abstract: Systemic knockout of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the pivotal enzyme of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a murine phenotype that is characterized by progredient cardiac steatosis and severe heart failure. Since cardiac and vascular dysfunction have been closely related in numerous studies we investigated endothelium-dependent and -independent vessel function of ATGL knockout mice. Aortic relaxation studies and Langendorff perfusion experiments of isolated hearts showed that ATGL knockout mice suffer from pronounced micro- and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction. Experiments with agonists directly targeting vascular smooth muscle cells revealed the functional integrity of the smooth muscle cell layer. Loss of vascular reactivity was restored ~50% upon treatment of ATGL knockout mice with the PPARα agonist Wy14,643, indicating that this phenomenon is partly a consequence of impaired cardiac contractility. Biochemical analysis revealed that aortic endothelial NO synthase expression and activity were significantly reduced in ATGL deficiency. Enzyme activity was fully restored in ATGL mice treated with the PPARα agonist. Biochemical analysis of perivascular adipose tissue demonstrated that ATGL knockout mice suffer from perivascular inflammatory oxidative stress which occurs independent of cardiac dysfunction and might contribute to vascular defects. Our results reveal a hitherto unrecognized link between disturbed lipid metabolism, obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2) is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TG). DGAT2 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and also localizes to lipid droplets when cells are stimulated with oleate. Previous studies have shown that DGAT2 can interact with membranes and lipid droplets independently of its two transmembrane domains, suggesting the presence of an additional membrane binding domain. In order to identify additional membrane binding regions, we confirmed that DGAT2 has only two transmembrane domains and demonstrated that the loop connecting them is present in the ER lumen. Increasing the length of this short loop from 5 to 27 amino acids impaired the ability of DGAT2 to localize to lipid droplets. Using a mutagenesis approach, we were able to identify a stretch of amino acids that appears to have a role in binding DGAT2 to the ER membrane. Our results confirm that murine DGAT2 has only two transmembrane domains but also can interact with membranes via a previously unidentified helical domain containing its active site.

Abstract: Disrupting protein glycosylation induces ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress, resulting in the activation of UPR (unfolded protein response) pathways. A key function of the UPR is to restore ER homeostasis, but prolonged or unsolved ER stress can lead to apoptosis. MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1, also named ALL-1 or HRX), a histone H3K4 methyltransferase in mammals, plays important roles in leukemogenesis, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle and development. Here, we find that Mll1 deficiency enhances UPR and apoptosis induced by the glycosylation inhibitor TM (tunicamycin). The abnormal regulation of the UPR appears to be caused by a defect in protein glycosylation. Furthermore, Mll1 directly binds to the promoters of H6pd, Galnt12 and Ugp2, which regulates H3K4 trimethylation and the subsequent expression of these genes. The knockdown of H6pd, Galnt12 or Ugp2 enhances TM-induced apoptosis in Mll1+/+MEF cells, whereas the ectopic expression of these proteins inhibits TM-induced apoptosis in Mll1−/− MEF cells. Together, our data suggest that the maturation of glycoproteins in the ER is subject to regulation at the epigenetic level by a histone methyltransferase whose abnormality can lead to cancer and developmental defects.

Abstract: In the present study, we report that somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) plays a crucial role in modulation of β1AR and β2AR mediated signaling pathways that are associated with increased intracellular Ca2+ and cardiac complications. In H9c2 cells, SSTR2 colocalizes with β1AR or β2AR in receptor specific manner. SSTR2 selective agonist inhibits isoproterenol and formoterol stimulated cAMP formation and PKA phosphorylation in concentration dependent manner. In the presence of SSTR2 agonist, the expression of PKCα and PKCβ was comparable to the basal condition, however SSTR2 agonist inhibits isoproterenol or formoterol induced PKCα and PKCβ expression, respectively. Furthermore, the activation of SSTR2 not only inhibits calcineurin expression and its activity, but also blocks NFAT dephosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. SSTR2 selective agonist abrogates isoproterenol mediated increase in cell size and protein content (an index of hypertrophy). Taken together, the results described here provide direct evidence in support of cardiac protective role of SSTR2 via modulation of Ca2+ associated signaling pathways attributed to cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Neuregulin (NRG) stimulation of ErbB4 signaling is important for type II cell surfactant synthesis. ErbB4 may mediate gene expression via a non-canonical pathway involving enzymatic cleavage releasing its intracellular domain (4ICD) for nuclear trafficking and gene regulation. The accepted model for release of 4ICD is consecutive cleavage by Tumor necrosis factor alpha Converting Enzyme (TACE) and γ-secretase enzymes. Here, we show that 4ICD mediates surfactant synthesis and its release by γ-secretase is not dependent on previous TACE cleavage. We used siRNA to silence Presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) expression in a mouse lung type II epithelial cell line (MLE12 cells), and both siRNA knockdown and chemical inhibition of TACE. Knockdown of PSEN-1 significantly decreased baseline and NRG-stimulated surfactant phospholipid synthesis, expression of the surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, as well as 4ICD levels, with no change in ErbB4 ectodomain shedding. Neither siRNA knockdown nor chemical inhibition of TACE inhibited 4ICD release or surfactant synthesis. PSEN-1 cleavage of ErbB4 for non-canonical signaling through 4ICD release does not require prior cleavage by TACE.

Abstract: 5-Lipoxygenase (ALOX5) plays a key role in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes whereas 15-lipoxygenases (ALOX15) have been implicated in the formation of pro-resolving eicosanoids (lipoxins, resolvins). Recently, it has been suggested that a phosphorylation mimicking mutant (Ser663Asp) of a stabilized variant of human ALOX5 exhibits dominant arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase activity (>95%). To test whether similar alterations in the reaction specificity can also be observed for ALOX5 orthologs of other species we expressed wildtype and phosphorylation mimicking mutants (Ser271Asp, Ser523Asp, Ser663Asp, Ser663Glu) of human, mouse and zebrafish ALOX5 in pro- and eukaryotic overexpression systems and characterized their reaction specificities. We found that neither of the phosphorylation mimicking mutants produced significant amounts of 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and the 5-lipoxygenation/15-lipoxygenation ratio for all wildtype and mutant enzyme species was lower than 100:2. Taken together, this data suggest that phosphorylation of native ALOX5 orthologs of different vertebrates may not induce major alterations in the reaction specificity and thus may not inverse their biological activity.

Abstract: High expression of Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) has been found to confer cancer cell radio- and chemoresistance, however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, by using Aurora-A cDNA/shRNA or the specific inhibitor VX680, we show that Aurora-A upregulates cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth to enhance cell resistance to cisplatin and X-ray irradiation through dysregulation of DNA damage repair networks. Mechanistic studies showed that Aurora-A promoted the expression of ATM/Chk2, but suppressed the expression of BRCA1/2, ATR/Chk1, p53, pp53 (Ser15), H2AX, γH2AX (Ser319), and RAD51. Aurora-A inhibited the focus formation of γH2AX in response to ionizing irradiation. Treatment of cells overexpressing Aurora-A and ATM/Chk2 with the ATM specific inhibitor KU-55933 increased the cell sensitivity to cisplatin and irradiation through increasing the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and inhibiting the expression of Chk2, γH2AX (Ser319), and RAD51. Further study revealed that BRCA1/2 counteracted the function of Aurora-A to suppress the expression of ATM/Chk2, but to activate the expression of ATR/Chk1, pp53, γH2AX, and RAD51, leading to the enhanced cell sensitivity to irradiation and cisplatin, which was also supported by the results from animal assays. Thus, our data provide strong evidences that Aurora-A and BRCA1/2 inversely control the sensitivity of cancer cells to radio- and chemotherapy through the ATM/Chk2-mediated DNA repair networks, indicating that the DNA repair molecules including ATM/Chk2 may be considered for the targeted therapy against cancers with overexpression of Aurora-A.

Abstract: Proteins of all living organisms must reach their subcellular destination to sustain the cell structure and function. The proteins are transported to one of the cellular compartments, inserted into the membrane, or secreted across the membrane to the extracellular milieu. Cells have developed various mechanisms to transport proteins across membranes, among them localized translation. Evidence for targeting of Messenger RNA for the sake of translation of their respective protein products at specific subcellular sites in many eukaryotic model organisms have been accumulating in recent years. Cis-acting RNA localizing elements, termed RNA zip-codes, which are embedded within the mRNA sequence, are recognized by RNA-binding proteins, which in turn interact with motor proteins, thus coordinating the intracellular transport of the mRNA transcripts. Despite the rareness of conventional organelles, first and foremost a nucleus, pieces of evidence for mRNA localization to specific subcellular domains, where their protein products function, have also been obtained for prokaryotes. Although the underlying mechanisms for transcript localization in bacteria are yet to be unraveled, it is now obvious that intracellular localization of mRNA is a common mechanism to spatially localize proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Abstract: The PAS kinase Rim15 is proposed to integrate signals from different nutrient-sensing pathways and to control transcriptional reprogramming of Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon nutrient depletion. Despite this proposed role, previous transcriptome analyses of rim15 mutants solely focused on growing cultures. In the present work, retentostat cultivation enabled analysis of the role of Rim15 under severely calorie-restricted, virtually non-growing conditions. Under these conditions, deletion of RIM15 affected transcription of over 10-fold more genes than in growing cultures. Transcriptional responses, metabolic rates and cellular morphology indicated a key role of Rim15 in controlled cell-cycle arrest upon nutrient depletion. Moreover, deletion of rim15 reduced heat-shock tolerance in non-growing, but not in growing cultures. The failure of rim15 cells to adapt to calorie restriction by entering a robust post-mitotic state resembles cancer cell physiology and shows that retentostat cultivation of yeast strains can provide relevant models for healthy post-mitotic and transformed human cells.

Abstract: Alterations in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics during cancer cachexia were previously suggested; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. So, the goal of this study was to evaluate mitochondrial phospholipid remodeling in cancer-related muscle wasting and its repercussions to respiratory chain activity and fiber susceptibility to apoptosis. An animal model of urothelial carcinoma induced by exposition to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) and characterized by significant body weight loss due to skeletal muscle mass decrease was used. Morphological evidences of muscle atrophy were associated to decreased respiratory chain activity and increased expression of mitochondrial UCP3, which altogether highlight the lower ability of wasted muscle to produce ATP. Lipidomic analysis of isolated mitochondria revealed a significant decrease of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in BBN mitochondria, counteracted by increased phosphatidylcholine levels. Besides the impact on membrane fluidity, this phospholipid remodeling seems to justify, at least in part, the lower oxidative phosphorylation activity observed in mitochondria from wasted muscle and their increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Curiously, no evidences of lipid peroxidation were observed but proteins from BBN mitochondria, particularly the metabolic ones, seem more prone to carbonylation with the consequent implications in mitochondria functionality. Overall, data suggest that bladder cancer negatively impacts skeletal muscle activity specifically by affecting mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics and its interaction with proteins, ultimately leading to the dysfunction of this organelle. The regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways might be seen as potential therapeutic targets for the management of cancer-related muscle wasting.

Abstract: We characterized certain physiological functions of cyanobacterial monoglucosyldiacylglycerol using a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant in which the gene for monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase had been disrupted and its function complemented by inclusion of an Arabidopsis monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene. By using this method, we prepared the first viable monoglucosyldiacylglycerol-deficient mutant of cyanobacterium and found that monoglucosyldiacylglycerol is not essential for its growth and photosynthesis under a set of “normal growth conditions” when monogalactosyldiacylglycerol is adequately supplied by the Arabidopsis monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase. The mutant had healthy thylakoid membranes and normal pigment content. The membrane lipid composition of the mutant was similar with that of WT except lack of monoglucosyldiacylglycerol and a slight increase in the level of phosphatidylglycerol at both normal and low temperatures. However, the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol was reduced in the mutant compared with WT. Although the growth of the mutant was indistinguishable with that of WT at normal growth temperature, it was markedly retarded at low temperature compared with that of WT. Our data indicated the possibility that cyanobacterial monogalactosyldiacylglycerol-synthesis pathway might be required for the adequate unsaturation level of fatty acids in galactolipids and affect the low-temperature sensitivity.

Versican 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) promotes dermal wound repair and fibroblast migration by regulating miRNA activity,

Abstract: Versican is an extracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan which functions as a structural molecule but can also regulate a variety of cellular activities. This study was designed to explore the roles of versican in the process of dermal wound repair. To elevate levels of versican, we ectopically expressed the versican 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) as a competitive endogenous RNA to modulate expression of versican. We demonstrated that wounds closed faster in transgenic mice expressing the versican 3′UTR, as compared to those in wildtype mice. We stably expressed versican 3′UTR in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and found that the 3′UTR-transfected cells showed increased migratory capacity relative to vector-transfected cells. Interestingly, we found that the 3′UTRs of versican and β-catenin shared common microRNAs (miRNAs) including miR-185, miR-203*, miR-690, miR-680, and miR-434-3p. Luciferase assays showed that all of these miRNAs could target the 3′UTRs of both versican and β-catenin, when the luciferase constructs contained fragments harboring the miRNA binding sites. As a consequence, expression of both versican and β-catenin was up-regulated, which was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Transfection with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the versican 3′UTR abolished the 3′UTR's effects on cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that versican plays important roles in wound repair and that versican messenger RNAs (mRNAs) could compete with endogenous RNAs for regulating miRNA functions.

Abstract: Discoidal high-density lipoproteins (D-HDL) are critical intermediates in reverse cholesterol transport. Most of the present knowledge of D-HDL is based on studies with reconstituted lipoprotein complexes of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) obtained by cholate dialysis (CD). D-HDL can also be generated by the direct microsolubilization (DM) of phospholipid vesicles at the gel/fluid phase transition temperature, a process mechanistically similar to the “in vivo” apoAI lipidation via ABCA1. We compared the apoA-I configuration in D-HDL reconstituted with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine by both procedures using fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements with apoA-I tryptophan mutants and fluorescently labeled cysteine mutants. Results indicate that apoA-I configuration in D-HDL depends on the reconstitution process and are consistent with a “double belt” molecular arrangement with different helix registry. As reported by others, a configuration with juxtaposition of helices 5 of each apoAI monomer (5/5 registry) predominates in D-HDL obtained by CD. However, a configuration with helix 5 of one monomer juxtaposed with helix 2 of the other (5/2 registry) would predominate in D-HDL generated by DM. Moreover, we also show that the kinetics of cholesterol efflux from macrophage cultures depends on the reconstitution process, suggesting that apoAI configuration is important for this HDL function.

Abstract: Mice deficient in group 1b phospholipase A2 have decreased plasma lysophosphatidylcholine and increased hepatic oxidation that is inhibited by intraperitoneal lysophosphatidylcholine injection. This study sought to identify a mechanism for lysophosphatidylcholine-mediated inhibition of hepatic oxidative function. Results showed that in vitro incubation of isolated mitochondria with 40–200μM lysophosphatidylcholine caused cyclosporine A-resistant swelling in a concentration-dependent manner. However, when mitochondria were challenged with 220μM CaCl2, cyclosporine A protected against permeability transition induced by 40μM, but not 80μM lysophosphatidylcholine. Incubation with 40–120μM lysophosphatidylcholine also increased mitochondrial permeability to 75μM CaCl2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite incubation with 80μM lysophosphatidylcholine, the mitochondrial membrane potential was steady in the presence of succinate, and oxidation rates and respiratory control indices were similar to controls in the presence of succinate, glutamate/malate, and palmitoyl-carnitine. However, mitochondrial oxidation rates were inhibited by 30–50% at 100μM lysophosphatidylcholine. Finally, while 40μM lysophosphatidylcholine has no effect on fatty acid oxidation and mitochondria remained impermeable in intact hepatocytes, 100μM lysophosphatidylcholine inhibited fatty acid stimulated oxidation and caused intracellular mitochondrial permeability. Taken together, these present data demonstrated that LPC concentration dependently modulates mitochondrial microenvironment, with low micromolar concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine sufficient to change hepatic oxidation rate whereas higher concentrations are required to disrupt mitochondrial integrity.

Intrinsic differences in BRITE adipogenesis of primary adipocytes from two different mouse strains,

Abstract: BRITE (brown-in-white) cells are brown adipocyte-like cells found in white adipose tissue (WAT) of rodents and/or humans. The recruitment of BRITE adipocytes, referred to as the browning of WAT, is hallmarked by the expression of UCP1 and exerts beneficial metabolic effects. Here we address whether beyond systemic cues depot- and strain-specific variation in BRITE recruitment is determined by a cellular program intrinsic to progenitors. Therefore we compared the browning capacity of serum and investigated brown and BRITE adipogenesis in primary cultures of stromal-vascular cells isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in two inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J (B6, a strain with low browning propensity) and 129/S6SvEv (129, a strain with high browning propensity). Paradoxically, serum collected from B6 mice was more potent in the promotion of browning than serum collected from 129 mice. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that depot- and strain-specific differences observed in vivo are pheno-copied in primary cultures in vitro, as judged by UCP1 expression and by functional analysis. Notably, primary adipocytes from 129 mice had a higher capacity for isoproterenol-induced uncoupled respiration than B6. We conclude that cues intrinsic to the progenitor cells contribute to differential BRITE adipogenesis. Further analyses demonstrate that these cues are independent of autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, BRITE progenitor abundance and genetic variation in the gene regulatory region of Ucp1 but rather depend on trans-acting factors. These results provide new insights on the molecular basis of strain and depot-specific differences in BRITE adipogenesis.

cis-Prenyltransferase AtCPT6 produces a family of very short-chain polyisoprenoids in planta,

Abstract: cis-Prenyltransferases (CPTs) comprise numerous enzymes synthesizing isoprenoid hydrocarbon skeleton with isoprenoid units in the cis (Z) configuration. The chain-length specificity of a particular plant CPT is in most cases unknown despite the composition of the accumulated isoprenoids in the tissue of interest being well established. In this report AtCPT6, one of the nine Arabidopsis thaliana CPTs, is shown to catalyze the synthesis of a family of very short-chain polyisoprenoid alcohols of six, seven, and eight isoprenoid units, those of seven units dominating. The product specificity of AtCPT6 was established in vivo following its expression in the heterologous system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was confirmed by the absence of specific products in AtCPT6 T-DNA insertion mutants and their overaccumulation in AtCPT6-overexpressing plants. These observations are additionally validated in silico using an AtCPT6 model obtained by homology modeling. AtCPT6 only partially complements the function of the yeast homologue of CPT-Rer2 since it restores the growth but not protein glycosylation in rer2Δ yeast. This is the first in planta characterization of specific products of a plant CPT producing polyisoprenoids. Their distribution suggests that a joint activity of several CPTs is required to produce the complex mixture of polyisoprenoid alcohols found in Arabidopsis roots.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle differentiation requires activity of the apoptotic protease caspase-3. We attempted to identify the source of caspase activation in differentiating C2C12 skeletal myoblasts. In addition to caspase-3, caspase-2 was transiently activated during differentiation; however, no changes were observed in caspase-8 or -9 activity. Although mitochondrial Bax increased, this was matched by Bcl-2, resulting in no change to the mitochondrial Bax:Bcl-2 ratio early during differentiation. Interestingly, mitochondrial membrane potential increased on a timeline similar to caspase activation and was accompanied by an immediate, temporary reduction in cytosolic Smac and cytochrome c. Since XIAP protein expression dramatically declined during myogenesis, we investigated whether this contributes to caspase-3 activation. Despite reducing caspase-3 activity by up to 57%, differentiation was unaffected in cells overexpressing normal or E3-mutant XIAP. Furthermore, a XIAP mutant which can inhibit caspase-9 but not caspase-3 did not reduce caspase-3 activity or affect differentiation. Administering a chemical caspase-3 inhibitor demonstrated that complete enzyme inhibition was required to impair myogenesis. These results suggest that neither mitochondrial apoptotic signaling nor XIAP degradation is responsible for transient caspase-3 activation during C2C12 differentiation.

Abstract: Based on results from a signal sequence trap, we investigated chemerin gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Male NMRI mice were exposed to 30, 22 or 4°C for 3weeks, or were fed control (chow) diet, cafeteria diet or high-fat diet at thermoneutrality for the same time. In brown adipose tissue, cold acclimation strongly diminished chemerin gene expression, whereas obesogenic diets augmented expression. Qualitatively, changes in expression were paralleled in brite/beige adipose tissues (e.g. inguinal), whereas white adipose tissue (epididymal) and muscle did not react to these cues. Changes in tissue expression were not directly paralleled by alterations in plasma levels. Both these intact animal studies and brown adipocyte cell culture studies indicated that the gene expression regulation was not congruent with a sympathetic/adrenergic control. The data are discussed in relation to suggested endocrine, paracrine and autocrine effects of chemerin.

Abstract: Observations that Glioma-associated transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 (Gli1/2), executers of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway and targets of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) signaling axis, are involved in numerous developmental and pathological processes unveil them as attractive pharmaceutical targets. Unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase Ulk3 has been suggested to play kinase activity dependent and independent roles in the control of Gli proteins in the context of the Shh signaling pathway. This study aimed at investigating whether the mechanism of generation of Gli1/2 transcriptional activators has similarities regardless of the signaling cascade evoking their activation. We also elucidate further the role of Ulk3 kinase in regulation of Gli1/2 proteins and examine SU6668 as an inhibitor of Ulk3 catalytic activity and a compound targeting Gli1/2 proteins in different cell-based experimental models. Here we demonstrate that Ulk3 is required not only for maintenance of basal levels of Gli1/2 proteins but also for TGF-β or Shh dependent activation of endogenous Gli1/2 proteins in human adipose tissue derived multipotent stromal cells (ASCs) and mouse immortalized progenitor cells, respectively. We show that cultured ASCs possess the functional Shh signaling axis and differentiate towards osteoblasts in response to Shh. Also, we demonstrate that similarly to Ulk3 RNAi, SU6668 prevents de novo expression of Gli1/2 proteins and antagonizes the Gli-dependent activation of the gene expression programs induced by either Shh or TGF-β. Our data suggest SU6668 as an efficient inhibitor of Ulk3 kinase allowing manipulation of the Gli-dependent transcriptional outcome.

Abstract: Eicosanoids play an important role in inducing complex and crucial physiological processes in animals. Eicosanoid biosynthesis in animals is widely reported; however, eicosanoid production in invertebrate tissue is remarkably different to vertebrates and in certain respects remains elusive. We, for the first time, compared the orthologs involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in 14 species of invertebrates and 3 species of vertebrates. Based on parsimony, a complex AA-metabolic system may have existed in the common ancestor of the Metazoa, and then expanded and diversified through invertebrate lineages. A primary vertebrate-like AA-metabolic system via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways was further identified in the basal chordate, amphioxus. The expression profiling of AA-metabolic enzymes and lipidomic analysis of eicosanoid production in the tissues of amphioxus supported our supposition. Thus, we proposed that the ancestral complexity of AA-metabolic network diversified with the different lineages of invertebrates, adapting with the diversity of body plans and ecological opportunity, and arriving at the vertebrate-like pattern in the basal chordate, amphioxus.

Abstract: Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a naturally occurring phospholipid mediator and an analog of the growth factor-like phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). cPA has a unique cyclic phosphate ring at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of its glycerol backbone. We showed before that a metabolically stabilized cPA derivative, 2-carba-cPA, relieved osteoarthritis pathogenesis in vivo and induced hyaluronic acid synthesis in human osteoarthritis synoviocytes in vitro. This study focused on hyaluronic acid synthesis in human fibroblasts, which retain moisture and maintain health in the dermis. We investigated the effects of cPA and LPA on hyaluronic acid synthesis in human fibroblasts (NB1RGB cells). Using particle exclusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found that both cPA and LPA dose-dependently induced hyaluronic acid synthesis. We revealed that the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 messenger RNA and protein is up-regulated by cPA and LPA treatment time dependently. We then characterized the signaling pathways up-regulating hyaluronic acid synthesis mediated by cPA and LPA in NB1RGB cells. Pharmacological inhibition and reporter gene assays revealed that the activation of the LPA receptor LPAR1, Gi/o protein, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) but not nuclear factor κB induced hyaluronic acid synthesis by the treatment with cPA and LPA in NB1RGB cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that cPA and LPA induce hyaluronic acid synthesis in human skin fibroblasts mainly through the activation of LPAR1-Gi/o followed by the PI3K, ERK, and CREB signaling pathway.
