Abstract: Summary
The Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) cofactor Cdh1 modulates cell proliferation by targeting multiple cell-cycle regulators for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Lack of Cdh1 results in structural and numerical chromosome aberrations, a hallmark of genomic instability. By using a proteomic approach in Cdh1-null cells and mouse tissues, we have identified kinesin Eg5 and topoisomerase 2α as Cdh1 targets involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. These proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded through specific KEN and D boxes in a Cdh1-dependent manner. Whereas Cdh1-null cells display partial resistance to Eg5 inhibitors such as monastrol, lack of Cdh1 results in a dramatic sensitivity to Top2α poisons as a consequence of increased levels of trapped Top2α-DNA complexes. Chemical inhibition of the APC/C in cancer cells results in increased sensitivity to Top2α poisons. This work identifies in vivo targets of the mammalian APC/C-Cdh1 complex and reveals synthetic lethal interactions of relevance in anticancer treatments.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA helicases DDX5 and DDX17 are members of a large family of highly conserved proteins that are involved in gene-expression regulation; however, their in vivo targets and activities in biological processes such as cell differentiation, which requires reprogramming of gene-expression programs at multiple levels, are not well characterized. Here, we uncovered a mechanism by which DDX5 and DDX17 cooperate with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H/F splicing factors to define epithelial- and myoblast-specific splicing subprograms. We then observed that downregulation of DDX5 and DDX17 protein expression during myogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation contributes to the switching of splicing programs during these processes. Remarkably, this downregulation is mediated by the production of miRNAs induced upon differentiation in a DDX5/DDX17-dependent manner. Since DDX5 and DDX17 also function as coregulators of master transcriptional regulators of differentiation, we propose to name these proteins “master orchestrators” of differentiation that dynamically orchestrate several layers of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Calcineurin is a heteromeric Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. It dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in the cytoplasm, which subsequently undergoes nuclear translocation. NFAT regulates numerous biological processes, including inflammatory T cell responses and cardiac development. Our study identifies the Cysteine-Rich with EGF-Like Domains 1 (Creld1) gene as a regulator of calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling. We show that Creld1 is sufficient to promote NFATc1 dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus. Creld1 is contained in a joint protein complex with the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CnB, thereby controlling calcineurin function. Localization of Creld1 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is important to exert its action on calcineurin. By using Creld1KO mice, we demonstrate that Creld1 is essential for heart development. Creld1 function is required for the VEGF-dependent proliferation of endocardial cells by promoting the expression of NFATc1 target-genes. Collectively, our study identifies Creld1 as an important regulator of calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed necrotic cell death induced by the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) family of cytokines is dependent on a kinase cascade consisting of receptor-interacting kinases RIP1 and RIP3. How these kinase activities cause cells to die by necrosis is not known. The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein MLKL is a functional RIP3 substrate that binds to RIP3 through its kinase-like domain but lacks kinase activity of its own. RIP3 phosphorylates MLKL at the T357 and S358 sites. Reported here is the development of a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated MLKL in cells dying of this pathway and in human liver biopsy samples from patients suffering from drug-induced liver injury. The phosphorylated MLKL forms an oligomer that binds to phosphatidylinositol lipids and cardiolipin. This property allows MLKL to move from the cytosol to the plasma and intracellular membranes, where it directly disrupts membrane integrity, resulting in necrotic death.

Abstract: Summary
To identify regulatory drivers of prostate cancer malignancy, we have assembled genome-wide regulatory networks (interactomes) for human and mouse prostate cancer from expression profiles of human tumors and of genetically engineered mouse models, respectively. Cross-species computational analysis of these interactomes has identified FOXM1 and CENPF as synergistic master regulators of prostate cancer malignancy. Experimental validation shows that FOXM1 and CENPF function synergistically to promote tumor growth by coordinated regulation of target gene expression and activation of key signaling pathways associated with prostate cancer malignancy. Furthermore, co-expression of FOXM1 and CENPF is a robust prognostic indicator of poor survival and metastasis. Thus, genome-wide cross-species interrogation of regulatory networks represents a valuable strategy to identify causal mechanisms of human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The mutagenic effect of hepatitis B (HBV) integration in predisposing risk to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of HBV-positive HCC cell lines and showed transcription of viral-human gene fusions from the site of genome integrations. We discovered tumor-promoting properties of a chimeric HBx-LINE1 that, intriguingly, functions as a hybrid RNA. HBx-LINE1 can be detected in 23.3% of HBV-associated HCC tumors and correlates with poorer patient survival. HBx-LINE1 transgenic mice showed heightened susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine-induced tumor formation. We further show that HBx-LINE1 expression affects β-catenin transactivity, which underlines a role in activating Wnt signaling. Thus, this study identifies a viral-human chimeric fusion transcript that functions like a long noncoding RNA to promote HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Internal organs are asymmetrically positioned inside the body. Embryonic motile cilia play an essential role in this process by generating a directional fluid flow inside the vertebrate left-right organizer. Detailed characterization of how fluid flow dynamics modulates laterality is lacking. We used zebrafish genetics to experimentally generate a range of flow dynamics. By following the development of each embryo, we show that fluid flow in the left-right organizer is asymmetric and provides a good predictor of organ laterality. This was tested in mosaic organizers composed of motile and immotile cilia generated by dnah7 knockdowns. In parallel, we used simulations of fluid dynamics to analyze our experimental data. These revealed that fluid flow generated by 30 or more cilia predicts 90% situs solitus, similar to experimental observations. We conclude that cilia number, dorsal anterior motile cilia clustering, and left flow are critical to situs solitus via robust asymmetric charon expression.

Abstract: Summary
Psychological stress-induced hyperthermia (PSH) is a fundamental autonomic stress response observed in many mammalian species. Here we show a hypothalamomedullary, glutamatergic neural pathway for psychological stress signaling that drives the sympathetic thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) that contributes to PSH. Using in vivo drug nanoinjections into rat brain and thermotelemetry, we demonstrate that the rostral medullary raphe region (rMR) and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) mediate a psychosocial stress-induced thermogenesis in BAT and PSH. Functional neuroanatomy indicates that the DMH functions as a hub for stress signaling, with monosynaptic projections to the rMR for sympathetic outputs and to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus for neuroendocrine outputs. Optogenetic experiments showed that the DMH–rMR monosynaptic pathway drives BAT thermogenesis and cardiovascular responses. These findings make an important contribution to our understanding of the central autonomic circuitries linking stress coping with energy homeostasis—potentially underlying the etiology of psychogenic fever, a major psychosomatic symptom.

PP2A-Mediated Regulation of Ras Signaling in G2 Is Essential for Stable Quiescence and Normal G1 Length,

Abstract: Summary
Quiescence (G0) allows cycling cells to reversibly cease proliferation. A decision to enter quiescence is suspected of occurring early in G1, before the restriction point (R). Surprisingly, we have identified G2 as an interval during which inhibition of the protein phosphatase PP2A results in failure to exhibit stable quiescence. This effect is accompanied by shortening of the ensuing G1. The PP2A subcomplex required for stable G0 contains the B56γ B subunit. After PP2A inhibition in G2, aberrant overexpression of cyclin E occurs during mitosis and is responsible for overriding quiescence. Strikingly, suppression of Ras signaling re-establishes normal cyclin E levels during M and restores G0. These data point to PP2A-B56γ-driven Ras signaling modulation in G2 as essential for suppressing aberrant cyclin E expression during mitosis and thereby achieving normal G0 control. Thus, G2 is an interval during which the length and growth factor dependence of the next G1 interval are established.

Abstract: Summary
Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) undergo lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that is transported to the capillary lumen by an endothelial cell protein, GPIHBP1. For LPL-mediated lipolysis to occur, TRLs must bind to the lumen of capillaries. This process is often assumed to involve heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), but we suspected that TRL margination might instead require GPIHBP1. Indeed, TRLs marginate along the heart capillaries of wild-type but not Gpihbp1–/– mice, as judged by fluorescence microscopy, quantitative assays with infrared-dye-labeled lipoproteins, and EM tomography. Both cell-culture and in vivo studies showed that TRL margination depends on LPL bound to GPIHBP1. Notably, the expression of LPL by endothelial cells in Gpihbp1–/– mice did not restore defective TRL margination, implying that the binding of LPL to HSPGs is ineffective in promoting TRL margination. Our studies show that GPIHBP1-bound LPL is the main determinant of TRL margination.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of limb-driven locomotor behaviors was a key event in the evolution of vertebrates and fostered the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. We show that the generation of limb-projecting lateral motor column (LMC) neurons in mice relies on a transcriptional autoregulatory module initiated via transient activity of multiple genes within the HoxA and HoxC clusters. Repression of this module at thoracic levels restricts expression of LMC determinants, thus dictating LMC position relative to the limbs. This suppression is mediated by a key regulatory domain that is specifically found in the Hoxc9 proteins of appendage-bearing vertebrates. The profile of Hoxc9 expression inversely correlates with LMC position in land vertebrates and likely accounts for the absence of LMC neurons in limbless species such as snakes. Thus, modulation of both Hoxc9 protein function and Hoxc9 gene expression likely contributed to evolutionary transitions between undulatory and ambulatory motor circuit connectivity programs.

Abstract: Summary
Steroid hormones act as important developmental switches, and their nuclear receptors regulate many genes. However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different Drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer-activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including Eip74. Our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependent enhancers for different pathways and across organisms.

Capsaicin Ameliorates Cisplatin-Induced Renal Injury through Induction of Heme Oxygenase-1,

Abstract: Cisplatin is one of the most potent chemotherapy agents. However, its use is limited due to its toxicity in normal tissues, including the kidney and ear. In particular, nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin is closely associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme metabolism, has been implicated in a various cellular processes, such as inflammatory injury and anti-oxidant/oxidant homeostasis. Capsaicin is reported to have therapeutic potential in cisplatin-induced renal failures. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective effects on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that administration of capsaicin ameliorates cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction by assessing the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as well as tissue histology. In addition, capsaicin treatment attenuates the expression of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress markers for renal damage. We also found that capsaicin induces HO-1 expression in kidney tissues and HK-2 cells. Notably, the protective effects of capsaicin were completely abrogated by treatment with either the HO inhibitor ZnPP IX or HO-1 knockdown in HK-2 cells. These results suggest that capsaicin has protective effects against cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction through induction of HO-1 as well as inhibition oxidative stress and inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular transformation by oncogenic RAS engages the MAPK pathway under strict regulation by the scaffold protein KSR-1. Here, we report that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 plays a critical role in a positive feedback loop for the RAS/MAPK pathway independent of its RhoGEF activity. GEF-H1 acts as an adaptor protein linking the PP2A B’ subunits to KSR-1, thereby mediating the dephosphorylation of KSR-1 S392 and activation of MAPK signaling. GEF-H1 is important for the growth and survival of HRASV12-transformed cells and pancreatic tumor xenografts. GEF-H1 expression is induced by oncogenic RAS and is correlated with pancreatic neoplastic progression. Our results, therefore, identify GEF-H1 as an amplifier of MAPK signaling and provide mechanistic insight into the progression of RAS mutant tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unique in that they have the capacity to differentiate into all of the cell types in the body. We know a lot about the complex transcriptional control circuits that maintain the naive pluripotent state under self-renewing conditions but comparatively less about how cells exit from this state in response to differentiation stimuli. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Mechanistically, Oct4 is required for Otx2 expression, and reciprocally, Otx2 is required for efficient Oct4 recruitment to many enhancer regions. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Injection of the peptide hormone ghrelin stimulates food intake in mice and humans. However, mice born without ghrelin demonstrate no significant loss of appetite. This paradox suggests either that compensation develops in mice born without ghrelin or that ghrelin is not essential for appetite control. To distinguish these possibilities, we generated transgenic mice (Ghrl-DTR) that express the diphtheria toxin receptor in ghrelin-secreting cells. Injection of diphtheria toxin in adulthood ablated ghrelin cells and reduced plasma ghrelin by 80%–95%. Ghrelin cell-ablated mice exhibited no loss of appetite or body weight and no resistance to a high-fat diet. To stimulate food intake in mice by ghrelin injection, we had to raise plasma levels many-fold above normal. Like germline ghrelin-deficient mice, the ghrelin cell-ablated mice developed profound hypoglycemia when subjected to prolonged calorie restriction, confirming that ghrelin acts to maintain blood glucose under famine conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) control immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. Treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) has been shown to increase Treg cell frequency, but the mechanisms of their action on Treg cell induction are largely unknown. Here, we report that glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a protein induced by GCs, promotes Treg cell production. In mice, GILZ overexpression causes an increase in Treg cell number, whereas GILZ deficiency results in impaired generation of peripheral Treg cells (pTreg), associated with increased spontaneous and experimental intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, we found that GILZ is required for GCs to cooperate with TGF-β in FoxP3 induction, while it enhances TGF-β signaling by binding to and promoting Smad2 phosphorylation and activation of FoxP3 expression. Thus, our results establish an essential GILZ-mediated link between the anti-inflammatory action of GCs and the regulation of TGF-β-dependent pTreg production.

Abstract: Summary
During epithelial tissue morphogenesis, developmental progenitor cells undergo dynamic adhesive and cytoskeletal remodeling to trigger proliferation and migration. Transcriptional mechanisms that restrict such a mild form of epithelial plasticity to maintain lineage-restricted differentiation in committed epithelial tissues are poorly understood. Here, we report that simultaneous ablation of transcriptional repressor-encoding Ovol1 and Ovol2 results in expansion and blocked terminal differentiation of embryonic epidermal progenitor cells. Conversely, mice overexpressing Ovol2 in their skin epithelia exhibit precocious differentiation accompanied by smaller progenitor cell compartments. We show that Ovol1/Ovol2-deficient epidermal cells fail to undertake α-catenin-driven actin cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesive maturation and exhibit changes that resemble epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Remarkably, these alterations and defective terminal differentiation are reversed upon depletion of EMT-promoting transcriptional factor Zeb1. Collectively, our findings reveal Ovol-Zeb1-α-catenin sequential repression and highlight Ovol1 and Ovol2 as gatekeepers of epithelial adhesion and differentiation by inhibiting progenitor-like traits and epithelial plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Prion and prion-like domains (PLDs) are found in many proteins throughout the animal kingdom. We found that the PLD in the S. cerevisiae exomer-dependent cargo protein Pin2 is involved in the regulation of protein transport and localization. The domain serves as a Pin2 retention signal in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Pin2 is localized in a polarized fashion at the plasma membrane of the bud early in the cell cycle and the bud neck at cytokinesis. This polarized localization is dependent on both exo- and endocytosis. Upon environmental stress, Pin2 is rapidly endocytosed, and the PLD aggregates and causes sequestration of Pin2. The aggregation of Pin2 is reversible upon stress removal and Pin2 is rapidly re-exported to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these data uncover a role for PLDs as protein localization elements.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal respiratory metabolism plays a role in numerous human disorders. We find that regulation of overall histone acetylation is perturbed in respiratory-incompetent (ρ0) yeast. Because histone acetylation is highly sensitive to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) availability, we sought interventions that suppress this ρ0 phenotype through reprogramming metabolism. Nutritional intervention studies led to the discovery that genetic coactivation of the mitochondrion-to-nucleus retrograde (RTG) response and the AMPK (Snf1) pathway prevents abnormal histone deacetylation in ρ0 cells. Metabolic profiling of signaling mutants uncovered links between chromatin-dependent phenotypes of ρ0 cells and metabolism of ATP, acetyl-CoA, glutathione, branched-chain amino acids, and the storage carbohydrate trehalose. Importantly, RTG/AMPK activation reprograms energy metabolism to increase the supply of acetyl-CoA to lysine acetyltransferases and extend the chronological lifespan of ρ0 cells. Our results strengthen the framework for rational design of nutrient supplementation schemes and drug-discovery initiatives aimed at mimicking the therapeutic benefits of dietary interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial fusion is essential for maintenance of mitochondrial function. The mitofusin GTPases control mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, whereas the dynamin-related GTPase Opa1 mediates inner membrane fusion. We show that mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is tuned by the level of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas outer membrane fusion is insensitive. Consequently, cells from patients with pathogenic mtDNA mutations show a selective defect in mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. In elucidating the molecular mechanism of OXPHOS-stimulated fusion, we uncover that real-time proteolytic processing of Opa1 stimulates mitochondrial inner membrane fusion. OXPHOS-stimulated mitochondrial fusion operates through Yme1L, which cleaves Opa1 more efficiently under high OXPHOS conditions. Engineered cleavage of Opa1 is sufficient to mediate inner membrane fusion, regardless of respiratory state. Proteolytic cleavage therefore stimulates the membrane fusion activity of Opa1, and this feature is exploited to dynamically couple mitochondrial fusion to cellular metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The acyl-chain composition of the major mammalian phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) is distinct in various tissues. Although it was classically suggested that PC diversity is acquired through acyl-chain remodeling, the mechanisms and biological relevance of acyl-chain diversity remain unclear. Here, we show that differences in the substrate selectivity of lysophospholipid acyltransferases regulate tissue PC acyl-chain composition through contribution of both the de novo and remodeling pathways, depending on the fatty acid species. Unexpectedly, while dipalmitoyl-PC (DPPC) is enriched through the remodeling pathway, several polyunsaturated PC molecules accumulate during the de novo pathway. We confirmed this concept for DPPC in pulmonary surfactant and showed that the biophysical properties of this lipid are important to prevent the early onset of acute lung injury. We propose a model of harmonized processes for phospholipid diversification to satisfy in vivo requirements, with an example of its biological relevance.

Abstract: Cardiogenesis depends on a tightly regulated balance between proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and their cardiomyocyte descendants. While exposure of early mouse embryos to Ca2+ channel antagonists has been associated with abnormal cardiac morphogenesis, less is known about the consequences of Ca2+ channel blockade on proliferation and differentiation of CPCs at the cellular level. Here we showed that at embryonic day (E) 11.5, the murine ventricles express several L-type and T-type Ca2+ channel isoforms, and that the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonist, nifedipine, blunts isoproterenol induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. Nifedipine mediated Ca2+ channel blockade was associated with a reduction in cell cycle activity of E11.5 CPCs and impaired assembly of the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus. Furthermore, in cell transplantation experiments, systemic administration of nifedipine to adult mice receiving transplanted E11.5 ventricular cells (containing CPCs and cardiomyocytes) was associated with smaller graft sizes compared to vehicle treated control animals. These data suggest that intracellular Ca2+ is a critical regulator of the balance between CPC proliferation and differentiation and demonstrate that interactions between pharmacological drugs and transplanted cells could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of cell based therapies for myocardial repair.

Abstract: Summary
To exert regulatory function, miRNAs guide Argonaute (AGO) proteins to partially complementary sites on target RNAs. Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays are state-of-the-art to map AGO binding sites, but assigning the targeting miRNA to these sites relies on bioinformatics predictions and is therefore indirect. To directly and unambiguously identify miRNA:target site interactions, we modified our CLIP methodology in C. elegans to experimentally ligate miRNAs to their target sites. Unexpectedly, ligation reactions also occurred in the absence of the exogenous ligase. Our in vivo data set and reanalysis of published mammalian AGO-CLIP data for miRNA-chimeras yielded ∼17,000 miRNA:target site interactions. Analysis of interactions and extensive experimental validation of chimera-discovered targets of viral miRNAs suggest that our strategy identifies canonical, noncanonical, and nonconserved miRNA:targets. About 80% of miRNA interactions have perfect or partial seed complementarity. In summary, analysis of miRNA:target chimeras enables the systematic, context-specific, in vivo discovery of miRNA binding.

Abstract: Placenta is a transitional area making many physiological activities between mother and fetus and therefore, it is a critical organ influencing the outcome of pregnancy. Fetal growth is directly related to placental development. Accurate placental development depends on coordinated action of trophoblasts’ proliferation, differentiation and invasion. Information on cell cycle related proteins that control these events is limited and how they are affected in preeclampsia is not fully understood yet. Therefore, in this study, in order to understand the role of cell cycle regulators in preeclamptic placentas we aimed to determine the spatio-temporal immunolocalizations of cell cycle regulators in preeclamptic and normal human term placentas. Term placentas were obtained from women diagnosed with preeclampsia and from normal pregnancies with informed consent following cesarean deliveries. Placental samples were stained via immunohistochemistry with PCNA, Ki67, p27, p57, vimentin and cytokeratin 7 antibodies and were examined by light microscopy. PCNA and Ki67 staining intensities significantly increased in villous parts, significantly decreased in basal plates of PE group and did not change in chorionic plates. Staining intensities of cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p57 significantly increased in all parts of preeclamptic placentas compared to control. Placental abnormalities of preeclamptic placentas might be associated with proliferation and cell cycle arrest mechanisms’ alterations occurred in preeclampsia.

Abstract: Summary
The linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly complex (LUBAC) generates Met1-linked “linear” Ub chains that regulate the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factor and other processes. We recently discovered OTULIN as a deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves Met1-linked polyUb. Now, we show that OTULIN binds via a conserved PUB-interacting motif (PIM) to the PUB domain of the LUBAC component HOIP. Crystal structures and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal the molecular basis for the high-affinity interaction and explain why OTULIN binds the HOIP PUB domain specifically. Analysis of LUBAC-induced NFκB signaling suggests that OTULIN needs to be present on LUBAC in order to restrict Met1-polyUb signaling. Moreover, LUBAC-OTULIN complex formation is regulated by OTULIN phosphorylation in the PIM. Phosphorylation of OTULIN prevents HOIP binding, whereas unphosphorylated OTULIN is part of the endogenous LUBAC complex. Our work exemplifies how coordination of ubiquitin assembly and disassembly activities in protein complexes regulates individual Ub linkage types.

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is primarily caused by lethal heart disorders resulting in structural and arrhythmogenic abnormalities, is one of the prevalent modes of death in most developed countries. Myocardial ischemia, mainly due to coronary artery disease, is the most common type of heart disease leading to SCD. However, postmortem diagnosis of SCD is frequently complicated by obscure histological evidence. Here, we show that certain mRNA species, namely those encoding hemoglobin A1/2 and B (Hba1/2 and Hbb, respectively) as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), exhibit distinct postmortem expression patterns in the left ventricular free wall of SCD subjects when compared with their expression patterns in the corresponding tissues from control subjects with non-cardiac causes of death. Hba1/2 and Hbb mRNA expression levels were higher in ischemic SCD cases with acute myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease without recent infarction, and even in cardiac death subjects without apparent pathological signs of heart injuries, than control subjects. By contrast, Pdk4 mRNA was expressed at lower levels in SCD subjects. In conclusion, we found that altered myocardial Hba1/2, Hbb, and Pdk4 mRNA expression patterns can be employed as molecular signatures of fatal cardiac dysfunction to forensically implicate SCD as the primary cause of death.

Abstract: Summary
Altered cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function are major features of several diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Given this important link to human health, we sought to define proteins within mitochondria that are critical for maintaining homeostatic ATP levels. We screened an RNAi library targeting >1,000 nuclear-encoded genes whose protein products localize to the mitochondria in multiple metabolic conditions in order to examine their effects on cellular ATP levels. We identified a mechanism by which electron transport chain (ETC) perturbation under glycolytic conditions increased ATP production through enhanced glycolytic flux, thereby highlighting the cellular potential for metabolic plasticity. Additionally, we identified a mitochondrial adenylate kinase (AK4) that regulates cellular ATP levels and AMPK signaling and whose expression significantly correlates with glioma patient survival. This study maps the bioenergetic landscape of >1,000 mitochondrial proteins in the context of varied metabolic substrates and begins to link key metabolic genes with clinical outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Specific protein-RNA interactions guide posttranscriptional gene regulation. Here, we describe RNA Bind-n-Seq (RBNS), a method that comprehensively characterizes sequence and structural specificity of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), and its application to the developmental alternative splicing factors RBFOX2, CELF1/CUGBP1, and MBNL1. For each factor, we recovered both canonical motifs and additional near-optimal binding motifs. RNA secondary structure inhibits binding of RBFOX2 and CELF1, while MBNL1 favors unpaired Us but tolerates C/G pairing in motifs containing UGC and/or GCU. Dissociation constants calculated from RBNS data using a novel algorithm correlated highly with values measured by surface plasmon resonance. Motifs identified by RBNS were conserved, were bound and active in vivo, and distinguished the subset of motifs enriched by CLIP-Seq that had regulatory activity. Together, our data demonstrate that RBNS complements crosslinking-based methods and show that in vivo binding and activity of these splicing factors is driven largely by intrinsic RNA affinity.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is hampered by the lack of early, sensitive, and objective laboratory tests. We describe a sensitive method for biochemical diagnosis of AD based on specific detection of misfolded Aβ oligomers, which play a central role in AD pathogenesis. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay (Aβ-PMCA), exploits the functional property of Aβ oligomers to seed the polymerization of monomeric Aβ. Aβ-PMCA allowed detection of as little as 3 fmol of Aβ oligomers. Most importantly, using cerebrospinal fluid, we were able to distinguish AD patients from control individuals affected by a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders or nondegenerative neurological diseases with overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. These findings provide the proof-of-principle basis for developing a highly sensitive and specific biochemical test for AD diagnosis.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophage infiltration has been identified as an independent poor prognostic factor in several cancer types. The major survival factor for these macrophages is macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1). We generated a monoclonal antibody (RG7155) that inhibits CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) activation. In vitro RG7155 treatment results in cell death of CSF-1-differentiated macrophages. In animal models, CSF-1R inhibition strongly reduces F4/80+ tumor-associated macrophages accompanied by an increase of the CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio. Administration of RG7155 to patients led to striking reductions of CSF-1R+CD163+ macrophages in tumor tissues, which translated into clinical objective responses in diffuse-type giant cell tumor (Dt-GCT) patients.

Abstract: Summary
The close vicinity of cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) at the invasive front of tumors suggests that these two cell type may mutually interact. We show that mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells activate macrophages to a TAM-like phenotype by GM-CSF. Reciprocally, CCL18 from TAMs induces cancer cell EMT, forming a positive feedback loop, in coculture systems and humanized mice. Inhibition of GM-CSF or CCL18 breaks this loop and reduces cancer metastasis. High GM-CSF expression in breast cancer samples is associated with more CCL18+ macrophages, cancer cell EMT, enhanced metastasis, and reduced patient survival. These findings suggest that a positive feedback loop between GM-CSF and CCL18 is important in breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Inappropriate MET tyrosine kinase receptor signaling is detected in almost all types of human cancer and contributes to malignant growth and MET dependency via proliferative and antiapoptotic activities. Independently, Tensin-4 (TNS4) is emerging as a putative oncogene in many cancer types, but the mechanisms of TNS4 oncogenic activity are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that TNS4 directly interacts with phosphorylated MET via the TNS4 SH2-domain to positively regulate cell survival, proliferation, and migration, through increased MET protein stability. In addition, TNS4 interaction with β1-integrin cytoplasmic tail positively regulates β1-integrin stability. Loss of TNS4 or disruption of MET-TNS4 interaction triggers MET trafficking toward the lysosomal compartment that is associated with excessive degradation of MET and triggers MET-addicted carcinoma cell death in vitro and in vivo. Significant correlation between MET and TNS4 expression in human colon carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma suggests TNS4 plays a critical role in MET stability in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The quiescent center (QC) maintains the activity of the surrounding stem cells within the root stem cell niche, yet specific molecular players sustaining the low rate of QC cell division remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, BRAVO (BRASSINOSTEROIDS AT VASCULAR AND ORGANIZING CENTER), acting as a cell-specific repressor of QC divisions in the primary root of Arabidopsis. Ectopic BRAVO expression restricts overall root growth and ceases root regeneration upon damage of the stem cells, demonstrating the role of BRAVO in counteracting Brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated cell division in the QC cells. Interestingly, BR-regulated transcription factor BES1 (BRI1-EMS SUPRESSOR 1) directly represses and physically interacts with BRAVO in vivo, creating a switch that modulates QC divisions at the root stem cell niche. Together, our results define a mechanism for BR-mediated regulation of stem cell quiescence in plants.

Abstract: Summary
SecM is an E. coli secretion monitor capable of stalling translation on the prokaryotic ribosome without cofactors. Biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated that the SecM nascent chain interacts with the 50S subunit exit tunnel to inhibit peptide bond formation. However, the timescales and pathways of stalling on an mRNA remain undefined. To provide a dynamic mechanism for stalling, we directly tracked the dynamics of elongation on ribosomes translating the SecM stall sequence (FSTPVWISQAQGIRAGP) using single-molecule fluorescence techniques. Within 1 min, three peptide-ribosome interactions work cooperatively over the last five codons of the SecM sequence, leading to severely impaired elongation rates beginning from the terminal proline and lasting four codons. Our results suggest that stalling is tightly linked to the dynamics of elongation and underscore the roles that the exit tunnel and nascent chain play in controlling fundamental steps in translation.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic cell cycle, driven by both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms, is the central molecular oscillator underlying tissue growth throughout animals. Although genome-wide studies have investigated cell-cycle-associated transcription in unicellular systems, global patterns of periodic transcription in multicellular tissues remain largely unexplored. Here we define the cell-cycle-associated transcriptome of the developing Drosophila wing epithelium and compare it with that of cultured Drosophila S2 cells, revealing a core set of periodic genes and a surprising degree of context specificity in periodic transcription. We further employ RNAi-mediated phenotypic profiling to define functional requirements for more than 300 periodic genes, with a focus on those required for cell proliferation in vivo. Finally, we investigate uncharacterized genes required for interkinetic nuclear migration. Combined, these findings provide a global perspective on cell-cycle control in vivo, and they highlight a critical need to understand the context-specific regulation of cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Thermogenic UCP1-positive cells, which include brown and beige adipocytes, transform chemical energy into heat and increase whole-body energy expenditure. Using a ribosomal profiling approach, we present a comprehensive molecular description of brown and beige gene expression from multiple fat depots in vivo. This UCP1-TRAP data set demonstrates striking similarities and important differences between these cell types, including a smooth muscle-like signature expressed by beige, but not classical brown, adipocytes. In vivo fate mapping using either a constitutive or an inducible Myh11-driven Cre demonstrates that at least a subset of beige cells arise from a smooth muscle-like origin. Finally, ectopic expression of PRDM16 converts bona fide vascular smooth muscle cells into Ucp1-positive adipocytes in vitro. These results establish a portrait of brown and beige adipocyte gene expression in vivo and identify a smooth muscle-like origin for beige cells.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common brain malignancies and has a very poor prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that the presence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in GBM and the rare CSC subpopulation that is resistant to chemotherapy may be responsible for the treatment failure and unfavorable prognosis of GBM. A garlic-derived compound, Z-ajoene, has shown a range of biological activities, including anti-proliferative effects on several cancers. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that Z-ajoene specifically inhibits the growth of the GBM CSC population. CSC sphere-forming inhibition was achieved at a concentration that did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect in regular cell culture conditions. The specificity of this inhibitory effect on the CSC population was confirmed by detecting CSC cell surface marker CD133 expression and biochemical marker ALDH activity. In addition, stem cell-related mRNA profiling and real-time PCR revealed the differential expression of CSC-specific genes, including Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog, upon treatment with Z-ajoene. A proteomic approach, i.e., reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) and Western blot analysis, showed decreased SMAD4, p-AKT, 14.3.3 and FOXO3A expression. The protein interaction map (http://string-db.org/) of the identified molecules suggested that the AKT, ERK/p38 and TGFβ signaling pathways are key mediators of Z–ajoene’s action, which affects the transcriptional network that includes FOXO3A. These biological and bioinformatic analyses collectively demonstrate that Z-ajoene is a potential candidate for the treatment of GBM by specifically targeting GBM CSCs. We also show how this systemic approach strengthens the identification of new therapeutic agents that target CSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 is the most abundant molecular chaperone in the eukaryotic cell. One of the most stringent clients is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), whose in vivo function strictly depends on the interaction with the Hsp90 machinery. However, the molecular mechanism of this interaction has been elusive. Here we have reconstituted the interaction of Hsp90 with hormone-bound GR using purified components. Our biochemical and structural analyses define the binding site for GR on Hsp90 and reveal that binding of GR modulates the conformational cycle of Hsp90. FRET experiments demonstrate that a partially closed form of the Hsp90 dimer is the preferred conformation for interaction. Consistent with this, the conformational cycle of Hsp90 is decelerated, and its ATPase activity decreases. Hsp90 cochaperones differentially affect formation of the Hsp90-GR complex, serving as control elements for cycle progression and revealing an intricate interplay of client and cochaperones as molecular modulators of the Hsp90 machine.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, is a major mechanism involved in mitochondrial quality control via selectively removing damaged or unwanted mitochondria. Interactions between LC3 and mitophagy receptors such as FUNDC1, which harbors an LC3-interacting region (LIR), are essential for this selective process. However, how mitochondrial stresses are sensed to activate receptor-mediated mitophagy remains poorly defined. Here, we identify that the mitochondrially localized PGAM5 phosphatase interacts with and dephosphorylates FUNDC1 at serine 13 (Ser-13) upon hypoxia or carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) treatment. Dephosphorylation of FUNDC1 catalyzed by PGAM5 enhances its interaction with LC3, which is abrogated following knockdown of PGAM5 or the introduction of a cell-permeable unphosphorylated peptide encompassing the Ser-13 and LIR of FUNDC1. We further observed that CK2 phosphorylates FUNDC1 to reverse the effect of PGAM5 in mitophagy activation. Our results reveal a mechanistic signaling pathway linking mitochondria-damaging signals to the dephosphorylation of FUNDC1 by PGAM5, which ultimately induces mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The p53-regulated long noncoding RNA lincRNA-p21 has been proposed to act in trans via several mechanisms ranging from repressing genes in the p53 transcriptional network to regulating mRNA translation and protein stability. To further examine lincRNA-p21 function, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model. We find that lincRNA-p21 predominantly functions in cis to activate expression of its neighboring gene, p21. Mechanistically, we show that lincRNA-p21 acts in concert with hnRNP-K as a coactivator for p53-dependent p21 transcription. Additional phenotypes of lincRNA-p21 deficiency could be attributed to diminished p21 levels, including deregulated expression and altered chromatin state of some Polycomb target genes, a defective G1/S checkpoint, increased proliferation rates, and enhanced reprogramming efficiency. These findings indicate that lincRNA-p21 affects global gene expression and influences the p53 tumor suppressor pathway by acting in cis as a locus-restricted coactivator for p53-mediated p21 expression.

Abstract: Summary
We report that two oncogenes coamplified on chromosome 3q26, PRKCI and SOX2, cooperate to drive a stem-like phenotype in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Protein kinase Cι (PKCι) phosphorylates SOX2, a master transcriptional regulator of stemness, and recruits it to the promoter of Hedgehog (Hh) acyltransferase (HHAT) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in Hh ligand production. PKCι-mediated SOX2 phosphorylation is required for HHAT promoter occupancy, HHAT expression, and maintenance of a stem-like phenotype. Primary LSCC tumors coordinately overexpress PKCι, SOX2, and HHAT and require PKCι-SOX2-HHAT signaling to maintain a stem-like phenotype. Thus, PKCι and SOX2 are genetically, biochemically, and functionally linked in LSCC, and together they drive tumorigenesis by establishing a cell-autonomous Hh signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
Little is understood about the occurrence of somatic genomic alterations in normal tissues and their significance in the context of disease. Here, we identified potential somatic copy number alterations (pSCNAs) in apparently normal ovarian tissue and peripheral blood of 423 ovarian cancer patients. There were, on average, two to four pSCNAs per sample detectable at a tissue-level resolution, although some individuals had orders of magnitude more. Accordingly, we estimated the lower bound of the rate of pSCNAs per cell division. Older individuals and BRCA mutation carriers had more pSCNAs than others. pSCNAs significantly overlapped with Alu and G-quadruplexes, and the affected genes were enriched for signaling and regulation. Some of the amplification/deletion hotspots in pan-cancer genomes were hot spots of pSCNAs in normal tissues as well, suggesting that those regions might be inherently unstable. Prevalence of pSCNA in peripheral blood predicted survival, implying that mutations in normal tissues might have consequences for cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Actin regulators facilitate cell migration by controlling cell protrusion architecture and dynamics. As the behavior of individual actin regulators becomes clear, we must address why cells require multiple regulators with similar functions and how they cooperate to create diverse protrusions. We characterized Diaphanous (Dia) and Enabled (Ena) as a model, using complementary approaches: cell culture, biophysical analysis, and Drosophila morphogenesis. We found that Dia and Ena have distinct biochemical properties that contribute to the different protrusion morphologies each induces. Dia is a more processive, faster elongator, paralleling the long, stable filopodia it induces in vivo, while Ena promotes filopodia with more dynamic changes in number, length, and lifetime. Acting together, Ena and Dia induce protrusions distinct from those induced by either alone, with Ena reducing Dia-driven protrusion length and number. Consistent with this, EnaEVH1 binds Dia directly and inhibits DiaFH1FH2-mediated nucleation in vitro. Finally, Ena rescues hemocyte migration defects caused by activated Dia.

Abstract: Summary
When telomeres become critically short, DNA damage response factors are recruited at chromosome ends, initiating a cellular response to DNA damage. We performed proteomic isolation of chromatin fragments (PICh) in order to define changes in chromatin composition that occur upon onset of acute telomere dysfunction triggered by depletion of the telomere-associated factor TRF2. This unbiased purification of telomere-associated proteins in functional or dysfunctional conditions revealed the dynamic changes in chromatin composition that take place at telomeres upon DNA damage induction. On the basis of our results, we describe a critical role for the polycomb group protein Ring1b in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated end-to-end chromosome fusions. We show that cells with reduced levels of Ring1b have a reduced ability to repair uncapped telomeric chromatin. Our data represent an unbiased isolation of chromatin undergoing DNA damage and are a valuable resource to map the changes in chromatin composition in response to DNA damage activation.

Tissue-Specific Loss of DARS2 Activates Stress Responses Independently of Respiratory Chain Deficiency in the Heart,

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive stress responses activated upon mitochondrial dysfunction are assumed to arise in order to counteract respiratory chain deficiency. Here, we demonstrate that loss of DARS2 (mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) leads to the activation of various stress responses in a tissue-specific manner independently of respiratory chain deficiency. DARS2 depletion in heart and skeletal muscle leads to the severe deregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis followed by a strong respiratory chain deficit in both tissues, yet the activation of adaptive responses is observed predominantly in cardiomyocytes. We show that the impairment of mitochondrial proteostasis in the heart activates the expression of mitokine FGF21, which acts as a signal for cell-autonomous and systemic metabolic changes. Conversely, skeletal muscle has an intrinsic mechanism relying on the slow turnover of mitochondrial transcripts and higher proteostatic buffering capacity. Our results show that mitochondrial dysfunction is sensed independently of respiratory chain deficiency, questioning the current view on the role of stress responses in mitochondrial diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins dynamically define cellular identities through epigenetic repression of key developmental genes. PcG target gene repression can be stabilized through the interaction in the nucleus at PcG foci. Here, we report the results of a high-resolution microscopy genome-wide RNAi screen that identifies 129 genes that regulate the nuclear organization of Pc foci. Candidate genes include PcG components and chromatin factors, as well as many protein-modifying enzymes, including components of the SUMOylation pathway. In the absence of SUMO, Pc foci coagulate into larger aggregates. Conversely, loss of function of the SUMO peptidase Velo disperses Pc foci. Moreover, SUMO and Velo colocalize with PcG proteins at PREs, and Pc SUMOylation affects its chromatin targeting, suggesting that the dynamic regulation of Pc SUMOylation regulates PcG-mediated silencing by modulating the kinetics of Pc binding to chromatin as well as its ability to form Polycomb foci.

Abstract: Summary
Histone acetylation plays important roles in gene regulation, DNA replication, and the response to DNA damage, and it is frequently deregulated in tumors. We postulated that tumor cell histone acetylation levels are determined in part by changes in acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) availability mediated by oncogenic metabolic reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA is dynamically regulated by glucose availability in cancer cells and that the ratio of acetyl-CoA:coenzyme A within the nucleus modulates global histone acetylation levels. In vivo, expression of oncogenic Kras or Akt stimulates histone acetylation changes that precede tumor development. Furthermore, we show that Akt’s effects on histone acetylation are mediated through the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase and that pAkt(Ser473) levels correlate significantly with histone acetylation marks in human gliomas and prostate tumors. The data implicate acetyl-CoA metabolism as a key determinant of histone acetylation levels in cancer cells.

Abstract: This study was undertaken to identify the normal morphologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of skin of the turbot (Psetta maxima L.). In the turbot skin, three morphologically distinct layers were identified: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis was non-keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium that varies in thickness from 5 to 14 cells and 60 to 100μm in size. Goblet cells were seen randomly distributed between malpighian cells in the epidermal layer. These mucous cells were mainly located in the upper third of the epidermis and displayed a spherical to elongated morphology. Dermis was divided in two well-differentiated layers, the superficial stratum laxum and the deeper stratum compactum. Hypodermis was a loose layer mainly composed by adipocytes but we could observe variable amounts of fibroblast, collagen and blood vessels. In turbot two pigmentary layers could be identified: the pigmentary layer of dermis was located between basement membrane and dermis and the pigmentary layer of hypodermis immediately above the muscular layer. Three different types of chromatophores were present: melanophores, iridophores and xanthophores. The main differences observed between groups of fish with different colouration were in the amount of melanophores and xanthophores. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of normal cutaneous biology prior to consideration of specific cutaneous alterations and diseases in turbot.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play important roles in normal hematopoiesis, including erythropoiesis. Although studies have identified several miRNAs that regulate erythroid commitment and differentiation, we do not understand the mechanism by which the crucial erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1and NF-E2 directly regulate and control differentiation via miRNA pathways. In this study, we identified miR-199b-5p as a key regulator of human erythropoiesis, and its expression was up-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Furthermore, the increase of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells occurred in a GATA-1- and NF-E2-dependent manner during erythrocyte maturation. Both GATA-1 and NF-E2 bound upstream of the miR-199b gene locus and activated its transcription. Forced expression of miRNA-199b-5p in K562 cells affected erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, we identified c-Kit as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells. Taken together, our results establish a functional link among the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1/NF-E2, miR-199b-5p and c-Kit, and provide new insights into the coupling of transcription and post-transcription regulation in erythroid differentiation.

Abstract: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs, also called germline stem cells) are self-renewing unipotent stem cells that produce differentiating germ cells in the testis. SSCs can be isolated from the testis and cultured in vitro for long-term periods in the presence of feeder cells (often mouse embryonic fibroblasts). However, the maintenance of SSC feeder culture systems is tedious because preparation of feeder cells is needed at each subculture. In this study, we developed a Matrigel-based feeder-free culture system for long-term propagation of SSCs. Although several in vitro SSC culture systems without feeder cells have been previously described, our Matrigel-based feeder-free culture system is time- and cost- effective, and preserves self-renewability of SSCs. In addition, the growth rate of SSCs cultured using our newly developed system is equivalent to that in feeder cultures. We confirmed that the feeder-free cultured SSCs expressed germ cell markers both at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the functionality of feeder-free cultured SSCs was confirmed by their transplantation into germ cell-depleted mice. These results suggest that our newly developed feeder-free culture system provides a simple approach to maintaining SSCs in vitro and studying the basic biology of SSCs, including determination of their fate.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer is frequently associated with chronic inflammation, with the intestinal epithelial barrier playing an important protective role against the infections and injuries that cause colitis. The p38α pathway regulates inflammatory responses but can also suppress tumor initiation in epithelial cells. We have found that p38α signaling has a dual function in colorectal tumorigenesis. On one side, p38α protects intestinal epithelial cells against colitis-associated colon cancer by regulating intestinal epithelial barrier function. Accordingly, p38α downregulation results in enhanced colitis-induced epithelial damage and inflammation, which potentiates colon tumor formation. Surprisingly, inhibition of p38α in transformed colon epithelial cells reduces tumor burden. Thus, p38α suppresses inflammation-associated epithelial damage and tumorigenesis but contributes to the proliferation and survival of tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Oxysterols are cholesterol metabolites that serve multiple functions in lipid metabolism, including as liver X receptor (LXR) ligands. 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is an abundant oxysterol metabolized by CYP7B1. How 27HC impacts vascular health is unknown. We show that elevations in 27HC via cyp7b1 deletion promote atherosclerosis in apoe−/− mice without altering lipid status; furthermore, estrogen-related atheroprotection is attenuated. In wild-type mice, leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion is increased by 27HC via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent processes. In monocytes/macrophages, 27HC upregulates proinflammatory genes and increases adhesion via ERα. In endothelial cells, 27HC is also proadhesive via ERα, and in contrast to estrogen, which blunts NF-κB activation, 27HC stimulates NF-κB activation via Erk1,2 and JNK-dependent IκBα degradation. Whereas 27HC administration to apoe−/− mice increases atherosclerosis, apoe−/−;erα−/− are unaffected. Thus, 27HC promotes atherosclerosis via proinflammatory processes mediated by ERα, and it attenuates estrogen-related atheroprotection. Strategies to lower 27HC may complement approaches targeting cholesterol to prevent vascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus virulence is regulated when secreted autoinducing peptides (AIPs) are recognized by a membrane-bound receptor histidine kinase (RHK), AgrC. Some AIPs are agonists of virulence gene expression, while others are antagonists. It is unclear how AIP binding regulates AgrC activity. Here, we reconstitute an AgrC family member, AgrC-I, using nanometer-scale lipid bilayer discs. We show that AgrC-I requires membranes rich in anionic lipids to function. The agonist, AIP-I, binds AgrC-I noncooperatively in a 2:2 stoichiometry, while an antagonist ligand, AIP-II, functions as an inverse agonist of the kinase activity. We also demonstrate the kinase and sensor domains in AgrC are connected by a helical linker whose conformational state exercises rheostat-like control over the kinase activity. Binding of agonist or inverse-agonist peptides results in twisting of the linker in different directions. These two observations provide a view of the molecular motions triggered by ligand binding in an intact membrane-bound RHK.

Abstract: Summary
Excluding 53BP1 from chromatin is required to attenuate the DNA damage response during mitosis, yet the functional relevance and regulation of this exclusion are unclear. Here we show that 53BP1 is phosphorylated during mitosis on two residues, T1609 and S1618, located in its well-conserved ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif. Phosphorylating these sites blocks the interaction of the UDR motif with mononuclesomes containing ubiquitinated histone H2A and impedes binding of 53BP1 to mitotic chromatin. Ectopic recruitment of 53BP1-T1609A/S1618A to mitotic DNA lesions was associated with significant mitotic defects that could be reversed by inhibiting nonhomologous end-joining. We also reveal that protein phosphatase complex PP4C/R3β dephosphorylates T1609 and S1618 to allow the recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin in G1 phase. Our results identify key sites of 53BP1 phosphorylation during mitosis, identify the counteracting phosphatase complex that restores the potential for DDR during interphase, and establish the physiological importance of this regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dysregulated glucagon secretion from pancreatic α cells occurs prior to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from β cells. However, whether hyperglucagonemia is causally linked to β cell dysfunction remains unclear. Here we show that glucagon stimulates via cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling hepatic production of the neuropeptide kisspeptin1, which acts on β cells to suppress GSIS. Synthetic kisspeptin suppresses GSIS in vivo in mice and from isolated islets in a kisspeptin1 receptor-dependent manner. Kisspeptin1 is increased in livers and in serum from humans with T2DM and from mouse models of diabetes mellitus. Importantly, liver Kiss1 knockdown in hyperglucagonemic, glucose-intolerant, high-fat-diet fed, and Leprdb/db mice augments GSIS and improves glucose tolerance. These observations indicate a hormonal circuit between the liver and the endocrine pancreas in glycemia regulation and suggest in T2DM a sequential link between hyperglucagonemia via hepatic kisspeptin1 to impaired insulin secretion.

Abstract: Human Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath/epithelial rests of Malassez (HERS/ERM) cells are epithelial remnants of teeth residing in the periodontium. Although the functional roles of HERS/ERM cells have yet to be elucidated, they are a unique epithelial cell population in adult teeth and are reported to have stem cell characteristics. Therefore, HERS/ERM cells might play a role as an epithelial component for the repair or regeneration of dental hard tissues; however, they are very rare population in periodontium and the primary isolation of them is considered to be difficult. To overcome these problems, we immortalized primary HERS/ERM cells isolated from human periodontium using SV40 large T antigen (SV40 LT) and performed a characterization of the immortalized cell line. Primary HERS/ERM cells could not be maintained for more than 6 passages; however, immortalized HERS/ERM cells were maintained for more than 20 passages. There were no differences in the morphological and immunophenotypic characteristics of HERS/ERM cells and immortalized HERS/ERM cells. The expression of epithelial stem cell and embryonic stem cell markers was maintained in immortalized HERS/ERM cells. Moreover, immortalized HERS/ERM cells could acquire mesenchymal phenotypes through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via TGF-β1. In conclusion, we established an immortalized human HERS/ERM cell line with SV40 LT and expect this cell line to contribute to the understanding of the functional roles of HERS/ERM cells and the tissue engineering of teeth.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway, evolutionarily conserved from flies to mammals, promotes cell death and inhibits cell proliferation to regulate organ size. The core component of this cascade, Mst1 in mammalian cells, is sufficient to promote apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying both its activation and its ability to elicit cell death remain largely undefined. We here identify a signaling cassette in cardiac myocytes consisting of K-Ras, the scaffold RASSF1A, and Mst1 that is localized to mitochondria and promotes Mst1 activation in response to oxidative stress. Activated Mst1 phosphorylates Bcl-xL at Ser14, which resides in the BH4 domain, thereby antagonizing Bcl-xL-Bax binding. This, in turn, causes activation of Bax and subsequent mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death. Our findings demonstrate mitochondrial localization of Hippo signaling and identify Bcl-xL as a target that is directly modified to promote apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The interspecies exchange of metabolites plays a key role in the spatiotemporal dynamics of microbial communities. This raises the question of whether ecosystem-level behavior of structured communities can be predicted using genome-scale metabolic models for multiple organisms. We developed a modeling framework that integrates dynamic flux balance analysis with diffusion on a lattice and applied it to engineered communities. First, we predicted and experimentally confirmed the species ratio to which a two-species mutualistic consortium converges and the equilibrium composition of a newly engineered three-member community. We next identified a specific spatial arrangement of colonies, which gives rise to what we term the “eclipse dilemma”: does a competitor placed between a colony and its cross-feeding partner benefit or hurt growth of the original colony? Our experimentally validated finding that the net outcome is beneficial highlights the complex nature of metabolic interactions in microbial communities while at the same time demonstrating their predictability.

The DGCR8 RNA-Binding Heme Domain Recognizes Primary MicroRNAs by Clamping the Hairpin,

Abstract: Summary
Canonical primary microRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) are characterized by a ∼30 bp hairpin flanked by single-stranded regions. These pri-miRNAs are recognized and cleaved by the Microprocessor complex consisting of the Drosha nuclease and its obligate RNA-binding partner DGCR8. It is not well understood how the Microprocessor specifically recognizes pri-miRNA substrates. Here, we show that in addition to the well-known double-stranded RNA-binding domains, DGCR8 uses a dimeric heme-binding domain to directly contact pri-miRNAs. This RNA-binding heme domain (Rhed) directs two DGCR8 dimers to bind each pri-miRNA hairpin. The two Rhed-binding sites are located at both ends of the hairpin. The Rhed and its RNA-binding surface are important for pri-miRNA processing activity. Additionally, the heme cofactor is required for formation of processing-competent DGCR8-pri-miRNA complexes. Our study reveals a unique protein-RNA interaction central to pri-miRNA recognition. We propose a unifying model in which two DGCR8 dimers clamp a pri-miRNA hairpin using their Rheds.

Abstract: Summary
The ARF and p53 tumor suppressors are thought to act in a linear pathway to prevent cellular transformation in response to various oncogenic signals. Here, we show that loss of p53 leads to an increase in ARF protein levels, which function to limit the proliferation and tumorigenicity of p53-deficient cells by inhibiting an IFN-β-STAT1-ISG15 signaling axis. Human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor samples with coinactivation of p53 and ARF exhibit high expression of both STAT1 and ISG15, and TNBC cell lines are sensitive to STAT1 depletion. We propose that loss of p53 function and subsequent ARF induction creates a selective pressure to inactivate ARF and propose that tumors harboring coinactivation of ARF and p53 would benefit from therapies targeted against STAT1 and ISG15 activation.

Abstract: Summary
In bacteria, translation-transcription coupling inhibits RNA polymerase (RNAP) stalling. We present evidence suggesting that, upon amino acid starvation, inactive ribosomes promote rather than inhibit RNAP stalling. We developed an algorithm to evaluate genome-wide polymerase progression independently of local noise and used it to reveal that the transcription factor DksA inhibits promoter-proximal pausing and increases RNAP elongation when uncoupled from translation by depletion of charged tRNAs. DksA has minimal effect on RNAP elongation in vitro and on untranslated RNAs in vivo. In these cases, transcripts can form RNA structures that prevent backtracking. Thus, the effect of DksA on transcript elongation may occur primarily upon ribosome slowing/stalling or at promoter-proximal locations that limit the potential for RNA structure. We propose that inactive ribosomes prevent formation of backtrack-blocking mRNA structures and that, in this circumstance, DksA acts as a transcription elongation factor in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome biosynthesis is a major intracellular energy-consuming process. We previously identified a nucleolar factor, nucleomethylin (NML), which regulates intracellular energy consumption by limiting rRNA transcription. Here, we show that, in livers of obese mice, the recruitment of NML to rRNA gene loci is increased to repress rRNA transcription. To clarify the relationship between obesity and rRNA transcription, we generated NML-null (NML-KO) mice. NML-KO mice show elevated rRNA level, reduced ATP concentration, and reduced lipid accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed NML-KO mice, hepatic rRNA levels are not decreased. Both weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed NML-KO mice are significantly lower than those in HFD-fed wild-type mice. These findings indicate that rRNA transcriptional activation promotes hepatic energy consumption, which alters hepatic lipid metabolism. Namely, hepatic rRNA transcriptional repression by HFD feeding is essential for energy storage.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance, have their basis in dysregulated lipid metabolism and low-grade inflammation. In a microarray search of unique lipase-related genes whose expressions are associated with obesity, we found that two secreted phospholipase A2s (sPLA2s), PLA2G5 and PLA2G2E, were robustly induced in adipocytes of obese mice. Analyses of Pla2g5–/– and Pla2g2e–/– mice revealed distinct roles of these sPLA2s in diet-induced obesity. PLA2G5 hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine in fat-overladen low-density lipoprotein to release unsaturated fatty acids, which prevented palmitate-induced M1 macrophage polarization. As such, PLA2G5 tipped the immune balance toward an M2 state, thereby counteracting adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. PLA2G2E altered minor lipoprotein phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and moderately facilitated lipid accumulation in adipose tissue and liver. Collectively, the identification of “metabolic sPLA2s” adds this gene family to a growing list of lipolytic enzymes that act as metabolic coordinators.

Abstract: A new piscean fibroblastic cell line termed as PCF derived from the caudal fin tissue of dark mahseer, Puntius (Tor) chelynoides was established and characterized in the present study which was found to be suitable for toxicity and gene expression studies as in vitro model. The cell line grew well in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were able to grow at a temperature ranging from 20 to 28°C with an optimal growth at 24°C and the cell line have been expanded in culture for more than 70 passages. Authentication of the cell line was carried out using mitochondrial DNA markers (Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I and 16S ribosomal RNA). Presence of vimentin in the cells confirmed the fibroblastic origin of cell line. Significant cytopathic effects were observed upon exposure of PCF cell line to bacterial extracellular products and the study also validated the suitability of cell line in transgenic applications as well as in genotoxicity assessment as an in vitro model.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane phospholipids typically contain fatty acids (FAs) of 16 and 18 carbon atoms. This particular chain length is evolutionarily highly conserved and presumably provides maximum stability and dynamic properties to biological membranes in response to nutritional or environmental cues. Here, we show that the relative proportion of C16 versus C18 FAs is regulated by the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of FA de novo synthesis. Acc1 activity is attenuated by AMPK/Snf1-dependent phosphorylation, which is required to maintain an appropriate acyl-chain length distribution. Moreover, we find that the transcriptional repressor Opi1 preferentially binds to C16 over C18 phosphatidic acid (PA) species: thus, C16-chain containing PA sequesters Opi1 more effectively to the ER, enabling AMPK/Snf1 control of PA acyl-chain length to determine the degree of derepression of Opi1 target genes. These findings reveal an unexpected regulatory link between the major energy-sensing kinase, membrane lipid composition, and transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) is a major integrator of the nutritional status at the crossroads of fat, sugar, and protein catabolism. Here we show that nutrient starvation causes rapid depletion of AcCoA. AcCoA depletion entailed the commensurate reduction in the overall acetylation of cytoplasmic proteins, as well as the induction of autophagy, a homeostatic process of self-digestion. Multiple distinct manipulations designed to increase or reduce cytosolic AcCoA led to the suppression or induction of autophagy, respectively, both in cultured human cells and in mice. Moreover, maintenance of high AcCoA levels inhibited maladaptive autophagy in a model of cardiac pressure overload. Depletion of AcCoA reduced the activity of the acetyltransferase EP300, and EP300 was required for the suppression of autophagy by high AcCoA levels. Altogether, our results indicate that cytosolic AcCoA functions as a central metabolic regulator of autophagy, thus delineating AcCoA-centered pharmacological strategies that allow for the therapeutic manipulation of autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) initiates IRE1α, ATF6, and PERK cascades, leading to a transcriptional/translational response known as unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we show that VEGF activates UPR mediators through a PLCγ-mediated crosstalk with the mTORC1 complex without accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Activation of ATF6 and PERK contributes to the survival effect of VEGF on endothelial cells (ECs) by positively regulating mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473, which is required for full activity of AKT. Low levels of CHOP allow ECs to evade the proapoptotic effect of this UPR product. Depletion of PLCγ, ATF6, or eIF2α dramatically inhibited VEGF-induced vascularization in mouse Matrigel plugs, suggesting that the ER and the UPR machinery constitute components of the VEGF signaling circuit that regulates EC survival and angiogenesis, extending their role beyond adaptation to ER stress.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic analysis has revealed the existence of a large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with different functions in a variety of organisms, including yeast. Cells display dramatic changes of gene expression upon environmental changes. Upon osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are induced by the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) p38/Hog1. Using whole-genome tiling arrays, we found that Hog1 induces a set of lncRNAs upon stress. One of the genes expressing a Hog1-dependent lncRNA in antisense orientation is CDC28, the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) that controls the cell cycle in yeast. Cdc28 lncRNA mediates the establishment of gene looping and the relocalization of Hog1 and RSC from the 3′ UTR to the +1 nucleosome to induce CDC28 expression. The increase in the levels of Cdc28 results in cells able to reenter the cell cycle more efficiently after stress. This may represent a general mechanism to prime expression of genes needed after stresses are alleviated.

Abstract: Summary
Carrier-facilitated pyruvate transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane plays an essential role in anabolic and catabolic intermediary metabolism. Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (Mpc2) is believed to be a component of the complex that facilitates mitochondrial pyruvate import. Complete MPC2 deficiency resulted in embryonic lethality in mice. However, a second mouse line expressing an N-terminal truncated MPC2 protein (Mpc2Δ16) was viable but exhibited a reduced capacity for mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation. Metabolic studies demonstrated exaggerated blood lactate concentrations after pyruvate, glucose, or insulin challenge in Mpc2Δ16 mice. Additionally, compared with wild-type controls, Mpc2Δ16 mice exhibited normal insulin sensitivity but elevated blood glucose after bolus pyruvate or glucose injection. This was attributable to reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and was corrected by sulfonylurea KATP channel inhibitor administration. Collectively, these data are consistent with a role for MPC2 in mitochondrial pyruvate import and suggest that Mpc2 deficiency results in defective pancreatic β cell glucose sensing.

Abstract: Summary
Neural plasticity requires protein synthesis, but the identity of newly synthesized proteins generated in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli remains unclear. We used in vivo bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) with the methionine analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) combined with the multidimensional protein identification technique (MudPIT) to identify proteins that are synthesized in the tadpole brain over 24 hr. We induced conditioning-dependent plasticity of visual avoidance behavior, which required N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Ca2+-permeable α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, αCaMKII, and rapid protein synthesis. Combining BONCAT with western blots revealed that proteins including αCaMKII, MEK1, CPEB, and GAD65 are synthesized during conditioning. Acute synthesis of CPEB during conditioning is required for behavioral plasticity as well as conditioning-induced synaptic and structural plasticity in the tectal circuit. We outline a signaling pathway that regulates protein-synthesis-dependent behavioral plasticity in intact animals, identify newly synthesized proteins induced by visual experience, and demonstrate a requirement for acute synthesis of CPEB in plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is associated with infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue (AT), contributing to insulin resistance and diabetes. However, relatively little is known regarding the origin of AT macrophages (ATMs). We discovered that murine models of obesity have prominent monocytosis and neutrophilia, associated with proliferation and expansion of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors. AT transplantation conferred myeloid progenitor proliferation in lean recipients, while weight loss in both mice and humans (via gastric bypass) was associated with a reversal of monocytosis and neutrophilia. Adipose S100A8/A9 induced ATM TLR4/MyD88 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production. IL-1β interacted with the IL-1 receptor on BM myeloid progenitors to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils. These studies uncover a positive feedback loop between ATMs and BM myeloid progenitors and suggest that inhibition of TLR4 ligands or the NLRP3-IL-1β signaling axis could reduce AT inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Actomyosin contractility plays a key role in tissue morphogenesis. During mammalian development, PTK7 regulates epithelial morphogenesis and planar cell polarity (PCP) through modulation of actomyosin contractility, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that PTK7 interacts with the tyrosine kinase Src and stimulates Src signaling along cell-cell contacts. We further identify ROCK2 as a target of junctional PTK7-Src signaling. PTK7 knockdown in cultured epithelial cells reduced the level of active Src at cell-cell contacts, resulting in delocalization of ROCK2 from cell-cell contacts and decreased junctional contractility, with a concomitant increase in actomyosin on the basal surface. Moreover, we present in vivo evidence that Src family kinase (SFK) activity is critical for PCP regulation in the auditory sensory epithelium and that PTK7-SFK signaling regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional ROCK2. Together, these results delineate a PTK7-Src signaling module for spatial regulation of ROCK activity, actomyosin contractility, and epithelial PCP.

Abstract: Summary
To decipher the molecular basis for RET kinase activation and oncogenic deregulation, we defined the temporal sequence of RET autophosphorylation by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. Early autophosphorylation sites map to regions flanking the kinase domain core, while sites within the activation loop only form at later time points. Comparison with oncogenic RET kinase revealed that late autophosphorylation sites become phosphorylated much earlier than wild-type RET, which is due to a combination of an enhanced enzymatic activity, increased ATP affinity, and surprisingly, by providing a better intermolecular substrate. Structural analysis of oncogenic M918T and wild-type RET kinase domains reveal a cis-inhibitory mechanism involving tethering contacts between the glycine-rich loop, activation loop, and αC-helix. Tether mutations only affected substrate presentation but perturbed the autophosphorylation trajectory similar to oncogenic mutations. This study reveals an unappreciated role for oncogenic RET kinase mutations in promoting intermolecular autophosphorylation by enhancing substrate presentation.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins establish and maintain genetic programs that regulate cell-fate decisions. Drosophila multi sex combs (mxc) was categorized as a PcG gene based on a classical Polycomb phenotype and genetic interactions; however, a mechanistic connection between Polycomb and Mxc has not been elucidated. Hypomorphic alleles of mxc are characterized by male and female sterility and ectopic sex combs. Mxc is an important regulator of histone synthesis, and we find that increased levels of the core histone H3 in mxc mutants result in replicative stress and a persistent DNA damage response (DDR). Germline loss, ectopic sex combs and the DDR are suppressed by reducing H3 in mxc mutants. Conversely, mxc phenotypes are enhanced when the DDR is abrogated. Importantly, replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment recapitulated mxc germline phenotypes. These data reveal how persistent replicative stress affects gene expression, tissue homeostasis, and maintenance of cellular identity in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeres are defined by the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A in a subset of centromeric nucleosomes. CENP-A deposition to centromeres depends on a specialized loading factor from yeast to humans that is called CAL1 in Drosophila. Here, we show that CAL1 directly interacts with RDX, an adaptor for CUL3-mediated ubiquitylation. However, CAL1 is not a substrate of the CUL3/RDX ligase but functions as an additional substrate-specifying factor for the CUL3/RDX-mediated ubiquitylation of CENP-A. Remarkably, ubiquitylation of CENP-A by CUL3/RDX does not trigger its degradation but stabilizes CENP-A and CAL1. Loss of RDX leads to a rapid degradation of CAL1 and CENP-A and to massive chromosome segregation defects during development. Essentially, we identified a proteolysis-independent role of ubiquitin conjugation in centromere regulation that is essential for the maintenance of the centromere-defining protein CENP-A and its loading factor CAL1.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes proteins that are important for ATP biogenesis. Therefore, changes in mtDNA copy number will have profound consequences on cell survival and proliferation. RECQ4 DNA helicase participates in both nuclear DNA and mtDNA synthesis. However, the mechanism that balances the distribution of RECQ4 in the nucleus and mitochondria is unknown. Here, we show that RECQ4 forms protein complexes with Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), nucleophosmin (NPM), and mitochondrial p32 in different cellular compartments. Critically, the interaction with p32 negatively controls the transport of both RECQ4 and its chromatin-associated replication factor, MCM10, from the nucleus to mitochondria. Amino acids that are deleted in the most common cancer-associated RECQ4 mutation are required for the interaction with p32. Hence, this RECQ4 mutant, which is no longer regulated by p32 and is enriched in the mitochondria, interacts with the mitochondrial replication helicase PEO1 and induces abnormally high levels of mtDNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic insulin resistance is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Paradoxically, the development of insulin resistance in the liver is not universal, but pathway selective, such that insulin fails to suppress gluconeogenesis but promotes lipogenesis, contributing to the hyperglycemia, steatosis, and hypertriglyceridemia that underpin the deteriorating glucose control and microvascular complications in T2D. The molecular basis for the pathway-specific insulin resistance remains unknown. Here we report that oxidative stress accompanying obesity inactivates protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the liver to activate select signaling pathways that exacerbate disease progression. In obese mice, hepatic PTPN2 (TCPTP) inactivation promoted lipogenesis and steatosis and insulin-STAT-5 signaling. The enhanced STAT-5 signaling increased hepatic IGF-1 production, which suppressed central growth hormone release and exacerbated the development of obesity and T2D. Our studies define a mechanism for the development of selective insulin resistance with wide-ranging implications for diseases characterized by oxidative stress.

Abstract: Myostatin represses muscle growth by negatively regulating the number and size of muscle fibers. Myostatin loss-of-function can result in the double-muscling phenotype and increased muscle mass. Thus, knockout of myostatin gene could improve the quality of meat from mammals. In the present study, zinc finger nucleases, a useful tool for generating gene knockout animals, were designed to target exon 1 of the myostatin gene. The designed ZFNs were introduced into porcine primary fibroblasts and early implantation embryos via electroporation and microinjection, respectively. Mutations around the ZFNs target site were detected in both primary fibroblasts and blastocysts. The proportion of mutant fibroblast cells and blastocyst was 4.81% and 5.31%, respectively. Thus, ZFNs can be used to knockout myostatin in porcine primary fibroblasts and early implantation embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated protein synthesis via changes in mRNA structures forms an important part of how prokaryotic cells adapt protein expression in response to changes in the environment. Little is known regarding how this concept has adapted to regulate mRNA translation via signaling pathways in mammalian cells. Here, we show that following phosphorylation by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase at serine 403, the C-terminal RING domain of HDMX binds the nascent p53 mRNA to promote a conformation that supports the p53 mRNA-HDM2 interaction and the induction of p53 synthesis. HDMX and its homolog HDM2 bind the same p53 internal ribosome entry sequences (IRES) structure but with different specificity and function. The results show how HDMX and HDM2 act as nonredundant IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) to bring a positive synergistic effect on p53 expression during genotoxic stress by first altering the structure of the newly synthesized p53 mRNA followed by stimulation of translation.

Abstract: Local Ca2+ transients such as puffs and sparks form the building blocks of cellular Ca2+ signaling in numerous cell types. They have traditionally been studied by linescan confocal microscopy, but advances in TIRF microscopy together with improved electron-multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras now enable rapid (>500framess−1) imaging of subcellular Ca2+ signals with high spatial resolution in two dimensions. This approach yields vastly more information (ca. 1Gbmin−1) than linescan imaging, rendering visual identification and analysis of local events imaged both laborious and subject to user bias. Here we describe a routine to rapidly automate identification and analysis of local Ca2+ events. This features an intuitive graphical user-interfaces and runs under Matlab and the open-source Python software. The underlying algorithm features spatial and temporal noise filtering to reliably detect even small events in the presence of noisy and fluctuating baselines; localizes sites of Ca2+ release with sub-pixel resolution; facilitates user review and editing of data; and outputs time-sequences of fluorescence ratio signals for identified event sites along with Excel-compatible tables listing amplitudes and kinetics of events.

Abstract: Summary
Global investigation of the 3′ extremity of mRNA (3′-terminome), despite its importance in gene regulation, has not been feasible due to technical challenges associated with homopolymeric sequences and relative paucity of mRNA. We here develop a method, TAIL-seq, to sequence the very end of mRNA molecules. TAIL-seq allows us to measure poly(A) tail length at the genomic scale. Median poly(A) length is 50–100 nt in HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells. Poly(A) length correlates with mRNA half-life, but not with translational efficiency. Surprisingly, we discover widespread uridylation and guanylation at the downstream of poly(A) tail. The U tails are generally attached to short poly(A) tails (<25 nt), while the G tails are found mainly on longer poly(A) tails (>40 nt), implicating their generic roles in mRNA stability control. TAIL-seq is a potent tool to dissect dynamic control of mRNA turnover and translational control, and to discover unforeseen features of RNA cleavage and tailing.

Abstract: Summary
The chromosome passenger complex (CPC) must relocate from anaphase chromosomes to the cell equator for successful cytokinesis. Although this landmark event requires the mitotic kinesin MKlp2, the spatiotemporal mechanistic basis remains elusive. Here, we show that phosphoregulation of MKlp2 by the mitotic kinase Cdk1/cyclin B1 coordinates proper mitotic transition with CPC relocation. We identified multiple Cdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation sites within the stalk and C-terminal tail that inhibit microtubule binding and bundling, oligomerization/clustering, and chromosome targeting of MKlp2. Specifically, inhibition of these abilities by Cdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation is essential for proper early mitotic progression. Upon anaphase onset, however, reversal of Cdk1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation promotes MKlp2-CPC complex formation and relocates the CPC from anaphase chromosomes for successful cytokinesis. Thus, we propose that phosphoregulation of MKlp2 by Cdk1/cyclin B1 ensures that activation of MKlp2 kinesin and relocation of the CPC occur at the appropriate time and space for proper mitotic progression and genomic stability.

Abstract: Summary
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can function as genetic information and may have served as genomic material before the existence of DNA-based life. By developing a method to purify dsRNA, we have investigated the diversity of dsRNA in microbial populations. We detect large dsRNAs in multiple microbial populations. Analysis of an aquatic microbial population reveals that some dsRNA sequences match metagenomic DNA, suggesting that microbes contain pools of sense-antisense transcripts. In addition, ∼30% of the dsRNA sequences are not present in the corresponding DNA pool and are strongly biased toward encoding novel proteins. Of these “dsRNA unique” sequences, only a small percentage share similarity to known viruses, a large fraction assemble into RNA virus-like contigs, and the remaining fraction has an unexplained origin. These results have uncovered dsRNA virus-like elements and underscore that dsRNA potentially represents an additional reservoir of genetic information in microbial populations.

Abstract: Summary
Loss- and gain-of-function mutations of the X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism. MeCP2 is previously known as a transcriptional repressor by binding to methylated DNA and recruiting histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Here, we report that MeCP2 regulates gene expression posttranscriptionally by suppressing nuclear microRNA processing. We found that MeCP2 binds directly to DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), a critical component of the nuclear microRNA-processing machinery, and interferes with the assembly of Drosha and DGCR8 complex. Protein targets of MeCP2-suppressed microRNAs include CREB, LIMK1, and Pumilio2, which play critical roles in neural development. Gain of function of MeCP2 strongly inhibits dendritic and spine growth, which depends on the interaction of MeCP2 and DGCR8. Thus, control of microRNA processing via direct interaction with DGCR8 represents a mechanism for MeCP2 regulation of gene expression and neural development.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) resides in compact nucleoids, where it is replicated and transcribed into long primary transcripts processed to generate rRNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs encoding 13 proteins. This situation differs from bacteria and eukaryotic nucleoli, which have dedicated rRNA transcription units. The assembly of rRNAs into mitoribosomes has received little study. We show that mitochondrial RNA processing enzymes involved in tRNA excision, ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ELAC2, as well as a subset of nascent mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) associate with nucleoids to initiate RNA processing and ribosome assembly. SILAC pulse-chase labeling experiments show that nascent MRPs recruited to the nucleoid fraction were highly labeled after the pulse in a transcription-dependent manner and decreased in labeling intensity during the chase. These results provide insight into the landscape of binding events required for mitochondrial ribosome assembly and firmly establish the mtDNA nucleoid as a control center for mitochondrial biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In bacteria, Hfq is a core RNA chaperone that catalyzes the interaction of mRNAs with regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs). To determine in vivo RNA sequence requirements for Hfq interactions, and to study riboregulation in a bacterial pathogen, Hfq was UV crosslinked to RNAs in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Hfq bound repeated trinucleotide motifs of A-R-N (A-A/G-any nucleotide) often associated with the Shine-Dalgarno translation initiation sequence in mRNAs. These motifs overlapped or were adjacent to the mRNA sequences bound by sRNAs. In consequence, sRNA-mRNA duplex formation will displace Hfq, promoting recycling. Fifty-five sRNAs were identified within bacteriophage-derived regions of the EHEC genome, including some of the most abundant Hfq-interacting sRNAs. One of these (AgvB) antagonized the function of the core genome regulatory sRNA, GcvB, by mimicking its mRNA substrate sequence. This bacteriophage-encoded “anti-sRNA” provided EHEC with a growth advantage specifically in bovine rectal mucus recovered from its primary colonization site in cattle.

Abstract: Suppression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling induces neural induction in the ectoderm of developing embryos. BMP signaling inhibits eural induction via the expression of various neural suppressors. Previous research has demonstrated that the ectopic expression of dominant negative BMP receptors (DNBR) reduces the expression of target genes down-stream of BMP and leads to neural induction. Additionally, gain-of-function experiments have shown that BMP downstream target genes such as MSX1, GATA1b and Vent are involved in the suppression of neural induction. For example, the Vent1/2 genes are involved in the suppression of Geminin and Sox3 expression in the neural ectodermal region of embryos. In this paper, we investigated whether PV.1, a BMP downstream target gene, negatively regulates the expression of FoxD5b, which plays a role in maintaining a neural progenitor population. A promoter assay and a cyclohexamide experiment demonstrated that PV.1 negatively regulates FoxD5b expression.

Abstract: Comparative immunolocalisations of latent transforming growth factor-beta-1 binding protein (LTBP)-2, fibrillin-1, versican and perlecan were undertaken in foetal human and wild type C57BL/6 mouse and Hspg2 exon 3 null HS deficient mouse intervertebral discs (IVDs). LTBP-2 was a prominent pericellular component of annular fibrochondrocytes in the posterior annulus fibrosus (AF), interstitial matrix adjacent to nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and to fibrillar and cell associated material in the anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and also displayed a pericellular localisation pattern in murine IVDs. Perlecan and LTBP-2 displayed strong pericellular colocalisation patterns in the posterior AF and to fibrillar material in the outer anterior AF in the foetal human IVD. Versican was a prominent fibril-associated component in the posterior and anterior AF, localised in close proximity to fibrillin-1 in fibrillar arrangements in the cartilaginous vertebral rudiments around paraspinal blood vessels, to major collagen fibre bundles in the anterior and posterior AF and shorter fibres in the NP. Fibrillin-1 was prominent in the outer anterior AF of the human foetal IVD and in fibres extending from the AF into the cartilaginous vertebral rudiments. LTBP-2 was prominently associated with annular fibrils containing fibrillin-1, versican was localised in close proximity to these but not specifically with LTBP-2. The similar deposition levels of LTBP-2 observed in the AF of the Hspg2 exon 3 null and wild type murine IVDs indicated that perlecan HS was not essential for LTBP-2 deposition but colocalisation of LTBP-2 with perlecan in the foetal human IVD was consistent with HS mediated interactions which have already been demonstrated in-vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is a major clinical challenge for cancer treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant epigenetic modifications contribute significantly to tumor formation and progression. However, the drivers and roles of such epigenetic changes in tumor metastasis are still poorly understood. Using bioinformatic analysis of human breast cancer gene-expression data sets, we identified histone demethylase RBP2 as a putative mediator of metastatic progression. By using both human breast cancer cells and genetically engineered mice, we demonstrated that RBP2 is critical for breast cancer metastasis to the lung in multiple in vivo models. Mechanistically, RBP2 promotes metastasis as a pleiotropic positive regulator of many metastasis genes, including TNC. In addition, RBP2 loss suppresses tumor formation in MMTV-neu transgenic mice. These results suggest that therapeutic targeting of RBP2 is a potential strategy for inhibition of tumor progression and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
We devised a high-throughput, cell-based assay to identify compounds to treat Group3 medulloblastoma (G3 MB). Mouse G3 MBs neurospheres were screened against a library of approximately 7,000 compounds including US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. We found that pemetrexed and gemcitabine preferentially inhibited G3 MB proliferation in vitro compared to control neurospheres and substantially inhibited G3 MB proliferation in vivo. When combined, these two drugs significantly increased survival of mice bearing cortical implants of mouse and human G3 MBs that overexpress MYC compared to each agent alone, while having little effect on mouse MBs of the sonic hedgehog subgroup. Our findings strongly suggest that combination therapy with pemetrexed and gemcitabine is a promising treatment for G3 MBs.

Abstract: Summary
Many human cancers are dramatically accelerated by chronic inflammation. However, the specific cellular and molecular elements mediating this effect remain largely unknown. Using a murine model of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), we found that KrasG12D induces expression of functional IL-17 receptors on PanIN epithelial cells and also stimulates infiltration of the pancreatic stroma by IL-17-producing immune cells. Both effects are augmented by associated chronic pancreatitis, resulting in functional in vivo changes in PanIN epithelial gene expression. Forced IL-17 overexpression dramatically accelerates PanIN initiation and progression, while inhibition of IL-17 signaling using genetic or pharmacologic techniques effectively prevents PanIN formation. Together, these studies suggest that a hematopoietic-to-epithelial IL-17 signaling axis is a potent and requisite driver of PanIN formation.

Abstract: Summary
A successful cellular response to virus infection is essential for evolutionary survival. In plants, arthropods, and nematodes, cellular antiviral defenses rely on RNAi. Interestingly, the mammalian response to virus is predominantly orchestrated through interferon (IFN)-mediated induction of antiviral proteins. Despite the potency of the IFN system, it remains unclear whether mammals also have the capacity to employ antiviral RNAi. Here, we investigated this by disabling IFN function, small RNA function, or both activities in the context of virus infection. We find that loss of small RNAs in the context of an in vivo RNA virus infection lowers titers due to reduced transcriptional repression of the host antiviral response. In contrast, enabling a virus with the capacity to inhibit the IFN system results in increased titers. Taken together, these results indicate that small RNA silencing is not a physiological contributor to the IFN-mediated cellular response to virus infection.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence for distinct human cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains contentious and the degree to which different cancer cells contribute to propagating malignancies in patients remains unexplored. In low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we establish the existence of rare multipotent MDS stem cells (MDS-SCs), and their hierarchical relationship to lineage-restricted MDS progenitors. All identified somatically acquired genetic lesions were backtracked to distinct MDS-SCs, establishing their distinct MDS-propagating function in vivo. In isolated del(5q)-MDS, acquisition of del(5q) preceded diverse recurrent driver mutations. Sequential analysis in del(5q)-MDS revealed genetic evolution in MDS-SCs and MDS-progenitors prior to leukemic transformation. These findings provide definitive evidence for rare human MDS-SCs in vivo, with extensive implications for the targeting of the cells required and sufficient for MDS-propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we generated a genome-scale shRNA library targeting long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in the mouse. We performed an unbiased loss-of-function study in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and identified 20 lincRNAs involved in the maintenance of pluripotency. Among these, TUNA (Tcl1 Upstream Neuron-Associated lincRNA, or megamind) was required for pluripotency and formed a complex with three RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The TUNA-RBP complex was detected at the promoters of Nanog, Sox2, and Fgf4, and knockdown of TUNA or the individual RBPs inhibited neural differentiation of mESCs. TUNA showed striking evolutionary conservation of both sequence- and CNS-restricted expression in vertebrates. Accordingly, knockdown of tuna in zebrafish caused impaired locomotor function, and TUNA expression in the brains of Huntington’s disease patients was significantly associated with disease grade. Our results suggest that the lincRNA TUNA plays a vital role in pluripotency and neural differentiation of ESCs and is associated with neurological function of adult vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrates, pluripotent pharyngeal mesoderm progenitors produce the cardiac precursors of the second heart field as well as the branchiomeric head muscles and associated stem cells. However, the mechanisms underlying the transition from multipotent progenitors to distinct muscle precursors remain obscured by the complexity of vertebrate embryos. Using Ciona intestinalis as a simple chordate model, we show that bipotent cardiopharyngeal progenitors are primed to activate both heart and pharyngeal muscle transcriptional programs, which progressively become restricted to corresponding precursors. The transcription factor COE (Collier/OLF/EBF) orchestrates the transition to pharyngeal muscle fate both by promoting an MRF-associated myogenic program in myoblasts and by maintaining an undifferentiated state in their sister cells through Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The latter are stem cell-like muscle precursors that form most of the juvenile pharyngeal muscles. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development and evolution of the chordate cardiopharyngeal mesoderm.

Rhythmic U2af26 Alternative Splicing Controls PERIOD1 Stability and the Circadian Clock in Mice,

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock drives daily rhythms in gene expression to control metabolism, behavior, and physiology; while the underlying transcriptional feedback loops are well defined, the impact of alternative splicing on circadian biology remains poorly understood. Here we describe a robust circadian and light-inducible splicing switch that changes the reading frame of the mouse mRNA encoding U2-auxiliary-factor 26 (U2AF26). This results in translation far into the 3′ UTR, generating a C terminus with homology to the Drosophila clock regulator TIMELESS. This new U2AF26 variant destabilizes PERIOD1 protein, and U2AF26-deficient mice show nearly arrhythmic PERIOD1 protein levels and broad defects in circadian mRNA expression in peripheral clocks. At the behavioral level, these mice display increased phase advance adaptation following experimental jet lag. These data suggest light-induced U2af26 alternative splicing to be a buffering mechanism that limits PERIOD1 induction, thus stabilizing the circadian clock against abnormal changes in light:dark conditions.

Global and Local Competition between Exogenously Introduced microRNAs and Endogenously Expressed microRNAs,

Abstract: It has been reported that exogenously introduced micro-RNA (exo-miRNA) competes with endogenously expressed miRNAs (endo-miRNAs) in human cells, resulting in a detectable upregulation of mRNAs with endo-miRNA target sites (TSs). However, the detailed mechanisms of the competition between exo- and endo-miRNAs remain uninvestigated. In this study, using 74 microarrays that monitored the whole-transcriptome response after introducing miRNAs or siRNAs into HeLa cells, we systematically examined the derepression of mRNAs with exo- and/or endo-miRNA TSs. We quantitatively assessed the effect of the number of endo-miRNA TSs on the degree of mRNA derepression. As a result, we observed that the number of endo-miRNA TSs was significantly associated with the degree of derepression, supporting that the derepression resulted from the competition between exo- and endo-miRNAs. However, when we examined whether the site proficiency of exo-miRNA TSs could also influence mRNA derepression, to our surprise, we discovered a strong positive correlation. Our analysis indicates that site proficiencies of both exo- and endo-miRNA TSs are important determinants for the degree of mRNA derepression, implying that the derepression of mRNAs in response to exo-miRNA is more complex than that currently perceived. Our observations may lead to a more complete understanding of the detailed mechanisms of the competition between exo- and endo-miRNAs and to a more accurate prediction of miRNA targets. Our analysis also suggests an interesting hypothesis that long 3′-UTRs may function as molecular buffer against gene expression regulation by individual miRNAs.

Destruction of Full-Length Androgen Receptor by Wild-Type SPOP, but Not Prostate-Cancer-Associated Mutants,

Abstract: Summary
The SPOP E3 ubiquitin ligase gene is frequently mutated in human prostate cancers. Here, we demonstrate that SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr-rich degron in the hinge domain of androgen receptor (AR) and induces degradation of full-length AR and inhibition of AR-mediated gene transcription and prostate cancer cell growth. AR splicing variants, most of which lack the hinge domain, escape SPOP-mediated degradation. Prostate-cancer-associated mutants of SPOP cannot bind to and promote AR destruction. Furthermore, androgens antagonize SPOP-mediated degradation of AR, whereas antiandrogens promote this process. This study identifies AR as a bona fide substrate of SPOP and elucidates a role of SPOP mutations in prostate cancer, thus implying the importance of this pathway in resistance to antiandrogen therapy of prostate cancer.

A Peptide Mimicking VGLL4 Function Acts as a YAP Antagonist Therapy against Gastric Cancer,

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway has been implicated in suppressing tissue overgrowth and tumor formation by restricting the oncogenic activity of YAP. However, transcriptional regulators that inhibit YAP activity have not been well studied. Here, we uncover clinical importance for VGLL4 in gastric cancer suppression and find that VGLL4 directly competes with YAP for binding TEADs. Importantly, VGLL4’s tandem Tondu domains are not only essential but also sufficient for its inhibitory activity toward YAP. A peptide mimicking this function of VGLL4 potently suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that disruption of YAP-TEADs interaction by a VGLL4-mimicking peptide may be a promising therapeutic strategy against YAP-driven human cancers.
