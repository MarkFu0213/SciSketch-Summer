Abstract: Ceramides (CERs), cholesterol, and free fatty acids (FFAs) are the main lipid classes in human stratum corneum (SC, outermost skin layer), but no studies report on the detailed analysis of these classes in a single platform. The primary aims of this study were to 1) develop an LC/MS method for (semi-)quantitative analysis of all main lipid classes present in human SC; and 2) use this method to study in detail the lipid profiles of human skin substitutes and compare them to human SC lipids. By applying two injections of 10μl, the developed method detects all major SC lipids using RPLC and negative ion mode APCI-MS for detection of FFAs, and NPLC using positive ion mode APCI-MS to analyze CERs and cholesterol. Validation showed this lipid platform to be robust, reproducible, sensitive, and fast. The method was successfully applied on ex vivo human SC, human SC obtained from tape strips and human skin substitutes (porcine SC and human skin equivalents). In conjunction with FFA profiles, clear differences in CER profiles were observed between these different SC sources. Human skin equivalents more closely mimic the lipid composition of human stratum corneum than porcine skin does, although noticeable differences are still present. These differences gave biologically relevant information on some of the enzymes that are probably involved in SC lipid processing. For future research, this provides an excellent method for (semi-)quantitative, ‘high-throughput’ profiling of SC lipids and can be used to advance the understanding of skin lipids and the biological processes involved.

Abstract: Coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast requires a multi-subunit Coq polypeptide complex. Deletion of any one of the COQ genes leads to respiratory deficiency and decreased levels of the Coq4, Coq6, Coq7, and Coq9 polypeptides, suggesting that their association in a high molecular mass complex is required for stability. Over-expression of the putative Coq8 kinase in certain coq null mutants restores steady-state levels of the sensitive Coq polypeptides and promotes the synthesis of late-stage Q-intermediates. Here we show that over-expression of Coq8 in yeast coq null mutants profoundly affects the association of several of the Coq polypeptides in high molecular mass complexes, as assayed by separation of digitonin extracts of mitochondria by two-dimensional blue-native/SDS PAGE. The Coq4 polypeptide persists at high molecular mass with over-expression of Coq8 in coq3, coq5, coq6, coq7, coq9, and coq10 mutants, indicating that Coq4 is a central organizer of the Coq complex. Supplementation with exogenous Q6 increased the steady-state levels of Coq4, Coq7, and Coq9, and several other mitochondrial polypeptides in select coq null mutants, and also promoted the formation of late-stage Q-intermediates. Q supplementation may stabilize this complex by interacting with one or more of the Coq polypeptides. The stabilizing effects of exogenously added Q6 or over-expression of Coq8 depend on Coq1 and Coq2 production of a polyisoprenyl intermediate. Based on the observed interdependence of the Coq polypeptides, the effect of exogenous Q6, and the requirement for an endogenously produced polyisoprenyl intermediate, we propose a new model for the Q-biosynthetic complex, termed the CoQ-synthome.

Abstract: Niemann–Pick Type C (NPC) disease is caused by a deficiency of either NPC1 or NPC2. Loss of function of either protein results in the progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in every tissue leading to cell death and organ damage. Most literature on NPC disease focuses on neurological and liver manifestations. Pulmonary dysfunction is less well described. The present studies investigated how Npc1 deficiency impacts the absolute weight, lipid composition and histology of the lungs of Npc1−/− mice (Npc1nih) at different stages of the disease, and also quantitated changes in the rates of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the lung over this same time span (8 to 70days of age). Similar measurements were made in Npc2−/− mice at 70days. All mice were of the BALB/c strain and were fed a basal rodent chow diet. Well before weaning, the lung weight, cholesterol and phospholipid (PL) content, and cholesterol synthesis rate were all elevated in the Npc1−/− mice and remained so at 70days of age. In contrast, lung triacylglycerol content was reduced while there was no change in lung fatty acid synthesis. Despite the elevated PL content, the composition of PL in the lungs of the Npc1−/− mice was unchanged. H&E staining revealed an age-related increase in the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in the alveoli of the lungs of the Npc1−/− mice starting as early as 28days. Similar metabolic and histologic changes were evident in the lungs of the Npc2−/− mice. Together these findings demonstrate an intrinsic lung pathology in NPC disease that is of early onset and worsens over time.

Abstract: The endothelial lining and its outer lipid membrane are the first major barriers drug molecules encounter upon intravenous administration. Our previous work identified lipid analogs that counteract plasma membrane barrier function for a series of amphiphilic drugs. For example, short-chain sphingolipids (SCS), like N-octanoyl-glucosylceramide, effectively elevated doxorubicin accumulation in tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and in endothelial cells, whereas other (normal) cells remained unaffected. We hypothesize here that local membrane lipid composition and the degree of lipid ordering define SCS efficacy in individual cells. To this end, we study the differential effect of SCS on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in its confluent versus proliferative state, as a model system. While their (plasma membrane) lipidome stays remarkably unaltered when BAECs reach confluency, their lipids segregate to form apical and basolateral domains. Using probe NR12S, we reveal that lipids in the apical membrane are more condensed/liquid-ordered. SCS preferentially attenuate the barrier posed by these condensed membranes and facilitate doxorubicin influx in these particular membrane regions. We confirm these findings in MDCK cells and artificial membranes. In conclusion, SCS-facilitated drug traversal acts on condensed membrane domains, elicited by confluency in resting endothelium.

Abstract: Enzymes of the CYP74 family, including the divinyl ether synthase (DES), play important roles in plant cell signalling and defence. The potent DES activities have been detected before in the leaves of the meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris L.) and few other Ranunculaceae species. The nature of these DESs and their genes remained unrevealed. The PCR with degenerate primers enabled to detect the transcript of unknown P450 gene assigned as CYP74Q1. Besides, two more CYP74Q1 isoforms with minimal sequence variations have been found. The full length recombinant CYP74Q1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The preferred substrates of this enzyme are the 13-hydroperoxides of α-linolenic and linoleic acids, which are converted to the divinyl ether oxylipins (ω5Z)-etherolenic acid, (9Z,11E)-12-[(1′Z,3′Z)-hexadienyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, and (ω5Z)-etheroleic acid, (9Z,11E)-12-[(1′Z)-hexenyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, respectively, as revealed by the data of mass spectrometry, NMR and UV spectroscopy. Thus, CYP74Q1 protein was identified as the R. acris DES (RaDES), a novel DES type and the opening member of new CYP74Q subfamily.

Abstract: Cadmium is known to harm rat testis by causing the dose-dependent apoptotic or necrotic death of seminiferous epithelium cells. Here we investigated how this affects the lipids with long-chain (C18–C22) and very-long-chain (C24–C32) polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) typical of spermatogenic and Sertoli cells. A severe acute inflammatory reaction resulted from the massive necrotic death of these cells two days after a single high (4mg/kg) dose of CdCl2. This led to the conversion of most testicular glycerophospholipids to diradylglycerols (DRG) and free fatty acids (FFA) and of most sphingomyelins to ceramides (Cer). By day 30 the testis weight had decreased three-fold. The DRG and FFA had been metabolized but, unexpectedly, ceramides persisted. Also slow to disappear were VLCPUFA-containing triacylglycerols from former germ cells and ether-linked triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (CE) from former Sertoli cells. Similar results were observed 30 and 45days after administering repeated small non pro-inflammatory CdCl2 doses (1mg/kg). At day 30 after both treatments, an amorphous material replaced the original seminiferous tubules and the interstitium was populated by macrophages. Species of CE and ether-linked triglycerides containing fatty acids other than VLCPUFA steadily accumulated in the irreversibly damaged testis, a manifestation of the activity of these cells. The long-term permanence of original VLCPUFA-containing neutral lipids, especially ceramides, indicates that these phagocytes were slow to clear out the acellular material contained in seminiferous tubules, pointing to a form of silent chronic inflammation as an additional outcome of the multifactorial commotion caused in the testis by experimentally administered cadmium.

Abstract: A hallmark of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the accumulation of lipids. We developed a mathematical model of the hepatic lipid dynamics to simulate the fate of fatty acids in hepatocytes. Our model involves fatty acid uptake, lipid oxidation, and lipid export. It takes into account that storage of triacylglycerol within hepatocytes leads to cell enlargement reducing the sinusoids radius and impairing hepatic microcirculation. Thus oxygen supply is reduced, which impairs lipid oxidation. The analysis of our model revealed a bistable behavior (two stable steady states) of the system, in agreement with histological observations showing distinct areas of lipid accumulation in lobules. The first (healthy) state is characterized by intact lipid oxidation and a low amount of stored lipids. The second state in our model may correspond to the steatotic cell; it is marked by a high amount of stored lipids and a reduced lipid oxidation caused by impaired oxygen supply. Our model stresses the role of insufficient oxygen supply for the development of steatosis. We discuss implications of our results in regard to the experimental design aimed at exploring lipid metabolism reactions under steatotic conditions. Moreover, the model helps to understand the reversibility of lipid accumulation and predicts the reversible switch to show hysteresis. The system can switch from the steatotic state back to the healthy state by reduction of fatty acid uptake below the threshold at which steatosis started. The reversibility corresponds to the observation that caloric restriction can reduce the lipid content in the liver.

Abstract: Lipid rafts, plasma membrane microdomains, are important for cell survival signaling and cholesterol is a critical lipid component for lipid raft integrity and function. DHA is known to have poor affinity for cholesterol and it influences lipid rafts. Here, we investigated a mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of DHA using a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. We found that DHA decreased cell surface levels of lipid rafts via their internalization, which was partially reversed by cholesterol addition. With DHA treatment, caveolin-1, a marker for rafts, and EGFR were colocalized with LAMP-1, a lysosomal marker, in a cholesterol-dependent manner, indicating that DHA induces raft fusion with lysosomes. DHA not only displaced several raft-associated onco-proteins, including EGFR, Hsp90, Akt, and Src, from the rafts but also decreased total levels of those proteins via multiple pathways, including the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways, thereby decreasing their activities. Hsp90 overexpression maintained its client proteins, EGFR and Akt, and attenuated DHA-induced cell death. In addition, overexpression of Akt or constitutively active Akt attenuated DHA-induced apoptosis. All these data indicate that the anti-proliferative effect of DHA is mediated by targeting of lipid rafts via decreasing cell surface lipid rafts by their internalization, thereby decreasing raft-associated onco-proteins via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways and decreasing Hsp90 chaperone function.

Abstract: Reprogramming energy metabolism constitutes one of the hallmarks of cancer. Changes in lipid composition of cell membranes also appear early in carcinogenesis. Quantification of various molecules such as lipids evidences the modifications in the metabolism of tumour cells and can serve as potential markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool used for the detection and characterization of various types of molecules. This technique remains an attractive approach as it is cheap (equipment and reagents), does not require high grade solvents or expensive internal standards, equipment is widely available in standard laboratories and the method is robust and suitable for routine analyses. In this work we established partial least square (PLS) models based on FTIR spectra able to quantify lipids in complex mixtures such as cell extracts. In the first part, we attempted to build PLS models with FTIR spectra of 53 mixtures of 8 well-characterized pure lipids. Second, the PLS models were verified using FTIR spectra of mixtures that did not contribute to the calibration. The third step was the validation of the models on lipid cell extracts. In order to obtain reference values for cell extracts, high performance liquid chromatography was carried out by AVANTI. The lipid distribution were globally similar with both techniques, PLS models and chromatography. Finally, the models were applied to determine the lipid composition of cells exposed to four treatments. We could not evidence significant changes in the lipid composition of cell extracts after treatment, in terms of polar head groups. However, the models established in this study appear reliable and could be applied for high throughput measurements. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Tools to study lipid functions.

Abstract: The acute-phase human protein serum amyloid A (SAA) is enriched in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with inflammatory diseases. Compared with normal HDL containing apolipoprotein A-I, which is the principal protein component, characteristics of acute-phase HDL containing SAA remain largely undefined. In the present study, we examined the physicochemical properties of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles formed by lipid interactions with SAA. Fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements revealed that although SAA was unstructured at physiological temperature, α-helix formation was induced upon binding to phospholipid vesicles. SAA also formed rHDL particles by solubilizing phospholipid vesicles through mechanisms that are common to other exchangeable apolipoproteins. Dynamic light scattering and nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses of rHDL after gel filtration revealed particle sizes of approximately 10nm, and a discoidal shape was verified by transmission electron microscopy. Thermal denaturation experiments indicated that SAA molecules in rHDL retained α-helical conformations at 37°C, but were almost completely denatured around 60°C. Furthermore, trypsin digestion experiments showed that lipid binding rendered SAA molecules resistant to protein degradation. In humans, three major SAA1 isoforms (SAA1.1, 1.3, and 1.5) are known. Although these isoforms have different amino acids at residues 52 and 57, no major differences in physicochemical properties between rHDL particles resulting from lipid interactions with SAA isoforms have been found. The present data provide useful insights into the effects of SAA enrichment on the physicochemical properties of HDL.

Abstract: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induce hepatocyte cell death, wherein oxidative stress is mechanistically involved. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional regulator of cellular antioxidant defense enzymes. Therefore, Nrf2 activation is regarded as an effective strategy against oxidative stress-triggered cellular damage. In this study, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used Nrf2 activator, was initially employed to investigate the potential protective role of Nrf2 activation in SFA-induced hepatoxicity. As expected, SFA-induced hepatocyte cell death was prevented by tBHQ in both AML-12 mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. However, the protective effect of tBHQ is Nrf2-independent, because the siRNA-mediated Nrf2 silencing did not abrogate tBHQ-conferred protection. Alternatively, our results revealed that autophagy activation was critically involved in the protective effect of tBHQ on lipotoxicity. tBHQ induced autophagy activation and autophagy inhibitors abolished tBHQ's protection. The induction of autophagy by tBHQ exposure was demonstrated by the increased accumulation of LC3 puncta, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic flux (LC3-II conversion in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors). Subsequent mechanistic investigation discovered that tBHQ exposure activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and siRNA-mediated AMPK gene silencing abolished tBHQ-induced autophagy activation, indicating that AMPK is critically involved in tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction. Furthermore, our study provided evidence that tBHQ-induced autophagy activation is required for its Nrf2-activating property. Collectively, our data uncover a novel mechanism for tBHQ in protecting hepatocytes against SFA-induced lipotoxicity. tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction contributes not only to its hepatoprotective effect, but also to its Nrf2-activating property.

Abstract: There is a paucity of information about phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in bone formation. Thus, we characterized PC metabolism in both primary human osteoblasts (HOB) and human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. Our results show that the CDP-choline pathway is the only de novo route for PC biosynthesis in both HOB and MG-63 cells. Both CK activity and CKα expression in MG-63 cells were significantly higher than those in HOB cells. Silencing of CKα in MG-63 cells had no significant effect on PC concentration but decreased the amount of phosphocholine by approximately 80%. The silencing of CKα also reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of CK activity impaired the mineralization capacity of MG-63 cells. Our data suggest that CK and its product phosphocholine are required for the normal growth and mineralization of MG-63 cells.

Abstract: Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) contributes to cell growth, but the contribution of sEH to embryonic development is not well understood. In this study, Xenopus sEH cDNA was isolated from embryos of Xenopus laevis. The Xenopus sEH was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified. The epoxide hydrolase and phosphatase activities of purified sEH were investigated. The Xenopus sEH did not show phosphatase activity toward 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate or several lysophosphatidic acids although it had EH activity. The amino acid sequence of Xenopus sEH was compared with that reported previously. We found amino acid substitutions of the 29th Thr to Asn and the 146th Arg to His and prepared a sEH mutant (N29T/H146R), designed as mutant 1. Neither wild-type sEH nor mutant 1 had phosphatase activity. Additional substitution of the 11th Gly with Asp was found by comparison with human sEH which has phosphatase activity, but the Xenopus sEH mutant G11D prepared as mutant 2 did not have phosphatase activity. The epoxide hydrolase activity of sEH seemed to be similar to that of human sEH, while Xenopus sEH did not have phosphatase activity toward several substrates that human sEH metabolizes.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein-derived peptides are promising candidates for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. The beneficial effects of these peptides are based on multiple mechanisms; prominent among them being high-affinity binding to pro-inflammatory oxidized phospholipids (Ox-PLs) and facilitating their sequestration/metabolism/clearance in the body. This indicates that peptides which can bind exclusively to Ox-PLs without recognizing normal, non-oxidized phospholipids (non-Ox-PLs) will be more potent anti-inflammatory agent than that of the peptides that bind to both Ox-PLs and non-Ox-PLs. In order to develop such Ox-PL-specific peptides, the knowledge about the properties (molecular determinants) of peptides that govern their Ox-PL preference is a must. In this study we have synthesized eleven peptides corresponding to the conserved regions of human apolipoprotein E and compared their biochemical properties, lipid-binding specificities, and anti-inflammatory properties. Our results show that these peptides exhibit considerably different specificities towards non-Ox-PL and different species of Ox-PLs. Some of these peptides bind exclusively to the Ox-PLs and inhibit the pro-inflammatory function of Ox-PLs in human blood. Biochemical characterization revealed that the peptides possess substantially different properties. Our results suggest that physicochemical properties of peptides play an important role in their lipid-binding specificity.

Abstract: Fructose ingestion is associated with the production of hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. For fructose to attain these effects in rats, simultaneous induction of fatty acid synthesis and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is required. We aimed to determine the mechanism involved in the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by fructose and whether this effect occurs also in human liver cells. Female rats were supplemented or not with liquid fructose (10% w/v) for 7 or 14days; rat (FaO) and human (HepG2) hepatoma cells, and human hepatocytes were incubated with fructose 25mM for 24h. The expression and activity of the enzymes and transcription factors relating to fatty acid β-oxidation were evaluated. Fructose inhibited the activity of fatty acid β-oxidation only in livers of 14-day fructose-supplemented rats, as well as the expression and activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα). Similar results were observed in FaO and HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes. PPARα downregulation was not due to an osmotic effect or to an increase in protein-phosphatase 2A activity caused by fructose. Rather, it was related to increased content in liver of inactive and acetylated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α, due to a reduction in sirtuin 1 expression and activity. In conclusion, fructose inhibits liver fatty acid oxidation by reducing PPARα expression and activity, both in rat and human liver cells, by a mechanism involving sirtuin 1 down-regulation.

Abstract: Accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the fetal brain is accomplished predominantly via a highly selective flow of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, AA) through the placenta. Little is known regarding the endogenous capability of the fetus to generate its own DHA and AA from lower homologues such as linolenic (18:3n-3, ALA) and linoleic (18:2n-6, LA) acids, respectively. Deuterium-labeled d5-ALA and d5-LA at millimolar concentrations were injected directly into the amniotic fluid in order to investigate maternal-independent metabolic conversion of the stable isotopes in brain and liver of the fetus near delivery. After 48h under adequate maternal diet, the levels of d5-ALA metabolites in the fetal brain and fetal liver were 45±2.2 pmol/mg and 86±4 pmol/mg of which 79% and 63.6% were comprised of d5-DHA. At this time point, incorporation of d5-LA metabolites was 103±5 pmol/mg and 772±46 pmol/mg for brain and liver, of which 50% and 30% were comprised of d5-AA. Following sustained maternal dietary ALA deficiency, the levels of total d5-ALA derived metabolites in the fetal brain and fetal liver were increased to 231 pmol/mg and 696 pmol/mg of which 71% and 26% were comprised of d5-DHA. From the time course and relative rates of d5-ALA precursor displacement by d5-DHA in cellular phosphoglycerides, it is concluded that the fetal rat brain can generate its own DHA from its d5-ALA precursors particularly under dietary stress.

Abstract: Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is pivotal in the return of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion in bile and eventually feces. RCT from macrophages is a critical anti-atherogenicity mechanism of HDL. As the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe promoted RCT in mice, which lack cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), we investigated its effects in hamsters, which have CETP. A high-cholesterol diet (HC) increased cholesterol levels throughout lipoprotein fractions and ezetimibe markedly reduced VLDL/LDL cholesterol levels under both normal chow (NC) and HC. However, ezetimibe did not affect and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels under NC and HC, respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of 3H-cholesterol pre-labeled macrophages in an in vivo RCT assay increased tracer accumulation in the liver but reduced it in bile under HC, and these changes were completely cancelled by ezetimibe. Under both NC and HC, ezetimibe reduced tracer levels in the liver but increased them in feces, indicating promotion of RCT in vivo. We performed a RCT assay using hamsters subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) to clarify whether a transintestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) pathway contributes to ezetimibe's enhancement of RCT. BDL markedly inhibited macrophage-derived 3H-cholesterol excretion to feces and cancelled ezetimibe's stimulatory effect on RCT, suggesting that biliary cholesterol excretion is a major contributor in RCT promotion by ezetimibe but the contribution of the TICE pathway is minimal. In conclusions, ezetimibe exerts an additive anti-atherogenic property by enhancing RCT in hamsters. Our findings suggest that this property is independent of the TICE pathway.

Abstract: Phospholipids also play a major role in maintaining the lipid droplet (LD) morphology. In our current study, deletion of LPL1 resulted in altered morphology of LDs and was confirmed by microscopic analysis. LPL1/YOR059c contains lipase specific motif GXSXG and acetate labeling in the LPL1 overexpressed strains depicted a decrease in glycerophospholipids and an increase in free fatty acids. The purified Lpl1p showed phospholipase activity with broader substrate specificity, acting on all glycerophospholipids primarily at sn-2 position and later at sn-1 position. Localization studies precisely revealed that Lpl1 is exclusively localized in the LD at the stationary phase. Site directed mutagenesis experiments clearly demonstrated that the lipase motif is vital for the phospholipase activity. In summary, our results demonstrate that yeast Lpl1 exerts phospholipase activity, plays a vital role in LD morphology, and its absence results in altered LD size. Based on the localization and enzyme activity we renamed YOR059c as LPL1 (LD phospholipase 1).

Abstract: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibiting drug rapamycin (Sirolimus) has severe side effects in patients including hyperlipidemia, an established risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recently, it was shown that rapamycin decreases hepatic LDL receptor (LDL-R) expression, which likely contributes to hypercholesterolemia. Scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI) is the major HDL receptor and consequently regulating HDL-cholesterol levels and the athero-protective effects of HDL. By using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, we show that SR-BI is down-regulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This reduction of SR-BI protein as well as mRNA levels by about 50% did not alter HDL particle uptake or HDL-derived lipid transfer. However, rapamycin reduced HDL-induced activation of eNOS and stimulation of endothelial cell migration. The effects on cell migration could be counteracted by SR-BI overexpression, indicating that decreased SR-BI expression is in part responsible for the rapamycin-induced effects. We demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR leads to endothelial cell dysfunction and decreased SR-BI expression, which may contribute to atherogenesis during rapamycin treatment.

Abstract: Phospholipid remodeling involves phospholipase activity to remove acyl chains and acyltransferases to replace acyl chains. We here describe the characterization of a lysophospholipid acyltransferase in the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Expression of this gene, C.a. LPT1, complemented the lysophospholipid acyltransferase defect in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking the homologous LPT1 gene. In vitro, lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity in these strains showed acyl-CoA substrate specificity, as measured by apparent Vmax/Km ratios, to be linolenoyl-CoA>oleoyl-CoA>linoleoyl-CoA>stearoyl-CoA. To address the physiological importance of C.a. LPT1, homozygous deletion strains were generated. Lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity with amine containing lysophospholipids was dramatically reduced while lysophosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidic acid esterification was not significantly lowered. However, C.a. LPT1 over-expression yielded an increased amount of lysophosphatidic acyltransferase activity, suggesting a role in de novo phospholipid synthesis. LPT1 deletion strains showed slightly slowed growth in standard liquid media but no phenotype in media containing three antifungals that target sterols. To assess the role of C.a. Lpt1 in phospholipid remodeling, an in vivo, pulse–chase assay utilizing polysorbitan palmitate and mass spectrometry was developed. Cellular phospholipid composition became atypical with the provision of palmitate and gradually returned to the typical distribution when palmitate was removed. Deletion of C.a. LPT1 showed a modest yet significant effect on remodeling under these conditions.

Abstract: Objective
The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) plays a critical role in the formation of hepatic very low density lipoprotein. Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare, naturally occurring extreme form of MTTP inhibition, which is characterized by the virtual absence of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins in blood. The goal of this study was to examine the effect that four novel MTTP missense mutations had on protein interactions, expression and lipid-transfer activity, and to determine which mutations were responsible for the ABL phenotype observed in two patients.
Approach and results
In two patients with ABL, we identified in MTTP a novel frameshift mutation (K35Ffs*37), and four novel missense mutations, namely, G264R, Y528H, R540C, and N649S. When transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, all missense MTTP mutations interacted with apoB17, apoB48, and protein disulfide isomerase. Mutations Y528H and R540C, however, displayed negligible levels of MTTP activity and N649S displayed a partial reduction relative to the wild-type MTTP. In contrast, G264R retained full lipid-transfer activity.
Conclusions
These studies indicate that missense mutations Y528H, R540C, and N649S appear to cause ABL by reducing MTTP activity rather than by reducing binding of MTTP with protein disulfide isomerase or apoB. The region of MTTP containing amino acids 528 and 540 constitutes a critical domain for its lipid-transfer activity.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), comprised of an interconnected membrane network, is a site of phospholipid and protein synthesis. The diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) enzyme family catalyzes phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. Both of these lipids are known not only to serve as second messengers but also to represent intermediate precursors of lipids of various kinds. The DGK family is targeted to distinct subcellular sites in cDNA-transfected and native cells. Of DGKs, DGKε localizes primarily to the ER, suggesting that this isozyme plays a role in this organelle. Using experiments with various deletion and substitution mutants, this study examined the molecular mechanism of how DGKε is targeted to the ER. Results demonstrate that the N-terminal hydrophobic sequence 20–40 plays a necessary role in targeting of DGKε to the ER. This hydrophobic amino acid segment is predicted to adopt an α-helix structure, in which Leu22, L25, and L29 are present in mutual proximity, forming a hydrophobic patch. When these hydrophobic Leu residues were replaced with hydrophilic amino acid Gln, the mutant fragment designated DGKε (20–40/L22Q,L25Q,L29Q) exhibits diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm. Moreover, full-length DGKε containing these substitutions, DGKε (L22Q,L25Q,L29Q), is shown to distribute diffusely in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the N-terminal hydrophobic residues play a key role in DGKε targeting to the ER membrane. Functionally, knockdown or deletion of DGKε affects the unfolding protein response pathways, thereby rendering the cells susceptible to apoptosis, to some degree, under ER stress conditions.

Abstract: Peroxisomes play a major role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including fatty acid β-oxidation. Free fatty acids (FFAs) can enter peroxisomes through passive diffusion or by means of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including HsABCD1 (ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein), HsABCD2 (ALDRP) and HsABCD3 (PMP70). The physiological functions of the different peroxisomal half-ABCD transporters have not been fully determined yet, but there are clear indications that both HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 are required for the breakdown of fatty acids in peroxisomes. Here we report that the phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2Δ yeast mutant, i.e. impaired oxidation of oleic acid, cannot only be partially rescued by HsABCD1, HsABCD2, but also by HsABCD3, which indicates that each peroxisomal half-transporter can function as homodimer. Fatty acid oxidation measurements using various fatty acids revealed that although the substrate specificities of HsABCD1, HsABCD2 and HsABCD3 are overlapping, they have distinctive preferences. Indeed, most hydrophobic C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids are preferentially transported by HsABCD1, C22:0 and C22:6 by HsABCD2 and most hydrophilic substrates like long-chain unsaturated-, long branched-chain- and long-chain dicarboxylic fatty acids by HsABCD3. All these fatty acids are most likely transported as CoA esters. We postulate a role for human ABCD3 in the oxidation of dicarboxylic acids and a role in buffering fatty acids that are overflowing from the mitochondrial β-oxidation system.

Abstract: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids resulting from a β-oxidation defect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are also key components of the pathogenesis. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which encodes for a peroxisomal half ABC transporter predicted to participate in the entry of VLCFA-CoA into the peroxisome, the unique site of their β-oxidation. Two homologous peroxisomal ABC transporters, ABCD2 and ABCD3 have been proven to compensate for ABCD1 deficiency when overexpressed. Pharmacological induction of these target genes could therefore represent an alternative therapy for X-ALD patients. Since LXR activation was shown to repress ABCD2 expression, we investigated the effects of LXR antagonists in different cell lines. Cells were treated with GSK(17) (a LXR antagonist recently discovered from the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection), 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol (22S-HC, another LXR antagonist) and 22R-HC (an endogenous LXR agonist). We observed up-regulation of ABCD2, ABCD3 and CTNNB1 (the gene encoding for β-catenin, which was recently demonstrated to induce ABCD2 expression) in human HepG2 hepatoma cells and in X-ALD skin fibroblasts treated with LXR antagonists. Interestingly, induction in X-ALD fibroblasts was concomitant with a decrease in oxidative stress. Rats treated with 22S-HC showed hepatic induction of the 3 genes of interest. In human, we show by multiple tissue expression array that expression of ABCD2 appears to be inversely correlated with NR1H3 (LXRα) expression. Altogether, antagonists of LXR that are currently developed in the context of dyslipidemia may find another indication with X-ALD.

Abstract: Glycerophospholipids are known to be hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen into free fatty acids and lysophospholipids that are then absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells. A monolayer of enterocyte-differentiated Caco-2 cell is often used to assess the intestinal bioavailability of nutrients. In this study, we examined how differentiated Caco-2 cells process lysoglycerolipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Our findings were twofold. (1) Caco-2 cells secreted both a lysophospholipase A-like enzyme and a glycerophosphocholine-phosphodiesterase enzyme into the apical, but not basolateral, lumen, suggesting that food-derived LPC is converted to a free fatty acid, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, and choline through two sequential enzymatic reactions in humans. The release of the latter enzyme was differentiation-dependent. (2) Fatty acid-releasing activities toward exogenous fluorescent LPC, lysophosphatidic acid and monoacylglycerol were shown to be higher on the apical membranes of Caco-2 cells than on the basolateral membranes. These results suggest that human intestinal epithelial cells metabolize lysoglycerolipids by two distinct mechanisms involving secreted or apical-selective expression of metabolic enzymes.

Abstract: Diacylglycerol kinase theta (DGKθ) plays a pivotal role in regulating adrenocortical steroidogenesis by synthesizing the ligand for the nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1). In response to activation of the cAMP signaling cascade nuclear DGK activity is rapidly increased, facilitating PA-mediated, SF1-dependent transcription of genes required for cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) biosynthesis. Based on our previous work identifying DGKθ as the enzyme that produces the agonist for SF1, we generated a tetracycline-inducible H295R stable cell line to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against DGKθ and characterized the effect of silencing DGKθ on adrenocortical gene expression. Genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that silencing DGKθ expression alters the expression of multiple genes, including steroidogenic genes, nuclear receptors and genes involved in sphingolipid, phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism. Interestingly, the expression of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) was also suppressed. Consistent with the suppression of SREBPs, we observed a down-regulation of multiple SREBP target genes, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA red) and CYP51, concomitant with a decrease in cellular cholesterol. DGKθ knockdown cells exhibited a reduced capacity to metabolize PA, with a down-regulation of lipin and phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms. In contrast, suppression of DGKθ increased the expression of several genes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, including acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and sphingosine kinases (SPHK). In summary, these data demonstrate that DGKθ plays an important role in steroid hormone production in human adrenocortical cells.

Abstract: Obesity is a public health problem that contributes to the development of insulin resistance, which is associated with an excessive accumulation of lipids in skeletal muscle tissue. There is evidence that soy protein can decrease the ectopic accumulation of lipids and improves insulin sensitivity; however, it is unknown whether soy isoflavones, particularly genistein, can stimulate fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle. Thus, we studied the mechanism by which genistein stimulates fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle. We showed that genistein induced the expression of genes of fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle of Zucker fa/fa rats and in leptin receptor (ObR)-silenced C2C12 myotubes through AMPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the genistein-mediated AMPK phosphorylation occurred via JAK2, which was possibly activated through a mechanism that involved cAMP. Additionally, the genistein-mediated induction of fatty acid oxidation genes involved PGC1α and PPARδ. As a result, we observed that genistein increased fatty acid oxidation in both the control and silenced C2C12 myotubes, as well as a decrease in the RER in mice, suggesting that genistein can be used in strategies to decrease lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle.

Abstract: α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) can bind oleic acid (OA) to form HAMLET-like complexes, which exhibited highly selective anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Considering the structural similarity to α-LA, we conjectured that lactoferrin (LF) could also bind OA to obtain a complex with anti-tumor activity. In this study, LF–OA was prepared and its activity and structural changes were compared with α-LA–OA. The anti-tumor activity was evaluated by methylene blue assay, while the apoptosis mechanism was analyzed using flow cytometry and Western blot. Structural changes of LF–OA were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The interactions of OA with LF and α-LA were evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). LF–OA was obtained by heat-treatment at pH8.0 with LD50 of 4.88, 4.95 and 4.62μM for HepG2, HT29, and MCF-7 cells, respectively, all of which were 10 times higher than those of α-LA–OA. Similar to HAMLET, LF–OA induced apoptosis in tumor cells through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated pathways. Exposure of tryptophan residues and the hydrophobic regions as well as the loss of tertiary structure were observed in LF–OA. Besides these similarities, LF showed different secondary structure changes when compared with α-LA, with a decrease of α-helix and β-turn and an increase of β-sheet and random coil. ITC results showed that there was a higher binding number of OA to LF than to α-LA, while both of the proteins interacted with OA through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. This study provides a theoretical basis for further exploration of protein–OA complexes.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) accompanies obesity and insulin resistance. Recent meta-analysis suggested omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA to decrease liver fat in NAFLD patients. Anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and insulin-sensitizing effects of DHA/EPA depend on their lipid form, with marine phospholipids showing better efficacy than fish oils. We characterized the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of DHA/EPA phospholipids, alone or combined with an antidiabetic drug, on hepatosteatosis. C57BL/6N mice were fed for 7weeks an obesogenic high-fat diet (cHF) or cHF-based interventions: (i) cHF supplemented with phosphatidylcholine-rich concentrate from herring (replacing 10% of dietary lipids; PC), (ii) cHF containing rosiglitazone (10mg/kg diet; R), or (iii) PC+R. Metabolic analyses, hepatic gene expression and lipidome profiling were performed. Results showed that PC and PC+R prevented cHF-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance, while all interventions reduced abdominal fat and plasma triacylglycerols. PC and PC+R also lowered hepatic and plasma cholesterol and reduced hepatosteatosis. Microarray analysis revealed integrated down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways by PC, while R-induced lipogenesis was fully counteracted in PC+R. Gene expression changes in PC and PC+R were associated with preferential enrichment of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions by DHA/EPA. The complex down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes and the antisteatotic effects were unique to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids, since they were absent in mice fed soy-derived phosphatidylcholine. Thus, inhibition of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis associated with potent antisteatotic effects in the liver in response to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids support their use in NAFLD prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) are key transcription factors in cholesterol metabolism that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux and bile acid metabolism/excretion in the liver and numerous organs. In macrophages, LXR signaling modulates cholesterol handling and the inflammatory response, pathways involved in atherosclerosis. Since regulatory pathways of LXR transcription control are well understood, in the present study we aimed at identifying post-transcriptional regulators of LXR activity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are such post-transcriptional regulators of genes that in the canonical pathway mediate mRNA inactivation. In silico analysis identified miR-206 as a putative regulator of LXRα but not LXRβ. Indeed, as recently shown, we found that miR-206 represses LXRα activity and expression of LXRα and its target genes in hepatic cells. Interestingly, miR-206 regulates LXRα differently in macrophages. Stably overexpressing miR-206 in THP-1 human macrophages revealed an up-regulation and miR-206 knockdown led to a down-regulation of LXRα and its target genes. In support of these results, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from miR-206 KO mice also exhibited lower expression of LXRα target genes. The physiological relevance of these findings was proven by gain- and loss-of-function of miR-206; overexpression of miR-206 enhanced cholesterol efflux in human macrophages and knocking out miR-206 decreased cholesterol efflux from MPMs. Moreover, we show that miR-206 expression in macrophages is repressed by LXRα activation, while oxidized LDL and inflammatory stimuli profoundly induced miR-206 expression. We therefore propose a feed-back loop between miR-206 and LXRα that might be part of an LXR auto-regulatory mechanism to fine tune LXR activity.

miR-17 is involved in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates: Effects on liver expression of a fatty acyl desaturase in the marine teleost Siganus canaliculatus,

Abstract: Biosynthesis in vertebrates of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) such as arachidonic (ARA; 20:4n−6), eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n−3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22:6n−3) acids requires the catalysis by fatty acyl desaturases (Fads). A vertebrate Fad with Δ4 activity catalyzing the direct conversion of 22:5n−3 to DHA was discovered in the marine teleost rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. Recent studies in vertebrates have shown that miRNAs may participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism at post-transcription level. However, their roles in LC-PUFA biosynthesis were not known. In the present study, in silico analysis predicts that the rabbitfish Δ4 Fad may be a target of miR-17 and thus we cloned miR-17, which is located at the forepart of the miR-17–92 cluster. Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-17 targeted the 3′UTR of Δ4 Fad directly. Furthermore, the expression level of miR-17 displayed an inverse pattern with that of Δ4 Fad mRNA in gill, liver and eyes, and also the Δ4 Fad protein quantity in rabbitfish liver. Incubation of rabbitfish primary hepatocytes with linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n−6), α-linolenic acid (LNA; 18:3n−3), EPA or DHA showed differential effects on miR-17, Δ4 Fad and Δ6/Δ5 Fad expression. LNA promoted the expression of miR-17 and Δ6/Δ5 Fad, but suppressed the expression of Δ4 Fad. In contrast, LA and EPA decreased the expression of miR-17 and Δ6/Δ5 Fad, but had no effect on Δ4 Fad. However, all the above were down-regulated by DHA. These data indicate that miR-17 was involved in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish liver by targeting Δ4 Fad.

Adipose triglyceride lipase activity is inhibited by long-chain acyl-coenzyme A,

Abstract: Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is required for efficient mobilization of triglyceride (TG) stores in adipose tissue and non-adipose tissues. Therefore, ATGL strongly determines the availability of fatty acids for metabolic reactions. ATGL activity is regulated by a complex network of lipolytic and anti-lipolytic hormones. These signals control enzyme expression and the interaction of ATGL with the regulatory proteins CGI-58 and G0S2. Up to date, it was unknown whether ATGL activity is also controlled by lipid intermediates generated during lipolysis. Here we show that ATGL activity is inhibited by long-chain acyl-CoAs in a non-competitive manner, similar as previously shown for hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the rate-limiting enzyme for diglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue. ATGL activity is only marginally inhibited by medium-chain acyl-CoAs, diglycerides, monoglycerides, and free fatty acids. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that acyl-CoAs do not disrupt the protein–protein interaction of ATGL and its co-activator CGI-58. Furthermore, inhibition of ATGL is independent of the presence of CGI-58 and occurs directly at the N-terminal patatin-like phospholipase domain of the enzyme. In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibition of the major lipolytic enzymes ATGL and HSL by long-chain acyl-CoAs could represent an effective feedback mechanism controlling lipolysis and protecting cells from lipotoxic concentrations of fatty acids and fatty acid-derived lipid metabolites.

Abstract: Analysis of the polar lipids of many pathogenic and non-pathogenic clostridia has revealed the presence of plasmalogens, alk-1′-enyl ether-containing phospholipids and glycolipids. An exception to this finding so far has been Clostridium difficile, an important human pathogen which is the cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and other more serious complications. We have examined the polar lipids of three strains of C. difficile by thin-layer chromatography and have found acid-labile polar lipids indicative of the presence of plasmalogens. The lipids from one of these strains were subjected to further analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS), which revealed the presence of phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, monohexosyldiradylglycerol, dihexosyldiradylglycerol, and two unusual glycolipids identified as an aminohexosyl-hexosyldiradylglycerol, and a trihexosyldiradylglycerol. High resolution tandem mass spectrometry determined that monohexosyldiradylglycerol, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol contained significant amounts of plasmalogens. C. difficile thus joins the growing list of clostridia that have plasmalogens. Since plasmalogens in clostridia are formed by an anaerobic pathway distinct from those in animal cells, their formation represents a potential novel target for antibiotic action.

One precursor, three apolipoproteins: The relationship between two crustacean lipoproteins, the large discoidal lipoprotein and the high density lipoprotein/β-glucan binding protein,

Abstract: The novel discoidal lipoprotein (dLp) recently detected in the crayfish, differs from other crustacean lipoproteins in its large size, apoprotein composition and high lipid binding capacity. We identified the dLp sequence by transcriptome analyses of the hepatopancreas and mass spectrometry. Further de novo assembly of the NGS data followed by BLAST searches using the sequence of the high density lipoprotein/β-glucan binding protein (HDL–BGBP) of Astacus leptodactylus as query revealed a putative precursor molecule with an open reading frame of 14.7kb and a deduced primary structure of 4889 amino acids. The presence of an N-terminal lipid binding domain and a DUF 1943 domain suggests the relationship with the large lipid transfer proteins. Two putative dibasic furin cleavage sites were identified bordering the sequence of the HDL–BGBP. When subjected to mass spectroscopic analyses, tryptic peptides of the large apoprotein of dLp matched the N-terminal part of the precursor, while the peptides obtained for its small apoprotein matched the C-terminal part. Repeating the analysis in the prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii revealed a similar protein with identical domain architecture suggesting that our findings do not represent an isolated instance. Our results indicate that the above three apolipoproteins (i.e HDL–BGBP and both the large and the small subunit of dLp) are translated as a large precursor. Cleavage at the furin type sites releases two subunits forming a heterodimeric dLP particle, while the remaining part forms an HDL–BGBP whose relationship with other lipoproteins as well as specific functions are yet to be elucidated.

Abstract: In eukaryotic cells, phospholipids are synthesized exclusively in the defined organelles specific for each phospholipid species. To explain the reason for this compartmental specificity in the case of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, we constructed and characterized a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that lacked endogenous phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferases but had a recombinant PE methyltransferase from Acetobacter aceti, which was fused with a mitochondrial targeting signal from yeast Pet100p and a 3×HA epitope tag. This fusion protein, which we named as mitopmt, was determined to be localized to the mitochondria by fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. The expression of mitopmt suppressed the choline auxotrophy of a double deletion mutant of PEM1 and PEM2 (pem1Δpem2Δ) and enabled it to synthesize PC in the absence of choline. This growth suppression was observed even if the Kennedy pathway was inactivated by the repression of PCT1 encoding CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, suggesting that PC synthesized in the mitochondria is distributed to other organelles without going through the salvage pathway. The pem1Δpem2Δ strain deleted for PSD1 encoding the mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase was able to grow because of the expression of mitopmt in the presence of ethanolamine, implying that PE from other organelles, probably from the ER, was converted to PC by mitopmt. These results suggest that PC could move out of the mitochondria, and raise the possibility that its movement is not under strict directional limitations.

Abstract: The nuclear receptor PPARγ acts as a key modulator of lipid metabolism, inflammation and pathogenesis in BCG-infected macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in PPARγ expression and functions during infection are not completely understood. Here, we investigate signaling pathways triggered by TLR2, the involvement of co-receptors and lipid rafts in the mechanism of PPARγ expression, lipid body formation and cytokine synthesis in macrophages during BCG infection. BCG induces NF-κB activation and increased PPARγ expression in a TLR2-dependent manner. Furthermore, BCG-triggered increase of lipid body biogenesis was inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662, but not by the NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23. In contrast, KC/CXCL1 production was largely dependent on NF-κB but not on PPARγ. BCG infection induced increased expression of CD36 in macrophages in vitro. Moreover, CD36 co-immunoprecipitates with TLR2 in BCG-infected macrophages, suggesting its interaction with TLR2 in BCG signaling. Pretreatment with CD36 neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited PPARγ expression, lipid body formation and PGE2 production induced by BCG. Involvement of CD36 in lipid body formation was further confirmed by decreased BCG-induced lipid body formation in CD36 deficient macrophages. Similarly, CD14 and CD11b/CD18 blockage also inhibited BCG-induced lipid body formation, whereas TNF-α synthesis was not affected. Disruption of rafts recapitulates the latter result, inhibiting lipid body formation, but not TNF-α synthesis in BCG-infected macrophages. In conclusion, our results suggest that CD36-TLR2 cooperation and signaling compartmentalization within rafts, divert host response signaling through PPARγ-dependent and NF-κB-independent pathways, leading to increased macrophage lipid accumulation and down-modulation of macrophage response.

Abstract: The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a popular yeast expression system for the production of heterologous proteins in biotechnology. Interestingly, cell organelles which play an important role in this process have so far been insufficiently investigated. For this reason, we started a systematic approach to isolate and characterize organelles from P. pastoris. In this study, we present a procedure to isolate microsomal membranes at high purity. These samples represent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions which were subjected to molecular analysis of lipids and proteins. Organelle lipidomics included a detailed analysis of glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, sterols and sphingolipids. The microsomal proteome analyzed by mass spectrometry identified typical proteins of the ER known from other cell types, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also a number of unassigned gene products. The lipidome and proteome analysis of P. pastoris microsomes are prerequisite for a better understanding of functions of this organelle and for modifying this compartment for biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Pdr16p is considered a factor of clinical azole resistance in fungal pathogens. The most distinct phenotype of yeast cells lacking Pdr16p is their increased susceptibility to azole and morpholine antifungals. Pdr16p (also known as Sfh3p) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the Sec14 family of phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins. It facilitates transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PI) between membrane compartments in in vitro systems. We generated Pdr16pE235A, K267A mutant defective in PI binding. This PI binding deficient mutant is not able to fulfill the role of Pdr16p in protection against azole and morpholine antifungals, providing evidence that PI binding is critical for Pdr16 function in modulation of sterol metabolism in response to these two types of antifungal drugs. A novel feature of Pdr16p, and especially of Pdr16pE235A, K267A mutant, to bind sterol molecules, is observed.

Abstract: VE-cadherin is the predominant adhesion molecule in vascular endothelial cells being responsible for maintenance of the endothelial barrier function by forming adhesive contacts (adherens junctions) to neighbouring cells. We found by use of single molecule fluorescence microscopy that VE-cadherin is localised in preformed clusters when not inside adherens junctions. These clusters depend on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and are localised in cholesterol rich microdomains of mature endothelial cells as found by membrane fractionation. The ability to form and maintain VE-cadherin based junctions was probed using the laser tweezer technique, and we found that cholesterol depletion has dramatical effects on VE-cadherin mediated adhesion. While a 30% reduction of the cholesterol-level results in an increase of adhesion, excessive cholesterol depletion by about 60% leads to an almost complete loss of VE-cadherin function. Nevertheless, the cadherin concentration in the membrane and the single molecule kinetic parameters of the cadherin are not changed. Our results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton, junction-associated proteins and protein–lipid assemblies in cholesterol-rich microdomains mutually stabilise each other to form functional adhesion contacts.

Abstract: Systemic knockout of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the pivotal enzyme of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a murine phenotype that is characterized by progredient cardiac steatosis and severe heart failure. Since cardiac and vascular dysfunction have been closely related in numerous studies we investigated endothelium-dependent and -independent vessel function of ATGL knockout mice. Aortic relaxation studies and Langendorff perfusion experiments of isolated hearts showed that ATGL knockout mice suffer from pronounced micro- and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction. Experiments with agonists directly targeting vascular smooth muscle cells revealed the functional integrity of the smooth muscle cell layer. Loss of vascular reactivity was restored ~50% upon treatment of ATGL knockout mice with the PPARα agonist Wy14,643, indicating that this phenomenon is partly a consequence of impaired cardiac contractility. Biochemical analysis revealed that aortic endothelial NO synthase expression and activity were significantly reduced in ATGL deficiency. Enzyme activity was fully restored in ATGL mice treated with the PPARα agonist. Biochemical analysis of perivascular adipose tissue demonstrated that ATGL knockout mice suffer from perivascular inflammatory oxidative stress which occurs independent of cardiac dysfunction and might contribute to vascular defects. Our results reveal a hitherto unrecognized link between disturbed lipid metabolism, obesity and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Vitamin E membrane transport has been shown to involve the cholesterol transporters SR-BI, ABCA1 and NPC1L1. Our aim was to investigate the possible participation of another cholesterol transporter in cellular vitamin E efflux: ABCG1. In Abcg1-deficient mice, vitamin E concentration was reduced in plasma lipoproteins whereas most tissues displayed a higher vitamin E content compared to wild-type mice. α- and γ-tocopherol efflux was increased in CHO cells overexpressing human ABCG1 compared to control cells. Conversely, α- and γ-tocopherol efflux was decreased in ABCG1-knockdown human cells (Hep3B hepatocytes and THP-1 macrophages). Interestingly, α- and γ-tocopherol significantly downregulated ABCG1 and ABCA1 expression levels in Hep3B and THP-1, an effect confirmed in vivo in rats given vitamin E for 5days. This was likely due to reduced LXR activation by oxysterols, as Hep3B cells and rat liver treated with vitamin E displayed a significantly reduced content in oxysterols compared to their respective controls. Overall, the present study reveals for the first time that ABCG1 is involved in cellular vitamin E efflux.

Abstract: The patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3, also called adiponutrin, ADPN) is a membrane-bound protein highly expressed in the liver. The genetic variant I148M (rs738409) was found to be associated with progression of chronic liver disease. We aimed to establish a protein purification protocol in a yeast system (Pichia pastoris) and to examine the human PNPLA3 enzymatic activity, substrate specificity and the I148M mutation effect. hPNPLA3 148I wild type and 148M mutant cDNA were cloned into P. pastoris expression vectors. Yeast cells were grown in 3L fermentors. PNPLA3 protein was purified from membrane fractions by Ni-affinity chromatography. Enzymatic activity was assessed using radiolabeled substrates. Both 148I wild type and 148M mutant proteins are localized to the membrane. The wild type protein shows a predominant lipase activity with mild lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase activity (LPAAT) and the I148M mutation results in a loss of function of both these activities. Our data show that PNPLA3 has a predominant lipase activity and I148M mutation results in a loss of function.

Abstract: Acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family members (ACSLs) are a family of enzymes that convert long-chain free fatty acids into their acyl-CoAs and play an important role in fatty acid metabolism. Here we show the role of ACSL isozymes in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Treatment of 3Y1 cells with triacsin C, an ACSL inhibitor, markedly enhanced the IL-1β-induced prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Acsl4 expression increased significantly the release of AA metabolites, including PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α, compared with replicated control cells, whereas knockdown of Acsl1 expression reduced the IL-1β-induced release of AA metabolites. Experiments with double knockdown of Acsl4 and intracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) isozymes revealed that cytosolic PLA2α, but not calcium-independent PLA2s, is involved in the Acsl4 knockdown-enhanced PG biosynthesis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of cellular phospholipids bearing AA showed that the levels of some, if not all, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol species in Acsl4 knockdown cells were decreased after IL-1β stimulation, while those in control cells were not so obviously decreased. In Acsl1 knockdown cells, the levels of some AA-bearing PC species were reduced even in the unstimulated condition. Collectively, these results suggest that Acsl isozymes play distinct roles in the control of AA remodeling in rat fibroblasts: Acsl4 acts as the first step of enzyme for AA remodeling following IL-1β stimulation, and Acsl1 is involved in the maintenance of some AA-containing PC species.

Abstract: The pancreatic lipase gene family displays various substrate selectivities for triglycerides and phospholipids. The structural basis for this difference in substrate specificity has not been definitively established. Based on a kinetic comparative study between various pancreatic lipase family members, we showed here that porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL), which was so far classified as “classical lipase”, was able to hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (PC). Amino acid sequence alignments revealed that Val260 residue in PPL lid could be critical for the interaction with lipid substrate. Molecular dynamics was applied to investigate PC binding modes within the catalytic cavity of PPL and human pancreatic lipase (HPL), aiming to explain the difference of specificity of these enzymes towards phospholipids. Results showed that with HPL, the oxyanion hole was not able to accommodate the PC molecule, suggesting that no activity could be obtained. With PPL, the formation of a large pocket involving Val260 allowed the PC molecule to come near the catalytic residues, suggesting that it could be hydrolyzed. One more interesting finding is that human pancreatic lipase related protein 2 could hydrolyze phospholipids through its PLA1 and PLA2 activities. Overall, our study shed the light on new structural features of the phospholipase activity of pancreatic lipase family members.

Abstract: The S447X polymorphism in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which shortens LPL by two amino acids, is associated with low plasma triglyceride levels and reduced risk for coronary heart disease. S447X carriers have higher LPL levels in the pre- and post-heparin plasma, raising the possibility that the S447X polymorphism leads to higher LPL levels within capillaries. One potential explanation for increased amounts of LPL in capillaries would be more avid binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 (the protein that binds LPL dimers and shuttles them to the capillary lumen). This explanation seems plausible because sequences within the carboxyl terminus of LPL are known to mediate LPL binding to GPIHBP1. To assess the impact of the S447X polymorphism on LPL binding to GPIHBP1, we compared the ability of internally tagged versions of wild-type LPL (WT-LPL) and S447X-LPL to bind to GPIHBP1 in both cell-based and cell-free binding assays. In the cell-based assay, we compared the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 on the surface of cultured cells. This assay revealed no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1. In the cell-free assay, we compared the binding of internally tagged WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to soluble GPIHBP1 immobilized on agarose beads. Again, no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 were observed. We conclude that increased binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 is unlikely to be the explanation for more efficient lipolysis and lower plasma triglyceride levels in S447X carriers.

Abstract: We used human cardiomyocyte-derived cells to create an in vitro model to study lipid metabolism and explored the effects of PPARγ, ACSL1 and ATGL on fatty acid-induced ER stress. Compared to oleate, palmitate treatment resulted in less intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and more ER stress, as measured by upregulation of CHOP, ATF6 and GRP78 gene expression and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (EIF2a). Both ACSL1 and PPARγ adenovirus-mediated expression augmented neutral lipid accumulation and reduced palmitate-induced upregulation of ER stress markers to levels similar to those in the oleate and control treatment groups. This suggests that increased channeling of non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) towards storage in the form of neutral lipids in lipid droplets protects against palmitate-induced ER stress. Overexpression of ATGL in cells incubated with oleate-containing medium increased NEFA release and stimulated expression of ER stress markers. Thus, inefficient creation of lipid droplets as well greater release of stored lipids induces ER stress.

Abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is related to neonatal macrosomia and an increased risk of vascular events. We hypothesized that GDM exerts qualitative effects on neonatal high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL was isolated from control (n=11) and GDM maternal/neonatal donors (n=9) and subjected to shotgun proteomics. Differences in HDL mobility were assessed by FPLC and native gel-electrophoresis. Paraoxonase (PON1) activity, cholesterol ester-transfer protein (CETP) mass and activity, phospholipid, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were quantified with commercial kits. Total anti-oxidative capacity and cholesterol efflux capability of HDLs were measured. Four proteins involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and innate immunity were differentially expressed between controls and GDM neonates. ApoM (decreased, p<0.05) and SAA1 (increased, p<0.05) showed the same differences on both, maternal and neonatal GDM HDL. Lower PON1 protein expression was corroborated by lower activity (p<0.05) which in turn was associated with attenuated anti-oxidant capacity of GDM HDL. Protein changes were accompanied by increased levels of triglycerides and decreased levels of cholesterol esters, respectively. The observed differences in GDM HDL lipid moiety may be related to CETP mass and activity alterations. The rate of cholesterol efflux from term trophoblasts to maternal and from placental endothelial cells to neonatal GDM HDL was impaired (p<0.05). In conclusion, GDM causes changes in HDL composition and is intimately associated with impaired cholesterol efflux capability as well as diminished anti-oxidative particle properties. Remodeling of neonatal GDM HDL in utero supports the hypothesis that maternal conditions in pregnancy impact neonatal lipoprotein metabolism.

Abstract: Tgl3p, Tgl4p and Tgl5p are the major triacylglycerol lipases of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzing degradation of triacylglycerols stored in lipid droplets. Previous results from our laboratory (Athenstaedt and Daum, 2005, J. Biol. Chem. 280, 37301–37309) demonstrated that a yeast strain lacking all three triacylglycerol lipases accumulates not only triacylglycerols at high amount, but also steryl esters. Here we show a metabolic link between synthesis and mobilization of non-polar lipids. In particular, we demonstrate that a block in tri-acylglycerol degradation in a tgl3∆tgl4∆tgl5∆ triple mutant lacking all major triacylglycerol lipases causes marked changes in non-polar lipid synthesis. Under these conditions formation of triacylglycerols is reduced, whereas steryl ester synthesis is enhanced as shown by quantification of non-polar lipids, in vivo labeling of lipids using [14C]oleic acid and [14C]acetic acid as precursors, and enzyme analyses in vitro. In summary, this study demonstrates that triacylglycerol metabolism and steryl ester metabolism are linked processes. The importance of balanced storage and degradation of these components for lipid homeostasis in the yeast is highlighted.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays an important role in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport in vivo by promoting cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apoA-I. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we found that ABCG1 co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 (CAV1) but not with flotillin-1 and -2. Knockdown of CAV1 expression using siRNAs significantly reduced ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux without detectable effect on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Disruption of the putative CAV1 binding site in ABCG1, through replacement of tyrosine residues at positions 487 and 489 or at positions 494 and 495 with alanine (Y487AY489A and Y494AY495A), impaired the interaction of ABCG1 with CAV1 and significantly decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. The substitution of Tyr494 and Tyr495 with Phe or Trp that resulted in an intact CAV1 binding site had no effect. Furthermore, Y494AY495A affected trafficking of ABCG1 to the cell surface. The mutant protein is mainly located intracellularly. Finally, we found that CAV1 co-immunoprecipitated with ABCG1 and regulated cholesterol efflux to reconstituted HDL in THP-1-derived macrophages upon the liver X receptor agonist treatment. These findings indicate that CAV1 interacts with ABCG1 and regulates ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

Abstract: Macrophage polarization elicits various metabolic alterations which in turn influence the polarized phenotype. Activation of glycolytic metabolism accompanies and supports macrophage pro-inflammatory M1 polarization. In contrast, M2 polarization of murine macrophages in response to the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) was linked to the up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which was necessary for coining an IL-4-polarized phenotype. Here we investigated whether similar mechanisms operate in human macrophages stimulated with IL-4. IL-4 causes only moderate changes of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and FAO, correlating with an unaltered expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 α/β (PGC-1α/β), the master transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, attenuating FAO had no effect on IL-4-induced polarization-associated gene expression. Apparently, FAO is dispensable for IL-4-induced polarization of human macrophages, pointing to fundamental differences in the metabolic requirements of macrophage phenotype alterations between mice and humans.

Abstract: Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 is the first rate limiting step in de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis. We have previously demonstrated that GPAT-1 deletion can significantly alter T cell function resulting in a T cell phenotype similar to that seen in aging. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the metabolic profile of T cells are responsible for defining specific effector functions and T cell subsets. Therefore, we determined whether T cell dysfunction in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells could be explained by changes in cellular metabolism. We show here for the first time that GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells exhibit several key metabolic defects. Striking decreases in both the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were observed in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells following CD3/CD28 stimulation indicating an inherent cellular defect in energy production. In addition, the spare respiratory capacity (SRC) of GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells, a key indicator of their ability to cope with mitochondrial stress was significantly decreased. We also observed a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells compared to their WT counterparts, indicating that GPAT-1 deficiency results in altered or dysfunctional mitochondria. These data demonstrate that deletion of GPAT-1 can dramatically alter total cellular metabolism under conditions of increased energy demand. Furthermore, altered metabolic response following stimulation may be the defining mechanism underlying T cell dysfunction in GPAT-1 −/− CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that GPAT-1 is essential for the response to the increased metabolic demands associated with T cell activation.

Abstract: Coq5 catalyzes the only C-methylation involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (Q or ubiquinone) in humans and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As one of eleven polypeptides required for Q production in yeast, Coq5 has also been shown to assemble with the multi-subunit complex termed the CoQ-synthome. In humans, mutations in several COQ genes cause primary Q deficiency, and a decrease in Q biosynthesis is associated with mitochondrial, cardiovascular, kidney and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we characterize the human COQ5 polypeptide and examine its complementation of yeast coq5 point and null mutants. We show that human COQ5 RNA is expressed in all tissues and that the COQ5 polypeptide is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane on the matrix side. Previous work in yeast has shown that point mutations within or adjacent to conserved COQ5 methyltransferase motifs result in a loss of Coq5 function but not Coq5 steady state levels. Here, we show that stabilization of the CoQ-synthome within coq5 point mutants or by over-expression of COQ8 in coq5 null mutants permits the human COQ5 homolog to partially restore coq5 mutant growth on respiratory media and Q6 content. Immunoblotting against the human COQ5 polypeptide in isolated yeast mitochondria shows that the human Coq5 polypeptide migrates in two-dimensional blue-native/SDS-PAGE at the same high molecular mass as other yeast Coq proteins. The results presented suggest that human and Escherichia coli Coq5 homologs expressed in yeast retain C-methyltransferase activity but are capable of rescuing the coq5 yeast mutants only when the CoQ-synthome is assembled.

Abstract: Alterations in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics during cancer cachexia were previously suggested; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. So, the goal of this study was to evaluate mitochondrial phospholipid remodeling in cancer-related muscle wasting and its repercussions to respiratory chain activity and fiber susceptibility to apoptosis. An animal model of urothelial carcinoma induced by exposition to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) and characterized by significant body weight loss due to skeletal muscle mass decrease was used. Morphological evidences of muscle atrophy were associated to decreased respiratory chain activity and increased expression of mitochondrial UCP3, which altogether highlight the lower ability of wasted muscle to produce ATP. Lipidomic analysis of isolated mitochondria revealed a significant decrease of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in BBN mitochondria, counteracted by increased phosphatidylcholine levels. Besides the impact on membrane fluidity, this phospholipid remodeling seems to justify, at least in part, the lower oxidative phosphorylation activity observed in mitochondria from wasted muscle and their increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Curiously, no evidences of lipid peroxidation were observed but proteins from BBN mitochondria, particularly the metabolic ones, seem more prone to carbonylation with the consequent implications in mitochondria functionality. Overall, data suggest that bladder cancer negatively impacts skeletal muscle activity specifically by affecting mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics and its interaction with proteins, ultimately leading to the dysfunction of this organelle. The regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways might be seen as potential therapeutic targets for the management of cancer-related muscle wasting.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which has been linked to dyslipidemia with potential functional impairment of lipoproteins. This cross-sectional study was designed to characterize the biological activities of plasma lipoproteins in 25 patients with psoriasis and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In the present study, we found that plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were decreased in the psoriasis group compared to healthy controls. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content in plasma, in HDL3 and in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were increased. However, the activity of plasma paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) decreased in psoriasis and negatively correlated with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Moreover, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were increased in psoriasis and positively correlated with the PASI. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was increased in psoriasis, but did not reach significance when correlated with PASI. In vitro tests displayed that the functionalities of HDL3 isolated from psoriatic patients significantly decreased, which were assessed in four independent ways, namely (1) protection against LDL oxidation, (2) inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced monocyte adherence to endothelial cells, (3) prevention of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced monocyte migration, and (4) protection of endothelial cells from TNF-α induced apoptosis. Further, pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory properties of LDL isolated from psoriatic patients were increased. In conclusion, the biological activities of psoriatic lipoproteins are impaired in both HDL and LDL, which may provide a link between psoriasis and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: The lipidome of the human lens is unique in that cholesterol and dihydrosphingomyelin are the dominant classes. Moreover, the lens lipidome is not static with dramatic changes in several sphingolipid classes associated with both aging and cataract. Accordingly, there is a clear need to expand knowledge of the molecular species that constitute the human lens sphingolipidome. In this study, human lens lipids have been extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Direct analysis of the TLC plates by desorption electrospray ionisation–mass spectrometry (DESI–MS) allowed the detection over 30 species from 11 classes of sphingolipids. Significantly, novel classes of lens lipids including sulfatides, dihydrosulfatides, lactosylceramide sulfates and dihydrolactosylceramide sulfates were identified.

Abstract: In mammals, 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid, 20:3n−9) is synthesized from oleic acid during a state of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). Mead acid is thought to be produced by the same enzymes that synthesize arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, but the genes and the pathways involved in the conversion of oleic acid to Mead acid have not been fully elucidated. The levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cultured cells are generally very low compared to those in mammalian tissues. In this study, we found that cultured cells, such as NIH3T3 and Hepa1–6 cells, have significant levels of Mead acid, indicating that cells in culture are in an EFAD state under normal culture conditions. We then examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of fatty acid desaturases and elongases on the level of Mead acid, and found that knockdown of Elovl5, Fads1, or Fads2 decreased the level of Mead acid. This and the measured levels of possible intermediate products for the synthesis of Mead acid such as 18:2n−9, 20:1n−9 and 20:2n−9 in the knocked down cells indicate two pathways for the synthesis of Mead acid: pathway 1) 18:1n−9→(Fads2)→18:2n−9→(Elovl5)→20:2n−9→(Fads1)→20:3n−9 and pathway 2) 18:1n−9→(Elovl5)→20:1n−9→(Fads2)→20:2n−9→(Fads1)→20:3n−9.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) accepts cholesterol and phospholipids from ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-expressing cells to form high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Human apoA-I has two tertiary structural domains and the C-terminal domain (approximately amino acids 190–243) plays a key role in lipid binding. Although the high lipid affinity region of the C-terminal domain of apoA-I (residues 223–243) is essential for the HDL formation, the function of low lipid affinity region (residues 191–220) remains unclear. To evaluate the role of residues 191–220, we analyzed the structure, lipid binding properties, and HDL formation activity of Δ191–220 apoA-I, in comparison to wild-type and Δ223–243 apoA-I. Although deletion of residues 191–220 has a slight effect on the tertiary structure of apoA-I, the Δ191–220 variant showed intermediate behavior between wild-type and Δ223–243 regarding the formation of hydrophobic sites and lipid interaction through the C-terminal domain. Physicochemical analysis demonstrated that defective lipid binding of Δ191–220 apoA-I is due to the decreased ability to form α-helix structure which provides the energetic source for lipid binding. In addition, the ability to form HDL particles in vitro and induce cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells of Δ191–220 apoA-I was also intermediate between wild-type and Δ223–243 apoA-I. These results suggest that despite possessing low lipid affinity, residues 191–220 play a role in enhancing the ability of apoA-I to bind to and solubilize lipids by forming α-helix upon lipid interaction. Our results demonstrate that the combination of low lipid affinity region and high lipid affinity region of apoA-I is required for efficient ABCA1-dependent HDL formation.

Abstract: Fetal serum cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations differ between preterm and term born neonates. An imbalance of the flow of cholesterol from the sites of synthesis or efflux from cells of peripheral organs to the liver, the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is linked to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preterm delivery is a risk factor for the development of CVD. Thus, we hypothesized that RCT is affected by a diminished cholesterol acceptor capacity in preterm as compared to term fetuses. Cholesterol efflux assays were performed in RAW264.7, HepG2, and HUVEC cell lines. In the presence and absence of ABC transporter overexpression by TO-901317, umbilical cord sera of preterm and term born neonates (n=28 in both groups) were added. Lipid components including high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein E were measured and related to fractional cholesterol efflux values. We found overall, fractional cholesterol efflux to remain constant between the study groups, and over gestational ages at delivery, respectively. However, correlation analysis revealed cholesterol efflux values to be predominantly related to HDL concentration at term, while in preterm neonates, cholesterol efflux was mainly associated with LDL. In conclusion cholesterol acceptor capacity during fetal development is kept in a steady state with different mechanisms and lipid fractions involved at distinct stages during the second half of fetal development. However, RCT mechanisms in preterm neonates seem not to be involved in the development of CVD later in life suggesting rather changes in the lipoprotein pattern causative.

Abstract: We provide novel insights into the function(s) of β-carotene-15,15′-oxygenase (CMOI) during embryogenesis. By performing in vivo and in vitro experiments, we showed that CMOI influences not only lecithin:retinol acyltransferase but also acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase reaction in the developing tissues at mid-gestation. In addition, LC/MS lipidomics analysis of the CMOI−/− embryos showed reduced levels of four phosphatidylcholine and three phosphatidylethanolamine acyl chain species, and of eight triacylglycerol species with four or more unsaturations and fifty-two or more carbons in the acyl chains. Cholesteryl esters of arachidonate, palmitate, linoleate, and DHA were also reduced to less than 30% of control. Analysis of the fatty acyl CoA species ruled out a loss in fatty acyl CoA synthetase capability. Comparison of acyl species suggested significantly decreased 18:2, 18:3, 20:1, 20:4, or 22:6 acyl chains within the above lipids in CMOI-null embryos. Furthermore, LCAT, ACAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA levels were also downregulated in CMOI−/− embryos. These data strongly support the notion that, in addition to cleaving β-carotene to generate retinoids, CMOI serves an additional function(s) in retinoid and lipid metabolism and point to its role in the formation of specific lipids, possibly for use in nervous system tissue.

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Elovl5 and Elovl2 differ in selectivity for elongation of omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid,

Abstract: The synthesis of the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n−3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n−3) from dietary α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n−3) requires three desaturation and three elongation steps in vertebrates. The elongation of EPA to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5n−3) can be catalysed by the elongase enzymes Elovl5 or Elovl2, but further elongation of DPA to 24:5n−3, the penultimate precursor of DHA, is limited to Elovl2, at least in mammals. Elovl5 enzymes have been characterised from seventeen fish species but Elovl2 enzymes have only been characterised in two of these fish. The essentiality of Elovl2 for DHA synthesis is unknown in fish. This study is the first to identify an Elovl2 in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and functionally characterise the Elovl5 and Elovl2 using a yeast expression system. Elovl5 was active with C18–20 PUFA substrates and not C22 PUFA. In contrast, Elovl2 was active with C20–22 PUFA substrates and not C18 PUFA. Thus, rainbow trout is dependent on Elovl2 for DPA to 24:5n−3 synthesis and ultimately DHA synthesis. The expression of elovl5 was significantly higher than elovl2 in liver. Elucidating this dependence on Elovl2 to elongate DPA and the low elovl2 gene expression compared with elovl5 are critical findings in understanding the potential for rainbow trout to synthesize DHA.

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays the ability to perform bioconversion of oleic acid into a class of hydroxylated fatty acids known as oxylipins. A diol synthase activity is responsible for such a conversion, which proceeds through the dioxygenation of oleic acid to release hydroperoxide 10-H(P)OME ((10S)-hydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid), followed by conversion of the hydroperoxide intermediate into 7,10-DiHOME ((7S,10S)-dihydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid), both of which accumulate in the culture supernatant. Several mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were analyzed for the production of 10-H(P)OME and 7,10-DiHOME and two of them (ORFs PA2077 and PA2078), unable to release hydroxylated fatty acids, were detected and selected for further analysis. Involvement of ORFs PA2077 and PA2078 in oleate-diol synthase activity was confirmed, and their respective role in the conversion of oleic acid was analyzed by mutation complementation. Activity restoration revealed that gene PA2077 codes for the 10S-dioxygenase activity (10S-DOX) responsible for the first step of the reaction, whereas PA2078 encodes for the (7S,10S)-hydroperoxide diol synthase enzyme (7,10-DS) which allows the conversion of 10-H(P)OME into 7,10-DiHOME. Heterologous expression of both enzymes separately showed that no hetero-complex formation is required for enzymatic activity. Bioinformatics and RT-PCR analysis revealed that both genes constitute a new fine regulated oleate-diol synthase operon, originated by a gene duplication event followed by neofunctionalization for environmental adaptation, being unprecedented in prokaryotes.

Higher level of plasma bioactive molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate in women is associated with estrogen,

Abstract: Both sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and estrogen have been documented to play endothelial protective roles. However, it remains unclear whether estrogen could regulate the anabolism of the bioactive molecule S1P and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, 108 healthy participants were separated into three age groups, and their plasma S1P levels were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that the plasma S1P levels were significantly higher in women than those in men within the age of 16–55years old and higher in pre-menopausal than post-menopausal women. The experiment in C57 BL/6 mice confirmed the gender difference of plasma S1P level. In vitro study demonstrated that after the stimulation of 17β-estradiol (E2), S1P levels both in EA.hy926 cells and the culture media were increased about 9 and 3 times, respectively; the mRNA expression, the protein level and the activity of sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1, not SphK2, were markedly increased; the mRNA and protein expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) C1, G2 and S1P transporter spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) were significantly elevated; furthermore, the mRNA and protein expressions of S1P receptors (S1PRs) 1–2 were increased in a time-dependent manner. This study suggests that E2 markedly improves S1P synthesis by activating SphK1 and induces S1P export via activating ABCC1, G2 and Spns2 from endothelium system, which may consequently lead to the gender difference of plasma S1P in adult human and mouse. The results of this study suggest that E2 may exert its vasculoprotective function by activation of the SphK1–S1P–S1PR signaling axis.
