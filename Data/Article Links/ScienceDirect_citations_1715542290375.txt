Abstract: Transplantation of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) has been used as a therapeutic strategy for vascular repair. However, it remains controversial whether BM-EPCs exhibit clonal endothelial colony-forming cell (ECFC) capacity, a characteristic of true EPCs. The aim of this study was to isolate and explore the cellular properties of BM-ECFCs. We isolated BM-ECFCs from rat bone marrow with high purity via an optimized method. This approach involved the removal of selective colonies based on the conventional differential adhesive culture method used to isolate ECFCs from peripheral and umbilical cord blood. Our results indicate that primary colony BM-ECFCs display a panel of surface antigen markers consistent with endothelial cells. These BM-ECFCs coexpress CD34, CD133, and VEGFR2 at high levels, and these levels decrease with passaging. These cells have high potential for proliferation, migration, and formation of capillary-like structures on Matrigel, and these abilities are retained during ex vivo expansion. Furthermore, BM-ECFCs cultured with 10% or 20% fetal bovine serum demonstrated two different patterns of spontaneous capillary-like structure formation. These results provide a foundation for isolation of ECFCs from human bone marrow for autologous cell transplantation and tissue engineering applications in the future.

Abstract: ROS are frequently associated with deleterious effects caused by oxidative stress. Despite the harmful effects of non-specific oxidation, ROS also function as signal transduction molecules that regulate various biological processes, including stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that mitochondrial ROS level determines cell fate during differentiation of the pluripotent stem cell line P19. As stem cells in general, P19 cells are characterized by a low respiration activity, accompanied by a low level of ROS formation. Nevertheless, we found that P19 cells contain fully assembled mitochondrial electron transport chain supercomplexes (respirasomes), suggesting that low respiration activity may serve as a protective mechanism against ROS. Upon elevated mitochondrial ROS formation, the proliferative potential of P19 cells is decreased due to longer S phase of the cell cycle. Our data show that besides being harmful, mitochondrial ROS production regulates the differentiation potential of P19 cells: elevated mitochondrial ROS level favours trophoblast differentiation, whereas preventing neuron differentiation. Therefore, our results suggest that mitochondrial ROS level serves as an important factor that directs differentiation towards certain cell types while preventing others.

Abstract: Although persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection exerts a crucial influence on cervical carcinogenesis, other factors are also involved in its development, such as intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. B7-H3 and B7-H4, which have been reported to be co-regulatory ligands in the B7 family, had been found to be overexpressed in cervical cancer and correlated with adverse clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in our previous studies. In this study, we sought to explore the effects of B7-H3 and B7-H4 on the cervical microenvironment. Among several immune cytokines, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 stand out as important immunosuppressive factors. Our studies found that IL-10 expression increased with pathological change levels and significantly correlated with cervical cancer differentiation (P < 0.05). TGF-β1 correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P < 0.01). Expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 positively correlated with the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β1. After co-culture, we found that overexpression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 in cervical cancer cell lines resulted in activation of the cell cycle and decreased apoptosis of U-937 cells. In addition, the contents of IL-10 and TGF-β1, as well as their protein expression levels, increased in co-culture supernatants in U-937 cells, suggesting regulation by the p-JAK2/STAT3 pathway. The in vivo results demonstrated that with the increasing expression of B7-H3/B7-H4, the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β1 also increased significantly. Overall, the expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 favored an immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting the production of IL-10 and TGF-β1, thereby resulting in progression of cervical carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells (ECs) are of great value for cell therapy, tissue engineering, and drug discovery. Obtaining high-quantity and -quality ECs remains very challenging. Here, we report a method for the scalable manufacturing of ECs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). hPSCs are expanded and differentiated into ECs in a 3D thermoreversible PNIPAAm-PEG hydrogel. The hydrogel protects cells from hydrodynamic stresses in the culture vessel and prevents cells from excessive agglomeration, leading to high-culture efficiency including high-viability (>90%), high-purity (>80%), and high-volumetric yield (2.0 × 107 cells/mL). These ECs (i.e., 3D-ECs) had similar properties as ECs made using 2D culture systems (i.e., 2D-ECs). Genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that 3D-ECs had higher expression of genes related to vasculature development, extracellular matrix, and glycolysis, while 2D-ECs had higher expression of genes related to cell proliferation.

Abstract: Crosstalk occurs between dyslipidemia and chronic inflammation, which are both precipitants of atherosclerosis. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) plays a key role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. The present study investigated the effects of SCAP dysfunction on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and lipid metabolism in THP-1 macrophages. Intracellular cholesterol content was assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantitative assays. The expression of SCAP, HMGCR, pro-IL-1β and N-SREBP2, p65(N) in the nucleus were examined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The level of secretary proteins IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1 in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. The translocation of SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi was detected by confocal microscopy. Our results demonstrated that over-expression of SCAP significantly increased the expression of HMGCR, pro-IL-1β in the cytoplasm, and mature IL-1β, TNF-α, MCP-1 in the supernatants, while knocking down SCAP dramatically decreased the expression of these molecules. Betulin effectively suppressed the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in the SCAP over-expressed THP-1 macrophages, but did not affect the expression of inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the pro-inflammatory effect of SCAP was independent of its routine role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating the crosstalk between dyslipidemia and inflammatory responses. Knocking down SCAP attenuated LPS-induced IκB phosphorylation and reduced the nuclear level of p65, while over-expression of SCAP increased the nuclear level of p65. Knocking down p65 abolished the proinflammatory effect represented by elevated expression of the inflammatory mediators in the SCAP over-expressed THP-1 macrophages, suggesting that SCAP dysfunction stimulated inflammatory responses via activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, the cholesterol sensor SCAP plays a role in regulating the expression of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in THP-1 macrophages. SCAP mediates the inflammatory response via activating the NF-κB pathway. This new function of SCAP is independent of its role in lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has led to kinds of clinical disorders and great morbidity worldwide, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), mental retardation, and developmental delays in immunocompromised individuals. Congenital HCMV infection is a leading cause of birth defects, primarily manifesting as neurological disorders. Previous studies reported that HCMV has evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade the immune system, such as dysregulation of miRNAs. However, reports concerning the role of miRNA in HCMV infection in neural cells are limited. Here, we reported that a host microRNA, miR-182, was significantly up-regulated by HCMV infection in U-251MG and NPCs cells. Subsequently, our results of in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-182 was a positive regulator of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) by directly targeting FOXO3, resulting in the induction of IFN-I response and suppression of HCMV replication in neural cells. Taken together, our findings provide detailed molecular mechanisms of the antiviral function of miR-182 against HCMV infection in neural cells, and suggest an intrinsic anti-HCMV therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) display substantial heterogeneity in gene expression, implying the existence of discrete substates within the stem cell compartment. To determine whether these substates impact fate decisions of hESCs we used a GFP reporter line to investigate the properties of fractions of putative undifferentiated cells defined by their differential expression of the endoderm transcription factor, GATA6, together with the hESC surface marker, SSEA3. By single-cell cloning, we confirmed that substates characterized by expression of GATA6 and SSEA3 include pluripotent stem cells capable of long-term self-renewal. When clonal stem cell colonies were formed from GATA6-positive and GATA6-negative cells, more of those derived from GATA6-positive cells contained spontaneously differentiated endoderm cells than similar colonies derived from the GATA6-negative cells. We characterized these discrete cellular states using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, identifying a potential role for SOX17 in the establishment of the endoderm-biased stem cell state.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin B12 is made by only certain prokaryotes yet is required by a number of eukaryotes such as mammals, fish, birds, worms, and Protista, including algae. There is still much to learn about how this nutrient is trafficked across the domains of life. Herein, we describe ways to make a number of different corrin analogs with fluorescent groups attached to the main tetrapyrrole-derived ring. A further range of analogs were also constructed by attaching similar fluorescent groups to the ribose ring of cobalamin, thereby generating a range of complete and incomplete corrinoids to follow uptake in bacteria, worms, and plants. By using these fluorescent derivatives we were able to demonstrate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to acquire both cobyric acid and cobalamin analogs, that Caenorhabditis elegans takes up only the complete corrinoid, and that seedlings of higher plants such as Lepidium sativum are also able to transport B12.

Abstract: A simple and reproducible procedure was developed to measure the volume of liquid microinjected into cells. A calibration curve of droplet fluorescence intensity versus volume was constructed by injecting a fluorescent dextran solution through a 125–150 µm diameter micropipette into an oil-filled culture dish to create a spray of varied-sized droplets. The droplets retained a spherical shape because they were in an oil medium and they settled onto a glass surface coated with a superhydrophobic surface. Fluorescent micrographs of the droplets were obtained and analyzed with Image-J software to quantify the fluorescence intensity and radius of each spherical droplet to produce the calibration curve. Subsequently, Dut-145 human prostate carcinoma cells were microinjected with the same fluorescent dextran solution and fluorescent micrographs of the cells were obtained using the identical exposure conditions used to photograph the droplets. The measured fluorescence intensity of the microinjected cells was entered into the formula for the regression line that was fit to the calibration curve allowing determination of the volume of solution injected into each cell. Thus, a mixture consisting of known concentrations of a test material of test material (macromolecules, drugs, etc.) and a fluorescent dextran, volumetric, tracer can be used to quantify the relationship between the amount of a microinjected material and subsequent effects on cells.

Abstract: Leukemia is a malignance with complex pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Discovery of noval regulators amenable to leukemia could be of value to gain insight into the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Here, we conducted a large-scale shRNA library screening for functional regulators in the development of myeloid cells in primary cells. We identified eighteen candidate regulators in the primary screening. Those genes cover a wide range of cellular functions, including gene expression regulation, intracellular signaling transduction, nucleotide excision repair, cell cycle control and transcription regulation. In both primary screening and validation, shRNAs targeting Tcea1, encoding the transcription elongation factor A (SII) 1, exhibited the greatest influence on the proliferative potential of cells. Knocking down the expression of Tcea1 in the 32Dcl3 myeloid cell line led to enhanced proliferation of myeloid cells and blockage of myeloid differentiation induced by G-CSF. In addition, silence of Tcea1 inhibited apoptosis of myeloid cells. Thus, Tcea1 was identified as a gene which can influence the proliferative potential, survival and differentiation of myeloid cells. These findings have implications for how transcriptional elongation influences myeloid cell development and leukemic transformation.

The suppression effect of dendritic cells maturation by adipose-derived stem cells through TGF-β1 related pathway,

Abstract: Background
Our previous studies demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could modulate regulatory T cells (Treg) and prolong hind-limb allotransplant survival in vitro and in vivo. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanism of ASCs in modulating DC maturation.
Materials and Methods
ASCs were isolated from rodent adipose tissue, DCs were derived from the bone marrow, and CD4+ T cells were purified from splenocytes. DCs were co-cultured with ASCs to evaluate the suppressive effects of ASCs. CD4+ T-cells were co-cultured with DCs pre-treated with or without ASCs. The cell surface markers of DCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. T-cell proliferation was analyzed by the BrdU proliferation test. Tolerogenic cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expressions after different treatments were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA analysis.
Result
ASCs suppressed DC maturation as evidenced by low expressions of CD80, CD86, and MHC-II. Also, ASC-treated mature DCs showed higher levels of TGF-β1, IL-10, and IDO expressions, as compared to that in matured DCs (mDCs) alone. ASC-treated mDCs co-cultured with CD4+ T cells revealed a significant higher percentage of Treg than mDC without treatment. The IDO level in ASC-treated mDCs and Treg induction effects were blocked by the ASCs pre-treated with TGF-β1 siRNAs, but not IL-10 siRNAs.
Conclusion
ASC-modulated DC maturation correlated with TGF-β1 secretion, IDO expression, and Treg induction. ASCs could be used as a potential immunomodulatory strategy for clinical application in allotransplantation.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we deep-sequenced the mtDNA of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and hiPSCs) and their source cells and found that the majority of variants pre-existed in the cells used to establish the lines. Early-passage hESCs carried few and low-load heteroplasmic variants, similar to those identified in oocytes and inner cell masses. The number and heteroplasmic loads of these variants increased with prolonged cell culture. The study of 120 individual cells of early- and late-passage hESCs revealed a significant diversity in mtDNA heteroplasmic variants at the single-cell level and that the variants that increase during time in culture are always passenger to the appearance of chromosomal abnormalities. We found that early-passage hiPSCs carry much higher loads of mtDNA variants than hESCs, which single-fibroblast sequencing proved pre-existed in the source cells. Finally, we show that these variants are stably transmitted during short-term differentiation.

Abstract: We have investigated the differentiation of paraxial mesoderm from mouse embryonic stem cells utilizing a Tbx6-EYFP/Brachyury (T)-Cherry dual reporter system. Differentiation from the mouse ESC state directly into mesoderm via Wnt pathway activation was low, but augmented by treatment with AGN193109, a pan-retinoic acid receptor inverse agonist. After five days of differentiation, T+ cells increased from 12.2% to 18.8%, Tbx6+ cells increased from 5.8% to 12.7%, and T+/Tbx6+ cells increased from 2.4% to 14.1%. The synergism of AGN193109 with Wnt3a/CHIR99021 was further substantiated by the increased expression of paraxial mesoderm gene markers Tbx6, Msgn1, Meox1, and Hoxb1. Separate to inverse agonist treatment, when mouse ESCs were indirectly differentiated into mesoderm via a transient epiblast step the efficiency of paraxial mesoderm formation markedly increased. Tbx6+ cells represented 65–75% of the total cell population after just 3 days of differentiation and the expression of paraxial mesoderm marker genes Tbx6 and Msgn increased over 100-fold and 300-fold, respectively. Further evaluation of AGN193109 treatment on the indirect differentiation protocol suggested that RARs have two distinct roles. First, AGN193109 treatment at the epiblast step and mesoderm step promoted paraxial mesoderm formation over other mesoderm and endoderm lineage types. Second, continued treatment during mesoderm formation revealed its ability to repress the maturation of presomitic mesoderm into somitic paraxial mesoderm. Thus, the continuous treatment of AGN193109 during epiblast and mesoderm differentiation steps yielded a culture where ~90% of the cells were Tbx6+. The surprisingly early effect of inverse agonist treatment at the epiblast step of differentiation led us to further examine the effect of AGN193109 treatment during an extended epiblast differentiation protocol. Interestingly, while inverse agonist treatment had no impact on the conversion of ESCs into epiblast cells based on the expression of Rex1, Fgf5, and pluripotency marker genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, after three days of differentiation in the presence of AGN193109 caudal epiblast and early paraxial mesoderm marker genes, T, Cyp26a1, Fgf8, Tbx6 and Msgn were all highly up-regulated. Collectively, our studies reveal an earlier than appreciated role for RARs in epiblast cells and the modulation of their function via inverse agonist treatment can promote their differentiation into the paraxial mesoderm lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is a bacterial exotoxin that enters host cells and induces mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the extent to which VacA-dependent mitochondrial perturbations affect overall cellular metabolism is poorly understood. We report that VacA perturbations in mitochondria are linked to alterations in cellular amino acid homeostasis, which results in the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and subsequent autophagy. mTORC1, which regulates cellular metabolism during nutrient stress, is inhibited during Hp infection by a VacA-dependent mechanism. This VacA-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signaling is linked to the dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface and results in activation of cellular autophagy through the Unc 51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1) complex. VacA intoxication results in reduced cellular amino acids, and bolstering amino acid pools prevents VacA-mediated mTORC1 inhibition. Overall, these studies support a model that Hp modulate host cell metabolism through the action of VacA at mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
The enediynes, microbial natural products with extraordinary cytotoxicities, have been translated into clinical drugs. Two self-resistance mechanisms are known in the enediyne producers—apoproteins for the nine-membered enediynes and self-sacrifice proteins for the ten-membered enediyne calicheamicin. Here we show that: (1) tnmS1, tnmS2, and tnmS3 encode tiancimycin (TNM) resistance in its producer Streptomyces sp. CB03234, (2) tnmS1, tnmS2, and tnmS3 homologs are found in all anthraquinone-fused enediyne producers, (3) TnmS1, TnmS2, and TnmS3 share a similar β barrel-like structure, bind TNMs with nanomolar KD values, and confer resistance by sequestration, and (4) TnmS1, TnmS2, and TnmS3 homologs are widespread in nature, including in the human microbiome. These findings unveil an unprecedented resistance mechanism for the enediynes. Mechanisms of self-resistance in producers serve as models to predict and combat future drug resistance in clinical settings. Enediyne-based chemotherapies should now consider the fact that the human microbiome harbors genes encoding enediyne resistance.

Abstract: Nonmuscle myosin-IIA (NMHC-IIA) heavy chain phosphorylation has gained recognition as an important feature of myosin-II regulation. In previous work, we showed that phosphorylation on S1943 promotes myosin-IIA filament disassembly in vitro and enhances EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension of breast tumor cells. However, the contribution of NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation to the modulation of invasive cellular behavior and metastasis has not been examined. Stable expression of phosphomimetic (S1943E) or non-phosphorylatable (S1943A) NMHC-IIA in breast cancer cells revealed that S1943 phosphorylation enhances invadopodia function, and is critical for matrix degradation in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo. These studies demonstrate a novel link between NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation, the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: The Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), belonging to a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, is involved in regulating neural development. However, the role of RKIP in microglial cells stimulated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) has not been determined. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of RKIP and its underlying mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Our results showed that the expression of RKIP was significantly reduced in BV-2 cells treated with MPP+. Overexpression of RKIP markedly rescued cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis in BV-2 cells exposed to MPP+. In addition, overexpression of RKIP inhibited MPP+-induced the production of pro-inflammatory molecules in BV-2 cells. Similar results were observed in primary microglial cells isolated from neonatal mice. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms of its action indicated that overexpression of RKIP prevented the activation of NF-κB and MEK/ERK pathways in MPP+-stimulated BV-2 cells. Taken together, these findings indicated that RKIP suppresses apoptosis and inflammation in MPP+-treated microglial cells through the inactivation of NF-κB and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Thus, RKIP may be a promising target molecular involving in the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Viral envelope proteins are required for productive viral entry and initiation of infection. Although the humoral immune system provides ample evidence for targeting envelope proteins as an antiviral strategy, there are few pharmacological interventions that have this mode of action. In contrast to classical antiviral targets such as viral proteases and polymerases, viral envelope proteins as a class do not have a well-conserved active site that can be rationally targeted with small molecules. We previously identified compounds that inhibit dengue virus by binding to its envelope protein, E. Here, we show that these small molecules inhibit dengue virus fusion and map the binding site of these compounds to a specific pocket on E. We further demonstrate inhibition of Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses by these compounds, providing pharmacological evidence for the pocket as a target for developing broad-spectrum antivirals against multiple, mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is one of the major barriers for tumor chemotherapy. It is clinically known that chemoresistance increases during tumor progression. Additionally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is also remodeled during tumor progression. However, it remains unclear how ECM remodeling contributes to chemoresistance acquisition. Recently, it has been reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to chemoresistance acquisition. Here, how ECM remodeling contributes to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance acquisition was investigated from the viewpoints of EMT using in vitro ECM models mimicking native ECM in colorectal tumor tissue at three different malignant levels. 5-FU partially induced EMT and increased ABCB1 in colorectal HT-29 cells via TGF-β signaling (an invasive tumor cell model). When HT-29 cells were cultured on an ECM model (high malignant matrices) mimicking native ECM in highly malignant tumor tissues, the cells facilitated TGF-β-induced EMT and increased ABCB1 upregulation compared with that of other ECM models mimicking the low malignant level and normal tissues. High malignant matrices contained more chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains than those of other ECM models. Finally, CS chain-reduced high malignant matrices could not facilitate ABCB1 upregulation and TGF-β-induced EMT. These results demonstrated that ECM remodeling during tumor progression increased CS chains to facilitate EMT and ABCB1 upregulation, contributing to chemoresistance acquisition.

Abstract: Phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1(PAG1) is a ubiquitous protein that is essential for the development and progression of various malignancies. A previous study in our laboratory confirmed that PAG1 plays an important role in modulating the inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly defined. In this study, we found that PAG1 was significantly increased in laryngeal cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (P < 0.05). The expression of PAG1 was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05) and TNM stage (P < 0.05). High expression of PAG1 also predicted a poor prognosis in patients with laryngeal cancer. Moreover, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that PAG1 overexpression was able to promote growth, increase migration and invasion, and enhance inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the activation of STAT3 was required for PAG1-mediated inherent radioresistance of laryngeal cancer. Inhibition of STAT3 activity with a chemical inhibitor sensitized radioresistant cells to radiation. Importantly, PAG1-integrin β1 complex was involved in the regulation of STAT3 activation. In addition, downregulation of PAG1 could suppress tumor growth and reverse inherent radioresistance in the nude mouse xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggested that PAG1 conferred inherent radioresistance by activating STAT3, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer.

Abstract: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, growth retardation, broad thumbs and toes and mild to severe intellectual disability, caused by heterozygous mutations in either CREBBP or EP300 genes, encoding the homologous CBP and p300 lysine-acetyltransferases and transcriptional coactivators. No RSTS in vitro induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-neuronal model is available yet to achieve mechanistic insights on cognitive impairment of RSTS patients. We established iPSC-derived neurons (i-neurons) from peripheral blood cells of three CREBBP- and two EP300-mutated patients displaying different levels of intellectual disability, and four unaffected controls. Pan neuronal and cortical-specific markers were expressed by all patients' i-neurons. Altered morphology of patients' differentiating neurons, showing reduced branch length and increased branch number, and hypoexcitability of differentiated neurons emerged as potential disease biomarkers. Anomalous neuronal morphology and reduced excitability varied across different RSTS patients' i-neurons. Further studies are needed to validate these markers and assess whether they reflect cognitive and behavioural impairment of the donor patients.

Abstract: Low levels of inflammation-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) play a crucial role in articular cartilage matrix destruction in osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), an important member in the IRF family, plays a key role in regulating the inflammation-related signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the physiological roles of IRF-8 in the pathological progression of OA. We found that IRF-8 was expressed in human primary chondrocytes. Interestingly, the expression of IRF-8 was upregulated in OA chondrocytes. In addition, IRF-8 was increased in response to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment, mediated by the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway. Overexpression of IRF-8 in human chondrocytes by transduction with lentiviral-IRF-8 exacerbated IL-1β-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) in human chondrocytes. In contrast, knockdown of IRF-8 inhibited IL-1β-induced expression of MMP-13. Importantly, IRF-8 could bind to the promoter of MMP-13 and stimulate its activity. Additionally, overexpression of IRF-8 exacerbated IL-1β-induced degradation of type II collagen. However, silencing IRF-8 abrogated the degradation of type II collagen. Taken together, our findings identified a novel function of IRF-8 in regulating articular cartilage matrix destruction by promoting the expression of MMP-13.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a densely vascularized tumor that is highly dependent on angiogenic pathways to direct arterial blood flow to the growing neoplasm, though little is known about how the interaction of tumor and endothelial cells drives these processes and the degree of clinical importance. To this end, we examined the intercellular cross-talk between HepG2 (human HCC) and human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in a co-culture system that mimics some aspects of initial tumor parenchyma and stroma interactions. The results showed that the remote cell-to-cell (paracrine) interactions between HepG2 cells and EPC play a critical role in the differentiation and angiogenic activity of endothelial cells, possibly through intercellular signaling function of the exosomes released in the medium by HepG2 cells. The tumor-cell activated phenotype of EPC was associated with increased migration and elevated expression of ephrin-B2, and Delta-like 4 ligand (DLL4). Furthermore, ephrin-B2 was found to be overexpressed in HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples taken from humans. Overall, our results demonstrate that ephrin-B2 and Dll4 mediated co-dependence of HCC and EPC intercellular crosstalk in the initial stages of HCC establishment and development, a promising target for new clinical strategies.

Abstract: The subtypes of distant-organ metastasis led to treatment failure and poor prognosis are major obstacles in the management of patients with advanced breast cancer (BCa). Emerging evidences demonstrated that exosomes act as mediators for intercellular communication between various types of cells in the local tumor microenvironment. The present study aims to investigate whether BCa-derived exosomes are capable of cell-cell transferring miR-222 for BCa metastatic progression. Results showed that exosomal miR-222 is highly expressed in BCa patients with lymphatic metastasis. Consistently, the elevated levels of exosomal miR-222 are closely correlated with the high aggressivity of BCa cell lines. miR-222 promoting the aggressivity of BCa cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-222 directly targets PDLIM2, a tumor suppressor gene, leading to activation of NF-κB signal pathway. In conclusion, the levels of exosomal miR-222 are correlated with BCa metastatic progression. Exosome-transferred miR-222 promotes migration and invasion of BCa cells. miR-222 contributes to tumorigenicity of BCa cells through down-regulation of PDLIM2 and consequently activating NF-κB.

Abstract: The present study aimed to explore whether deregulated miR-138 is implicated in cerebral I/R injury-impaired learning and memory abilities. Rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid occlusion followed by reperfusion to induce cerebral I/R injury. A model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was conducted to mimic cerebral I/R conditions in vitro. MiR-138 expression levels were reduced in the hippocampus of cerebral I/R injured rats. Inhibition of miR-138 ameliorated the impaired learning and memory abilities of rats, and promoted autophagy and thus attenuated apoptosis in the OGD/R-treated hippocampal neurons. Moreover, miR-138 targets the 3′-UTR of SIRT1 and repressed its expression. These results showed that miR-138 could improve the learning and memory abilities via promoting autophagy under cerebral I/R injured conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Integration of stem cell-derived neurons into the central nervous system (CNS) remains a challenge. A co-culture system is developed to understand whether mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spiral ganglion neuron (SGN)-like cells (ESNs) synapse with native mouse cochlear nucleus (CN) neurons. A Cre system is used to generate Cop-GFP ESCs, which are induced into ESNs expressing features similar to auditory SGNs. Neural connections are observed between ESNs and CN neurons 4–6 days after co-culturing, which is stimulated by thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Antagonist and loss-of-function small hairpin RNA studies indicate that the α2δ1 receptor is critical for TSP1-induced synaptogenesis effects. Newly generated synapse-like structures express pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Synaptic vesicle recycling, pair recording, and blocker electrophysiology suggest functional synaptic vesicles, transsynaptic activities, and formation of glutamatergic synapses. These results demonstrate the synaptogenesis capability of ESNs, which is important for pluripotent ESC-derived neurons to form functional synaptic connections to CNS neurons.

Abstract: Chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs) strongly influences gene transcription and cell differentiation. However, a mechanistic understanding of the transcriptional control during the neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a promising cellular model for mental disorders, remains elusive. Here, we carried out additional analyses on our recently published open chromatin regions (OCRs) profiling at different stages of hiPSC neuronal differentiation. We found that the dynamic changes of OCR during neuronal differentiation highlighted cell stage-specific gene networks, and the chromatin accessibility at the core promoter region of a gene correlates with the corresponding transcript abundance. Within the cell stage-specific OCRs, we identified the binding of cell stage-specific TFs and observed a lag of a neuronal TF binding behind the mRNA expression of the corresponding TF. Interestingly, binding footprints of NEUROD1 and NEUROG2, both of which induce high efficient conversion of hiPSCs to glutamatergic neurons, were among those most enriched in the relatively mature neurons. Furthermore, TF network analysis showed that both NEUROD1 and NEUROG2 were present in the same core TF network specific to more mature neurons, suggesting a pivotal mechanism of epigenetic control of neuronal differentiation and maturation. Our study provides novel insights into the epigenetic control of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the context of TF networks, which may be instrumental to improving hiPSC modeling of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, one of the leading health problems in the world, is defined as a cause of cardiomyocytes death. In the present study, we investigate the role of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling of I/R injury rats and the underlying mechanism involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The important differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in I/R injury were screened out and downstream pathways affected by DEGs were predicted. We grouped 90 rats into sham, I/R, NC siRNA, FRP1 siRNA, empty vector, and FRP1 vector groups and established a model of I/R injury in rats. CVF value, myocardial infarct areas and positive expression rate of FPR1 and MAPK were detected. Levels of FPR1 and MAPK pathway-related genes were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell proliferation and flow cytometry to evaluate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. GSE19804 and GSE27262 were screened from Gene Expression Omnibus database. FPR1 was higher in patients with I/R injury and activate the MAPK signaling pathway. FRP1 gene silencing decreased CVF value, infarct area, apoptotic index, positive expression rates of FPR1 and MAPK, decreased FPR1, p38, ERK, JNK, MMP-2, TIMP-2, NF-kB, Bax, p-p38, p-ERK, and p-JNK levels, increased Bcl-2 level, promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and inhibited cell apoptosis rate. Overall, our study demonstrates that the silencing of FPR1 gene depresses inflammation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling in rats with I/R injury through the suppressing the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a role in the maintenance of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. We asked whether TGF-β1 controls the cell cycle status of HSCs in vitro to enhance the reconstitution activity. To examine the effect of TGF-β1 on the HSC function, we used an in vitro culture system in which single HSCs divide with the retention of their short- and long-term reconstitution ability. Extensive single-cell analyses showed that, regardless of its concentration, TGF-β1 slowed down the cell cycle progression of HSCs but consequently suppressed their self-renewal potential. Cycling HSCs were not able to go back to quiescence with TGF-β1. This study revealed a negative role of TGF-β1 in the regulation of the HSC number and reconstitution activity.

Abstract: MiR-182–5p suppresses expression of Foxo1 that is a protective factor in renal disorders and is up-regulated in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Thus, we hypothesized that dys-function of miR-182–5p/Foxo1 axis contributed to development of lupus nephritis (LN). Firstly, we investigated the expressions of miR-182–5p and Foxo1 in LN patients and during growth of LN MRL/lpr mice. Then we subjected MRL/lpr mice to the injection of miR-182–5p antagomirs and assessed the effect of miR-182–5p inhibition on renal structure and function. In vitro, we administrated renal cell lines with TGF-β1 to explore the relation between renal fibrosis and miR-182–5p. The level of miR-182–5p was up-regulated in high Chronicity Index patients while the level of Foxo1 was suppressed. The progression of LN in mice was associated with the increased level of miR-182–5p and the decreased level of Foxo1. The inhibition of miR-182–5p ameliorated renal structure and function impairments associated with LN, along with the increased expression of Foxo1. The administration of TGF-β1 in vitro increased the expression of miR-182–5p in renal cells in an overall dose-dependent manner. The current study demonstrated that the expression of miR-182–5p was increased in LN patients, contributing to the suppression of Foxo1 and development of LN.

Abstract: Summary
The emerging arthropod-borne flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with neurological complications. Innate immunity is essential for the control of virus infection, but the innate immune mechanisms that impact viral infection of neurons remain poorly defined. Using the genetically tractable Drosophila system, we show that ZIKV infection of the adult fly brain leads to NF-kB-dependent inflammatory signaling, which serves to limit infection. ZIKV-dependent NF-kB activation induces the expression of Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes (dSTING) in the brain. dSTING protects against ZIKV by inducing autophagy in the brain. Loss of autophagy leads to increased ZIKV infection of the brain and death of the infected fly, while pharmacological activation of autophagy is protective. These data suggest an essential role for an inflammation-dependent STING pathway in the control of neuronal infection and a conserved role for STING in antimicrobial autophagy, which may represent an ancestral function for this essential innate immune sensor.

Abstract: Monocyte migration into diseased tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases. Intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa3.1) channels play an important role in cell migration. However, the role of KCa3.1 channels in mediating monocyte migration induced by palmitic acid (PA) is still unclear. Using cultured THP-1 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects, we investigated the role and signaling mechanisms of KCa3.1 channels in mediating the migration induced by PA. Using methods of Western blotting analysis, RNA interference, cell migration assay and ELISA, we found that PA-treated monocytes exhibited increment of the protein levels of KCa3.1 channel and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the effects were reversed by co-incubation of PA with anti-TLR2/4 antibodies or by specific inhibitors of p38-MAPK, or NF-κB. In addition, PA increased monocyte migration, which was abolished by a specific KCa3.1 channel blocker, TRAM-34, or KCa3.1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The expression and secretion of MCP-1 induced by PA was also similarly prevented by TRAM-34 and KCa3.1 siRNA. These results demonstrate for the first time that PA upregulates KCa3.1 channels through TLR2/4, p38-MAPK and NF-κB pathway to promote the expression of MCP-1, and then induce the trans-endothelial migration of monocytes.

Abstract: Cell actin cytoskeleton is primarily modulated by Rho family proteins. RhoA regulates several downstream targets, including Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), LIM-Kinase (LIMK), and cofilin. Pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRP4) modulates the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells via RhoA activity inhibition. In this study, we discovered that PRP4 over-expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells induces cofilin dephosphorylation by inhibiting the Rho-ROCK-LIMK-cofilin pathway. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis indicated increased expression of protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) in PRP4-transfected HCT116 cells. The presence of PRP4 increased the expression of PP1A both at the mRNA and protein levels, which possibly activated cofilin through dephosphorylation and subsequently modulated the cell actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we found that PRP4 over-expression did not induce cofilin dephosphorylation in the presence of okadaic acid, a potent phosphatase inhibitor. Moreover, we discovered that PRP4 over-expression in HCT116 cells induced dephosphorylation of migration and invasion inhibitory protein (MIIP), and down-regulation of E-cadherin protein levels, which were further restored by the presence of okadaic acid. These findings indicate a possible molecular mechanism of PRP4-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and make PRP4 an important target in colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The derivation of microglia from human stem cells provides systems for understanding microglial biology and enables functional studies of disease-causing mutations. We describe a robust method for the derivation of human microglia from stem cells, which are phenotypically and functionally comparable with primary microglia. We used stem cell-derived microglia to study the consequences of missense mutations in the microglial-expressed protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which are causal for frontotemporal dementia-like syndrome and Nasu-Hakola disease. We find that mutant TREM2 accumulates in its immature form, does not undergo typical proteolysis, and is not trafficked to the plasma membrane. However, in the absence of plasma membrane TREM2, microglia differentiate normally, respond to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and are phagocytically competent. These data indicate that dementia-associated TREM2 mutations have subtle effects on microglia biology, consistent with the adult onset of disease in individuals with these mutations.

Abstract: Induction of cellular senescence represents a novel strategy to inhibit aberrant proliferation of cancer cells. Resveratrol is gaining attention for its cancer preventive and suppressive properties. Tumor suppressor gene DLC1 is shown to induce apoptosis, suppress migration and invasion in various cancer cells. However, the function of DLC1 in cancer cellular senescence is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the biological role of DLC1 in resveratrol induced cancer cellular senescence. Our results showed that resveratrol inhibited proliferation of cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and H1299) and induced senescence along with increase of SA-β-gal activity and regulation of senescence-associated molecular markers p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, p27, p21, Rb and p-Rb protein. The underlying mechanism was that resveratrol induced mitochondrial dysfunction with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of MT-ND1, MT-ND6 and ATPase8 in transcript level and down-regulation of PGC-1α in protein level to result in ROS production. With ROS elevation, resveratrol decreased DNMT1 and increased DLC1 expression significantly. However, after ROS scavenger NAC was added to the cancer cells treated by resveratrol, DNMT1, DLC1 and senescence-associated molecular markers were reversed. This reveals that resveratrol induced cancer cellular senescence through DLC1 in a ROS-dependent manner. Silencing DLC1 markedly attenuated SA-β-gal activity and p38MAPK, p27 and p21 protein levels, and increased Rb expression, indicating that resveratrol promoted senescence via targeting DLC1. Moreover, DLC1 promoted senescence through FoxO3a/NF-κB signaling mediated by SIRT1 after resveratrol treatment. Finally, resveratrol increased ROS production to induce DNA damage with p-CHK1 up-regulation and result in cancer cellular senescence. This is the first time to investigate resveratrol induced cancer cellular senescence by primarily targeting DLC1. Induction of cellular senescence by resveratrol may represent a novel anticancer mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Increased protein citrullination is linked to various diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus, and cancer. Citrullinated autoantigens, a hallmark of RA, are recognized by anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) which are used to diagnose RA. ACPA-recognizing citrullinated enolase, vimentin, keratin, and filaggrin are also pathogenic. Here, we used a chemoproteomic approach to define the RA-associated citrullinome. The identified proteins include numerous serine protease inhibitors (Serpins), proteases and metabolic enzymes. We demonstrate that citrullination of antiplasmin, antithrombin, t-PAI, and C1 inhibitor (P1-Arg-containing Serpins) abolishes their ability to inhibit their cognate proteases. Citrullination of nicotinamide N-methyl transferase (NNMT) also abolished its methyltransferase activity. Overall, these data advance our understanding of the roles of citrullination in RA and suggest that extracellular protein arginine deiminase (PAD) activity can modulate protease activity with consequent effects on Serpin-regulated pathways. Moreover, our data suggest that inhibition of extracellular PAD activity will be therapeutically relevant.

Abstract: Myocardial hypoxia-induced endothelial cell apoptosis contributes to cardiac dysfunction, such as myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial ischemia, and heart failure. Thus, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) during exposure to hypoxia. SP-1 is an important regulator of cytokines associated with cell functions. We found that SP-1 expression increased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to hypoxia by western blot. Then the SP-1 siRNA was transfected into HUVECs under hypoxic condition. MTT assay showed that hypoxia reduced the cell proliferation, but SP-1 siRNA reversed that. Transfection with si-SP-1 also reversed cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increased by hypoxia treatment. Moreover, inflammatory phenotype were increased in hypoxia induced HUVECs, including ICAM-1,VCAM-1 levels as well as TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β secretion, and the si-SP-1 also reversed this effect of hypoxia. Additionally, si-SP-1 increased expression of miR-135b and reduced expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), which is the target gene of miR-135b. To investigate the underlying mechanism of SP-1 on hypoxia induced HUVECs injury, the anti-miR-135b or HIF-1α agonist (CoCl2) were used. Finally, the result indicated that both anti-miR-135b or CoCl2 treatment reversed the effects of SP-1 siRNA under hypoxia. In conclusion, the SP-1/miR-135b/HIF-1α axis may play a critical role in hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial injury. Our study thus provides novel insights into the role of this transcription factor and miRNAs in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced cardiac dysfunctions.

Abstract: αB-Crystallin (HSPB5) is a small heat-shock protein that is composed of dimers that then assemble into a polydisperse ensemble of oligomers. Oligomerisation is mediated by heterologous interactions between the C-terminal tail of one dimer and the core “α-crystallin” domain of another and stabilised by interactions made by the N-terminal region. Comparatively little is known about the latter contribution, but previous studies have suggested that residues in the region 54–60 form contacts that stabilise the assembly. We have generated mutations in this region (P58A, S59A, S59K, R56S/S59R and an inversion of residues 54–60) to examine their impact on oligomerisation and chaperone activity in vitro. By using native mass spectrometry, we found that all the αB-crystallin mutants were assembly competent, populating similar oligomeric distributions to wild-type, ranging from 16-mers to 30-mers. However, circular dichroism spectroscopy, intrinsic tryptophan and bis-ANS fluorescence studies demonstrated that the secondary structure differs to wild type, the 54–60 inversion mutation having the greatest impact. All the mutants exhibited a dramatic decrease in exposed hydrophobicity. We also found that the mutants in general were equally active as the wild-type protein in inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of insulin and seeded amyloid fibrillation of α-synuclein in vitro, except for the 54–60 inversion mutant, which was significantly less effective at inhibiting insulin aggregation. Our data indicate that alterations in the part of the N-terminal region proximal to the core domain do not drastically affect the oligomerisation of αB-crystallin, reinforcing the robustness of αB-crystallin in functioning as a molecular chaperone.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common female malignant tumors in the world. It seriously affects women's physical and mental health and the leading cause of cancer death among women. Our previous study demonstrated that diet-derived IFN-γ promoted the malignant transformation of primary bovine mammary epithelial cells by accelerating arginine depletion. The current study aimed to explore whether arginine addition could inhibit the degree of malignant transformation and its molecular mechanism. The results indicate that arginine addition could alleviate the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ, including reducing cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation, through the NF-κB-GCN2/eIF2α pathway. The in vivo experiments also consistently confirmed that arginine supplementation could significantly inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, the investigation of the clinical data also revealed that the plasma or tissue from human breast cancer patients owned lower arginine level and higher IFN-γ level than that from patients with benign breast disease, showing IFN-γ may be a potential control target. Our findings demonstrate that arginine supplement could antagonize the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ (nutritionally induced) both in vitro and in vivo, and IFN-γ was higher in breast cancer women. This might provide a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer regarding to nutrition.

Abstract: Summary
The capacity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to differentiate into all lineages of mature organism is precisely regulated by cellular signaling factors. STAT3 is a crucial transcription factor that plays a central role in maintaining ESC identity. However, the underlying mechanism by which STAT3 directs differentiation is still not completely understood. Here, we show that STAT3 positively regulates gene expression of methyltransferase-like protein 8 (Mettl8) in mouse ESCs. We found that METTL8 is dispensable for pluripotency but affects ESC differentiation. Subsequently, we discovered that METTL8 interacts with Mapkbp1's mRNA, which is an intermediate factor in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, and inhibits the translation of the mRNA. Thereby, METTL8 prohibits the activation of JNK signaling and enhances the differentiation of mouse ESCs. Collectively, our study uncovers a STAT3 target, Mettl8, which regulates mouse ESC differentiation via JNK signaling.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T helper (Th) cell activation is essential for inducing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against malignancy. We reprogrammed a Th clone specific for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-derived b3a2 peptide to pluripotency and re-differentiated the cells into original TCR-expressing T-lineage cells (iPS-T cells) with gene expression patterns resembling those of group 1 innate lymphoid cells. CD4 gene transduction into iPS-T cells enhanced b3a2 peptide-specific responses via b3a2 peptide-specific TCR. iPS-T cells upregulated CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression in response to interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. In the presence of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptide, antigen-specific dendritic cells (DCs) conditioned by CD4-modified CD40Lhigh iPS-T cells stimulated WT1-specific CTL priming, which eliminated WT1 peptide-expressing CML cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CD4 modification of CD40Lhigh iPS-T cells generates innate lymphoid helper-like cells inducing bcr-abl-specific TCR signaling that mediates effectiveanti-leukemic CTL responses via DC maturation, showing potential for adjuvant immunotherapy against leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms have been evaluated for their ability to discriminate between VEGFR2 and NRP1 in real-time ligand binding studies in live cells using BRET. To enable this, we synthesized single-site (N-terminal cysteine) labeled versions of VEGF165a, VEGF165b, and VEGF121a. These were used in combination with N-terminal NanoLuc-tagged VEGFR2 or NRP1 to evaluate the selectivity of VEGF isoforms for these two membrane proteins. All fluorescent VEGF-A isoforms displayed high affinity for VEGFR2. Only VEGF165a-TMR bound to NanoLuc-NRP1 with a similar high affinity (4.4 nM). Competition NRP1 binding experiments yielded a rank order of potency of VEGF165a > VEGF189a > VEGF145a. VEGF165b, VEGF-Ax, VEGF121a, and VEGF111a were unable to bind to NRP1. There were marked differences in the kinetic binding profiles of VEGF165a-TMR for NRP1 and VEGFR2. These data emphasize the importance of the kinetic aspects of ligand binding to VEGFR2 and its co-receptors in the dynamics of VEGF signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) derive energy predominantly from glycolysis and not the energy-efficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Differentiation is initiated with energy metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS. We investigated the role of mitochondrial energy metabolism in human PSCs using molecular, biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches. We show that the carcinoma protein OCIAD1 interacts with and regulates mitochondrial complex I activity. Energy metabolic assays on live pluripotent cells showed that OCIAD1-depleted cells have increased OXPHOS and may be poised for differentiation. OCIAD1 maintains human embryonic stem cells, and its depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout leads to rapid and increased differentiation upon induction, whereas OCIAD1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Pharmacological alteration of complex I activity was able to rescue the defects of OCIAD1 modulation. Thus, hPSCs can exist in energy metabolic substates. OCIAD1 provides a target to screen for additional modulators of mitochondrial activity to promote transient multipotent precursor expansion or enhance differentiation.

Abstract: An essential aspect of stem cell in vitro culture and in vivo therapy is achieving sustained levels of growth factors to support stem cell survival and expansion, while maintaining their multipotency and differentiation potential. This study investigated the ability of dextrin (~74,000 g/mol; 27.8 mol% succinoylation) conjugated to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; or FGF-2) (3.9 and 6.7% w/w protein loading, respectively) to support the expansion and differentiation of stem cells in vitro via sustained, controllable growth factor release. Supplementation of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) with dextrin-growth factor conjugates led to greater and prolonged proliferation compared to unbound EGF/bFGF controls, with no detectable apoptosis after 7 days of treatment. Immunocytochemical detection of neural precursor (nestin) and differentiation (Olig2, MAP2, GFAP) markers verified that controlled release of dextrin-conjugated growth factors preserves stem cell properties of mNSCs for up to 7 days. These results show the potential of dextrin-growth factor conjugates for localized delivery of bioactive therapeutic agents to support stem cell expansion and differentiation, and as an adjunct to direct neuronal repair.

Abstract: Summary
Acyldepsipeptides (ADEPs) are potential antibiotics that dysregulate the activity of the highly conserved tetradecameric bacterial ClpP protease, leading to bacterial cell death. Here, we identified ADEP analogs that are potent dysregulators of the human mitochondrial ClpP (HsClpP). These ADEPs interact tightly with HsClpP, causing the protease to non-specifically degrade model substrates. Dysregulation of HsClpP activity by ADEP was found to induce cytotoxic effects via activation of the intrinsic, caspase-dependent apoptosis. ADEP-HsClpP co-crystal structure was solved for one of the analogs revealing a highly complementary binding interface formed by two HsClpP neighboring subunits but, unexpectedly, with HsClpP in the compact conformation. Given that HsClpP is highly expressed in multiple cancers and has important roles in cell metastasis, our findings suggest a therapeutic potential for ADEPs in cancer treatment.

Abstract: SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes, including the human BAF and PBAF complexes, are involved in controlling stem cell pluripotency and differentiation in many species. However, these complexes have not been fully characterized in planarians, an emerging model for the in vivo study of stem cells. These flatworms have the ability to regenerate following injury or amputation, and we sought to investigate the role of chromatin remodeling in this process through bioinformatic and genetic characterization of the SWI/SNF-like complexes in Schmidtea mediterranea. We identified planarian homologs of all human BAF and PBAF subunits, and then examined their expression patterns and RNAi phenotypes. We found that the genes are expressed in both stem cells and differentiated tissues, and their knockdown results in impaired regeneration and other phenotypes indicating stem cell dysfunction. Knockdown of core complex members and Smed-ARID1 led to an increase in steady-state mitotic cell number, however, the stereotypical proliferative response that follows amputation was reduced following Smed-BRG1/BRM-2 RNAi. The number of differentiating epidermal lineage cells and expression of epidermal and muscle lineage markers were also reduced following SWI/SNF knockdown. Our findings provide insight into the importance of the SWI/SNF complex in stem cell function and cellular differentiation in planarians.

Abstract: The fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster harbours different types of ciliary structures: ciliary projections associated with neurons of type I and cilium-like regions (CLRs) found during male gametogenesis. The latter deserve particular attention since they are morphologically similar to vertebrate primary cilia and transform into the sperm axonemes during spermiogenesis. Although, all the centrioles are able to organize the CLRs, we found that the mother centriole docks first to the plasma membrane suggesting a new intrinsic functional asymmetry between the parent centrioles. We also show that the CLRs lack the Y-links that connect the axoneme doublets with the plasma membrane in conventional primary cilia. Moreover, the C-tubules, that are lacking in the axoneme of the primary cilia, persisted along the CLRs albeit modified into longitudinal blades. Remarkably, mutant flies in which the CLRs are devoid of the C-tubules or their number is reduced lack sperm axonemes or have incomplete axonemes. Therefore, the C-tubules are dispensable for the assembly of the CLRs but are essential for sperm axoneme elongation and maintenance in Drosophila.

Abstract: Chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) is a molecular chaperone consisting of eight distinct protein subunits, that when oligomeric is essential for the folding of newly synthesized tubulin and actin. In addition to folding, CCT activity includes functions of individual subunits in their monomeric form. For example, when CCTδ monomer levels are increased in cultured mammalian cells, numerous cell surface protrusions are formed from retraction fibres, indicating that an underlying function for the CCTδ monomer exists. Here, using a yeast two-hybrid screen we identify the dynactin complex component p150Glued as a binding partner for CCTδ and show by siRNA depletion that this interaction is required for the formation of CCTδ-induced cell surface protrusions. Intact microtubules are necessary for the formation of the protrusions, consistent with microtubule minus end transport driving the retraction fibre formation and depletion of either p150Glued or the dynactin complex-associated transmembrane protein dynAP prevents the previously observed localization of GFP-CCTδ to the plasma membrane. Wound healing assays reveal that CCTδ monomer levels influence directional cell migration and together our observations demonstrate that in addition to the folding activity of CCT in its oligomer form, a monomeric subunit is associated with events that involve the assembled cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem and precursor cell (NSPC) proliferation in the rodent adult hippocampus is essential to maintain stem cell populations and produce new neurons. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is implicated in regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but its exact role in control of NSPC behavior has not been examined. We show RA signaling in all hippocampal NSPC subtypes and that inhibition of RA synthesis or signaling significantly decreases NSPC proliferation via abrogation of cell-cycle kinetics and cell-cycle regulators. RA signaling controls NSPC proliferation through hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α), where stabilization of HIF1α concurrent with disruption of RA signaling can prevent NSPC defects. These studies demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for RA signaling in hippocampal NSPCs that substantially broadens RA's function beyond its well-described role in neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1) and FFA4 mediate a variety of biological responses through binding of medium- and long-chain free fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate an involvement of FFA1 and FFA4 in the regulation of cellular functions during tumor progression in colon cancer cells. The long-term fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) treated cells were generated from DLD1 cells (DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells, respectively). FFAR1 expressions were lower in DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells than in DLD1 cells. In contrast, DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells showed the high FFAR4 expressions, compared with DLD1 cells. The cell motile activities of DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells were reduced by GW9508 which is an agonist of FFA1 and FFA4. Moreover, GW1100, an antagonist of FFA1, inhibited the cell motile activities of DLD-5FU and DLD-CDDP cells. To evaluate whether FFA1 and FFA4 regulate the enhancement of cell motility, invasion and colony formation, highly migratory (hmDLD1) cells were established from DLD1 cells. FFAR1 expression was significantly higher in hmDLD1 cells than in DLD1 cells, but no change of FFAR4 expression was observed. The elevated cell motile and invasive activities and colony formation of hmDLD1 cells were suppressed by FFA1 inhibition. These results suggest that FFA1 and FFA4 are involved in the regulation of cellular functions during tumor progression in colon cancer DLD1 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Secretory proteins translocate across the mammalian ER membrane co-translationally via the ribosome-sec61 translocation machinery. Signal sequences within the polypeptide, which guide this event, are diverse in their hydrophobicity, charge, length, and amino acid composition. Despite the known sequence diversity in the ER signals, it is generally assumed that they have a dominant role in determining co-translational targeting and translocation process. We have analyzed co-translational events experienced by secretory proteins carrying efficient versus inefficient signal sequencing, using an assay based on Xbp1 peptide-mediated translational arrest. With this method we were able to measure the functional efficiency of ER signal sequences. We show that an efficient signal sequence experiences a two-phase event whereby the nascent chain is pulled from the ribosome during its translocation, thus resuming translation and yielding full-length products. Conversely, the inefficient signal sequence experiences a single weaker pulling event, suggesting inadequate engagement by the translocation machinery of these marginally hydrophobic signal sequences.

Abstract: The tumor starvation microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the malignant progression of cancer, which is closely related to autophagy, glycolysis, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of the starvation-mediated malignant phenotype are still not well documented. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of starvation on glycolysis, autophagy, and EMT in OSCC and to further elucidate the key metabolic modulator. The results showed that starvation can induce autophagy, EMT, and enhanced glycolysis in OSCC cells. We determined that the expression of the key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-platelet (PFKP) obviously increased under starvation conditions and that PFKP knockdown inhibited starvation-mediated glycolysis, autophagy and EMT in OSCC cells. Moreover, we confirmed that PFKP knockdown inhibited OSCC xenograft growth in vivo. In addition, PFKP expression was significantly increased in OSCC patients and its upregulation was associated with the presence of tumor pathological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PFKP is necessary for starvation-mediated autophagy, glycolysis, and EMT, thereby promoting the malignant progression of OSCC.

Abstract: The conservation of endangered fish is an urgent issue. Although cryo-banking of fish gametes might ultimately help conserve endangered fish, cryopreservation of fish eggs or embryos is still not possible due to their large size and high yolk content. Therefore, as an alternative, we focused on undifferentiated germ cells, such as primordial germ cells, spermatogonia, and oogonia, as materials for cryopreservation. Transplantation of cryopreserved germ cells into the body cavity of allogeneic or xenogeneic recipients sterilized by triploidization or endogenous germ cell ablation resulted in migration of the transplanted germ cells toward the recipient genital ridges, where they were eventually incorporated. The donor-derived germ cells initiated either spermatogenesis or oogenesis in the recipient gonads, depending on the sex of the recipient. Furthermore, by mating the male and female recipients, viable offspring derived from the frozen germ cells were produced. Although this technology was established using salmonid fish, we found that it is applicable to a wide range of fish species. Thus, this method might represent a “silver bullet” for preserving the valuable genetic resources of endangered fish species.

Abstract: Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a tumor suppressor is recently recognized to play an important role in many human solid tumors. However, the biological significance and function of AIM2 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain unknown. In this study, we proposed to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of AIM2 in RCC patient specimens, to analyze the correlation between AIM2 expression and disease progression, and to further investigate the role and mechanism of AIM2 in malignant behaviors of renal carcinoma by cellular and animal models. The correlation analysis showed that low AIM2 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, poor 5-year overall (P < 0.05) and disease-specific survival (P < 0.05) in RCC patients. Over-expression of AIM2 in 786-O or OSRC-2 cells suppressed the cell proliferation, migration and invasion as compared with control. The increased AIM2 expression enhanced the expression of autophagy-related genes (Bcl-2, Beclin-1, LC3-Ⅱ, and ATG-5) and increased the ratio of LC3-Ⅱ/LC3-Ⅰin renal carcinoma cells. Of note, the blockade of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) abrogated the inhibition of cell migration and invasion by over-expressing AIM2, indicated that AIM2 suppressed the malignant behaviors of renal carcinoma by enhancing the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, 3-MA abolished the prevention of tumor growth on nude mouse established by AIM2-OSRC-2 cells. Our results suggested that AIM2 might serve as a novel prognostic indicator as well as a potential therapeutic target for renal carcinoma treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Thyroid hormone (TH) transporters are required for the transmembrane passage of TH in target cells. In humans, inactivating mutations in the TH transporter MCT8 cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, characterized by severe neuromuscular symptoms and an abnormal TH serum profile, which is fully replicated in Mct8 knockout mice and Mct8/Oatp1c1 double-knockout (M/O DKO) mice. Analysis of tissue TH content and expression of TH-regulated genes indicate a thyrotoxic state in Mct8-deficient skeletal muscles. Both TH transporters are upregulated in activated satellite cells (SCs). In M/O DKO mice, we observed a strongly reduced number of differentiated SCs, suggesting an impaired stem cell function. Moreover, M/O DKO mice and mice lacking both transporters exclusively in SCs showed impaired skeletal muscle regeneration. Our data provide solid evidence for a unique gate-keeper function of MCT8 and OATP1C1 in SC activation, underscoring the importance of a finely tuned TH signaling during myogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Bone, cartilage, and marrow adipocytes are generated by skeletal progenitors, but the relationships between lineages and mechanisms controlling their differentiation are poorly understood. We established mouse clonal skeletal progenitors with distinct differentiation properties and analyzed their transcriptome. Unipotent osteogenic and adipogenic cells expressed specific transcriptional programs, whereas bipotent clones combined expression of those genes and did not show a unique signature. We tested potential regulators of lineage commitment and found that in the presence of interferon-γ (IFNγ) adipogenic clones can be induced to osteogenesis and that their adipogenic capacity is inhibited. Analysis of IFNγ-regulated genes showed that lineage signatures and fate commitment of skeletal progenitors were controlled by EGR1 and EGR2. Knockdown experiments revealed that EGR1 is a positive regulator of the adipogenic transcriptional program and differentiation capacity, whereas EGR2 inhibits the osteogenic program and potency. Therefore, our work revealed transcriptional signatures of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages and mechanism triggering cell fate.

Abstract: One of the major challenges in Glioblastoma (GBM) therapy relates with the existence of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), known to be chemo- and radio-resistant. GSCs and non-stem GBM cells have the ability to interchange, emphasizing the importance of identifying common molecular targets among those cell sub-populations. Nucleolin overexpression has been recently associated with breast cancer sub-populations with different stem-like phenotype. The goal of this work was to evaluate the potential of cell surface nucleolin as a target in GBM cells. Different levels of nucleolin expression resulted in a 3.4-fold higher association of liposomes targeting nucleolin (functionalized with the nucleolin-binding F3 peptide) in U87, relative to GBM11 glioblastoma cells. Moreover, nucleolin was suggested as a potential marker in OCT4-, NANOG-positive GSC, and in the corresponding non-stem GBM cells, as well as in SOX2-positive GSC. Doxorubicin delivered by liposomes targeting nucleolin enabled a level of cytotoxicity that was 2.5- or 4.6-fold higher compared to the non-targeted counterparts. Importantly, an overexpression of nucleolin was also observed in cells of patient-derived samples, as compared with normal brain. Overall, these results suggested nucleolin as a therapeutic target in GBM.

Abstract: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a hereditary form of diabetes mellitus presenting at childhood or adolescence, which eventually leads to pancreatic β-cells dysfunction. The underlying genetic basis of MODY disorders is haploinsufficiency, where loss-of-function mutations in a single allele cause the diabetic phenotype in heterozygous patients. MODY1 is a type of MODY disorder resulting from a mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α). In order to establish a human based model to study MODY1, we generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Differentiation of these pluripotent cells towards the pancreatic lineage enabled to evaluate the effects of the MODY1 mutation and its impact on endodermal and pancreatic cells. Analyzing the gene expression profiles of differentiated MODY1 cells, revealed the outcome of HNF4α haploinsufficiency on its targets. This molecular analysis suggests that the differential expression of HNF4α target genes in MODY1 is affected by the number of HNF4α binding sites, their distance from the transcription start site, and the number of other transcription factor binding sites. These features may help explain the molecular manifestations of haploinsufficiency in MODY1 disease.

Abstract: Viral myocarditis, which is caused by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection, is a leading reason of sudden cardiac death in young adults. Progranulin (PGRN), a pleiotropic growth factor, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory function in a variety of inflammatory diseases. However, the expression and function of PGRN in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that PGRN levels in plasma and cardiac tissues were significantly upregulated post CVB3 infection, and negative correlated with disease severity. PGRN deficiency significantly exacerbated, whereas recombinant PGRN treatment attenuated CVB3-induced myocarditis in mice. PGRN downregulated Th1 and Th17 cell responses and cytokine production in vitro and in vivo, whereas its effect on viral myocarditis was Treg cell independent. Furthermore, PGRN regulated Th1 and Th17 cells differentiation through inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway. Therefore, our findings reveal a critical role for PGRN in reducing CVB3-induced myocarditis and suggest that PGRN maybe a novel therapeutic treatment for viral myocarditis.

Abstract: Cell-mediated gene therapy is a possible means to treat muscular dystrophies like Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Autologous patient stem cells can be genetically-corrected and transplanted back into the patient, without causing immunorejection problems. Regenerated muscle fibres derived from these cells will express the missing dystrophin protein, thus improving muscle function. CD133+ cells derived from normal human skeletal muscle contribute to regenerated muscle fibres and form muscle stem cells after their intra-muscular transplantation into an immunodeficient mouse model. But it is not known whether CD133+ cells derived from DMD patient muscles have compromised muscle regenerative function. To test this, we compared CD133+ cells derived from DMD and normal human muscles. DMD CD133+ cells had a reduced capacity to undergo myogenic differentiation in vitro compared with CD133+ cells derived from normal muscle. In contrast to CD133+ cells derived from normal human muscle, those derived from DMD muscle formed no satellite cells and gave rise to significantly fewer muscle fibres of donor origin, after their intra-muscular transplantation into an immunodeficient, non-dystrophic, mouse muscle. DMD CD133+ cells gave rise to more clones of smaller size and more clones that were less myogenic than did CD133+ cells derived from normal muscle. The heterogeneity of the progeny of CD133+ cells, combined with the reduced proliferation and myogenicity of DMD compared to normal CD133+ cells, may explain the reduced regenerative capacity of DMD CD133+ cells.

Abstract: Summary
Connecting specific cancer genotypes with phenotypes and drug responses constitutes the central premise of precision oncology but is hindered by the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of primary cancer cells. Here, we use patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to dissect the individual contributions of two recurrent genetic lesions, the splicing factor SRSF2 P95L mutation and the chromosome 7q deletion, to the development of myeloid malignancy. Using a comprehensive panel of isogenic iPSCs—with none, one, or both genetic lesions—we characterize their relative phenotypic contributions and identify drug sensitivities specific to each one through a candidate drug approach and an unbiased large-scale small-molecule screen. To facilitate drug testing and discovery, we also derive SRSF2-mutant and isogenic normal expandable hematopoietic progenitor cells. We thus describe here an approach to dissect the individual effects of two cooperating mutations to clinically relevant features of malignant diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) can be caused by insulin mutations. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts of a patient with PNDM and undetectable insulin at birth due to a homozygous mutation in the translation start site of the insulin gene. Differentiation of mutant cells resulted in insulin-negative endocrine stem cells expressing MAFA, NKX6.1, and chromogranin A. Correction of the mutation in stem cells and differentiation to pancreatic endocrine cells restored insulin production and insulin secretion to levels comparable to those of wild-type cells. Grafting of corrected cells into mice, followed by ablating mouse β cells using streptozotocin, resulted in normal glucose homeostasis, including at night, and the stem cell-derived grafts adapted insulin secretion to metabolic changes. Our study provides proof of principle for the generation of genetically corrected cells autologous to a patient with non-autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes. These cases should be readily amenable to autologous cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Superoxide radical anion (O2⋅‒) and other reactive oxygen species are constantly produced during respiration. In mitochondria, the dismutation of O2⋅‒ is accelerated by the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), an enzyme that has been traditionally associated with antioxidant protection. However, increases in SOD2 expression promote oxidative stress, indicating that there may be a prooxidant role for SOD2. Here we show that SOD2, which normally binds manganese, can incorporate iron and generate an alternative isoform with peroxidase activity. The switch from manganese to iron allows FeSOD2 to utilize H2O2 to promote oxidative stress. We found that FeSOD2 is formed in cultured cells and in vivo. FeSOD2 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and higher levels of oxidative stress in cultured cells and in vivo. We show that formation of FeSOD2 converts an antioxidant defense into a prooxidant peroxidase that leads to cellular changes seen in multiple human diseases.

Abstract: Regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitous protein that responds to various cell stresses. Studies have proved REDD1 is involved in many diseases, such as osteoarthritis and cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of REDD1 in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Analysis of clinical tissue samples showed REDD1 expression was up-regulated during IDD and was correlated with the grade of disc degeneration. Overexpression of REDD1 in normal human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells resulted in extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration. Further, we investigated the function of REDD1 using a serum deprivation-induced IDD vitro model and found that REDD1 was up-regulated in a temporal manner. However, hypoxia abolished this increase through down-regulation of NF-κB. Knockdown of REDD1 or NF-κB by si-RNA significantly rescued ECM from degeneration both in normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, NF-κB/REDD1 mediated the protection of hypoxia from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and autophagy in NP cells. These results suggest that REDD1 might play a pivotal role in IDD pathogenesis, thereby potentially providing a new therapeutic target for IDD treatment.

Sustained vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility promotes hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The etiology of hypercontractility is not completely understood. New therapeutic targets remain vitally important for drug discovery. Here we report that Pim kinases, in combination with DAPK3, regulate contractility and control hypertension. Using a co-crystal structure of lead molecule (HS38) in complex with DAPK3, a dual Pim/DAPK3 inhibitor (HS56) and selective DAPK3 inhibitors (HS94 and HS148) were developed to provide mechanistic insight into the polypharmacology of hypertension. In vitro and ex vivo studies indicated that Pim kinases directly phosphorylate smooth muscle targets and that Pim/DAPK3 inhibition, unlike selective DAPK3 inhibition, significantly reduces contractility. In vivo, HS56 decreased blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive mice in a dose-dependent manner without affecting heart rate. These findings suggest including Pim kinase inhibition within a multi-target engagement strategy for hypertension management. HS56 represents a significant step in the development of molecularly targeted antihypertensive medications.

Abstract: Summary
Centrioles account for centrosomes and cilia formation. Recently, a link between centrosomal components and human developmental disorders has been established. However, the exact mechanisms how centrosome abnormalities influence embryogenesis and cell fate are not understood. PLK4-STIL module represents a key element of centrosome duplication cycle. We analyzed consequences of inactivation of the module for early events of embryogenesis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We demonstrate that blocking of PLK4 or STIL functions leads to centrosome loss followed by both p53-dependent and -independent defects, including prolonged cell divisions, upregulation of p53, chromosome instability, and, importantly, reduction of pluripotency markers and induction of differentiation. We show that the observed loss of key stem cells properties is connected to alterations in mitotic timing and protein turnover. In sum, our data define a link between centrosome, its regulators, and the control of pluripotency and differentiation in PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The polo kinase family are important oncology targets that act in regulating entry into and progression through mitosis. Structure-guided discovery of a new class of inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) catalytic activity that interact with Cys67 of the ATP binding site is described. Compounds containing the benzothiazole N-oxide scaffold not only bind covalently to this residue, but are reversible inhibitors through the formation of Meisenheimer complexes. This mechanism of kinase inhibition results in compounds that can target PLK1 with high selectivity, while avoiding issues with irreversible covalent binding and interaction with other thiol-containing molecules in the cell. Due to renewed interest in covalent drugs and the plethora of potential drug targets, these represent prototypes for the design of kinase inhibitory compounds that achieve high specificity through covalent interaction and yet still bind reversibly to the ATP cleft, a strategy that could be applied to avoid issues with conventional covalent binders.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are key regulatory molecules that are implicated in diverse biological processes and human diseases, including preeclampsia. However, their expression and functions in the progression of preeclampsia remains largely unclear. In this study, lncRNA DLX6-AS1 was confirmed to be significantly upregulated in the placentas of patients with preeclampsia, compared with normal controls. Overexpression of DLX6-AS1 dramatically decreased proliferation, migration and invasion in trophoblast JEG3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells. Luciferase activity and RNA pull-down assays showed that DLX6-AS1 interacted with miR-376c, and that overexpression of DLX6-AS1 significantly reduced expression of miR-376c in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Also, miR-376c targeted and downregulated GADD45A in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Overexpression of GADD45A effectively attenuated a miR-376c-induced increase in the proliferation, migration and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Further research showed that DLX6-AS1-induced inhibition of trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion was effectively neutralized by GADD45A knockdown and miR-376c overexpression. Taken together, these findings suggest that DLX6-AS1 may contribute to preeclampsia by impairing proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of trophoblasts via the miR-376c/GADD45A axis.

Abstract: Orosomucoid like-3 (ORMDL3) has been identified to be associated with the development of asthma according to previous studies. However, the definite role of ORMDL3 in the pathogenesis of asthma remains unclear. In this study, we found ORMDL3 was highly expressed in PBMC specimens from childhood asthma patients. Cytokines production and p-ERK/MMP-9 pathway expression was also increased in childhood asthma patients compared with controls. In addition, ORMDL3 overexpression induced IL-6 and IL-8 release and activated p-ERK/MMP-9 pathway in vitro. Increased ORMDL3 expression was observed after treated with 5-Aza-CdR. 5-Aza-CdR decreased the percentage of the CpG island in the ORMDL3 promoter region and increased its promoter activity. In addition, 5-Aza-CdR significantly increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in NHBE cells while there was no obvious alteration after knocking down ORMDL3. Knockdown of ORMDL3 also significantly decreased the expression of p-ERK/MMP-9 pathway in the presence or absence of 5-Aza-CdR. In conclusion, our study provided novel evidence for the association between ORMDL3 and asthma-associated cytokines. Moreover, DNA methylation plays an important role in ORMDL3-mediated increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels and p-ERK/MMP-9 pathway expression.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the mother during pregnancy causes devastating Zika congenital syndrome in the offspring. A ZIKV vaccine with optimal safety and immunogenicity for use in pregnant women is critically needed. Toward this goal, we have developed a single-dose live-attenuated vaccine candidate that infects cells with controlled, limited infection rounds. The vaccine contains a 9-amino-acid deletion in the viral capsid protein and replicates to titers of > 106 focus-forming units (FFU)/mL in cells expressing the full-length capsid protein. Immunization of A129 mice with one dose (105 FFU) did not produce viremia, but elicited protective immunity that completely prevented viremia, morbidity, and mortality after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV strain (106 PFU). A single-dose vaccination also fully prevented infection of pregnant mice and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Intracranial injection of the vaccine (104 FFU) to 1-day-old mice did not cause any disease or death, underscoring the safety of this vaccine candidate.

Rnd3/RhoE expression is regulated by G-actin through MKL1-SRF signaling pathway,

Abstract: Rnd3/RhoE is an atypical member of the Rho family of small GTPases, devoid of intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity and a general modulator of important cellular processes such as migration and proliferation. Here, we show that Rnd3 is a target of the transcription factor SRF and its co-activator MKL1. The MKL1-SRF pathway assures the translation of physical forces into a transcriptional response. Rho GTPases can modulate the activity of this mechanotransduction pathway through actin cytoskeleton regulation, and many MKL1-SRF targets are involved in the regulation of actin. We found that Rnd3 expression is altered by G-actin signaling and sensitive to actin-targeting drugs and MKL1 mutants. We further characterized a consensus SRF binding site in the Rnd3 promoter. We found that MKL1-SRF modulation regulates Rnd3 promoter activity and Rnd3 expression can affect MKL1-SRF pathway activity in return. We demonstrated that this novel MKL1-SRF target is required in mechanosensitive mechanisms such as cell spreading and spheroid formation. Thus, Rnd3 is a MKL1-SRF target that plays a key role in the feedback loop described between the MKL1-SRF pathway and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: CD44, a glycoprotein, has been reported to have relationship with resistance to radiation in prostate cancer (Cap) cells. However, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibited CD44 enhanced the radiosentivity in Cap cells. It has been hypothesized that CD44 combine with ERBB2 and activate downstream phosphated protein to mediate DNA damage repair. Therefore, we conducted a detailed analysis of effects of radiation by clonogenic assay and immunofluorescence stain for p-H2AX foci. The downstream of CD44/ERBB2 and DNA damage repair proteins was detected by western blot. The results reveal that CD44 interacted with ERBB2, the downstream of CD44/ERBB2 was p-p38 when Cap cells were irradiated. Among the pathways, homologous recombination (HR) related proteins Mre11 and Rad50 were involved in CD44/ERBB2/p-p38 mediated radioresistance in Cap. In conclusion, CD44 could stabilize ERBB2 and co-activate p-p38 expression then promote the DNA damage repair by HR pathway, which finally contribute to the radioresistance of CaP.

Abstract: Developmental pluripotency associated factor 4 (Dppa4) is a highly specific marker of pluripotent cells, and is also overexpressed in certain cancers, but its function in either of these contexts is poorly understood. In this study, we use ChIP-Seq to identify Dppa4 binding genome-wide in three distinct cell types: mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), embryonal carcinoma cells, and 3T3 fibroblasts ectopically expressing Dppa4. We find a core set of Dppa4 binding sites shared across cell types, and also a substantial number of sites unique to each cell type. Across cell types Dppa4 shows a preference for binding to regions with active chromatin signatures, and can influence chromatin modifications at target genes. In 3T3 fibroblasts with enforced Dppa4 expression, Dppa4 represses the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn2c and activates Ets family transcription factor Etv4, leading to alterations in the cell cycle that likely contribute to the oncogenic phenotype. Dppa4 also directly regulates Etv4 in mESC but represses it in this context, and binds with Oct4 to a set of shared targets that are largely independent of Sox2 and Nanog, indicating that Dppa4 functions independently of the core pluripotency network in stem cells. Together these data provide novel insights into Dppa4 function in both pluripotent and oncogenic contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical application of stem cell derivatives requires clinical-grade cells and sufficient preclinical proof of safety and efficacy, preferably in primates. We previously successfully established a clinical-grade human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell (hPESC) line, but the suitability of its subtype-specific progenies for therapy is not clear. Here, we compared the function of clinical-grade hPESC-derived midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in two canonical protocols in a primate Parkinson's disease (PD) model. We found that the grafts did not form tumors and produced variable but apparent behavioral improvement for at least 24 months in most monkeys in both groups. In addition, a slight DA increase in the striatum correlates with significant functional improvement. These results demonstrated that clinical-grade hPESCs can serve as a reliable source of cells for PD treatment. Our proof-of-concept findings provide preclinical data for China's first ESC-based phase I/IIa clinical study of PD (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03119636).

Abstract: Summary
Multielectrode array (MEA) technology has been extensively used for field potential recordings from excitable cells. However, its application for action potential (AP) measurements has not been harnessed. Here, we report a novel platform for high-resolution intracellular AP recordings from induced pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocyte constructs derived from human cardiac fibroblasts. To gain intracellular access, micro-gold MEAs were used to electroporate multiple constructs simultaneously. High-throughput AP measurements were obtained from 41 multicellular constructs. Repeated electroporations of the same cells did not affect the signal stability. Our model has the capability to distinguish subtle differences in AP morphology to characterize the network profile. Furthermore, we confirm the reliability of the system by recapitulating known drug-induced physiological and arrhythmogenic responses. Overall, the model provides a unique cardio-electronic interface for non-invasive measurements of AP dynamics for drug screening and disease modeling. This technology opens the door for identifying novel cardio-factors to enhance electrophysiological maturation.

Abstract: Sevoflurane, an inhaled ether general anesthetic agent, exerts a variety of neurotoxic effects, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. DJ-1 is a protein that exerts neuroprotective effects against different kinds of stress through multiple pathways. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DJ-1 against sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we found that sevoflurane treatment significantly increased DJ-1 expression in human neuroblastoma M17 cells in a dose-dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of wild-type (WT) DJ-1 prevented sevoflurane-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), deletion of reduced GSH, reduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, we found that WT DJ-1 could inhibit sevoflurane-induced apoptosis by modulating the mitochondrial pathway. However, its “loss of function” mutation DJ-1(L166P) exacerbated sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in M17 cells. Our findings suggest that WT DJ-1 protects neuronal cells against sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Autophagy dysfunction has been observed in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) cells, a main contributing factor to cell death, but the precise role of autophagy during IVDD is still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the role of autophagy involved in the pathogenesis of human IVDD and determine the signal transduction pathways responsible for compression-induced autophagy in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Autophagy, suppressing the induction of apoptosis, was activated in NP cells exposed to compression. Molecular analysis showed that compression promoted the activity of NRF1, a transcription regulator increasing Atg7 expression by binding to its promoter, through activating the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling in NP cells. Loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that NRF1 induced autophagy and dampened the apoptotic response by promoting Atg7 expression in NP cells subjected to compression. This study confirmed that compression-induced autophagy could be induced by Ras via MEK/ERK/NRF1/Atg7 signaling pathways, while inhibiting Ras/MEK/ERK/NRF1/Atg7 signaling pathways attenuated this autophagic process, implicating a promising therapeutic strategy for IVDD.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock is a molecular pacemaker that produces 24-hr physiological cycles known as circadian rhythms. How the clock regulates stem cells is an emerging area of research with many outstanding questions. We tested clock function in vivo at the single cell resolution in the Drosophila intestine, a tissue that is exquisitely sensitive to environmental cues and has circadian rhythms in regeneration. Our results indicate that circadian clocks function in intestinal stem cells and enterocytes but are downregulated during enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Drosophila intestinal cells are principally synchronized by the photoperiod, but intestinal stem cell clocks are highly responsive to signaling pathways that comprise their niche, and we find that the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways positively regulate stem cell circadian clock function. These data reveal that intestinal stem cell circadian rhythms are regulated by cellular signaling and provide insight as to how clocks may be altered during physiological changes such as regeneration and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Aiming to unravel the top of the mammary epithelial cell hierarchy, a subset of the CD49fhighCD24med mammary repopulating units (MRUs) was identified by flow cytometry, expressing high levels of CD200 and its receptor CD200R1. These MRUCD200/CD200R1 repopulated a larger area of de-epithelized mammary fat pads than the rest of the MRUs, termed MRUnot CD200/CD200R1. MRUCD200/CD200R1 maintained a much lower number of divergently defined, highly expressed genes and pathways that support better cell growth, development, differentiation, and progenitor activity than their MRUnot CD200/CD200R1 counterparts. A defined profile of hierarchically associated genes supporting a single-lineage hypothesis was confirmed by in vitro mammosphere analysis that assembled 114 genes with decreased expression from MRUCD200/CD200R1 via MRUnot CD200/CD200R1 toward CD200+CD200R1− and CD200R1+CD200− cells. About 40% of these genes were shared by a previously published database of upregulated genes in mammary/breast stem cells and may represent the core genes involved in mammary stemness.

Abstract: Compelling evidences have shown that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide is one of the major pathogenic factors resulting in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying BBB breakdown remains elusive. In our present study, we employed murine brain capillary endothelial cells (bEnd.3) as an in vitro BBB model to investigate the role of autophagy in Aβ1–42 oligo induced BBB disruption. We first identified Aβ1–42 oligo cytotoxicity to bEnd.3 cells as observed in the reduced cell viability and downregulation of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5. Based on the observation that both downregulated expression of p-mTOR/m-TOR and upregulated ratio of LC3-II/β-actin were induced by Aβ1–42 oligo, we then applied 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy, to test the role of autophagy in Aβ1–42 oligo induced Tight junction (TJ) proteins damage. Results have shown that 3-MA partially reversed Aβ1–42 oligo induced downregulation of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5, which was further determined by LC3 siRNA. We also used rapamycin to activate autophagy and found that TJ proteins damage induced by Aβ1–42 was deteriorated even further. Given that the receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a pivotal receptor that mediates Aβ toxicity, RAGE siRNA was utilized to identify the involvement of RAGE in Aβ1–42 oligo induced autophagy. The results demonstrated a suppressed autophagy with increased p-mTOR/m-TOR and decreased LC3-II/β-actin as well as increased ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 in transfected cells after Aβ1–42 oligo treatment, as compared to the non-transfected group. In summary, these results suggested that Aβ1–42 oligo induced TJ proteins disruption via a RAGE-dependent autophagy pathway.

Abstract: The present study investigated the role of Wnt11 in multicellular tumor spheroid-like structures (MCTS) ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis in xenograft nude mice model. Moreover, samples from human serous ovarian cancer (SOC) were used to assess the association of Wnt11 with integrins and cadherins. The data showed that Wnt11 overexpressing SKOV-3 cells became more compact accompanied by increased expression of E-and N-cadherin and lower expression of EpCAM and CD44. The α5, β2, β3 and β6 integrin subunits expression levels were significantly reduced in Wnt11 overexpressing cells accompanied with significantly reduced disaggregation of Wnt11 overexpressing SKOV-3 MCTS on ECM components. Moreover, Wnt11 overexpressing SKOV-3 MCTS showed decreased migration, invasion as well as no tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We found that Wnt11 significantly and negatively correlated with ITGB2, ITGB6, and EpCAM and positively with CDH-1 in high-grade SOC specimens. Our results suggest that Wnt11 impedes MCTS attachment to ECM components and therefore can affect ovarian cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian selenocysteine (Sec)-containing proteins, selenoproteins, are important to (patho)physiological processes, including redox homeostasis. Sec residues have been recalcitrant to mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomic methods that enrich for reactive cysteine (Cys) residues with electrophilic chemical probes, despite confirmed reactivity of Sec with these electrophiles. Highly abundant Cys peptides likely suppress low-abundant Sec peptides. By exploiting the decreased pKa of Sec relative to Cys, we have developed a chemoproteomic platform that relies on low pH (pH 5.75) electrophile labeling, reducing Cys reactivity and enhancing identification of Sec-containing peptides across mouse tissues and cell lines. The utility of this Sec-profiling platform is underscored by evaluation of the selectivity of auranofin, an inhibitor of the selenoprotein, thioredoxin reductase, against both reactive Cys- and Sec-containing proteins. Platform limitations pertain to the non-physiological low-pH conditions that could perturb protein structure and function. Future work necessitates the discovery of Sec-selective electrophiles that function at physiological pH.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen with multiple immune evasion strategies, including virally facilitated degradation of host antiviral restriction factors. Here, we describe a multiplexed approach to discover proteins with innate immune function on the basis of active degradation by the proteasome or lysosome during early-phase HCMV infection. Using three orthogonal proteomic/transcriptomic screens to quantify protein degradation, with high confidence we identified 35 proteins enriched in antiviral restriction factors. A final screen employed a comprehensive panel of viral mutants to predict viral genes that target >250 human proteins. This approach revealed that helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a DNA helicase important in DNA repair, potently inhibits early viral gene expression but is rapidly degraded during infection. The functionally unknown HCMV protein UL145 facilitates HLTF degradation by recruiting the Cullin4 E3 ligase complex. Our approach and data will enable further identifications of innate pathways targeted by HCMV and other viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Coenzyme A (CoA) esters of short fatty acids (acyl-CoAs) function as key precursors for the biosynthesis of various natural products and the dominant donors for lysine acylation. Herein, we investigated the functional interplay between beneficial and adverse effects of acyl-CoA supplements on the production of acyl-CoA-derived natural products in microorganisms by using erythromycin-biosynthesized Saccharopolyspora erythraea as a model: accumulation of propionyl-CoA benefited erythromycin biosynthesis, but lysine propionylation inhibited the activities of important enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways of erythromycin. The results showed that the overexpression of NAD+-dependent deacylase could circumvent the inhibitory effects of high acyl-CoA concentrations. In addition, we demonstrated the similar lysine acylation mechanism in other acyl-CoA-derived natural product biosynthesis, such as malonyl-CoA-derived alkaloid and butyryl-CoA-derived bioalcohol. These observations systematically uncovered the important role of protein acylation on interaction between the accumulation of high concentrations of acyl-CoAs and the efficiency of their use in metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens have been a strong driving force for natural selection. Therefore, understanding how human genetic differences impact infection-related cellular traits can mechanistically link genetic variation to disease susceptibility. Here we report the Hi-HOST Phenome Project (H2P2): a catalog of cellular genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 79 infection-related phenotypes in response to 8 pathogens in 528 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Seventeen loci surpass genome-wide significance for infection-associated phenotypes ranging from pathogen replication to cytokine production. We combined H2P2 with clinical association data from patients to identify a SNP near CXCL10 as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. A SNP in the transcriptional repressor ZBTB20 demonstrated pleiotropy, likely through suppression of multiple target genes, and was associated with viral hepatitis. These data are available on a web portal to facilitate interpreting human genome variation through the lens of cell biology and should serve as a rich resource for the research community.

Abstract: Summary
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are important prebiotic complex carbohydrates with demonstrated beneficial effects on the microbiota of neonates. However, optimization of their biotechnological synthesis is limited by the relatively low throughput of monosaccharide and linkage analysis. To enable high-throughput screening of HMO structures, we constructed a whole-cell biosensor that uses heterologous expression of glycosidases to generate linkage-specific, quantitative fluorescent readout for a range of HMOs at detection limits down to 20 μM in approximately 6 hr. We also demonstrate the use of this system for orthogonal control of growth rate or protein expression of particular strains in mixed populations. This work enables rapid non-chromatographic linkage analysis and lays the groundwork for the application of directed evolution to biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates as well as the prebiotic manipulation of population dynamics in natural and engineered microbial communities.

Abstract: Background
Intestinal barrier dysfunctions are related to dysbacteriosis and chronic gut inflammation in type 2 diabetes. Although there is emerging evidence that the chronic gut inflammatory response is stimulated by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs), the relationship and precise mechanism between NLRC3 and the colonic epithelial barrier remains largely elusive.
Methods
We investigated the function and mechanism of NLRC3 in the colonic tissues of diabetic mice and colonic epithelial cell lines. The regulatory mechanism between NLRC3, butyrate and tight junctions was elucidated via a transepithelial electrical resistance measurement, transmission electron microscopy, RNA interference and western blotting.
Results
In this study, we found that NLRC3 expression was decreased in the colonic tissues of diabetic mice. NLRC3 over-expression ameliorated colonic epithelial barrier integrity and up-regulated tight junction proteins in colonic epithelial cells. Knockdown of TRAF6 diminished NLRC3-induced ZO-1/occludin expression. In addition, we demonstrated that butyrate could stimulate NLRC3 expression in both diabetic mice and colonic epithelial cells. GPR43 on colonic epithelial cells is involved in the activation of NLRC3 induced by butyrate.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrated that NLCR3 could ameliorate colonic epithelial barrier integrity in diabetes mellitus in a TRAF6-dependent manner, and NLCR3 was stimulated by butyrate via binding GPR43 on colonic epithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that mediates escape of Listeria monocytogenes from a phagosome, enabling growth of the bacteria in the host cell cytosol. LLO contains a PEST-like sequence that prevents it from killing infected cells, but the mechanism involved is unknown. We found that the LLO PEST-like sequence was necessary to mediate removal of LLO from the interior face of the plasma membrane, where it coalesces into discrete puncta. LLO interacts with Ap2a2, an adaptor protein involved in endocytosis, via its PEST-like sequence, and Ap2a2-dependent endocytosis is required to prevent LLO-induced cytotoxicity. An unrelated PEST-like sequence from a human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which also interacts with Ap2a2, could functionally complement the PEST-like sequence in L. monocytogenes LLO. These data revealed that LLO co-opts the host endocytosis machinery to protect the integrity of the host plasma membrane during L. monocytogenes infection.

Abstract: Lung fibroblasts play critical roles in fibrotic procedures and contribute to lung fibrosis. Several studies indicated that thrombin, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) participate in the formation of pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we examined the involvement of the ADAM17/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in thrombin-stimulated CTGF manifestation in human lung fibroblasts (WI-38). We found that cells treated with thrombin significantly increased ADAM17 expression, ADAM17 and c-Jun phosphorylation in time-dependent manners. Thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression, ERK and c-Jun phosphorylation were inhibited by TAPI-0 (an ADAM17 inhibitor). Moreover, U0126 (an ERK inhibitor) inhibited thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression and c-Jun phosphorylation. Cells transfected with small interfering RNA of the EGFR attenuated thrombin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and CTGF expression. Thus, these results suggested that ADAM17/EGFR-dependent ERK activation mediated thrombin-stimulated CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts.

Abstract: Aortic dissection (AD) is the circumferential or transversal tear of the aorta wall that allows blood to infiltrate the layers. MicroRNA (miR) analyses have demonstrated a correlation between miR-320 family and AD. The underlying mechanism is yet unclear. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of proteolytic enzymes that could catalyze the degeneration of the extracellular matrix and the destruction of the vasculature. In this study, we investigated whether miR-320 presented a role in regulating the production of MMPs in aortic dissection. In a cohort of 30 CE patients and 30 healthy controls, the transcription and secretion of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-12 by monocytes were investigated. The monocyte from AD patients presented significantly elevated capacity of MMP expression than those from healthy controls. In contrast, the monocyte/macrophage expression of miR-320 was significantly lower in AD patients than in controls. In both AD patients and healthy controls, LPS-activation of macrophages resulted in MMP upregulation and miR-320 downregulation, in which the MMP expression was significantly higher while the miR-320 expression was significantly lower in AD patients than in healthy controls. Transfection of miR-320 mimic did not affect MMP gene transcription but significantly reduced the protein production in some MMPs, demonstrated that miR-320 were involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of MMPs. Together, these results demonstrated that miR-320 could regulate the expression of MMPs by macrophages, through which miR-320 may interfere with AD development.

Abstract: Summary
Directed biomolecular evolution is widely used to tailor and enhance enzymes, fluorescent proteins, and antibodies but has hitherto not been applied in the reprogramming of mammalian cells. Here, we describe a method termed directed evolution of reprogramming factors by cell selection and sequencing (DERBY-seq) to identify artificially enhanced and evolved reprogramming transcription factors. DERBY-seq entails pooled screens with libraries of positionally randomised genes, cell selection based on phenotypic readouts, and genotyping by amplicon sequencing for candidate identification. We benchmark this approach using pluripotency reprogramming with libraries based on the reprogramming factor SOX2 and the reprogramming incompetent endodermal factor SOX17. We identified several SOX2 variants outperforming the wild-type protein in three- and four-factor cocktails. The most effective variants were discovered from the SOX17 library, demonstrating that this factor can be converted into a highly potent inducer of pluripotency with a range of diverse modifications. We propose DERBY-seq as a broad-based approach to discover reprogramming factors for any donor/target cell combination applicable to direct lineage reprogramming in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic management, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patient survival rates have remained relatively unchanged. Thus, identifying early triggers of malignant progression is critical to prevent OSCC development. Traditionally, OSCC initiation is elicited by the frequent and direct exposure to multiple tobacco-derived carcinogens, and not by the nicotine contained in tobacco products. However, other nicotine-containing products, especially the increasingly popular electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), have unknown effects on the progression of undiagnosed tobacco-induced oral premalignant lesions, specifically in regard to the effects of nicotine. Overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key hepatic de novo lipogenic enzyme, is linked to poor OSCC patient survival. Nicotine upregulates hepatic FASN, but whether this response occurs in oral dysplastic keratinocytes is unknown. We hypothesized that in oral dysplastic keratinocytes, nicotine triggers a migratory phenotype through FASN-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, a common pro-oncogenic event supporting oral carcinogenesis. We report that in oral dysplastic cells, nicotine markedly upregulates FASN leading to FASN-dependent EGFR activation and increased cell migration. These results raise potential concerns about e-cig safety, especially when used by former tobacco smokers with occult oral premalignant lesions where nicotine could trigger oncogenic signals commonly associated with malignant progression.

Abstract: The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Given their multiple tumor promoting roles, MMPs are promising targets for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Using a siRNA library screen of 140 membrane trafficking genes, we identified 41 genes in HEC-1B and 36 in Ishikawa cancer cells that decreased metalloproteinases activity. The 16 genes common in both cancer cell lines that decreased MMPs activity are involved in cargo sorting, vesicle formation and vesicle recycling. The top two genes clathrin-B and cofilin-1 were chosen for post hoc functional studies. Higher expression of both genes was confirmed in cancer cells and knockdown with respective siRNAs inhibited their invasive potential and matrix metalloproteinases activity. Membrane Type 1- Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a master switch proteinase and regulator of invasion and metastasis. A marked decrease in MT1-MMP expression and activity was seen in clathrin-B and cofilin-1 knockdown cancer cells which was associated with a marked decreased expression of invadopodia formation proteins. Our results suggest that the decreased expression of clathrin-B and cofilin-1 decreases the expression of MT1-MMP and results in attenuation of MT1-MMP at the cell surface, thus inhibiting tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers diagnosed worldwide. However, the mechanism underlying HCC pathogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, TRIM24 was found increased in human HCC clinical samples and positively correlated with HCC tumor grade. Furthermore, TRIM24 knockdown inhibits proliferation and migration in a human HCC cell line in vitro while also inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, TRIM24 appears to promote liver tumor development via AMPK signaling as AMPK knockdown alleviated the in vitro and in vivo effects of TRIM24 knockdown in a human HCC cell line. Taken together, these data enhance our understanding of HCC development in addition to highlighting TRIM24-regulated AMPK signaling as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a tedious and variable process. This hampers the study of hPSC-generated astrocytes in disease processes and drug development. By using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inducible expression of NFIA or NFIA plus SOX9 in hPSCs, we developed a method to efficiently generate astrocytes in 4–7 weeks. The astrocytic identity of the induced cells was verified by their characteristic molecular and functional properties as well as after transplantation. Furthermore, we developed a strategy to generate region-specific astrocyte subtypes by combining differentiation of regional progenitors and transgenic induction of astrocytes. This simple and efficient method offers a new opportunity to study the fundamental biology of human astrocytes and their roles in disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
The Plasmodium cell cycle, wherein millions of parasites differentiate and proliferate, occurs in synchrony with the vertebrate host's circadian cycle. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we addressed this question in a mouse model of Plasmodium chabaudi infection. Inflammatory gene expression and carbohydrate metabolism are both enhanced in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-primed leukocytes and liver cells from P. chabaudi-infected mice. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) expression oscillates across the host circadian cycle, and increased TNFα correlates with hypoglycemia and a higher frequency of non-replicative ring forms of trophozoites. Conversely, parasites proliferate and acquire biomass during food intake by the host. Importantly, cyclic hypoglycemia is attenuated and synchronization of P. chabaudi stages is disrupted in IFNγ−/−, TNF receptor−/−, or diabetic mice. Hence, the daily rhythm of systemic TNFα production and host food intake set the pace for Plasmodium synchronization with the host's circadian cycle. This mechanism indicates that Plasmodium parasites take advantage of the host's feeding habits.

Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. During cardiac failure, the metabolism of cardiomyocyte switches from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. However, the roles of key metabolic enzymes in cardiac hypertrophy are not understood fully. Here in the present work, we identified Aldolase A (AldoA) as a core regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. The mRNA and protein levels of AldoA were significantly up-regulated in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)- and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophic mouse hearts. Overexpression of AldoA in cardiomyocytes promoted ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas AldoA knockdown repressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated in vivo knockdown of AldoA in the hearts rescued ISO-induced decrease in cardiac ejection fraction and fractional shortening and repressed cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanism study revealed that AldoA repressed the activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in a liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-dependent and AMP-independent manner. Inactivation of AMPK is a core mechanism underlying AldoA-mediated promotion of ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. By contrast, activation of AMPK with metformin and AICAR blocked AldoA function during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In summary, our data support the notion that AldoA-AMPK axis is a core regulatory signaling sensing energetic status and participates in cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Gentamicin (GNT)-induced nephrotoxicity culminates into renal failure with a possible cardiovascular impact. Garlic extract (GE) is a cardiovascular protectant with limited mechanistic data. Therefore, we assessed the disturbance in specific cardiac parameters and the potential protective effect of GE supplementation against them in a rat model of GNT-induced chronic renal failure (CRF). Adult male rats (n = 24) were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 6 each): normal controls (CON), garlic extract controls (GE; 250 mg kg−1, orally), GNT-induced CRF (GNT; 100 mg kg−1, i.p.), and GNT + GE (GNT and GE in the same previous doses) groups. GNT and GE were given daily for 3 weeks. Animals co-treated with GNT and GE exhibited improved renal functions, body weight (BW), and heart weight (HW)/BW ratio; declined blood pressure; lowered plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and total peroxides (TP); and elevated total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels. Moreover, the heart tissue contained raised levels of TAC and Na+/K+-ATPase activity and lowered levels of TP and Ca2+. Findings provide evidence that administration of GE in experimental CRF model helped protect the heart through reducing oxidative stress and controlling cardiac Na+/K+-ATPase activity and Ca2+ levels.

Abstract: Surgical stress has been shown to facilitate the tumor growth and metastasis of colon cancer. To unravel the mechanisms underlying surgery induced-colon cancer progression, a syngeneic transplantation tumor model was established with murine colon cancer CT26 cells and the effect of laparotomy on tumor progression was investigated. Especially the expression of several CXC chemokines was assayed, and its roles in regulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) recruitment were analyzed. We found that laparotomy promoted in vivo tumor growth and angiogenesis. CXCL4 expression was significantly downregulated by laparotomy in the tumor tissue and the peritoneal cavity. Functionally, CXCL4 overexpression significantly reduces tumor volume compared to control. Through analysis of CD11b+/Gr1+ MDSCs cell, we found an upregulated proportion of MDSCs in the tumor tissues and peritoneal cavity following laparotomy, and this enhancement was blocked after CXCL4 overexpression. Further, a negative correlation was found between CXCL4 expression and MDSC amounts in clinical samples. Higher CXCL4 expression and lower MDSCs proportion is positively related to overall survival.
Conclusion
Surgical trauma contributes to colon cancer progression by downregulating CXCL4 and hence promoting MDSC recruitment, which leads to an immunosuppressive environment.

Abstract: Coral bleaching occurs worldwide with increasing frequencies and intensities, which is caused by the stress response of stony coral to environmental change, especially increased sea surface temperature. In the present study, transcriptome, expression, and activity analyses were employed to illustrate the underlying molecular mechanisms of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the stress response of coral to environmental changes. The domain analyses of assembled transcripts revealed 30 HSP70 gene contigs in stony coral Pocillopora damicornis. One crucial HSP70 (PdHSP70) was observed, whose expressions were induced by both elevated temperature and ammonium after expression difference analysis. The complete complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of PdHSP70 was identified, which encoded a polypeptide of 650 amino acids with a molecular weight of 71.93 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of PdHSP70 contained a HSP70 domain (from Pro8 to Gly616), and it shared the highest similarity (95%) with HSP70 from Stylophora pistillata. The expression level of PdHSP70 gene increased significantly at 12 h, and returned to the initial level at 24 h after the stress of high temperature (32 °C). The cDNA fragment encoding the mature peptide of PdHSP70 was recombined and expressed in the prokaryotic expression system. The ATPase activity of recombinant PdHSP70 protein was determined, and it did not change significantly in a wide range of temperature from 25 to 40 °C. These results collectively suggested that PdHSP70 was a vital heat shock protein 70 in the stony coral P. damicornis, whose mRNA expression could be induced by diverse environmental stress and whose activity could remain stable under heat stress. PdHSP70 might be involved in the regulation of the bleaching owing to heat stress in the stony coral P. damicornis.
