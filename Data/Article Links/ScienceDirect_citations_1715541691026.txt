Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) is activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We show here that PI3Kγ inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR, a GPCR) complex altering G protein coupling. PI3Kγ inhibition results in significant increase of βAR-associated phosphatase activity leading to receptor dephosphorylation and resensitization preserving cardiac function. Mechanistically, PI3Kγ inhibits PP2A activity at the βAR complex by phosphorylating an intracellular inhibitor of PP2A (I2PP2A) on serine residues 9 and 93, resulting in enhanced binding to PP2A. Indeed, enhanced phosphorylation of β2ARs is observed with a phosphomimetic I2PP2A mutant that was completely reversed with a mutant mimicking dephosphorylated state. siRNA depletion of endogenous I2PP2A augments PP2A activity despite active PI3K resulting in β2AR dephosphorylation and sustained signaling. Our study provides the underpinnings of a PI3Kγ-mediated regulation of PP2A activity that has significant consequences on receptor function with broad implications in cellular signaling.

Abstract: Summary
During meiosis I, kinetochores of sister chromatids are juxtaposed or fused and mono-orient, while homologous chromosomes that are paired by chiasmata (bivalents) have to biorient. In the absence of chiasmata, biorientation of sister chromatids (univalents), which carries a risk of aneuploidy, has been occasionally detected in several species, including humans. We show in fission yeast that biorientation of fused sister kinetochores predominates during early prometaphase I. Without chiasmata, this undesirable biorientation of univalents persists and eventually evades the spindle assembly checkpoint, provoking abnormal anaphase. When univalents are connected by chiasmata or by an artificial tether, this erroneous attachment is converted to monopolar attachment and stabilized. This stabilization is apparently achieved by a chromosome configuration that brings kinetochores to the outer edge of the bivalent, while bringing Aurora B, a destabilizer of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, inward. Our results elucidate how chiasmata favor biorientation of bivalents over that of univalents at meiosis I.

Abstract: Summary
To identify oncogenic pathways in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we combined expression profiling of 117 pediatric patient samples and detailed molecular-cytogenetic analyses including the Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) method. Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes, and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C, or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2, and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements.

Abstract: The structural and ultrastructural characteristics of giant interneurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the cricket Nemobius sylvestris were investigated by means of cobalt and fluorescent dye backfilling and transmission electron microscopy. The projections of the 8 eight pairs of the biggest ascending interneurons (giant interneurons) are described in detail. The somata of all interneurons analyzed are located contralateral to their axons, which project to the posterior region of the terminal ganglion and arborise in the cercal glomerulus. Neuron 7-1a is an exception, because its arborisation is restricted to the anterior region of the ganglion. The fine structure of giant interneurons shows typical features of highly active cells. We observed striking indentations in the perineural layer, enabling the somata of the giant interneurons to be very close to the haemolymph. The cercal glomerulus exhibits a high diversity of synaptic contacts (i.e. axo-dendritic, axo-axonic, dendro-axonic, and dendro-dendritic), as well as areas of tight junctions. Electrical synapses seem to be present, as well as mixed synapses. The anatomical organization of the giant interneurons is finally discussed in terms of functional implications and on a comparative basis.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, a crucial step of translation initiation is the binding of the multifactor complex eIF4F to the 5′ end of the mRNA, a prerequisite to recruitment of the activated small ribosomal 43S particle. Histone H4 mRNAs have short 5′UTRs, which do not conform to the conventional scanning-initiation model. Here we show that the ORF of histone mRNA contains two structural elements critical for translation initiation. One of the two structures binds eIF4E without the need of the cap. Ribosomal 43S particles become tethered to this site and directly loaded in the vicinity of the AUG. The other structure, 19 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon, forms a three-way helix junction, which sequesters the m7G cap. This element facilitates direct positioning of the ribosome on the cognate start codon. This unusual translation initiation mode might be considered as a hybrid mechanism between the canonical and the IRES-driven translation initiation process.

Abstract: Summary
Both EZH2 and NF-κB contribute to aggressive breast cancer, yet whether the two oncogenic factors have functional crosstalk in breast cancer is unknown. Here, we uncover an unexpected role of EZH2 in conferring the constitutive activation of NF-κB target gene expression in ER-negative basal-like breast cancer cells. This function of EZH2 is independent of its histone methyltransferase activity but requires the physical interaction with RelA/RelB to promote the expression of NF-κB targets. Intriguingly, EZH2 acts oppositely in ER-positive luminal-like breast cancer cells and represses NF-κB target gene expression by interacting with ER and directing repressive histone methylation on their promoters. Thus, EZH2 functions as a double-facet molecule in breast cancers, either as a transcriptional activator or repressor of NF-κB targets, depending on the cellular context. These findings reveal an additional mechanism by which EZH2 promotes breast cancer progression and underscore the need for developing context-specific strategy for therapeutic targeting of EZH2 in breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Transcript-selective translational regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is directed by the hnRNP E1-containing TGF-β-activated-translational (BAT) mRNP complex. Herein, eukaryotic elongation factor-1 A1 (eEF1A1) is identified as an integral component of the BAT complex. Translational silencing of Dab2 and ILEI, two EMT transcripts, is mediated by the binding of hnRNP E1 and eEF1A1 to their 3′UTR BAT element, whereby hnRNP E1 stalls translational elongation by inhibiting the release of eEF1A1 from the ribosomal A site. TGF-β-mediated hnRNP E1 phosphorylation, through Akt2, disrupts the BAT complex, thereby restoring translation of target EMT transcripts. Attenuation of hnRNP E1 expression in two noninvasive breast epithelial cells (NMuMG and MCF-7) not only induced EMT but also enabled cells to form metastatic lesions in vivo. Thus, translational regulation by TGF-β at the elongation stage represents a critical checkpoint coordinating the expression of EMT transcripts required during development and in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila Dicer-2 generates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), whereas Dicer-1 produces microRNAs (miRNAs) from pre-miRNA. What makes the two Dicers specific for their biological substrates? We find that purified Dicer-2 can efficiently cleave pre-miRNA, but that inorganic phosphate and the Dicer-2 partner protein R2D2 inhibit pre-miRNA cleavage. Dicer-2 contains C-terminal RNase III domains that mediate RNA cleavage and an N-terminal helicase motif, whose function is unclear. We show that Dicer-2 is a dsRNA-stimulated ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP; ATP hydrolysis is required for Dicer-2 to process long dsRNA, but not pre-miRNA. Wild-type Dicer-2, but not a mutant defective in ATP hydrolysis, can generate siRNAs faster than it can dissociate from a long dsRNA substrate. We propose that the Dicer-2 helicase domain uses ATP to generate many siRNAs from a single molecule of dsRNA before dissociating from its substrate.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are currently being introduced for cell therapy, yet, antibodies specific for native and differentiated MSCs are required for their identification prior to clinical use. Herein, high quality antibodies against MSC surface proteins were developed by immunizing mice with hMSC, and by using a panel of subsequent screening methods. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 83.5, 1.1, and 8.5% of primary cultures of hMSC were double positive for STRO-1 and either of DJ 3, 9, and 18, respectively. However, none of the three DJ antibodies allowed enrichment of clonogenic hMSC from BMMNCs as single reagents. Using mass-spectrometric analysis, we identified the antigen recognised by DJ3 as CD44, whereas DJ9 and DJ18 recognized HLA-DRB1 and Collagen VI, respectively. The identified proteins were highly expressed throughout in vitro osteogenic- and adipogenic differentiation. Interestingly, undifferentiated cells revealed a sole cytoplasmic distribution pattern of Collagen VI, which however changed to an extracellular matrix appearance upon osteogenic- and adipogenic differentiation. In relation to this, we found that STRO-1+/-/Collagen VI- sorted hMSC contained fewer differentiated alkaline phosphatase+ cells compared to STRO-1+/-/Collagen VI+ hMSC, suggesting that Collagen VI on the cell membrane exclusively defines differentiated MSCs. In conclusion, we have generated a panel of high quality antibodies to be used for characterization of MSCs, and in addition our results may suggest that the DJ18 generated antibody against Collagen VI can be used for negative selection of cultured undifferentiated MSCs.

Abstract: Hempseed is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which have potential as therapeutic compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease. However, the effect of hempseed meal (HSM) intake on the animal models of these diseases has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we assessed the effects of the intake of HSM and PUFAs on oxidative stress, cytotoxicity and neurological phenotypes, and cholesterol uptake, using Drosophila models. HSM intake was shown to reduce H2O2 toxicity markedly, indicating that HSM exerts a profound antioxidant effect. Meanwhile, intake of HSM, as well as linoleic or linolenic acids (major PUFA components of HSM) was shown to ameliorate Aβ42-induced eye degeneration, thus suggesting that these compounds exert a protective effect against Aβ42 cytotoxicity. On the contrary, locomotion and longevity in the Parkinson’s disease model and eye degeneration in the Huntington’s disease model were unaffected by HSM feeding. Additionally, intake of HSM or linoleic acid was shown to reduce cholesterol uptake significantly. Moreover, linoleic acid intake has been shown to delay pupariation, and cholesterol feeding rescued the linoleic acid-induced larval growth delay, thereby indicating that linoleic acid acts antagonistically with cholesterol during larval growth. In conclusion, our results indicate that HSM and linoleic acid exert inhibitory effects on both Aβ42 cytotoxicity and cholesterol uptake, and are potential candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
The de novo design of protein-protein interfaces is a stringent test of our understanding of the principles underlying protein-protein interactions and would enable unique approaches to biological and medical challenges. Here we describe a motif-based method to computationally design protein-protein complexes with native-like interface composition and interaction density. Using this method we designed a pair of proteins, Prb and Pdar, that heterodimerize with a Kd of 130 nM, 1000-fold tighter than any previously designed de novo protein-protein complex. Directed evolution identified two point mutations that improve affinity to 180 pM. Crystal structures of an affinity-matured complex reveal binding is entirely through the designed interface residues. Surprisingly, in the in vitro evolved complex one of the partners is rotated 180° relative to the original design model, yet still maintains the central computationally designed hotspot interaction and preserves the character of many peripheral interactions. This work demonstrates that high-affinity protein interfaces can be created by designing complementary interaction surfaces on two noninteracting partners and underscores remaining challenges.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are key transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism. To define functional differences between the three mammalian SREBPs we used genome-wide ChIP-seq with isoform-specific antibodies and chromatin from select tissues of mice challenged with different dietary conditions that enrich for specific SREBPs. We show that hepatic SREBP-2 binds preferentially to two different gene-proximal motifs. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggests SREBP-2 targets lipid metabolic processes as expected, but apoptosis and autophagy gene categories were also enriched. We show that SREBP-2 directly activates autophagy genes during cell-sterol depletion, conditions known to induce both autophagy and nuclear SREBP-2 levels. Additionally, SREBP-2 knockdown during nutrient depletion decreased autophagosome formation and lipid droplet association of the autophagosome targeting protein LC3. Thus, the lipid droplet could be viewed as a third source of cellular cholesterol, which along with sterol synthesis and uptake, is also regulated by SREBP-2.

Abstract: Investigations into the functional modulation of the cardiac Na+–Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) by acute β-adrenoceptor/PKA stimulation have produced conflicting results. Here, we investigated (i) whether or not β-adrenoceptor activation/PKA stimulation activates current in rabbit cardiac myocytes under NCX-‘selective’ conditions and (ii) if so, whether a PKA-activated Cl−-current may contribute to the apparent modulation of NCX current (INCX). Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were conducted at 37°C on rabbit ventricular and atrial myocytes. The β-adrenoceptor-activated currents both in NCX-‘selective’ and Cl−-selective recording conditions were found to be sensitive to 10mM Ni2+. In contrast, the PKA-activated Cl− current was not sensitive to Ni2+, when it was activated downstream to the β-adrenoceptors using 10μM forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase activator). When 10μM forskolin was applied under NCX-selective recording conditions, the Ni2+-sensitive current did not differ between control and forskolin. These findings suggest that in rabbit myocytes: (a) a PKA-activated Cl− current contributes to the Ni2+-sensitive current activated via β-adrenoceptor stimulation under recording conditions previously considered selective for INCX; (b) downstream activation of PKA does not augment Ni2+-sensitive INCX, when this is measured under conditions where the Ni2+-sensitive PKA-activated Cl− current is not present.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the engraftment properties and impact on patient outcome of 50 pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. Time to leukemia (TTL) was determined for each patient sample engrafted as weeks from transplant to overt leukemia. Short TTL was strongly associated with high risk for early relapse, identifying an independent prognostic factor. This high-risk phenotype is reflected by a gene signature that upon validation in an independent patient cohort (n = 197) identified a high-risk cluster of patients with early relapse. Furthermore, the signature points to independent pathways, including mTOR, involved in cell growth and apoptosis. The pathways identified can directly be targeted, thereby offering additional treatment approaches for these high-risk patients.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a unique membrane trafficking pathway describing the formation and targeting of double membrane autophagosomes to the vacuole/lysosome. The biogenesis of autophagosomes and their delivery to the vacuole/lysosome depend on multiple membrane fusion events. Using a cell-free system, we have investigated the ability of LC3 and GATE-16, two mammalian Atg8 orthologs, to mediate membrane fusion. We found that both proteins promote tethering and membrane fusion, mediated by the proteins' N-terminal α helices. We further show that short, 10 amino acid long synthetic peptides derived from the N terminus of LC3 or GATE-16 are sufficient to promote membrane fusion. Our data indicate that the fusion activity of LC3 is mediated by positively charged amino acids, whereas the activity of GATE-16 is mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that LC3 and GATE-16 N termini in general and specific residues needed for the fusion activity are essential for the proteins role in autophagosome biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Sen1 of S. cerevisiae is a known component of the NRD complex implicated in transcription termination of nonpolyadenylated as well as some polyadenylated RNA polymerase II transcripts. We now show that Sen1 helicase possesses a wider function by restricting the occurrence of RNA:DNA hybrids that may naturally form during transcription, when nascent RNA hybridizes to DNA prior to its packaging into RNA protein complexes. These hybrids displace the nontranscribed strand and create R loop structures. Loss of Sen1 results in transient R loop accumulation and so elicits transcription-associated recombination. SEN1 genetically interacts with DNA repair genes, suggesting that R loop resolution requires proteins involved in homologous recombination. Based on these findings, we propose that R loop formation is a frequent event during transcription and a key function of Sen1 is to prevent their accumulation and associated genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor hypoxia is associated with disease progression and treatment failure, but the hypoxia signaling mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that KLHL20, a Cullin3 (Cul3) substrate adaptor induced by HIF-1, coordinates with the actions of CDK1/2 and Pin1 to mediate hypoxia-induced PML proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, this PML destruction pathway participates in a feedback mechanism to maximize HIF-1α induction, thereby potentiating multiple tumor hypoxia responses, including metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. In human prostate cancer, overexpression of HIF-1α, KLHL20, and Pin1 correlates with PML down-regulation, and hyperactivation of the PML destruction pathway is associated with disease progression. Our study indicates that the KLHL20-mediated PML degradation and HIF-1α autoregulation play key roles in tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Cdc48/p97 is an essential ATPase whose role in targeting substrates to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) remains unclear. Existing models posit that Cdc48 acts upstream of UPS receptors. To address this hypothesis, we examined the association of ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates with 26S proteasomes. Unexpectedly, proteasomes isolated from cdc48 mutants contain high levels of Ub conjugates, and mass spectrometry identified numerous nonproteasomal proteins, including Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA Pol II. UV-induced turnover of Rpb1 depends upon Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4, Ubx4, and the uncharacterized adaptor Ubx5. Ubiquitinated Rpb1, proteasomes, and Cdc48 accumulate on chromatin in UV-treated wild-type cells, and the former two accumulate to higher levels in mutant cells, suggesting that degradation of Rpb1 is facilitated by Cdc48 at sites of stalled transcription. These data reveal an intimate coupling of function between proteasomes and Cdc48 that we suggest is necessary to sustain processive degradation of unstable subunits of some macromolecular protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Neoantigens derived from somatic mutations in tumors may provide a critical link between the adaptive immune system and cancer. Here, we describe a system to introduce exogenous antigens into genetically engineered mouse lung cancers to mimic tumor neoantigens. We show that endogenous T cells respond to and infiltrate tumors, significantly delaying malignant progression. Despite continued antigen expression, T cell infiltration does not persist and tumors ultimately escape immune attack. Transplantation of cell lines derived from these lung tumors or prophylactic vaccination against the autochthonous tumors, however, results in rapid tumor eradication or selection of tumors that lose antigen expression. These results provide insight into the dynamic nature of the immune response to naturally arising tumors.

Abstract: Summary
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated when the AMP/ATP ratio in cells is elevated due to energy stress. Here, we describe a biosensor, AMPKAR, that exhibits enhanced fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in response to phosphorylation by AMPK, allowing spatiotemporal monitoring of AMPK activity in single cells. We show that this reporter responds to a variety of stimuli that are known to induce energy stress and that the response is dependent on AMPK α1 and α2 and on the upstream kinase LKB1. Interestingly, we found that AMPK activation is confined to the cytosol in response to energy stress but can be observed in both the cytosol and nucleus in response to calcium elevation. Finally, using this probe with U2OS cells in a microfluidic device, we observed a very high cell-to-cell variability in the amplitude and time course of AMPK activation and recovery in response to pulses of glucose deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
The Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor restrains cell growth and tumorigenesis by controlling contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation. We have identified a tight-junction-associated protein complex comprising Merlin, Angiomotin, Patj, and Pals1. We demonstrate that Angiomotin functions downstream of Merlin and upstream of Rich1, a small GTPase Activating Protein, as a positive regulator of Rac1. Merlin, through competitive binding to Angiomotin, releases Rich1 from the Angiomotin-inhibitory complex, allowing Rich1 to inactivate Rac1, ultimately leading to attenuation of Rac1 and Ras-MAPK pathways. Patient-derived Merlin mutants show diminished binding capacities to Angiomotin and are unable to dissociate Rich1 from Angiomotin or inhibit MAPK signaling. Depletion of Angiomotin in Nf2−/− Schwann cells attenuates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, impedes cellular proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Escherichia coli (E. coli) mazEF is a toxin-antitoxin (TA) stress-induced module that mediates cell death requiring the quorum-sensing pentapeptide NNWNN designated EDF (extracellular death factor). E. coli toxin MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease cleaving single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences. E. coli ChpBK, a toxin homologous to MazF, is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease cleaving single-stranded mRNAs at ACA, ACG, and ACU sequences. Here we report that, in vitro, the signaling molecule EDF significantly amplifies the endoribonucleolytic activities of both MazF and ChpBK. EDF also overcomes the inhibitory activity of the antitoxins MazE over the toxin MazF and ChpBI over ChpBK. EDF sequence is important for both functions. Moreover, direct sequence-specific binding of EDF to MazF has been confirmed. Peptide-protein modeling revealed parallel contacts between EDF-MazF and MazE-MazF. These findings are intriguing, since most known quorum-sensing molecules monitor gene expression on the transcriptional level, while EDF monitors posttranscriptionally.

Abstract: The study analyzed the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on the ultrastructure of the lining epithelium of the hard palatine mucosa of rats UChA and UChB (lines with voluntary alcohol consumption) in order to contribute to the understanding of the consequences of alcohol abuse for the morphology of the digestive system. Thirty female adult animals aged 120 days were divided into three experimental groups. (1) Ten UChA rats (genetically low ethanol consumer) with voluntary intake of 10% v/v (5.45g/kg/day) ethanol solution and water. (2) Ten UChB (genetically high ethanol consumer) rats with voluntary intake of 10% v/v (7.16g/kg/day) ethanol solution and water. (3) Ten Wistar rats with voluntary ad libitum water intake (control group). Both groups received Nuvital pellets ad libitum. The IGFR-I expression was intense in both experimental groups. The epithelial cells of the alcoholic rats UChA and UChB showed many alterations such as the presence of lipid droplets, altered nuclei, nuclei in corneum layer and disrupted mitochondria. It was concluded that ethanol intake induces ultrastructural lesions in the hard palatine mucosa.

Abstract: Caffeine is the most commonly ingested methylxanthine and has anti-cancer effects in several types of cancer. In this study, we examined the anti-cancer effects of caffeine on gliomas, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, caffeine treatment reduced glioma cell proliferation through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest by suppressing Rb phosphorylation. In addition, caffeine induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Caffeine also phosphorylated serine 9 of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). Pretreatment with H89, a pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), was able to antagonize caffeine-induced GSK3βser9 phosphorylation, suggesting that the mechanism might involve a cAMP-dependent PKA-dependent pathway. In vivo, caffeine-treated tumors exhibited reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated tumors. These results suggest that caffeine induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent cell death in glioma cells, supporting its potential use in chemotherapeutic options for malignant gliomas.

Abstract: To investigate the effects of open dentinal tubules on the morphological and functional characteristics of dental pulp cells. Morphological changes in human dental pulp cells that were seeded onto dentin discs with open dentinal tubules were investigated on days 1, 2, 4, and 10 of culture using scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Samples collected on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10 of culture were evaluated for cell proliferation rate and alkaline phosphatase activity. Cultured human dental pulp cells developed a columnar or polygonal morphology and monopolar cytoplasmic processes that extended into the dentinal tubules. The cells formed a multilayer and secreted an extracellular matrix onto the cell surface. Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy revealed polarized organization of odontoblasts. Cells seeded onto dentin discs proliferated minimally but showed high levels of ALP activity. Dental pulp cells seeded onto treated dentin discs develop an odontoblastlike phenotype, which may be a potential alternative for use in experimental research on dentinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] plays a fundamental role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, precisely how PI(4,5)P2 metabolism is spatially and temporally regulated during membrane internalization and the functional consequences of endocytosis-coupled PI(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation remain to be explored. Using cell-free assays with liposomes of varying diameters, we show that the major synaptic phosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), acts with membrane curvature generators/sensors, such as the BAR protein endophilin, to preferentially remove PI(4,5)P2 from curved membranes as opposed to relatively flat ones. Moreover, in vivo recruitment of Synj1's inositol 5-phosphatase domain to endophilin-induced membrane tubules results in fragmentation and condensation of these structures largely in a dynamin-dependent fashion. Our study raises the possibility that geometry-based mechanisms may contribute to spatially restricting PI(4,5)P2 elimination during membrane internalization and suggests that the PI(4,5)P2-to-PI4P conversion achieved by Synj1 at sites of high curvature may cooperate with dynamin to achieve membrane fission.

Abstract: RING finger protein 2 (RNF2) contains a conserved N-terminal RING finger domain and functions as an E3 ligase. As a member of the Polycomb group family of proteins, RNF2 also represses a number of genes involved in development, differentiation, malignant transformation and cell cycle. Herein, using chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning, 33 RNF2-responding loci were identified in the genome of HEK293 human kidney cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that among them, 26 and 2 loci acted as a repressor and an activator, respectively. RNA interference revealed that the identified RNF2-responding sequences regulated the transcriptional activity of nearby promoters. This study may contribute to elucidating the mechanism underlying RNF2-mediated transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: IFE-1 is one of the five C. elegans homologs of eIF4E, which is the mRNA 5’cap-binding component of the translation initiation complex eIF4F. Depletion of IFE-1 causes defects in sperm, suggesting that IFE-1 regulates a subset of genes required for sperm functions. To further understand the molecular function of IFE-1, proteomic analysis was performed to search for sperm proteins that are down-regulated in ife-1(ok1978); fem-3(q20) mutants relative to the fem-3(q20) control. The fem-3(q20) mutant background was used because it only produces sperm at restrictive temperature. Total worm proteins were subjected to 2D-DIGE, and differentially expressed protein spots were further identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, GSP-3 and Major Sperm Proteins (MSPs) were found to be significantly down-regulated in the ife-1(ok1978) mutant. Moreover, RNAi of gsp-3 caused an ife-1-like phenotype. These results suggest that IFE-1 is required for efficient expression of some sperm-specific proteins, and the fertilization defect of ife-1 mutant is caused mainly by a reduced level of GSP-3.

LGN/mInsc and LGN/NuMA Complex Structures Suggest Distinct Functions in Asymmetric Cell Division for the Par3/mInsc/LGN and Gαi/LGN/NuMA Pathways,

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric cell division requires the establishment of cortical cell polarity and the orientation of the mitotic spindle along the axis of cell polarity. Evidence from invertebrates demonstrates that the Par3/Par6/aPKC and NuMA/LGN/Gαi complexes, which are thought to be physically linked by the adaptor protein mInscuteable (mInsc), play indispensable roles in this process. However, the molecular basis for the binding of LGN to NuMA and mInsc is poorly understood. The high-resolution structures of the LGN/NuMA and LGN/mInsc complexes presented here provide mechanistic insights into the distinct and highly specific interactions of the LGN TPRs with mInsc and NuMA. Structural comparisons, together with biochemical and cell biology studies, demonstrate that the interactions of NuMA and mInsc with LGN are mutually exclusive, with mInsc binding preferentially. Our results suggest that the Par3/mInsc/LGN and NuMA/LGN/Gαi complexes play sequential and partially overlapping roles in asymmetric cell division.

Abstract: 1.2.3.4.6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG), a polyphenolic compound isolated from Rhus chinensis Mill. PGG has been known to have anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic and anti-diabetic activities. The present study revealed another underlying molecular target of PGG in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by using Illumina Human Ref-8 expression BeadChip assay. Through the Beadstudio v3 micro assay program to compare the identified genes expressed in PGG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with untreated control, we found several unique genes that are closely associated with pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tyrosine metabolism, including PC, ACSS2, ACACA, ACYP2, ALDH3B1, FBP1, PRMT2 and COMT. Consistent with microarray data, real-time RT-PCR confirmed the significant down-regulation of these genes at mRNA level in PGG-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Our findings suggest the potential of PGG as anticancer agent for breast cancer cells by targeting cancer metabolism genes.

Abstract: Summary
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia, leading to simultaneous loss and gain of activities in the production of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), respectively. Here we demonstrate that 2-HG is a competitive inhibitor of multiple α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methlycytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. 2-HG occupies the same space as α-KG does in the active site of histone demethylases. Ectopic expression of tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants inhibits histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. In glioma, IDH1 mutations are associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC). Hence, tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduce α-KG and accumulate an α-KG antagonist, 2-HG, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA methylation alterations.

Abstract: Glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs) are the key anti-oxidant enzymes found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among the three Gpx isoforms, glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3) is ubiquitously expressed and modulates the activities of redox-sensitive thiol proteins involved in various biological reactions. By using a proteomic approach, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GAPDH2; EC 1.2.1.12) was found as a candidate protein for interaction with Gpx3. GAPDH, a key enzyme in glycolysis, is a multi-functional protein with multiple intracellular localizations and diverse activities. To validate the interaction between Gpx3 and GAPDH2, immunoprecipitation and a pull-down assay were carried out. The results clearly showed that GAPDH2 interacts with Gpx3 through its carboxyl-terminal domain both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Gpx3 helps to reduce the S-nitrosylation of GAPDH upon nitric oxide (NO) stress; this subsequently increases cellular viability. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that Gpx3 protects GAPDH from NO stress and thereby contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis during exposure to NO stress.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation plays a major role in DNA repair, where it regulates chromatin relaxation as one of the critical events in the repair process. However, the molecular mechanism by which poly(ADP-ribose) modulates chromatin remains poorly understood. Here we identify the poly(ADP-ribose)-regulated protein APLF as a DNA-damage-specific histone chaperone. APLF preferentially binds to the histone H3/H4 tetramer via its C-terminal acidic motif, which is homologous to the motif conserved in the histone chaperones of the NAP1L family (NAP1L motif). We further demonstrate that APLF exhibits histone chaperone activities in a manner that is dependent on its acidic domain and that the NAP1L motif is critical for the repair capacity of APLF in vivo. Finally, we identify structural analogs of APLF in lower eukaryotes with the ability to bind histones and localize to the sites of DNA-damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Collectively, these findings define the involvement of histone chaperones in poly(ADP-ribose)-regulated DNA repair reactions.

Abstract: Bradykinin and its related peptides are widely distributed in venomous animals, including scorpion. A peptide fraction isolated from the venom of the Egyptian scorpion Buthus occitanus was proved to have a bradykinin-potentiating activity. The aim of the present study was conducted to investigate whether the treatment with bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) offers more beneficial effects in reversing cadmium-induced oxidative stress in rat liver and kidney. Adult male rats, equally divided into control and two treated groups, 10 animals in each group. group (I) was orally given (1ml) saline and served as a control group; group (II) of rats was given cadmium chloride (4mg/kg) alone, once daily an oral dose for 7 successive days; group (III) of rats was given ip injection (1ml) BPF, once daily a dose for 7 successive days prior to CdCl2 treatment and on the next 7 successive days with the same dose of cadmium as group II. Both organs were subjected to histopathological analysis with the light microscope. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), asparate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in serum were measured as indicators of the liver function. As parameters of the kidney function, creatinine, uric acid and urea concentrations in serum were determined. Also, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), super oxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined in both tissues. Cd exposure caused a significant decrease or inhibition in the activities of GSH, SOD, and CAT, with significant increase in the level of MDA, in versus to control groups in both liver and kidney. Also, when Cd was treated in co-administration with BPF induced increase or stimulation in the activity of GSH, SOD, and CAT, with significant decrease in the level of MDA when compared to Cd group in both organs. Histopathological changes of liver and kidney were also in accordance with the biochemical findings. Our data showed that Cd treatment induced histopathological alteration in the liver, severe hydropic degeneration in centrolobular zones. Inflammatory cells infiltration around the congested central vein and an obvious injury in some renal tubules. Bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) administration prevented the histopathological alterations which observed in Cd-groups and both liver and kidney had essentially normal appearance in histopathological examination. In conclusion, BPF markedly ameliorated cadmium-induced liver and kidney tissue damage as evidenced by histological and biochemical examinations and acts as a potent scavenger of free radicals to protect the liver and kidney against the deleterious effect of acute cadmium intoxication.

Abstract: To compare the differences in MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA among four colon cancer cell lines and to identify the best in vitro models for studying mucin expression, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA in Caco-2, HT29, LoVo, and LS174T cell lines. The levels of MUC2 mRNA expression in the four colon cancer cell lines ranked in order of mRNA abundance were: LS174T>LoVo>HT-29>Caco-2. In contrast to MUC2, the abundances of MUC5AC mRNA were in the order: Caco-2>HT-29>LS174T>LoVo. Caco-2 (highest level of MUC5AC mRNA) and LS174T (highest level of MUC2 mRNA) were used to investigate the phenotypes. Morphologically, Caco-2 cells were larger with low electron density mucus-storing vacuoles, many cell surface microvilli, and no obvious intercellular spaces between cells, compared to LS174T cells. The proliferative and invasive capacities of LS174T cells were significantly higher than those of Caco-2 cells.

Abstract: Recently, human neonatal thymus-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (nTMSCs) have been recognized as a promising mesenchymal stem cell source for combined cell and gene therapy. While efficient gene transfer is crucial for optimizing therapeutic efficacy, almost no studies have yet reported on the characteristics of nTMSC in terms of genetic modification. The present study investigates and realizes the potential of self-complementary adeno-associated viruses (scAAVs) as an effective transduction tool for nTMSCs. Transduction efficiency (TE), cytotoxicity and functional characteristics were determined in nTMSCs isolated from thymic tissues and transduced with scAAV1-6 and -8 serotypes expressing GFP. Our study confirms MSC-typical characteristics in nTMSCs and additionally, suggests further therapeutic advantages of nTMSCs due to its particularities with lower levels of MHC class I protein and higher levels of CD31 and CD34 expression. Effective transduction by scAAV2 and scAAV5 was evident in the majority of nTMSCs that were GFP-positive at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1000. TE was further improved by higher MOI treatments. Transduced cells also successfully maintained adipocyte and vessel-forming endothelial cell multi-potency and showed no evidence of gene delivery-related cytotoxicity. Collectively, the data strongly suggest that scAAVs are promising technical platforms for safe and effective transgene expression in nTMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosome duplication occurs once per cell cycle and ensures that the two resulting centrosomes assemble a bipolar mitotic spindle. Centriole formation is fundamental for centrosome duplication. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the evolutionarily conserved proteins SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-6, SAS-5, and SAS-4 are essential for centriole formation, but how they function is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is also critical for centriole formation in C. elegans embryos. We find that PP2A subunits genetically and physically interact with the SAS-5/SAS-6 complex. Furthermore, we show that PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation promotes centriolar targeting of SAS-5 and ensures SAS-6 delivery to the site of centriole assembly. We find that PP2A is similarly needed for the presence of HsSAS-6 at centrioles and for centriole formation in human cells. These findings lead us to propose that PP2A-mediated loading of SAS-6 proteins is critical at the onset of centriole formation.

Abstract: Summary
There is growing evidence that intestinal bacteria are important beneficial partners of their metazoan hosts. Recent observations suggest a strong link between commensal bacteria, host energy metabolism, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. As a consequence, the gut microbiota is now considered a “host” factor that influences energy uptake. However, the impact of intestinal bacteria on other systemic physiological parameters still remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila microbiota promotes larval growth upon nutrient scarcity. We reveal that Lactobacillus plantarum, a commensal bacterium of the Drosophila intestine, is sufficient on its own to recapitulate the natural microbiota growth-promoting effect. L. plantarum exerts its benefit by acting genetically upstream of the TOR-dependent host nutrient sensing system controlling hormonal growth signaling. Our results indicate that the intestinal microbiota should also be envisaged as a factor that influences the systemic growth of its host.

Ultrasensitivity in the Regulation of Cdc25C by Cdk1,

Abstract: Summary
Cdc25C is a critical component of the interlinked positive and double-negative feedback loops that constitute the bistable mitotic trigger. Computational studies have indicated that the trigger's bistability should be more robust if the individual legs of the loops exhibit ultrasensitive responses. Here, we show that in Xenopus extracts two measures of Cdc25C activation (hyperphosphorylation and Ser 287 dephosphorylation) are highly ultrasensitive functions of the Cdk1 activity; estimated Hill coefficients were 11 to 32. Some of Cdc25C's ultrasensitivity can be reconstituted in vitro with purified components, and the reconstituted ultrasensitivity depends upon multisite phosphorylation. The response functions determined here for Cdc25C and previously for Wee1A allow us to formulate a simple mathematical model of the transition between interphase and mitosis. The model shows how the continuously variable regulators of mitosis work collectively to generate a switch-like, hysteretic response.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that exists in two separate complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that function to control cell size and growth in response to growth factors, nutrients, and cellular energy levels. Low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of the Rheb and Rag families are key regulators of the mTORC1 complex, but regulation of mTORC2 is poorly understood. Here, we report that Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, is a critical regulator of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 in response to growth-factor stimulation. Deletion of Rac1 in primary cells using an inducible-Cre/Lox approach inhibits basal and growth-factor activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Rac1 appears to bind directly to mTOR and to mediate mTORC1 and mTORC2 localization at specific membranes. Binding of Rac1 to mTOR does not depend on the GTP-bound state of Rac1, but on the integrity of its C-terminal domain. This function of Rac1 provides a means to regulate mTORC1 and mTORC2 simultaneously.

Abstract: Summary
In vertebrate embryos, retinoic acid (RA) synthesized in the mesoderm by Raldh2 emanates to the hindbrain neuroepithelium, where it induces anteroposterior (AP)-restricted Hox expression patterns and rhombomere segmentation. However, how appropriate spatiotemporal RA activity is generated in the hindbrain is poorly understood. By analyzing Pbx1/Pbx2 and Hoxa1/Pbx1 null mice, we found that Raldh2 is itself under the transcriptional control of these factors and that the resulting RA-deficient phenotypes can be partially rescued by exogenous RA. Hoxa1-Pbx1/2-Meis2 directly binds a specific regulatory element that is required to maintain normal Raldh2 expression levels in vivo. Mesoderm-specific Xhoxa1 and Xpbx1b knockdowns in Xenopus embryos also result in Xraldh2 downregulation and hindbrain defects similar to mouse mutants, demonstrating conservation of this Hox-Pbx-dependent regulatory pathway. These findings reveal a feed-forward mechanism linking Hox-Pbx-dependent RA synthesis during early axial patterning with the establishment of spatially restricted Hox-Pbx activity in the developing hindbrain.

Abstract: Summary
IKK-related kinases are key regulators of innate immunity and oncogenesis. While their effects on transcription are well characterized, their cytoplasmic functions remain poorly understood. Drosophila IKK-related kinase, IKKɛ, regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell elongation. Here, we demonstrate that IKKɛ is activated locally at the tip of growing mechanosensory bristles and regulates the rapid shuttling of recycling endosomes, independent of its roles in F-actin organization and caspase signaling. IKKɛ regulates the localization of recycling endosome regulators Rab11 and Dynein and phosphorylates their adaptor molecule, Nuclear fallout (Nuf). Nuf's negative regulation by IKKɛ suggests that local activation of IKKɛ inhibits Dynein on incoming recycling endosomes, converting them for outward transport. Mammalian IKK-related kinases also regulate the recycling endosomes' distribution by phosphorylating the Nuf homolog Rab11-FIP3. Our results establish an evolutionarily conserved function of IKK-related kinases in regulating recycling endosome dynamics and point to a key role of endosome dynamics in cell morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The development of resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for lasting effective treatment of cancer. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) become activated during treatment with platinum analogs and secrete factors that protect tumor cells against a range of chemotherapeutics. Through a metabolomics approach, we identified two distinct platinum-induced polyunsaturated fatty acids (PIFAs), 12-oxo-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (KHT) and hexadeca-4,7,10,13-tetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)), that in minute quantities induce resistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, blocking central enzymes involved in the production of these PIFAs (cyclooxygenase-1 and thromboxane synthase) prevents MSC-induced resistance. Our findings show that MSCs are potent mediators of resistance to chemotherapy and reveal targets to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in patients.

Abstract: Summary
In the course of a day, the Neurospora clock protein FREQUENCY (FRQ) is progressively phosphorylated at up to 113 sites and eventually degraded. Phosphorylation and degradation are crucial for circadian time keeping, but it is not known how phosphorylation of a large number of sites correlates with circadian degradation of FRQ. We show that two amphipathic motifs in FRQ interact over a long distance, bringing the positively charged N-terminal portion in spatial proximity to the negatively charged middle and C-terminal portion of FRQ. The interaction is essential for the recruitment of casein kinase 1a (CK1a) into a stable complex with FRQ. FRQ-bound CK1a progressively phosphorylates the positively charged N-terminal domain of FRQ at up to 46 nonconsensus sites, triggering a conformational change, presumably by electrostatic repulsion, that commits the protein for degradation via the PEST1 signal in the negatively charged central portion of FRQ.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the lung neoplasia with the poorest prognosis, due to its high metastatic potential and chemoresistance upon relapse. Using the previously described mouse model for SCLC, we found that the tumors are often composed of phenotypically different cells with either a neuroendocrine or a mesenchymal marker profile. These cells had a common origin because they shared specific genomic aberrations. The transition from neuroendocrine to mesenchymal phenotype could be achieved by the ectopic expression of oncogenic RasV12. Crosstalk between mesenchymal and neuroendocrine cells strongly influenced their behavior. When engrafted as a mixed population, the mesenchymal cells endowed the neuroendocrine cells with metastatic capacity, illustrating the potential relevance of tumor cell heterogeneity in dictating tumor properties.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumors is modulated by negative feedback, including mTORC1-mediated inhibition of upstream signaling. We now show that AKT inhibition induces the expression and phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In a wide spectrum of tumor types, inhibition of AKT induces a conserved set of RTKs, including HER3, IGF-1R, and insulin receptor. This is in part due to mTORC1 inhibition and in part secondary to a FOXO-dependent activation of receptor expression. PI3K-AKT inhibitors relieve this feedback and activate RTK signaling; this may attenuate their antitumor activity. Consistent with this model, we find that, in tumors in which AKT suppresses HER3 expression, combined inhibition of AKT and HER kinase activity is more effective than either alone.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin impacts various nuclear processes by providing a recruiting platform for diverse chromosomal proteins. In fission yeast, HP1 proteins Chp2 and Swi6, which bind to methylated histone H3 lysine 9, associate with SHREC (Snf2/HDAC repressor complex) and Clr6 histone deacetylases (HDACs) involved in heterochromatic silencing. However, heterochromatic silencing machinery is not fully defined. We describe a histone chaperone complex containing Asf1 and HIRA that spreads across silenced domains via its association with Swi6 to enforce transcriptional silencing. Asf1 functions in concert with a Clr6 HDAC complex to silence heterochromatic repeats, and it suppresses antisense transcription by promoting histone deacetylation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Asf1 and SHREC facilitate nucleosome occupancy at heterochromatic regions but TFIIIC transcription factor binding sites within boundary elements are refractory to these factors. These analyses uncover a role for Asf1 in global histone deacetylation and suggest that HP1-associated histone chaperone promotes nucleosome occupancy to assemble repressive heterochromatin.

Abstract: Scratch (scrt) genes are neural-specific in mammals, but their homologues have not been well studied in nonmammalian vertebrates. In this report, we isolated three zebrafish scrt genes, scratchla (scrtla), scratchlb (scrtlb),and scratch2 (scrt2), which belong to the Snail superfamily of zinc finger transcription factors. Spatiotemporal expression analysis revealed that scrtla and scrt2 were initially detected in the central nervous system (CNS) during early somitogenesis while scrtlb was first detectable in neuronal clusters in the brain during late somitogenesis. Interestingly, scrt-expressing cells largely overlapped with huC-positive differentiating neurons and partially with neurogeninl-positive neuronal precursor cells. In addition, scrt-expressing cells were dramatically increased in mind bomb, a neurogenic mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that each zebrafish scrt gene is specifically expressed in neuronal cells and may be involved in differentiation of distinct neuronal populations in the vertebrate nervous system.

Abstract: An in vitro system of isolated skin cells has been developed in order to address the understanding on the factors that control the shedding cycle and differentiation of lizard epidermis. The skin from the regenerating lizard tail has been separated in epidermis and dermis, cells have been dissociated, cultivated in vitro, and studied ultrastructurally after 1–30 days of culture condition. Dissociated keratinocytes after 12 days in culture show numerous cell elongations and contain bundles of keratin or sparse keratin filaments. These cells often contain one to three 0.5–3μm large and dense “keratinaceous bodies”, an organelle representing tonofilament disassembling. Most keratinocytes have sparse tonofilaments in the cytoplasm and form shorter bundles of keratin in the cell periphery. The dissociated dermis mainly consists of mesenchymal cells containing sparse bundles of intermediate filaments. These cells proliferate and form multi-stratified layers and a dermal pellicle in about 2–3 weeks in vitro in our basic medium. Conversely, cultures of keratinocytes do not expand but eventually reduce to few viable cells within 2–3 weeks of in vitro condition. It is suggested that dermal cells sustain themselves through the production of growth factors but that epidermal cells requires specific growth factors still to be identified before setting-up an in vitro system that allows analyzing the control of the shedding cycle in lizards.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced expression of the Indy (I'm Not Dead, Yet) gene in D. melanogaster and its homolog in C. elegans prolongs life span and in D. melanogaster augments mitochondrial biogenesis in a manner akin to caloric restriction. However, the cellular mechanism by which Indy does this is unknown. Here, we report on the knockout mouse model of the mammalian Indy (mIndy) homolog, SLC13A5. Deletion of mIndy in mice (mINDY−/− mice) reduces hepatocellular ATP/ADP ratio, activates hepatic AMPK, induces PGC-1α, inhibits ACC-2, and reduces SREBP-1c levels. This signaling network promotes hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure and attenuates hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Together, these traits protect mINDY−/− mice from the adiposity and insulin resistance that evolve with high-fat feeding and aging. Our studies demonstrate a profound effect of mIndy on mammalian energy metabolism and suggest that mINDY might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
During ubiquitin conjugation, the thioester bond that links “donor” ubiquitin to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) undergoes nucleophilic attack by the ɛ-amino group of an acceptor lysine, resulting in formation of an isopeptide bond. Models of ubiquitination have envisioned the donor ubiquitin to be a passive participant in this process. However, we show here that the I44A mutation in ubiquitin profoundly inhibits its ability to serve as a donor for ubiquitin chain initiation or elongation, but can be rescued by computationally predicted compensatory mutations in the E2 Cdc34. The donor defect of ubiquitin-I44A can be partially suppressed either by using a low pKa amine (hydroxylamine) as the acceptor or by performing reactions at higher pH, suggesting that the discharge defect arises in part due to inefficient deprotonation of the acceptor lysine. We propose that interaction between Cdc34 and the donor ubiquitin organizes the active site to promote efficient ubiquitination of substrate.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage to the germline genome must be accurately repaired to ensure transmission of intact genetic information to following generations. Meiosis presents challenges to the DNA damage response (DDR) because it universally requires changes to chromosome structure that can affect DNA repair outcomes. We report the existence of a meiotic DDR at chromosome axes that results in chromatin remodeling, synaptonemal complex disassembly, and axis separation in response to irradiation at late pachytene stages in C. elegans. The axis component HTP-3 is required for germline acquisition of H2AacK5, an axis-specific chromatin mark that is DNA damage responsive. Irradiated wild-types show reduction of H2AacK5 and axis separation that are dependent on the acetyltransferase MYS-1/TIP60. Restoration of H2AacK5 levels requires ATM-1 kinase and correlates with resynapsis. We propose that the meiotic DDR involves early chromatin remodeling at chromosome axes to dismantle structures promoting interhomolog recombination and facilitate efficient nonhomolog-based repair before pachytene exit.

Abstract: Summary
Acetylation is increasingly recognized as an important metabolic regulatory posttranslational protein modification, yet the metabolic consequence of mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation is unknown. We find that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces hepatic mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation in mice and downregulation of the major mitochondrial protein deacetylase SIRT3. Mice lacking SIRT3 (SIRT3KO) placed on a HFD show accelerated obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and steatohepatitis compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is highly induced in SIRT3KO mice, and its deletion rescues both WT and SIRT3KO mice from HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We further identify a single nucleotide polymorphism in the human SIRT3 gene that is suggestive of a genetic association with the metabolic syndrome. This polymorphism encodes a point mutation in the SIRT3 protein, which reduces its overall enzymatic efficiency. Our findings show that loss of SIRT3 and dysregulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation contribute to the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking is a fundamental cellular process, but its developmental relevance is little understood. Here we show that the kinesin-3 motor KIF16B/Rab14 complex acts in biosynthetic Golgi-to-endosome traffic of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) during early embryonic development. Kif16b–/– mouse embryos failed in developing epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages and died in the peri-implantation stage, similar to previously reported FGFR2 knockout embryos. KIF16B associated directly with the Rab14-GTP adaptor on FGFR-containing vesicles and transported them toward the plasma membrane. To examine whether the nucleotide state of Rab14 serves as a switch for transport, we performed Rab14-GDP overexpression. This dominant negative approach reproduced the whole putative sequence of KIF16B or FGFR2 deficiency: impairment in FGFR transport, FGF signaling, basement membrane assembly by the primitive endoderm lineage, and epiblast development. These data provide one of the first pieces of genetic evidence that microtubule-based membrane trafficking directly promotes early development.

Abstract: Summary
Hundreds of different proteins regulate and implement transcription in Saccharomyces. Yet their interrelationships have not been investigated on a comprehensive scale. Here we determined the genome-wide binding locations of 200 transcription-related proteins, under normal and acute heat-shock conditions. This study distinguishes binding between distal versus proximal promoter regions as well as the 3′ ends of genes for nearly all mRNA and tRNA genes. This study reveals (1) a greater diversity and specialization of regulation associated with the SAGA transcription pathway compared to the TFIID pathway, (2) new regulators enriched at tRNA genes, (3) a global co-occupancy network of >20,000 unique regulator combinations that show a high degree of regulatory interconnections among lowly expressed genes, (4) regulators of the SAGA pathway located largely distal to the core promoter and regulators of the TFIID pathway located proximally, and (5) distinct mobilization of SAGA- versus TFIID-linked regulators during acute heat shock.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential molecular chaperone whose activity is regulated not only by cochaperones but also by distinct posttranslational modifications. We report here that casein kinase 2 phosphorylates a conserved threonine residue (T22) in α helix-1 of the yeast Hsp90 N-domain both in vitro and in vivo. This α helix participates in a hydrophobic interaction with the catalytic loop in Hsp90's middle domain, helping to stabilize the chaperone's ATPase-competent state. Phosphomimetic mutation of this residue alters Hsp90 ATPase activity and chaperone function and impacts interaction with the cochaperones Aha1 and Cdc37. Overexpression of Aha1 stimulates the ATPase activity, restores cochaperone interactions, and compensates for the functional defects of these Hsp90 mutants.

Abstract: Summary
In Escherichia coli, translocation of exported proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane is dependent on the motor protein SecA and typically begins only after synthesis of the substrate has already been completed (i.e., posttranslationally). Thus, it has generally been assumed that the translocation machinery also recognizes its protein substrates posttranslationally. Here we report a specific interaction between SecA and the ribosome at a site near the polypeptide exit channel. This interaction is mediated by conserved motifs in SecA and ribosomal protein L23, and partial disruption of this interaction in vivo by introducing mutations into the genes encoding SecA or L23 affects the efficiency of translocation by the posttranslational pathway. Based on these findings, we propose that SecA could interact with its nascent substrates during translation in order to efficiently channel them into the “posttranslational” translocation pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Robo4 is an endothelial cell-specific member of the Roundabout axon guidance receptor family. To identify Robo4 binding partners, we performed a protein-protein interaction screen with the Robo4 extracellular domain. We find that Robo4 specifically binds to UNC5B, a vascular Netrin receptor, revealing unexpected interactions between two endothelial guidance receptors. We show that Robo4 maintains vessel integrity by activating UNC5B, which inhibits signaling downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against Robo4 and UNC5B increase angiogenesis and disrupt vessel integrity. Soluble Robo4 protein inhibits VEGF-induced vessel permeability and rescues barrier defects in Robo4−/− mice, but not in mice treated with anti-UNC5B. Thus, Robo4-UNC5B signaling maintains vascular integrity by counteracting VEGF signaling in endothelial cells, identifying a novel function of guidance receptor interactions in the vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebrovascular dysfunction is strongly associated with neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and stroke in adults. Cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs) play important roles in maintaining a stable cerebral circulation in the central nervous system by interacting with pericytes. However, the genetic mechanisms controlling the functions of cerebral ECs are still largely unknown. Here, we report that disruption of Smad4, the central intracellular mediator of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, specifically in the cerebral ECs, results in perinatal ICH and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Furthermore, the mutant vessels exhibit defective mural cell coverage. Smad4 stabilizes cerebrovascular EC-pericyte interactions by regulating the transcription of N-cadherin through associating with the Notch intracellular complex at the RBP-J binding site of the N-cadherin promoter. These findings uncover a distinct role of endothelial Smad4 in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity and suggest important implications for genetic or functional deficiencies in TGF-β/Smad signaling in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from vegetative growth to flower formation is critical for the survival of flowering plants. The plant-specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) has central, evolutionarily conserved roles in this process, both in the formation of the first flower and later in floral patterning. We performed genome-wide binding and expression studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LFY executes these roles. Our study reveals that LFY directs an elaborate regulatory network in control of floral homeotic gene expression. LFY also controls the expression of genes that regulate the response to external stimuli in Arabidopsis. Thus, our findings support a key role for LFY in the coordination of reproductive stage development and disease response programs in plants that may ensure optimal allocation of plant resources for reproductive fitness. Finally, motif analyses reveal a possible mechanism for stage-specific LFY recruitment and suggest a role for LFY in overcoming polycomb repression.

Abstract: The retromer complex is a heteropentameric protein unit associated with retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. Functional silencing study of the Vps26a gene indicated the important role of the retromer complex during early developmental stages in the mouse. However, individual expression patterns and quantitative analysis of individual members of the retromer complex during the early developmental stages has not been investigated. In this study, we conducted quantitative expression analysis of six retromer complex genes (Vps26a, Vps26b, Vps29, Vps35, Snx1, and Snx2) and one related receptor gene (Ci-mpr) during the eleven embryonic stages with normal MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) and Vps26a-/- MEF cells. Remarkably, except for Vps26a (maternal expression pattern), all tested genes showed maternal-zygotic expression patterns. And five genes (Vps26b, Vps29, Vps35, Snx2, and Ci-mpr) showed a pattern of decreased expression in Vps26a-/- MEF cells by comparative analysis between normal MEF and Vps26a-/- MEF cells. However, the Snx1 gene showed a pattern of increased expression in Vps26a-/- MEF cells. From our results, we could assume that retromer complexrelated genes have important roles during oocyte development. However, in the preimplantation stage, they did not have significant roles.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic feeding on high-calorie diets causes obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), illnesses that affect hundreds of millions. Thus, understanding the pathways protecting against diet-induced metabolic imbalance is of paramount medical importance. Here, we show that mice lacking SIRT1 in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons are hypersensitive to dietary obesity owing to maladaptive energy expenditure. Also, mutant mice have increased susceptibility to developing dietary T2DM due to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, these aberrations arise, in part, from impaired metabolic actions of the neuropeptide orexin-A and the hormone leptin. Conversely, mice overexpressing SIRT1 in SF1 neurons are more resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to increased energy expenditure and enhanced skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Our results unveil important protective roles of SIRT1 in SF1 neurons against dietary metabolic imbalance.

Abstract: We studied how mitochondrial uncoupling by β3-adrenergic stimulation elicits Ca2+ signals in rodent brown adipocytes by fluorometry of Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i, [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]ER) in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively, and mitochondrial membrane potential, using fura-2, rhod-5N, cameleon and rhodamine 123. Immunoblotting demonstrated α1A- and β3-adrenergic receptor and UCP1 in adipocytes, while RT-PCR revealed the mRNA of type 3, 7 and 9 adenylate cyclase, UCP1, UCP2, UCP3 and type 1 and 2 inositoltrisphosphate receptors. Isoproterenol and BRL37344, β-agonist, caused triphasic rises in [Ca2+]i (β-responses) with mitochondrial depolarization in adipocytes. BRL37344 transiently decreased [Ca2+]m. β-Responses were blocked by propranolol, β-antagonist, H-89, protein kinase A blocker, and knockout of UCP1 gene. The late phase of β-responses was depressed by a Ca2+ free, EGTA solution, U73122, a phospholipase C blocker, and thapsigargin, ER-Ca2+ pump blocker, and by transfecting siRNA for type 2 IP3R. Intracellular loading of BAPTA/AM depressed the late phase more strongly than the initial phase. β-Agonists, phenylephrine, α-agonist, and cyclopiazonic acid, ER-Ca2+ pump blocker, decreased [Ca2+]ER. Thus, the mitochondrial uncoupling by β3-adrenergic activation causes Ca2+ release from mitochondria and subsequently from the ER and further evokes plasmalemmal Ca2+ entries, including the store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Abstract: Summary
In response to environmental stresses, cells activate stress-response genes and inhibit DNA replication. HBO1 histone acetylase is a coactivator both for AP-1 transcription factors responding to stress-activated JNK kinases and also for the Cdt1 licensing factor that ensures that DNA is replicated exactly once per cell cycle. In response to nongenotoxic stress, JNK phosphorylates Jun, an AP-1 transcription factor, leading to increased recruitment of HBO1 and increased transcription of target genes. In addition, JNK phosphorylates Cdt1 on threonine 29, leading to rapid dissociation of HBO1 from replication origins, thereby blocking initiation of DNA replication. Upon relief of stress, HBO1 reassociates with replication origins. Thus, regulated and reciprocal recruitment of the HBO1 coactivator to target genes and replication origins via JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the recruiting transcription and replication licensing factors coordinates the transcriptional and DNA replication response to cellular stress.

Abstract: Cyclic AMP regulates the late step of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in many secretory cells through two major mechanisms: a protein kinase A-dependent and a cAMP-GEF/Epac-dependent pathway. We designed a protocol to characterize the role of these two cAMP-dependent pathways on the Ca2+ sensitivity and kinetics of regulated exocytosis in mouse pancreatic beta cells, using a whole-cell patch-clamp based capacitance measurements. A train of depolarizing pulses or slow photo-release of caged Ca2+ were stimuli for the exocytotic activity. In controls, due to exocytosis after slow photo-release, the Cm change had typically two phases. We observed that the Ca2+-dependency of the rate of the first Cm change follows saturation kinetics with high cooperativity and half-maximal rate at 2.9±0.2μM. The intracellular depletion of cAMP did not change amp1, while rate1 and amp2 were strongly reduced. This manipulation pushed the Ca2+-dependency of the exocytotic burst to significantly lower [Ca2+]i. To address the question of which of the cAMP-dependent mechanisms regulates the observed shifts in Ca2+ dependency we included regulators of PKA and Epac2 activity in the pipette solution. PKA activation with 100μM 6-Phe-cAMP or inhibition with 500μM Rp-cAMPs in beta cells significantly shifted the EC50 in the opposite directions. Specific activation of Epac2 did not change Ca2+ sensitivity. Our findings suggest that cAMP modulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in mouse beta cells mainly through a PKA-dependent mechanism by sensitizing the insulin releasing machinery to [Ca2+]i; Epac2 may contribute to enhance the rates of secretory vesicle fusion.

Abstract: Summary
The majority of trypanosomal mitochondrial pre-mRNAs undergo massive uridine insertion/deletion editing, which creates open reading frames. Although the pre-editing addition of short 3′ A tails is known to stabilize transcripts during and after the editing, the processing event committing the fully edited mRNAs to translation remained unknown. Here, we show that a heterodimer of pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (PPR) proteins, termed kinetoplast polyadenylation/uridylation factors (KPAFs) 1 and 2, induces the postediting addition of A/U heteropolymers by KPAP1 poly(A) polymerase and RET1 terminal uridyltransferase. Edited transcripts bearing 200- to 300-nucleotide-long A/U tails, but not short A tails, were enriched in translating ribosomal complexes and affinity-purified ribosomal particles. KPAF1 repression led to a selective loss of A/U-tailed mRNAs and concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis. These results establish A/U extensions as the defining cis-elements of translation-competent mRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that A/U-tailed mRNA preferentially interacts with the small ribosomal subunit, whereas edited substrates and complexes bind to the large subunit.

Abstract: Summary
The trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) are committed and marked by reciprocal expression of Cdx2 and Oct4 in mouse late blastocysts. We find that the TE is not committed at equivalent stages in cattle, and that bovine Cdx2 is required later, for TE maintenance, but does not repress Oct4 expression. A mouse Oct4 (mOct4) reporter, repressed in mouse TE, remained active in the cattle TE; bovine Oct4 constructs were not repressed in the mouse TE. mOct4 has acquired Tcfap2 binding sites mediating Cdx2-independent repression—cattle, humans, and rabbits do not contain these sites and maintain high Oct4 levels in the TE. Our data suggest that the regulatory circuitry determining ICM/TE identity has been rewired in mice, to allow rapid TE differentiation and early blastocyst implantation. These findings thus emphasize ways in which mice may not be representative of the earliest stages of mammalian development and stem cell biology.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in both RAS and the PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT signaling module are found in the same human tumors. PIK3CA and AKT are downstream effectors of RAS, and the selective advantage conferred by mutation of two genes in the same pathway is unclear. Based on a comparative molecular analysis, we show that activated PIK3CA/AKT is a weaker inducer of senescence than is activated RAS. Moreover, concurrent activation of RAS and PIK3CA/AKT impairs RAS-induced senescence. In vivo, bypass of RAS-induced senescence by activated PIK3CA/AKT correlates with accelerated tumorigenesis. Thus, not all oncogenes are equally potent inducers of senescence, and, paradoxically, a weak inducer of senescence (PIK3CA/AKT) can be dominant over a strong inducer of senescence (RAS). For tumor growth, one selective advantage of concurrent mutation of RAS and PTEN/PIK3CA/AKT is suppression of RAS-induced senescence. Evidence is presented that this new understanding can be exploited in rational development and targeted application of prosenescence cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila Discs large (Dlg) scaffolding protein acts as a tumor suppressor regulating basolateral epithelial polarity and proliferation. In mammals, four Dlg homologs have been identified; however, their functions in cell polarity remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the X-linked mental retardation gene product Dlg3 contributes to apical-basal polarity and epithelial junction formation in mouse organizer tissues, as well as to planar cell polarity in the inner ear. We purified complexes associated with Dlg3 in polarized epithelial cells, including proteins regulating directed trafficking and tight junction formation. Remarkably, of the four Dlg family members, Dlg3 exerts a distinct function by recruiting the ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 through its PPxY motifs. We found that these interactions are required for Dlg3 monoubiquitination, apical membrane recruitment, and tight junction consolidation. Our findings reveal an unexpected evolutionary diversification of the vertebrate Dlg family in basolateral epithelium formation.

Abstract: Summary
Upf1 is a crucial factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the eukaryotic surveillance pathway that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons. The essential RNA-dependent ATPase activity of Upf1 is triggered by the formation of the surveillance complex with Upf2-Upf3. We report crystal structures of Upf1 in the presence and absence of the CH domain, captured in the transition state with ADP:AlF4− and RNA. In isolation, Upf1 clamps onto the RNA, enclosing it in a channel formed by both the catalytic and regulatory domains. Upon binding to Upf2, the regulatory CH domain of Upf1 undergoes a large conformational change, causing the catalytic helicase domain to bind RNA less extensively and triggering its helicase activity. Formation of the surveillance complex thus modifies the RNA binding properties and the catalytic activity of Upf1, causing it to switch from an RNA-clamping mode to an RNA-unwinding mode.

Abstract: Various animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD) are characterized by deficits in spatial memory that are causally related to altered synaptic function and impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. In Tg2576 AD mice, we compared LTP in 2 major hippocampal pathways, Schaffer collateral (SC) and mossy fiber (MF) pathways. Whereas LTP was completely abolished in the SC pathway of Tg2576 mice, we found no decrease in LTP induced by stimulation of the MF pathway. In fact, we found that in the MF pathway, LTP was slightly, but significantly, enhanced compared with that in the MF pathway of WT littermates. This pathway-specific impairment of LTP is not attributable to alterations in transmitter release, as indicated by an unaltered paired-pulse ratio. These results suggest that the spatial memory deficits normally seen in AD models arise primarily from LTP impairment at the SC pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is frequently coupled to transcription by RNA polymerase II. Although this coupling is known to involve interactions with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit, the possible role of other factors is not known. Here we show that a prototypical transcriptional activator, GAL4-VP16, stimulates transcription-coupled polyadenylation in vitro. In the absence of GAL4-VP16, specifically initiated transcripts accumulated but little polyadenylation was observed, while in its presence polyadenylation was strongly enhanced. We further show that this stimulation requires the transcription elongation-associated PAF complex (PAF1c), as PAF1c depletion blocked GAL4-VP16-stimulated polyadenylation. Furthermore, knockdown of PAF subunits by siRNA resulted in decreased 3′ cleavage, and nuclear export, of mRNA in vivo. Finally, we show that GAL4-VP16 interacts directly with PAF1c and recruits it to DNA templates. Our results indicate that a transcription activator can stimulate transcription-coupled 3′ processing and does so via interaction with PAF1c.

Abstract: Summary
The C. elegans vulva is patterned by epidermal growth factor (EGF) activation of Ras to control 1° fate, and 1° fate induces antagonistic Notch-dependent 2° fate. Furthermore, a spatial EGF gradient, in addition to inducing 1° fate, directly contributes to 2° fate via an unknown pathway. We find that in addition to its canonical effector, Raf, vulval Ras utilizes an exchange factor for the Ral small GTPase (RalGEF), such that Ras-RalGEF-Ral antagonizes Ras-Raf pro-1° fate activity. Consistent with its restricted expression pattern, Ral participates in EGF pro-2° activity. Thus, we have delineated a Ras effector-switching mechanism whereby position within the morphogen gradient dictates that Ras effector usage is switched to RalGEF from Raf to promote 2° instead of 1° fate. Our observations define the utility of Ras effector switching during normal development and may provide a possible mechanistic basis for cell and cancer-type differences in effector dependency and activation.

Abstract: Summary
Liprins are highly conserved scaffold proteins that regulate cell adhesion, cell migration, and synapse development by binding to diverse target proteins. The molecular basis governing liprin/target interactions is poorly understood. The liprin-α2/CASK complex structure solved here reveals that the three SAM domains of liprin-α form an integrated supramodule that binds to the CASK kinase-like domain. As supported by biochemical and cellular studies, the interaction between liprin-α and CASK is unique to vertebrates, implying that the liprin-α/CASK interaction is likely to regulate higher-order brain functions in mammals. Consistently, we demonstrate that three recently identified X-linked mental retardation mutants of CASK are defective in binding to liprin-α. We also solved the liprin-α/liprin-β SAM domain complex structure, which uncovers the mechanism underlying liprin heterodimerizaion. Finally, formation of the CASK/liprin-α/liprin-β ternary complex suggests that liprins can mediate assembly of target proteins into large protein complexes capable of regulating numerous cellular activities.

Abstract: Summary
Histone chaperones physically interact with histones to direct proper assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes regulating diverse nuclear processes such as DNA replication, promoter remodeling, transcription elongation, DNA damage, and histone variant exchange. Currently, the best-characterized chaperone-histone interaction is that between the ubiquitous chaperone Asf1 and a dimer of H3 and H4. Nucleosome assembly proteins (Nap proteins) represent a distinct class of histone chaperone. Using pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) measurements and protein crosslinking, we show that two members of this class, Nap1 and Vps75, bind histones in the tetrameric conformation also observed when they are sequestered within the nucleosome. Furthermore, H3 and H4 trapped in their tetrameric state can be used as substrates in nucleosome assembly and chaperone-mediated lysine acetylation. This alternate mode of histone interaction provides a potential means of maintaining the integrity of the histone tetramer during cycles of nucleosome reassembly.

Abstract: Summary
Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) contribute to cancer progression, but their precise origin and role are unclear. Using mouse models of inflammation-induced gastric cancer, we show that at least 20% of CAFs originate from bone marrow (BM) and derive from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). αSMA+ myofibroblasts (MFs) are niche cells normally present in BM and increase markedly during cancer progression. MSC-derived CAFs that are recruited to the dysplastic stomach express IL-6, Wnt5α and BMP4, show DNA hypomethylation, and promote tumor growth. Moreover, CAFs are generated from MSCs and are recruited to the tumor in a TGF-β- and SDF-1α-dependent manner. Therefore, carcinogenesis involves expansion and relocation of BM-niche cells to the tumor to create a niche to sustain cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies revealed a surprising regenerative capacity of insulin-producing β cells in mice, suggesting that regenerative therapy for human diabetes could in principle be achieved. Physiologic β cell regeneration under stressed conditions relies on accelerated proliferation of surviving β cells, but the factors that trigger and control this response remain unclear. Using islet transplantation experiments, we show that β cell mass is controlled systemically rather than by local factors such as tissue damage. Chronic changes in β cell glucose metabolism, rather than blood glucose levels per se, are the main positive regulator of basal and compensatory β cell proliferation in vivo. Intracellularly, genetic and pharmacologic manipulations reveal that glucose induces β cell replication via metabolism by glucokinase, the first step of glycolysis, followed by closure of KATP channels and membrane depolarization. Our data provide a molecular mechanism for homeostatic control of β cell mass by metabolic demand.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH), drives a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis in FH-deficient kidney tumors and cell lines from patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer (HLRCC), resulting in decreased levels of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and p53 tumor suppressor, and activation of the anabolic factors, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ribosomal protein S6. Reduced AMPK levels lead to diminished expression of the DMT1 iron transporter, and the resulting cytosolic iron deficiency activates the iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, and increases expression of the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α. Silencing of HIF-1α or activation of AMPK diminishes invasive activities, indicating that alterations of HIF-1α and AMPK contribute to the oncogenic growth of FH-deficient cells.

Abstract: Summary
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is an ER quality-control process that eliminates terminally misfolded proteins. ERdj5 was recently discovered to be a key ER-resident PDI family member protein that accelerates ERAD by reducing incorrect disulfide bonds in misfolded glycoproteins recognized by EDEM1. We here solved the crystal structure of full-length ERdj5, thereby revealing that ERdj5 contains the N-terminal J domain and six tandem thioredoxin domains that can be divided into the N- and C-terminal clusters. Our systematic biochemical analyses indicated that two thioredoxin domains that constitute the C-terminal cluster form the highly reducing platform that interacts with EDEM1 and reduces EDEM1-recruited substrates, leading to their facilitated degradation. The pulse-chase experiment further provided direct evidence for the sequential movement of an ERAD substrate from calnexin to the downstream EDEM1-ERdj5 complex, and then to the retrotranslocation channel, probably through BiP. We present a detailed molecular view of how ERdj5 mediates ERAD in concert with EDEM1.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression primarily by translational repression or by messenger RNA degradation. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in various biological processes. However, little is known regarding their role in obesity. We investigated differences of microRNA (miRNA) expression in liver tissue from diet-induced obese mice and potential effects of them on gene and protein expression. We used a miRNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR to determine miRNA expression in murine liver tissue. Gene and protein expression were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Effects of miRNA by knock-down using RNAi or overexpression on putative target genes and/or proteins in a murine hepatic cell line were also investigated. MicroRNA array and qRT-PCR analsysis revealed that > 50 miRNAs were down- or upregulated more than 2-fold in the liver of diet-induced obese mice. While changes in expression of many genes were observed at the mRNA level, some were only altered at the protein level. Overexpression or knock-down of miR-107 in murine hepatic cells revealed that the expression of its putative target, fatty acid synthase, was dramatically decreased or increased, respectively. In conclusion, more than 50 hepatic miRNAs were dysregulated in diet-induced obese mice. Some of them regulate protein expression at translation level and others regulate mRNA expression at transcriptional level. MiR-107 is downregulated while FASN, a putative target of miR-107, was increased in diet-induced obese mice. These findings provide the evidence of the correlation of miRNAs and their targets in diet-induced obese mice.

Abstract: Arabidopsis WRKY proteins are plant-specific transcription factors, encoded by a large gene family, which contain the highly conserved amino acid sequence WRKYGQK and the zinc-finger-like motifs, Cys2His2 or Cys2HisCys. They can recognize and bind the TTGAC(C/T) W-box ciselements found in the promoters of target genes, and are involved in the regulation of gene expression during pathogen defense, wounding, trichome development, and senescence. Here we investigated the physiological function of the Arabidopsis WRKY22 transcription factor during dark-induced senescence. WRKY22 transcription was suppressed by light and promoted by darkness. In addition, AtWRKY22 expression was markedly induced by H2O2. These results indicated that AtWRKY22 was involved in signal pathways in response to abiotic stress. Dark-treated AtWRKY22 over-expression and knockout lines showed accelerated and delayed senescence phenotypes, respectively, and senescence-associated genes exhibited increased and decreased expression levels. Mutual regulation existed between AtWRKY22 and AtWRKY6, AtWRKY53, and AtWRKY70, respectively. Moreover, AtWRKY22 could influence their relative expression levels by feedback regulation or by other, as yet unknown mechanisms in response to dark. These results prove that AtWRKY22 participates in the dark-induced senescence signal transduction pathway.

Abstract: Disruptions of mitochondrial dynamics have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The regulation mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics have not been fully elucidated; however, calcium has been suggested to play a role. In the present study, we examined the role of intracellular calcium in regulating mitochondrial morphology and motility in cortical astrocytes employing different concentrations of a calcium ionophore. High levels of calcium caused a dramatic reduction in mitochondrial length, the result of two distinct phenomena: mitochondrial remodelling (or “rounding”) and fission. Quantitative analysis revealed that mitochondrial remodelling/rounding was the predominant process. In addition, mitochondrial motility was reduced, as reported previously in neurons. By contrast, prolonged, more modest levels of intracellular calcium resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial length without significant effects upon mitochondrial motility. This calcium-induced reduction in mitochondrial length was not affected by the presence of calcineurin inhibitors; however, when mitochondrial fission events were specifically examined, calcineurin inhibitors had a significant inhibitory effect. This suggests that changes in mitochondrial length were primarily due to mitochondrial remodelling as opposed to fission. In the present study, we have therefore dissected the effects of calcium on mitochondrial motility, remodelling and fission. Our results suggest independent mechanisms for regulating these processes.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by Dpp signaling and the Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) translational repressors. Upon division, Dpp signaling is extinguished, and Nos is downregulated in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a differentiating cystoblast (CB). However, downstream effectors of Pum-Nos remain unknown, and how CBs lose their responsiveness to Dpp is unclear. Here, we identify Brain Tumor (Brat) as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation. Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs. Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal. Mathematical modeling elucidates bistability of cell fate in the Brat-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number can arise from Brat coupling extracellular Dpp regulation to intracellular interpretation.

Abstract: We carried out activation tagging screen to isolate genes regulating abscisic acid (ABA) response. From the screen of approximately 10,000 plants, we isolated ca 100 ABA response mutants. We characterized one of the mutants, designated ahsl, in this study. The mutant is ABA-hypersensitive, and AtMYB52 was found to be activated in the mutant. Overexpression analysis to recapitulate the mutant phenotypes demonstrated that ATMYB confers ABA-hypersensitivity during postgermination growth. Additionally, AtMYB52 overexpression lines were drought-tolerant and their seedlings were salt-sensitive. Changes in the expression levels of a few genes involved in ABA response or cell wall biosynthesis were also observed. Together, our data suggest that AtMYB52 is involved in ABA response. Others previously demonstrated that AtMYB52 regulates cell wall biosynthesis; thus, our results imply a possible connec-tion between ABA response and cell wall biosynthesis.

Abstract: Intracellular Ca2+ control and the electrophysiological properties of guinea-pig urothelium were measured during interventions encountered during bladder filling, including cell stretch and exposure to exogenous transmitters such as ATP and muscarinic agonists. Stretch, achieved by exposure to solutions of altered osmolality, generated intracellular Ca2+-transients that were attenuated by Gd3+ in isolated cells. However ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+-transients were unaffected by Gd3+ but blocked by thapsigargin. ATP-dependent Ca2+-transients were followed by a large inward current at a holding potential of −60mV. Carbachol was without significant effect, except for a small slowing of the rate of spontaneous intracellular Ca2+-transients that were recorded in about one-third of cells. With urothelial sheets the transepithelial potential (TEP) was increased by ATP applied to the baso-lateral (serosal) face, a similar change was achieved by reduction of the basolateral [Na]; carbachol was without significant effect. We propose that a rise of intracellular Ca2+ may control ATP release as both mechanical stretch and exogenous ATP have been shown previously to release further ATP from isolated urothelium as part of a postulated signalling pathway for bladder filling. The similar increase of TEP by ATP and a raised transepithelial Na gradient is also consistent with a role for transepithelial ion transport as a regulator of ATP release. The lack of large effects with carbachol implies muscarinic agonists must exert any effects on the urothelium through other pathways.

Abstract: Both BRCA1 and CaSR have been shown to suppress the expression of survivin and promote sensitivity to paclitaxel in human breast cancer cells. In this study we determined the functional linkage, if any, between BRCA1 and CaSR. We found that mutant cells (harboring mutant BRCA1 with loss of BRCA1 expression) had a significant reduction in the expression of CaSR with a concurrent up-regulated expression of survivin and were resistant to paclitaxel by comparison to wild type cells (harboring wild type BRCA1 and expressing BRCA1). Knocking down the expression of BRCA1 in wild type cells resulted in a reduction in CaSR expression with a concurrent up-regulated expression of survivin and reduction in sensitivity to paclitaxel. Re-expression of BRCA1 in BRCA1 knocked-down wild type cells restored CaSR expression with a concurrent down-regulated expression of survivin and restoration of sensitivity to paclitaxel. Corollary, ectopic expression of BRCA1 in mutant cells induced CaSR expression, suppressed the expression of survivin and restored sensitivity to paclitaxel. These results suggest that BRCA1 action is linked to that of CaSR. In a final series of experiments, we show that ectopic expression of CaSR in either the BRCA1 knocked-down wild type or mutant cells suppressed the expression of survivin and promoted sensitivity to paclitaxel. Thus, CaSR can rescue BRCA1 defective cells from the deleterious effects of loss of BRCA1 function. CaSR expression, however, had no effect on the expression of BRCA1. BRCA1 could stimulate the transcriptional activities of the CaSR gene and shRNA targeting CaSR circumvented the action of BRCA1. We conclude, and report for the first time, that BRCA1 regulates the expression of CaSR and that it functions through CaSR in suppressing the expression of survivin and promoting sensitivity to paclitaxel.

Abstract: Summary
Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose that serves as an energy store. Phosphate, a trace constituent of glycogen, has profound effects on glycogen structure, and phosphate hyperaccumulation is linked to Lafora disease, a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy that can be caused by mutations of laforin, a glycogen phosphatase. However, little is known about the metabolism of glycogen phosphate. We demonstrate here that the biosynthetic enzyme glycogen synthase, which normally adds glucose residues to glycogen, is capable of incorporating the β-phosphate of its substrate UDP-glucose at a rate of one phosphate per approximately 10,000 glucoses, in what may be considered a catalytic error. We show that the phosphate in glycogen is present as C2 and C3 phosphomonoesters. Since hyperphosphorylation of glycogen causes Lafora disease, phosphate removal by laforin may thus be considered a repair or damage control mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of skeletal muscle mass relies on the dynamic balance between anabolic and catabolic processes and is important for motility, systemic energy homeostasis, and viability. We identified direct target genes of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in skeletal muscle, i.e., REDD1 and KLF15. As well as REDD1, KLF15 inhibits mTOR activity, but via a distinct mechanism involving BCAT2 gene activation. Moreover, KLF15 upregulates the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1 genes and negatively modulates myofiber size. Thus, GR is a liaison involving a variety of downstream molecular cascades toward muscle atrophy. Notably, mTOR activation inhibits GR transcription function and efficiently counteracts the catabolic processes provoked by glucocorticoids. This mutually exclusive crosstalk between GR and mTOR, a highly coordinated interaction between the catabolic hormone signal and the anabolic machinery, may be a rational mechanism for fine-tuning of muscle volume and a potential therapeutic target for muscle wasting.

Abstract: Summary
TRIC channel subtypes, namely TRIC-A and TRIC-B, are intracellular monovalent cation channels postulated to mediate counter-ion movements facilitating physiological Ca2+ release from internal stores. Tric-a-knockout mice developed hypertension during the daytime due to enhanced myogenic tone in resistance arteries. There are two Ca2+ release mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); incidental opening of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) generates local Ca2+ sparks to induce hyperpolarization, while agonist-induced activation of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) evokes global Ca2+ transients causing contraction. Tric-a gene ablation inhibited RyR-mediated hyperpolarization signaling to stimulate voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, and adversely enhanced IP3R-mediated Ca2+ transients by overloading Ca2+ stores in VSMCs. Moreover, association analysis identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human TRIC-A gene that increase hypertension risk and restrict the efficiency of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, TRIC-A channels contribute to maintaining blood pressure, while TRIC-A SNPs could provide biomarkers for constitutional diagnosis and personalized medical treatment of essential hypertension.

Abstract: A fluorescence-immunohistochemical investigation was performed in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) neurons of the rat with regard to ERK1/2-, p38- and STAT3-phosphorylation in response to nociceptor activation in the rat. The stimuli applied were perineural capsaicin treatment of the sciatic nerve, mustard oil application to the hind paw and heat or cold stimulation of the hind paw. The time points of investigations were 15min/30min after perineural capsaicin, 30min/2h/4h for mustard oil, 10min/4h for cold and 30min/2h/8h for the heat stimulus. All four stimuli lead to a time-dependent, significant 2–3 fold increase in the number of small and medium size DRG cells displaying cytoplasmic staining for p-ERK1/2, but to no activation of satellite cells. Phosphorylated p38 immunoreactivity was increased in the cytoplasma of DRG cells at 2h after the mustard oil treatment of the hind paw and 30min after the perineural capsaicin application to the sciatic nerve axons, but not following heat or cold stimuli to the hind paws. Phospho-STAT3 staining was characteristically observed as nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. It was found increased after the perineural capsaicin application to the sciatic nerve axons, however, no marked increase was found with the other 3 noxious stimuli. The present results show that sensory neurons respond with a selective long-lasting increase in p-ERK1/2 in small and medium-size DRG cells, when their axons or axon terminals are stimulated by capsaicin, mustard oil, noxious heat or noxious cold.

Abstract: Neuromedin U (NMU) has recently been reported to play a role in nociception. However, to date, the relevant mechanisms still remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression profile of NMU receptors in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and identified a novel functional role of NMU in modulating T-type Ca2+ channel currents (T-currents) as well as membrane excitability in small DRG neurons. We found that NMU inhibited T-currents in a dose-dependent manner in mouse small DRG neurons that endogenously expressed NMU type 1 (NMUR1), but not NMUR2 receptors. NMU (1μM) reversibly inhibited T-currents by ∼27.4%. This inhibitory effect was blocked by GDP-β-S or pertussis toxin (PTX), indicating the involvement of a Gi/oα-protein. Using depolarizing prepulse or intracellular application of QEHA, a synthetic peptide which competitively blocks G-protein βγ subunit (Gβγ) mediated signaling, we found the absence of functional coupling between Gβγ and T-type Ca2+ channels. Pretreatment of the cells with H89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, or intracellular application of PKI 5-24, blocked NMU-induced T-current inhibition, whereas inhibition of phospholipase C or protein kinase C elicited no such effects. In addition, we observed a significant decreased firing frequency of action potentials of small DRG neurons induced by NMU, which could be abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with NiCl2 (100μM). Taken together, these results suggested that NMU inhibits T-currents via PTX-sensitive PKA pathway, which might contribute to its physiological functions including neuronal hypoexcitability in small DRG neurons in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Upon nutrient deprivation, cells are thought to suppress biosynthesis but activate catabolic pathways to provide alternative energy sources and nutrients. However, here we provide evidence that in adult male C. elegans, both biosynthesis and degradation activities, including ribosome biogenesis and turnover, are enhanced during early starvation and appear to depend on the availability of intestinal lipid stores. Upon depletion of the intestinal lipids, further food deprivation results in a significant reduction in metabolic activity in the starved male worms. Our data show that adult C. elegans exhibits a two-phase metabolic response to starvation stress: an initial phase with enhanced metabolic activity that rapidly exhausts the lipid stores, followed by a phase with low metabolic activity, which outlasts the life of fed control worms. DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling to the RAS pathway is required for the starvation-induced ribosome biogenesis and rapid lipid depletion in the initial phase of starvation.

Abstract: The interleukin 6 family of cytokines including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates the progression of several types of cancer. However, although LIF overexpression during breast cancer progression was observed in our previous report, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this deregulation remain largely unknown. Here we show that LIF expression is epigenetically up-regulated via DNA demethylation and changes in histone methylation status within its promoter region in the isogenic MCF10 model. Bisulfite sequencing revealed the CpG pairs within the promoter region are hypermethylated in normal breast epithelial cells, but extensively demethylated as breast cancer progresses. In agreement with the DNA methylation pattern, our chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that inactive epigenetic marks such as MeCP2 occupancy and histone H3-Lys9-dimethylation significantly decreased during the progression to breast cancer but an active histone mark was increased in an inverse manner. Also, the occupancy of the transcription factor Sp1, which has higher affinity for hypomethylated CpGs, increased. RNAimediated knockdown of LIF expression resulted in a significant reduction of cell growth and colony formation in breast cancer cells, suggesting the potential role of LIF-LIF receptor axis in autocrine stimulation of cancer cells. Collectively, our data suggest that the epigenetic up-regulation of the LIF gene likely play an important role in the development of breast cancer.

Abstract: On the mechanistic level, response of periodontal fibroblasts permanently exposed to mechanical strain forces in vivo still lacks in clarity. Therefore, we first investigated putative strain modulation of proteins by combined 1D gel electrophoresis-based protein profiling and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Thereafter, the exponential-modified protein abundance index (emPAI) identified strain modulation of cytoskeleton-associated molecules, including decrease in talin and microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), and significant increase in myosin IC (Myo IC), the latter ones regulated by Ca2+. These findings were corroborated by western blotting (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Regarding the dual function of Myo IC as actin-based cytoplasmic motor protein and nuclear transcription factor NM1, WB and IIF revealed inverse correlation for Myo IC and NM1. During strain application, cytoplasmic increase of Myo IC was counteracted by nuclear NM1 deprivation, the latter coinciding with a decline in RNA quantity. Independent on strain, cytoplasmic Myo IC and nuclear NM1 abundance could be abrogated by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, suggesting Ca2+ dependency of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear Myo IC/NM1 expression. Mechanistically, we conclude that, application of strain appears as causative for the decline in RNA by impacting NM1, thereby indicating the possible role of NM1 in RNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The proximodistal (PD) axis of the Drosophila leg is thought to be established by the combined gradients of two secreted morphogens, Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp). According to this model, high [Wg+Dpp] activates Distalless (Dll) and represses dachshund (dac) in the distal cells of the leg disc, while intermediate [Wg+Dpp] activates dac in medial tissue. To test this model we identified and characterized a dac cis-regulatory element (dac RE) that recapitulates dac's medial expression domain during leg development. Counter to the gradient model, we find that Wg and Dpp do not act in a graded manner to activate RE. Instead, dac RE is activated directly by Dll and repressed distally by a combination of factors, including the homeodomain protein Bar. Thus, medial leg fates are established via a regulatory cascade in which Wg+Dpp activate Dll and then Dll directly activates dac, with Wg+Dpp as less critical, permissive inputs.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare cancer-predisposing genetic disease mostly caused by improper regulation of the monoubiquitination of Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2). Genetic studies have indicated that ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2T and HHR6 could regulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination through distinct mechanisms. However, the exact regulation mechanisms of FANCD2 monoubiquitination in response to different DNA damages remain unclear. Here we report that UBE2W, a new ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, could regulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination by mechanisms different from UBE2T or HHR6. Indeed, UBE2W exhibits ubiquitin conjugating enzyme activity and catalyzes the monoubiquitination of PHD domain of Fanconi anemia complementation group L (FANCL) in vitro. UBE2W binds to FANCL, and the PHD domain is both necessary and sufficient for this interaction in mammalian cells. In addition, over-expression of UBE2W in cells promotes the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and down-regulated UBE2W markedly reduces the UV irradiation-induced but not MMC-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination. These results indicate that UBE2W regulates FANCD2 monoubiquitination by mechanisms different from UBE2T and HRR6. It may provide an additional regulatory step in the activation of the FA pathway.

Abstract: Cellular replacement therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effect of transplantation of induced mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into endoderm and early hepatocyte-like cells in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice. After embryoid body (EB) formation from mESC, the EBs were cultured in the presence of dexamethasone (DEX) and insulin for 4 days then was added acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and oncostatin M (OSM) for 10 days, respectively. Blood glucose levels, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance (IGT) test and islet histology were assessed. The result revealed that transplantation of induced mESCs into early hepatocyte-like cells could repair pancreatic islets of control group. Blood glucose levels and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test were significantly improved in test group compared to control group. Furthermore, there was significant increase in the number of islets in test group compared to control group. The findings declare that induced mESCs into endoderm and early hepatocyte-like cells, are appropriate candidate for regenerative therapy of pancreatic islets in type I diabetes.

Abstract: Electron microscopic images of mitochondrial nucleoids isolated from mung bean seedlings revealed a relatively homogeneous population of particles, each consisting of a chromatin-like structure associated with a membrane component. Association of F-actin with mitochondrial nucleoids was also observed. The mitochondrial nucleoid structure identified in situ showed heterogeneous genomic organization. After pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), a large proportion of the mitochondrial nucleoid DNA remained in the well, whereas the rest migrated as a 50-200 kb smear zone. This PFGE migration pattern was not affected by high salt, topoisomerase I or latrunculin B treatments; however, the mobility of a fraction of the fastmoving DNA decreased conspicuously following an in-gel ethidium-enhanced UV-irradiation treatment, suggesting that molecules with intricately compact structures were present in the 50-200 kb region. Approximately 70% of the mitochondrial nucleoid DNA molecules examined via electron microscopy were open circles, supercoils, complex forms, and linear molecules with interspersed sigmashaped structures and/or loops. Increased sensitivity of mtDNA to DNase I was found after mitochondrial nucleoids were pretreated with high salt. This result indicates that some loosely bound or peripheral DNA binding proteins protected the mtDNA from DNase I degradation.

Abstract: Summary
SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent enzyme that affects metabolism by deacetylating key transcriptional regulators of energy expenditure. Here, we tested whether deletion of PARP-2, an alternative NAD+-consuming enzyme, impacts on NAD+ bioavailability and SIRT1 activity. Our results indicate that PARP-2 deficiency increases SIRT1 activity in cultured myotubes. However, this increase was not due to changes in NAD+ levels, but to an increase in SIRT1 expression, as PARP-2 acts as a direct negative regulator of the SIRT1 promoter. PARP-2 deletion in mice increases SIRT1 levels, promotes energy expenditure, and increases mitochondrial content. Furthermore, PARP-2−/− mice were protected against diet-induced obesity. Despite being insulin sensitized, PARP-2−/− mice were glucose intolerant due to a defective pancreatic function. Hence, while inhibition of PARP activity promotes oxidative metabolism through SIRT1 activation, the use of PARP inhibitors for metabolic purposes will require further understanding of the specific functions of different PARP family members.

Adiponectin Enhances Insulin Sensitivity by Increasing Hepatic IRS-2 Expression via a Macrophage-Derived IL-6-Dependent Pathway,

Abstract: Summary
Insulin resistance is often associated with impeded insulin signaling due either to decreased concentrations or functional modifications of crucial signaling molecules including insulin receptor substrates (IRS) in the liver. Many actions of adiponectin, a well-recognized antidiabetic adipokine, are currently attributed to the activation of two critical molecules downstream of AdipoR1 and R2: AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). However, the direct effects of adiponectin on insulin signaling molecules remain poorly understood. We show here that adiponectin upregulates IRS-2 through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). Surprisingly, this activation is associated with IL-6 production from macrophages induced by adiponectin through NFκB activation independent of its authentic receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. These data have unraveled an insulin-sensitizing action initiated by adiponectin leading to upregulation of hepatic IRS-2 via an IL-6 dependent pathway through a still unidentified adiponectin receptor.
