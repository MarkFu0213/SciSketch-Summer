Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown remarkable response rates in hematological malignancies. In contrast, CAR T cell treatment of solid tumors is associated with several challenges, in particular the expression of most tumor-associated antigens at lower levels in vital organs, resulting in on-target/off-tumor toxicities. Thus, innovative approaches to improve the tumor specificity of CAR T cells are urgently needed. Based on the observation that many human solid tumors activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on their surface through secretion of EGFR ligands, we developed an engineering strategy for CAR-binding domains specifically directed against the ligand-activated conformation of EGFR. We show, in several experimental systems, that the generated binding domains indeed enable CAR T cells to distinguish between active and inactive EGFR. We anticipate that this engineering concept will be an important step forward to improve the tumor specificity of CAR T cells directed against EGFR-positive solid cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells are tissue stem cells capable of differentiating into alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells for injury repair and maintenance of lung homeostasis. However, the factors involved in human AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation are not fully understood. Here, we established SFTPCGFP and AGERmCherry-HiBiT dual-reporter induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which detected AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation with high sensitivity and identified factors inducing AT1 cell differentiation from AT2 and their progenitor cells. We also established an “on-gel” alveolar epithelial spheroid culture suitable for medium-throughput screening. Among the 274 chemical compounds, several single compounds, including LATS-IN-1, converted AT1 cells from AT2 and their progenitor cells. Moreover, YAP/TAZ signaling activation and AKT signaling suppression synergistically recapitulated the induction of transcriptomic, morphological, and functionally mature AT1 cells. Our findings provide novel insights into human lung development and lung regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating wheat disease. Fhb1, the most widely applied genetic locus for FHB resistance, is conferred by TaHRC of an unknown mode of action. Here, we show that TaHRC alleles distinctly drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within a proteinaceous complex, determining FHB susceptibility or resistance. TaHRC-S (susceptible) exhibits stronger LLPS ability than TaHRC-R (resistant), and this distinction is further intensified by fungal mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, leading to opposing FHB symptoms. TaHRC recruits a protein class with intrinsic LLPS potentials, referred to as an “HRC-containing hub.” TaHRC-S drives condensation of hub components, while TaHRC-R comparatively suppresses hub condensate formation. The function of TaSR45a splicing factor, a hub member, depends on TaHRC-driven condensate state, which in turn differentially directs alternative splicing, switching between susceptibility and resistance to wheat FHB. These findings reveal a mechanism for FHB spread within a spike and shed light on the roles of complex condensates in controlling plant disease.

Abstract: m6A modification has been studied in tumors, but its role in host anti-tumor immune response and TAMs polarization remains unclear. The fatty acid oxidation (FAO) process of TAMs is also attracting attention. A co-culture model of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and macrophages was used to simulate the tumor microenvironment. Expression changes of m6A demethylase genes FTO and ALKBH5 were screened. ALKBH5 was further investigated. Gain-of-function experiments were conducted to study ALKBH5's effects on macrophage M2 polarization, CRC cell viability, proliferation, migration, and more. Me-RIP and Actinomycin D assays were performed to study ALKBH5's influence on CPT1A, the FAO rate-limiting enzyme. AMP, ADP, and ATP content detection, OCR measurement, and ECAR measurement were used to explore ALKBH5's impact on macrophage FAO level. Rescue experiments validated ALKBH5's mechanistic role in macrophage M2 polarization and CRC malignant development. In co-culture, CRC cells enhance macrophage FAO and suppress m6A modification in M2 macrophages. ALKBH5 was selected as the gene for further investigation. ALKBH5 mediates CPT1A upregulation by removing m6A modification, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and facilitating CRC development. These findings indicate that ALKBH5 enhances fatty acid metabolism and M2 polarization of macrophages by upregulating CPT1A, thereby promoting CRC development.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants necessitated a rapid evaluation system for their pathogenesis. Lung epithelial cells are their entry points; however, in addition to their limited source, the culture of human alveolar epithelial cells is especially complicated. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an alternative source of human primary stem cells. Here, we report a model for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 variants at high resolution, using separately induced iPSC-derived alveolar and airway cells in micro-patterned culture plates. The position-specific signals induced the apical-out alveolar type 2 and multiciliated airway cells at the periphery and center of the colonies, respectively. The infection studies in each lineage enabled profiling of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants: infection efficiency, tropism to alveolar and airway lineages, and their responses. These results indicate that this culture system is suitable for predicting the pathogenesis of emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive, CD30+ T cell lymphoma of children and adults. ALK fusion transcripts or mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway are observed in most ALCL tumors, but the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis are not fully understood. Here, we show that dysregulated STAT3 in ALCL cooccupies enhancers with master transcription factors BATF3, IRF4, and IKZF1 to form a core regulatory circuit that establishes and maintains the malignant cell state in ALCL. Critical downstream targets of this network in ALCL cells include the protooncogene MYC, which requires active STAT3 to facilitate high levels of MYC transcription. The core autoregulatory transcriptional circuitry activity is reinforced by MYC binding to the enhancer regions associated with STAT3 and each of the core regulatory transcription factors. Thus, activation of STAT3 provides the crucial link between aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling and the core transcriptional machinery that drives tumorigenesis and creates therapeutic vulnerabilities in ALCL.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme that regulates physiological processes via lipid and calcium signaling. Despite advances in protein engineering, no tools are available for direct PLC control. Here, we developed a novel optogenetic tool, light-controlled PLCβ (opto-PLCβ). Opto-PLCβ uses a light-induced dimer module, which directs an engineered PLC to the plasma membrane in a light-dependent manner. Our design includes an autoinhibitory capacity, ensuring stringent control over PLC activity. Opto-PLCβ triggers reversible calcium responses and lipid dynamics in a restricted region, allowing precise spatiotemporal control of PLC signaling. Using our system, we discovered that phospholipase D-mediated phosphatidic acid contributes to diacylglycerol clearance on the plasma membrane. Moreover, we extended its applicability in vivo, demonstrating that opto-PLCβ can enhance amygdala synaptic plasticity and associative fear learning in mice. Thus, opto-PLCβ offers precise spatiotemporal control, enabling comprehensive investigation of PLC-mediated signaling pathways, lipid dynamics, and their physiological consequences in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Most recurrences of lung cancer (LC) occur within 3 years after surgery, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we collect LC tissues with shorter (<3 years, recurrence group) and longer (>3 years, non-recurrence group) recurrence-free survival. By using 16S sequencing, we find that intratumor microbiome diversity is lower in the recurrence group and butyrate-producing bacteria are enriched in the recurrence group. The intratumor microbiome signature and circulating microbiome DNA can accurately predict LC recurrence. We prove that intratumor injection of butyrate-producing bacteria Roseburia can promote subcutaneous tumor growth. Mechanistically, bacteria-derived butyrate promotes LC metastasis by increasing expression of H19 in tumor cells through inhibiting HDAC2 and increasing H3K27 acetylation at the H19 promoter and inducing M2 macrophage polarization. Depletion of macrophages partially abolishes the metastasis-promoting effect of butyrate. Our results provide evidence for the cross-talk between the intratumor microbiome and LC metastasis and suggest the potential prognostic and therapeutic value of the intratumor microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
Of the targets for HIV-1 therapeutics, the capsid core is a relatively unexploited but alluring drug target due to its indispensable roles throughout virus replication. Because of this, we aimed to identify “clickable” covalent modifiers of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) for future functionalization. We screened a library of fluorosulfate compounds that can undergo sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reactions, and five compounds were identified as hits. These molecules were further characterized for antiviral effects. Several compounds impacted in vitro capsid assembly. One compound, BBS-103, covalently bound CA via a SuFEx reaction to Tyr145 and had antiviral activity in cell-based assays by perturbing virus production, but not uncoating. The covalent binding of compounds that target the HIV-1 capsid could aid in the future design of antiretroviral drugs or chemical probes that will help study aspects of HIV-1 replication.

Abstract: Summary
Defective skeletal muscle regeneration is often accompanied by fibrosis. Fibroblast/adipose progenitors (FAPs) are important in these processes, however, the regulation of FAP fate decisions is unclear. Here, using inducible conditional knockout mice, we show that blocking mammalian Ste20-like kinases 1/2 (MST1/2) of FAPs prevented apoptosis and reduced interleukin-6 secretion in vivo and in vitro, which impaired myoblast proliferation and differentiation, as well as impaired muscle regeneration. Deletion of Mst1/2 increased co-localization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) with Smad2/3 in nuclei and promoted differentiation of FAPs toward myofibroblasts, resulting in excessive collagen deposition and skeletal muscle fibrosis. Meanwhile, inhibition of MST1/2 increased YAP/Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif activation, which promoted activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and impaired the differentiation of FAPs toward adipocytes. These results reveal a new mechanism for MST1/2 action in disrupted skeletal muscle regeneration and fibrosis via regulation of FAP apoptosis and differentiation. MST1/2 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of some myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advancements in image-based pooled CRISPR screening have facilitated the mapping of diverse genotype-phenotype associations within mammalian cells. However, the rapid enrichment of cells based on morphological information continues to pose a challenge, constraining the capacity for large-scale gene perturbation screening across diverse high-content cellular phenotypes. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of multimodal ghost cytometry-based cell sorting, including both fluorescent and label-free high-content phenotypes, for rapid pooled CRISPR screening within vast cell populations. Using the high-content cell sorter operating in fluorescence mode, we successfully executed kinase-specific CRISPR screening targeting genes influencing the nuclear translocation of RelA. Furthermore, using the multiparametric, label-free mode, we performed large-scale screening to identify genes involved in macrophage polarization. Notably, the label-free platform can enrich target phenotypes without requiring invasive staining, preserving untouched cells for downstream assays and expanding the potential for screening cellular phenotypes even when suitable markers are absent.

Abstract: Summary
Endometriosis, affecting 6%–10% of women, often leads to pain and infertility and its underlying inflammatory mechanisms are poorly understood. We established endometriosis models in wild-type and IL16KO mice, revealing the driver function of IL-16 in initiating endometriosis-related inflammation. Using an in vitro system, we confirmed iron overload-induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a key trigger for IL-16 activation and release. In addition, our research led to the development of Z30702029, a compound inhibiting GSDME-NTD-mediated pyroptosis, which shows promise as a therapeutic intervention for endometriosis. Importantly, our findings extend beyond endometriosis, highlighting GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a broader pathway for IL-16 release and offering insights into potential treatments for various inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is known for high relapse rates despite resection in early stages. Here, we present the results of a phase I clinical trial in which a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine targeting patient-individual neoantigens is evaluated in patients with resected NSCLC. Vaccine manufacturing is feasible in six of 10 enrolled patients. Toxicity is limited to grade 1–2 adverse events. Systemic T cell responses are observed in five out of six vaccinated patients, with T cell responses remaining detectable up to 19 months post vaccination. Single-cell analysis indicates that the responsive T cell population is polyclonal and exhibits the near-entire spectrum of T cell differentiation states, including a naive-like state, but excluding exhausted cell states. Three of six vaccinated patients experience disease recurrence during the follow-up period of 2 years. Collectively, these data support the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of this treatment in resected NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the dynamic expression of proteins and other key molecules driving phenotypic remodeling in development and pathobiology has garnered widespread interest, yet the exploration of these systems at the foundational resolution of the underlying cell states has been significantly limited by technical constraints. Here, we present DESP, an algorithm designed to leverage independent estimates of cell-state proportions, such as from single-cell RNA sequencing, to resolve the relative contributions of cell states to bulk molecular measurements, most notably quantitative proteomics, recorded in parallel. We applied DESP to an in vitro model of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and demonstrated its ability to accurately reconstruct cell-state signatures from bulk-level measurements of both the proteome and transcriptome, providing insights into transient regulatory mechanisms. DESP provides a generalizable computational framework for modeling the relationship between bulk and single-cell molecular measurements, enabling the study of proteomes and other molecular profiles at the cell-state level using established bulk-level workflows.

Abstract: This article demonstrates that label-free single-cell video tracking is a useful approach for in vitro studies of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). EMT is a highly heterogeneous process, involved in wound healing, embryogenesis and cancer. The process promotes metastasis, and increased understanding can aid development of novel therapeutic strategies. The role of EMT-associated biomarkers depends on biological context, making it challenging to compare and interpret data from different studies. We demonstrate single-cell video tracking for comprehensive phenotype analysis. In this study we performed single-cell video tracking on 72-h long recordings. We quantified several behaviours at a single-cell level during induced EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells. This revealed notable variations in migration speed, with different dose-response patterns and varying distributions of speed. By registering cell morphologies during the recording, we determined preferred paths of morphological transitions. We also found a clear association between migration speed and cell morphology. We found elevated rates of cell death, diminished proliferation, and an increase in mitotic failures followed by re-fusion of sister-cells. The method allows tracking of phenotypes in cell lineages, which can be particularly useful in epigenetic studies. Sister-cells were found to have significant similarities in their speeds and morphologies, illustrating the heritability of these traits.

Abstract: Summary
The risk of iatrogenic disease is often underestimated as a concern in contemporary medical procedures, encompassing tissue and organ transplantation, stem cell therapies, blood transfusions, and the administration of blood-derived products. In this context, despite the prevailing belief that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests primarily in familial and sporadic forms, our investigation reveals an unexpected transplantable variant of AD in a preclinical context, potentially indicating iatrogenic transmission in AD patients. Through adoptive transplantation of donor bone marrow stem cells carrying a mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene into either APP-deficient knockout or normal recipient animals, we observed rapid development of AD pathological hallmarks. These pathological features were significantly accelerated and emerged within 6–9 months post transplantation and included compromised blood-brain barrier integrity, heightened cerebral vascular neoangiogenesis, elevated brain-associated β-amyloid levels, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, our findings underscore the contribution of β-amyloid burden originating outside of the central nervous system to AD pathogenesis within the brain. We conclude that stem cell transplantation from donors harboring a pathogenic mutant allele can effectively transfer central nervous system diseases to healthy recipients, mirroring the pathogenesis observed in the donor. Consequently, our observations advocate for genomic sequencing of donor specimens prior to tissue, organ, or stem cell transplantation therapies, as well as blood transfusions and blood-derived product administration, to mitigate the risk of iatrogenic diseases.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the changes in oxidative stress, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), connexin43 (Cx43), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) expression, and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the gastric smooth muscle tissues of rats with diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) and high glucose-cultured gastric smooth muscle cells, determine the existence of oxidative stress-AMPK-Cx43-NLRP3 pathway under high glucose condition, and the involvement of this pathway in ECM remodeling in DGP rats. The results showed that with increasing duration of diabetes, oxidation stress levels gradually increased, the AMPK activity decreased first and then increased, NLRP3, CX43 expression, and membrane/cytoplasm ratio of Cx43 expression were increased in the gastric smooth muscle tissues of diabetic rats. Changes in ECM of gastric smooth muscle cells were observed in DGP rats. The DGP group showed higher collagen type I content, increased expression of Caspase-1, transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression, and higher interleukin-1 beta content when compared with the control group. For gastric smooth muscle cells cultured under higher glucose, the MMP-2 and TGF-β3 expression was decreased, TGF-β1 and TIMP-1 expression was increased, the interleukin-1 beta content was decreased in cells after inhibition of NLRP3 expression; the NLRP3 and Caspase-1 expression was decreased, and adenosine triphosphate content was lower after inhibition of Cx43; the expression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, P2X7, and the membrane/cytoplasm ratio of CX43 expression was decreased in cells after inhibition of AMPK and oxidative stress, the phospho-AMPK expression was also decreased after suppressing oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that high glucose induced the activation of the AMPK-Cx43-NLRP3 pathway through oxidative stress, and this pathway was involved in the ECM remodeling of gastric smooth muscles in DGP rats by regulating the biological functions of TGF-β3, TGF-β1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cell phenotyping frequently detects lineage-unrelated receptors. Here, we report that surface receptors can be transferred from primary macrophages to CD4 T cells and identify the Fcγ receptor CD32 as driver and cargo of this trogocytotic transfer. Filamentous CD32+ nanoprotrusions deposit distinct plasma membrane patches onto target T cells. Transferred receptors confer cell migration and adhesion properties, and macrophage-derived membrane patches render resting CD4 T cells susceptible to infection by serving as hotspots for HIV-1 binding. Antibodies that recognize T cell epitopes enhance CD32-mediated trogocytosis. Such autoreactive anti-HIV-1 envelope antibodies can be found in the blood of HIV-1 patients and, consistently, the percentage of CD32+ CD4 T cells is increased in their blood. This CD32-mediated, antigen-independent cell communication mode transiently expands the receptor repertoire and functionality of immune cells. HIV-1 hijacks this mechanism by triggering the generation of trogocytosis-promoting autoantibodies to gain access to immune cells critical to its persistence.

Abstract: Long-term hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a main lethal complication of diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying DCM development have not been fully elucidated. Heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) is the atypic member of the Heat shock 70kDa protein family. In the present study, we found that the expression of HSPA12A was upregulated in the hearts of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, while ablation of HSPA12A improved cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction and increased cumulative survival of diabetic mice. An increased expression of HSPA12A was also found in H9c2 cardiac cells following treatment with high glucose (HG), while overexpression of HSPA12A-enhanced the HG-induced cardiac cell death, as reflected by higher levels of propidium iodide cells, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, and caspase 3 cleavage. Moreover, the HG-induced increase of oxidative stress, as indicated by dihydroethidium staining, was exaggerated by HSPA12A overexpression. Further studies demonstrated that the HG-induced increases of protein kinase B and forkhead box transcription factors 1 phosphorylation were diminished by HSPA12A overexpression, while pharmacologically inhibition of protein kinase B further enhanced the HG-induced lactate dehydrogenase leakage in HSPA12A overexpressed cardiac cells. Together, the results suggest that hyperglycemia upregulated HSPA12A expression in cardiac cells, by which induced cell death to promote DCM development. Targeting HSPA12A may serve as a potential approach for DCM management.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) are a rare subpopulation of cells within a tumor that can survive therapy through nongenetic adaptive mechanisms to develop relapse and repopulate the tumor following drug withdrawal. Using a cancer cell line with an engineered suicide switch to kill proliferating cells, we perform both genetic screens and compound screens to identify the inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins as a selective vulnerability of DTPs. BET inhibitors are especially detrimental to DTPs that have reentered the cell cycle (DTEPs) in a broad spectrum of cancer types. Mechanistically, BET inhibition induces lethal levels of ROS through the suppression of redox-regulating genes highly expressed in DTPs, including GPX2, ALDH3A1, and MGST1. In vivo BET inhibitor treatment delays tumor relapse in both melanoma and lung cancer. Our study suggests that combining standard of care therapy with BET inhibitors to eliminate residual persister cells is a promising therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Precise insertion of fluorescent proteins into lineage-specific genes in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) presents challenges due to low knockin efficiency and difficulties in isolating targeted cells. To overcome these hurdles, we present the modified mRNA (ModRNA)-based Activation for Gene Insertion and Knockin (MAGIK) method. MAGIK operates in two steps: first, it uses a Cas9-2A-p53DD modRNA with a mini-donor plasmid (without a drug selection cassette) to significantly enhance efficiency. Second, a deactivated Cas9 activator modRNA and a 'dead' guide RNA are used to temporarily activate the targeted gene, allowing for live cell sorting of targeted cells. Consequently, MAGIK eliminates the need for drug selection cassettes or labor-intensive single-cell colony screening, expediting precise gene editing. We showed MAGIK can be utilized to insert fluorescent proteins into various genes, including SOX17, NKX6.1, NKX2.5, and PDX1, across multiple hPSC lines. This underscores its robust performance and offers a promising solution for achieving knockin in hPSCs within a significantly shortened time frame.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted therapies have improved outcomes for certain cancer subtypes, but cytotoxic chemotherapy remains a mainstay for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program co-opted by cancer cells that promotes metastasis and chemoresistance. There are no therapeutic strategies specifically targeting mesenchymal-like cancer cells. We report that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapeutic eribulin induces ZEB1-SWI/SNF-directed chromatin remodeling to reverse EMT that curtails the metastatic propensity of TNBC preclinical models. Eribulin induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in primary TNBC in patients, but conventional chemotherapy does not. In the treatment-naive setting, but not after acquired resistance to other agents, eribulin sensitizes TNBC cells to subsequent treatment with other chemotherapeutics. These findings provide an epigenetic mechanism of action of eribulin, supporting its use early in the disease process for MET induction to prevent metastatic progression and chemoresistance. These findings warrant prospective clinical evaluation of the chemosensitizing effects of eribulin in the treatment-naive setting.

Abstract: Summary
Spatially resolved epigenomic profiling is critical for understanding biology in the mammalian brain. Single-cell spatial epigenomic assays were developed recently for this purpose, but they remain costly and labor intensive for examining brain tissues across substantial dimensions and surveying a collection of brain samples. Here, we demonstrate an approach, epigenomic tomography, that maps spatial epigenomes of mouse brain at the scale of centimeters. We individually profiled neuronal and glial fractions of mouse neocortex slices with 0.5 mm thickness. Tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) or acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) features across these slices were grouped into clusters based on their spatial variation patterns to form epigenomic brain maps. As a proof of principle, our approach reveals striking dynamics in the frontal cortex due to kainic-acid-induced seizure, linked with transmembrane ion transporters, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and secretion of neurotransmitters. Epigenomic tomography provides a powerful and cost-effective tool for characterizing brain disorders based on the spatial epigenome.

Abstract: Summary
A comprehensive analysis of site-specific protein O-glycosylation is hindered by the absence of a consensus O-glycosylation motif, the diversity of O-glycan structures, and the lack of a universal enzyme that cleaves attached O-glycans. Here, we report the development of a robust O-glycoproteomic workflow for analyzing complex biological samples by combining four different strategies: removal of N-glycans, complementary digestion using O-glycoprotease (IMPa) with/without another protease, glycopeptide enrichment, and mass spectrometry with fragmentation of glycopeptides using stepped collision energy. Using this workflow, we cataloged 474 O-glycopeptides on 189 O-glycosites derived from 79 O-glycoproteins from human plasma. These data revealed O-glycosylation of several abundant proteins that have not been previously reported. Because many of the proteins that contained unannotated O-glycosylation sites have been extensively studied, we wished to confirm glycosylation at these sites in a targeted fashion. Thus, we analyzed selected purified proteins (kininogen-1, fetuin-A, fibrinogen, apolipoprotein E, and plasminogen) in independent experiments and validated the previously unknown O-glycosites.

Abstract: Summary
With the increasing electrification of road transport in China, there is a need to put eyes on the disposal of retired batteries. Reusing the retired batteries for rural electrification presents great promise, but this possibility has not been comprehensively investigated. We study how to contribute to sustainable development goals and carbon neutrality in China by establishing a battery-reusing system in rural residential sector from 2021 to 2060. Our results show that, before 2060, the accumulated rural residential installations of distributed solar photovoltaics with reused batteries can reach 364.2∼403.0 GW. The avoided annual CO2 emissions range from 505.9 to 536.4 million tons, and the total recovered lithium and cobalt from retired batteries will be no less than 88.8% and 60.0% of their respective 2021 global mining volumes. The system is believed to introduce changes to subsidy-driven policy to promote sustainable development by transitioning to one that is market based.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid cells, which originate from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), play a crucial role in mitigating infections. This study aimed to explore the impact of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) on the differentiation of HSPCs and progenitors through the C-C motif chemokine CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway. Murine MSCs, identified as PDGFRα+Sca-1+ cells (PαS cells), were found to secrete CCL2, particularly in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. MSC-secreted CCL2 promoted the differentiation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors into the myeloid lineage. MSC-derived CCL2 plays an important role in the early phase of myeloid cell differentiation in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that CCL2-mediated cell fate determination was also observed in human bone marrow cells. These findings provide valuable insights for investigating the in vivo effects of MSC transplantation.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a kind of highly malignant tumor. Studies have shown that Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) may be responsible for dismal prognosis in NSCLC. Immunotherapy with programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has significantly altered the treatment of assorted cancers, including NSCLC, but its role and mechanism in the formation of Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in NSCLC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of the anti-PD-L1 antibody in the formation of VM in NSCLC and its possible mechanisms. The results showed that anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy could inhibit the growth of NSCLC-transplanted tumors and reduce the formation of VMs. In addition, this study found that anti-PD-L1 antibodies could increase the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related factor E-cadherin. zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is an important transcription factor regulating EMT. Knocking down ZEB1 could significantly inhibit tumor growth, as well as the expression of VE-cadherin and mmp2, while remarkably increase the expression of E-cadherin. During this process, the formation of VM was inhibited by knowing down ZEB1 in both in vitro and in vivo experiments of the constructed ZEB1 knockdown stable transfected cell strains. Therefore, in this study, we found that anti-PD-L1 antibodies may reduce the formation of VMs by inhibiting the EMT process.

Abstract: Hepatocytes are responsible for maintaining a stable blood glucose concentration during periods of nutrient scarcity. The breakdown of glycogen and de novo synthesis of glucose are crucial metabolic pathways deeply interlinked with lipid metabolism. Alterations in these pathways are often associated with metabolic diseases with serious clinical implications. Studying energy metabolism in human cells is challenging. Primary hepatocytes are still considered the golden standard for in vitro studies and have been instrumental in elucidating key aspects of energy metabolism found in vivo. As a result of several limitations posed by using primary cells, a multitude of alternative hepatocyte cellular models emerged as potential substitutes. Yet, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the precise applications for which these models accurately reflect the metabolic competence of primary hepatocytes. In this study, we compared primary hepatocytes, stem cell-derived hepatocytes, adult donor-derived liver organoids, immortalized Upcyte-hepatocytes and the hepatoma cell line HepG2s in their response to a glucose production challenge. We observed the highest net glucose production in primary hepatocytes, followed by organoids, stem-cell derived hepatocytes, Upcyte-hepatocytes and HepG2s. Glucogenic gene induction was observed in all tested models, as indicated by an increase in G6PC and PCK1 expression. Lipidomic analysis revealed considerable differences across the models, with organoids showing the closest similarity to primary hepatocytes in the common lipidome, comprising 347 lipid species across 19 classes. Changes in lipid profiles as a result of the glucose production challenge showed a variety of, and in some cases opposite, trends when compared to primary hepatocytes.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is a common tumor that impacts the urinary system and marked by a significant fatality rate and an unfavorable prognosis. Promising antineoplastic properties are exhibited by brusatol, which is obtained from the dried ripe fruit of Brucea javanica. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of brusatol on the progression of bladder cancer and uncover the molecular mechanism involved. We used Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation and EdU assays to detect cell numbers, viability and proliferation. We used transwell migration assay to detect cell migration ability. The mechanism of brusatol inhibition of bladder cancer proliferation was studied by flow cytometry and western blotting. It was revealed that brusatol could reduce the viability and proliferation of T24 and 5637 cells. The transwell migration assay revealed that brusatol was able to attenuate the migration of T24 and 5637 cells. We found that treatment with brusatol increased the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and Fe2+, thereby further promoting ferroptosis in T24 and 5637 cells. In addition, treatment with RSL3 (an agonistor of ferroptosis) ferrostatin-1 (a selective inhibitor of ferroptosis) enhanced or reversed the brusatol-induced inhibition. In vivo, treatment with brusatol significantly suppressed the tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistically, brusatol induced ferroptosis by upregulating the expression of ChaC glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (Chac1) and decreasing the expression of SLC7A11 and Nrf2 in T24 and 5637 cells. To summarize, the findings of this research demonstrated that brusatol hindered the growth of bladder cancer and triggered ferroptosis via the Chac1/Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway.

Abstract: The pro-angiogenic abilities of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) make them attractive candidates for cellular therapy, especially for ischemic disease indications. However, details regarding the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate paracrine and juxtacrine abilities of ASCs in angiogenesis triple cell co-cultures by detailed image analysis of the vascular-like structures. Fibroblast-endothelial cell co-cultures were established, and ASCs were added directly or indirectly through inserts. The cultures were treated with antibodies or subjected to analyses using ELISA and RT2 PCR Arrays. The model consistently generated vascular-like structures. ASCs increased the total branch lengths equally well in paracrine and juxtacrine conditions, by increasing the number of branches and average branch lengths (ABL). In contrast, addition of VEGF to the model increased the number of branches, but not the ABL. Still, ASCs increased the VEGF levels in supernatants of paracrine and juxtacrine co-cultures, and anti-VEGF treatment decreased the sprouting. ASCs themselves up-regulated collagen type V in response to paracrine signals from the co-cultures. The results suggest that ASCs initiate sprouting through secretion of several paracrine factors, among which VEGF is identified, but VEGF alone does not recapitulate the paracrine actions of ASCs. By employing neutralizing antibodies and dismantling common model outputs using image analysis, the triple cell co-culture is an attractive tool for discovery of the paracrine factors in ASCs’ secretome which act in concert with VEGF to improve angiogenesis.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used to treat various inflammatory and immune-related diseases in preclinical and clinical settings. Intravital microscopy (IVM) is considered the gold standard for investigating pathophysiological conditions in living animals. However, the potential for real-time monitoring of MSCs in the pulmonary microenvironment remains underexplored. In this study, we first constructed a lung window and captured changes in the lung at the cellular level under both inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions with a microscope. We further investigated the dynamics and effects of MSCs under two different conditions. Meanwhile, we assessed the alterations in the adhesive capacity of vascular endothelial cells in vitro to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MSC retention in an inflammatory environment. This study emphasizes the importance of the “lung window” for live imaging of the cellular behavior of MSCs by vein injection. Moreover, our results revealed that the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) in endothelial cells post-inflammatory injury could enhance MSC retention in the lung, further ameliorating acute lung injury. In summary, intravital microscopy imaging provides a practical method to investigate the therapeutic effects of MSCs in acute lung injury.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) signaling influences development and homeostasis in a wide range of tissues. In the current model for aGPCR signaling, ligand binding liberates a conserved sequence that acts as an intramolecular, tethered agonist (TA), yet this model has not been evaluated systematically for all aGPCRs. Here, we assessed the TA-dependent activities of all 33 aGPCRs in a suite of transcriptional reporter, G protein activation, and β-arrestin recruitment assays using a new fusion protein platform. Strikingly, only ∼50% of aGPCRs exhibited robust TA-dependent activation, and unlike other GPCR families, aGPCRs showed a notable preference for G12/13 signaling. AlphaFold2 predictions assessing TA engagement in the predicted intramolecular binding pocket aligned with the TA dependence of the cellular responses. This dataset provides a comprehensive resource to inform the investigation of all human aGPCRs and for targeting aGPCRs therapeutically.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with cancer may be given treatments that are not officially approved (off-label) or recommended by guidelines (off-guideline). Here we present a data science framework to systematically characterize off-label and off-guideline usages using real-world data from de-identified electronic health records (EHR). We analyze treatment patterns in 165,912 US patients with 14 common cancer types. We find that 18.6% and 4.4% of patients have received at least one line of off-label and off-guideline cancer drugs, respectively. Patients with worse performance status, in later lines, or treated at academic hospitals are significantly more likely to receive off-label and off-guideline drugs. To quantify how predictable off-guideline usage is, we developed machine learning models to predict which drug a patient is likely to receive based on their clinical characteristics and previous treatments. Finally, we demonstrate that our systematic analyses generate hypotheses about patients’ response to treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation is a valuable tool for studying stem cell-niche interaction. However, the conventional approach requires the removal of endogenous SSCs, causing damage to the niche. Here we introduce WIN18,446, an ALDH1A2 inhibitor, to enhance SSC colonization in nonablated recipients. Pre-transplantation treatment with WIN18,446 induced abnormal claudin protein expression, which comprises the blood-testis barrier and impedes SSC colonization. Consequently, WIN18,446 increased colonization efficiency by 4.6-fold compared with untreated host. WIN18,446-treated testes remained small despite the cessation of WIN18,446, suggesting its irreversible effect. Offspring were born by microinsemination using donor-derived sperm. While WIN18,446 was lethal to busulfan-treated mice, cyclophosphamide- or radiation-treated animals survived after WIN18,446 treatment. Although WIN18,446 is not applicable to humans due to toxicity, similar ALDH1A2 inhibitors may be useful for SSC transplantation into nonablated testes, shedding light on the role of retinoid metabolism on SSC-niche interactions and advancing SSC research in animal models and humans.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic (dysfunction)-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the advanced stage of metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) lacking approved clinical drugs. Adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily, is mainly distributed in the central nervous system and major peripheral organs with wide-ranging physiological functions; however, the exact role of hepatic A1R in MAFLD remains unclear. Here, we report that liver-specific depletion of A1R aggravates while overexpression attenuates diet-induced metabolic-associated fatty liver (MAFL)/MASH in mice. Mechanistically, activation of hepatic A1R promotes the competitive binding of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) to sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), rather than protein kinase A (PKA) leading to SCAP degradation in lysosomes. Reduced SCAP hinders SREBP1c/2 maturation and thus suppresses de novo lipogenesis and inflammation. Higher hepatic A1R expression is observed in patients with MAFL/MASH and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, which is supposed to be a physiologically adaptive response because A1R agonists attenuate MAFL/MASH in an A1R-dependent manner. These results highlight that hepatic A1R is a potential target for MAFL/MASH therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but inconsistent responses persist. Our study delves into the intriguing phenomenon of enhanced immunotherapy sensitivity in older individuals with cancers. Through a meta-analysis encompassing 25 small-to-mid-sized trials of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), we demonstrate that older individuals exhibit heightened responsiveness to ICB therapy. To understand the underlying mechanism, we reanalyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple studies and unveil distinct upregulation of exhausted and cytotoxic T cell markers within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of older patients. Recognizing the potential role of gut microbiota in modulating the efficacy of immunotherapy, we identify an aging-enriched enterotype linked to improved immunotherapy outcomes in older patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments in mice confirm the therapeutic potential of the aging-enriched enterotype, enhancing treatment sensitivity and reshaping the TME. Our discoveries confront the prevailing paradox and provide encouraging paths for tailoring cancer immunotherapy strategies according to an individual's gut microbiome profile.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) drives inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses through engagement of its receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) on activated T cells. Overexpression of these immune checkpoint proteins in the tumor microenvironment has motivated the design of targeted antibodies that disrupt this interaction. Despite clinical success of these antibodies, response rates remain low, necessitating novel approaches to enhance performance. Here, we report the development of antibody fusion proteins that block immune checkpoint pathways through a distinct mechanism targeting molecular trafficking. By engaging multiple receptor epitopes on PD-L1, our engineered multiparatopic antibodies induce rapid clustering, internalization, and degradation in an epitope- and topology-dependent manner. The complementary mechanisms of ligand blockade and receptor downregulation led to more durable immune cell activation and dramatically reduced PD-L1 availability in mouse tumors. Collectively, these multiparatopic antibodies offer mechanistic insight into immune checkpoint protein trafficking and how it may be manipulated to reprogram immune outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq), and single-cell spatial transcriptomics to characterize murine cortical OPCs throughout postnatal life. During development, we identified two groups of differentially localized PDGFRα+ OPCs that are transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct. One group (active, or actOPCs) is metabolically active and enriched in white matter. The second (homeostatic, or hOPCs) is less active, enriched in gray matter, and predicted to derive from actOPCs. In adulthood, these two groups are transcriptionally but not epigenetically distinct, and relative to developing OPCs are less active metabolically and have less open chromatin. When adult oligodendrogenesis is enhanced during experimentally induced remyelination, adult OPCs do not reacquire a developmental open chromatin state, and the oligodendrogenesis trajectory is distinct from that seen neonatally. These data suggest that there are two OPC groups subserving distinct postnatal functions and that neonatal and adult OPC-mediated oligodendrogenesis are fundamentally different.

Abstract: Summary
Label-free imaging methodologies for nerve fibers rely on spatial signal continuity to identify fibers and fail to image free intraepidermal nerve endings (FINEs). Here, we present an imaging methodology—called discontinuity third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy (dTHGM)—that detects three-dimensional discontinuities in THG signals as the contrast. We describe the mechanism and design of dTHGM and apply it to reveal the bead-string characteristics of unmyelinated FINEs. We confirmed the label-free capability of dTHGM through a comparison study with the PGP9.5 immunohistochemical staining slides and a longitudinal spared nerve injury study. An intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) index based on a discontinuous-dot-connecting algorithm was developed to facilitate clinical applications of dTHGM. A preliminary clinical study confirmed that the IENF index was highly correlated with skin-biopsy-based IENF density (Pearson’s correlation coefficient R = 0.98) and could achieve differential identification of small-fiber neuropathy (p = 0.0102) in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present Anchored-fusion, a highly sensitive fusion gene detection tool. It anchors a gene of interest, which often involves driver fusion events, and recovers non-unique matches of short-read sequences that are typically filtered out by conventional algorithms. In addition, Anchored-fusion contains a module based on a deep learning hierarchical structure that incorporates self-distillation learning (hierarchical view learning and distillation [HVLD]), which effectively filters out false positive chimeric fragments generated during sequencing while maintaining true fusion genes. Anchored-fusion enables highly sensitive detection of fusion genes, thus allowing for application in cases with low sequencing depths. We benchmark Anchored-fusion under various conditions and found it outperformed other tools in detecting fusion events in simulated data, bulk RNA sequencing (bRNA-seq) data, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Our results demonstrate that Anchored-fusion can be a useful tool for fusion detection tasks in clinically relevant RNA-seq data and can be applied to investigate intratumor heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data.

Abstract: Summary
The histone lysine acetyltransferase KAT6B (MYST4, MORF, QKF) is the target of recurrent chromosomal translocations causing hematological malignancies with poor prognosis. Using Kat6b germline deletion and overexpression in mice, we determined the role of KAT6B in the hematopoietic system. We found that KAT6B sustained the fetal hematopoietic stem cell pool but did not affect viability or differentiation. KAT6B was essential for normal levels of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation but not for a previously proposed target, H3K23. Compound heterozygosity of Kat6b and the closely related gene, Kat6a, abolished hematopoietic reconstitution after transplantation. KAT6B and KAT6A cooperatively promoted transcription of genes regulating hematopoiesis, including the Hoxa cluster, Pbx1, Meis1, Gata family, Erg, and Flt3. In conclusion, we identified the hematopoietic processes requiring Kat6b and showed that KAT6B and KAT6A synergistically promoted HSC development, function, and transcription. Our findings are pertinent to current clinical trials testing KAT6A/B inhibitors as cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of mitochondrial function plays a crucial role in the regulation of muscle stem cell (MuSC), but the underlying mechanisms remain ill defined. In this study, we monitored mitophagy in MuSCS under various myogenic states and examined the role of PINK1 in maintaining regenerative capacity. Results indicate that quiescent MuSCs actively express mitophagy genes and exhibit a measurable mitophagy flux and prominent mitochondrial localization to autophagolysosomes, which become rapidly decreased during activation. Genetic disruption of Pink1 in mice reduces PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria and mitophagy in quiescent MuSCs, which is accompanied by premature activation/commitment at the expense of self-renewal and progressive loss of muscle regeneration, but unhindered proliferation and differentiation capacity. Results also show that impaired fate decisions in PINK1-deficient MuSCs can be restored by scavenging excess mitochondrial ROS. These data shed light on the regulation of mitophagy in MuSCs and position PINK1 as an important regulator of their mitochondrial properties and fate decisions.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecological tumors worldwide. Despite the availability of multiple treatments for ovarian cancer, its resistance to chemotherapy remains a significant challenge. miRNAs play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of cancer by affecting processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and chemoresistance. According to microarray and qPCR analyses, miR-7704 is significantly downregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells compared to parental cells. In this study, we found that miR-7704 inhibited the proliferation and promoted cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-7704 had the same effect as IL2RB knockdown. Further mechanistic studies revealed that miR-7704 played an inhibitory role by regulating IL2RB expression to inactivate the AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, IL2RB reversed the miR-7704 mediated resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer. Based on these findings, miR-7704 and IL2RB show the potential as novel therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and computed tomography (CT) are indispensable components in modern medicine. Although PET can provide additional diagnostic value, it is costly and not universally accessible, particularly in low-income countries. To bridge this gap, we have developed a conditional generative adversarial network pipeline that can produce FDG-PET from diagnostic CT scans based on multi-center multi-modal lung cancer datasets (n = 1,478). Synthetic PET images are validated across imaging, biological, and clinical aspects. Radiologists confirm comparable imaging quality and tumor contrast between synthetic and actual PET scans. Radiogenomics analysis further proves that the dysregulated cancer hallmark pathways of synthetic PET are consistent with actual PET. We also demonstrate the clinical values of synthetic PET in improving lung cancer diagnosis, staging, risk prediction, and prognosis. Taken together, this proof-of-concept study testifies to the feasibility of applying deep learning to obtain high-fidelity PET translated from CT.

Abstract: Summary
We report a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03096613) to investigate the clinical benefits of levothyroxine (L-T4) administration in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Overall, 117 patients were enrolled and received L-T4 plus standard HFrEF treatment (experimental group, N = 57) or standard HFrEF therapy alone (control group, N = 60). The change of 6-min walk test distance in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 24 weeks (70.08 ± 85.76 m vs. 27.73 ± 82.00 m, mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] 46.90 [12.90, 80.90], p < 0.001). Improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (p = 0.033) and thyroid function were significant. Adverse event incidence was similar between groups (risk ratio [95% CI]: 0.942 1.053 (0.424, 2.616); p = 0.628). L-T4 addition to HFrEF treatment improved activity tolerance, NYHA class, and thyroid function within 6 months, suggesting its potential for combined therapy in HFrEF patients with SCH. Future double-blind, placebo-controlled trials should be performed to confirm these results.

Abstract: Summary
Lung adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that exhibits a wide range of clinical radiological manifestations, from ground-glass opacity (GGO) to pure solid nodules, which vary greatly in terms of their biological characteristics. Our current understanding of this heterogeneity is limited. To address this gap, we analyze 58 lung adenocarcinoma patients via machine learning, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and whole-exome sequencing, and we identify six lung multicellular ecotypes (LMEs) correlating with distinct radiological patterns and cancer cell states. Notably, GGO-associated neoantigens in early-stage cancers are recognized by CD8+ T cells, indicating an immune-active environment, while solid nodules feature an immune-suppressive LME with exhausted CD8+ T cells, driven by specific stromal cells such as CTHCR1+ fibroblasts. This study also highlights EGFR(L858R) neoantigens in GGO samples, suggesting potential CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings offer valuable insights into lung adenocarcinoma heterogeneity, suggesting avenues for targeted therapies in early-stage disease.

Abstract: Summary
Plant roots are functionally heterogeneous in cellular architecture, transcriptome profile, metabolic state, and microbial immunity. We hypothesized that axial differentiation may also impact spatial colonization by root microbiota along the root axis. We developed two growth systems, ArtSoil and CD-Rhizotron, to grow and then dissect Arabidopsis thaliana roots into three segments. We demonstrate that distinct endospheric and rhizosphere bacterial communities colonize the segments, supporting the hypothesis of microbiota differentiation along the axis. Root metabolite profiling of each segment reveals differential metabolite enrichment and specificity. Bioinformatic analyses and GUS histochemistry indicate microbe-induced accumulation of SWEET2, 4, and 12 sugar uniporters. Profiling of root segments from sweet mutants shows altered spatial metabolic profiles and reorganization of endospheric root microbiota. This work reveals the interdependency between root metabolites and microbial colonization and the contribution of SWEETs to spatial diversity and stability of microbial ecosystem.
Keywords: root microbiota; spatial rhizobiota organization; spatial metabolite patterning; SWEET sugar transporter; microbe-metabolite interdependency

Abstract: Summary
This study describes the identification and target deconvolution of small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic Yes-associated protein (YAP1)/TAZ activity with potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. A high-throughput screen (HTS) of 3.8 million compounds was conducted using a cellular YAP1/TAZ reporter assay. Target deconvolution studies identified the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) complex as the direct target of YAP1/TAZ pathway inhibitors. The small molecule inhibitors block the activation of Rho-GTPases, leading to subsequent inactivation of YAP1/TAZ and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Multi-parameter optimization resulted in BAY-593, an in vivo probe with favorable PK properties, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity and blockade of YAP1/TAZ signaling in vivo.

Abstract: The heightened prevalence and accelerated progression of periodontitis in individuals with diabetes is primarily attributed to inflammatory responses in human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLCs). This study is aimed at delineating the regulatory mechanism of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) in mediating inflammation incited by muramyl dipeptide (MDP) in HPDLCs, under the influence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), metabolic by-products associated with diabetes. We performed RNA-seq in HPDLCs induced by AGEs treatment and delineated activation markers for the receptor of AGEs (RAGE). It showed that advanced glycation end products modulate inflammatory responses in HPDLCs by activating NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes, which are further regulated through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, AGEs synergize with NOD2, NLRP1, and NLRP3 inflammasomes to augment MDP-induced inflammation significantly.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue regeneration following an injury requires dynamic cell-state transitions that allow for establishing the cell identities required for the restoration of tissue homeostasis and function. Here, we present a biochemical intervention that induces an intermediate cell state mirroring a transition identified during normal differentiation of myoblasts and other multipotent and pluripotent cells to mature cells. When applied in somatic differentiated cells, the intervention, composed of one-carbon metabolites, reduces some dedifferentiation markers without losing the lineage identity, thus inducing limited reprogramming into a more flexible cell state. Moreover, the intervention enabled accelerated repair after muscle injury in young and aged mice. Overall, our study uncovers a conserved biochemical transitional phase that enhances cellular plasticity in vivo and hints at potential and scalable biochemical interventions of use in regenerative medicine and rejuvenation interventions that may be more tractable than genetic ones.

Abstract: Summary
When designing new conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), major efforts are typically focused on selecting specific linkages and variations of building blocks to control their terminal structure and function. However, the constitutional isomerism of CMPs has seldom been considered so far as a crucial aspect. Herein, we successfully synthesize a pair of isomeric CMPs, named DBP-TEP (with phenanthrenequinone units) and DBQ-TEP (with anthraquinone units). Benefiting from the construction of the extended D-π-A conjugated skeleton, our isomeric CMPs are characterized by low band gaps and high charge transport efficiency, thus remarkably enhancing uranium photoreduction performance. Interestingly, the experiment results show that the adsorption capacity of DBP-TEP is 1.5 times that of DBQ-TEP under light irradiation. Additionally, both experiments in real-life and theoretical calculations prove that the phenanthrenonequinone unit does have a profound effect on the photocatalytic activity, which is predominantly attributed to the stronger electronic push-pull system and higher π-conjugated system in DBP-TEP.

Abstract: Summary
The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) involves complex gene regulatory changes across different cell types. To help decipher this complexity, we introduce single-cell Bayesian biclustering (scBC), a framework for identifying cell-specific gene network biomarkers in scRNA and snRNA-seq data. Through biclustering, scBC enables the analysis of perturbations in functional gene modules at the single-cell level. Applying the scBC framework to AD snRNA-seq data reveals the perturbations within gene modules across distinct cell groups and sheds light on gene-cell correlations during AD progression. Notably, our method helps to overcome common challenges in single-cell data analysis, including batch effects and dropout events. Incorporating prior knowledge further enables the framework to yield more biologically interpretable results. Comparative analyses on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the precision and robustness of our approach compared to other state-of-the-art biclustering methods. scBC holds potential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying polygenic diseases characterized by intricate gene coexpression patterns.

Abstract: Protein misfolding and mislocalization are common themes in neurodegenerative disorders, including motor neuron disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Maintaining proteostasis is a crosscutting therapeutic target, including the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSP) to increase chaperoning capacity. Motor neurons have a high threshold for upregulating stress-inducible HSPA1A, but constitutively express high levels of HSPA8. This study compared the expression of these HSPs in cultured motor neurons expressing three variants linked to familial ALS: TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43)G348C, fused in sarcoma (FUS)R521G, or superoxide dismutase I (SOD1)G93A. All variants were poor inducers of Hspa1a, and reduced levels of Hspa8 mRNA and protein, indicating multiple compromises in chaperoning capacity. To promote HSP expression, cultures were treated with the putative HSP coinducer, arimoclomol, and class I histone deacetylase inhibitors, to promote active chromatin for transcription, and with the combination. Treatments had variable, often different effects on the expression of Hspa1a and Hspa8, depending on the ALS variant expressed, mRNA distribution (somata and dendrites), and biomarker of toxicity measured (histone acetylation, maintaining nuclear TDP-43 and the neuronal Brm/Brg-associated factor chromatin remodeling complex component Brg1, mitochondrial transport, FUS aggregation). Overall, histone deacetylase inhibition alone was effective on more measures than arimoclomol. As in the FUS model, arimoclomol failed to induce HSPA1A or preserve Hspa8 mRNA in the TDP-43 model, despite preserving nuclear TDP-43 and Brg1, indicating neuroprotective properties other than HSP induction. The data speak to the complexity of drug mechanisms against multiple biomarkers of ALS pathogenesis, as well as to the importance of HSPA8 for neuronal proteostasis in both somata and dendrites.

Abstract: Plasma saturated free fatty acid (FFA)-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED) contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanism underlying saturated FFA-induced ED remains unclear. This study demonstrated that palmitic acid (PA) induced ED by activating the NADPH oxidase (NOX)/ROS signaling pathway to activate protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thereby reducing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at Ser633 and Ser1177, respectively. Okadaic acid (OA) and fostriecin (FST), which are inhibitors of PP2A, inhibited the PA-induced decreases in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser633 and Ser1177. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and apocynin (APO) or knockdown of gp91phox or p67phox (NOX subunits) restored PA-mediated downregulation of PP4R2 protein expression and eNOS Ser633 phosphorylation. Knockdown of the PP4 catalytic subunit (PP4c) specifically increased eNOS Ser633 phosphorylation, while silencing the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) restored only eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation. Furthermore, PA dramatically decreased the protein expression of the PP4 regulatory subunit R2 (PP4R2) but not the other regulatory subunits. PP4R2 overexpression increased eNOS Ser633 phosphorylation, nitric oxide (NO) production, cell migration and tube formation but did not change eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation levels. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) suggested that PP4R2 and PP4c interacted with the PP4R3α and eNOS proteins. In summary, PA decreases PP4R2 protein expression through the Nox/ROS pathway to activate PP4, which contributes to ED by dephosphorylating eNOS at Ser633. The results of this study suggest that PP4 is a novel therapeutic target for ED and ED-associated vascular diseases.

Abstract: It was reported that within the head and neck cancer (HNC) cell line CAL21 the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferation were promoted by Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator (PLAU) proteinase through TNFRSF12A. Additionally, in this paper HNC cell lines refer to Fadu and Tu686. A novel PLAU-STAT3 axis was found to be involved in HNC cell line proliferation and metastasis. PLAU expression in HNC samples was upregulated, besides, the elevated expression of PLAU was linked to the lower overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Ectopic PLAU expression promoted cell proliferation and migration, while PLAU knockdown exhibited opposite results. RNA-seq data identified the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, confirmed by western blotting. A recovery assay using S3I-201, a selective inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), indicated that PLAU promoted HNC cell line progression via STAT3 signaling in vitro. The oncogenic role of PLAU in HNC tumor growth in vivo was confirmed using xenograft models. In summary, we identified the tumorigenic PLAU function in the HNC progress. PLAU may represent a potential prognostic biomarker of HNC and the PLAU-STAT3 pathway might be considered a therapeutic target of HNC.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has an essential but largely undefined role in maintaining proteostasis in Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria parasite. Herein, we identify BX-2819 and XL888 as potent P. falciparum (Pf)Hsp90 inhibitors. Derivatization of XL888’s scaffold led to the development of Tropane 1, as a PfHsp90-selective binder with nanomolar affinity. Hsp90 inhibitors exhibit anti-Plasmodium activity against the liver, asexual blood, and early gametocyte life stages. Thermal proteome profiling was implemented to assess PfHsp90-dependent proteome stability, and the proteasome—the main site of cellular protein recycling—was enriched among proteins with perturbed stability upon PfHsp90 inhibition. Subsequent biochemical and cellular studies suggest that PfHsp90 directly promotes proteasome hydrolysis by chaperoning the active 26S complex. These findings expand our knowledge of the PfHsp90-dependent proteome and protein quality control mechanisms in these pathogenic parasites, as well as further characterize this chaperone as a potential antimalarial drug target.

Abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancies characterized by abnormal hematopoietic cell maturation, increased apoptosis of bone marrow cells, and anemia. They are the most common myeloid blood cancers in American adults. The full complement of gene mutations that contribute to the phenotypes or clinical symptoms in MDS is not fully understood. Around 10%–25% of MDS patients harbor an interstitial heterozygous deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 [del(5q)], creating haploinsufficiency for a large set of genes, including HSPA9. The HSPA9 gene encodes for the protein mortalin, a highly conserved heat shock protein predominantly localized in mitochondria. Our prior study showed that knockdown of HSPA9 induces TP53-dependent apoptosis in human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this study, we explored the role of HSPA9 in regulating erythroid maturation using human CD34+ cells. We inhibited the expression of HSPA9 using gene knockdown and pharmacological inhibition and found that inhibition of HSPA9 disrupted erythroid maturation as well as increased expression of p53 in CD34+ cells. To test whether the molecular mechanism of HSPA9 regulating erythroid maturation is TP53-dependent, we knocked down HSPA9 and TP53 individually or in combination in human CD34+ cells. We found that the knockdown of TP53 partially rescued the erythroid maturation defect induced by HSPA9 knockdown, suggesting that the defect in cells with reduced HSPA9 expression is TP53-dependent. Collectively, these findings indicate that reduced levels of HSPA9 may contribute to the anemia observed in del(5q)-associated MDS patients due to the activation of TP53.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome is associated with pathological neurophysiological evolvement in extremely premature infants suffering from brain injury. The exact underlying mechanism and its associated metabolic signatures in infants are not fully understood. To decipher metabolite profiles linked to neonatal brain injury, we investigate the fecal and plasma metabolome of samples obtained from a cohort of 51 extremely premature infants at several time points, using liquid chromatography (LC)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics and LC-MS/MS-based targeted analysis for investigating bile acids and amidated bile acid conjugates. The data are integrated with 16S rRNA gene amplicon gut microbiome profiles as well as patient cytokine, growth factor, and T cell profiles. We find an early onset of differentiation in neuroactive metabolites between infants with and without brain injury. We detect several bacterially derived bile acid amino acid conjugates in plasma and feces. These results provide insights into the early-life metabolome of extremely premature infants.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic conditions characterized by periods of spontaneous intestinal inflammation and are increasing in industrialized populations. Combined with host genetics, diet and gut bacteria are thought to contribute prominently to IBDs, but mechanisms are still emerging. In mice lacking the IBD-associated cytokine, interleukin-10, we show that a fiber-deprived gut microbiota promotes the deterioration of colonic mucus, leading to lethal colitis. Inflammation starts with the expansion of natural killer cells and altered immunoglobulin-A coating of some bacteria. Lethal colitis is then driven by Th1 immune responses to increased activities of mucin-degrading bacteria that cause inflammation first in regions with thinner mucus. A fiber-free exclusive enteral nutrition diet also induces mucus erosion but inhibits inflammation by simultaneously increasing an anti-inflammatory bacterial metabolite, isobutyrate. Our findings underscore the importance of focusing on microbial functions—not taxa—contributing to IBDs and that some diet-mediated functions can oppose those that promote disease.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and life-threatening brain tumor, characterized by its highly malignant and recurrent nature. DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM-1) is a p53 target gene encoding a lysosomal protein that induces macro-autophagy and damage-induced programmed cell death in tumor growth. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how DRAM-1 affects tumor cell proliferation through regulation of lysosomal function and autophagic flux stability remain incompletely understood. We found that DRAM-1 expressions were evidently down-regulated in high-grade glioma and recurrent GBM tissues. The upregulation of DRAM-1 could increase mortality of primary cultured GBM cells. TEM analysis revealed an augmented accumulation of aberrant lysosomes in DRAM-1-overexpressing GBM cells. The assay for lysosomal pH and stability also demonstrated decreasing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and impaired lysosomal acidity. Further research revealed the detrimental impact of lysosomal dysfunction, which impaired the autophagic flux stability and ultimately led to GBM cell death. Moreover, downregulation of mTOR phosphorylation was observed in GBM cells following upregulation of DRAM-1. In vivo and in vitro experiments additionally illustrated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin increased GBM cell mortality and exhibited an enhanced antitumor effect.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 Nef accessory factor enhances the viral life cycle in vivo, promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells, and represents an attractive antiretroviral drug target. However, Nef lacks enzymatic activity and an active site, complicating traditional occupancy-based drug development. Here we describe the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the targeted degradation of Nef. Nef-binding compounds, based on an existing hydroxypyrazole core, were coupled to ligands for ubiquitin E3 ligases via flexible linkers. The resulting bivalent PROTACs induced formation of a ternary complex between Nef and the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase thalidomide-binding domain in vitro and triggered Nef degradation in a T cell expression system. Nef-directed PROTACs efficiently rescued Nef-mediated MHC-I and CD4 downregulation in T cells and suppressed HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. Targeted degradation is anticipated to reverse all HIV-1 Nef functions and may help restore adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 reservoir cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Microbiomes feature complex interactions between diverse bacteria and bacteriophages. Synthetic microbiomes offer a powerful way to study these interactions; however, a major challenge is obtaining a representative bacteriophage population during the bacterial isolation process. We demonstrate that colony isolation reliably excludes virulent viruses from sample sources with low virion-to-bacteria ratios such as feces, creating “virulent virus-free” controls. When the virulent dsDNA virome is reintroduced to a 73-strain synthetic gut microbiome in a bioreactor model of the human colon, virulent viruses target susceptible strains without significantly altering community structure or metabolism. In addition, we detected signals of prophage induction that associate with virulent predation. Overall, our findings indicate that dilution-based isolation methods generate synthetic gut microbiomes that are heavily depleted, if not devoid, of virulent viruses and that such viruses, if reintroduced, have a targeted effect on community assembly, metabolism, and prophage replication.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification (MNA) is a high-risk disease that has a poor survival rate. Neuroblastoma displays cellular heterogeneity, including more differentiated (adrenergic) and more primitive (mesenchymal) cellular states. Here, we demonstrate that MYCN oncoprotein promotes a cellular state switch in mesenchymal cells to an adrenergic state, accompanied by induction of histone lysine demethylase 4 family members (KDM4A-C) that act in concert to control the expression of MYCN and adrenergic core regulatory circulatory (CRC) transcription factors. Pharmacologic inhibition of KDM4 blocks expression of MYCN and the adrenergic CRC transcriptome with genome-wide induction of transcriptionally repressive H3K9me3, resulting in potent anticancer activity against neuroblastomas with MNA by inducing neuroblastic differentiation and apoptosis. Furthermore, a short-term KDM4 inhibition in combination with conventional, cytotoxic chemotherapy results in complete tumor responses of xenografts with MNA. Thus, KDM4 blockade may serve as a transformative strategy to target the adrenergic CRC dependencies in MNA neuroblastomas.

Abstract: Summary
The use of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib achieves a remarkable clinical response in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Acquired drug resistance, however, is significant and affects long-term survival of MCL patients. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is involved in ibrutinib resistance. We find that DNMT3A expression is upregulated upon ibrutinib treatment in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. Genetic and pharmacological analyses reveal that DNMT3A mediates ibrutinib resistance independent of its DNA-methylation function. Mechanistically, DNMT3A induces the expression of MYC target genes through interaction with the transcription factors MEF2B and MYC, thus mediating metabolic reprogramming to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Targeting DNMT3A with low-dose decitabine inhibits the growth of ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma cells both in vitro and in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. These findings suggest that targeting DNMT3A-mediated metabolic reprogramming to OXPHOS with decitabine provides a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome ibrutinib resistance in relapsed/refractory MCL.

Abstract: Summary
Insertion sequence (IS) elements are mobile genetic elements in bacterial genomes that support adaptation. We developed a database of IS elements coupled to a computational pipeline that identifies IS element insertions in the microbiota. We discovered that diverse IS elements insert into the genomes of intestinal bacteria regardless of human host lifestyle. These insertions target bacterial accessory genes that aid in their adaptation to unique environmental conditions. Using IS expansion in Bacteroides, we show that IS activity leads to the insertion of “hot spots” in accessory genes. We show that IS insertions are stable and can be transferred between humans. Extreme environmental perturbations force IS elements to fall out of the microbiota, and many fail to rebound following homeostasis. Our work shows that IS elements drive bacterial genome diversification within the microbiota and establishes a framework for understanding how strain-level variation within the microbiota impacts human health.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue infiltration by circulating leukocytes occurs via adhesive interactions with the local vasculature, but how the adhesive quality of circulating cells guides the homing of specific phenotypes to different vascular microenvironments remains undefined. We developed an optofluidic system enabling fluorescent labeling of photoactivatable cells based on their adhesive rolling velocity in an inflamed vasculature-mimicking microfluidic device under physiological fluid flow. In so doing, single-cell level multidimensional profiling of cellular characteristics could be characterized and related to the associated adhesive phenotype. When applied to CD8+ T cells, ligand/receptor expression profiles and subtypes associated with adhesion were revealed, providing insight into inflamed tissue infiltration capabilities of specific CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets and how local vascular microenvironmental features may regulate the quality of cellular infiltration. This methodology facilitates rapid screening of cell populations for enhanced homing capabilities under defined biochemical and biophysical microenvironments, relevant to leukocyte homing modulation in multiple pathologies.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested exosomes (EXO) as potential therapeutic tools for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis (AS). This study investigates the function of bone marrow stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes (EXO) on macrophage pyroptosis in AS and explores the associated mechanism. BMSC-EXO were isolated from healthy mice and identified. RAW264.7 cells (mouse macrophages) were exposed to oxLDL to simulate an AS condition. BMSC-EXO treatment enhanced viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release of macrophages. An animal model of AS was established using ApoE−/− mice. BMSC-EXO treatment suppressed plaque formation as well as macrophage and lipid infiltration in mouse aortic tissues. Moreover, BMSC-EXO decreased concentrations of pyroptosis-related markers interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, cleaved-caspase-1 and gasdermin D in vitro and in vivo. Long non-coding RNA AU020206 was carried by the BMSC-EXO, and it bound to CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) to block CEBPB-mediated transcriptional activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). Functional assays revealed that silencing of AU020206 aggravated macrophage pyroptosis and exacerbated AS symptoms in mice. These exacerbations were blocked upon CEBPB silencing but then restored after NLRP3 overexpression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AU020206 delivered by BMSC-EXO alleviates macrophage pyroptosis in AS by blocking CEBPB-mediated transcriptional activation of NLRP3.

Abstract: Summary
Systems vaccinology studies have identified factors affecting individual vaccine responses, but comparing these findings is challenging due to varying study designs. To address this lack of reproducibility, we established a community resource for comparing Bordetella pertussis booster responses and to host annual contests for predicting patients' vaccination outcomes. We report here on our experiences with the “dry-run” prediction contest. We found that, among 20+ models adopted from the literature, the most successful model predicting vaccination outcome was based on age alone. This confirms our concerns about the reproducibility of conclusions between different vaccinology studies. Further, we found that, for newly trained models, handling of baseline information on the target variables was crucial. Overall, multiple co-inertia analysis gave the best results of the tested modeling approaches. Our goal is to engage community in these prediction challenges by making data and models available and opening a public contest in August 2024.

TGF-α/EGFR signaling promotes lipopolysaccharide-induced abnormal elastin deposition and alveolar simplification,

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by shortened secondary septa and fewer, larger alveoli. Elastin deposition to the distal tips of the secondary septa is critical for elongation of the secondary septa. Alveolar myofibroblasts, which are thought to migrate to the septal tips during alveolarization, are mainly responsible for elastin production and deposition. Antenatal exposure to inflammation induces abnormal elastin deposition, thereby increasing the risk of developing BPD. Here, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the expression of transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) in an LPS-induced rat model of BPD and in LPS-treated human pulmonary epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). In addition, in vitro experiments suggested that LPS upregulated TGF-α expression via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE) signaling. Increased TGF-α levels via its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced lysyl oxidase (LOX) overactivation and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) activity inhibition of myofibroblasts. Similarly, in vivo LOX overactivation and inhibition of Cdc42 activity were observed in the lungs of LPS-exposed pups. LOX overactivation led to abnormal elastin deposition, and inhibition of Cdc42 activity disturbed the directional migration of myofibroblasts and disrupted elastin localization. Most importantly, the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib partially rescued LOX overactivation and Cdc42 activity inhibition, and improved elastin deposition and alveolar development in antenatal LPS-treated rats. Taken together, our data suggest that TGF-α/EGFR signaling is critically involved in the regulation of elastin deposition and represents a novel therapeutic target.

Abstract: Objective
Our objective was to study the frequency of circulating LAG-3+ and PD-1+ T cells in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and their correlation with cytokines and patient prognosis.
Methods
A total of 83 patients with CKD between June 2020 and June 2022 were enrolled. We measured serum levels of IL-6, CRP, IL-1β, and TNF-α by ELISA. The frequency of PD-1+ and LAG-3+ T cells was measured using flow cytometry. All patients were followed up for 1 year, and the occurrence of any of the following conditions during the follow-up period was considered as major adverse cardiac events (MACE) indicating poor prognosis.
Results
The frequencies of LAG-3+PD-1+, LAG-3+ and PD-1+ cells were significantly increased in CKD group compared to healthy volunteers. Additionally, CKD patients had remarkably enhanced levels of cytokines. Compared to the non-MACE group, MACE group had significantly higher frequencies of LAG-3PD-1, LAG-3 and PD-1 expression on CD8 and CD4. Positive correlations were observed between IL-1β, IL-6 and frequencies of PD-1+LAG-3+. CD4+LAG-3+PD-1+ frequency displayed the highest diagnostic value for CKD patients with MACE. Moreover, CD8+LAG-3+, CD4+LAG-3+PD-1+, CD4+PD-1+, IL-1β and IL-6 were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of MACE in patients with CKD.
Conclusion
In summary, the present research showed that the frequencies of LAG-3+ and PD-1+ T cells were remarkably enhanced in CKD patients. These findings offer novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for the management of CKD.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Durable responses, however, are observed only in a subpopulation of patients. Defective antigen presentation and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to deficient T cell recruitment and ICB resistance. We evaluate intratumoral (IT) vaccination with CXCL9- and CXCL10-engineered dendritic cells (CXCL9/10-DC) as a strategy to overcome resistance. IT CXCL9/10-DC leads to enhanced T cell infiltration and activation in the TME and tumor inhibition in murine NSCLC models. The antitumor efficacy of IT CXCL9/10-DC is dependent on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as CXCR3-dependent T cell trafficking from the lymph node. IT CXCL9/10-DC, in combination with ICB, overcomes resistance and establishes systemic tumor-specific immunity in murine models. These studies provide a mechanistic understanding of CXCL9/10-DC-mediated host immune activation and support clinical translation of IT CXCL9/10-DC to augment ICB efficacy in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Nipah virus (NiV) has been recently ranked by the World Health Organization as being among the top eight emerging pathogens likely to cause major epidemics, whereas no therapeutics or vaccines have yet been approved. We report a method to deliver immunogenic epitopes from NiV through the targeting of the CD40 receptor of antigen-presenting cells by fusing a selected humanized anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody to the Nipah glycoprotein with conserved NiV fusion and nucleocapsid peptides. In the African green monkey model, CD40.NiV induces specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG as well as cross-neutralizing responses against circulating NiV strains and Hendra virus and T cell responses. Challenge experiments using a NiV-B strain demonstrate the high protective efficacy of the vaccine, with all vaccinated animals surviving and showing no significant clinical signs or virus replication, suggesting that the CD40.NiV vaccine conferred sterilizing immunity. Overall, results obtained with the CD40.NiV vaccine are highly promising in terms of the breadth and efficacy against NiV.

Abstract: Summary
Pesticides may help safeguard food security but endanger the local ecosystem and farmer health. The globalization of the food trade is masking such impacts by separating production from consumption, and its effects on pesticide use and their related risks remain unclear. Here, we provide a map of the environmental and health risks associated with pesticide footprints along the soybean trade across 197 countries. We find that approximately 64% of soybeans were traded globally, embodying ∼55% of environmental-health risks linked to ∼108 kt of pesticide use. Notably, trade soybean pesticide footprints and their associated environmental-health risks are concentrated in a few hotspot nations, including the USA, Brazil, and Argentina. About 30 kt of future increase in soybean pesticide use and ∼6% of their related environmental-health risks can be offset by reducing 80% of soybean traded from high-pesticide-use-intensity nations to lower ones. Our results highlight the necessity of rethinking the role of agricultural trade in global pesticide management.

Abstract: Summary
To spread within a host, intracellular Burkholderia form actin tails to generate membrane protrusions into neighboring host cells and use type VI secretion system-5 (T6SS-5) to induce cell-cell fusions. Here, we show that B. thailandensis also uses T6SS-5 to lyse protrusions to directly spread from cell to cell. Dynamin-2 recruitment to the membrane near a bacterium was followed by a short burst of T6SS-5 activity. This resulted in the polymerization of the actin of the newly invaded host cell and disruption of the protrusion membrane. Most protrusion lysis events were dependent on dynamin activity, caused no cell-cell fusion, and failed to be recognized by galectin-3. T6SS-5 inactivation decreased protrusion lysis but increased galectin-3, LC3, and LAMP1 accumulation in host cells. Our results indicate that B. thailandensis specifically activates T6SS-5 assembly in membrane protrusions to disrupt host cell membranes and spread without alerting cellular responses, such as autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the dynamic interplay between the human microbiome and host during health and disease, we analyzed the microbial composition, temporal dynamics, and associations with host multi-omics, immune, and clinical markers of microbiomes from four body sites in 86 participants over 6 years. We found that microbiome stability and individuality are body-site specific and heavily influenced by the host. The stool and oral microbiome are more stable than the skin and nasal microbiomes, possibly due to their interaction with the host and environment. We identify individual-specific and commonly shared bacterial taxa, with individualized taxa showing greater stability. Interestingly, microbiome dynamics correlate across body sites, suggesting systemic dynamics influenced by host-microbial-environment interactions. Notably, insulin-resistant individuals show altered microbial stability and associations among microbiome, molecular markers, and clinical features, suggesting their disrupted interaction in metabolic disease. Our study offers comprehensive views of multi-site microbial dynamics and their relationship with host health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Several clinical trials are underway investigating cell and gene therapy, and while these trials are meant to significantly impact patient care, they rely on patient engagement and participation. Unfortunately, clinical trials generally require extensive commitment by subjects. While several studies are using validated surveys to measure patient-reported outcomes, there is a lack of characterization of the patient experience as a subject in these trials. As such, we surveyed mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) trial participants to understand their perspective. We found that there exists a reliance on one’s gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeons for trial introduction and that time and cost were the main barriers to participation. Overall, participants demonstrated high satisfaction with MSC trial participation, but future protocols could incorporate increased use of virtual appointments to optimize patient experience.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the exact causes and mechanisms behind OA are still not fully understood, resulting in a lack of effective treatments to slow down or halt disease progression. Recent research has discovered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in the circulation of young mice have a remarkable ability to activate musculoskeletal stem cells in elderly mice. Conversely, EVs derived from elderly mice do not exhibit the same potential, indicating that EVs obtained from young individuals may hold promise to activate aging cells in degenerative tissue. However, it remains unknown whether EVs derived from young individuals can also address cartilage degeneration caused by aging. In this study, we first evaluated EVs derived from young human plasma (YEVs) and EVs derived from old human plasma (OEVs) in an in vitro experiment using chondrocytes. The results revealed that YEVs effectively stimulated chondrocyte proliferation and migration, while OEVs from old plasma did not exhibit a similar effect. Given that OA represents a more complex inflammatory microenvironment, we further determine whether the benefits of YEVs on chondrocytes can be maintained in this context. Our findings indicate that YEVs have the ability to positively regulate chondrocyte function and protect them against apoptosis induced by IL-1β and TNF-α in an in vitro OA model. Furthermore, we discovered that lyophilized EVs could be stored under mild conditions without any alterations in their physical characteristics. Considering the exceptional therapeutic effects and the wide availability of EVs from young plasma, they hold significant promise as a potential approach to activate chondrocytes and promote cartilage regeneration in early-stage OA.

Abstract: Background
Hepatic fibrosis, a common pathological process that occurs in end-stage liver diseases, is a serious public health problem and lacks effective therapy. Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1) is a small molecule derived from the traditional Chinese medicine Sanqi, exhibiting great potential in treating diverse metabolie disorders. Here we aimed to enquired the role of NR1 in liver fibrosis and its underlying mechanism in hepatoprotective effects.
Methods
We investigated the anti-fibrosis effect of NR1 using CCl4-induced mouse mode of liver fibrosis as well as TGF-β1-activated JS-1, LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cell. Cell samples treated by NR1 were collected for transcriptomic profiling analysis. PPAR-γ mediated TGF-β1/Smads signaling was examined using PPAR-γ selective inhibitors and agonists intervention, immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Additionally, we designed and studied the binding of NR1 to PPAR-γ using molecular docking.
Results
NR1 obviously attenuated liver histological damage, reduced serum ALT, AST levels, and decreased liver fibrogenesis markers in mouse mode. Mechanistically, NR1 elevated PPAR-γ and decreased TGF-β1, p-Smad2/3 expression. The TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway and fibrotic phenotype were altered in JS-1 cells after using PPAR-γ selective inhibitors and agonists respectively, confirming PPAR-γ played a pivotal protection role inNR1 treating liver fibrosis. Further molecular docking indicated NR1 had a strong binding tendency to PPAR-γ with minimum free energy.
Conclusions
NR1 attenuates hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatic fibrosis by elevating PPAR-γ to inhibit TGF-β1/Smads signalling. NR1 may be a potential candidate compound for reliving liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Certain oncogenes, including mutant RAS and BRAF, induce a type of senescence known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) in normal cells in a cell-type-specific manner. OIS serves as a barrier to transformation by activated oncogenes. Our previous studies showed that mutant KRASV12 did not efficiently induce OIS in an hTERT/Cdk4-immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3), but it did enhance both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth. In this study, we investigated whether mutant BRAF, a well-known inducer of OIS, could trigger OIS in HBEC3 cells. We also assessed the impact of mutant BRAF on the growth of HBEC3 cells, as no previous studies have examined this using a normal bronchial epithelial cell line model. We established an HBEC3 cell line, designated as HBEC3-BIN, that expresses mutant BRAFV600E in a doxycycline-regulated manner. Unlike our previous finding that KRASV12 upregulated both pERK and pAKT, mutant BRAFV600E upregulated pERK but not pAKT in HBEC3-BIN cells. Similar to KRASV12, BRAFV600E did not efficiently induce OIS. Interestingly, while BRAFV600E inhibited colony formation in anchorage-dependent conditions, it dramatically enhanced colony formation in anchorage-independent conditions in HBEC3-BIN. In HBEC3 cells without BRAFV600E or KRASV12 expression, p21 was only detected in the cytoplasm, and its localization was not altered by the expression of BRAFV600E or KRASV12. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed an enrichment of gene sets known to be involved in carcinogenesis, including IL3/JAK/STAT3, IL2, STAT5, and the EMT pathway. Our results indicate that, unlike KRASV12, which promoted both, BRAFV600E enhances anchorage-independent growth but inhibits anchorage-dependent growth of HBEC3. This contrast may result from differences in activation signaling in the downstream pathways. Furthermore, HBEC3 cells appear to be inherently resistant to OIS, which may be partly due to the fact that p21 remains localized in the cytoplasm upon expression of BRAFV600E or KRASV12.

Abstract: The altered protein expression of inverted CCAAT box-binding protein of 90 kDa/ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (ICBP90/UHRF1), and Np95-like ring finger protein (NIRF)/UHRF2, which belong to the ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains (UHRF) family, is linked to tumor malignancy and the progression of various cancers. In this study, we analyzed the UHRF family expression in cervical cancers, and it's regulation by human papillomavirus (HPV). Western blotting was performed to analyze protein expression in cervical cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis were used to investigate the expression of UHRF family and MIB-1 in cervical cancer tissues. Transfection were done for analyze the relationship between UHRF family and HPVs. We showed that NIRF expression was decreased and ICBP90 expression was increased in cervical cancers compared to normal counterparts. Western blotting also showed that NIRF expression was quite low levels, but ICBP90 was high in human cervical cancer cell lines. Interestingly, ICBP90 was up regulated by high risk type HPV16 E6 and E7, but not low-risk type HPV11. On the other hand, NIRF was down regulated by high risk type HPV16 E6 but not by E7. Low risk type HPV11 E6 did not affect the NIRF expression at all. We propose that ICBP90 overexpression, and reduced NIRF expression, found in cervical cancers, is an important event of a cervical carcinogenesis, and especially ICBP90 may offer a proliferating marker and therapeutic target for treating uterine cervical cancers.

Abstract: Summary
KN046, a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and CTLA-4, presents a promising therapeutic option for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this multicenter phase 2 trial, patients with nonsquamous (non-sq) NSCLC receive pemetrexed, whereas those with sq-NSCLC receive paclitaxel, plus KN046 and carboplatin. Following four cycles, maintenance therapy includes KN046 with pemetrexed for non-sq-NSCLC and KN046 for sq-NSCLC. The objective response rate is 46.0%, and the median duration of response is 8.1 months. The median progression-free and overall survival are 5.8 and 26.6 months, respectively. The common adverse events include anemia (87.4%), loss of appetite (72.4%), and neutropenia (70.1%). The most prevalent immune-related adverse event is pruritus (28.7%). These findings indicate that first-line treatment with KN046 and chemotherapy is effective and tolerable in metastatic NSCLC patients, warranting further investigation in a larger phase 3 trial. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04054531).

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common and deadly form of lung cancer, with high rates of metastasis and unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Herein, we examined the influence of TMEM158 on the LUAD progression. A combination of bioinformatic analyses was used to assess the TMEM158 expression pattern, prognostic implications, and potential function in LUAD. The levels of TMEM158 and TWIST1 were evaluated in clinical samples from LUAD patients using Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. To discover the function and underlying molecular pathways of TMEM158 in LUAD, we employed a combination of experimental approaches in vitro, such as flow cytometry analysis and colony formation, Co-IP, CCK-8, Transwell, and wound-healing assays. Elevated expression of TMEM158 in LUAD is associated with increased cancer aggressiveness and a poor prognosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that high levels of TMEM158 promote cell proliferation, progression through the cell cycle, migration, and invasion while suppressing apoptosis. Knockdown of TMEM158 produced opposite effects. The underlying mechanism involves TMEM158 and TWIST1 directly interacting, stimulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in LUAD cells. This investigation emphasizes the molecular functions of TMEM158 in LUAD progression and proposes targeting it as a promising treatment approach for managing LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous and infiltrative form of brain cancer associated with a poor outcome and limited therapeutic effectiveness. The extent of the surgery is related to survival. Reaching an accurate diagnosis and prognosis assessment by the time of the initial surgery is therefore paramount in the management of glioblastoma. To this end, we are studying the performance of SpiderMass, an ambient ionization mass spectrometry technology that can be used in vivo without invasiveness, coupled to our recently established artificial intelligence pipeline. We demonstrate that we can both stratify isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type glioblastoma patients into molecular sub-groups and achieve an accurate diagnosis with over 90% accuracy after cross-validation. Interestingly, the developed method offers the same accuracy for prognosis. In addition, we are testing the potential of an immunoscoring strategy based on SpiderMass fingerprints, showing the association between prognosis and immune cell infiltration, to predict patient outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common forms of hereditary neurodegeneration. It is caused by one or more of at least 3,100 mutations in over 80 genes that are primarily expressed in rod photoreceptors. In RP, the primary rod-death phase is followed by cone death, regardless of the underlying gene mutation that drove the initial rod degeneration. Dampening the oxidation of glycolytic end products in rod mitochondria enhances cone survival in divergent etiological disease models independent of the underlying rod-specific gene mutations. Therapeutic editing of the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein gene (PHD2, also known as Egln1) in rod photoreceptors led to the sustained survival of both diseased rods and cones in both preclinical autosomal-recessive and dominant RP models. Adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR-based therapeutic reprogramming of the aerobic glycolysis node may serve as a gene-agnostic treatment for patients with various forms of RP.

Abstract: Summary
In monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, mutations in genes regulating innate immune responses often lead to uncontrolled activation of inflammasome pathways or the type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We describe a mechanism of autoinflammation potentially predisposing patients to life-threatening necrotizing soft tissue inflammation. Six unrelated families are identified in which affected members present with necrotizing fasciitis or severe soft tissue inflammations. Exome sequencing reveals truncating monoallelic loss-of-function variants of nuclear factor κ light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFKB1) in affected patients. In patients’ macrophages and in NFKB1-variant-bearing THP-1 cells, activation increases both interleukin (IL)-1β secretion and IFN-I signaling. Truncation of NF-κB1 impairs autophagy, accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced degradation of inflammasome receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF), thus leading to combined excessive inflammasome and IFN-I activity. Many of the patients respond to anti-inflammatory treatment, and targeting IL-1β and/or IFN-I signaling could represent a therapeutic approach for these patients.

Abstract: Summary
Subvariants of the Omicron lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) efficiently escape neutralizing antibody responses induced by both vaccination and infection with antigenically distinct variants. Here, we describe the potency and breadth of neutralizing and binding antibody responses against a large panel of variants following an Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 breakthrough infection in a heterogeneous cohort of individuals with diverse exposure histories. Both BA.1 and BA.2 breakthrough infections significantly boost antibody levels and broaden antibody reactivity. However, this broader immunity induced by BA.1 and BA.2 breakthrough infections does not neutralize Omicron BQ and XBB subvariants efficiently. While these subvariants are not neutralized well by post-breakthrough sera, suggesting escape, binding non-neutralizing antibody responses are sustained. In summary, our data suggest that while BA.1 and BA.2 breakthrough infections broaden the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 spike, the induced neutralizing antibody response is still outpaced by viral evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Many powerful methods have been employed to elucidate the global transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolic responses to pathogen-infected host cells. However, the host glycome responses to bacterial infection remain largely unexplored, and hence, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens manipulate the host glycome to favor infection remains incomplete. Here, we address this gap by performing a systematic analysis of the host glycome during infection by the bacterial pathogen Brucella spp. that cause brucellosis. We discover, surprisingly, that a Brucella effector protein (EP) Rhg1 induces global reprogramming of the host cell N-glycome by interacting with components of the oligosaccharide transferase complex that controls N-linked protein glycosylation, and Rhg1 regulates Brucella replication and tissue colonization in a mouse model of brucellosis, demonstrating that Brucella exploits the EP Rhg1 to reprogram the host N-glycome and promote bacterial intracellular parasitism, thereby providing a paradigm for bacterial control of host cell infection.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration into the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, leading to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells and uncontrolled hyperglycemia. In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) murine model of T1D, the onset of this infiltration starts several weeks before glucose dysregulation and overt diabetes. Recruitment of immune cells to the islets is mediated by several chemotactic cytokines, including CXCL10, while other cytokines, including SDF-1α, can confer protective effects. Global gene expression studies of the pancreas from prediabetic NOD mice and single-cell sequence analysis of human islets from prediabetic, autoantibody-positive patients showed an increased expression of metallothionein (MT), a small molecular weight, cysteine-rich metal-binding stress response protein. We have shown that beta cells can release MT into the extracellular environment, which can subsequently enhance the chemotactic response of Th1 cells to CXCL10 and interfere with the chemotactic response of Th2 cells to SDF-1α. These effects can be blocked in vitro with a monoclonal anti-MT antibody, clone UC1MT. When administered to NOD mice before the onset of diabetes, UC1MT significantly reduces the development of T1D. Manipulation of extracellular MT may be an important approach to preserving beta cell function and preventing the development of T1D.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) cultures are prone to genetic drift, because cells that have acquired specific genetic abnormalities experience a selective advantage in vitro. These abnormalities are highly recurrent in hPSC lines worldwide, but their functional consequences in differentiating cells are scarcely described. In this work, we show that the loss of chromosome 18q impairs neuroectoderm commitment and that downregulation of SALL3, a gene located in the common 18q loss region, is responsible for this failed neuroectodermal differentiation. Knockdown of SALL3 in control lines impaired differentiation in a manner similar to the loss of 18q, and transgenic overexpression of SALL3 in hESCs with 18q loss rescued the differentiation capacity of the cells. Finally, we show that loss of 18q and downregulation of SALL3 leads to changes in the expression of genes involved in pathways regulating pluripotency and differentiation, suggesting that these cells are in an altered state of pluripotency.

Abstract: The role of miR-92a-3p in the ethanol-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role of miR-92a-3p in the ethanol-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes and identified its target genes and signaling pathways. H9c2 cells were cultured with or without 100 mM ethanol for 24 h. The differential expression of miR-92a-3p was verified in H9c2 cells through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). To manipulate the expression of miR-92a-3p, both a mimic and an inhibitor were transfected into H9c2 cells. An Annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide apoptosis detection kit and apoptosis-related antibodies were used for apoptosis detection through flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Target genes were verified through RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and double luciferase reporter gene assays. miR-92a-3p was significantly overexpressed in ethanol-stimulated H9c2 cardiomyocytes (P < 0.001). After ethanol stimulation, H9c2 myocardial cells exhibited increased apoptosis. The apoptosis rate was higher in the miR-92a-3p mimic group than in the control group. However, the apoptosis rate was lower in the miR-92a-3p inhibitor group than in the control group, indicating that miR-92a-3p promotes the ethanol-induced apoptosis of H9c2 myocardial cells. RT-qPCR and Western blotting revealed that the miR-92a-3p mimic and inhibitor significantly regulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 2 and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 2 (CREB3L2), suggesting that miR-92a-3p promotes the apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the MSK2/CREB/Bcl-2 pathway. Therefore, the apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes increases after ethanol stimulation, and miR-92a-3p can directly target MSK2 and CREB3L2, thereby promoting the ethanol-induced apoptosis of H9c2 myocardial cells.

Abstract: Acute liver injury (ALI) refers to the damage to the liver cells of patients due to drugs, food, and diseases. In this work, we used a network pharmacology approach to analyze the relevant targets and pathways of the active ingredients in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) for the treatment of ALI and conducted systematic validation through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The network pharmacologic results predicted that naringenin (NIN) was the main active component of CRP in the treatment of ALI. GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment showed that its mechanism may be related to the regulation of PPARA signaling pathway, PPARG signaling pathway, AKT1 signaling pathway, MAPK3 signaling pathway and other signaling pathways. The results of in vivo experiments showed that (NIN) could reduce the liver lesions, liver adipose lesions, hepatocyte injury and apoptosis in mice with APAP-induced ALI, and reduce the oxidative stress damage of mouse liver cells and the inflammation-related factors to regulate ALI. In vitro experiments showed that NIN could inhibit the proliferation, oxidative stress and inflammation of APAP-induced LO2 cells, promote APAP-induced apoptosis of LO2 cells, and regulate the expression of apoptotic genes in acute liver injury. Further studies showed that NIN inhibited APAP-induced ALI mainly by regulating the PPARA-dependent signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides a preliminary theoretical basis for the screening of active compounds in CRP for the prevention and treatment of ALI.

Abstract: A major obstacle in improving survival in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is understanding how to predict and treat leukemia relapse in the CNS. Leukemia cells are capable of infiltrating and residing within the CNS, primarily the leptomeninges, where they interact with the microenvironment and remain sheltered from systemic treatment. These cells can survive in the CNS, by hijacking the microenvironment and disrupting normal functions, thus promoting malignant transformation. While the protective effects of the bone marrow niche have been widely studied, the mechanisms behind leukemia infiltration into the CNS and the role of the CNS niche in leukemia cell survival remain unknown. We identified a dysregulated gene expression profile in CNS infiltrated T-ALL and CNS relapse, promoting cell survival, chemoresistance, and disease progression. Furthermore, we discovered that interactions between leukemia cells and human meningeal cells induced epigenetic alterations, such as changes in histone modifications, including H3K36me3 levels. These findings are a step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting leukemia cell survival in the CNS microenvironment. Our results highlight genetic and epigenetic alterations induced by interactions between leukemia cells and the CNS niche, which could potentially be utilized as biomarkers to predict CNS infiltration and CNS relapse.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver tumor with a high mortality burden and few treatment options. A promising therapeutic vulnerability in FLC is its driver mutation, a conserved DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion that could be an ideal target neoantigen for immunotherapy. In this study, we aim to define endogenous CD8 T cell responses to this fusion in FLC patients and evaluate fusion-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) for use in cellular immunotherapies. We observe that fusion-specific CD8 T cells are rare and that FLC patient TCR repertoires lack large clusters of related TCR sequences characteristic of potent antigen-specific responses, potentially explaining why endogenous immune responses are insufficient to clear FLC tumors. Nevertheless, we define two functional fusion-specific TCRs, one of which has strong anti-tumor activity in vivo. Together, our results provide insights into the fragmented nature of neoantigen-specific repertoires in humans and indicate routes for clinical development of successful immunotherapies for FLC.

Abstract: Regardless of the clinical response and improved patient survival observed following treatment with BRAFi like Vemurafenib (Vem), rapid development of resistance still remains as a major obstacle in melanoma therapy. In this context, we developed and characterized two acquired Vem-resistant melanoma cell lines, A375V and SK-MEL-28V, and an intrinsically Vem-resistant cell line, RPMI-7951. Altered morphology and growth rate of the resistant cell lines displayed spindle-shaped cells with filopodia formation and enhanced proliferation rate as compared to parental cells. Further in vitro characterization in 2D models confirmed the emergence of a resistant phenotype in melanoma cells. To mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment, spheroids were developed for both parental and resistant cell lines to recognize materialization of invadopodia structures demonstrating elevated invasiveness and proliferation of resistant cells-based spheroids, especially A375V. Importantly, we validated A375V cell line in vivo to prove its tumorigenicity and drug resistance in tumor xenograft model. Taken together, our established clinically relevant Vem-resistant tumor model could be beneficial to elucidate drug resistance mechanisms, screen and identify novel anticancer therapies to overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Key gene mutations are essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) development; however, how the mutated tumor cells impact the surrounding normal cells to promote tumor progression has not been well defined. Here, we report that PIK3CA mutant tumor cells transmit oncogenic signals and result in malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via paracrine exosomal arachidonic acid (AA)-induced H3K4 trimethylation. Mechanistically, PIK3CA mutations sustain SGK3-FBW7-mediated stability of the cPLA2 protein, leading to the synthetic increase in AA, which is transported through exosome and accumulated in IECs. Transferred AA directly binds Menin and strengthens the interactions of Menin and MLL1/2 methyltransferase. Finally, the combination of VTP50469, an inhibitor of the Menin-MLL interaction, and alpelisib synergistically represses PDX tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations. Together, these findings unveil the metabolic link between PIK3CA mutant tumor cells and the IECs, highlighting AA as the potential target for the treatment of patients with CRC harboring PIK3CA mutations.

Abstract: Thyroid hormone receptor β (THRβ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-modulated transcription factors. Upon ligand binding, THRβ sequentially recruits the components of transcriptional machinery to modulate target gene expression. In addition to regulating diverse physiological processes, THRβ plays a crucial role in hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis feedback regulation. Anomalies in THRβ gene/protein structure are associated with onset of diverse disease states. In this study, we investigated disease-inflicting truncated variants of THRβ using in-silico analysis and cell-based assays. We examined the THRβ truncated variants on multiple test parameters, including subcellular localization, ligand-receptor interactions, transcriptional functions, interaction with heterodimeric partner RXR, and receptor-chromatin interactions. Moreover, molecular dynamic simulation approaches predicted that shortened THRβ-LBD due to point mutations contributes proportionally to the loss of structural integrity and receptor stability. Deviant subcellular localization and compromised transcriptional function were apparent with these truncated variants. Present study shows that ‘mitotic bookmarking’ property of some THRβ variants is also affected. The study highlights that structural and conformational attributes of THRβ are necessary for normal receptor functioning, and any deviations may contribute to the underlying cause of the inflicted diseases. We anticipate that insights derived herein may contribute to improved mechanistic understanding to assess disease predisposition.

Abstract: Summary
Lung cancer mortality is exacerbated by late-stage diagnosis. Emerging evidence indicates the potential clinical significance of distinct microbial signatures as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers across various cancers. However, circulating microbiome DNA (cmDNA) profiles are underexplored in lung cancer (LC). Here, whole-genome sequencing is performed on plasma of LC patients and healthy controls (HCs). Differentially enriched microbial species are identified between LC and HC. A diagnostic model is developed, which has a high sensitivity of 87.7% and achieves an AUC of 93.2% in the independent validation dataset. Crucially, this model demonstrates the capability to detect early-stage LC, achieving a sensitivity of 86.5% for stage I and 87.1% for tumors <1 cm. In addition, we construct a cmDNA model for recurrence, which precisely predicts LC recurrence after surgery. Overall, this study highlights the significant alterations of cmDNA profiles in LC, indicating its potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis and recurrence.

Abstract: The 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) chaperones control protein homeostasis in all ATP-containing cellular compartments. J-domain proteins (JDPs) coevolved with Hsp70s to trigger ATP hydrolysis and catalytically upload various substrate polypeptides in need to be structurally modified by the chaperone. Here, we measured the protein disaggregation and refolding activities of the main yeast cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1, in the presence of its most abundant JDPs, Sis1 and Ydj1, and two swap mutants, in which the J-domains have been interchanged. The observed differences by which the four constructs differently cooperate with Ssa1 and cooperate with each other, as well as their observed intrinsic ability to bind misfolded substrates and trigger Ssa1′s ATPase, indicate the presence of yet uncharacterized intramolecular dynamic interactions between the J-domains and the remaining C-terminal segments of these proteins. Taken together, the data suggest an autoregulatory role to these intramolecular interactions within both type A and B JDPs, which might have evolved to reduce energy-costly ATPase cycles by the Ssa1–4 chaperones that are the most abundant Hsp70s in the yeast cytosol.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic changes in the epigenome at defined genomic loci play crucial roles during cellular differentiation and disease development. Here, we developed dual-color bimolecular anchor detector (BiAD) sensors for high-sensitivity readout of locus-specific epigenome modifications by fluorescence microscopy. Our BiAD sensors comprise an sgRNA/dCas9 complex as anchor and double chromatin reader domains as detector modules, both fused to complementary parts of a split IFP2.0 fluorophore, enabling its reconstitution upon binding of both parts in close proximity. In addition, a YPet fluorophore is recruited to the sgRNA to mark the genomic locus of interest. With these dual-color BiAD sensors, we detected H3K9me2/3 and DNA methylation and their dynamic changes upon RNAi or inhibitor treatment with high sensitivity at endogenous genomic regions. Furthermore, we showcased locus-specific H3K36me2/3 readout as well as H3K27me3 and H3K9me2/3 enrichment on the inactive X chromosome, highlighting the broad applicability of our dual-color BiAD sensors for single-cell epigenome studies.

Abstract: Summary
Despite most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients entering remission following chemotherapy, outcomes remain poor due to surviving leukemic cells that contribute to relapse. The nature of these enduring cells is poorly understood. Here, through temporal single-cell transcriptomic characterization of AML hierarchical regeneration in response to chemotherapy, we reveal a cell population: AML regeneration enriched cells (RECs). RECs are defined by CD74/CD68 expression, and although derived from leukemic stem cells (LSCs), are devoid of stem/progenitor capacity. Based on REC in situ proximity to CD34-expressing cells identified using spatial transcriptomics on AML patient bone marrow samples, RECs demonstrate the ability to augment or reduce leukemic regeneration in vivo based on transfusion or depletion, respectively. Furthermore, RECs are prognostic for patient survival as well as predictive of treatment failure in AML cohorts. Our study reveals RECs as a previously unknown functional catalyst of LSC-driven regeneration contributing to the non-canonical framework of AML regeneration.
