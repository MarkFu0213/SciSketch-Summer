Abstract: Summary
A missense change in RRAS2 (Gln72 to Leu), analogous to the Gln61-to-Leu mutation of RAS oncoproteins, has been identified as a long-tail hotspot mutation in cancer and Noonan syndrome. However, the relevance of this mutation for in vivo tumorigenesis remains understudied. Here we show, using an inducible knockin mouse model, that R-Ras2Q72L triggers rapid development of a wide spectrum of tumors when somatically expressed in adult tissues. These tumors show limited overlap with those originated by classical Ras oncogenes. R-Ras2Q72L-driven tumors can be classified into different subtypes according to therapeutic susceptibility. Importantly, the most relevant R-Ras2Q72L-driven tumors are dependent on mTORC1 but independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, MEK-, and Ral guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation stimulator. This pharmacological vulnerability is due to the extensive rewiring by R-Ras2Q72L of pathways that orthogonally stimulate mTORC1 signaling. These findings demonstrate that RRAS2Q72L is a bona fide oncogenic driver and unveil therapeutic strategies for patients with cancer and Noonan syndrome bearing RRAS2 mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Upon fertilization, embryos undergo chromatin reprogramming and genome activation; however, the mechanisms that regulate these processes are poorly understood. Here, we generated a triple mutant for Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b (NPS) in zebrafish and found that NPS pioneer chromatin opening at >50% of active enhancers. NPS regulate acetylation across core histones at enhancers and promoters, and their function in gene activation can be bypassed by recruiting histone acetyltransferase to individual genes. NPS pioneer chromatin opening individually, redundantly, or additively depending on sequence context, and we show that high nucleosome occupancy facilitates NPS pioneering activity. Nucleosome position varies based on the input of different transcription factors (TFs), providing a flexible platform to modulate pioneering activity. Altogether, our results illuminate the sequence of events during genome activation and offer a conceptual framework to understand how pioneer factors interpret the genome and integrate different TF inputs across cell types and developmental transitions.

Abstract: Summary
The pro-inflammatory activation of microglia is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this process involves a switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward glycolysis. Here, we show how a positive feedback loop in microglia drives AD pathogenesis, and we demonstrate that inhibiting this cycle in microglia can ameliorate Aβ burden and cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model (5XFAD). After first detecting elevated histone lactylation in brain samples from both 5XFAD mice and individuals with AD, we observed that H4K12la levels are elevated in Aβ plaque-adjacent microglia. This lactate-dependent histone modification is enriched at the promoters of glycolytic genes and activates transcription, thereby increasing glycolytic activity. Ultimately, the glycolysis/H4K12la/PKM2 positive feedback loop exacerbates microglial dysfunction in AD. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 attenuated microglial activation, and microglia-specific ablation of Pkm2 improved spatial learning and memory in AD mice. Thus, our study illustrates that disruption of the positive feedback loop may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.

Abstract: Summary
Prokaryotic organisms have developed multiple defense systems against phages; however, little is known about whether and how these interact with each other. Here, we studied the connection between two of the most prominent prokaryotic immune systems: restriction-modification and CRISPR. While both systems employ enzymes that cleave a specific DNA sequence of the invader, CRISPR nucleases are programmed with phage-derived spacer sequences, which are integrated into the CRISPR locus upon infection. We found that restriction endonucleases provide a short-term defense, which is rapidly overcome through methylation of the phage genome. In a small fraction of the cells, however, restriction results in the acquisition of spacer sequences from the cleavage site, which mediates a robust type II-A CRISPR-Cas immune response against the methylated phage. This mechanism is reminiscent of eukaryotic immunity in which the innate response offers a first temporary line of defense and also activates a second and more robust adaptive response.

Abstract: Summary
Rhinovirus (RV) infection of the bronchial epithelium is implicated in the vast majority of severe asthma exacerbations. Interestingly, the susceptibility of bronchial epithelium to RV infection is increased in persons with asthma. Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) remodeling is an important feature of severe asthma pathophysiology, and its reduction using bronchial thermoplasty has been associated with a significant decrease in the exacerbation rate. We hypothesized that asthmatic BSM can play a role in RV infection of the bronchial epithelium. Using an original co-culture model between bronchial epithelium and BSM cells, we show that asthmatic BSM cells increase RV replication in bronchial epithelium following RV infection. These findings are related to the increased production of CCL20 by asthmatic BSM cells. Moreover, we demonstrate an original downregulation of the activity of the epithelial protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) antiviral pathway. Finally, we identify a direct bottom-up effect of asthmatic BSM cells on bronchial epithelium susceptibility to RV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Branching morphogenesis is a fundamental process by which organs in invertebrates and vertebrates form branches to expand their surface areas. The current dogma holds that directional cell migration determines where a new branch forms and thus patterns branching. Here, we asked whether mouse Lgl1, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Lgl, regulates epithelial polarity in the mammary gland. Surprisingly, mammary glands lacking Lgl1 have normal epithelial polarity, but they form fewer branches. Moreover, we find that Lgl1 null epithelium is unable to directionally migrate, suggesting that migration is not essential for mammary epithelial branching as expected. We show that LGL1 binds to Integrin β1 and inhibits its downstream signaling, and Integrin β1 overexpression blocks epithelial migration, thus recapitulating the Lgl1 null phenotype. Altogether, we demonstrate that Lgl1 modulation of Integrin β1 signaling is essential for directional migration and that epithelial branching in invertebrates and the mammary gland is fundamentally distinct.

Abstract: Summary
IDO1 oxidizes tryptophan (TRP) to generate kynurenine (KYN), the substrate for 1-carbon and NAD metabolism, and is implicated in pro-cancer pathophysiology and infection biology. However, the mechanistic relationships between IDO1 in amino acid depletion versus product generation have remained a longstanding mystery. We found an unrecognized link between IDO1 and cell survival mediated by KYN that serves as the source for molecules that inhibit ferroptotic cell death. We show that this effect requires KYN export from IDO1-expressing cells, which is then available for non-IDO1-expressing cells via SLC7A11, the central transporter involved in ferroptosis suppression. Whether inside the “producer” IDO1+ cell or the “receiver” cell, KYN is converted into downstream metabolites, suppressing ferroptosis by ROS scavenging and activating an NRF2-dependent, AHR-independent cell-protective pathway, including SLC7A11, propagating anti-ferroptotic signaling. IDO1, therefore, controls a multi-pronged protection pathway from ferroptotic cell death, underscoring the need to re-evaluate the use of IDO1 inhibitors in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The HNF1αp291fsinsC truncation is the most common mutation associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3). Although shown to impair HNF1α signaling, the mechanism by which HNF1αp291fsinsC causes MODY3 is not fully understood. Here we use MODY3 patient and CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) grown as 3D organoids to investigate how HNF1αp291fsinsC affects hiPSC differentiation during pancreatic development. HNF1αp291fsinsC hiPSCs shows reduced pancreatic progenitor and β cell differentiation. Mechanistically, HNF1αp291fsinsC interacts with HNF1β and inhibits its function, and disrupting this interaction partially rescues HNF1β-dependent transcription. HNF1β overexpression in the HNF1αp291fsinsC patient organoid line increases PDX1+ progenitors, while HNF1β overexpression in the HNF1αp291fsinsC patient iPSC line partially rescues β cell differentiation. Our study highlights the capability of pancreas progenitor-derived organoids to model disease in vitro. Additionally, it uncovers an HNF1β-mediated mechanism linked to HNF1α truncation that affects progenitor differentiation and could explain the clinical heterogeneity observed in MODY3 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Monosodium urate crystals (MSUc) induce inflammation in vivo without prior priming, raising the possibility of an initial cell-autonomous phase. Here, using genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MSUc alone induce a metabolic-inflammatory transcriptional program in non-primed human and murine macrophages that is markedly distinct to that induced by LPS. Genes uniquely upregulated in response to MSUc belong to lipid and amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, and SLC transporters. This upregulation leads to a metabolic rewiring in sera from individuals and mice with acute gouty arthritis. Mechanistically, the initiating inflammatory-metabolic changes in acute gout flares are regulated through a persistent expression and increased binding of JUN to the promoter of target genes through JNK signaling—but not P38—in a process that is different than after LPS stimulation and independent of inflammasome activation. Finally, pharmacological JNK inhibition limits MSUc-induced inflammation in animal models of acute gouty inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The composition and origin of extrinsic cues required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance are incompletely understood. Here we identify renal Klotho and inorganic phosphate (Pi) as extrinsic factors that antagonistically regulate HSC maintenance in the bone marrow (BM). Disruption of the Klotho-Pi axis by renal Klotho deficiency or Pi excess causes Pi overload in the BM niche and Pi retention in HSCs, leading to alteration of HSC maintenance. Mechanistically, Pi retention is mediated by soluble carrier family 20 member 1 (SLC20A1) and sensed by diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 2 (PPIP5K2) to enhance Akt activation, which then upregulates SLC20A1 to aggravate Pi retention and augments GATA2 activity to drive the expansion and megakaryocyte/myeloid-biased differentiation of HSCs. However, kidney-secreted soluble Klotho directly maintains HSC pool size and differentiation by restraining SLC20A1-mediated Pi absorption of HSCs. These findings uncover a regulatory role of the Klotho-Pi axis orchestrated by the kidneys in BM HSC maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Bioinformatic analysis of 94 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), cell lines, and organoids (PCOs) identifies three intrinsic transcriptional subtypes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: androgen receptor (AR) pathway + prostate cancer (PC) (ARPC), mesenchymal and stem-like PC (MSPC), and neuroendocrine PC (NEPC). A sizable proportion of castration-resistant and metastatic stage PC (M-CRPC) cases are admixtures of ARPC and MSPC. Analysis of clinical datasets and mechanistic studies indicates that MSPC arises from ARPC as a consequence of therapy-induced lineage plasticity. AR blockade with enzalutamide induces (1) transcriptional silencing of TP53 and hence dedifferentiation to a hybrid epithelial and mesenchymal and stem-like state and (2) inhibition of BMP signaling, which promotes resistance to AR inhibition. Enzalutamide-tolerant LNCaP cells re-enter the cell cycle in response to neuregulin and generate metastasis in mice. Combined inhibition of HER2/3 and AR or mTORC1 exhibits efficacy in models of ARPC and MSPC or MSPC, respectively. These results define MSPC, trace its origin to therapy-induced lineage plasticity, and reveal its sensitivity to HER2/3 inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Although increased neuropeptides are often detected in lungs that exhibit respiratory distress, whether they contribute to the condition is unknown. Here, we show in a mouse model of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, a pediatric disease with increased pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), excess PNEC-derived neuropeptides are responsible for pulmonary manifestations including hypoxemia. In mouse postnatal lung, prolonged signaling from elevated neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activate receptors enriched on endothelial cells, leading to reduced cellular junction gene expression, increased endothelium permeability, excess lung fluid, and hypoxemia. Excess fluid and hypoxemia were effectively attenuated by either prevention of PNEC formation, inactivation of CGRP gene, endothelium-specific inactivation of CGRP receptor gene, or treatment with CGRP receptor antagonist. Neuropeptides were increased in human lung diseases with excess fluid such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our findings suggest that restricting neuropeptide function may limit fluid and improve gas exchange in these conditions.

Abstract: Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacterial pathogens are commonly found in Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), particularly infected in females like pregnant women, elder people, sexually active, or individuals prone to other risk factors for UTI. In this article, we review the expression of virulence surface proteins and their interaction with host cells for the most frequently isolated uropathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. In addition to the host cell interaction, surface protein regulation was also discussed in this article. The surface protein regulation serves as a key tool in differentiating the pathogen isotypes. Furthermore, it might provide insights on novel diagnostic methods to detect uropathogen that are otherwise easily overlooked due to limited culture-based assays. In essence, this review shall provide an in-depth understanding on secretion of virulence factors of various uropathogens and their role in host-pathogen interaction, this knowledge might be useful in the development of therapeutics against uropathogens.

Abstract: Summary
In human cells, ATR/Chk1 signaling couples S phase exit with the expression of mitotic inducers and prevents premature mitosis upon replication stress (RS). Nonetheless, under-replicated DNA can persist at mitosis, prompting chromosomal instability. To decipher how the DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) allows cells to enter mitosis over time upon RS, we developed a FRET-based Chk1 activity sensor. During unperturbed growth, a basal Chk1 activity level is sustained throughout S phase and relies on replication origin firing. Incremental RS triggers stepwise Chk1 over-activation that delays S-phase, suggesting a rheostat-like role for DRC coupled with the replication machinery. Upon RS, Chk1 is inactivated as DNA replication terminates but surprisingly is reactivated in a subset of G2 cells, which relies on Cdk1/2 and Plk1 and prevents mitotic entry. Cells can override active Chk1 signaling and reach mitosis onset, revealing checkpoint adaptation. Cell division following Chk1 reactivation in G2 results in a p53/p21-dependent G1 arrest, eliminating the daughter cells from proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The Krebs cycle-derived metabolite itaconate and its derivatives suppress the inflammatory response in pro-inflammatory “M1” macrophages. However, alternatively activated “M2” macrophages can take up itaconate. We therefore examined the effect of itaconate and 4-octyl itaconate (OI) on M2 macrophage activation. We demonstrate that itaconate and OI inhibit M2 polarization and metabolic remodeling. Examination of IL-4 signaling revealed inhibition of JAK1 and STAT6 phosphorylation by both itaconate and OI. JAK1 activation was also inhibited by OI in response to IL-13, interferon-β, and interferon-γ in macrophages and in T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Importantly, JAK1 was directly modified by itaconate derivatives at multiple residues, including cysteines 715, 816, 943, and 1130. Itaconate and OI also inhibited JAK1 kinase activity. Finally, OI treatment suppressed M2 macrophage polarization and JAK1 phosphorylation in vivo. We therefore identify itaconate and OI as JAK1 inhibitors, suggesting a new strategy to inhibit JAK1 in M2 macrophage-driven diseases.

Abstract: Interactive mechanical forces between pairs of individual SNARE proteins synaptobrevin 2 (Sb2) and syntaxin 1A (Sx1A) may be sufficient to mediate vesicle docking. This notion, based on force spectroscopy single molecule measurements probing recombinant Sx1A an Sb2 in silico, questioned a predominant view of docking via the ternary SNARE complex formation, which includes an assembly of the intermediate cis binary complex between Sx1A and SNAP25 on the plasma membrane to engage Sb2 on the vesicle. However, whether a trans binary Sx1A-Sb2 complex alone could mediate vesicle docking in a cellular environment remains unclear. To address this issue, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the force spectroscopy mode combined with fluorescence imaging. Using AFM tips functionalized with the full Sx1A cytosolic domain, we probed native Sb2 studding the membrane of secretory vesicles docked at the plasma membrane patches, referred to as “inside-out lawns”, identified based on fluorescence stains and prepared from primary culture of lactotrophs. We recorded single molecule Sx1A-Sb2 mechanical interactions and obtained measurements of force (∼183 pN) and extension (∼21.6 nm) necessary to take apart Sx1A-Sb2 binding interactions formed at tip-vesicle contact. Measured interactive force between a single pair of Sx1A-Sb2 molecules is sufficient to hold a single secretory vesicle docked at the plasma membrane within distances up to that of the measured extension. This finding further advances a notion that native vesicle docking can be mediated by a single trans binary Sx1A-Sb2 complex in the absence of SNAP25.

Abstract: Summary
miR-10b is silenced in normal neuroglial cells of the brain but commonly activated in glioma, where it assumes an essential tumor-promoting role. We demonstrate that the entire miR-10b-hosting HOXD locus is activated in glioma via the cis-acting mechanism involving 3D chromatin reorganization and CTCF-cohesin-mediated looping. This mechanism requires two interacting lncRNAs, HOXD-AS2 and LINC01116, one associated with HOXD3/HOXD4/miR-10b promoter and another with the remote enhancer. Knockdown of either lncRNA in glioma cells alters CTCF and cohesin binding, abolishes chromatin looping, inhibits the expression of all genes within HOXD locus, and leads to glioma cell death. Conversely, in cortical astrocytes, enhancer activation is sufficient for HOXD/miR-10b locus reorganization, gene derepression, and neoplastic cell transformation. LINC01116 RNA is essential for this process. Our results demonstrate the interplay of two lncRNAs in the chromatin folding and concordant regulation of miR-10b and multiple HOXD genes normally silenced in astrocytes and triggering the neoplastic glial transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Establishing germ cell sexual identity is critical for development of male and female germline stem cells (GSCs) and production of sperm or eggs. Germ cells depend on signals from the somatic gonad to determine sex, but in organisms such as flies, mice, and humans, the sex chromosome genotype of the germ cells is also important for germline sexual development. How somatic signals and germ-cell-intrinsic cues combine to regulate germline sex determination is thus a key question. We find that JAK/STAT signaling in the GSC niche promotes male identity in germ cells, in part by activating the chromatin reader Phf7. Further, we find that JAK/STAT signaling is blocked in XX (female) germ cells through the action of the sex determination gene Sex lethal to preserve female identity. Thus, an important function of germline sexual identity is to control how GSCs respond to signals in their niche environment.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbes play important roles in host physiology; however, the mechanisms underlying their impact remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that microbes not only influence gut physiology but also alter its epithelial composition. The microbiota and pathogens both influence intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation. Intriguingly, while the microbiota promotes ISC differentiation into enterocytes (EC), pathogens stimulate enteroendocrine cell (EE) fate and long-term accumulation of EEs in the midgut epithelium. Importantly, the evolutionarily conserved Drosophila NFKB (Relish) pushes stem cell lineage specification toward ECs by directly regulating differentiation factors. Conversely, the JAK-STAT pathway promotes EE fate in response to infectious damage. We propose a model in which the balance of microbial pattern recognition pathways, such as Imd-Relish, and damage response pathways, such as JAK-STAT, influence ISC differentiation, epithelial composition, and gut physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis changes over life to meet the demands of maturation and aging. Here, we find that the definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment is remodeled from gestation into adulthood, a process regulated by the heterochronic Lin28b/let-7 axis. Native fetal and neonatal HSPCs distribute with a pro-lymphoid/erythroid bias with a shift toward myeloid output in adulthood. By mining transcriptomic data comparing juvenile and adult HSPCs and reconstructing coordinately activated gene regulatory networks, we uncover the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) component Cbx2 as an effector of Lin28b/let-7’s control of hematopoietic maturation. We find that juvenile Cbx2−/− hematopoietic tissues show impairment of B-lymphopoiesis, a precocious adult-like myeloid bias, and that Cbx2/PRC1 regulates developmental timing of expression of key hematopoietic transcription factors. These findings define a mechanism of regulation of HSPC output via chromatin modification as a function of age with potential impact on age-biased pediatric and adult blood disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The subthalamic nucleus (STN) controls psychomotor activity and is an efficient therapeutic deep brain stimulation target in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Despite evidence indicating position-dependent therapeutic effects and distinct functions within the STN, the input circuit and cellular profile in the STN remain largely unclear. Using neuroanatomical techniques, we construct a comprehensive connectivity map of the indirect and hyperdirect pathways in the mouse STN. Our circuit- and cellular-level connectivities reveal a topographically graded organization with three types of indirect and hyperdirect pathways (external globus pallidus only, STN only, and collateral). We confirm consistent pathways into the human STN by 7 T MRI-based tractography. We identify two functional types of topographically distinct glutamatergic STN neurons (parvalbumin [PV+/−]) with synaptic connectivity from indirect and hyperdirect pathways. Glutamatergic PV+ STN neurons contribute to burst firing. These data suggest a complex interplay of information integration within the basal ganglia underlying coordinated movement control and therapeutic effects.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a widely prevalent chronic disease and risk factor for several other diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Apoptosis is a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cell numbers at a certain level in tissues. Chronic high blood glucose levels might lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and trigger undesirable apoptosis in T2DM. The pineal hormone melatonin has been shown to regulate apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the melatonin MT2 receptor in the role of melatonin to prevent undesirable apotosis in different tissues of diabetic rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups; 1. Control group (only vehicle), 2. Diabetic group (streptozotozin/nicotinamide treated), 3. Diabetic group treated with melatonin (500μg/kg/day), and 4. Diabetic group treated with melatonin (500 μg/kg/day for 6 weeks) and the selective MT2 receptor antagonist luzindole (0.25 g/kg/day for 6 weeks). Various tissue samples (kidney, liver, adipose tissue, pancreas) were removed after 6 weeks for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated an increased rate of apoptosis in different tissues of diabetic rats compared to controls with melatonin reducing the apoptotic rate in the tissues of rats with T2DM. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effects of melatonin were partly mediated by the melatonin MT2 receptor.

Abstract: Objective
Pancreatic cancer (PC) has the worst prognosis of all common cancers worldwide. This study was intended to investigate the role of ubiquitin specific peptidase 22 (USP22) in cisplatin sensitivity of PC cells and its regulatory mechanism.
Methods
The expression of USP22 and the toxicity of cisplatin to PC cells were detected. The two cell lines AsPC-1 and CAPAN-1 with the most differential drug resistance were selected. By down-expressing USP22 in CAPAN-1 cells and over-expressing USP22 in AsPC-1 cells, the survival rate of PC cells treated with cisplatin was detected. The mRNA expressions of stem cell markers, cell stemness, migration ability and apoptosis of PC cells were detected. The expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway related proteins was detected. The role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PC cell stemness and cisplatin sensitivity was explored after adding the inhibitor HLY78 and activator DKK1.
Results
USP22 was highly-expressed in PC cells, and the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin was negatively-correlated with USP22 expression. Downregulation of USP22 raised the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin, reduced the levels of stem cell markers, reduced the tumor sphere formation and migration, and promoted apoptosis. Silencing USP22 inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Inhibition of USP22 reduced the cell stemness and augmented the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Conclusion
Silencing USP22 can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to reduce cell stemness and enhance the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
A key question in current immunology is how the innate immune system generates high levels of specificity. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, we demonstrate that functional loss of NMUR-1, a neuronal G-protein-coupled receptor homologous to mammalian receptors for the neuropeptide neuromedin U, has diverse effects on C. elegans innate immunity against various bacterial pathogens. Transcriptomic analyses and functional assays reveal that NMUR-1 modulates C. elegans transcription activity by regulating the expression of transcription factors involved in binding to RNA polymerase II regulatory regions, which, in turn, controls the expression of distinct immune genes in response to different pathogens. These results uncover a molecular basis for the specificity of C. elegans innate immunity. Given the evolutionary conservation of NMUR-1 signaling in immune regulation across multicellular organisms, our study could provide mechanistic insights into understanding the specificity of innate immunity in other animals, including mammals.

Abstract: Summary
A compact protein with a size of <1,000 amino acids, the CRISPR-associated protein CasX is a fundamentally distinct RNA-guided nuclease when compared to Cas9 and Cas12a. Although it can induce RNA-guided genome editing in mammalian cells, the activity of CasX is less robust than that of the widely used S. pyogenes Cas9. Here, we show that structural features of two CasX homologs and their guide RNAs affect the R-loop complex assembly and DNA cleavage activity. Cryo-EM-based structural engineering of either the CasX protein or the guide RNA produced two new CasX genome editors (DpbCasX-R3-v2 and PlmCasX-R1-v2) with significantly improved DNA manipulation efficacy. These results advance both the mechanistic understanding of CasX and its application as a genome-editing tool.

Abstract: Ca2+ signalling is of prime importance in controlling numerous cell functions in the brain. Endolysosomes are acidic organelles currently emerging as important Ca2+ stores in astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and neurons. In neurons, these acidic Ca2+ stores are found in axons, soma, dendrites, and axon endings and could provide local sources of Ca2+ to control synaptic transmission, neuronal plasticity, and autophagy to name a few. This review will address how acidic Ca2+ stores are recruited in response to cell stimulation. We will focus on the role of the endolysosomal two-pore channels (TPCs) and their physiological agonist nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and how they interact with cyclic ADP-ribose and ryanodine receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, this review will describe new pharmacological tools and animal mutant models now available to explore acidic Ca2+ stores as key elements in brain function and dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
B-1 cell development mainly occurs via fetal and neonatal hematopoiesis and is suppressed in adult bone marrow hematopoiesis. However, little is known about the factors inhibiting B-1 cell development at the adult stage. We report that capicua (CIC) suppresses postnatal B-1a cell development and survival. CIC levels are high in B-1a cells and gradually increase in transitional B-1a (TrB-1a) cells with age. B-cell-specific Cic-null mice exhibit expansion of the B-1a cell population and a gradual increase in TrB-1a cell frequency with age but attenuated B-2 cell development. CIC deficiency enhances B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in transitional B cells and B-1a cell viability. Mechanistically, CIC-deficiency-mediated Per2 derepression upregulates Bhlhe41 levels by inhibiting CRY-mediated transcriptional repression for Bhlhe41, consequently promoting B-1a cell formation in Cic-null mice. Taken together, CIC is a key transcription factor that limits the B-1a cell population at the adult stage and balances B-1 versus B-2 cell formation.

Abstract: Summary
7SK is a conserved noncoding RNA that regulates transcription by sequestering the transcription factor P-TEFb. 7SK function entails complex changes in RNA structure, but characterizing RNA dynamics in cells remains an unsolved challenge. We developed a single-molecule chemical probing strategy, DANCE-MaP (deconvolution and annotation of ribonucleic conformational ensembles), that defines per-nucleotide reactivity, direct base pairing interactions, tertiary interactions, and thermodynamic populations for each state in RNA structural ensembles from a single experiment. DANCE-MaP reveals that 7SK RNA encodes a large-scale structural switch that couples dissolution of the P-TEFb binding site to structural remodeling at distal release factor binding sites. The 7SK structural equilibrium shifts in response to cell growth and stress and can be targeted to modulate expression of P-TEFbresponsive genes. Our study reveals that RNA structural dynamics underlie 7SK function as an integrator of diverse cellular signals to control transcription and establishes the power of DANCE-MaP to define RNA dynamics in cells.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 clade C envelope immunogens that elicit both neutralizing and non-neutralizing V1V2-scaffold-specific antibodies (protective correlates from RV144 human trial) are urgently needed due to the prevalence of this clade in the most impacted regions worldwide. To achieve this, we introduce structure-guided changes followed by consensus-C-sequence-guided optimizations at the V2 region to generate UFO-v2-RQH173 trimer. This improves the abundance of well-formed trimers. Following the immunization of rabbits, the wild-type protein fails to elicit any autologous neutralizing antibodies, but UFO-v2-RQH173 elicits both autologous neutralizing and broad V1V2-scaffold antibodies. The variant with a 173Y modification in the V2 region, most prevalent among HIV-1 sequences, shows decreased ability in displaying a native-like V1V2 epitope with time in vitro and elicited antibodies with lower neutralizing and higher V1V2-scaffold activities. Our results identify a stabilized clade C trimer capable of eliciting improved neutralizing and V1V2-scaffold antibodies and reveal the importance of the V2 region in tuning this.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic osteodystrophy (HOD) is a metabolic bone disease that is often associated with chronic liver disease and is marked by bone loss. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic expression of the phosphatase PP2Acα is upregulated during HOD, leading to the downregulation of expression of the hepatokine lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Loss of LCAT function markedly exacerbates the bone loss phenotype of HOD in mice. In addition, we found that alterations in cholesterol levels are involved in the regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast activities. We also found that LCAT improves liver function and relieves liver fibrosis in the mouse HOD model by promoting reversal of cholesterol transport from the bone to the liver. In summary, defects in a liver-bone axis occur during HOD that can be targeted to ameliorate disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
The latency of spikes relative to a stimulus conveys sensory information across modalities. However, in most cases, it remains unclear whether and how such latency codes are utilized by postsynaptic neurons. In the active electrosensory system of mormyrid fish, a latency code for stimulus amplitude in electroreceptor afferent nerve fibers (EAs) is hypothesized to be read out by a central reference provided by motor corollary discharge (CD). Here, we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population give rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs. Inhibitory control over the temporal window of integration renders two granular cell subclasses differentially sensitive to information derived from relative spike latency versus spike count.

Abstract: Summary
HOTTIP lncRNA is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by MLL rearrangements or NPM1 mutations to mediate HOXA topologically associated domain (TAD) formation and drive aberrant transcription. However, the mechanism through which HOTTIP accesses CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) chromatin boundaries and regulates CTCF-mediated genome topology remains unknown. Here, we show that HOTTIP directly interacts with and regulates a fraction of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) in the AML genome by recruiting CTCF/cohesin complex and R-loop-associated regulators to form R-loops. HOTTIP-mediated R-loops reinforce the CTCF boundary and facilitate formation of TADs to drive gene transcription. Either deleting CBS or targeting RNase H to eliminate R-loops in the boundary CBS of β-catenin TAD impaired CTCF boundary activity, inhibited promoter/enhancer interactions, reduced β-catenin target expression, and mitigated leukemogenesis in xenograft mouse models with aberrant HOTTIP expression. Thus, HOTTIP-mediated R-loop formation directly reinforces CTCF chromatin boundary activity and TAD integrity to drive oncogene transcription and leukemia development.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are crucial cell populations involved in tumor immune escape, and their functions are regulated by multiple epigenetic mechanisms. The precise regulation mode of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in controlling TIM function is still poorly understood. Our study revealed that the increased expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in TIMs was correlated with the poor prognosis of colon cancer patients, and myeloid deficiency of METTL3 attenuated tumor growth in mice. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on Jak1 mRNA in TIMs, the m6A-YTHDF1 axis enhanced JAK1 protein translation efficiency and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3. Lactate accumulated in tumor microenvironment potently induced METTL3 upregulation in TIMs via H3K18 lactylation. Interestingly, we identified two lactylation modification sites in the zinc-finger domain of METTL3, which was essential for METTL3 to capture target RNA. Our results emphasize the importance of lactylation-driven METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification for promoting the immunosuppressive capacity of TIMs.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical decisions in cancer rely on precisely assessing patient risk. To improve our ability to identify the most aggressive malignancies, we constructed genome-wide survival models using gene expression, copy number, methylation, and mutation data from 10,884 patients. We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
We report a comprehensive proteomic study of a 90-case cohort of paired samples of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in quantification, phosphorylation, and DNA-binding capacity. Four integrative subtypes (iP-1–4) are stratified on the basis of global proteome and phosphoproteome, each of which exhibits distinct molecular and pathway features. Scaffold and co-expression network analyses of three proteomic datasets, integrated with those from genome and transcriptome of the same cohort, reveal key pathways and master regulators that, characteristic of TNBC subtypes, play important regulatory roles within and between scaffold sub-structures and co-expression communities. We find that NAE1 is a potential drug target for subtype iP-1, and a series of key molecules in fatty acid metabolism, such as AKT1/FASN, are plausible targets for subtype iP-2. Libraries of proteins, pathways and networks of TNBC provide a valuable molecular infrastructure for further clinical exploration and in-depth studies of the molecular mechanisms of the disease.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the role of connexin 43 (CX43) in thoracic ossification of ligamentum flavum (TOLF) based on the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)-runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) pathway. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CX43 expression in TOLF and non-TOLF patients, fibroblasts of TOLF were isolated and induced osteogenic differentiation, and CX43 expression was detected by western blot analysis (WB). In addition, si-CX43 was used to intervene CX43, and SB203580 was used to inhibit the p38MAPK. The expressions of bone differentiation marker protein were detected by WB, and the ossification ability was analyzed by alizarin red staining. The interaction between RUNX2 and CX43 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results found that CX43 was highly expressed during TOLF, and si-CX43 could inhibit the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteopontin (OPN), as well as inhibit TOLF and the p38MAPK-RUNX2 pathway. In addition, SB203580 showed a synergistic effect with si-CX43 to further inhibit TOLF and the expression of RUNX2. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that RUNX2 could bind to the CX43 promoter. In conclusion, CX43 promotes TOLF, which may be mediated by p38MAPK-RUNX2, and RUNX2 binds to the CX43 promoter to form a positive feedback regulatory loop during TOLF.

Abstract: Summary
The striatum mediates two learning modalities: goal-directed behavior in dorsomedial (DMS) and habits in dorsolateral (DLS) striata. The synaptic bases of these learnings are still elusive. Indeed, while ample research has described DLS plasticity, little remains known about DMS plasticity and its involvement in procedural learning. Here, we find symmetric and asymmetric anti-Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in DMS and DLS, respectively, with opposite plasticity dominance upon increasing corticostriatal activity. During motor-skill learning, plasticity is engaged in DMS and striatonigral DLS neurons only during early learning stages, whereas striatopallidal DLS neurons are mobilized only during late phases. With a mathematical modeling approach, we find that symmetric anti-Hebbian STDP favors memory flexibility, while asymmetric anti-Hebbian STDP favors memory maintenance, consistent with memory processes at play in procedural learning.

Abstract: Summary
During the translation surveillance mechanism known as ribosome-associated quality control, the ASC-1 complex (ASCC) disassembles ribosomes stalled on the mRNA. Here, we show that there are two distinct classes of stalled ribosome. Ribosomes stalled by translation elongation inhibitors or methylated mRNA are short lived in human cells because they are split by the ASCC. In contrast, although ultraviolet light and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide induce ribosome stalling by damaging mRNA, and the ASCC is recruited to these stalled ribosomes, we found that they are refractory to the ASCC. Consequently, unresolved UV- and 4NQO-stalled ribosomes persist in human cells. We show that ribosome stalling activates cell-cycle arrest, partly through ZAK-p38MAPK signaling, and that this cell-cycle delay is prolonged when the ASCC cannot resolve stalled ribosomes. Thus, we propose that the sensitivity of stalled ribosomes to the ASCC influences the kinetics of stall resolution, which in turn controls the adaptive stress response.

Abstract: Summary
Neuron-glia interactions play a critical role in the regulation of synapse formation and circuit assembly. Here we demonstrate that canonical Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway signaling in cortical astrocytes acts to coordinate layer-specific synaptic connectivity. We show that the Shh receptor Ptch1 is expressed by cortical astrocytes during development and that Shh signaling is necessary and sufficient to promote the expression of genes involved in regulating synaptic development and layer-enriched astrocyte molecular identity. Loss of Shh in layer V neurons reduces astrocyte complexity and coverage by astrocytic processes in tripartite synapses; conversely, cell-autonomous activation of Shh signaling in astrocytes promotes cortical excitatory synapse formation. Furthermore, Shh-dependent genes Lrig1 and Sparc distinctively contribute to astrocyte morphology and synapse formation. Together, these results suggest that Shh secreted from deep-layer cortical neurons acts to specialize the molecular and functional features of astrocytes during development to shape circuit assembly and function.

Abstract: Summary
RAR-related orphan receptor-γ (RORγt) is an essential transcription factor for thymic T cell development, secondary lymphoid tissue organogenesis, and peripheral immune cell differentiation. Serine 182 phosphorylation is a major post-translational modification (PTM) on RORγt. However, the in vivo contribution of this PTM in health and disease settings is unclear. We report that this PTM is not involved in thymic T cell development and effector T cell differentiation. Instead, it is a critical regulator of inflammation downstream of IL-1β signaling and extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) activation. ERKs phosphorylation of serine 182 on RORγt serves to simultaneously restrict Th17 hyperactivation and promote anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production in RORγt+ Treg cells. Phospho-null RORγtS182A knockin mice experience exacerbated inflammation in models of colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In summary, the IL-1β-ERK-RORγtS182 circuit protects against T cell-mediated inflammation and provides potential therapeutic targets to combat autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Female germ cells develop into oocytes, with the capacity for totipotency. In most animals, these remarkable cells are specified during development and cannot be regenerated. By contrast, planarians, known for their regenerative prowess, can regenerate germ cells. To uncover mechanisms required for female germ cell development and regeneration, we generated gonad-specific transcriptomes and identified genes whose expression defines progressive stages of female germ cell development. Strikingly, early female germ cells share molecular signatures with the pluripotent stem cells driving planarian regeneration. We observe spatial heterogeneity within somatic ovarian cells and find that a regionally enriched foxL homolog is required for oocyte differentiation, but not specification, suggestive of functionally distinct somatic compartments. Unexpectedly, a neurotransmitter-biosynthetic enzyme, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), is also expressed in somatic gonadal cells, and plays opposing roles in female and male germ cell development. Thus, somatic gonadal cells deploy conserved factors to regulate germ cell development and regeneration in planarians.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer histological images contain rich biological and clinical information, but quantitative representation can be problematic and has prevented the direct comparison and accumulation of large-scale datasets. Here, we show successful universal encoding of cancer histology by deep texture representations (DTRs) produced by a bilinear convolutional neural network. DTR-based, unsupervised histological profiling, which captures the morphological diversity, is applied to cancer biopsies and reveals relationships between histologic characteristics and the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Content-based image retrieval based on DTRs enables the quick retrieval of histologically similar images using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Furthermore, via comprehensive comparisons with driver and clinically actionable gene mutations, we successfully predict 309 combinations of genomic features and cancer types from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained images. With its mounting capabilities on accessible devices, such as smartphones, universal encoding for cancer histology has a strong impact on global equalization for cancer diagnosis and therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin-binding protein 53BP1 promotes DNA repair by orchestrating the recruitment of downstream effectors including PTIP, RIF1, and shieldin to DNA double-strand break sites. While we know how PTIP recognizes 53BP1, the molecular details of RIF1 recruitment to DNA-damage sites remains undefined. Here, we report that RIF1 is a phosphopeptide-binding protein that directly interacts with three phosphorylated 53BP1 epitopes. The RIF1-binding sites on 53BP1 share an essential LxL motif followed by two closely apposed phosphorylated residues. Simultaneous mutation of these sites on 53BP1 abrogates RIF1 accumulation into ionizing-radiation-induced foci, but surprisingly, only fully compromises 53BP1-dependent DNA repair when an alternative mode of shieldin recruitment to DNA-damage sites is also disabled. Intriguingly, this alternative mode of recruitment still depends on RIF1 but does not require its interaction with 53BP1. RIF1 therefore employs phosphopeptide recognition to promote DNA repair but also modifies shieldin action independently of 53BP1 binding.

Abstract: Summary
Cognitive flexibility enables effective switching between mental processes to generate appropriate responses. Cholinergic neurons (CNs) within the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) are associated with many functions, but their contribution to cognitive flexibility remains poorly understood. Here we measure PPN cholinergic activities using calcium indicators during the attentional set-shifting task. We find that PPN CNs exhibit increasing activities correlated with rewards during each stage and error trials in reversal stages, indicating sensitivity to rule switching. Inhibition of PPN cholinergic activity selectively impairs reversal learning, which improves with PPN CN activation. Activation of PPN CNs projecting to the substantia nigra pars compacta, mediodorsal thalamus, and parafascicular nucleus in a time-locked manner with reward improves reversal learning. Therefore, PPN CNs may encode not only reward signals but also the information of changing reward contingency that contributes to guiding reversal learning through output projections to multiple nuclei that participate in flexibility.

Abstract: Summary
Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) are essential ubiquitylation enzymes that combine a catalytic core built around cullin scaffolds with ∼300 exchangeable substrate adaptors. To ensure robust signal transduction, cells must constantly form new CRLs by pairing substrate-bound adaptors with their cullins, but how this occurs at the right time and place is still poorly understood. Here, we show that formation of individual CRL complexes is a tightly regulated process. Using CUL3KLHL12 as a model, we found that its co-adaptor PEF1-ALG2 initiates CRL3 formation by releasing KLHL12 from an assembly inhibitor at the endoplasmic reticulum, before co-adaptor monoubiquitylation stabilizes the enzyme for substrate modification. As the co-adaptor also helps recruit substrates, its role in CRL assembly couples target recognition to ubiquitylation. We propose that regulators dedicated to specific CRLs, such as assembly inhibitors or co-adaptors, cooperate with target-agnostic adaptor exchange mechanisms to establish E3 ligase complexes that control metazoan development.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA m6A modification is heavily involved in modulation of immune responses. However, its function in antiviral immunity is controversial, and how immune responses regulate m6A modification remains elusive. We here find TBK1, a key kinase of antiviral pathways, phosphorylates the core m6A methyltransferase METTL3 at serine 67. The phosphorylated METTL3 interacts with the translational complex, which is required for enhancing protein translation, thus facilitating antiviral responses. TBK1 also promotes METTL3 activation and m6A modification to stabilize IRF3 mRNA. Type I interferon (IFN) induction is severely impaired in METTL3-deficient cells. Mettl3fl/fl-lyz2-Cre mice are more susceptible to influenza A virus (IAV)-induced lethality than control mice. Consistently, Ythdf1−/− mice show higher mortality than wild-type mice due to decreased IRF3 expression and subsequently attenuated IFN production. Together, we demonstrate that innate signals activate METTL3 via TBK1, and METTL3-mediated m6A modification secures antiviral immunity by promoting mRNA stability and protein translation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which astrocytes modulate neural homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and memory are still poorly explored. Astrocytes form large intercellular networks by gap junction coupling, mainly composed of two gap junction channel proteins, connexin 30 (Cx30) and connexin 43 (Cx43). To circumvent developmental perturbations and to test whether astrocytic gap junction coupling is required for hippocampal neural circuit function and behavior, we generate and study inducible, astrocyte-specific Cx30 and Cx43 double knockouts. Surprisingly, disrupting astrocytic coupling in adult mice results in broad activation of astrocytes and microglia, without obvious signs of pathology. We show that hippocampal CA1 neuron excitability, excitatory synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation are significantly affected. Moreover, behavioral inspection reveals deficits in sensorimotor performance and a complete lack of spatial learning and memory. Together, our findings establish that astrocytic connexins and an intact astroglial network in the adult brain are vital for neural homeostasis, plasticity, and spatial cognition.

Abstract: A blood smear is a common type of blood test where blood sample is taken from a patient, smear is made from the sample followed by observation of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. A pathologist carefully observes the sample and manually counts the number of RBC, WBC and platelets. This entire process from creating a smear to manually counting each element is tedious and susceptible to human errors. That is why, with the advancement of deep learning, various object detection techniques have become useful for automating the process and mitigating human errors in blood smear analysis. This work presents a comparative assessment of three different object detection models namely Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet D3 and CenterNet Hourglass, and presents their respective inference results. The three models have been compared using the COCO evaluation metrics to identify the best model performance for the given task. It is observed that out of the three models, the Faster R-CNN model performs the best in detecting WBCs and platelets in microscopic blood smear images with an average precision of 99.4%. Critical tasks like medical image processing require accurate predictions to prevent unintended ramifications. Therefore, while slower in terms of inference time, Faster R-CNN is the go-to model where accuracy is the priority. The work is also compared with the existing work in this domain to prove its efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are developmental neurotoxicants implicated as environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we report the effects of prenatal exposure to a human-relevant mixture of PCBs on the DNA methylation profiles of mouse placenta and fetal brain. Thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) distinguish placenta and fetal brain from PCB-exposed mice from sex-matched vehicle controls. In both placenta and fetal brain, PCB-associated DMRs are enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment and cellular signaling and enriched within regions of bivalent chromatin. The placenta and brain PCB DMRs overlap significantly and map to a shared subset of genes enriched for Wnt signaling, Slit/Robo signaling, and genes differentially expressed in NDD models. The consensus PCB DMRs also significantly overlap with DMRs from human NDD brain and placenta. These results demonstrate that PCB-exposed placenta contains a subset of DMRs that overlap fetal brain DMRs relevant to an NDD.

Abstract: Background
Fluoxetine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly used antidepressants in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class. The aim of work: The study was conducted to detect the effect of chronic fluoxetine treatment on pars distalis and the possible therapeutic effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs).
Material and method
Thirty healthy male adult albino rats were classified into four groups. Control group (Group I) included fifteen rats. Fluoxetine treated (Group II) included five rats that received 24 mg/kg/day of fluoxetine dissolved in 1.0 ml of tap water once a day for 30 days. Fluoxetine group treated with ADSCs (Group III) included five rats that received fluoxetine as group (II) for 30 days, then supplied once by ADSCs at a dose of 1 × 106 cells/rat in the tail vein suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Recovery group (Group IV) included five rats that received fluoxetine as the group (II) then received no treatment till the end of the experiment. Samples from pars distalis were processed for light, electron microscopic examination, morphometrical and statistical analyses.
Results
In the fluoxetine-treated group, there was a disruption in cellular architecture, size, shape, and staining characteristics of pars distalis cells. The administration of ADSCs significantly improved the microscopic appearance of cells, while the recovery group showed some histological changes similar to the fluoxetine group.
Conclusion
Fluoxetine induced various deleterious changes in the pars distalis of albino rats. These changes were almost corrected by the ADSCs treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Type 4 P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) actively and selectively translocate phospholipids across membrane bilayers. Driven by ATP hydrolysis, P4-ATPases undergo conformational changes during lipid flipping. It is unclear how the active flipping states of P4-ATPases are regulated in the lipid membranes, especially for phosphatidylcholine (PC)-flipping P4-ATPases whose substrate, PC, is a substantial component of membranes. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy structures of a yeast PC-flipping P4-ATPase, Dnf1, in lipid environments. In native yeast lipids, Dnf1 adopts a conformation in which the lipid flipping pathway is disrupted. Only when the lipid composition is changed can Dnf1 be captured in the active conformations that enable lipid flipping. These results suggest that, in the native membrane, Dnf1 may stay in an idle conformation that is unable to support the trans-membrane movement of lipids. Dnf1 may have altered conformational preferences in membranes with different lipid compositions.

Abstract: Summary
Thyroid hormones (THs) are key metabolic regulators coordinating short- and long-term energy needs. In skeletal muscle, THs modulate energy metabolism in pathophysiological conditions. Indeed, hypo- and hyperthyroidism are leading causes of muscle weakness and strength; however, the metabolic pathways underlying these effects are still poorly understood. Using molecular, biochemical, and isotope-tracing approaches combined with mass spectrometry and denervation experiments, we find that THs regulate glutamine metabolism and anaplerotic fluxes by up-regulating the glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) gene. In humans, GPT2 autosomal recessive mutations cause a neurological syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and progressive motor symptoms. Here, we demonstrate a role of the TH/GPT2 axis in skeletal muscle in which it regulates muscle weight and fiber diameter in resting and atrophic conditions and results in protection from muscle loss during atrophy. These results describe an anabolic route by which THs rewire glutamine metabolism toward the maintenance of muscle mass.

Abstract: Summary
Folding of stringent clients requires transfer from Hsp70 to Hsp90. The co-chaperone Hop physically connects the chaperone machineries. Here, we define its role from the remodeling of Hsp70/40-client complexes to the mechanism of client transfer and the conformational switching from stalled to active client-processing states of Hsp90. We show that Hsp70 together with Hsp40 completely unfold a stringent client, the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) in large assemblies. Hop remodels these for efficient transfer onto Hsp90. As p23 enters, Hsp70 leaves the complex via switching between binding sites in Hop. Current concepts assume that to proceed to client folding, Hop dissociates and the co-chaperone p23 stabilizes the Hsp90 closed state. In contrast, we show that p23 functionally interacts with Hop, relieves the stalling Hsp90-Hop interaction, and closes Hsp90. This reaction allows folding of the client and is thus the key regulatory step for the progression of the chaperone cycle.

Abstract: Summary
The factors that promote T cell expansion are not fully known. Creatine is an abundant circulating metabolite that has recently been implicated in T cell function; however, its cell-autonomous role in immune-cell function is unknown. Here, we show that creatine supports cell-intrinsic CD8+ T cell homeostasis. We further identify creatine kinase B (CKB) as the creatine kinase isoenzyme that supports these T cell properties. Loss of the creatine transporter (Slc6a8) or Ckb results in compromised CD8+ T cell expansion in response to infection without influencing adenylate energy charge. Rather, loss of Slc6a8 or Ckb disrupts naive T cell homeostasis and weakens TCR-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling required for CD8+ T cell expansion. These data demonstrate a cell-intrinsic role for creatine transport and creatine transphosphorylation, independent of their effects on global cellular energy charge, in supporting CD8+ T cell homeostasis and effector function.

Abstract: Summary
The histone chaperone complex FACT comprises SPT16 and SSRP1 and contributes to DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but how it plays such various roles is unclear. Here, we show that human SPT16 is ubiquitylated at lysine-674 (K674) by the DCAF14-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. K674 is located in the middle domain of SPT16, and the corresponding residue of the yeast ortholog is critical for binding to histone H3.1-H4. We show that the middle domain of human SPT16 binds to histone H3.1-H4 and that this binding is inhibited by K674 ubiquitylation. Cells with heterozygous knockin of a K674R mutant of SPT16 manifest reduction of both SPT16 ubiquitylation and H3.1 in chromatin, a reduced population in mid S phase, impaired proliferation, and increased susceptibility to S phase stress. Our data thus indicate that SPT16 ubiquitylation by DCAF14-CRL4 regulates FACT binding to histones and may thereby control DNA replication-coupled histone incorporation into chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive brain tumors characterized by extensive inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Patient-derived models, such as organoids and explants, have recently emerged as useful models to study such heterogeneity, although the extent to which they can recapitulate GBM genomic features remains unclear. Here, we analyze bulk exome and single-cell genome and transcriptome profiles of 12 IDH wild-type GBMs, including two recurrent tumors, and of patient-derived explants (PDEs) and gliomasphere (GS) lines derived from these tumors. We find that PDEs are genetically similar to, and variably retain gene expression characteristics of, their parent tumors. Notably, PDEs appear to exhibit similar levels of transcriptional heterogeneity compared with their parent tumors, whereas GS lines tend to be enriched for cells in a more uniform transcriptional state. The approaches and datasets introduced here will provide a valuable resource to help guide experiments using GBM-derived models, especially in the context of studying cellular heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytosis, signal transduction, and inflammatory responses require changes in lipid metabolism. Peroxisomes have key roles in fatty acid homeostasis and in regulating immune function. We find that Drosophila macrophages lacking peroxisomes have perturbed lipid profiles, which reduce host survival after infection. Using lipidomic, transcriptomic, and genetic screens, we determine that peroxisomes contribute to the cell membrane glycerophospholipid composition necessary to induce Rho1-dependent signals, which drive cytoskeletal remodeling during macrophage activation. Loss of peroxisome function increases membrane phosphatidic acid (PA) and recruits RhoGAPp190 during infection, inhibiting Rho1-mediated responses. Peroxisome-glycerophospholipid-Rho1 signaling also controls cytoskeleton remodeling in mouse immune cells. While high levels of PA in cells without peroxisomes inhibit inflammatory phenotypes, large numbers of peroxisomes and low amounts of cell membrane PA are features of immune cells from patients with inflammatory Kawasaki disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Our findings reveal potential metabolic markers and therapeutic targets for immune diseases and metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Complex somatic genomic rearrangements and copy number alterations are hallmarks of nearly all cancers. We have developed an algorithm, LINX, to aid interpretation of structural variant and copy number data derived from short-read, whole-genome sequencing. LINX classifies raw structural variant calls into distinct events and predicts their effect on the local structure of the derivative chromosome and the functional impact on affected genes. Visualizations facilitate further investigation of complex rearrangements. LINX allows insights into a diverse range of structural variation events and can reliably detect pathogenic rearrangements, including gene fusions, immunoglobulin enhancer rearrangements, intragenic deletions, and duplications. Uniquely, LINX also predicts chained fusions that we demonstrate account for 13% of clinically relevant oncogenic fusions. LINX also reports a class of inactivation events that we term homozygous disruptions that may be a driver mutation in up to 9% of tumors and may frequently affect PTEN, TP53, and RB1.

Abstract: Summary
The transition between quiescence and activation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) is coupled with reversible changes in energy metabolism with key implications for lifelong NSPC self-renewal and neurogenesis. How this metabolic plasticity is ensured between NSPC activity states is unclear. We find that a state-specific rewiring of the mitochondrial proteome by the i-AAA peptidase YME1L is required to preserve NSPC self-renewal. YME1L controls the abundance of numerous mitochondrial substrates in quiescent NSPCs, and its deletion activates a differentiation program characterized by broad metabolic changes causing the irreversible shift away from a fatty-acid-oxidation-dependent state. Conditional Yme1l deletion in adult NSPCs in vivo results in defective self-renewal and premature differentiation, ultimately leading to NSPC pool depletion. Our results disclose an important role for YME1L in coordinating the switch between metabolic states of NSPCs and suggest that NSPC fate is regulated by compartmentalized changes in protein network dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Diet is a key regulator of metabolism and interacts with the intestinal microbiome. Here, we study the role of the Drosophila intestinal stem cell (ISC)-specific biotin transporter Smvt in midgut homeostasis, infection-induced regeneration, and tumorigenesis. We show that Smvt-transported biotin in ISCs is necessary for ISC mitosis. Smvt deficiency impairs intestinal maintenance, which can be rescued by the human Smvt, encoded by SLC5A6. ISC-specific, Smvt-silenced flies exhibit microbial dysbiosis, whereby the growth of Providencia sneebia, an opportunistic pathogen, is favored. Dysbiosis correlates with increased Nox expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enterocyte apoptosis. Flies acquire biotin from their diet and microbiota. We show that, when dietary biotin is scarce, biotin-producing commensals, e.g., E. coli, can rescue reduced ISC mitosis. Smvt and commensals also control intestinal tumor growth. Our findings suggest that direct modification of the gut microbiome by biotin can serve as an approach for the treatment of dysbiosis-promoted diseases and tumorigenesis control.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing generates distinct mRNA variants and is essential for development, homeostasis, and renewal. Proteins of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich splicing factor family are major splicing regulators that are broadly required for organ development as well as cell and organism viability. However, how these proteins support adult organ function remains largely unknown. Here, we used the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model to dissect the functions of the prototypical SR family protein SRSF1 during tissue homeostasis and renewal. We identified an SRSF1-governed alternative splicing network that is specifically required for dental proliferation and survival of progenitors but dispensable for the viability of differentiated cells. We also observed a similar progenitor-specific role of SRSF1 in the small intestinal epithelium, indicating a conserved function of SRSF1 across adult epithelial tissues. Thus, our findings define a regulatory mechanism by which SRSF1 specifically controls progenitor-specific alternative splicing events to support adult tissue homeostasis and renewal.

Abstract: The incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases after surgery and is associated with the activation of NLRP3-inflammation. Our previous studies have found that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) blockade reduces the susceptibility to AF, but its molecular mechanisms remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that blockage of TRPV4 reduces the incidence of AF by inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasome in sterile pericarditis (SP) mice. In this study, we established SP mice by dusting talcum powder on atrial surfaces. We first confirmed that genetic or pharmacological TRPV4 inhibition reduced the susceptibility to AF in SP mice. We also found that the expression level of NLRP3-inflammasome and inflammatory cytokines significantly increased in the atria of SP mice, which further increased in application the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (GSK101) and decreased in application the TRPV4 antagonist GSK2193874. More importantly, ERK inhibitor (U0126) or NF-κB inhibitor (Bay11–7082) could partially reverse GSK101-induced NLRP3-inflammasome up-regulation. Interestingly, U0126 can reversed GSK101-induced NF-κB phosphorylation, but Bay11–7082 cannot change GSK101-induced ERK phosphorylation. Finally, we shown that the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome and ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway significantly reduced in TRPV4-knockout SP mice. Collectively, our studies indicate that blockage of TRPV4 prevents AF in SP mice by inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasome through the ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: FGF and anti-BMP signals from the Spemann organizer of mesodermal origin are essential for Xenopus neural development from gastrula ectoderm. However, the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms of signaling, especially those underlying the neural induction process, are still controversial. We show here that the expression of early neural marker genes such as sox2 and otx2 is suppressed both in vivo and in vitro, when ectoderm cells are loaded with a dominant-negative construct of Ets transcription factors or a translation-blocking antisense FGF2 MO or FGF8 MO, respectively. This indicates that the expression of these FGF signaling molecules in ectoderm cells contributes significantly to neural induction, in contrast to the “neural default model” that has been emphasized, in which anti-BMP signaling from the organizer plays a major role in the neural induction in Xenopus. Our results indicate that cell-autonomous FGF signaling between ectoderm cells, rather than paracrine signaling from organizer cells, directly induces the expression of sox2 and otx2 via the FGF2, FGF8/MAPK/Ets pathway at very low signaling levels. This is independent of inhibiting BMP signaling via the FGF/MAPK/Smad pathway, which has been proposed as the primary pathway for FGF signaling in Xenopus neural induction. Using cultured ectoderm cells, we also obtained results suggesting that the mode of contribution of FGF signaling to neural development is altered during the subsequent neural patterning stage. As we increase the amounts of FGF in the culture medium, anterior neural genes activated at low FGF signaling levels are suppressed, and instead position-specific, more posterior neural genes are activated in a dose-dependent manner via the FGF/MAPK/Ets pathway. These results support the claim that morphogenic FGFs from the organizer diffuse in a paracrine manner through the plane of the induced neuroectoderm, causing anteroposterior patterning of neural tissue.

Abstract: Background
Osteosarcoma is a prevalent malignant bone tumor with a tendency to metastasize to the lungs. In this study, we intend to detect the function and mechanism of DIRAS family GTPase 1 (DIRAS1) in osteosarcoma cells.
Methods
Expression level of DIRAS1 in osteosarcoma cells was analyzed by western blot. Cell location of DIRAS1 in osteosarcoma cells was detected by immunofluorescence. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA)-DIRAS1 and pcDNA3.1-DIRAS1 were employed to regulate DIRAS1 expression. The malignant behaviors of osteosarcoma cells were examined by cell counting kit-8, colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays. The expression of related proteins was measured by western blot. ELISA and dot blot assays were used to detect the methylation level of m6A. Rescue assays were performed to detect the function of METTL3/METTL14 and DIRASI on osteosarcoma cells.
Results
DIRAS1 was located in the nucleus of osteosarcoma cells. Silencing of DIRAS1 in MG63 cells strengthened the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities, as well as blocked the apoptosis ability. Also, p-ERK expression was regulated by DIRAS1 expression, while p-AKT was not affected. Furthermore, DIRAS1 expression was suppressed by METTL3 or/and METTL14 treatment. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of DIRAS1 overexpression on HOS cells malignant behaviors can be reversed by METTL3 and METTL14 joint treatment. The reduced expression of p-ERK induced by DIRAS1 overexpression can be inversed by METTL3 and METTL14 co-treatment.
Conclusions
Taken together, our findings illustrated that DIRAS1 regulated by METTL3 and METTL14 can obviously modulate the malignant behaviors of osteosarcoma cells by inactivating ERK pathway.

Abstract: Independent of its function as a subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the Cavβ3 subunit desensitizes fibroblasts and pancreatic β-cells to low concentrations of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). This alters agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling and cellular functions, for example, insulin secretion and wound healing. A total of four Cavβ subunits exist, Cavβ1, Cavβ2, Cavβ3, and Cavβ4. To investigate whether the other Cavβ subunits, like Cavβ3, can desensitize cells to IP3 and thereby modulate Ca2+ signaling, we expressed the cDNAs of Cavβ1, Cavβ2, Cavβ3, and Cavβ4 in COS-7 cells lacking endogenous Cavβ proteins. ATP stimulation of these cells results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This receptor-mediated Ca2+ release is significantly decreased by Cavβ3 but not by Cavβ1, Cavβ2, and Cavβ4. Electrophysiological recordings of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents from fibroblasts show a small Ca2+ current, the amplitude of which is slightly but not significantly smaller in fibroblasts from Cavβ2 gene-deficient animals than in fibroblasts from wild-type animals. Compared with fibroblasts from wild-type animals, Ca2+ release is not significantly increased in Cavβ2-deficient fibroblasts, in contrast to Ca2+ release in Cavβ3-deficient fibroblasts. In summary, our results show that desensitization of cells to low concentrations of IP3 is a specific property of Cavβ3 that is not shared by other Cavβ subunits.

Abstract: Summary
Plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs) are developmental tumors that appear in neurofibromatosis type 1 individuals, constituting a major source of morbidity and potentially transforming into a highly metastatic sarcoma (MPNST). pNFs arise after NF1 inactivation in a cell of the neural crest (NC)-Schwann cell (SC) lineage. Here, we develop an iPSC-based NC-SC in vitro differentiation system and construct a lineage expression roadmap for the analysis of different 2D and 3D NF models. The best model consists of generating heterotypic spheroids (neurofibromaspheres) composed of iPSC-derived differentiating NF1(−/−) SCs and NF1(+/−) pNF-derived fibroblasts (Fbs). Neurofibromaspheres form by maintaining highly proliferative NF1(−/−) cells committed to the NC-SC axis due to SC-SC and SC-Fb interactions, resulting in SC linage cells at different maturation points. Upon engraftment on the mouse sciatic nerve, neurofibromaspheres consistently generate human NF-like tumors. Analysis of expression roadmap genes in human pNF single-cell RNA-seq data uncovers the presence of SC subpopulations at distinct differentiation states.

Abstract: Summary
Insect salivary glands have been previously shown to function in pupal attachment and food lubrication by secreting factors into the lumen via an exocrine way. Here, we find in Drosophila that a salivary gland-derived secreted factor (Sgsf) peptide regulates systemic growth via an endocrine way. Sgsf is specifically expressed in salivary glands and secreted into the hemolymph. Sgsf knockout or salivary gland-specific Sgsf knockdown decrease the size of both the body and organs, phenocopying the effects of genetic ablation of salivary glands, while salivary gland-specific Sgsf overexpression increases their size. Sgsf promotes systemic growth by modulating the secretion of the insulin-like peptide Dilp2 from the brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs) and affecting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the fat body. Altogether, our study demonstrates that Sgsf mediates the roles of salivary glands in Drosophila systemic growth, establishing an endocrine function of salivary glands.

Abstract: SERTA domain-containing protein 1 (Sertad1) is upregulated in the models of DNA damage and Alzheimer’s disease, contributing to neuronal death. However, the role and mechanism of Sertad1 in ischemic/hypoxic neurological injury remain unclear. In the present study, our results showed that the expression of Sertad1 was upregulated in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion model and in HT22 cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Sertad1 knockdown significantly ameliorated ischemia-induced brain infarct volume, neurological deficits and neuronal apoptosis. In addition, it significantly ameliorated the OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell viability and apoptotic cell death in HT22 cells. Sertad1 knockdown significantly inhibited the ischemic/hypoxic-induced expression of p-Rb, B-Myb, and Bim in vivo and in vitro. However, Sertad1 overexpression significantly exacerbated the OGD/R-induced inhibition of cell viability and apoptotic cell death and p-Rb, B-Myb, and Bim expression in HT22 cells. In further studies, we demonstrated that Sertad1 directly binds to CDK4 and the CDK4 inhibitor ON123300 restores the effects of Sertad1 overexpression on OGD/R-induced apoptotic cell death and p-Rb, B-Myb, and Bim expression in HT22 cells. These results suggested that Sertad1 contributed to ischemic/hypoxic neurological injury by activating the CDK4/p-Rb pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are liver-resident antigen (cross)-presenting cells that generate memory CD8 T cells, but metabolic properties of LSECs and LSEC-primed CD8 T cells remain understudied. Here, we report that high-level mitochondrial respiration and constitutive low-level glycolysis support LSEC scavenger and sentinel functions. LSECs fail to increase glycolysis and co-stimulation after TLR4 activation, indicating absence of metabolic and functional maturation compared with immunogenic dendritic cells. LSEC-primed CD8 T cells show a transient burst of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Mechanistically, co-stimulatory IL-6 signaling ensures high FOXO1 expression in LSEC-primed CD8 T cells, curtails metabolic activity associated with T cell activation, and is indispensable for T cell functionality after re-activation. Thus, distinct immunometabolic features characterize non-immunogenic LSECs compared with immunogenic dendritic cells and LSEC-primed CD8 T cells with memory features compared with effector CD8 T cells. This reveals local features of metabolism and function of T cells in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein E transports lipids and couples metabolism between astrocytes and neurons. The E4 variant (APOE4) affects these functions and represents a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We show that ApoE produces different types of lipoproteins via distinct lipidation pathways. ApoE forms high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like, cholesterol-rich particles via the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), a mechanism largely unaffected by ApoE polymorphism. Alternatively, ectopic accumulation of fat in astrocytes, a stress-associated condition, redirects ApoE toward the assembly and secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, a process boosted by the APOE4 variant. We demonstrate in vitro that ApoE can detect triacylglycerol in membranes and spontaneously assemble lipoprotein particles (10–20 nm) rich in unsaturated triacylglycerol, and that APOE4 has remarkable properties behaving as a strong triacylglycerol binder. We propose that fatty APOE4 astrocytes have reduced ability to clear toxic fatty acids from the extracellular milieu, because APOE4 reroutes them back to secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol molecules specifically bind to the resting αβTCR to inhibit cytoplasmic CD3ζ ITAM phosphorylation through sequestering the TCR-CD3 complex in an inactive conformation. The mechanisms of cholesterol-mediated inhibition of TCR-CD3 and its activation remain unclear. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy structures of cholesterol- and cholesterol sulfate (CS)-inhibited TCR-CD3 complexes and an auto-active TCR-CD3 variant. The structures reveal that cholesterol molecules act like a latch to lock CD3ζ into an inactive conformation in the membrane. Mutations impairing binding of cholesterol molecules to the tunnel result in the movement of the proximal C terminus of the CD3ζ transmembrane helix, thereby activating the TCR-CD3 complex in human cells. Together, our data reveal the structural basis of TCR inhibition by cholesterol, illustrate how the cholesterol-binding tunnel is allosterically coupled to TCR triggering, and lay a foundation for the development of immunotherapies through directly targeting the TCR-CD3 complex.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired production of thymic regulatory T cells (Tregs) is implicated in the development of Aire-dependent autoimmunity. Because Tregs require agonistic T cell receptor stimuli by self-antigens to develop, reduced expression of self-antigens from medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) has been considered to play a major role in the reduced Treg production in Aire deficiency. Here, we show that mTECs abnormally express co-inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 if Aire is non-functional. Upon binding with CD80/CD86 ligands expressed on thymic dendritic cells (DCs), the ectopically expressed CTLA-4 from Aire-deficient mTECs removes the CD80/CD86 ligands from the DCs. This attenuates the ability of DCs to provide co-stimulatory signals and to present self-antigens transferred from mTECs, both of which are required for Treg production. Accordingly, impaired production of Tregs and organ-specific autoimmunity in Aire-deficient mice are rescued by the depletion of CTLA-4 expression from mTECs. Our studies illuminate the significance of mTEC-DC interaction coordinated by Aire for the establishment of thymic tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Primary human hepatocytes are widely used to evaluate liver toxicity of drugs, but they are scarce and demanding to culture. Stem cell-derived hepatocytes are increasingly discussed as alternatives. To obtain a better appreciation of the molecular processes during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into hepatocytes, we employ a quantitative proteomic approach to follow the expression of 9,000 proteins, 12,000 phosphorylation sites, and 800 acetylation sites over time. The analysis reveals stage-specific markers, a major molecular switch between hepatic endoderm versus immature hepatocyte-like cells impacting, e.g., metabolism, the cell cycle, kinase activity, and the expression of drug transporters. Comparing the proteomes of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)-derived hepatocytes with fetal and adult liver indicates a fetal-like status of the in vitro models and lower expression of important ADME/Tox proteins. The collective data enable constructing a molecular roadmap of hepatocyte development that serves as a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Summary
Infection and vaccination repeatedly expose individuals to antigens that are conserved between influenza virus subtypes. Nevertheless, antibodies recognizing variable influenza epitopes greatly outnumber antibodies reactive against conserved epitopes. Elucidating factors contributing to the paucity of broadly reactive influenza antibodies remains a major obstacle for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Here, we report that inducing broadly reactive influenza antibodies increases autoreactive antibodies in humans and mice and exacerbates disease in four distinct models of autoimmune disease. Importantly, transferring broadly reactive influenza antibodies augments disease in the presence of inflammation or autoimmune susceptibility. Further, broadly reactive influenza antibodies spontaneously arise in mice with defects in B cell tolerance. Together, these data suggest that self-tolerance mechanisms limit the prevalence of broadly reactive influenza antibodies, which can exacerbate disease in the context of additional risk factors.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Env is heavily glycosylated with host-derived N-glycans, and many bnAbs bind to, or are dependent upon, Env glycans for neutralization. Although glycan-binding bnAbs are frequently detected in HIV-infected individuals, attempts to elicit them have been unsuccessful because of the poor immunogenicity of Env N-glycans. Here, we report cross-reactivity of glycan-binding bnAbs with self- and non-self N-glycans and glycoprotein antigens from different life-stages of Schistosoma mansoni. Using the IAVI Protocol C HIV infection cohort, we examine the relationship between S. mansoni seropositivity and development of bnAbs targeting glycan-dependent epitopes. We show that the unmutated common ancestor of the N332/V3-specific bnAb lineage PCDN76, isolated from an HIV-infected donor with S. mansoni seropositivity, binds to S. mansoni cercariae while lacking reactivity to gp120. Overall, these results present a strategy for elicitation of glycan-reactive bnAbs which could be exploited in HIV-1 vaccine development.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a poor prognosis. We report a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of bone marrow biopsies from 252 uniformly treated AML patients to elucidate the molecular pathophysiology of AML in order to inform future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In addition to in-depth quantitative proteomics, our analysis includes cytogenetic profiling and DNA/RNA sequencing. We identify five proteomic AML subtypes, each reflecting specific biological features spanning genomic boundaries. Two of these proteomic subtypes correlate with patient outcome, but none is exclusively associated with specific genomic aberrations. Remarkably, one subtype (Mito-AML), which is captured only in the proteome, is characterized by high expression of mitochondrial proteins and confers poor outcome, with reduced remission rate and shorter overall survival on treatment with intensive induction chemotherapy. Functional analyses reveal that Mito-AML is metabolically wired toward stronger complex I-dependent respiration and is more responsive to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.

Abstract: Summary
The functional consequence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is mediated by “reader” proteins of the YTH family. YTH domain-containing 2 (YTHDC2) is essential for mammalian fertility, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here, we identify U-rich motifs as binding sites of YTHDC2 on 3′ UTRs of mouse testicular RNA targets. Although its YTH domain is an m6A-binder in vitro, the YTH point mutant mice are fertile. Significantly, the loss of its 3′→5′ RNA helicase activity causes mouse infertility, with the catalytic-dead mutation being dominant negative. Biochemical studies reveal that the weak helicase activity of YTHDC2 is enhanced by its interaction with the 5′→3′ exoribonuclease XRN1. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that Ythdc2 mutant mitotic germ cells transition into meiosis but accumulate a transcriptome with mixed mitotic/meiotic identity that fail to progress further into meiosis. Finally, our demonstration that ythdc2 mutant zebrafish are infertile highlights its conserved role in animal germ cell development.

Abstract: Summary
To investigate changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) during lung cancer progression, we interrogate tumors from two chest computed tomography (CT)-defined groups. Pure non-solid (pNS) CT density nodules contain preinvasive/minimally invasive cancers, and solid density nodules contain invasive cancers. Profiling data reveal a dynamic interaction between the tumor and its TME throughout progression. Alterations in genes regulating the extracellular matrix and genes regulating fibroblasts are central at the preinvasive state. T cell-mediated immune suppression is initiated in preinvasive nodules and sustained with rising intensity through progression to invasive tumors. Reduced T cell infiltration of the cancer cell nests is more frequently associated with preinvasive cancers, possibly until tumor evolution leads to a durable, viable invasive phenotype accompanied by more varied and robust immune suppression. Upregulation of immune checkpoints occurs only in the invasive nodules. Throughout progression, an effector immune response is present but is effectively thwarted by the immune-suppressive elements.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated expression of non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER is an independent prognosticator that correlates with poor survival of high-grade and basal/triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Here, we show that high FER levels are also associated with improved outcomes after adjuvant taxane-based combination chemotherapy in high-risk, HER2-negative patients. In TNBC cells, we observe a causal relation between high FER levels and sensitivity to taxanes. Proteomics and mechanistic studies demonstrate that FER regulates endosomal recycling, a microtubule-dependent process that underpins breast cancer cell invasion. Using chemical genetics, we identify DCTN2 as a FER substrate. Our work indicates that the DCTN2 tyrosine 6 is essential for the development of tubular recycling domains in early endosomes and subsequent propagation of TNBC cell invasion in 3D. In conclusion, we show that high FER expression promotes endosomal recycling and represents a candidate predictive marker for the benefit of adjuvant taxane-containing chemotherapy in high-risk patients, including TNBC patients.

Abstract: Background and aim
This work was conducted to compare the therapeutic potential of undifferentiated and osteogenic differentiated canine (xenogeneic) and guinea pig (allogeneic) BMSCs in fracture healing using guinea pig as a model.
Materials and methods
A well-characterized homogenous population of third passage mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow origin was used in all the experiments. MSCs from both the species, i.e., canine and guinea pigs, were differentiated and characterized. Expression of MHC I and II along with co-stimulatory molecules was assessed based on relative mRNA expression. The osteogenic differentiated and undifferentiated MSCs from both species were used for evaluating fracture healing in the guinea pig model. The healing potential was assessed based on radiographic, histopathology, and clinical observations.
Results
BMSCs from both species expressed MSC surface antigens and successfully differentiated to osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages. The mRNA expression of class I and II MHC molecules in all the three lineages showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences after differentiating to adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages. Radiographic and clinical examination revealed that MSCs therapy significantly improved bone fracture healing with a non-significant (p > 0.05) difference between differentiated and undifferentiated BMSCs. In addition, allogeneic MSCs therapy performed better than xenogeneic therapy.
Conclusion
MSCs remained hypo immunogenic after differentiation and have comparable fracture healing potential though allogeneic MSCs have better therapeutic potential than xenogenic MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal centers (GCs) are essential for antibody affinity maturation. GC B cells have a unique repertoire of cell surface glycans compared with naive B cells, yet functional roles for changes in glycosylation in the GC have yet to be ascribed. Detection of GCs by the antibody GL7 reflects a downregulation in ligands for CD22, an inhibitory co-receptor of the B cell receptor. To test a functional role for downregulation of CD22 ligands in the GC, we generate a mouse model that maintains CD22 ligands on GC B cells. With this model, we demonstrate that glycan remodeling plays a critical role in the maintenance of B cells in the GC. Sustained expression of CD22 ligands induces higher levels of apoptosis in GC B cells, reduces memory B cell and plasma cell output, and delays affinity maturation of antibodies. These defects are CD22 dependent, demonstrating that downregulation of CD22 ligands on B cells plays a critical function in the GC.

Abstract: Summary
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) have been proposed to control single-neuron computations in vivo. However, whether specific mechanisms regulate the function of such receptors and modulate input-output transformations performed by cortical neurons under in vivo-like conditions is understudied. Here, we report that in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (L2/3 PNs), repeated synaptic stimulation results in an activity-dependent decrease in NMDAR function by vesicular zinc. Such a mechanism shifts the threshold for dendritic non-linearities and strongly reduces LTP. Modulation of NMDARs is cell and pathway specific, being present selectively in L2/3-L2/3 connections but absent in inputs originating from L4 neurons. Numerical simulations highlight that activity-dependent modulation of NMDARs influences dendritic computations, endowing L2/3 PN dendrites with the ability to sustain non-linear integrations constant across different regimes of synaptic activity like those found in vivo. Our results unveil vesicular zinc as an important endogenous modulator of dendritic function in cortical PNs.

Abstract: Summary
Haploinsufficiency describes a phenomenon where one functioning allele is insufficient for a normal phenotype, underlying several human diseases. The effect of haploinsufficiency on human embryonic stem cells (hESC) has not been thoroughly studied. To establish a genome-wide loss-of-function screening for heterozygous mutations, we fuse normal haploid hESCs with a library of mutant haploid hESCs. We identify over 600 genes with a negative effect on hESC growth in a haploinsufficient manner and characterize them as genes showing less tolerance to mutations, conservation during evolution, and depletion from telomeres and X chromosome. Interestingly, a large fraction of these genes is associated with extracellular matrix and plasma membrane and enriched for genes within WNT and TGF-β pathways. We thus identify haploinsufficiency-related genes that show growth retardation in early embryonic cells, suggesting dosage-dependent phenotypes in hESCs. Overall, we construct a unique model for studying haploinsufficiency and identified important dosage-dependent pathways involved in hESC growth and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Social dominance is a ubiquitous phenomenon among social animals, including humans. To date, individual attributes leading to dominance (after a contest) remain largely elusive. Here, we report that socially dominant rats can be distinguished from subordinates based on their intestinal microbiota. When dysbiosis is induced, rats are predisposed to a subordinate state, while dysbiotic rats reclaim social dominance following microbiota transplantation. Winning hosts are characterized by core microbes, a majority of which are associated with butyrate production, and the sole colonization of Clostridium butyricum is sufficient to restore dominance. Regarding molecular aspects, a histone deacetylase, HDAC2, is responsive to microbial status and mediates competition outcome; however, this occurs only in a restricted population of cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Furthermore, HDAC2 acts by modulating synaptic activity in mPFC. Together, these findings uncover a link between commensals and host dominance, providing insight into the gut-brain mechanisms underlying dominance determination.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating how neurons encode network activity is essential to understanding how the brain processes information. Neocortical pyramidal cells receive excitatory input onto spines distributed along dendritic branches. Local dendritic branch nonlinearities can boost the response to spatially clustered and synchronous input, but how this translates into the integration of patterns of ongoing activity remains unclear. To examine dendritic integration under naturalistic stimulus regimes, we use two-photon glutamate uncaging to repeatedly activate multiple dendritic spines at random intervals. In the proximal dendrites of two populations of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex, spatially restricted synchrony is not a prerequisite for dendritic boosting. Branches encode afferent inputs with distinct rate sensitivities depending upon cell and branch type. Thus, inputs distributed along a dendritic branch can recruit supralinear boosting and the window of this nonlinearity may provide a mechanism by which dendrites can preferentially amplify slow-frequency network oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we used RNA capture-seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning. Combining these data with cell-type-specific ATAC-seq on neurons that had been selectively activated by fear extinction learning, we find inducible 434 lncRNAs that are derived from enhancer regions in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. In particular, we discover an experience-induced lncRNA we call ADRAM (activity-dependent lncRNA associated with memory) that acts as both a scaffold and a combinatorial guide to recruit the brain-enriched chaperone protein 14-3-3 to the promoter of the memory-associated immediate-early gene Nr4a2 and is required fear extinction memory. This study expands the lexicon of experience-dependent lncRNA activity in the brain and highlights enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) as key players in the epigenomic regulation of gene expression associated with the formation of fear extinction memory.

Abstract: Summary
It is still unknown whether the human interfollicular epidermis harbors a reservoir of melanocyte precursor cells. Here, we clearly distinguish between three distinct types of melanocytes in human interfollicular epidermis: (1) cKit+CD90–, (2) cKit+CD90+, and (3) cKit−CD90+. Importantly, we identify the Kit tyrosine kinase receptor (cKit) as a marker expressed specifically in mature, melanin-producing melanocytes. Thus, both cKit+CD90– and cKit+CD90+ cells represent polydendritic, pigmented mature melanocytes, whereas cKit−CD90+ cells display bipolar, non-dendritic morphology with reduced melanin content. Additionally, using tissue-engineered pigmented dermo-epidermal skin substitutes (melDESSs), we reveal that the cKit expression also plays an important role during melanogenesis in melDESS in vivo. Interestingly, cKit−CD90+ cells lack the expression of markers such as HMB45, TYR, and TRP1 in vitro and in vivo. However, they co-express neural-crest progenitor markers and demonstrate multilineage differentiation potential in vitro. Hence, we propose that cKit−CD90+ cells constitute the precursor melanocyte reservoir in human interfollicular epidermis.

Abstract: Summary
The precise developmental dynamics of the pancreatic islet endocrine cell types, and their interrelation, are unknown. Some authors claim the persistence of islet cell differentiation from precursor cells after birth (“neogenesis”). Here, using four conditional cell lineage tracing (“pulse-and-chase”) murine models, we describe the natural history of pancreatic islet cells, once they express a hormone gene, until late in life. Concerning the contribution of early-appearing embryonic hormone-expressing cells to the formation of islets, we report that adult islet cells emerge from embryonic hormone-expressing cells arising at different time points during development, without any evidence of postnatal neogenesis. We observe specific patterns of hormone gene activation and switching during islet morphogenesis, revealing that, within each cell type, cells have heterogeneous developmental trajectories. This likely applies to most maturating cells in the body, and explains the observed phenotypic variability within differentiated cell types. Such knowledge should help devising novel regenerative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Escape is an evolutionarily conserved and essential avoidance response. Considered to be innate, most studies on escape responses focused on hard-wired circuits. We report here that a neuropeptide NLP-18 and its cholecystokinin receptor CKR-1 enable the escape circuit to execute a full omega (Ω) turn. We demonstrate in vivo NLP-18 is mainly secreted by the gustatory sensory neuron (ASI) to activate CKR-1 in the head motor neuron (SMD) and the turn-initiating interneuron (AIB). Removal of NLP-18 or CKR-1 or specific knockdown of CKR-1 in SMD or AIB neurons leads to shallower turns, hence less robust escape steering. Consistently, elevation of head motor neuron (SMD)'s Ca2+ transients during escape steering is attenuated upon the removal of NLP-18 or CKR-1. In vitro, synthetic NLP-18 directly evokes CKR-1-dependent currents in oocytes and CKR-1-dependent Ca2+ transients in SMD. Thus, cholecystokinin peptidergic signaling modulates an escape circuit to generate robust escape steering.

Abstract: Summary
Recruitment of lymphocytes into tumors is critical for anti-tumor immunity and efficacious immunotherapy. We show in murine models that tumor-associated high endothelial venules (TA-HEVs) are major sites of lymphocyte entry into tumors at baseline and upon treatment with anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). TA-HEV endothelial cells (TA-HECs) derive from post-capillary venules, co-express MECA-79+ HEV sialomucins and E/P-selectins, and are associated with homing and infiltration into tumors of various T cell subsets. Intravital microscopy further shows that TA-HEVs are the main sites of lymphocyte arrest and extravasation into ICB-treated tumors. Increasing TA-HEC frequency and maturation increases the proportion of tumor-infiltrating stem-like CD8+ T cells, and ameliorates ICB efficacy. Analysis of tumor biopsies from 93 patients with metastatic melanoma reveals that TA-HEVs are predictive of better response and survival upon treatment with anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination. These studies provide critical insights into the mechanisms governing lymphocyte trafficking in cancer immunity and immunotherapy.

Abstract: Introduction
BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma) and trichoblastoma are skin tumors originating from the hair follicle. BCC is the most common non-melanoma skin cancer. Differential diagnosis of BCC from trichoblastoma, which is a common benign tumor in terms of histology, morphology, and immunohistochemistry, is not possible. The effects of adipokines on tumorigenesis have attracted attention.
Materials and Methods
By examining the effects of Asprosin and Meteorine like peptide (METRNL) on these tumors, it is aimed to reach new information in the differential diagnosis of BCC and trichoblastoma. Twenty normal healthy tissue, 17 basal cell carcinoma and 12 trichoblastoma samples were included in the study.
Results
Increased expression of Asprosin and METRNL was observed in tumor and stromal tissues in BCC. Although overexpression of METRNL was observed in the lesion area in trichoblastoma, no increase in Asprosin expression was observed. Asprosin and METRNL immunoreactivity were found to be statistically significantly higher in BCC samples compared to control and trichoblastoma.
Conclusion
Asprosin and METRNL can be used in the diagnosis of BCC. METRNL can be used in the diagnosis of trichoblastoma. These biomarkers are helpful for differentiation between BCC and trichoblastoma.

Abstract: Radiation-induced damage to salivary glands (SG) is a consequence of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Recovery of the irradiated SG has been studied using various regenerative approaches. This study aims to compare the regenerative potentials of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) on irradiated rat submandibular salivary glands (SMD). 32 healthy male albino rats were irradiated with a single dose of 6 Gy then classified into four groups. Group A received no treatment while the other 3 groups were injected 24 h post-radiation with a single dose of either; BMMCs (Group B), PRP (Group C), or BMMCs suspended in PRP (Group D). SMD regeneration was assessed in terms of histological changes and TGF- β1 gene expression. The results showed that compared to the untreated group all groups showed successful regeneration with group D showing the best results. A statistically significant increase in the surface area of acini and TGF- β1 gene expression was observed in group D, followed by group C, then B. Our results prove that using PRP and BMMCs could be promising in decreasing irradiation side effects on SG. Moreover, combining PRP and BMMCs gives better effects compared to each therapy alone.

Abstract: Summary
The protein C receptor (Procr) has been implicated as a stem cell surface marker in several tissues. It is unknown whether Procr acts as a functional signaling receptor in stem cells. Here, by conditional knockout in mammary stem cells (MaSCs), we demonstrate that Procr is essential for mammary gland development and homeostasis. Through proteomics profiling, we identify that, upon stimulation by the ligand protein C, Procr interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90AA1) via its short cytoplasmic tail, recruiting Src and IGF1R to the complex at the plasma membrane. We show that Procr acts as a signaling receptor of protein C in regulation of MaSCs through HSP90, Src, and IGF1R in vitro. In vivo, IGF1R deletion in MaSCs displays similar phenotypes to Procr deletion. These findings illustrate the essential role of Procr signaling in MaSC maintenance, shedding light onto the molecular regulation by Procr in tissue stem cells.

Abstract: The role of long non-coding RNA ACTA2 antisense RNA 1 (LncRNA ACTA2-AS1) in colorectal cancer (CRC) was awaited to be elucidated. Clinical specimen and data on ACTA2-AS1 expression in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) were collected, followed by in situ hybridization. Transfected CRC cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined with Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Scratch, and Transwell assays, respectively. Relative expressions of ACTA2-AS1, PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. ACTA2-AS1 expression was downregulated in CRC. Overexpressed ACTA2-AS1 repressed the cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, increased cleaved caspase-3 level yet decreased PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. ACTA2-AS1 silencing, however, did oppositely. Collectively, ACTA2-AS1 inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells to effectively suppress the progression of CRC.

Abstract: Summary
In the olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory information represented by mitral/tufted cells (M/Ts) is extensively modulated by local inhibitory interneurons before being transmitted to the olfactory cortex. While the crucial roles of cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons have been extensively studied, their precise function in the OB remains elusive. Here, we identify the synaptic connectivity of VIP interneurons onto mitral cells (MCs) and demonstrate their important role in olfactory behaviors. Optogenetic activation of VIP interneurons reduced both spontaneous and odor-evoked activity of M/Ts in awake mice. Whole-cell recordings revealed that VIP interneurons decrease MC firing through direct inhibitory synaptic connections with MCs. Furthermore, inactivation of VIP interneurons leads to increased MC firing and impaired olfactory detection and odor discrimination. Therefore, our results demonstrate that VIP interneurons control OB output and play critical roles in odor processing and olfactory behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The degree to which evolution is predictable is a fundamental question in biology. Previous attempts to predict the evolution of protein sequences have been limited to specific proteins and to small changes, such as single-residue mutations. Here, we demonstrate that by using a protein language model to predict the local evolution within protein families, we recover a dynamic “vector field” of protein evolution that we call evolutionary velocity (evo-velocity). Evo-velocity generalizes to evolution over vastly different timescales, from viral proteins evolving over years to eukaryotic proteins evolving over geologic eons, and can predict the evolutionary dynamics of proteins that were not used to develop the original model. Evo-velocity also yields new evolutionary insights by predicting strategies of viral-host immune escape, resolving conflicting theories on the evolution of serpins, and revealing a key role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of eukaryotic glycolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotype-based screening can identify small molecules that elicit a desired cellular response, but additional approaches are required to characterize their targets and mechanisms of action. Here, we show that a compound termed LCS3, which selectively impairs the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, induces oxidative stress. To identify the target that mediates this effect, we use thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and uncover the disulfide reductases GSR and TXNRD1 as targets. We confirm through enzymatic assays that LCS3 inhibits disulfide reductase activity through a reversible, uncompetitive mechanism. Further, we demonstrate that LCS3-sensitive LUAD cells are sensitive to the synergistic inhibition of glutathione and thioredoxin pathways. Lastly, a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen identifies NQO1 loss as a mechanism of LCS3 resistance. This work highlights the ability of TPP to uncover targets of small molecules identified by high-throughput screens and demonstrates the potential therapeutic utility of inhibiting disulfide reductases in LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
Even though the human reference genome assembly is continually being improved, it remains debatable whether a population-specific reference is necessary for every ethnic group. Here, we de novo assembled an individual genome (TJ1) from the Tujia population, an ethnic minority group most closely related to the Han Chinese. TJ1 provided a high-quality haplotype-resolved assembly of chromosome-scale with a scaffold N50 size >78 Mb. Compared with GRCh38 and other de novo assemblies, TJ1 improved short-read mapping, enhanced calling precision for structural variants, and detected rare and low-frequency variants. This revealed fine-scale differences between the closely related Han and Tujia populations, such as population-stratified variants of LCT and UBXN8, and improved screening for ancestry informative markers. We demonstrated that TJ1 could reduce false positives in clinical diagnosis and analyzed the PRSS1-PRSS2 locus as a test case. Our results suggest that population-specific assemblies are necessary for genetic and medical analysis, especially when closely related populations are studied. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
As sessile organisms, plants are highly sensitive to environmental stresses. In response to stresses, globally repressed translation initiation leads to stress granule (SG) formation. Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) contributes to SG formation, but a direct link between protein LLPS and stress resistance has not yet been found in plants. Here, we report that two RNA-binding proteins, RBGD2 and RBGD4, function redundantly to improve heat resistance in Arabidopsis. RBGD2 and RBGD4 undergo LLPS in vitro and condense into heat-induced SGs in vivo via tyrosine residue array (TRA). Importantly, disrupting LLPS by mutating TRA abolishes RBGD2/4 condensation in SGs and impairs their protective function against heat stress (HS). Further study found that upon HS, the RBGD2/4 interaction network expands with additional SG proteins and heat-responsive mRNA. Our work shows a mechanistic basis that underlies protein LLPS in HS response in plants and suggests manipulation of protein LLPS as a general strategy to improve plant stress resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental progression and cellular diversity are largely driven by transcription factors (TFs); yet, characterizing their loss-of-function phenotypes remains challenging and often disconnected from their underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we combine single-cell regulatory genomics with loss-of-function mutants to jointly assess both cellular and molecular phenotypes. Performing sci-ATAC-seq at eight overlapping time points during Drosophila mesoderm development could reconstruct the developmental trajectories of all major muscle types and reveal the TFs and enhancers involved. To systematically assess mutant phenotypes, we developed a single-nucleus genotyping strategy to process embryo pools of mixed genotypes. Applying this to four TF mutants could identify and quantify their characterized phenotypes de novo and discover new ones, while simultaneously revealing their regulatory input and mode of action. Our approach is a general framework to dissect the functional input of TFs in a systematic, unbiased manner, identifying both cellular and molecular phenotypes at a scale and resolution that has not been feasible before.
