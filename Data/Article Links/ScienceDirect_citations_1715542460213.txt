Abstract: Summary
The RAS-ERK/MAPK (RAS-extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway integrates growth-promoting signals to stimulate cell growth and proliferation, at least in part, through alterations in metabolic gene expression. However, examples of direct and rapid regulation of the metabolic pathways by the RAS-ERK pathway remain elusive. We find that physiological and oncogenic ERK signaling activation leads to acute metabolic flux stimulation through the de novo purine synthesis pathway, thereby increasing building block availability for RNA and DNA synthesis, which is required for cell growth and proliferation. We demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, phosphorylates the purine synthesis enzyme PFAS (phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase) at T619 in cells to stimulate de novo purine synthesis. The expression of nonphosphorylatable PFAS (T619A) decreases purine synthesis, RAS-dependent cancer cell-colony formation, and tumor growth. Thus, ERK2-mediated PFAS phosphorylation facilitates the increase in nucleic acid synthesis required for anabolic cell growth and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Emotions are distinct patterns of behavioral and physiological responses triggered by stimuli that induce different brain states. Elucidating the circuits is difficult because of challenges in interrogating emotional brain states and their complex outputs. Here, we leverage the recent discovery in mice of a neural circuit for sighing, a simple, quantifiable output of various emotions. We show that mouse confinement triggers sighing, and this “claustrophobic” sighing, but not accompanying tachypnea, requires the same medullary neuromedin B (Nmb)-expressing neurons as physiological sighing. Retrograde tracing from the Nmb neurons identified 12 forebrain centers providing presynaptic input, including hypocretin (Hcrt)-expressing lateral hypothalamic neurons. Confinement activates Hcrt neurons, and optogenetic activation induces sighing and tachypnea whereas pharmacologic inhibition suppresses both responses. The effect on sighing is mediated by HCRT directly on Nmbneurons. We propose that this HCRT-NMB neuropeptide relay circuit mediates claustrophobic sighing and that activated Hcrt neurons are a claustrophobia brain state that directly controls claustrophobic outputs.

Abstract: Summary
The organization of spatial information, including pattern completion and pattern separation processes, relies on the hippocampal circuits, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these two processes are elusive. Here, we find that loss of Vangl2, a core PCP gene, results in opposite effects on pattern completion and pattern separation processes. Mechanistically, we show that Vangl2 loss maintains young postmitotic granule cells in an immature state, providing increased cellular input for pattern separation. The genetic ablation of Vangl2 disrupts granule cell morpho-functional maturation and further prevents CaMKII and GluA1 phosphorylation, disrupting the stabilization of AMPA receptors. As a functional consequence, LTP at lateral perforant path-GC synapses is impaired, leading to defects in pattern completion behavior. In conclusion, we show that Vangl2 exerts a bimodal regulation on young and mature GCs, and its disruption leads to an imbalance in hippocampus-dependent pattern completion and separation processes.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) toxicity is hypothesized to play a seminal role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how Aβ causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of Aβ-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aβ-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aβ toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors. Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures. We propose that the APP cytosolic domain plays an essential role in Aβ-induced synaptic damage in the injury pathway mediated by localized caspase activation.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian precerebellar pontine nucleus (PN) has a main role in relaying cortical information to the cerebellum. The molecular determinants establishing ordered connectivity patterns between cortical afferents and precerebellar neurons are largely unknown. We show that expression of Hox5 transcription factors is induced in specific subsets of postmitotic PN neurons at migration onset. Hox5 induction is achieved by response to retinoic acid signaling, resulting in Jmjd3-dependent derepression of Polycomb chromatin and 3D conformational changes. Hoxa5 drives neurons to settle posteriorly in the PN, where they are monosynaptically targeted by cortical neuron subsets mainly carrying limb somatosensation. Furthermore, Hoxa5 postmigratory ectopic expression in PN neurons is sufficient to attract cortical somatosensory inputs regardless of position and avoid visual afferents. Transcriptome analysis further suggests that Hoxa5 is involved in circuit formation. Thus, Hoxa5 coordinates postmitotic specification, migration, settling position, and sub-circuit assembly of PN neuron subsets in the cortico-cerebellar pathway.

Abstract: Summary
LSD1 (lysine specific demethylase; also known as KDM1A), the first histone demethylase discovered, regulates cell-fate determination and is overexpressed in multiple cancers. LSD1 demethylates histone H3 Lys4, an epigenetic mark for active genes, but requires the CoREST repressor to act on nucleosome substrates. To understand how an accessory subunit (CoREST) enables a chromatin enzyme (LSD1) to function on a nucleosome and not just histones, we have determined the crystal structure of the LSD1/CoREST complex bound to a 191-bp nucleosome. We find that the LSD1 catalytic domain binds extranucleosomal DNA and is unexpectedly positioned 100 Å away from the nucleosome core. CoREST makes critical contacts with both histone and DNA components of the nucleosome, explaining its essential function in demethylating nucleosome substrates. Our studies also show that the LSD1(K661A) frequently used as a catalytically inactive mutant in vivo (based on in vitro peptide studies) actually retains substantial H3K4 demethylase activity on nucleosome substrates.

Abstract: Summary
During collective migration of epithelial cells, the migration direction is aligned over a tissue-scale expanse. Although the collective cell migration is known to be directed by mechanical forces transmitted via cell-cell junctions, it remains elusive how the intercellular force transmission is coordinated with intracellular biochemical signaling to achieve collective movements. Here, we show that intercellular coupling of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated mechanochemical feedback yields long-distance transmission of guidance cues. Mechanical stretch activates ERK through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, and ERK activation triggers cell contraction. The contraction of the activated cell pulls neighboring cells, evoking another round of ERK activation and contraction in the neighbors. Furthermore, anisotropic contraction based on front-rear polarization guarantees unidirectional propagation of ERK activation, and in turn, the ERK activation waves direct multicellular alignment of the polarity, leading to long-range ordered migration. Our findings reveal that mechanical forces mediate intercellular signaling underlying sustained transmission of guidance cues for collective cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the development of second-generation antiandrogens, acquired resistance to hormone therapy remains a major challenge in treating advanced prostate cancer. We find that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote antiandrogen resistance in mouse models and in prostate organoid cultures. We identify neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in CAF supernatant, which promotes resistance in tumor cells through activation of HER3. Pharmacological blockade of the NRG1/HER3 axis using clinical-grade blocking antibodies re-sensitizes tumors to hormone deprivation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with increased tumor NRG1 activity have an inferior response to second-generation antiandrogen therapy. This work reveals a paracrine mechanism of antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer amenable to clinical testing using available targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The surge in fructose consumption is a major factor behind the rapid rise of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in modern society. Through flux and genetic analyses, we demonstrate that fructose is catabolized at a much higher rate than glucose, and triose kinase (TK) couples fructolysis with lipogenesis metabolically and transcriptionally. In the absence of TK, fructose oxidation is accelerated through the activation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and serine biosynthesis, accompanied by increased oxidative stress and fructose aversion. TK is also required by the endogenous fructolysis pathway to drive lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride accumulation under high-fat diet and leptin-deficient conditions. Intriguingly, a nonsynonymous TK allele (rs2260655_A) segregated during human migration out of Africa behaves as TK null for its inability to rescue fructose toxicity and increase hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Therefore, we posit TK as a metabolic switch controlling the lipogenic potential of fructose and its dietary tolerance.

Abstract: Scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) can assist tissue remodeling and repair following injury. The ECM is a complex biomaterial composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, secreted by cells. The ECM contains fundamental biological cues that modulate cell behavior and serves as a structural scaffold for cell adhesion and growth. For clinical applications, where immune rejection is a constraint, ECM can be processed using decellularization methods intended to remove cells and donor antigens from tissue or organs, while preserving native biological cues essential for cell growth and differentiation. Recent studies show bioengineered organs composed by a combination of a diversity of materials and stem cells as a possibility of new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases that affect different tissues and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, the methodologies currently described for brain decellularization involve the use of several chemical reagents with many steps that ultimately limit the process of organ or tissue recellularization. Here, we describe for the first time a fast and straightforward method for complete decellularization of mice brain by the combination of rapid freezing and thawing following the use of only one detergent (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Our data show that using the protocol we describe here, the brain was entirely decellularized, while still maintaining ECM components that are essential for cell survival on the scaffold. Our results also show the cell-loading of the decellularized brain matrix with Neuro2a cells, which were identified by immunohistochemistry in their undifferentiated form. We conclude that this novel and simple method for brain decellularization can be used as a scaffold for cell-loading.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) lack some cellular populations found in the native organ, including vasculature. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we have identified a population of endothelial cells (ECs) present early in HIO differentiation that declines over time in culture. Here, we developed a method to expand and maintain this endogenous population of ECs within HIOs (vHIOs). Given that ECs possess organ-specific gene expression, morphology, and function, we used bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq to interrogate the developing human intestine, lung, and kidney in order to identify organ-enriched EC gene signatures. By comparing these gene signatures and validated markers to HIO ECs, we find that HIO ECs grown in vitro share the highest similarity with native intestinal ECs relative to kidney and lung. Together, these data demonstrate that HIOs can co-differentiate a native EC population that is properly patterned with an intestine-specific EC transcriptional signature in vitro.

Abstract: Carboxyl-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) are transcription regulators that control gene expression in multiple cellular processes. Our recent findings indicated that overexpression of CtBP2 caused the repression of multiple bone development and differentiation genes, resulting in atrophic nonunion. Therefore, disrupting the CtBP2-associated transcriptional complex with small molecules may be an effective strategy to prevent nonunion. In the present study, we developed an in vitro screening system in yeast cells to identify small molecules capable of disrupting the CtBP2-p300 interaction. Herein, we focus our studies on revealing the in vitro and in vivo effects of a small molecule NSM00158, which showed the strongest inhibition of the CtBP2-p300 interaction in vitro. Our results indicated that NSM00158 could specifically disrupt CtBP2 function and cause the disassociation of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 complex. The impairment of this complex led to failed binding of Runx2 to its downstream targets, causing their upregulation. Using a mouse fracture model, we evaluated the in vivo effect of NSM00158 on preventing nonunion. Consistent with the in vitro results, the NSM00158 treatment resulted in the upregulation of Runx2 downstream targets. Importantly, we found that the administration of NSM00158 could prevent the occurrence of nonunion. Our results suggest that NSM00158 represents a new potential compound to prevent the occurrence of nonunion by disrupting CtBP2 function and impairing the assembly of the CtBP2-p300-Runx2 transcriptional complex.

Abstract: Summary
Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase, plays oncogenic roles in various cancers, presenting an opportunity for the development of effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report two potent small-molecule FTO inhibitors that exhibit strong anti-tumor effects in multiple types of cancers. We show that genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of FTO dramatically attenuate leukemia stem/initiating cell self-renewal and reprogram immune response by suppressing expression of immune checkpoint genes, especially LILRB4. FTO inhibition sensitizes leukemia cells to T cell cytotoxicity and overcomes hypomethylating agent-induced immune evasion. Our study demonstrates that FTO plays critical roles in cancer stem cell self-renewal and immune evasion and highlights the broad potential of targeting FTO for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-angiogenic treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGFR2 signaling has shown limited efficacy in lung cancer patients. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of VEGFR2 in tumor cells, expressed in ∼20% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, leads to a pro-invasive phenotype. Drug-induced inhibition of tumor VEGFR2 interferes with the formation of the EphA2/VEGFR2 heterocomplex, thereby allowing RSK to interact with Serine 897 of EphA2. Inhibition of RSK decreases phosphorylation of Serine 897 EphA2. Selective genetic modeling of Serine 897 of EphA2 or inhibition of EphA2 abrogates the formation of metastases in vivo upon VEGFR2 inhibition. In summary, these findings demonstrate that VEGFR2-targeted therapy conditions VEGFR2-positive NSCLC to Serine 897 EphA2-dependent aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. These data shed light on the molecular mechanisms explaining the limited efficacy of VEGFR2-targeted anti-angiogenic treatment in lung cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Sharing data across research groups is an essential driver of biomedical research. While interactive query-answering systems for biomedical databases aim to facilitate the sharing of aggregate insights without divulging sensitive individual-level data, query answers can still leak private information about the individuals in the database. Here, we draw upon recent advances in differential privacy to introduce query-answering mechanisms that provably maximize the utility (e.g., accuracy) of the system while achieving formal privacy guarantees. We demonstrate our accuracy improvement over existing approaches for a range of use cases, including cohort discovery, variant lookup, and association testing. Our new theoretical results extend the proof of optimality of the underlying mechanism, previously known only for count queries with symmetric utility functions, to more general utility functions needed for key biomedical research workflows. Our work presents a path toward interactive biomedical databases that achieve the optimal privacy-utility trade-offs permitted by the theory of differential privacy.

Abstract: Summary
Triggering apoptosis remains an efficient strategy to treat cancer. However, apoptosis is no longer a final destination since cancer cells can undergo partial apoptosis without dying. Recent evidence shows that partial mitochondrial permeabilization and non-lethal caspase activation occur under certain circumstances, although it remains unclear how failed apoptosis affects cancer cells. Using a cancer cell model to trigger non-lethal caspase activation, we find that melanoma cancer cells undergoing failed apoptosis have a particular transcriptomic signature associated with focal adhesions, transendothelial migration, and modifications of the actin cytoskeleton. In line with this, cancer cells surviving apoptosis gain migration and invasion properties in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that failed apoptosis-associated gain in invasiveness is regulated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, whereas its RNA sequencing signature is found in metastatic melanoma. These findings advance our understanding of how cell death can both cure and promote cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The core components of the nuclear RNA export pathway are thought to be required for export of virtually all polyadenylated RNAs. Here, we depleted different proteins that act in nuclear export in human cells and quantified the transcriptome-wide consequences on RNA localization. Different genes exhibited substantially variable sensitivities, with depletion of NXF1 and TREX components causing some transcripts to become strongly retained in the nucleus while others were not affected. Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts. Using massively parallel reporter assays, we identified short sequence elements that render transcripts dependent on NXF1 for their export and identified synergistic effects of splicing and NXF1. These results revise the current model of how nuclear export shapes the distribution of RNA within human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity is essential for the architecture and function of numerous epithelial tissues. Here, we show that apical restriction of planar cell polarity (PCP) components is necessary for the maintenance of epithelial integrity. Using the mammalian pancreas as a model, we find that components of the core PCP pathway, such as the transmembrane protein Van Gogh-like (VANGL), become apically restricted over a period of several days. Expansion of VANGL localization to the basolateral membranes of progenitors leads to their death and disruption of the epithelial integrity. VANGL basolateral expansion does not affect apico-basal polarity but acts in the cells where Vangl is mislocalized by reducing Dishevelled and its downstream target ROCK. This reduction in ROCK activity culminates in progenitor cell egression, death, and eventually pancreatic hypoplasia. Thus, precise spatiotemporal modulation of VANGL-dependent PCP signaling is crucial for proper pancreatic morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Sister-chromatid cohesion describes the orderly association of newly replicated DNA molecules behind replication forks. It plays an essential role in the maintenance and faithful transmission of genetic information. Cohesion is created by DNA topological links and proteinaceous bridges, whose formation and deposition could be potentially affected by many processes. Current knowledge on cohesion has been mainly gained by fluorescence microscopy observation. However, the resolution limit of microscopy and the restricted number of genomic positions that can be simultaneously visualized considerably hampered progress. Here, we present a high-throughput methodology to monitor sister-chromatid contacts (Hi-SC2). Using the multi-chromosomal Vibrio cholerae bacterium as a model, we show that Hi-SC2 permits to monitor local variations in sister-chromatid cohesion at a high resolution over a whole genome.

Abstract: Summary
Pneumonias caused by influenza A virus (IAV) co- and secondary bacterial infections are characterized by their severity and high mortality rate. Previously, we have shown that bacterial pore-forming toxin (PFT)-mediated necroptosis is a key driver of acute lung injury during bacterial pneumonia. Here, we evaluate the impact of IAV on PFT-induced acute lung injury during co- and secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) infection. We observe that IAV synergistically sensitizes lung epithelial cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis in vitro and in murine models of Spn co-infection and secondary infection. Pharmacoelogical induction of oxidative stress without virus sensitizes cells for PFT-mediated necroptosis. Antioxidant treatment or inhibition of necroptosis reduces disease severity during secondary bacterial infection. Our results advance our understanding on the molecular basis of co- and secondary bacterial infection to influenza and identify necroptosis inhibition and antioxidant therapy as potential intervention strategies.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of misfolded proteins is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders, but it remains poorly defined how this accumulation causes cytotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the Cdc48/p97 segregase machinery drives the clearance of ubiquitinated model misfolded protein Huntingtin (Htt103QP) and limits its aggregation. Nuclear ubiquitin ligase San1 acts upstream of Cdc48 to ubiquitinate Htt103QP. Unexpectedly, deletion of SAN1 and/or its cytosolic counterpart UBR1 rescues the toxicity associated with Cdc48 deficiency, suggesting that ubiquitin depletion, rather than compromised proteolysis of misfolded proteins, causes the growth defect in cells with Cdc48 deficiency. Indeed, Cdc48 deficiency leads to elevated protein ubiquitination levels and decreased free ubiquitin, which depends on San1/Ubr1. Furthermore, enhancing free ubiquitin levels rescues the toxicity in various Cdc48 pathway mutants and restores normal turnover of a known Cdc48-independent substrate. Our work highlights a previously unappreciated function for Cdc48 in ensuring the regeneration of monoubiquitin that is critical for normal cellular function.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is genetically heterogeneous with monogenic and complex polygenic forms. Using exome and targeted sequencing in 2,737 severely obese cases and 6,704 controls, we identified three genes (PHIP, DGKI, and ZMYM4) with an excess burden of very rare predicted deleterious variants in cases. In cells, we found that nuclear PHIP (pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein) directly enhances transcription of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neuropeptide that suppresses appetite. Obesity-associated PHIP variants repressed POMC transcription. Our demonstration that PHIP is involved in human energy homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of central melanocortin signaling has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications for patients with obesity and developmental delay. Additionally, we found an excess burden of predicted deleterious variants involving genes nearest to loci from obesity genome-wide association studies. Genes and gene sets influencing obesity with variable penetrance provide compelling evidence for a continuum of causality in the genetic architecture of obesity, and explain some of its missing heritability.

Abstract: Summary
The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal microbial weapon that injects a large needle-like structure carrying toxic effectors into recipient cells through physical penetration. How recipients respond to physical force and effectors remains elusive. Here, we use a series of effector mutants of Vibrio cholerae to determine how T6SS elicits response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. We show that TseL, but no other effectors or physical puncture, triggers the tit-for-tat response of P. aeruginosa H1-T6SS. Although E. coli is sensitive to all periplasmically expressed effectors, P. aeruginosa is most sensitive to TseL alone. We identify a number of stress response pathways that confer protection against TseL. Physical puncture of T6SS has a moderate inhibitory effect only on envelope-impaired tolB and rseA mutants. Our data reveal that recipient cells primarily respond to effector toxicity but not to physical contact, and they rely on the stress response for immunity-independent protection.

Abstract: Summary
Functional connectivity (FC) calculated from task fMRI data better reveals brain-phenotype relationships than rest-based FC, but how tasks have this effect is unknown. In over 700 individuals performing seven tasks, we use psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and predictive modeling analyses to demonstrate that task-induced changes in FC successfully predict phenotype, and these changes are not simply driven by task activation. Activation, however, is useful for prediction only if the in-scanner task is related to the predicted phenotype. To further characterize these predictive FC changes, we develop and apply an inter-subject PPI analysis. We find that moderate, but not high, task-induced consistency of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across individuals is useful for prediction. Together, these findings demonstrate that in-scanner tasks have distributed, phenotypically relevant effects on brain functional organization, and they offer a framework to leverage both task activation and FC to reveal the neural bases of complex human traits, symptoms, and behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocytes, replenished throughout life by melanocyte stem cells (MSCs), play a critical role in pigmentation and melanoma. Here, we reveal a function for the metastasis-associated phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL3) in MSC regeneration. We show that PRL3 binds to the RNA helicase DDX21, thereby restricting productive transcription by RNAPII at master transcription factor (MITF)-regulated endolysosomal vesicle genes. In zebrafish, this mechanism controls premature melanoblast expansion and differentiation from MSCs. In melanoma patients, restricted transcription of this endolysosomal vesicle pathway is a hallmark of PRL3-high melanomas. Our work presents the conceptual advance that PRL3-mediated control of transcriptional elongation is a differentiation checkpoint mechanism for activated MSCs and has clinical relevance for the activity of PRL3 in regenerating tissue and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Ependymoma is a heterogeneous entity of central nervous system tumors with well-established molecular groups. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze ependymomas across molecular groups and anatomic locations to investigate their intratumoral heterogeneity and developmental origins. Ependymomas are composed of a cellular hierarchy initiating from undifferentiated populations, which undergo impaired differentiation toward three lineages of neuronal-glial fate specification. While prognostically favorable groups of ependymoma predominantly harbor differentiated cells, aggressive groups are enriched for undifferentiated cell populations. The delineated transcriptomic signatures correlate with patient survival and define molecular dependencies for targeted treatment approaches. Taken together, our analyses reveal a developmental hierarchy underlying ependymomas relevant to biological and clinical behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics halt the growth of bacteria by targeting core, essential physiology that is required for life on standard microbiological media. Many more biochemical and virulence processes, however, are required for bacteria to cause infection in a host. Indeed, chemical inhibitors of the latter processes are overlooked using conventional antibiotic drug discovery approaches. Here, we use human blood serum as an alternative growth medium to explore new targets and compounds. High-throughput screening of genetic and chemical libraries identified compounds targeting biological activities required by Klebsiella pneumoniae to grow in serum, such as nucleobase biosynthesis and iron acquisition, and showed that serum can chemically transform compounds to reveal cryptic antibacterial activity. One of these compounds, ruthenium red, was effective in a rat bloodstream infection model. Our data demonstrate that human serum is an effective tool to find new chemical matter to address the current antibiotic resistance crisis.

Abstract: Summary
Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that deaminate adenosine to inosine. Although many RNA editing sites are known, few trans regulators have been identified. We perform BioID followed by mass spectrometry to identify trans regulators of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in HeLa and M17 neuroblastoma cells. We identify known and novel ADAR-interacting proteins. Using ENCODE data, we validate and characterize a subset of the novel interactors as global or site-specific RNA editing regulators. Our set of novel trans regulators includes all four members of the DZF-domain-containing family of proteins: ILF3, ILF2, STRBP, and ZFR. We show that these proteins interact with each ADAR and modulate RNA editing levels. We find ILF3 is a broadly influential negative regulator of editing. This work demonstrates the broad roles that RNA binding proteins play in regulating editing levels, and establishes DZF-domain-containing proteins as a group of highly influential RNA editing regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways are crucial for adjusting growth, reproduction, and cell maintenance in response to altered environmental conditions or energy balance. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the signaling networks and mechanistic changes that coordinate physiological changes across tissues. We found that loss of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor significantly slows Caenorhabditis elegans’ reproductive decline, an early hallmark of aging in many animals. Our results indicate that CREB acts downstream of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) Sma/Mab pathway in the hypodermis to control reproductive aging, and that it does so by regulating a Hedgehog-related signaling factor, WRT-10. Overexpression of hypodermal wrt-10 is sufficient to delay reproductive decline and oocyte quality deterioration, potentially acting via Patched-related receptors in the germline. This TGF-β-CREB-Hedgehog signaling axis allows a key metabolic tissue to communicate with the reproductive system to regulate oocyte quality and the rate of reproductive decline.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes are organized as individual complexes and supercomplexes, whose biogenesis remains to be fully understood. To disclose the role of the human Hypoxia Inducible Gene Domain family proteins HIGD1A and HIGD2A in these processes, we generate and characterize HIGD-knockout (KO) cell lines. We show that HIGD2A controls and coordinates the modular assembly of isolated and supercomplexed complex IV (CIV) by acting on the COX3 assembly module. In contrast, HIGD1A regulates CIII and CIII-containing supercomplex biogenesis by supporting the incorporation of UQCRFS1. HIGD1A also clusters with COX4-1 and COX5A CIV subunits and, when overexpressed, suppresses the CIV biogenesis defect of HIGD2A-KO cells. We conclude that HIGD1A and HIGD2A have both independent and overlapping functions in the biogenesis of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Our data illuminate the existence of multiple pathways to assemble these structures by dynamic HIGD-mediated CIV biogenesis, potentially to adapt to changing environmental and nutritional conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Structural and functional studies of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) as a transmembrane protein have long been complicated by challenges associated with inherent flexibility of the molecule and the membrane-embedded hydrophobic regions. Here, we present approaches for incorporating full-length, wild-type HIV-1 Env, as well as C-terminally truncated and stabilized versions, into lipid assemblies, providing a modular platform for Env structural studies by single particle electron microscopy. We reconstitute a full-length Env clone into a nanodisc, complex it with a membrane-proximal external region (MPER) targeting antibody 10E8, and structurally define the full quaternary epitope of 10E8 consisting of lipid, MPER, and ectodomain contacts. By aligning this and other Env-MPER antibody complex reconstructions with the lipid bilayer, we observe evidence of Env tilting as part of the neutralization mechanism for MPER-targeting antibodies. We also adapt the platform toward vaccine design purposes by introducing stabilizing mutations that allow purification of unliganded Env with a peptidisc scaffold.

Abstract: Summary
In response to estrogens, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a critical regulator of homeostasis, is degraded through the 26S proteasome. However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives. RSK2 loss enhances DNA damage, which may account for the elevated breast cancer risk with the use of exogenous estrogens. These findings implicate RSK2 as a critical component for the preservation of estrogen homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of primary neuronal inputs inevitably strikes every neural circuit. The deafferented circuit could propagate, amplify, or mitigate input loss, thus affecting the circuit’s output. How the deafferented circuit contributes to the effect on the output is poorly understood because of lack of control over loss of and access to circuit elements. Here, we control the timing and degree of rod photoreceptor ablation in mature mouse retina and uncover compensation. Following loss of half of the rods, rod bipolar cells mitigate the loss by preserving voltage output. Such mitigation allows partial recovery of ganglion cell responses. We conclude that rod death is compensated for in the circuit because ganglion cell responses to stimulation of half of the rods in an unperturbed circuit are weaker than responses after death of half of the rods. The dominant mechanism of such compensation includes homeostatic regulation of inhibition to balance the loss of excitation.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular lymphomas (FLs) are slow-growing, indolent tumors containing extensive follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks and recurrent EZH2 gain-of-function mutations. Paradoxically, FLs originate from highly proliferative germinal center (GC) B cells with proliferation strictly dependent on interactions with T follicular helper cells. Herein, we show that EZH2 mutations initiate FL by attenuating GC B cell requirement for T cell help and driving slow expansion of GC centrocytes that become enmeshed with and dependent on FDCs. By impairing T cell help, mutant EZH2 prevents induction of proliferative MYC programs. Thus, EZH2 mutation fosters malignant transformation by epigenetically reprograming B cells to form an aberrant immunological niche that reflects characteristic features of human FLs, explaining how indolent tumors arise from GC B cells.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and MCL-1 to release pro-apoptotic protein BIM and reactivate cell death could potentially be an efficient strategy for the treatment of leukemia. Here, we show that a lncRNA, MORRBID, a selective transcriptional repressor of BIM, is overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is associated with poor overall survival. In both human and animal models, MORRBID hyperactivation correlates with two recurrent AML drivers, TET2 and FLT3ITD. Mice with individual mutations of Tet2 or Flt3ITD develop features of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), respectively, and combined presence results in AML. We observe increased levels of Morrbid in murine models of CMML, MPN, and AML. Functionally, loss of Morrbid in these models induces increased expression of Bim and cell death in immature and mature myeloid cells, which results in reduced infiltration of leukemic cells in tissues and prolongs the survival of AML mice.

Abstract: Summary
The cardiac neural crest arises in the hindbrain, then migrates to the heart and contributes to critical structures, including the outflow tract septum. Chick cardiac crest ablation results in failure of this septation, phenocopying the human heart defect persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), which trunk neural crest fails to rescue. Here, we probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac crest’s unique potential. Transcriptional profiling identified cardiac-crest-specific transcription factors, with single-cell RNA sequencing revealing surprising heterogeneity, including an ectomesenchymal subpopulation within the early migrating population. Loss-of-function analyses uncovered a transcriptional subcircuit, comprised of Tgif1, Ets1, and Sox8, critical for cardiac neural crest and heart development. Importantly, ectopic expression of this subcircuit was sufficient to imbue trunk crest with the ability to rescue PTA after cardiac crest ablation. Together, our results reveal a transcriptional program sufficient to confer cardiac potential onto trunk neural crest cells, thus implicating new genes in cardiovascular birth defects.

Abstract: In response to excitation of skeletal muscle fibers, trains of action potentials induce changes in the configuration of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) anchored in the tubular membrane which opens the Ca2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The DHPR also functions as a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel that conducts L-type Ca2+ currents routinely recorded in mammalian muscle fibers, which role was debated for more than four decades. Recently, to allow a closer look into the role of DHPR Ca2+ influx in mammalian muscle, a knock-in (ki) mouse model (ncDHPR) carrying mutation N617D (adjacent to domain II selectivity filter E) in the DHPRα1S subunit abolishing Ca2+ permeation through the channel was generated [Dayal et al., 2017]. In the present study, the Mn2+ quenching technique was initially intended to be used on voltage-clamped muscle fibers from this mouse to determine whether Ca2+ influx through a pathway distinct from DHPR may occur to compensate for the absence of DHPR Ca2+ influx. Surprisingly, while N617D DHPR muscle fibers of the ki mouse do not conduct Ca2+, Mn2+ entry and subsequent quenching did occur because Mn2+ was able to permeate and produce L-type currents through N617D DHPR. N617D DHPR was also found to conduct Ba2+ and Ba2+ currents were strongly blocked by external Ca2+. Ba2+ permeation was smaller, current kinetics slower and Ca2+ block more potent than in wild-type DHPR. These results indicate that residue N617 when replaced by the negatively charged residue D is suitably located at entrance of the pore to trap external Ca2+ impeding in this way permeation. Because Ba2+ binds with lower affinity to D, Ba2+ currents occur, but with reduced amplitudes as compared to Ba2+ currents through wild-type channels. We conclude that mutations located outside the selectivity filter influence channel permeation and possibly channel gating in a fully differentiated skeletal muscle environment.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the precise function of LRRK2 remains unclear. We report an interaction between LRRK2 and VPS52, a subunit of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that identifies a function of LRRK2 in regulating membrane fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, LRRK2 further interacts with the Golgi SNAREs VAMP4 and Syntaxin-6 and acts as a scaffolding platform that stabilizes the GARP-SNAREs complex formation. Therefore, LRRK2 influences both retrograde and post-Golgi trafficking pathways in a manner dependent on its GTP binding and kinase activity. This action is exaggerated by mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease and can be blocked by kinase inhibitors. Disruption of GARP sensitizes dopamine neurons to mutant LRRK2 toxicity in C. elegans, showing that these pathways are interlinked in vivo and suggesting a link in PD.

Abstract: High-conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channels (BKCa) and store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) are belong to K+ channels superfamily and calcium channels superfamily respectively. Since BKCa potassium channels can be activated by calcium ions, we set out to examine whether SOCs are coupled with BKCa and to probe the relationship of BKCa and SOCs. First, we proved that BKCa immunoprecipitated with Orai1, and confocal microscopy showed that BKCa co-localized with Orai1. Next, we mapped that the exact binding sites locate in the 350aa-371aa fragment of the first regulatory domain associated with K+ conduction (RCK1) and the 720aa-814aa fragment in the second regulatory domain associated with K+ conduction (RCK2) via GST-pull-down assays. Then, we showed, by calcium imaging that BKCa overexpression enhanced endogenous and exogenous store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and this enhancement could be blocked by Orai1 knockdown. Finally, we proved that SOCE could enhance the activity of BKCa by patch-clamp. From these results we conclude that BKCa can form a positive feedback loop with SOCs, as the Ca2+ influx from SOCs can active BKCa, which can hyperpolarize the plasma membrane. In turn, the hyperpolarized membrane will form a higher electric potential difference and give more force, allowing Ca2+ influx via SOCs.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is pervasive in the human genome. However, the mechanisms controlling transcription at promoters and enhancers remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11), the catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, regulates transcription at these loci through its endonuclease activity. Promoters of genes require INTS11 to cleave nascent transcripts associated with paused RNAPII and induce their premature termination in the proximity of the +1 nucleosome. The turnover of RNAPII permits the subsequent recruitment of an elongation-competent RNAPII complex, leading to productive elongation. In contrast, enhancers require INTS11 catalysis not to evict paused RNAPII but rather to terminate enhancer RNA transcription beyond the +1 nucleosome. These findings are supported by the differential occupancy of negative elongation factor (NELF), SPT5, and tyrosine-1-phosphorylated RNAPII. This study elucidates the role of Integrator in mediating transcriptional elongation at human promoters through the endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent transcripts and the dynamic turnover of RNAPII.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that deficient immune modulation and microbial infections underline neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we show that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) SRBC-48, which belongs to the class BC serpentine receptors, has a protective role in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrite degeneration caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Our results indicate that SRBC-48 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in AWC neurons to protect against infection-associated dendrite degeneration. The absence of SRBC-48 results in a reduced lifespan caused by a pathogen infection early in life that induces dendrite degeneration. The decreased longevity in animals deficient in SRBC-48 is due to uncontrolled activation of immune genes, particularly those regulated by the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 that is part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor homolog DAF-2. These results reveal how an infection early in life can not only induce dendrite degeneration but also reduce lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Repair of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) by DNA-dependent proteases has emerged as an essential genome maintenance mechanism required for cellular viability and tumor suppression. However, how proteolysis is restricted to the crosslinked protein while leaving surrounding chromatin proteins unharmed has remained unknown. Using defined DPC model substrates, we show that the DPC protease SPRTN displays strict DNA structure-specific activity. Strikingly, SPRTN cleaves DPCs at or in direct proximity to disruptions within double-stranded DNA. In contrast, proteins crosslinked to intact double- or single-stranded DNA are not cleaved by SPRTN. NMR spectroscopy data suggest that specificity is not merely affinity-driven but achieved through a flexible bipartite strategy based on two DNA binding interfaces recognizing distinct structural features. This couples DNA context to activation of the enzyme, tightly confining SPRTN’s action to biologically relevant scenarios.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin-D-binding protein (DBP) or group-specific component of serum (GC-globulin) carries vitamin D metabolites from the circulation to target tissues. DBP is highly localized to the liver and pancreatic α cells. Although DBP serum levels, gene polymorphisms, and autoantigens have all been associated with diabetes risk, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that DBP regulates α cell morphology, α cell function, and glucagon secretion. Deletion of DBP leads to smaller and hyperplastic α cells, altered Na+ channel conductance, impaired α cell activation by low glucose, and reduced rates of glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, this involves reversible changes in islet microfilament abundance and density, as well as changes in glucagon granule distribution. Defects are also seen in β cell and δ cell function. Immunostaining of human pancreata reveals generalized loss of DBP expression as a feature of late-onset and long-standing, but not early-onset, type 1 diabetes. Thus, DBP regulates α cell phenotype, with implications for diabetes pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity at brain inhibitory synapses remain poorly characterized. Increased postsynaptic clustering of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) rapidly strengthens inhibition during inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP). However, it is unclear how synaptic GABAAR clustering is maintained to sustain iLTP. Here, we identify a role for miR376c in regulating the translation of mRNAs encoding the synaptic α1 and γ2 GABAAR subunits, GABRA1 and GABRG2, respectively. Following iLTP induction, transcriptional repression of miR376c is induced through a calcineurin-NFAT-HDAC signaling pathway and promotes increased translation and clustering of synaptic GABAARs. This pathway is essential for the long-term expression of iLTP and is blocked by miR376c overexpression, specifically impairing inhibitory synaptic strength. Finally, we show that local de novo synthesis of synaptic GABAARs occurs exclusively in dendrites and in a miR376c-dependent manner following iLTP. Together, this work describes a local post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates inhibitory synaptic plasticity via miRNA control of dendritic protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
After fertilization, sperm and oocyte nuclei are rapidly remodeled to form swollen pronuclei (PN) in mammalian zygotes, and the proper formation and function of PN are key to producing totipotent zygotes. However, how mature PN are formed has been unclear. We find that filamentous actin (F-actin) assembles in the PN of mouse zygotes and is required for fully functional PN. The perturbation of nuclear actin dynamics in zygotes results in the misregulation of genes related to genome integrity and abnormal development of mouse embryos. We show that nuclear F-actin ensures DNA damage repair, thus preventing the activation of a zygotic checkpoint. Furthermore, optogenetic control of cofilin nuclear localization reveals the dynamically regulated F-actin nucleoskeleton in zygotes, and its timely disassembly is needed for developmental progression. Nuclear F-actin is a hallmark of totipotent zygotic PN, and the temporal regulation of its polymerized state is necessary for normal embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Excitatory synapses of neurons are located on dendritic spines. Spine maturation is essential for the stability of synapses and memory consolidation, and overproduction of the immature filopodia is associated with brain disorders. The structure and function of synapses can be modulated by protein post-translational modification (PTM). Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus. Here we find that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT8 is present at neuronal synapses and its expression is upregulated in the hippocampus when dendritic spine maturation occurs. Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses. Mechanistically, PRMT8 promotes dendritic spine morphology through methylation of the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1 and suppression of the Rac1-PAK1 signaling pathway to control synaptic actin dynamics. Our findings unravel arginine methylation as a crucial regulatory mechanism for actin cytoskeleton during synapse development.

Abstract: Summary
Stresses associated with disease may pathologically remodel the proteome by both increasing interaction strength and altering interaction partners, resulting in proteome-wide connectivity dysfunctions. Chaperones play an important role in these alterations, but how these changes are executed remains largely unknown. Our study unveils a specific N-glycosylation pattern used by a chaperone, Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), to alter its conformational fitness and stabilize a state most permissive for stable interactions with proteins at the plasma membrane. This “protein assembly mutation’ remodels protein networks and properties of the cell. We show in cells, human specimens, and mouse xenografts that proteome connectivity is restorable by inhibition of the N-glycosylated GRP94 variant. In summary, we provide biochemical evidence for stressor-induced chaperone-mediated protein mis-assemblies and demonstrate how these alterations are actionable in disease.

Abstract: Summary
The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and coronavirus spike (S) protein mediate virus entry. HA and S proteins are heavily glycosylated, making them potential targets for carbohydrate binding agents such as lectins. Here, we show that the lectin FRIL, isolated from hyacinth beans (Lablab purpureus), has anti-influenza and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations, and intranasal administration of FRIL is protective against lethal H1N1 infection in mice. FRIL binds preferentially to complex-type N-glycans and neutralizes viruses that possess complex-type N-glycans on their envelopes. As a homotetramer, FRIL is capable of aggregating influenza particles through multivalent binding and trapping influenza virions in cytoplasmic late endosomes, preventing their nuclear entry. Remarkably, FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells. These findings suggest a potential application of FRIL for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Many organs are formed through folding of an epithelium. This change in shape is usually attributed to tissue heterogeneities, for example, local apical contraction. In contrast, compressive stresses have been proposed to fold a homogeneous epithelium by buckling. While buckling is an appealing mechanism, demonstrating that it underlies folding requires measurement of the stress field and the material properties of the tissue, which are currently inaccessible in vivo. Here, we show that monolayers of identical cells proliferating on the inner surface of elastic spherical shells can spontaneously fold. By measuring the elastic deformation of the shell, we infer the forces acting within the monolayer and its elastic modulus. Using analytical and numerical theories linking forces to shape, we find that buckling quantitatively accounts for the shape changes of our monolayers. Our study shows that forces arising from epithelial growth in three-dimensional confinement are sufficient to drive folding by buckling.

Abstract: Summary
How γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a master template for microtubule nucleation, is spatially and temporally regulated for the assembly of new microtubule arrays remains unclear. Here, we report that an evolutionarily conserved microprotein, Mozart1 (Mzt1), regulates subcellular targeting and microtubule formation activity of γ-TuRC at different cell cycle stages. Crystal structures of protein complexes demonstrate that Mzt1 promiscuously interacts with the N-terminal domains of multiple γ-tubulin complex protein subunits in γ-TuRC via an intercalative binding mode. Genetic- and microscopy-based analyses show that promiscuous binding of Mzt1 in γ-TuRC controls specific subcellular localization of γ-TuRC to modulate microtubule nucleation and stabilization in fission yeast. Moreover, we find Mzt1-independent targeting of γ-TuRC to be crucial for mitotic spindle assembly, demonstrating the cell-cycle-dependent regulation and function of γ-TuRC. Our findings reveal a microprotein-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying microtubule cytoskeleton formation, whereby Mzt1 binding promiscuity confers localization specificity on the multi-protein complex γ-TuRC.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of Hippo tumor-suppressor activity and hyperactivation of YAP are commonly observed in cancers. Inactivating mutations of Hippo kinases MST1/2 are uncommon, and it remains unclear how their activity is turned off during tumorigenesis. We identified STRN3 as an essential regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that recruits MST1/2 and promotes its dephosphorylation, which results in YAP activation. We also identified STRN3 upregulation in gastric cancer correlated with YAP activation and poor prognosis. Based on this mechanistic understanding and aided by structure-guided medicinal chemistry, we developed a highly selective peptide inhibitor, STRN3-derived Hippo-activating peptide, or SHAP, which disrupts the STRN3-PP2Aa interaction and reactivates the Hippo tumor suppressor, inhibits YAP activation, and has antitumor effects in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Data-driven analyses are increasingly valued in modern medicine. We integrate quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics from over 1,000 post-mortem brains from six cohorts representing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), asymptomatic AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and control patients from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership – Alzheimer’s Disease consortium. We define robust co-expression trajectories related to disease progression, including early neuronal, microglial, astrocyte, and immune response modules, and later mRNA splicing and mitochondrial modules. The majority of, but not all, modules are conserved at the transcriptomic level, including module C3, which is only observed in proteome networks and enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Genetic risk enriches in modules changing early in disease and indicates that AD and PSP have distinct causal biological drivers at the pathway level, despite aspects of similar pathology, including synaptic loss and glial inflammatory changes. The conserved, high-confidence proteomic changes enriched in genetic risk represent targets for drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can reprogram a somatic nucleus to a totipotent state. However, the re-organization of 3D chromatin structure in this process remains poorly understood. Using low-input Hi-C, we revealed that, during SCNT, the transferred nucleus first enters a mitotic-like state (premature chromatin condensation). Unlike fertilized embryos, SCNT embryos show stronger topologically associating domains (TADs) at the 1-cell stage. TADs become weaker at the 2-cell stage, followed by gradual consolidation. Compartments A/B are markedly weak in 1-cell SCNT embryos and become increasingly strengthened afterward. By the 8-cell stage, somatic chromatin architecture is largely reset to embryonic patterns. Unexpectedly, we found cohesin represses minor zygotic genome activation (ZGA) genes (2-cell-specific genes) in pluripotent and differentiated cells, and pre-depleting cohesin in donor cells facilitates minor ZGA and SCNT. These data reveal multi-step reprogramming of 3D chromatin architecture during SCNT and support dual roles of cohesin in TAD formation and minor ZGA repression.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets by Ago2 crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods has provided major insights into the biology of this important class of non-coding RNAs. However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers. This method and the datasets we have generated will facilitate the characterization of miRNA-mRNA networks in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in many neurological disorders. Injury to the peripheral sensory nerves leads to a neuroinflammatory response in the somatosensory pathway, from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to the spinal cord, contributing to neuropathic pain. How the immune reaction is initiated peripherally and propagated to the spinal cord remains less clear. Here, we find that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), highly expressed in Schwann cells, mediates neuroinflammatory response through the activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and inducing interleukin 6 (IL-6) in sensory neurons. Cntf deficiency attenuates neuroinflammation in DRG and the spinal cord with alleviated pain post-injury. Recombinant CNTF applied to the sensory nerves recapitulates neuroinflammation in the DRG and spinal cord, with consequent pain development. We delineate the CNTF-STAT3-IL-6 axis in mediating the onset and progression of the inflammatory cascade from the periphery to the spinal cord with therapeutic implications for neuropathic pain.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore the role of IL-6-miR-210 in the regulation of Tregs function and atrial fibrosis in atrial fibrillation (AF). The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 in AF patients were detected by using ELISA. Proportions of Treg cells were detected by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis in AF patients. The expression of Foxp3, α-SMA, collagen I and collagen III were determined by western blot. The atrial mechanocytes were authenticated by vimentin immunostaining. The expression of miR-210 was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). TargetScan was used to predict potential targets of miR-210. The cardiomyocyte transverse sections in AF model group were observed by H&E staining. The myocardial filaments were observed by masson staining. The level of IL-6 was highly increased while the level of IL-10 (Tregs) was significantly decreased in AF patients as compared to normal control subjects, and IL-6 suppressed Tregs function and promoted the expression of α-SMA, collagen I and collagen III. Furthermore, miR-210 regulated Tregs function by targeting Foxp3, and IL-6 promoted expression of miR-210 via regulating hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). IL-6-miR-210 suppresses regulatory T cell function and promotes atrial fibrosis by targeting Foxp3.

Abstract: Summary
The PD-1 pathway regulates dysfunctional T cells in chronic infection and cancer, but the role of this pathway during acute infection remains less clear. Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8+ T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of CD8+ T cell signals that promotes CD8+ T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 continues to fine-tune CD8+ T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in patients.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome is the main proteolytic system for targeted protein degradation in the cell and is fine-tuned according to cellular needs. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction and concomitant metabolic reprogramming of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reduce the assembly and activity of the 26S proteasome. Both mitochondrial mutations in respiratory complex I and treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin impair 26S proteasome activity. Defective 26S assembly is reversible and can be overcome by supplementation of aspartate or pyruvate. This metabolic regulation of 26S activity involves specific regulation of proteasome assembly factors via the mTORC1 pathway. Of note, reducing 26S activity by metformin confers increased resistance toward the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which is reversible upon pyruvate supplementation. Our study uncovers unexpected consequences of defective mitochondrial metabolism for proteasomal protein degradation in the cell, which has important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that exhibits two alternative life cycles: latency and lytic reactivation. During lytic reactivation, host innate immune responses are activated to restrict viral replication. Here, we report that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is required for optimal KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. Knockdown of ADAR1 in KSHV latently infected cells inhibits viral gene transcription and viral replication during KSHV lytic reactivation. ADAR1 deficiency also significantly increases type I interferon production during KSHV reactivation. This increased interferon response is dependent on activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. Depletion of ADAR1 together with either RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS reverses the increased IFNβ production and rescues KSHV lytic replication. These data suggest that ADAR1 serves as a proviral factor for KSHV lytic reactivation and facilitates DNA virus reactivation by dampening the RLR pathway-mediated innate immune response.

Abstract: Summary
An evolutionarily conserved function of glia is to provide metabolic and structural support for neurons. To identify molecules generated by glia and with vital functions for neurons, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a screening tool, and subsequently translated the findings to mice. We found that a cargo receptor operating in the secretory pathway of glia was essential to maintain axonal integrity by regulating iron buffering. Ferritin heavy chain was identified as the critical secretory cargo, required for the protection against iron-mediated ferroptotic axonal damage. In mice, ferritin heavy chain is highly expressed by oligodendrocytes and secreted by employing an unconventional secretion pathway involving extracellular vesicles. Disrupting the release of extracellular vesicles or the expression of ferritin heavy chain in oligodendrocytes causes neuronal loss and oxidative damage in mice. Our data point to a role of oligodendrocytes in providing an antioxidant defense system to support neurons against iron-mediated cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
As we navigate in space, external landmarks and internal information guide our movement. Circuit and synaptic mechanisms that integrate these cues with head-direction (HD) signals remain, however, unclear. We identify an excitatory synaptic projection from the presubiculum (PreS) and the multisensory-associative retrosplenial cortex (RSC) to the anterodorsal thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), so far classically implied in gating sensory information flow. In vitro, projections to TRN involve AMPA/NMDA-type glutamate receptors that initiate TRN cell burst discharge and feedforward inhibition of anterior thalamic nuclei. In vivo, chemogenetic anterodorsal TRN inhibition modulates PreS/RSC-induced anterior thalamic firing dynamics, broadens the tuning of thalamic HD cells, and leads to preferential use of allo- over egocentric search strategies in the Morris water maze. TRN-dependent thalamic inhibition is thus an integral part of limbic navigational circuits wherein it coordinates external sensory and internal HD signals to regulate the choice of search strategies during spatial navigation.

Abstract: Summary
The γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) is the major microtubule nucleator in cells. The mechanism of its regulation is not understood. We purified human γTuRC and measured its nucleation properties in a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy-based real-time nucleation assay. We find that γTuRC stably caps the minus ends of microtubules that it nucleates stochastically. Nucleation is inefficient compared with microtubule elongation. The 4 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of γTuRC, combined with crosslinking mass spectrometry analysis, reveals an asymmetric conformation with only part of the complex in a “closed” conformation matching the microtubule geometry. Actin in the core of the complex, and MZT2 at the outer perimeter of the closed part of γTuRC appear to stabilize the closed conformation. The opposite side of γTuRC is in an “open,” nucleation-incompetent conformation, leading to a structural asymmetry explaining the low nucleation efficiency of purified human γTuRC. Our data suggest possible regulatory mechanisms for microtubule nucleation by γTuRC closure.

Abstract: Summary
The Bloom’s helicase ortholog, Sgs1, orchestrates the formation and disengagement of recombination intermediates to enable controlled crossing-over during meiotic and mitotic DNA repair. Whether its enzymatic activity is temporally regulated to implement formation of noncrossovers prior to the activation of crossover-nucleases is unknown. Here, we show that, akin to the Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and MutLγ-Exo1 nucleases, Sgs1 helicase function is under cell-cycle control through the actions of CDK and Cdc5 kinases. Notably, however, whereas CDK and Cdc5 unleash nuclease function during M phase, they act in concert to stimulate Sgs1 activity during S phase/prophase I. Mechanistically, CDK-mediated phosphorylation enhances the velocity and processivity of Sgs1, which stimulates DNA unwinding in vitro and joint molecule processing in vivo. Subsequent hyper-phosphorylation by Cdc5 appears to reduce the activity of Sgs1, while activating Mus81-Mms4 and MutLγ-Exo1. These findings suggest a concerted mechanism driving orderly formation of noncrossover and crossover recombinants in meiotic and mitotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasome activation leads to pyroptotic cell death, thereby eliminating the replicative niche of virulent pathogens. Although inflammasome-associated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 have an established role in T cell function, whether inflammasome activation in dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for T cell priming is not clear. Here, we find that conventional DCs (cDCs) suppress inflammasome activation to prevent pyroptotic cell death, thus preserving their ability to prime both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Transcription factors IRF8 and IRF4, in cDC1s and cDC2s, respectively, mediate suppression of inflammasome activation by limiting the expression of inflammasome-associated genes. Overexpression of IRF4 or IRF8 inhibits inflammasome activation in macrophages, while reduced expression of IRF8 leads to aberrant inflammasome activation in cDC1s and hampers their ability to prime CD8 T cells. Thus, activation of inflammasome in DCs is detrimental to adaptive immunity, and our results reveal that cDCs use IRF4 and IRF8 to suppress this response.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a pathway that degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons. Here we describe a genome-wide screen for NMD factors that uncovers an unexpected mechanism that broadly governs 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR)-directed regulation. The screen reveals that NMD requires lysosomal acidification, which allows transferrin-mediated iron uptake, which, in turn, is necessary for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3ʹ UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3ʹ UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Because of the sensitivity of the Fe-S cluster of ABCE1 to iron availability and reactive oxygen species, these findings reveal an unanticipated vulnerability of 3ʹ UTR-directed regulation to lysosomal dysfunction, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory information is selectively or non-selectively enhanced and inhibited in the brain, but it remains unclear whether and how this occurs at the most peripheral level. Using in vivo calcium imaging of mouse olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium in wild-type and mutant animals, we show that odors produce not only excitatory but also inhibitory responses in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Heterologous assays indicate that odorants can act as agonists to some but inverse agonists to other odorant receptors. We also demonstrate that responses to odor mixtures are extensively suppressed or enhanced in OSNs. When high concentrations of odors are mixed, widespread antagonism suppresses the overall response amplitudes and density. In contrast, a mixture of low concentrations of odors often produces synergistic effects and boosts the faint odor inputs. Thus, odor responses are extensively tuned by inhibition, antagonism, and synergy at the most peripheral level, contributing to robust sensory representations.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) comprise agonists and antagonists, which display promising therapeutic activities in cancer and autoimmunity, respectively. We previously showed that epitope and isotype interact to deliver optimal agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs. The impact of Fc engineering on antagonists, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that clinically relevant antagonists used for treating autoimmune conditions can be converted into potent FcγR-independent agonists with remarkable antitumor activity by isotype switching to hIgG2. One antagonist is converted to a super-agonist with greater potency than previously reported highly agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs. Such conversion is dependent on the unique disulfide bonding properties of the hIgG2 hinge. This investigation highlights the transformative capacity of the hIgG2 isotype for converting antagonists to agonists to treat cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Terminal differentiation is essential for the development and maintenance of tissues in all multi-cellular organisms and is associated with permanent exit from the cell cycle. Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinate differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Using live, single-cell imaging of cell cycle progression and differentiation commitment during adipogenesis, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger differentiation commitment simultaneously with permanent exit from the cell cycle. We identify a molecular competition in G1 between when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes that allows mitogen and differentiation stimuli to control the balance between terminally differentiating cells produced and progenitor cells kept in reserve, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs.

There is increasing evidence that the biogenesis of mitoribosomes is an intricate pathway, involving many assembly factors. To better understand this process, we investigated native assembly intermediates of the mitoribosomal large subunit from the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei using cryo-electron microscopy. We identify 28 assembly factors, 6 of which are homologous to bacterial and eukaryotic ribosome assembly factors. They interact with the partially folded rRNA by specifically recognizing functionally important regions such as the peptidyltransferase center. The architectural and compositional comparison of the assembly intermediates indicates a stepwise modular assembly process, during which the rRNA folds toward its mature state. During the process, several conserved GTPases and a helicase form highly intertwined interaction networks that stabilize distinct assembly intermediates. The presented structures provide general insights into mitoribosomal maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic genome activation (EGA) is orchestrated by an intrinsic developmental program initiated during oocyte maturation with translation of stored maternal mRNAs. Here, we show that tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase that regulates β-catenin levels, undergoes programmed translation during oocyte maturation and serves an essential role in mouse EGA. Newly translated TNKS triggers proteasomal degradation of axin, reducing targeted destruction of β-catenin and promoting β-catenin-mediated transcription of target genes, including Myc. MYC mediates ribosomal RNA transcription in 2-cell embryos, supporting global protein synthesis. Suppression of tankyrase activity using knockdown or chemical inhibition causes loss of nuclear β-catenin and global reductions in transcription and histone H3 acetylation. Chromatin and transcriptional profiling indicate that development arrests prior to the mid-2-cell stage, mediated in part by reductions in β-catenin and MYC. These findings indicate that post-transcriptional regulation of tankyrase serves as a ligand-independent developmental mechanism for post-translational β-catenin activation and is required to complete EGA.

Abstract: Artificial in vitro blood production has been presented by recent literature as a necessary and achievable aim. In order to obtain the required hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) proliferation and differentiation for mature blood cell production, studies have been conducted on using either cytokine-rich conditions or co-culturing with other cells. Alternatively, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture environments (such as tissue scaffolds) have been shown to affect cell morphology, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated decellularized cancellous bones (DCBs), which provide 3D structure and natural extracellular matrix, as a scaffold for preserving and growing HSC niches in vitro. Additionally, we optimized a cell seeding method using mesenchymal stem cells as supporting cells. We discovered that, although adhering only to the top of DCBs when seeded at 37 °C, mesenchymal stem cells adhered to the inside of the scaffold at 4 °C, indicating that the seeding temperature is important to control the adherence ability of stem cells. This, in turn, was revealed to be important for HSC cell seeding on 3D extracellular matrix, and provides the required cell methodology to use DCBs as a great scaffold for blood cell production.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental growth requires coordination between the growth rates of individual tissues and organs. Here, we examine how Drosophila neuromuscular synapses grow to match the size of their target muscles. We show that changes in muscle growth driven by autonomous modulation of insulin receptor signaling produce corresponding changes in synapse size, with each muscle affecting only its presynaptic motor neuron branches. This scaling growth is mechanistically distinct from synaptic plasticity driven by neuronal activity and requires increased postsynaptic differentiation induced by insulin receptor signaling in muscle. We identify the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor dPix as an effector of insulin receptor signaling. Alternatively spliced dPix isoforms that contain a specific exon are necessary and sufficient for postsynaptic differentiation and scaling growth, and their mRNA levels are regulated by insulin receptor signaling. These findings define a mechanism by which the same signaling pathway promotes both autonomous muscle growth and non-autonomous synapse growth.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-derived β (SC-β) cells could provide unlimited human β cells toward a curative diabetes treatment. Differentiation of SC-β cells yields transplantable islets that secrete insulin in response to glucose challenges. Following transplantation into mice, SC-β cell function is comparable to human islets, but the magnitude and consistency of response in vitro are less robust than observed in cadaveric islets. Here, we profile metabolism of SC-β cells and islets to quantify their capacity to sense glucose and identify reduced anaplerotic cycling in the mitochondria as the cause of reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in SC-β cells. This activity can be rescued by challenging SC-β cells with intermediate metabolites from the TCA cycle and late but not early glycolysis, downstream of the enzymes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. Bypassing this metabolic bottleneck results in a robust, bi-phasic insulin release in vitro that is identical in magnitude to functionally mature human islets.

Abstract: Summary
There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here we evaluate the capacity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. We included 36 whole-genome-characterized PDOs from 23 OC patients with known clinical histories. OC PDOs maintain the genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulate patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel combination treatment. PDOs display inter- and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, which can be partially explained by genetic aberrations. PDO drug screening identifies high responsiveness to at least one drug for 88% of patients. PDOs are valuable preclinical models that can provide insights into drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge of genetic and drug response heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X) is frequently mutated in the Wingless (WNT) and Sonic hedghog (SHH) subtypes of medulloblastoma—the commonest malignant childhood brain tumor, but whether DDX3X functions as a medulloblastoma oncogene or tumor suppressor gene is not known. Here, we show that Ddx3x regulates hindbrain patterning and development by controlling Hox gene expression and cell stress signaling. In mice predisposed to Wnt- or Shh medulloblastoma, Ddx3x sensed oncogenic stress and suppressed tumor formation. WNT and SHH medulloblastomas normally arise only in the lower and upper rhombic lips, respectively. Deletion of Ddx3x removed this lineage restriction, enabling both medulloblastoma subtypes to arise in either germinal zone. Thus, DDX3X is a medulloblastoma tumor suppressor that regulates hindbrain development and restricts the competence of cell lineages to form medulloblastoma subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor with few therapeutic options. The disease presents with a complex spectrum of genomic aberrations, but the pharmacological consequences of these aberrations are partly unknown. Here, we report an integrated pharmacogenomic analysis of 100 patient-derived GBM cell cultures from the human glioma cell culture (HGCC) cohort. Exploring 1,544 drugs, we find that GBM has two main pharmacological subgroups, marked by differential response to proteasome inhibitors and mutually exclusive aberrations in TP53 and CDKN2A/B. We confirm this trend in cell and in xenotransplantation models, and identify both Bcl-2 family inhibitors and p53 activators as potentiators of proteasome inhibitors in GBM cells. We can further predict the responses of individual cell cultures to several existing drug classes, presenting opportunities for drug repurposing and design of stratified trials. Our functionally profiled biobank provides a valuable resource for the discovery of new treatments for GBM.

Abstract: To date, no study evaluated the effect of oxygen deprivation together with statins pretreatment on human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The aim of our study was to establish the influence of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on MSC proliferation and cytotoxicity in different oxygenic conditions. Human MSCs isolated from the bone marrow (n = 12) were incubated with statins. The proliferation rate and cytotoxic effect were evaluated in normoxic (21 %O2) and hypoxic (2%O2) conditions, also in relation to donor age. The treatment with atorvastatin was associated with significantly higher proliferation rate compared to control, both in hypoxic (19 % median increase) and normoxic conditions (20 %), p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively. Atorvastatin had no significant cytotoxic effect on MSCs. Treatment with rosuvastatin in hypoxia resulted in significantly higher proliferation rate (15 %, p = 0.02) comparing to control with no significant cytotoxicity. In atmospheric oxygen concentration, rosuvastatin was associated with no significant change in proliferation and higher cytotoxicity compared to untreated control (p = 0.042 and p = 0.015, for 0.04 μM and 1 μM solutions respectively). There were no differences in the effect of statins on MSC from young donors vs. aged donors. These results suggest that statins could support MSC-based therapy of acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Calmodulin (CaM) is the principle mediator of the Ca2+ signal in all eukaryotic cells. A huge variety of basic cellular processes including cell cycle control, proliferation, secretion and motility, among many others are governed by CaM, which regulates activities of myriads of target proteins. Mammalian CaM is encoded by three genes localized on different chromosomes all producing an identical protein. In this study, we have generated HeLa human cancer cells conditionally expressing CaM in a genetic background with all three genes inactivated by CRISPR/Cas9. We demonstrate that downregulation of ectopically expressed CaM is achieved after 120 h, when cells are arrested in the M phase of the cell cycle. We show for the first time that CaM downregulation in human cancer cells is followed by a multinucleated senescent state as indicated by expression of β-galactosidase as well as cell morphology typical for senescent cells. Our newly generated genetic system may be useful for the analysis of other CaM regulated processes in eukaryotic cells in the absence of endogenous CaM genes.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions at high resolution remains experimentally and computationally challenging. Here we used a low-input “easy Hi-C” protocol to map the 3D genome architecture in human neurogenesis and brain tissues and also demonstrated that a rigorous Hi-C bias-correction pipeline (HiCorr) can significantly improve the sensitivity and robustness of Hi-C loop identification at sub-TAD level, especially the enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during development. Interestingly, we concluded that Hi-C loop outperforms eQTL in explaining neurological GWAS results, revealing a unique value of high-resolution 3D genome maps in elucidating the disease etiology.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the prominent role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration, its physiological and pathological functions are not fully understood. Here, we report an unexpected role of TDP-43 in the formation of dynamic, reversible, liquid droplet-like nuclear bodies (NBs) in response to stress. Formation of NBs alleviates TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity in mammalian cells and fly neurons. Super-resolution microscopy reveals distinct functions of the two RRMs in TDP-43 NB formation. TDP-43 NBs are partially colocalized with nuclear paraspeckles, whose scaffolding lncRNA NEAT1 is dramatically upregulated in stressed neurons. Moreover, increase of NEAT1 promotes TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. Finally, we discover that the ALS-associated mutation D169G impairs the NEAT1-mediated TDP-43 LLPS and NB assembly, causing excessive cytoplasmic translocation of TDP-43 to form stress granules, which become phosphorylated TDP-43 cytoplasmic foci upon prolonged stress. Together, our findings suggest a stress-mitigating role and mechanism of TDP-43 NBs, whose dysfunction may be involved in ALS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has led to therapeutic responses in some cancer patients for whom no effective treatment previously existed. ICB acts on T lymphocytes and other immune cells that are inactivated due to checkpoint signals that inhibit their infiltration and function within tumors. But for more than 80% of patients, immunotherapy has not been effective. Here, we demonstrate a cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to ICB mediated by baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2 (BIRC2). Knockdown of BIRC2 expression in mouse melanoma or breast cancer cells increases expression of the chemokine CXCL9 and impairs tumor growth by increasing the number of intratumoral activated CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Administration of anti-CXCL9 neutralizing antibody inhibits the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells to BIRC2-deficient tumors. Most importantly, BIRC2 deficiency dramatically increases the sensitivity of mouse melanoma and breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1 ICB.

Abstract: Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are self-renewing cells of neural lineage that can be differentiated into neurons of different subtypes. Here we show that SEPT7, a member of the family of filament-forming GTPases called septins, prevents constitutive Ca2+ entry through the store-operated Ca2+ entry channel, Orai in hNPCs and in differentiated neurons and is thus required for neuronal calcium homeostasis. Previous work in Drosophila neurons has shown that loss of one copy of the evolutionarily-conserved dSEPT7 gene leads to elevated Ca2+ entry via Orai, in the absence of ER-Ca2+ store depletion. We have identified an N-terminal polybasic region of SEPT7, known to interact with membrane-localized phospholipids, as essential for spontaneous calcium entry through Orai in hNPCs, whereas the GTPase domain of dSEPT7 is dispensable for this purpose. Re-organisation of Orai1 and the ER-Ca2+ sensor STIM1 observed near the plasma membrane in SEPT7 KD hNPCs, supports the idea that Septin7 containing heteromers prevent Ca2+ entry through a fraction of STIM-Orai complexes. Possible mechanisms by which SEPT7 reduction leads to opening of Orai channels in the absence of store-depletion are discussed.

Abstract: Summary
The underlying mechanisms by which prior immunity to dengue virus (DENV) affords cross-protection against the related flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) are poorly understood. Here, we examine the ability of DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4+ T cells to protect against versus exacerbate ZIKV infection by using a histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1∗0101 transgenic, interferon α/β receptor-deficient mouse model that supports robust DENV and ZIKV replication. By mapping the HLA-DRB1∗0101-restricted T cell response, we identify DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4+ T cell epitopes that stimulate interferon gamma (IFNγ) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Vaccination of naive HLA-DRB1∗0101 transgenic mice with these peptides induces a CD4+ T cell response sufficient to reduce tissue viral burden following ZIKV infection. Notably, this protective response requires IFNγ and/or TNF secretion but not anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin G (IgG) production. Thus, DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD4+ T cells producing canonical Th1 cytokines can suppress ZIKV replication in an antibody-independent manner. These results may have important implications for increasing the efficacy and safety of DENV/ZIKV vaccines and for developing pan-flavivirus vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
The neuronal protein complexin contains multiple domains that exert clamping and facilitatory functions to tune spontaneous and action potential-triggered synaptic release. We address the clamping mechanism and show that the accessory helix of complexin arrests assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex that forms the core machinery of intracellular membrane fusion. In a reconstituted fusion assay, site- and stage-specific photo-cross-linking reveals that, prior to fusion, the complexin accessory helix laterally binds the membrane-proximal C-terminal ends of SNAP25 and VAMP2. Corresponding complexin interface mutants selectively increase spontaneous release of neurotransmitters in living neurons, implying that the accessory helix suppresses final zippering/assembly of the SNARE four-helix bundle by restraining VAMP2 and SNAP25.

Abstract: Summary
A subset of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients will relapse and succumb to therapy-resistant disease. The bone marrow microenvironment may support B-ALL progression and treatment evasion. Utilizing single-cell approaches, we demonstrate B-ALL bone marrow immune microenvironment remodeling upon disease initiation and subsequent re-emergence during conventional chemotherapy. We uncover a role for non-classical monocytes in B-ALL survival, and demonstrate monocyte abundance at B-ALL diagnosis is predictive of pediatric and adult B-ALL patient survival. We show that human B-ALL blasts alter a vascularized microenvironment promoting monocytic differentiation, while depleting leukemia-associated monocytes in B-ALL animal models prolongs disease remission in vivo. Our profiling of the B-ALL immune microenvironment identifies extrinsic regulators of B-ALL survival supporting new immune-based therapeutic approaches for high-risk B-ALL treatment.

Abstract: Summary
When O2 is plentiful, the mitochondrial electron transport chain uses it as a terminal electron acceptor. However, the mammalian retina thrives in a hypoxic niche in the eye. We find that mitochondria in retinas adapt to their hypoxic environment by reversing the succinate dehydrogenase reaction to use fumarate to accept electrons instead of O2. Reverse succinate dehydrogenase activity produces succinate and is enhanced by hypoxia-induced downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. Retinas can export the succinate they produce to the neighboring O2-rich retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex. There, succinate enhances O2 consumption by severalfold. Malate made from succinate in the pigment epithelium can then be imported into the retina, where it is converted to fumarate to again accept electrons in the reverse succinate dehydrogenase reaction. This malate-succinate shuttle can sustain these two tissues by transferring reducing power from an O2-poor tissue (retina) to an O2-rich one (retinal pigment epithelium-choroid).

Abstract: Summary
Axons connect neurons together, establishing the wiring architecture of neuronal networks. Axonal connectivity is largely built during embryonic development through highly constrained processes of axon guidance, which have been extensively studied. However, the inability to control axon guidance, and thus neuronal network architecture, has limited investigation of how axonal connections influence subsequent development and function of neuronal networks. Here, we use zebrafish motor neurons expressing a photoactivatable Rac1 to co-opt endogenous growth cone guidance machinery to precisely and non-invasively direct axon growth using light. Axons can be guided over large distances, within complex environments of living organisms, overriding competing endogenous signals and redirecting axons across potent repulsive barriers to construct novel circuitry. Notably, genetic axon guidance defects can be rescued, restoring functional connectivity. These data demonstrate that intrinsic growth cone guidance machinery can be co-opted to non-invasively build new connectivity, allowing investigation of neural network dynamics in intact living organisms.

Abstract: We designed experiments to assess whether fungal cell wall mannans function as an immune shield or an immune agonist. Fungal cell wall β-(1,3)-glucan normally plays a major and dominant role in immune activation. The outer mannan layer has been variously described as an immune shield, because it has the potential to mask the underlying β-(1,3)-glucan, or an immune activator, as it also has the potential to engage with a wide range of mannose detecting PRRs. To resolve this conundrum we examined species-specific differences in host immune recognition in the och1Δ N-mannosylation-deficient mutant background in four species of yeast-like fungi. Irrespective of the fungal species, the cytokine response (TNFα and IL-6) induced by the och1Δ mutants in human monocytes was reduced compared to that of the wild type. In contrast, TNFα production induced by och1Δ was increased, relative to wild type, due to increased β-glucan exposure, when mouse or human macrophages were used. These observations suggest that N-mannan is not a major PAMP for macrophages and that in these cells mannan does shield the fungus from recognition of the inner cell wall β-glucan. However, N-mannan is a significant inducer of cytokine for monocytes. Therefore the metaphor of the fungal “mannan shield” can only be applied to some, but not all, myeloid cells used in immune profiling experiments of fungal species.

Abstract: Summary
The NIPBL/MAU2 heterodimer loads cohesin onto chromatin. Mutations in NIPBL account for most cases of the rare developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Here we report a MAU2 variant causing CdLS, a deletion of seven amino acids that impairs the interaction between MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus. Investigating this interaction, we discovered that MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus are largely dispensable for normal cohesin and NIPBL function in cells with a NIPBL early truncating mutation. Despite a predicted fatal outcome of an out-of-frame single nucleotide duplication in NIPBL, engineered in two different cell lines, alternative translation initiation yields a form of NIPBL missing N-terminal residues. This form cannot interact with MAU2, but binds DNA and mediates cohesin loading. Altogether, our work reveals that cohesin loading can occur independently of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and highlights a novel mechanism protective against out-of-frame mutations that is potentially relevant for other genetic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in dendritic morphology in response to activity have long been thought to be a critical component of how neural circuits develop to properly encode sensory information. Ventral-preferring direction-selective ganglion cells (vDSGCs) have asymmetric dendrites oriented along their preferred direction, and this has been hypothesized to play a critical role in their tuning. Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input. These data indicate that different mechanisms of a cell’s computational abilities can be constructed over development through divergent mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
During thymic development and upon peripheral activation, T cells undergo extensive phenotypic and functional changes coordinated by lineage-specific developmental programs. To characterize the regulatory landscape controlling T cell identity, we perform a wide epigenomic and transcriptional analysis of mouse thymocytes and naive CD4 differentiated T helper cells. Our investigations reveal a dynamic putative enhancer landscape, and we could validate many of the enhancers using the high-throughput CapStarr sequencing (CapStarr-seq) approach. We find that genes using multiple promoters display increased enhancer usage, suggesting that apparent “enhancer redundancy” might relate to isoform selection. Furthermore, we can show that two Runx3 promoters display long-range interactions with specific enhancers. Finally, our analyses suggest a novel function for the PRC2 complex in the control of alternative promoter usage. Altogether, our study has allowed for the mapping of an exhaustive set of active enhancers and provides new insights into their function and that of PRC2 in controlling promoter choice during T cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Local translation is a conserved mechanism conferring cells the ability to quickly respond to local stimuli. In the brain, it has been recently reported in astrocytes, whose fine processes contact blood vessels and synapses. Yet the specificity and regulation of astrocyte local translation remain unknown. We study hippocampal perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) and show that they contain the machinery for translation. Using a refined immunoprecipitation technique, we characterize the entire pool of ribosome-bound mRNAs in PAPs and compare it with the one expressed in the whole astrocyte. We find that a specific pool of mRNAs is highly polarized at the synaptic interface. These transcripts encode an unexpected molecular repertoire, composed of proteins involved in iron homeostasis, translation, cell cycle, and cytoskeleton. Remarkably, we observe alterations in global RNA distribution and ribosome-bound status of some PAP-enriched transcripts after fear conditioning, indicating the role of astrocytic local translation in memory and learning.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin is an evolutionarily conserved chromosome-associated protein complex essential for chromosome segregation, gene expression, and repair of DNA damage. Mutations that affect this complex cause the human developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), thought to arise from defective embryonic transcription. We establish a significant role for placental defects in the development of CdLS mouse embryos (Nipbl and Hdac8). Placenta is a naturally senescent tissue; we demonstrate that persistent DNA damage potentiates senescence and activates cytokine signaling. Mutant embryo developmental outcomes are significantly improved in the context of a wild-type placenta or by genetically restricting cytokine signaling. Our study highlights that cohesin is required for maintaining ploidy and the repair of spontaneous DNA damage in placental cells, suggesting that genotoxic stress and ensuing placental senescence and cytokine production could represent a broad theme in embryo health and viability.

Abstract: Nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1) protein has been identified as an obligatory transcription factor in midbrain dopaminergic neurogenesis, but the global set of human NURR1 target genes remains unexplored. Here, we identified direct gene targets of NURR1 by analyzing genome-wide differential expression of NURR1 together with NURR1 consensus sites in three human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines. Microarray data were validated by quantitative PCR in hNSCs and mouse embryonic brains and through comparison to published human data, including genome-wide association study hits and the BioGPS gene expression atlas. Our analysis identified ~40 NURR1 direct target genes, many of them involved in essential protein modules such as synapse formation, neuronal cell migration during brain development, and cell cycle progression and DNA replication. Specifically, expression of genes related to synapse formation and neuronal cell migration correlated tightly with NURR1 expression, whereas cell cycle progression correlated negatively with it, precisely recapitulating midbrain dopaminergic development. Overall, this systematic examination of NURR1-controlled regulatory networks provides important insights into this protein’s biological functions in dopamine-based neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Damage-associated microglia (DAM) profiles observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related mouse models reflect an activation state that could modulate AD risk or progression. To learn whether human AD microglia (HAM) display a similar profile, we develop a method for purifying cell types from frozen cerebrocortical tissues for RNA-seq analysis, allowing better transcriptome coverage than typical single-nucleus RNA-seq approaches. The HAM profile we observe bears little resemblance to the DAM profile. Instead, HAM display an enhanced human aging profile, in addition to other disease-related changes such as APOE upregulation. Analyses of whole-tissue RNA-seq and single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets corroborate our findings and suggest that the lack of DAM response in human microglia occurs specifically in AD tissues, not other neurodegenerative settings. These results, which can be browsed at http://research-pub.gene.com/BrainMyeloidLandscape, provide a genome-wide picture of microglial activation in human AD and highlight considerable differences between mouse models and human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Protein Lys methylation plays a critical role in numerous cellular processes, but it is challenging to identify Lys methylation in a systematic manner. Here we present an approach combining in silico prediction with targeted mass spectrometry (MS) to identify Lys methylation (Kme) sites at the proteome level. We develop MethylSight, a program that predicts Kme events solely on the physicochemical properties of residues surrounding the putative methylation sites, which then requires validation by targeted MS. Using this approach, we identify 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b. Furthermore, MethylSight predicts that Lys methylation is a prevalent post-translational modification in the human proteome. Our work provides a useful resource for guiding systematic exploration of the role of Lys methylation in human health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Human tumors with exonuclease domain mutations in the gene encoding DNA polymerase ε (POLE) have incredibly high mutation burdens. These errors arise in four unique mutation signatures occurring in different relative amounts, the etiologies of which remain poorly understood. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer human cell lines expressing POLE tumor variants, with and without mismatch repair (MMR). Whole-exome sequencing of these cells after defined numbers of population doublings permitted analysis of nascent mutation accumulation. Unlike an exonuclease active site mutant that we previously characterized, POLE cancer mutants readily drive signature mutagenesis in the presence of functional MMR. Comparison of cell line and human patient data suggests that the relative abundance of mutation signatures partitions POLE tumors into distinct subgroups dependent on the nature of the POLE allele, its expression level, and MMR status. These results suggest that different POLE mutants have previously unappreciated differences in replication fidelity and mutagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we propose an approach to identify active metabolic pathways by integrating gene essentiality analysis and protein abundance. We use two bacterial species (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma agalactiae) that share a high gene content similarity yet show significant metabolic differences. First, we build detailed metabolic maps of their carbon metabolism, the most striking difference being the absence of two key enzymes for glucose metabolism in M. agalactiae. We then determine carbon sources that allow growth in M. agalactiae, and we introduce glucose-dependent growth to show the functionality of its remaining glycolytic enzymes. By analyzing gene essentiality and performing quantitative proteomics, we can predict the active metabolic pathways connected to carbon metabolism and show significant differences in use and direction of key pathways despite sharing the large majority of genes. Gene essentiality combined with quantitative proteomics and metabolic maps can be used to determine activity and directionality of metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a disease that kills over 1 million people each year. Its cell envelope is a common antibiotic target and has a unique structure due, in part, to two lipidated polysaccharides—arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan. Arabinofuranosyltransferase D (AftD) is an essential enzyme involved in assembling these glycolipids. We present the 2.9-Å resolution structure of M. abscessus AftD, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. AftD has a conserved GT-C glycosyltransferase fold and three carbohydrate-binding modules. Glycan array analysis shows that AftD binds complex arabinose glycans. Additionally, AftD is non-covalently complexed with an acyl carrier protein (ACP). 3.4- and 3.5-Å structures of a mutant with impaired ACP binding reveal a conformational change, suggesting that ACP may regulate AftD function. Mutagenesis experiments using a conditional knockout constructed in M. smegmatis confirm the essentiality of the putative active site and the ACP binding for AftD function.
