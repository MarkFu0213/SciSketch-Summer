Abstract: Cardiac fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast is a crucial process in the development of cardiac fibrosis and is tightly dependent on transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1). The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) regulates many cell functions, including cell death by apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. However, several aspects of this process remain unclear, including the role of FoxO1 in cardiac fibroblast differentiation and the regulation of FoxO1 by TGF-β1. Here, we report that TGF-β1 stimulates FoxO1 expression, promoting its dephosphorylation, nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. TGF-β1 also increases differentiation markers such as α-smooth muscle actin, connective tissue growth factor, and pro-collagen I, whereas it decreases cardiac fibroblast proliferation triggered by fetal bovine serum. TGF-β1 also increases levels of p21waf/cip-cycle inhibiting factor protein, a cytostatic factor promoting cell cycle arrest and cardiac fibroblast differentiation. In addition, TGF-β1 increases cardiac fibroblast contractile capacity as assessed by collagen gel contraction assay. The effect of TGF-β1 on cardiac fibroblast differentiation was prevented by FoxO1 down-regulation and enhanced by FoxO1 overexpression. Thus, our findings reveal that FoxO1 is regulated by TGF-β1 and plays a critical role in cardiac fibroblast differentiation. We propose that FoxO1 is an attractive new target for anti-fibrotic therapy.

Abstract: Inflammation and inflammatory mediators are intimately linked with chemoresistance through complex pathways in the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanism by which inflammatory mediators (e.g., eicosanoids) contribute to chemoresistance remains elusive. In this study, we found that the low-affinity leukotriene B4 receptor-2 (BLT2) and its ligand leukotriene B4 were highly up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells and play critical roles in mediating the chemoresistance through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) and the subsequent up-regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6). BLT2 depletion with siRNA clearly abolished the chemoresistance to cisplatin in SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells and further increased cell sensitivity to cisplatin chemotherapy by down-regulating the ‘STAT-3-IL-6’ cascade. Enlarged tumor formation due to the cisplatin resistance of SK-OV-3 cells in cisplatin-treated athymic mice was also substantially reduced by co-treatment with the BLT2 inhibitor in vivo. Our study demonstrates that BLT2 is a novel contributor to cisplatin resistance in SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells and thus may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

Abstract: The first member of the uncoupling protein (UCP) family, brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), was identified in 1976. Twenty years later, two closely related proteins, UCP2 and UCP3, were described in mammals. Homologs of these proteins exist in other organisms, including plants. Uncoupling refers to a deterioration of energy conservation between substrate oxidation and ADP phosphorylation. Complete energy conservation loss would be fatal but fine-tuning can be beneficial for processes such as thermogenesis, redox control, and prevention of mitochondrial ROS release. The coupled/uncoupled state of mitochondria is related to the permeability of the inner membrane and the proton transport mediated by activated UCPs underlies the uncoupling activity of these proteins. Proton transport by UCP1 is activated by fatty acids and this ensures thermogenesis. In vivo in absence of this activation UCP1 remains inhibited with no transport activity. A similar situation now seems unlikely for UCP2 and UCP3 and while activation of their proton transport has been described its physiological relevance remains uncertain and their influence can be envisaged as a result of another transport pathway that takes place in the absence of activation.

Abstract: An accurate way to characterize the functional potential of a protein is to analyze recognized protein domains encoded by the genes in a given group. The epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein module found primarily in proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated trafficking. In this work, we investigate the function of the single ENTH-containing protein from the protist Giardia lamblia by testing its function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein, named GlENTHp (for G. lamblia ENTH protein), is involved in Giardia in endocytosis and in protein trafficking from the ER to the vacuoles, fulfilling the function of the ENTH proteins epsin and epsinR, respectively. There are two orthologs of epsin, Ent1p and Ent2p, and two orthologs of epsinR, Ent3p and Ent5p in S. cerevisiae. Although the expression of GlENTHp neither complemented growth in the ent1Δent2Δ mutant nor restored the GFP-Cps1 vacuolar trafficking defect in ent3Δent5Δ, it interfered with the normal function of Ent3/5 in the wild-type strain. The phenotype observed is linked to a defect in Cps1 localization and α-factor mating pheromone maturation. The finding that GlENTHp acts as dominant negative epsinR in yeast cells reinforces the phylogenetic data showing that GlENTHp belongs to the epsinR subfamily present in eukaryotes prior to their evolution into different taxa.

Abstract: GTP binding proteins are classified into two families: heterotrimeric large G proteins which are composed of three subunits, and one subunit of small G proteins. Roles of small G proteins in the intracellular trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were studied. Among various small G proteins tested, GTP-bound form (G23V) of RalA inhibited the internalization of dopamine D2 receptor independently of the previously reported downstream effectors of RalA, such as Ral-binding protein 1 and PLD. With high affinity for GRK2, active RalA inhibited the GPCR endocytosis by sequestering the GRK2 from receptors. When it was tested for several GPCRs including an endogenous GPCR, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1, agonist-induced conversion of GTP-bound to GDP-bound RalA, which presumably releases the sequestered GRK2, was observed selectively with the GPCRs which have tendency to undergo endocytosis. Conversion of RalA from active to inactive state occurred by translocation of RGL, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, from the plasma membrane to cytosol as a complex with Gβγ. These results suggest that agonist-induced Gβγ-mediated conversion of RalA from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form could be a mechanism to facilitate agonist-induced internalization of GPCRs.

Abstract: The skin possesses a photosensitive system comprised of opsins whose function is not fully understood, and clock genes which exert an important regulatory role in skin biology. Here, we evaluated the presence of opsins in normal (Melan-a cells) and malignant (B16–F10 cells) murine melanocytes. Both cell lines express Opn2, Opn4 – for the first time reported in these cell types – as well as S-opsin. OPN4 protein was found in a small area capping the cell nuclei of B16–F10 cells kept in constant dark (DD); twenty-four hours after the white light pulse (WLP), OPN4 was found in the cell membrane. Despite the fact that B16–F10 cells expressed less Opn2 and Opn4 than Melan-a cells, our data indicate that the malignant melanocytes exhibited increased photoresponsiveness. The clock gene machinery is also severely downregulated in B16–F10 cells as compared to Melan-a cells. Per1, Per2, and Bmal1 expression increased in B16–F10 cells in response to WLP. Although no response in clock gene expression to WLP was observed in Melan-a cells, gene correlational data suggest a minor effect of WLP. In contrast to opsins and clock genes, melanogenesis is significantly upregulated in malignant melanocytes in comparison to Melan-a cells. Tyrosinase expression increased after WLP only in B16–F10 cells; however no increase in melanin content after WLP was seen in either cell line. Our findings may prove useful in the treatment and the development of new pharmacological approaches of depigmentation diseases and skin cancer.

Abstract: Protein modification with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a reversible process regulating many central biological pathways. The reversibility of SUMOylation is ensured by SUMO proteases many of which belong to the sentrin/SUMO-specific protease (SENP) family. In recent years, many advances have been made in allocating SENPs to specific biological pathways. However, due to difficulties in obtaining recombinant full-length active SENPs for thorough enzymatic characterization, our knowledge on these proteases is still limited. In this work, we used in vitro synthesized full-length human SENPs to perform a side-by-side comparison of their activities and substrate specificities. ProSUMO1/2/3, RanGAP1–SUMO1/2/3 and polySUMO2/3 chains were used as substrates in these analyses. We found that SENP1 is by far the most versatile and active SENP whereas SENP3 stands out as the least active of these enzymes. Finally, a comparison between the activities of full-length SENPs and their catalytic domains suggests that in some cases their non-catalytic regions influence their activity.

Abstract: CNOT6L is a deadenylase subunit belonging to the CCR4-NOT complex, a major deadenylase complex in eukaryotes involved at multiple levels in regulation of gene expression. While CNOT6L is expressed in skeletal muscle cells, its specific functions in this tissue are still largely unknown. Our previous work highlighted the functional of CNOT6L in skeletal muscle cell differentiation. To further explore how CNOT6L regulates myogenesis, we used here gene expression analysis to identify CNOT6L mRNA targets in human myoblasts. Among these novel targets, IL-8 (interleukin 8) mRNA was the most upregulated in CNOT6L knock-down (KD) cells. Biochemical approaches and poly (A) tail length assays showed that IL-8 mRNA is a direct target of CNOT6L, and further investigations by loss- and gain-of-function assays pointed out that IL-8 is an important effector of myogenesis. Therefore, we have characterized CNOT6L-IL-8 as a new signaling axis that regulates myogenesis.

Abstract: Adenosine is known to reduce inflammation by suppressing the activity of most immune cells. Previous studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated mouse macrophages produce adenosine, and the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) signaling activated in an autocrine manner attenuates LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine formation. It has been suggested that A2AR signaling inhibits LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production through a unique cAMP-dependent, but PKA- and Epac-independent signaling pathway. However, the mechanism of inhibition was not identified so far. Here we report that LPS stimulation enhances A2AR expression in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages, and loss of A2ARs results in enhanced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response. Loss of A2ARs in A2AR null macrophages did not alter the LPS-induced NF-κB activation, but an enhanced basal and LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases (especially that of JNKs) was detected in A2AR null cells. A2AR signaling did not alter the LPS-induced phosphorylation of their upstream kinases, but by regulating adenylate cyclase activity it enhanced the expression of dual specific phosphatase (DUSP)1, a negative regulator of MAP kinases. As a result, lower basal and LPS-induced DUSP1 mRNA and protein levels can be detected in A2AR null macrophages. Silencing of DUSP1 mRNA expression resulted in higher basal and LPS-induced JNK phosphorylation and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine formation in wild type macrophages, but had no effect on that in A2AR null cells. Our data indicate that A2AR signaling regulates both basal and LPS-induced DUSP1 levels in macrophages via activating the adenylate cyclase pathway.

PCGF2 negatively regulates arsenic trioxide-induced PML-RARA protein degradation via UBE2I inhibition in NB4 cells,

Abstract: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a therapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) which induces PML-RARA protein degradation via enhanced UBE2I-mediated sumoylation. PCGF2, a Polycomb group protein, has been suggested as an anti-SUMO E3 protein by inhibiting the sumoylation of UBE2I substrates, HSF2 and RANGAP1, via direct interaction. Thus, we hypothesized that PCGF2 might play a role in ATO-induced PML-RARA degradation by interacting with UBE2I. PCGF2 protein was down-regulated upon ATO treatment in human APL cell line, NB4. Knockdown of PCGF2 in NB4 cells, in the absence of ATO treatment, was sufficient to induce sumoylation-, ubiquitylation- and PML nuclear body-mediated degradation of PML-RARA protein. Moreover, overexpression of PCGF2 protected ATO-mediated degradation of ectopic and endogenous PML-RARA in 293T and NB4 cells, respectively. In 293T cells, UBE2I-mediated PML-RARA degradation was reduced upon PCGF2 co-expression. In addition, UBE2I-mediated sumoylation of PML-RARA was reduced upon PCGF2 co-expression and PCGF2-UBE2I interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Likewise, endogenous PCGF2-UBE2I interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays in NB4 cells. Intriguingly, upon ATO-treatment, such interaction was disrupted and UBE2I was co-immunoprecipitated or co-localized with its SUMO substrate, PML-RARA. Taken together, our results suggested a novel role of PCGF2 in ATO-mediated degradation of PML-RARA that PCGF2 might act as a negative regulator of UBE2I via direct interaction.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is primarily recognized as the site of synthesis and folding of secreted membrane-bound and certain organelle-targeted proteins. Optimum protein folding requires several factors, including ATP, Ca2+ and an oxidizing environment to allow disulphide-bond formation. ER is highly sensitive to stress that perturb cellular energy levels, the redox state or the Ca2+ concentration. Such stresses reduce the protein folding capacity of the ER, resulting in the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins, a condition referred to as unfolded protein response (UPR). Matricellular proteins of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, NOV) family play essential roles in extracellular matrix signaling and turnover. They exhibit a similar type of organization and share a closely related primary structure, including 38 conserved cysteine residues. Since CCN1/CYR61 overexpression in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) induces ER stress-related apoptosis, we endeavored to investigate whether the adenovirus mediated gene transfer of other members of CCN proteins incurs ER stress in primary HSC and hepatocytes. We found Ad5-CMV-CCN2, Ad5-CMV-CCN3 and Ad5-CMV-CCN4 to induce ER stress and UPR comparable to Ad5-CMV-CCN1. UPR is a pro-survival response to reduce accumulation of unfolded proteins and restore normal ER functioning. If, however protein aggregation is persistent and the stress cannot be resolved, signaling switches from pro-survival to pro-apoptosis. The observed CCN-induced UPR is relevant in wound healing responses and essential for hepatic tissue repair following liver injury. Adenoviral gene transfer induced massive amounts of matricellular proteins proving to effectively mitigate liver fibrosis if targeted cell specific in HSC and myofibroblasts.

Abstract: Tumor cell migration and invasion are essential steps in the metastatic cascade that has great impact on patient outcomes. Spatial and temporal organization of Ca2+ signaling regulates the multiple aspects of migration machinery, including cytoskeletal reorganization, traction force generation, and focal adhesion dynamics. Stromal interaction molecules (STIM) and Orai proteins, recently identified as critical constituents of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), have been implicated in cancer cell migration and tumor metastasis. The clinical significance of STIM proteins and Orai Ca2+ channels in tumor progression and their diagnostic and prognostic potentials have also been demonstrated in different types of cancers. Here we review the recent advances in understanding the important roles and regulatory mechanisms of STIM/Orai-mediated SOCE in cancer spread. The clinical implications and the emergence as a selective target for cancer therapeutics are also discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Calcium and Cell Fate.

Abstract: Heat shock protein-70kDa (Hsp70) is a member of molecular chaperone family, involved in the proper folding of various proteins. Hsp70 is important for tumor cell survival and is also reported to be involved in enhancing the drug resistance of various cancer types. Hsp70 controls apoptosis both upstream and downstream of the mitochondria by regulating the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) and apoptosome formation respectively. In the present study, we have elucidated the role of Hsp70 in Gambogic acid (GA) induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. We observed that functional inhibition of Hsp70 by Pifithrin-μ switches GA induced caspase dependent (apoptotic) cell death to caspase independent cell death. However, this cell death was not essentially necrotic in nature, as shown by the observations like intact plasma membranes, cytochrome-c release and no significant effect on nuclear condensation/fragmentation. Inhibition of Hsp70 by Pifithrin-μ shows differential effect on MMP. GA induced MMP and cytochrome-c release was inhibited by Pifithrin-μ at 12h but enhanced at 24h. Pifithrin-μ also reverted back GA inhibited autophagy which resulted in the degradation of accumulated ubiquitinated proteins. Our results demonstrate that Hsp70 plays an important role in GA induced apoptosis by regulating caspase activation. Therefore, inhibition of Hsp70 may hamper with the caspase dependent apoptotic pathways induced by most anti-cancer drugs and reduce their efficacy. However, the combination therapy with Pifithrin-μ may be particularly useful in targeting apoptotic resistant cancer cells as Pifithrin-μ may initiate alternative cell death program in these resistant cells.

Abstract: Ventricular hypertrabeculation (noncompaction) is a poorly characterized condition associated with heart failure. The condition is widely assumed to be the retention of the trabeculated ventricular design of the embryo and ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates. This assumption appears simplistic and counterfactual. Here, we measured a set of anatomical parameters in hypertrabeculation in man and in the ventricles of embryos and animals. We compared humans with left ventricular hypertrabeculation (N=21) with humans with structurally normal left ventricles (N=54). We measured ejection fraction and ventricular trabeculation using cardiovascular MRI. Ventricular trabeculation was further measured in series of embryonic human and 9 animal species, and in hearts of 15 adult animal species using MRI, CT, or histology. In human, hypertrabeculated left ventricles were significantly different from structurally normal left ventricles by all structural measures and ejection fraction. They were far less trabeculated than human embryonic hearts (15–40% trabeculated volume versus 55–80%). Early in development all vertebrate embryos acquired a ventricle with approximately 80% trabeculations, but only ectotherms retained the 80% trabeculation throughout development. Endothermic (warm-blooded) animals including human slowly matured in fetal and postnatal stages towards ventricles with little trabeculations, generally less than 30%. Further, the trabeculations of all embryos and adult ectotherms were very thin, less than 50μm wide, whereas the trabeculations in adult endotherms and in the setting of hypertrabeculation were wider by orders of magnitude. It is concluded in contrast to a prevailing assumption, the hypertrabeculated left ventricle is not like the ventricle of the embryo or of adult ectotherms.

Abstract: Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a Ca2+ mobilizing second messenger that belongs to the superfamily of regulatory adenine nucleotides. Though NAADP has been known since 20years, several aspects of its metabolism and molecular mode of action are still under discussion. Though the importance of the type 1 ryanodine receptor was discovered and published already in 2002 Hohenegger et al. (2002 Oct 15) , recent data re-emphasize these original findings in pancreatic acinar cells and in T-lymphocytes. Here we review recent developments in NAADP formation and metabolism, putative target Ca2+ channels for NAADP with special emphasis on the type 1 ryanodine receptor, and NAADP binding proteins. The latter are basis for a unifying hypothesis for NAADP action. Finally, the role of NAADP in T cell Ca2+ signaling and activation is discussed.

Abstract: Adipocyte differentiation is critical in obesity. By controlling new adipocyte recruitment, adipogenesis contrasts adipocyte hypertrophy and its adverse consequences, such as insulin resistance. Contrasting data are present in literature on the effect of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent unfolded protein response (UPR) on adipocyte differentiation, being reported to be either necessary or inhibitory. In this study, we sought to clarify the effect of ER stress and UPR on adipocyte differentiation. We have used two different cell lines, the widely used pre-adipocyte 3T3–L1 cells and a murine multipotent mesenchymal cell line, W20-17 cells. A strong ER stress activator, thapsigargin, and a pathologically relevant inducer of ER stress, glucosamine (GlcN), induced ER stress and UPR above those occurring in the absence of perturbation and inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Very low concentrations of 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA, a chemical chaperone) inhibited only the overactivation of ER stress and UPR elicited by GlcN, leaving unaltered the part physiologically activated during differentiation, and reversed the inhibitory effect of GlcN on differentiation. In addition, GlcN stimulated proinflammatory cytokine release and PBA prevented these effects. An inhibitor of NF-kB also reversed the effects of GlcN on cytokine release. These results indicate that while ER stress and UPR activation is “physiologically” activated during adipocyte differentiation, the “pathologic” part of ER stress activation, secondary to a glucotoxic insult, inhibits differentiation. In addition, such a metabolic insult, causes a shift of the preadipocyte/adipocyte population towards a proinflammatory phenotype.

Abstract: The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) protein superfamily negatively controls G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways. One of the members of this family, RGS16, is highly expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets. Studies of its function in platelet and megakaryocyte biology have been limited, in part, due to lack of pharmacological inhibitors. For example, RGS16 overexpression inhibited CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated megakaryocyte migration. More recent studies showed that the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF1α or CXCL12) regulates platelet function via CXCR4. Based on these considerations, the present study investigated the capacity of RGS16 to regulate CXCL12-dependent platelet function, using the RGS16 knockout mouse model (Rgs16−/−). RGS16-deficient platelets had increased protease activated receptor 4 and collagen-induced aggregation, as well as increased CXCL12-dependent agonist-induced aggregation, dense and alpha granule secretion, integrin αIIbβ3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure compared to those from WT littermates. CXCL12 alone did not stimulate aggregation or secretion in either RGS16-deficient or WT platelets. Furthermore, platelets from Rgs16−/− mice displayed enhanced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt following CXCL12 stimulation relative to controls. Finally, we also found that PKCδ is involved in regulating CXCL12-dependent activation of ERK and Akt, in the Rgs16-deficient platelets. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that RGS16 plays an important role in platelet function by modulating CXCL12-dependent platelet activation.

Abstract: The Cullin9 gene encodes a putative E3 ligase that serves a wide variety of biological functions in mitosis, whereas its roles in meiosis have not yet clearly defined. Here, we report that Cullin9 accumulates on the spindle apparatus and colocalizes with the microtubule fibers during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Depletion of Cullin9 by morpholino microinjection results in a remarkably higher rate of disorganized spindles and misaligned chromosomes in oocytes, which is coupled with the impaired kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Resultantly, the incidence of aneuploid eggs significantly increases in Cullin9-depleted oocytes. Moreover, we show that Cullin9 controls Survivin's protein level during meiotic maturation, and thus regulates microtubule stability in oocytes. Thus, our study assigns a new meiotic function to Cullin9 and reveals that it prevents mouse eggs from aneuploidy by regulating microtubule dynamics via Survivin.

Abstract: Faithful segregation of chromosomes is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. In a genetic screen to identify genes related to checkpoint function, we have characterized the role of rna14, an essential gene in the maintenance of chromosome dynamics. We demonstrate that Rna14 localizes in the nucleus and in the absence of functional Rna14, the cells exhibit chromosomal segregation defects. The mutant allele of rna14 exhibits genetic interaction with key kinetochore components and spindle checkpoint proteins. Inactivation of rna14 leads to accumulation of Bub1-GFP foci, a protein required for spindle checkpoint activation that could be due to the defects in the attachment of mitotic spindle to the chromosome. Consistently, the double mutant of rna14-11 and bub1 knockout exhibits high degree of chromosome mis-segregation. At restrictive condition, the rna14-11 mutant cells exhibit defects in cell cycle progression with high level of septation. The orthologs of Rna14 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc Rna14) and human (CstF3) contain similar domain architecture and are required for 3′-end processing of pre-mRNA. We have also demonstrated that the fission yeast Rna14 is required to prevent transcriptional read-through. These findings reveal the importance of transcription termination in the maintenance of genomic stability through the regulation of kinetochore function.

Abstract: Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis involves pro-apoptotic protein release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, triggering apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which apoptotic initiators cross the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) remain unclear. The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), an OMM protein, is central to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In previous work, we demonstrated that apoptosis induction is associated with VDAC1 oligomerization, forming a mega-pore that mediates pro-apoptotic protein release. Here, we demonstrated that several known anion transport inhibitors, DIDS, SITS, H2DIDS, DNDS, and DPC, all interact with VDAC1, as revealed by micro-scale thermophoresis and decreased conductance of bilayer-reconstituted VDAC1. These compounds inhibited apoptosis stimuli-induced release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis and VDAC1 oligomerization, as monitored by chemical cross-linking or in living cells by BRET2. Moreover, the compounds inhibited VDAC1 oligomerization in isolated mitochondria and as induced by VDAC1 over-expression, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of the tested compounds involved VDAC1. Finally, the compounds also inhibited apoptosis-associated increases in intracellular Ca2+, ([Ca2+]i), ROS production, mitochondria membrane potential dissipation and the increase in VDAC1 expression levels. The results presented here explored a new mechanism of action for DIDS and its analogs. All inhibited apoptosis via direct interaction with VDAC1 to inhibit its oligomerization and subsequent Cyto c release and apoptosis. Such results may allow the development of a VDAC1-specific inhibitor that would offer substantial insight into the function of VDAC1 in controlling metabolism, energy production, cholesterol transport and apoptosis. Finally, inhibitors of apoptosis could serve in pathological conditions where enhanced apoptosis is found, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Peroxisome number and quality are maintained by its biogenesis and turnover and are important for the homeostasis of peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are increased in number by division with dynamic morphological changes including elongation, constriction, and fission. In the course of peroxisomal division, peroxisomal morphogenesis is orchestrated by Pex11β, dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1), and mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). Conversely, peroxisome number is reduced by its degradation. Peroxisomes are mainly degraded by pexophagy, a type of autophagy specific for peroxisomes. Upon pexophagy, an adaptor protein translocates on peroxisomal membrane and connects peroxisomes to autophagic machineries. Molecular mechanisms of pexophagy are well studied in yeast systems where several specific adaptor proteins are identified. Pexophagy in mammals also proceeds in a manner dependent on adaptor proteins. In this review, we address the recent progress in studies on peroxisome morphogenesis and pexophagy.

Abstract: Osteoblasts are emerging regulators of myeloid malignancies since genetic alterations in them, such as constitutive activation of β-catenin, instigate their appearance. The LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), initially proposed to be a co-receptor for Wnt proteins, in fact favors bone formation by suppressing gut-serotonin synthesis. This function of Lrp5 occurring in the gut is independent of β-catenin activation in osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether Lrp5 can act directly in osteoblast to influence other functions that require β-catenin signaling, particularly, the deregulation of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic properties of β-catenin activation in osteoblasts, that lead to development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mice with gain-of-function (GOF) Lrp5 alleles (Lrp5A214V) that recapitulate the human high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, as well as patients with the T253I HBM Lrp5 mutation, we show here that Lrp5 GOF mutations in both humans and mice do not activate β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. Consistent with a lack of β-catenin activation in their osteoblasts, Lrp5A214V mice have normal trilinear hematopoiesis. In contrast to leukemic mice with constitutive activation of β-catenin in osteoblasts (Ctnnb1CAosb), accumulation of early myeloid progenitors, a characteristic of AML, myeloid-blasts in blood, and segmented neutrophils or dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, are not observed in Lrp5A214V mice. Likewise, peripheral blood count analysis in HBM patients showed normal hematopoiesis, normal percentage of myeloid cells, and lack of anemia. We conclude that Lrp5 GOF mutations do not activate β-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. As a result, myeloid lineage differentiation is normal in HBM patients and mice.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lysophospholipid, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. LPA exerts its biological effects mainly through binding to cell-surface LPA receptors (LPA1-6), which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Recent studies suggest that cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and GPCRs modulates GPCRs-mediated signaling. Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) is a RTK, which mediates nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced biological functions including cell migration in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Here, we show LPA1 transactivation of TrkA in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE12). LPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA in both time- and dose-dependent manners. Down-regulation of LPA1 by siRNA transfection attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of TrkA, suggesting a cross-talk between LPA1 and TrkA. To investigate the molecular regulation of the cross-talk, we focused on the interaction between LPA1 and TrkA. We found that LPA induced interaction between LPA1 and TrkA. The LPA1/TrkA complex was localized on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. The C-terminus of LPA1 was identified as the binding site for TrkA. Inhibition of TrkA attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of TrkA and LPA1 internalization, as well as lung epithelial cell migration. These studies provide a molecular mechanism for the transactivation of TrkA by LPA, and suggest that the cross-talk between LPA1 and TrkA regulates LPA-induced receptor internalization and lung epithelial cell migration.

Abstract: Understanding of the regulation mechanisms of CXCR4 signaling is essential for revealing its role in physiological and pathological processes. Though biochemical pathways following CXCR4 activation by its ligand CXCL12 are well established, knowledge about the receptor dynamics on the plasma membrane remains limited. Here we used Ewing sarcoma-derived cells to unravel the processes that are involved in regulating CXCR4 dynamics on the plasma membrane during receptor signaling. Single-molecule epi-fluorescence microscopy showed that CXCR4 was present in monomeric state on the plasma membrane independent of receptor stimulation. However, upon activation freely diffusing receptors were immobilized in a ligand concentration-dependent manner. CXCR4 immobilization was strongly correlated with the ability for G-protein signaling and was a precursor of subsequent endocytotic events. Our data suggest that, a balanced regulation of G-protein dependent and independent pathways is required for controlling CXCR4 receptor mobility, and potentially subsequent controlled signal transduction.

Abstract: Incidence of colorectal cancer is closely related with the lifestyle, especially the dietary habits of patients. Epidemiological researches have demonstrated a negative correlation between legume consumption and colorectal cancer incidence. Lectins/hemagglutinins are a type of carbohydrate binding proteins which are abundantly stored in legumes. Their eminent pH-stability allows them to survive digestion and remain active in the intestine where they may have direct contact with colorectal tumors. It is therefore interesting to explore the direct interaction between lectins/hemagglutinins and colorectal cancer. In the present research, we reported a detailed research on the interaction between a hemagglutinin isolated from an edible legume with two colorectal cancer cell lines. This hemagglutinin (NCBBH) was found to first bind to tumor cell membrane as early as 30min post treatment and was gradually transported inside the cytoplasm within 3h, with some of it localized in the Golgi apparatus and some in the lysosomes. After its entrance, the hemagglutinin induced aggregation of the Golgi apparatus, which in turn adversely affected the transportation of protein from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, resulting in protein accumulation in ER and ER stress. The hemagglutinin-treated cells also manifested severe mitochondrial malformation and membrane depolarization, accompanied by obvious apoptosis characteristics, like chromatin condensation, phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation. Collectively, our results indicate that the hemaggltuinin could successfully enter the cytoplasm of colorectal cancer cells and adversely affect their growth, providing a mechanism in support of the application of edible legumes to the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Shikonin derivatives exert powerful cytotoxic effects including induction of apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate the cytotoxic efficacy of shikonin in vivo in xenograft models, which did not affect body weight as well as its reduction of cell viability in vitro using several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We found that inhibition of AKT by shikonin activated the forkhead box (FOX)O3a/early growth response protein (EGR)1 signaling cascade and enhanced the expression of the target gene Bim, leading to apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Overexpression of wild-type or a constitutively active mutant of FOXO3a enhanced shikonin-induced Bim expression. The NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin (SIRT)1 amplified the pro-apoptotic effect by deacetylating FOXO3a, which induced EGR1 binding to the Bim promoter and activated Bim expression. Meanwhile, PI3K/AKT activity was enhanced, whereas that of FOXO3a was reduced and p300 was upregulated by treatment with a sublethal dose of shikonin. FOXO3a acetylation was enhanced by p300 overexpression, while shikonin-induced Bim expression was suppressed by p300 overexpression, which promoted cell survival. FOXO3a acetylation was increased by p300 overexpression and treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor, improving cell survival. In addition, shikonin-induced FOXO3a nuclear localization was blocked by AKT activation and SIRT1 inhibition, which blocked Bim expression and conferred resistance to the cytotoxic effects of shikonin. The EGR1 increase induced by shikonin was restored by pretreatment with SIRT1 inhibitor. These results suggest that shikonin induces apoptosis in some lung cancer cells via activation of FOXO3a/EGR1/SIRT1 signaling, and that AKT and p300 negatively regulate this process via Bim upregulation.

Abstract: Surface expressed proteoglycans mediate the binding of cytokines and chemokines to the cell surface and promote migration of various tumor cell types including epithelial tumor cells. We here demonstrate that binding of the chemokine-like inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to epithelial lung and breast tumor cell lines A549 and MDA-MB231 is sensitive to enzymatic digestion of heparan sulphate chains and competitive inhibition with heparin. Moreover, MIF interaction with heparin was confirmed by chromatography and a structural comparison indicated a possible heparin binding site. These results suggested that proteoglycans carrying heparan sulphate chains are involved in MIF binding. Using shRNA-mediated gene silencing, we identified syndecan-1 as the predominant proteoglycan required for the interaction with MIF. MIF binding was decreased by induction of proteolytic shedding of syndecan-1, which could be prevented by inhibition of the metalloproteinases involved in this process. Finally, MIF induced the chemotactic migration of A549 cells, wound closure and invasion into matrigel without affecting cell proliferation. These MIF-induced responses were abrogated by heparin or by silencing of syndecan-1. Thus, our study indicates that syndecan-1 on epithelial tumor cells promotes MIF binding and MIF-mediated cell migration. This may represent a relevant mechanism through which MIF enhances tumor cell motility and metastasis.

Abstract: We have analyzed the distribution of mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex proteins and mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB) proteins over (sub)complexes and over species. The MICOS proteins are associated with the formation and maintenance of mitochondrial cristae. Indeed, the presence of MICOS genes in genomes correlates well with the presence of cristae: all cristae containing species have at least one MICOS gene and cristae-less species have none. Mic10 is the most widespread MICOS gene, while Mic60 appears be the oldest one, as it originates in the ancestors of mitochondria, the proteobacteria. In proteobacteria the gene occurs in clusters with genes involved in heme synthesis while the protein has been observed in intracellular membranes of the alphaproteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In contrast, Mic23 and Mic27 appear to be the youngest MICOS proteins, as they only occur in opisthokonts. The remaining MICOS proteins, Mic10, Mic19, Mic25 and Mic12, the latter we show to be orthologous to human C19orf70/QIL1, trace back to the root of the eukaryotes. Of the remaining MIB proteins, also DNAJC11 shows a high correlation with the presence of cristae. In mitochondrial protein complexome profiles, the MIB complex occurs as a defined complex and as separate subcomplexes, potentially reflecting various assembly stages. We find three main forms of the complex: A) The MICOS complex, containing all the MICOS proteins, B) a membrane bridging subcomplex, containing in addition SAMM50, MTX2 and the previously uncharacterized MTX3, and C) the complete MIB complex containing in addition DNAJC11 and MTX1.

Abstract: GRWD1 was previously identified as a novel Cdt1-binding protein that possesses histone-binding and nucleosome assembly activities and promotes MCM loading, probably by maintaining chromatin openness at replication origins. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities remain unknown. We prepared reconstituted mononucleosomes from recombinant histones and a DNA fragment containing a nucleosome positioning sequence, and investigated the effects of GRWD1 on them. GRWD1 could disassemble these preformed mononucleosomes in vitro in an ATP-independent manner. Thus, our data suggest that GRWD1 facilitates removal of H2A-H2B dimers from nucleosomes, resulting in formation of hexasomes. The activity was compromised by deletion of the acidic domain, which is required for efficient histone binding. In contrast, nucleosome assembly activity of GRWD1 was not affected by deletion of the acidic domain. In HeLa cells, the acidic domain of GRWD1 was necessary to maintain chromatin openness and promote MCM loading at replication origins. Taken together, our results suggest that GRWD1 promotes chromatin fluidity by influencing nucleosome structures, e.g., by transient eviction of H2A-H2B, and thereby promotes efficient MCM loading at replication origins.

Abstract: The molecular basis involving adsorption of pulmonary surfactant at the respiratory air–liquid interface and the specific roles of the surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C in this process have not been completely resolved. The reasons might be found in the largely unknown structural assembly in which surfactant lipids and proteins are released from alveolar type II cells, and the difficulties to sample, manipulate and visualize the adsorption of these micron-sized particles at an air–liquid interface under appropriate physiological conditions. Here, we introduce several approaches to overcome these problems. First, by immunofluorescence we could demonstrate the presence of SP-B and SP-C on the surface of exocytosed surfactant particles. Second, by sampling the released particles and probing their adsorptive capacity we could demonstrate a remarkably high rate of interfacial adsorption, whose rate and extent was dramatically affected by treatment with antibodies against SP-B and SP-C. The effect of both antibodies was additive and specific. Third, direct microscopy of an inverted air–liquid interface revealed that the blocking effect is due to a stabilization of the released particles when contacting the air–liquid interface, precluding their transformation and the formation of surface films. We conclude that SP-B and SP-C are acting as essential, preformed molecular keys in the initial stages of surfactant unpacking and surface film formation. We further propose that surfactant activation might be transduced by a conformational change of the surfactant proteins upon contact with surface forces acting on the air–liquid interface.

Abstract: The peroxisomal proteins (peroxins) that mediate the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins have been identified. Recently, the purification of a functional peroxisomal translocon has been reported. However, the molecular details of the import pathways and the mechanisms by which the cargo is translocated into the lumen of the organelle are still poorly understood. Structural studies have begun to provide insight into molecular mechanisms of peroxisomal import pathways for cargo proteins that harbor peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, at their C- and N-termini, respectively. So far structures have been reported for binary or tertiary protein–protein interfaces, and highlight the role of intrinsically disordered regions for these interactions. Here, we provide an overview of the currently available structural biology of peroxisomal import pathways. Current challenges and future perspectives of the structural biology of peroxisomal protein translocation are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: The importance of peroxisomes is highlighted by severe inherited human disorders linked to impaired peroxisomal biogenesis. Besides the simple architecture of these ubiquitous and dynamic organelles, their biogenesis is surprisingly complex and involves specialized proteins, termed peroxins, which mediate targeting and insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) into the peroxisomal bilayer, and the import of soluble proteins into the protein-dense matrix of the organelle. The long-standing paradigm that all peroxisomal proteins are imported directly into preexisting peroxisomes has been challenged by the detection of PMPs inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). New models propose that the ER originates peroxisomal biogenesis by mediating PMP trafficking to the peroxisomes via budding vesicles. However, the relative contribution of this ER-derived pathway to the total peroxisome population in vivo, and the detailed mechanisms of ER entry and exit of PMPs are controversially discussed. This review aims to summarize present knowledge about how PMPs are targeted to the ER, instead of being inserted directly into preexisting peroxisomes. Moreover, molecular mechanisms that facilitate bilayer insertion of PMPs among different species are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: The Notch signalling pathway is widely utilised during embryogenesis in situations where cell–cell interactions are important for cell fate specification and differentiation. DSL ligand endocytosis into the ligand-expressing cell is an important aspect of Notch signalling because it is thought to supply the force needed to separate the Notch heterodimer to initiate signal transduction. A functional role for receptor endocytosis during Notch signal transduction is more controversial. Here we have used live-cell imaging to examine trafficking of the Notch1 receptor in response to ligand binding. Contact with cells expressing ligands induced internalisation and intracellular trafficking of Notch1. Notch1 endocytosis was accompanied by transendocytosis of ligand into the Notch1-expressing signal-receiving cell. Ligand caused Notch1 endocytosis into SARA-positive endosomes in a manner dependent on clathrin and dynamin function. Moreover, inhibition of endocytosis in the receptor-expressing cell impaired ligand-induced Notch1 signalling. Our findings resolve conflicting observations from mammalian and Drosophila studies by demonstrating that ligand-dependent activation of Notch1 signalling requires receptor endocytosis. Endocytosis of Notch1 may provide a force on the ligand:receptor complex that is important for potent signal transduction.

Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 4 (PEBP4) is a secreted protein and has multiple functions,

Abstract: Phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins (PEBP) represent a superfamily of proteins that are conserved from bacteria to humans. In mammals, four members have been identified, PEBP1–4. To determine the functional differences among PEBP1–4 and the underlying mechanism for their actions, we performed a sequence alignment and found that PEBP4 contains a signal peptide and potential glycosylation sites, whereas PEBP1–3 are intracellular proteins. To test if PEBP4 is secreted, we made constructs with Myc epitope at the amino (N) terminus or carboxyl (C) terminus to mask the signal sequence or keep it free, respectively. Our data revealed that both mouse and human PEBP4 were secreted when the epitope was tagged at their C-terminus. To our surprise, secretion was dependent upon the C-terminal conserved domain in addition to the N-terminal signal sequence. When the epitope was placed to the N-terminus, the recombinant protein failed to secrete and instead, was retained in the cytoplasm. Mass spectrometry detected asparagine (N)-glycosylation on the secreted PEBP4. Although overexpression of N-terminal tagged PEBP4 resulted in an inhibition of ERK activation by EGF, that with a C-terminal epitope tag did not have such an effect. Likewise, transfection of PEBP4 shRNA did not appear to affect ERK activation, suggesting that PEBP4 does not participate in the regulation of this pathway. In contrast, PEBP4 siRNA suppressed phosphorylation of Act at S473. Therefore, our results suggest that PEBP4 is a multifunctional protein and can be secreted. It will be important to investigate the mechanism by which PEBP4 is secreted and regulates cellular events.

Abstract: Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) is found at increased in the malignant ascites of tumor patients and induces perinuclear reorganization of keratin 8 (K8) filaments that contribute to the viscoelasticity of metastatic cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism of SPC-induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization is not clear. We observed that SPC dose-dependently reduced the expression of epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2) in lung cancer cells. Then, we examined the role of EMP2 in SPC-induced phosphorylation and reorganization of K8 in lung cancer cells. We found that SPC concentration-dependently reduced EMP2 in A549, H1299, and other lung cancer cells. This was verified at the mRNA level by RT-PCR and real-time PCR (qPCR), and intracellular variation through confocal microscopy. EMP2 gene silencing and stable lung cancer cell lines established using EMP2 lentiviral shRNA induced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization. EMP2 overexpression reduced K8 phosphorylation and reorganization. We also observed that SPC-induced loss of EMP2 induces phosphorylation of JNK and ERK via reduced expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Loss of EMP2 induces ubiquitination of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). SPC induced caveolin-1 (cav-1) expression and EEA1 endosome marker protein but not cav-2. SPC treatment enhanced the binding of cav-1 and PP2A and lowered binding of PP2A and alpha4. Gene silencing of EMP2 increased and gene silencing of cav-1 reduced migration of A549 lung cancer cells. Overall, these results suggest that SPC induces EMP2 down-regulation which reduces the PP2A via ubiquitination induced by cav-1, which sequestered alpha4, leading to the activation of ERK and JNK.

Abstract: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) disease results from inactivation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, and is characterized by benign tumors in several organs. Because TSC tumorigenesis correlates with hyperactivation of mTORC1, current therapies focus on mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin or its analogs. Rapamycin-induced tumor shrinkage has been reported, but tumor recurrence occurs on withdrawal from rapamycin. Autophagy has been associated with development of TSC tumors and with tumor cell survival during rapamycin treatment. mTORC1 and AMPK directly inhibit and activate autophagy, respectively. AMPK is hyperactivated in TSC cells and tumors, and drives cytoplasmic sequestration of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27KIP (p27). Whether AMPK and p27 are involved in rapamycin-induced autophagy and survival of TSC cells remain unexplored. Here, we show that inhibition of AMPK by compound C or by shRNA-mediated depletion of LKB1 reduces activation of autophagy by rapamycin in Tsc2-null cells. Similarly, shRNA-mediated depletion of p27 inhibited rapamycin-induced autophagy. In support of p27 lying downstream of AMPK on the activation of autophagy in Tsc2-null cells, a p27 mutant that preferentially localizes in the cytosol recovered the effect of rapamycin on autophagy in both p27- and LKB1-depleted cells, but a nuclear p27 mutant was inactive. Finally, we show that p27-dependent activation of autophagy is involved in Tsc2-null cell survival under rapamycin treatment. These results indicate that an AMPK/p27 axis is promoting a survival mechanism that could explain in part the relapse of TSC tumors treated with rapamycin, exposing new avenues for designing more efficient treatments for TSC patients.

Abstract: Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) are intimately involved in the control of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. They reduce Ca2+ in the cytosol not only by direct ejection, but also by controlling the formation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and decreasing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool. In mammals four genes (PMCA1–4) are expressed, and alternative RNA splicing generates more than twenty variants. The variants differ in their regulatory characteristics. They localize into highly specialized membrane compartments and respond to the incoming Ca2+ with distinct temporal resolution. The expression pattern of variants depends on cell type; a change in this pattern can result in perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis and thus altered cell function. Indeed, PMCAs undergo remarkable changes in their expression pattern during tumorigenesis that might significantly contribute to the unbalanced Ca2+ homeostasis of cancer cells.

Abstract: RAS proteins function as molecular switches that transmit signals from cell surface receptors into specific cellular responses via activation of defined signaling pathways (Fang, 2015). Aberrant constitutive RAS activation occurs with high incidence in different types of cancer (Bos, 1989). Thus, inhibition of RAS-mediated signaling is extremely important for therapeutic approaches against cancer. Here we showed that the ribonuclease (RNase) binase, directly interacts with endogenous KRAS. Further, molecular structure models suggested an inhibitory nature of binase-RAS interaction involving regions of RAS that are important for different aspects of its function. Consistent with these models, phosphorylation analysis of effectors of RAS-mediated signaling revealed that binase inhibits the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, RAS activation assays using a non-hydrolysable GTP analog (GTPγS) demonstrated that binase interferes with the exchange of GDP by GTP. Furthermore, we showed that binase reduced the interaction of RAS with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), SOS1. Our data support a model in which binase-KRAS interaction interferes with the function of GEFs and stabilizes the inactive GDP-bound conformation of RAS thereby inhibiting MAPK/ERK signaling. This model plausibly explains the previously reported, antitumor-effect of binase specific towards RAS-transformed cells and suggests the development of anticancer therapies based on this ribonuclease.

Abstract: Over the past 30years the mitochondrial permeability transition – the permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane due to the opening of a wide pore – has progressed from being considered a curious artifact induced in isolated mitochondria by Ca2+ and phosphate to a key cell-death-inducing process in several major pathologies. Its relevance is by now universally acknowledged and a pharmacology targeting the phenomenon is being developed. The molecular nature of the pore remains to this day uncertain, but progress has recently been made with the identification of the FOF1 ATP synthase as the probable proteic substrate. Researchers sharing this conviction are however divided into two camps: these believing that only the ATP synthase dimers or oligomers can form the pore, presumably in the contact region between monomers, and those who consider that the ring-forming c subunits in the FO sector actually constitute the walls of the pore. The latest development is the emergence of a new candidate: Spastic Paraplegia 7 (SPG7), a mitochondrial AAA-type membrane protease which forms a 6-stave barrel. This review summarizes recent developments of research on the pathophysiological relevance and on the molecular nature of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Channels edited by Pierre Sonveaux, Pierre Maechler and Jean-Claude Martinou.

Abstract: Cell migration is dependent on the microtubule network for structural support as well as for the proper delivery and positioning of polarity proteins at the leading edge of migrating cells. Identification of drugs that target cytoskeletal-dependent cell migration and protein transport in polarized migrating cells is important in understanding the cell biology of normal and tumor cells and can lead to new therapeutic targets in disease processes. Here, we show that the tricyclic compound TBE-31 directly binds to tubulin and interferes with microtubule dynamics, as assessed by end binding 1 (EB1) live cell imaging. Interestingly, this interference is independent of in vitro tubulin polymerization. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we also observed that TBE-31 interferes with the polarity of migratory cells. The polarity proteins Rac1, IQGAP and Tiam1 were localized at the leading edge of DMSO-treated migrating cell, but were observed to be in multiple protrusions around the cell periphery of TBE-31-treated cells. Finally, we observed that TBE-31 inhibits the migration of Rat2 fibroblasts with an IC50 of 0.75μM. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of cell migration by TBE-31 may result from the improper maintenance of cell polarity of migrating cells.

Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton coordinates numerous fundamental cellular processes. Fimbrins are a class of evolutionally conserved ABPs that mediate actin bundling and regulate actin dynamics and functions. In this study, we identified the fimbrin Sac6 from the important fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Interestingly, deletion of SAC6 led to increased tolerance to oxidative stress, while its overexpression caused hyper-susceptibility to this stress. Further investigations revealed that Sac6, by interaction with actin, negatively regulated the cytosol-to-nucleus transport of the key OSR (oxidative stress response) transcription factor Cap1 and consequent expression of OSR genes. Moreover, loss of Sac6 enhanced hyphal maintenance, and its overexpression caused a defect in hyphal development, which was attributed to abnormal expression of morphogenesis-related genes. In addition, Sac6 was involved in regulation of secretion of lytic enzymes and virulence of C. albicans. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which fimbrin transcriptionally regulates OSR and morphogenesis, and sheds a novel light on the functions of actin cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Dual laser flow cytometric energy transfer (FCET) – elaborated by Trón et al. in 1984 – is an efficient and rapid way of measuring FRET on large cell populations. FRET efficiency and the donor and acceptor concentrations are determined from one donor and two acceptor signals. In this communication this method is extended towards the domain of receptor dynamics by the detection of polarized components of the three intensities. By enabling a complete description of the proximity and dynamics of FRET-systems, the new measuring scheme allows a more refined description of both the structure and dynamics of cell surface receptor clusters at the nano-scale and beyond. Associated donor fraction, limiting anisotropy and rotational correlation time of the donor, acceptor anisotropy and cell-by-cell estimation of the orientation factor for FRET (κ2) are available in the steady state on a single FRET sample in a very rapid and statistically efficient way offered by flow cytometry. For a more sensitive detection of conformational changes the “polarized FRET indices” – quantities composed from FRET efficiency and anisotropies – are proposed. The method is illustrated by measurements on a FRET system with changing FRET-fraction and on a two donor-one acceptor-system, when the existence of receptor trimers are proven by the detection of “hetero-FRET induced homo-FRET relief”, i.e. the diminishing of homo-FRET between the two donors in the presence of a donor quencher. The method also offers higher sensitivity for assessing conformational changes at the nano-scale, due to its capability for the simultaneous detection of changes of proximity and relative orientations of the FRET donor and acceptor. Although the method has been introduced in the context of FRET, it is more general: It can be used for monitoring triple-anisotropy correlations also in those cases when FRET actually does not occur, e.g. for interactions occuring beyond the Förster-distance R0. Interpretation of κ2 has been extended.

Abstract: Arsenic, a metalloid with cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects related to the disruption of glutathione homeostasis, induces the expression of ATF4, a central transcription factor in the cellular stress response. However, the interplay between factors downstream of ATF4 is incompletely understood. In this article, we investigate the role of Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3), a regulatory member of the ATF4 pathway, in determining cell sensitivity to arsenite. Our results show that arsenite potently upregulates Trib3 mRNA and protein in an ATF4-dependent manner in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Trib3-deficient cells display increased susceptibility to arsenite-induced cell death, which is rescued by re-expressing TRIB3. In cells lacking TRIB3, arsenite stress leads to markedly elevated mRNA and protein levels of Chac1, a gene that encodes a glutathione-degrading enzyme and is not previously known to be repressed by TRIB3. Analysis of the Chac1 promoter identified two regulatory elements that additively mediate the induction of Chac1 by arsenite and ATF4, as well as the robust suppression of Chac1 by TRIB3. Crucially, Chac1 silencing enhances glutathione levels and eliminates the increased susceptibility of Trib3-deficient cells to arsenite stress. Moreover, Trib3-deficient cells demonstrate an increased rate of glutathione consumption, which is abolished by Chac1 knockdown. Taken together, these data indicate that excessive Chac1 expression is detrimental to arsenite-treated cell survival and that TRIB3 is critical for restraining the pro-death potential of Chac1 during arsenite stress, representing a novel mechanism of cell viability regulation that occurs within the ATF4 pathway.

Abstract: The expression and function of TRPV1 are influenced by its interaction with cellular proteins. Here, we identify Whirlin, a cytoskeletal PDZ-scaffold protein implicated in hearing, vision and mechanosensory transduction, as an interacting partner of TRPV1. Whirlin associates with TRPV1 in cell lines and in primary cultures of rat nociceptors. Whirlin is expressed in 55% of mouse sensory C-fibers, including peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors, and co-localizes with TRPV1 in 70% of them. Heterologous expression of Whirlin increased TRPV1 protein expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane, and promoted receptor clustering. Silencing Whirlin expression with siRNA or blocking protein translation resulted in a concomitant degradation of TRPV1 that could be prevented by inhibiting the proteasome. The degradation kinetics of TRPV1 upon arresting protein translation mirrored that of Whirlin in cells co-expressing both proteins, suggesting a parallel degradation mechanism. Noteworthy, Whirlin expression significantly reduced TRPV1 degradation induced by prolonged exposure to capsaicin. Thus, our findings indicate that Whirlin and TRPV1 are associated in a subset of nociceptors and that TRPV1 protein stability is increased through the interaction with the cytoskeletal scaffold protein. Our results suggest that the Whirlin–TRPV1 complex may represent a novel molecular target and its pharmacological disruption might be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of peripheral TRPV1-mediated disorders.

Abstract: The present study showed that RNA helicase Belle (DDX3) was required intrinsically for mitotic progression and survival of germline stem cells (GSCs) and spermatogonial cells in the Drosophila melanogaster testes. We found that deficiency of Belle in the male germline resulted in a strong germ cell loss phenotype. Early germ cells are lost through cell death, whereas somatic hub and cyst cell populations are maintained. The observed phenotype is related to that of the human Sertoli Cell-Only Syndrome caused by the loss of DBY (DDX3) expression in the human testes and results in a complete lack of germ cells with preservation of somatic Sertoli cells. We found the hallmarks of mitotic G2 delay in early germ cells of the larval testes of bel mutants. Both mitotic cyclins, A and B, are markedly reduced in the gonads of bel mutants. Transcription levels of cycB and cycA decrease significantly in the testes of hypomorph bel mutants. Overexpression of Cyclin B in the germline partially rescues germ cell survival, mitotic progression and fertility in the bel-RNAi knockdown testes. Taken together, these results suggest that a role of Belle in GSC maintenance and regulation of early germ cell divisions is associated with the expression control of mitotic cyclins.

Abstract: Here we identified a hydrophobic 6.4kDa protein, Cox26, as a novel component of yeast mitochondrial supercomplex comprising respiratory complexes III and IV. Multi-dimensional native and denaturing electrophoretic techniques were used to identify proteins interacting with Cox26. The majority of the Cox26 protein was found non-covalently bound to the complex IV moiety of the III–IV supercomplexes. A population of Cox26 was observed to exist in a disulfide bond partnership with the Cox2 subunit of complex IV. No pronounced growth phenotype for Cox26 deficiency was observed, indicating that Cox26 may not play a critical role in the COX enzymology, and we speculate that Cox26 may serve to regulate or support the Cox2 protein. Respiratory supercomplexes are assembled in the absence of the Cox26 protein, however their pattern slightly differs to the wild type III–IV supercomplex appearance. The catalytic activities of complexes III and IV were observed to be normal and respiration was comparable to wild type as long as cells were cultivated under normal growth conditions. Stress conditions, such as elevated temperatures resulted in mild decrease of respiration in non-fermentative media when the Cox26 protein was absent.

Abstract: There is a growing evidence of the role of protein acetylation in different processes controlling metabolism. Sirtuins (histone deacetylases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent) activate autophagy playing a protective role in cell homeostasis. This study analyzes tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC2) lysine acetylation, in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling activation, autophagy and cell proliferation. Nicotinamide 5mM (a concentration commonly used to inhibit SIRT1), increased TSC2 acetylation in its N-terminal domain, and concomitantly with an augment in its ubiquitination protein status, leading to mTORC1 activation and cell proliferation. In contrast, resveratrol (RESV), an activator of sirtuins deacetylation activity, avoided TSC2 acetylation, inhibiting mTORC1 signaling and promoting autophagy. Moreover, TSC2 in its deacetylated state was prevented from ubiquitination. Using MEF Sirt1 +/+ and Sirt1 −/− cells or a SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527) in MIN6 cells, TSC2 was hyperacetylated and neither NAM nor RESV were capable to modulate mTORC1 signaling. Then, silencing Tsc2 in MIN6 or in MEF Tsc2−/− cells, the effects of SIRT1 modulation by NAM or RESV on mTORC1 signaling were abolished. We also observed that two TSC2 lysine mutants in its N-terminal domain, derived from TSC patients, differentially modulate mTORC1 signaling. TSC2 K599M variant presented a lower mTORC1 activity. However, with K106Q mutant, there was an activation of mTORC1 signaling at the basal state as well as in response to NAM. This study provides, for the first time, a relationship between TSC2 lysine acetylation status and its stability, representing a novel mechanism for regulating mTORC1 pathway.

Abstract: Peroxisomes are highly dynamic organelles that can rapidly change in size, abundance, and protein content in response to alterations in nutritional and other environmental conditions. These dynamic changes in peroxisome features, referred to as peroxisome dynamics, rely on the coordinated action of several processes of peroxisome biogenesis. Revealing the regulatory mechanisms of peroxisome dynamics is an emerging theme in cell biology. These mechanisms are inevitably linked to and synchronized with the biogenesis and degradation of peroxisomes. To date, the key players and basic principles of virtually all steps in the peroxisomal life cycle are known, but regulatory mechanisms remained largely elusive. A number of recent studies put the spotlight on reversible protein phosphorylation for the control of peroxisome dynamics and highlighted peroxisomes as hubs for cellular signal integration and regulation. Here, we will present and discuss the results of several studies performed using yeast and mammalian cells that convey a sense of the impact protein phosphorylation may have on the modulation of peroxisome dynamics by regulating peroxisomal matrix and membrane protein import, proliferation, inheritance, and degradation. We further put forward the idea to make use of current data on phosphorylation sites of peroxisomal and peroxisome-associated proteins reported in advanced large-scale phosphoproteomic studies.

Abstract: The physiological function of epithelia depends on an asymmetric distribution of their membrane domains. Polarity proteins play a crucial role for distribution processes, however, little is known about their mobility in epithelial cells. In this study, we analyzed the intracellular and plasma-membrane-associated mobility of fluorescence-labeled Crb3A and Crb3B. Both variants belong to the Crumbs protein family, which control size and identity of apical membranes in epithelial cells. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching measurements revealed different mobilities for the two Crb3 variants. They also differentially affected mobility and localization of the Pals1/Mpp5 protein, which binds to Crb3A but not to Crb3B. In addition, tracking of intracellular vesicles indicated that Crb3A containing vesicles are slightly more immobile than Crb3B ones. Taken together, our data revealed different intracellular mobility patterns for Crb3A and Crb3B.

Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transactivator protein Tat is known to play a key role in HIV infection, integrally related to its role in the host cell nucleus/nucleolus. Here we show for the first time that Tat localisation can be modulated by specific methylation, whereby overexpression of active but not catalytically inactive PRMT6 methyltransferase specifically leads to exclusion of Tat from the nucleolus. An R52/53A mutated Tat derivative does not show this redistribution, implying that R52/53, within Tat's nuclear/nucleolar localisation signal, are the targets of PRMT6 activity. Analysis using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicate that Tat nucleolar accumulation is largely through binding to nucleolar components, with methylation of Tat by PRMT6 preventing this. To our knowledge, this is the first report of specific protein methylation inhibiting nucleolar retention.

Abstract: Cell-based assays of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) using split reporter proteins can be used to identify PPI agonists and antagonists. Generally, such assays measure one PPI at a time, and thus counterscreens for on-target activity must be run in parallel or at a subsequent stage; this increases both the cost and time during screening. Split luciferase systems offer advantages over those that use split fluorescent proteins (FPs). This is since split luciferase offers a greater signal:noise ratio and, unlike split FPs, the PPI can be reversed upon small molecule treatment. While multiplexed PPI assays using luciferase have been reported, they suffer from low signal:noise and require fairly complex spectral deconvolution during analysis. Furthermore, the luciferase enzymes used are large, which limits the range of PPIs that can be interrogated due to steric hindrance from the split luciferase fragments. Here, we report a multiplexed PPI assay based on split luciferases from Photinus pyralis (firefly luciferase, FLUC) and the deep-sea shrimp, Oplophorus gracilirostris (NanoLuc, NLUC). Specifically, we show that the binding of the p53 tumor suppressor to its two major negative regulators, MDM2 and MDM4, can be simultaneously measured within the same sample, without the requirement for complex filters or deconvolution. We provide chemical and genetic validation of this system using MDM2-targeted small molecules and mutagenesis, respectively. Combined with the superior signal:noise and smaller size of split NanoLuc, this multiplexed PPI assay format can be exploited to study the induction or disruption of pairwise interactions that are prominent in many cell signaling pathways.

Abstract: Physiology of living beings show circadian rhythms entrained by a central timekeeper present in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei. Nevertheless, virtually all peripheral tissues hold autonomous molecular oscillators constituted essentially by circuits of gene expression that are organized in negative and positive feed-back loops. Accumulating evidence reveals that cell metabolism is rhythmically controlled by cell-intrinsic molecular clocks and the specific pathways involved are being elucidated. Here, we show that in vitro-synchronized cultured cells exhibit BMAL1-dependent oscillation in mitochondrial respiratory activity, which occurs irrespective of the cell type tested, the protocol of synchronization used and the carbon source in the medium. We demonstrate that the rhythmic respiratory activity is associated to oscillation in cellular NAD content and clock-genes-dependent expression of NAMPT and Sirtuins 1/3 and is traceable back to the reversible acetylation of a single subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I. Our findings provide evidence for a new interlocked transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop controlling the molecular interplay between cellular bioenergetics and the molecular clockwork.

Abstract: DOCK7 (dedicator of cytokinesis 7) is a guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 GTPase that is involved in neuronal polarity and axon generation as well in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. Recently, we identified DOCK7 as the binding partner of unconventional myosin VI (MVI) in neuronal-lineage PC12 cells and postulated that this interaction could be important in vivo [Majewski et al. (2012) Biochem Cell Biol., 90:565–574]. Herein, we found that MVI-DOCK7 interaction takes also place in other cell lines and demonstrated that MVI cargo domain via its RRL motif binds to DOCK7 C-terminal M2 and DHR2 domains. In MVI knockdown cells, lower Rac1 activity and a decrease of DOCK7 phosphorylation on Tyr1118 were observed, indicating that MVI could contribute to DOCK7 activity. MVI and DOCK7 co-localization was maintained during NGF-stimulated PC12 cell differentiation and observed also in the outgrowths. Also, during differentiation an increase in phosphorylation of DOCK7 as well as of its downstream effector JNK kinase was detected. Interestingly, overexpression of GFP-tagged MVI cargo domain (GFP-GT) impaired protrusion formation indicating that full length protein is important for this process. Moreover, a transient increase in Rac activity observed at 5min of NGF-stimulated differentiation of PC12 cells (overexpressing either GFP or GFP-MVI) was not detected in cells overexpressing the cargo domain. These data indicate that MVI-DOCK7 interaction could have functional implications in the protrusion outgrowth, and full length MVI seems to be important for delivery and maintenance of DOCK7 along the protrusions, and exerting its GEF activity.

Abstract: Biomechanics plays a critical role in the modulation of chondrocyte function. The mechanisms by which mechanical loading is transduced into intracellular signals that regulate chondrocyte gene expression remain largely unknown. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is specifically expressed in chondrocytes. Mice lacking HDAC4 display chondrocyte hypertrophy, ectopic and premature ossification, and die early during the perinatal period. HDAC4 has a remarkable ability to translocate between the cell's cytoplasm and nucleus. It has been established that subcellular relocation of HDAC4 plays a critical role in chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. However, it remains unclear whether subcellular relocation of HDAC4 in chondrocytes can be induced by mechanical loading. In this study, we first report that compressive loading induces HDAC4 relocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of chondrocytes via stimulation of Ser/Thr-phosphoprotein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) activity, which results in dephosphorylation of HDAC4. Dephosphorylated HDAC4 relocates to the nucleus to achieve transcriptional repression of Runx2 and regulates chondrocyte gene expression in response to compression. Our results elucidate the mechanism by which mechanical compression regulates chondrocyte gene expression through HDAC4 relocation from the cell's cytoplasm to the nucleus via PP2A-dependent HDAC4 dephosphorylation.

Abstract: Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the neuron-specific specificity protein 4 (Sp4) transcriptionally regulates many excitatory neurotransmitter receptor subunit genes, such as those for GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Gria2 of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. It also regulates Atp1a1 and Atp1b1 subunit genes of Na+/K+-ATPase, a major energy-consuming enzyme, as well as all 13 subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), an important energy-generating enzyme. Thus, there is a tight coupling between energy consumption, energy production, and excitatory neuronal activity at the transcriptional level in neurons. The question is whether inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors are also regulated by Sp4. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that Sp4 regulates receptor subunit genes of a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, specifically GABAA receptors. By means of multiple approaches, including in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, real-time quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter mutational analysis, over-expression and shRNA of Sp4, functional assays, and western blots, we found that Sp4 functionally regulates the transcription of Gabra1 (GABAA α1) and Gabra2 (GABAA α2), but not Gabra3 (GABAA α3) subunit genes. The binding sites of Sp4 are conserved among rats, humans, and mice. Thus, our results substantiate our hypothesis that Sp4 plays a key role in regulating the transcription of GABAA receptor subunit genes. They also indicate that Sp4 is in a position to transcriptionally regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurochemical expressions in neurons.

Abstract: Mutations in the PEX1 gene, which encodes a protein required for peroxisome biogenesis, are the most common cause of the Zellweger spectrum diseases. The recognition that Pex1p shares a conserved ATP-binding domain with p97 and NSF led to the discovery of the extended family of AAA+-type ATPases. So far, four AAA+-type ATPases are related to peroxisome function. Pex6p functions together with Pex1p in peroxisome biogenesis, ATAD1/Msp1p plays a role in membrane protein targeting and a member of the Lon-family of proteases is associated with peroxisomal quality control. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the AAA+-proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis and function.

Abstract: Binding of an odorant to olfactory receptors triggers cascades of second messenger systems in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Biochemical studies indicate that the transduction mechanism at ORNs is mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or inositol,1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3)-signaling pathways in an odorant-dependent manner. However, the interaction between these two second messenger systems during olfactory perception or adaptation processes is much less understood. Here, we used interfering-RNAi to disrupt the level of cAMP alone or in combination with the InsP3-signaling pathway cellular targets, InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) or ryanodine receptor (RyR) in ORNs, and quantify at ORN axon terminals in the antennal lobe, the odor-induced Ca2+-response. In-vivo functional bioluminescence Ca2+-imaging indicates that a single 5s application of an odor increased Ca2+-transients at ORN axon terminals. However, compared to wild-type controls, the magnitude and duration of ORN Ca2+-response was significantly diminished in cAMP-defective flies. In a behavioral assay, perception of odorants was defective in flies with a disrupted cAMP level suggesting that the ability of flies to correctly detect an odor depends on cAMP. Simultaneous disruption of cAMP level and InsP3R or RyR further diminished the magnitude and duration of ORN response to odorants and affected the flies' ability to detect an odor. In conclusion, this study provides functional evidence that cAMP and InsP3-signaling pathways act in synergy to mediate odor processing within the ORN axon terminals, which is encoded in the magnitude and duration of ORN response.

Abstract: The NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular multi-protein complex controlling the maturation of cytokine interleukin-1β, plays an important role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cascades. Recently, the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in macrophages stimulated with LPS has been suggested to act as a trigger during the process of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that can be blocked by some mitochondria-targeted antioxidants. Known as a ROS scavenger, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been shown to possess therapeutic benefit on LPS-induced inflammatory damage in many animal experiments. Due to the unique molecular structure, H2 can easily target the mitochondria, suggesting that H2 is a potential antagonist of mtROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here we have showed that, in mouse macrophages, H2 exhibited substantial inhibitory activity against LPS-initiated NLRP3 inflammasome activation by scavenging mtROS. Moreover, the elimination of mtROS by H2 resultantly inhibited mtROS-mediated NLRP3 deubiquitination, a non-transcriptional priming signal of NLRP3 in response to the stimulation of LPS. Additionally, the removal of mtROS by H2 reduced the generation of oxidized mitochondrial DNA and consequently decreased its binding to NLRP3, thereby inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings have, for the first time, revealed the novel mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of molecular hydrogen on LPS-caused NLRP3 inflammasome activation, highlighting the promising application of this new antioxidant in the treatment of LPS-associated inflammatory pathological damage.

Abstract: Very recent studies hold promise to reveal the role of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in non-store-operated Ca2+ entry. Here we showed that in contrast to cytoplasmic membrane redistribution as previously noted, human umbilical vein endothelial STIM1 with a T-to-C nucleotide transition resulting in an amino acid substitution of leucine by proline in the signal peptide sequence translocated to perinuclear membrane upon intracellular Ca2+ depletion, amplified nucleoplasmic Ca2+ signaling through ryanodine receptor-dependent pathway, and enhanced the subsequent cAMP responsive element binding protein activity, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene expression, and endothelial tube forming. The abundance of mutated STIM1 and the MMP-2 expression were higher in native human umbilical vein endothelial cells of patients with gestational hypertension than controls and were significantly correlated with blood pressure. These findings broaden our understanding about structure–function bias of STIM1 and offer unique insights into its application in nucleoplasmic Ca2+, MMP-2 expression, endothelial dysfunction, and pathophysiological mechanism(s) of gestational hypertension.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognise invading pathogens and initiate an innate immune response by recruiting intracellular adaptor proteins via heterotypic Toll/interleukin­1 receptor (TIR) domain interactions. Of the five TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins identified, Sterile α­ and armadillo­motif­containing protein (SARM) is functionally unique; suppressing immune signalling instead of promoting it. Here we demonstrate that the recombinantly expressed and purified SARM TIR domain interacts with both the major human TLR adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. A single glycine residue located in the BB-loop of the SARM TIR domain, G601, was identified as essential for interaction. A short peptide derived from this motif was also found to interact with MyD88 in vitro. SARM expression in HEK293 cells was found to significantly suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-α, an effect lost in the G601A mutant. The same result was observed with cytokine activation initiated by MyD88 expression and stimulation of TLR2 with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), suggesting that SARM is capable of suppressing both TRIF- and MyD88- dependent TLR signalling. Our findings indicate that SARM acts on a broader set of target proteins than previously thought, and that the BB-loop motif is functionally important, giving further insight into the endogenous mechanisms used to suppress inflammation in immune cells.

Abstract: ABCG2 is one of three human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the export from cells of a chemically and structurally diverse range of compounds. This multidrug efflux capability, together with a broad tissue distribution in the body, means that ABCG2 exerts a range of effects on normal physiology such as kidney urate transport, as well as contributing towards the pharmacokinetic profiles of many exogenous drugs. The primary sequence of ABCG2 contains only half the number of domains required for a functioning ABC transporter and so it must oligomerise in order to function, yet its oligomeric state in intact cell membranes remains uncharacterized. We have analysed ABCG2 in living cell membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, and stepwise photobleaching to demonstrate a predominantly tetrameric structure for ABCG2 in the presence or absence of transport substrates. These results provide the essential basis for exploring pharmacological manipulation of oligomeric state as a strategy to modulate ABCG2 activity in future selective therapeutics.

Abstract: Aging is a major factor predisposing for multiple diseases. Telomeres at the ends of chromosomes protect the integrity of chromosomal DNA. A specialized six-protein complex termed shelterin protects the telomere from unwanted interaction with DNA damage pathways. The aim of our study was to evaluate the integrity of telomeres and the stability of telomere protection during aging in endothelial cells (EC). We describe that aging EC can be characterized by an increased cell size (40%, p=0.02) and increased expression of PAI 1 (4 fold, p=0.02), MCP1 (10 fold, p=0.001) and GMCSF (15 fold, p=0.004). Telomeric state in aging cells is defined by an increased telomere oxidation (27%, p=0.01), reduced telomere length (62%, p=0.02), and increased DNA damage foci formation (5% in young EC versus 16% in aged EC, p=0.003). This telomeric dysfunction is accompanied by a reduction in the shelterin component TRF1 (33% mRNA, p=0.001; 24% protein, p=0.007). Overexpression of TRF1 in aging EC reduced telomere-associated DNA damage foci to 5% (p=0.02) and reduced expression levels of MCP1 (18% reduction, p=0.008). Aged EC have increased telomere damage and an intrinsic loss of telomere protection. Reestablishing telomere integrity could therefore be a target for rejuvenating endothelial cell function.

Abstract: In this review we discuss the structure and functions of the aspartate/glutamate carriers (AGC1-aralar and AGC2-citrin). Those proteins supply the aspartate synthesized within mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol in exchange for glutamate and a proton. A structure of an AGC carrier is not available yet but comparative 3D models were proposed. Moreover, transport assays performed by using the recombinant AGC1 and AGC2, reconstituted into liposome vesicles, allowed to explore the kinetics of those carriers and to reveal their specific transport properties. AGCs participate to a wide range of cellular functions, as the control of mitochondrial respiration, calcium signaling and antioxydant defenses. AGC1 might also play peculiar tissue-specific functions, as it was found to participate to cell-to-cell metabolic symbiosis in the retina. On the other hand, AGC1 is involved in the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neurons and AGC gene or protein alterations were discovered in rare human diseases. Accordingly, a mice model of AGC1 gene knock-out presented with growth delay and generalized tremor, with myelinisation defects. More recently, AGC was proposed to play a crucial role in tumor metabolism as observed from metabolomic studies showing that the asparate exported from the mitochondrion by AGC1 is employed in the regeneration of cytosolic glutathione. Therefore, given the central role of AGCs in cell metabolism and human pathology, drug screening are now being developed to identify pharmacological modulators of those carriers.

Negative pressure induces p120-catenin–dependent adherens junction disassembly in keratinocytes during wound healing,

Abstract: A negative-pressure of 125mmHg (NP) has been widely used to treat chronic wounds in modern medicine. Keratinocytes under NP treatment have shown accelerated cell movement and decreased E-cadherin expression. However, the molecular mechanism of E-cadherin regulation under NP remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we investigated the E-cadherin regulation in keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) under NP. HaCaT cells were treated at ambient pressure (AP) and NP for 12h. Cell movement was measured by traditional and electric wound healing assays at the 2 different pressures. Mutants with overexpression of p120-catenin (p120ctn) were used to observe the effect of NP on p120ctn and E-cadherin expression during wound healing. Cell fractionation and immunoblotting data showed that NP increased Y228-phosphorylated p120ctn level and resulted in the translocation of p120ctn from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence images revealed that NP decreased the co-localization of p120ctn and E-cadherin on the plasma membrane. Knockdown of p120ctn reduced E-cadherin expression and accelerated cell movement under AP. Overexpression of the Y228-phosphorylation-mimic p120ctn decreased E-cadherin membrane expression under both AP and NP. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants conferred restored adherens junctions (AJs) under NP. The Src inhibitor blocked the phosphorylation of p120ctn and impeded cell migration under NP. In conclusion, Src-dependent phosphorylation of p120ctn can respond rapidly to NP and contribute to E-cadherin downregulation. The NP-induced disassembly of the AJ further accelerates wound healing.

Coordinate regulation of microenvironmental stimuli and role of methylation in bone metastasis from breast carcinoma,

Abstract: The pathogenesis of bone metastasis is unclear, and much focus in metastatic biology and therapy relays on epigenetic alterations. Since DNA-methyltransferase blockade with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (dAza) counteracts tumour growth, here we utilized dAza to clarify whether molecular events undergoing epigenetic control were critical for bone metastatization. In particular, we investigated the patterns of secreted-protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and of Endothelin 1, affected by DNA methyltransferases in tumours, with the hypothesis that in bone metastasis a coordinate function of SPARC and Endothelin 1, if any occurs, was orchestrated by DNA methylation. To this purpose, we prepared a xenograft model with the clone 1833, derived from human-MDA-MB231 cells, and dAza administration slowed-down metastasis outgrowth. This seemed consequent to the reductions of SPARC and Endothelin 1 at invasive front and in the bone marrow, mostly due to loss of Twist. In the metastasis bulk Snail, partly reduced by dAza, might sustain Endothelin 1-SPARC cooperativity. Both SPARC and Endothelin 1 underwent post-translational control by miRNAs, a molecular mechanism that might explain the in vivo data. Ectopic miR29a reduced SPARC expression also under long-term dAza exposure, while Endothelin 1 down-regulation occurred in the presence of endogenous-miR98 expression. Notably, dAza effects differed depending on in vivo and in vitro conditions. In 1833 cells exposed to 30-days dAza, SPARC-protein level was practically unaffected, while Endothelin 1 induction depended on the 3′-UTR functionality. The blockade of methyltransferases leading to SPARC reduction in vivo, might represent a promising strategy to hamper early steps of the metastatic process affecting the osteogenic niche.

Abstract: This review discusses historical milestones, recent developments and challenges in the area of 3D culture models with cardiovascular cell types. Expectations in this area have been raised in recent years, but more relevant in vitro research, more accurate drug testing results, reliable disease models and insights leading to bioartificial organs are expected from the transition to 3D cell culture. However, the construction of organ-like cardiac 3D models currently remains a difficult challenge. The heart consists of highly differentiated cells in an intricate arrangement. Furthermore, electrical “wiring”, a vascular system and multiple cell types act in concert to respond to the rapidly changing demands of the body. Although cardiovascular 3D culture models have been predominantly developed for regenerative medicine in the past, their use in drug screening and for disease models has become more popular recently. Many sophisticated 3D culture models are currently being developed in this dynamic area of life science.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is essential for increased invasion and metastasis during cancer progression. Among the candidate EMT-regulating microRNAs that we previously identified, miR-181b-3p was found to induce EMT in MCF7 breast cancer cells, as indicated by an EMT-characteristic morphological change, increased invasiveness, and altered expression of an EMT marker. Transfection with a miR-181b-3p inhibitor reduced the expression of mesenchymal markers and the migration and invasion of highly invasive breast cancer cells. miR-181b-3p induced the upregulation of Snail, a master EMT inducer and transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, through protein stabilization. YWHAG was identified as a direct target of miR-181b-3p, downregulation of which induced Snail stabilization and EMT phenotypes. Ectopic expression of YWHAG abrogated the effect of miR-181b-3p, including Snail stabilization and the promotion of invasion. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that YWHAG expression was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-181b-3p and Snail in human breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, transfection with miR-181b-3p increased the frequency of metastatic nodule formation in the lungs of mice in experimental metastasis assays using MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-181b-3p functions as a metastasis activator by promoting Snail-induced EMT, and may therefore be a therapeutic target in metastatic cancers.

Abstract: The most prominent factor that delays the translation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analyses to clinical practice is the lack of knowledge regarding its origin and composition. The elucidation of the former is complicated by the seemingly random fluctuation of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cfDNA in the blood of healthy and diseased individuals. Besides methodological discrepancies, this could be ascribed to a web of cellular responses to various environmental cues and stressors. Since all cells release cfDNA, it follows that the cfDNA in the blood of cancer patients is not only representative of tumor derived DNA, but also of DNA released by healthy cells under different conditions. Additionally, cfDNA released by malignant cells is not necessarily just aberrant, but likely includes non-mutated chromosomal DNA fragments. This may cause false positive/negative results. Although many have acknowledged that this is a major problem, few have addressed it. We propose that many of the current stumbling blocks encountered in in vivo cfDNA studies can be partially circumvented by in vitro models. Accordingly, the purpose of this work was to evaluate the release of cfDNA from cultured cells and to gauge its potential use for elucidating the nature of cfDNA. Results suggest that the occurrence of cfDNA is not a consequence of apoptosis or necrosis, but primarily a result of actively secreted DNA, perhaps in association with a protein complex. This study demonstrates the potential of in vitro cell culture models to obtain useful information about the phenomenon of cfDNA.

Abstract: While it is a relatively rare disease, glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is one of the more deadly adult cancers. Following current interventions, the tumor is never eliminated whatever the treatment performed; whether it is radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. One hypothesis to explain this poor outcome is the “cancer stem cell” hypothesis. This concept proposes that a minority of cells within the tumor mass share many of the properties of adult neural stem cells and it is these that are responsible for the growth of the tumor and its resistance to existing therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that Ca2+ might also be an important positive regulator of tumorigenesis in GBM, in processes involving quiescence, maintenance, proliferation, or migration. Glioblastoma tumors are generally thought to develop by co-opting pathways that are involved in the formation of an organ. We propose that the cells initiating the tumor, and subsequently the cells of the tumor mass, must hijack the different checkpoints that evolution has selected in order to prevent the pathological development of an organ. In this article, two main points are discussed. (i) The first is the establishment of a so-called “cellular society,” which is required to create a favorable microenvironment. (ii) The second is that GBM can be considered to be an organism, which fights to survive and develop. Since GBM evolves in a limited space, its only chance of development is to overcome the evolutionary checkpoints. For example, the deregulation of the normal Ca2+ signaling elements contributes to the progression of the disease. Thus, by manipulating the Ca2+ signaling, the GBM cells might not be killed, but might be reprogrammed toward a new fate that is either easy to cure or that has no aberrant functioning.

Abstract: The Tat system transports folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane, and in Escherichia coli preferentially transports correctly-folded proteins. Little is known of the mechanism by which Tat proofreads a substrate's conformational state, and in this study we have addressed this question using a heterologous single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with a defined structure. We introduced mutations to surface residues while leaving the folded structure intact, and also tested the importance of conformational flexibility. We show that while the scFv is stably folded and active in the reduced form, formation of the 2 intra-domain disulphide bonds enhances Tat-dependent export 10-fold, indicating Tat senses the conformational flexibility and preferentially exports the more rigid structure. We further show that a 26-residue unstructured tail at the C-terminus blocks export, suggesting that even this short sequence can be sensed by the proofreading system. In contrast, the Tat system can tolerate significant changes in charge or hydrophobicity on the scFv surface; substitution of uncharged residues by up to 3 Lys-Glu pairs has little effect, as has the introduction of up to 5 Lys or Glu residues in a confined domain, or the introduction of a patch of 4 to 6 Leu residues in a hydrophilic region. We propose that the proofreading system has evolved to sense conformational flexibility and detect even very transiently-exposed internal regions, or the presence of unfolded peptide sections. In contrast, it tolerates major changes in surface charge or hydrophobicity.

Abstract: Peroxisomes are dynamic organelles that play an essential role in a variety of cellular catabolic and anabolic metabolic pathways, including fatty acid alpha- and beta-oxidation, and plasmalogen and bile acid synthesis. Defects in genes encoding peroxisomal proteins can result in a large variety of peroxisomal disorders either affecting specific metabolic pathways, i.e., the single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies, or causing a generalized defect in function and assembly of peroxisomes, i.e., peroxisome biogenesis disorders. In this review, we discuss the clinical, biochemical, and genetic aspects of all human peroxisomal disorders currently known.

Abstract: The regulatory roles for non-coding RNAs, the long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, are emerging as crucial determinants of central nervous system development and function. Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) is a cell adhesion molecule that has been shown to play an important role in neurite outgrowth during neuronal development. Precise expression of the Negr1 gene is crucial for proper brain development and is dysregulated during brain injury. Hence, we attempted to elucidate the non-coding RNAs that control Negr1 gene expression. A long non-coding RNA, BC048612, transcribed from the bidirectional GC-rich Negr1 gene promoter was found to influence Negr1 mRNA expression. In vitro knockdown of the long non-coding RNA resulted in significant down-regulation of Negr1 mRNA expression, NEGR1 protein levels and neurite length whereas over-expression enhanced Negr1 mRNA expression, NEGR1 protein levels and increased neurite length. Meanwhile, another non-coding RNA, microRNA-203, was found to target the 3′ untranslated region of the Negr1 mRNA. Inhibition of microRNA-203 led to increased expression of Negr1 mRNA, elevated NEGR1 protein levels and increased neurite length. Conversely, microRNA-203 over-expression decreased the level of Negr1 mRNA, NEGR1 protein and neurite length. Neither microRNA-203 nor the long non-coding RNA, BC048612 could influence each other's expression. Hence, the long non-coding RNA, BC048612, and microRNA-203 were determined to be positive and negative regulators of Negr1 gene expression respectively. These processes have a direct effect on NEGR1 protein levels and neurite length, thus highlighting the importance of the regulatory non-coding RNAs in modulating Negr1 gene expression for precise neuronal development.

Abstract: Cardiac drug discovery is hampered by the reliance on non-human animal and cellular models with inadequate throughput and physiological fidelity to accurately identify new targets and test novel therapeutic strategies. Similarly, adverse drug effects on the heart are challenging to model, contributing to costly failure of drugs during development and even after market launch. Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac tissue represents a potentially powerful means to model aspects of heart physiology relevant to disease and adverse drug effects, providing both the human context and throughput needed to improve the efficiency of drug development. Here we review emerging technologies for high throughput measurements of cardiomyocyte physiology, and comment on the promises and challenges of using iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to model disease and introduce the human context into early stages of drug discovery.

Abstract: Here, we review the role of Ca2+ in apoptosis, namely that ER Ca2+ depletion or a sustained elevation of cytosolic or mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration are sufficient to trigger apoptosis. These concepts have emerged by the use of ER stressor agents that decrease the ER Ca2+ pool by inhibiting SERCA pumps. However, aside from their well-known actions on Ca2+ homeostasis disruption leading to apoptosis, new evidence show that some ER Ca2+ modulators have significant implications in other Ca2+-mediated or Ca2+-independent pathways determining cell fate suggesting a more complex regulation of apoptosis by intracellular Ca2+. Here, we discuss the crucial interplay between Ca2+ mediated apoptosis, the Unfold Protein Response and autophagy determining cell fate, and the molecular compounds that have been used to depict these pathways. This review of the literature clearly shows the need for new inhibitors that do not interfere concomitantly with autophagy and Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The peroxisomal compartment in hepatocytes hosts several essential metabolic conversions. These are defective in peroxisomal disorders that are either caused by failure to import the enzymes in the organelle or by mutations in the enzymes or in transporters needed to transfer the substrates across the peroxisomal membrane. Hepatic pathology is one of the cardinal features in disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisomal β-oxidation although it only rarely determines the clinical fate. In mouse models of these diseases liver pathologies also occur, although these are not always concordant with the human phenotype which might be due to differences in diet, expression of enzymes and backup mechanisms. Besides the morphological changes, we overview the impact of peroxisome malfunction on other cellular compartments including mitochondria and the ER. We further focus on the metabolic pathways that are affected such as bile acid formation, and dicarboxylic acid and branched chain fatty acid degradation. It appears that the association between deregulated metabolites and pathological events remains unclear. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: The angiotensin II type I receptor (AGTR1) has been implicated in diverse aspects of human disease, from the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis to cancer progression. We sought to investigate the role of AGTR1 in cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth in the breast cancer cell line MCF7. Stable overexpression of AGTR1 was associated with accelerated cell proliferation, concomitant with increased expression of survival factors including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. AGTR1-overexpressing MCF7 cells were more aggressive than their parent line, with significantly increased activity in migration and invasion assays. These observations were associated with changes in EMT markers, including reduced E-cadherin expression and increased p-Smad3, Smad4 and Snail levels. Treatment with the AGTR1 antagonist losartan attenuated these effects. AGTR1 overexpression also accelerated tumor growth and increased Ki-67 expression in a xenograft model. This was associated with increased tumor angiogenesis, as evidenced by a significant increase in microvessels in the intratumoral and peritumoral areas, and enhanced tumor invasion, with the latter response associated with increased EMT marker expression and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) upregulation. In vivo administration of losartan significantly reduced both tumor growth and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Galectin 3 (LGALS3) expression is prognostic for poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. GCS-100 is a novel galectin inhibitor that may prove useful for AML therapy. In this study, we found that GCS-100 induced apoptosis in AML cells. The agent reduced MCL-1 expression suggesting that GCS-100 could be more effective when combined with a BH3 mimetic. Indeed, potent synergistic cytotoxicity was achieved when GCS-100 was combined with ABT-737 or ABT-199. Furthermore, the GCS-100/ABT-199 combination was effective against primary AML blast cells from patients with FLT3 ITD mutations, which is another prognostic factor for poor outcome in AML. This activity may involve wild-type p53 as shRNA knockdown of LGALS3 or galectin 1 (LGALS1) sensitized wild-type p53 OCI-AML3 cells to GCS-100/ABT-737-induced apoptosis to a much greater extent than p53 null THP-1 cells. Suppression of LGALS3 by shRNA inhibited MCL-1 expression in OCI-AML3 cells, but not THP-1 cells, suggesting the induced sensitivity to ABT-737 may involve a MCL-1 mediated mechanism. OCI-AML3 cells with LGALS1 shRNA were also sensitized to ABT-737. However, these cells exhibited increased MCL-1 expression, so MCL-1 reduction is apparently not required in this process. A role for p53 appears important as GCS-100 induces p53 expression and shRNA knockdown of p53 protected OCI-AML3 cells from the cytotoxic effects of the GCS-100/ABT-737 treatment combination. Our results suggest that galectins regulate a survival axis in AML cells, which may be targeted via combined inhibition with drugs such as GCS-100 and ABT-199.

Abstract: Regenerating an injured heart holds great promise for millions of patients suffering from heart diseases. Since the human heart has very limited regenerative capacity, this is a challenging task. Numerous strategies aiming to improve heart function have been developed. In this review we focus on approaches intending to replace damaged heart muscle by new cardiomyocytes. Different strategies for the production of cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells, by direct reprogramming and induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation are discussed regarding their therapeutic potential and respective advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, different methods for the transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are described and their clinical perspectives are discussed.

Abstract: Posttranslational modifications including histone methylation regulate gene transcription through directly affecting the structure of chromatin. Trimethylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) contributes to gene silencing and the histone demethylase Jumonji domain-containing 3 (Jmjd3) specifically removes the methylation of H3K27me3, followed by the activation of gene expression. In the present study, we explored the roles of Jmjd3 in regulating osteoblast apoptosis. Knockdown of Jmjd3 promoted osteoblast apoptosis induced by serum deprivation with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), an anti-apoptotic protein, was down-regulated by knockdown of Jmjd3 through retaining H3K27me3 on its promoter region. Knockdown of Jmjd3 increased the pro-apoptotic activity of Bim through inhibiting ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Bim. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1), which stimulates ERK phosphorylation, decreased in the Jmjd3-knockdown cells and introduction of PKD1 relieved osteoblast apoptosis in the Jmjd3-knockdown cells through increasing ERK-regulated Bim phosphorylation. These results suggest that Jmjd3 regulates osteoblast apoptosis through targeting Bcl-2 expression and Bim phosphorylation.

Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (Gpd1) and nicotinamidase (Pnc1) are two stress-induced enzymes. Both enzymes are predominantly localised to peroxisomes at normal growth conditions, but were reported to localise to the cytosol and nucleus upon exposure of cells to stress. Import of both proteins into peroxisomes depends on the peroxisomal targeting signal 2 (PTS2) receptor Pex7. Gpd1 contains a PTS2, however, Pnc1 lacks this sequence. Here we show that Pnc1 physically interacts with Gpd1, which is required for piggy-back import of Pnc1 into peroxisomes. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed that the levels of both proteins increased in peroxisomes and in the cytosol upon exposure of cells to stress. However, upon exposure of cells to stress we also observed enhanced cytosolic levels of the control PTS2 protein thiolase, when produced under control of the GPD1 promoter. This suggests that these conditions cause a partial defect in PTS2 protein import, probably because the PTS2 import pathway is easily saturated.

Abstract: Besides genetic abnormalities in MPN patients, several studies have reported alterations in protein expression that could contribute towards the clinical phenotype. However, little is known about protein modifications in Ph− MPN erythrocytes. In this context, we used a quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics approach to study the MPN erythrocyte proteome. LC-MS/MS (LTQ Orbitrap) analysis led to the identification of 51 and 86 overexpressed proteins in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia respectively, compared with controls. Functional comparison using pathway analysis software showed that the Rho GTPase family signaling pathways were deregulated in MPN patients. In particular, IQGAP1 was significantly overexpressed in MPNs compared with controls. Additionally, Western-blot analysis not only confirmed IQGAP1 overexpression, but also showed that IQGAP1 levels depended on the patient's genotype. Moreover, we found that in JAK2V617F patients IQGAP1 could bind RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 and consequently recruit activated GTP-Rac1 and the cytoskeleton motility protein PAK1. In CALR(+) patients, IQGAP1 was not overexpressed but immunoprecipitated with RhoGDI. In JAK2V617F transduced Ba/F3 cells we confirmed JAK2 inhibitor-sensitive overexpression of IQGAP1/PAK1. Altogether, our data demonstrated alterations of IQGAP1/Rho GTPase signaling in MPN erythrocytes dependent on JAK2/CALR status, reinforcing the hypothesis that modifications in erythrocyte signaling pathways participate in Ph− MPN pathogenesis.

Abstract: Dynamic changes in spindle structure and function are essential for maintaining genomic integrity during the cell cycle. Spindle dynamics are highly dependent on several microtubule-associated proteins that coordinate the dynamic behavior of microtubules, including microtubule assembly, stability and organization. Here, we show that translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a novel microtubule-associated protein that regulates spindle dynamics during meiotic maturation. TCTP was expressed and widely distributed in the cytoplasm with strong enrichment at the spindle microtubules during meiosis. TCTP was found to be phosphorylated during meiotic maturation, and was exclusively localized to the spindle poles. Knockdown of TCTP impaired spindle organization without affecting chromosome alignment. These spindle defects were mostly due to the destabilization of the polar microtubules. However, the stability of kinetochore microtubules attached to chromosomes was not affected by TCTP knockdown. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylable mutant of TCTP disturbed meiotic maturation, stabilizing the spindle microtubules. In addition, Plk1 was decreased by TCTP knockdown. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TCTP is a microtubule-associating protein required to regulate spindle microtubule dynamics during meiotic maturation in mouse oocytes.

Abstract: NF-Y is a heterotrimeric transcription factor, which plays a pioneer role in the transcriptional control of promoters containing the CCAAT-box, among which genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and DNA damage response. The knock-down of the sequence-specific subunit NF-YA triggers defects in S-phase progression, which lead to apoptotic cell death. Here, we report that NF-Y has a critical function in DNA replication progression, independent from its transcriptional activity. NF-YA colocalizes with early DNA replication factories, its depletion affects the loading of replisome proteins to DNA, among which Cdc45, and delays the passage from early to middle-late S phase. Molecular combing experiments are consistent with a role for NF-Y in the control of fork progression. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrate a direct non-transcriptional role of NF-Y in the overall efficiency of DNA replication, specifically in the DNA elongation process, using a Xenopus cell-free system. Our findings broaden the activity of NF-Y on a DNA metabolism other than transcription, supporting the existence of specific TFs required for proper and efficient DNA replication.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs-CMs) could revolutionise biomedicine. Global burden of heart failure will soon reach USD $90bn, while unexpected cardiotoxicity underlies 28% of drug withdrawals. Advances in hPSC isolation, Cas9/CRISPR genome engineering and hPSC-CM differentiation have improved patient care, progressed drugs to clinic and opened a new era in safety pharmacology. Nevertheless, predictive cardiotoxicity using hPSC-CMs contrasts from failure to almost total success. Since this likely relates to cell immaturity, efforts are underway to use biochemical and biophysical cues to improve many of the ~30 structural and functional properties of hPSC-CMs towards those seen in adult CMs. Other developments needed for widespread hPSC-CM utility include subtype specification, cost reduction of large scale differentiation and elimination of the phenotyping bottleneck. This review will consider these factors in the evolution of hPSC-CM technologies, as well as their integration into high content industrial platforms that assess structure, mitochondrial function, electrophysiology, calcium transients and contractility.

Abstract: Alveolar mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in mammary glands are highly specialized cells that produce milk for suckling infants. Alveolar MECs also form less permeable tight junctions (TJs) to prevent the leakage of milk components after parturition. In the formation process of less permeable TJs, MECs show a selective downregulation of Cldn4 and a localization change of Cldn3. To investigate what induces less permeable TJs through these compositional changes in Cldns, we focused on two lactogenesis-related hormones: prolactin (Prl) and glucocorticoids. Prl caused a downregulation of Cldn3 and Cldn4 with the formation of leaky TJs in MECs in vitro. Prl-treated MECs also showed low β-casein expression with the activation of STAT5 signaling. By contrast, dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid analogue, upregulated Cldn3 and Cldn4, concurrent with the formation of less permeable TJs and the activation of glucocorticoid signaling without the expression of β-casein. Cotreatment with Prl and Dex induced the selective downregulation of Cldn4 and the concentration of Cldn3 in the region of TJs concurrent with less permeable TJ formation and high β-casein expression. The inhibition of Prl secretion by bromocriptine in lactating mice induced the upregulation of Cldn3 and Cldn4 concurrent with the downregulation of milk production. These results indicate that the coactivation of Prl and glucocorticoid signaling induces lactation-specific less permeable TJs concurrent with lactogenesis.

Abstract: All cells are delimited by biological membranes, which are consequently a primary target of stress-induced damage. Cold alters membrane functionality by decreasing lipid fluidity and the activity of membrane proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, evidence links sphingolipid homeostasis and membrane phospholipid asymmetry to the activity of the Ypk1/2 proteins, the yeast orthologous of the mammalian SGK1–3 kinases. Their regulation is mediated by different protein kinases, including the PDK1 orthologous Pkh1/2p, and requires the function of protein effectors, among them Nce102p, a component of the sphingolipid sensor machinery. Nevertheless, the mechanisms and the actors involved in Pkh/Ypk regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Sng1, a transmembrane protein, is an effector of the Pkh/Ypk module and identify the phospholipid asymmetry as key for yeast cold adaptation. Overexpression of SNG1 impairs phospholipid flipping, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improves, in a Pkh-dependent manner, yeast growth in myriocin-treated cells, suggesting that excess Sng1p stimulates the Pkh/Ypk signalling. Furthermore, we link these effects to the association of Sng1p with Nce102p. Indeed, we found that Sng1p interacts with Nce102p both physically and genetically. Moreover, mutant nce102∆ sng1∆ cells show features of impaired Pkh/Ypk signalling, including increased ROS accumulation, reduced life span and defects in Pkh/Ypk-controlled regulatory pathways. Finally, myriocin-induced hyperphosphorylation of Ypk1p and Orm2p, which controls sphingolipid homeostasis, does not occur in nce102∆ sng1∆ cells. Hence, both Nce102p and Sng1p participate in a regulatory circuit that controls the activity of the Pkh/Ypk module and their function is required in response to sphingolipid status.

Abstract: The correct topogenesis of peroxisomal membrane proteins is a crucial step for the formation of functioning peroxisomes. Although this process has been widely studied, the exact mechanism with which it occurs has not yet been fully characterized. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that peroxisomes employ three proteins – Pex3, Pex19 and Pex16 in mammals – for the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins into the peroxisomal membrane. Structural biology approaches have been utilized for the elucidation of the mechanistic questions of peroxisome biogenesis, mainly by providing information on the architecture of the proteins significant for this process. This review aims to summarize, compare and put into perspective the structural knowledge that has been generated mainly for Pex3 and Pex19 and their interaction partners in recent years. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: Nephrotoxicity, particularly in the proximal tubule, limits the therapeutic efficacy of the antineoplastic drug cisplatin. The signaling mechanisms appear to be multifactorial, involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and caspase. Here we studied the role of intracellular prostaglandin E2 (iPGE2) in cisplatin's cytotoxicity in human proximal tubular HK-2 cells. Cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death was prevented by inhibitors of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) or by PGT knock-down or by pharmacologic inhibition of PGE2 EP receptors or cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). iPGE2 also increased in cisplatin-treated cells, which was probably due to increased expression of COX-2, microsomal PGE2 synthase-1 and PGT, and was prevented by inhibitors of PGT or COX-2. Thus iPGE2, most likely acting through intracellular EP receptors, mediates cisplatin-induced HK-2 cell death. Importantly, the tumoricidal effect of cisplatin on human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells was not affected by a pharmacologic inhibitor of PGT. In conclusion, iPGE2 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of cisplatin’s nephrotoxicity and treatment with PGT inhibitors might represent a novel strategy in its prevention.

Abstract: Besides their importance for the vascular tone, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) also contribute to pathophysiological vessel alterations. Various G-protein coupled receptor ligands involved in vascular dysfunction and remodeling can transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of VSMC, yet the importance of EGFR transactivation for the VSMC phenotype is incompletely understood. The aims of this study were (i) to characterize further the importance of the VSMC-EGFR for proliferation, migration and marker gene expression for inflammation, fibrosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and (ii) to test the hypothesis that vasoactive substances (endothelin-1, phenylephrine, thrombin, vasopressin and ATP) rely differentially on the EGFR with respect to the abovementioned phenotypic alterations. In primary, aortic VSMC from mice without conditional deletion of the EGFR, proliferation, migration, marker gene expression (inflammation, fibrosis and ROS homeostasis) and cell signaling (ERK 1/2, intracellular calcium) were analyzed. VSMC-EGFR loss reduced collective cell migration and single cell migration probability, while no difference between the genotypes in single cell velocity, chemotaxis or marker gene expression could be observed under control conditions. EGF promoted proliferation, collective cell migration, chemokinesis and chemotaxis and leads to a proinflammatory gene expression profile in wildtype but not in knockout VSMC. Comparing the impact of five vasoactive substances (all reported to transactivate EGFR and all leading to an EGFR dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation), we demonstrate that the importance of EGFR for their action is substance-dependent and most apparent for crowd migration but plays a minor role for gene expression regulation.

Abstract: The transcription factor ERG is known to have divergent roles. On one hand, it acts as differentiation factor of endothelial cells. On the other hand, it has pathological roles in various cancers. Genomic analyses of the ERG gene show that it gives rise to several isoforms. However, functional differences between these isoforms, representing potential reasons for distinct effects in diverse cell types have not been addressed in detail so far. We set out to investigate the major protein isoforms and found that ERG8 contains a unique C-terminus. This isoform, when expressed as GFP-fusion protein, localized mainly to the cytosol, whereas the other major isoforms (ERG1-4) were predominantly nuclear. Using site directed mutagenesis and laser scanning microscopy of live cells, we could identify nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export sequences (NES). These analyses indicated that ERG8 lacks a classical NLS and the DNA-binding domain, but holds an additional NES within its distinctive C-terminus. All the tested isoforms were shuttling between nucleus and cytosol and showed a high degree of mobility. ERG's 1 to 4 were transcriptionally active on ERG-promoter elements whereas ERG8 was inactive, which is in line with the absence of a DNA-binding domain. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy revealed that ERG8 can bind to the transcriptionally active ERG's. Knockdown of ERG8 in endothelial cells resulted in upregulation of endogenous ERG-transcriptional activity implying ERG8 as an inhibitor of the active ERG isoforms. Quantitative PCR revealed a different ratio of active ERG's to ERG8 in cancer- versus non-transformed cells.

Abstract: Coronary atherosclerosis complicated by plaque disruption and thrombosis is a critical event in myocardial infarction and stroke, the major causes of cardiovascular death. In atherogenesis, macrophages (MAC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) are key actors; they synthesize matrix components and numerous factors involved in the process. Here, we design experiments to investigate whether SMC–MAC communication induces changes in ECM protein composition and/or neo-angiogenesis. Cell to cell communication was achieved using trans-well chambers, where SMCs were grown in the upper chamber and differentiated MAC in the bottom chamber for 24 or 72h. We found that cross-talk between MAC and SMC during co-culture: (i) significantly decreased the expression of ECM proteins (collagen I, III, elastin) in SMC; (ii) increased the expression and activity of metalloprotease MMP-9 and expression of collagenase MMP-1, in both MAC and SMC; (iii) augmented the secretion of soluble VEGF in the conditioned media of cell co-culture and VEGF gene expression in both cell types, compared with control cells. Moreover, the conditioned media collected from MAC–SMC co-culture promoted endothelial cell tube formation in Matrigel, signifying an increased angiogenic effect. In addition, the MAC–SMC communication led to an increase in inflammatory IL-1β and TLR-2, which could be responsible for cellular signaling. In conclusion, MAC–SMC communication affects factors and molecules that could alter ECM composition and neo-angiogenesis, features that could directly dictate the progression of atheroma towards the vulnerable plaque. Targeting the MAC–SMC cross-talk may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to slow-down or retard the plaque progression.

Abstract: The redox properties of cellular environments are critical to many functional processes, and are strictly controlled in all living organisms. The glutathione-glutathione disulfide (GSH-GSSG) couple is the most abundant intracellular redox couple. A GSH redox potential can be calculated for each cellular compartment, which reflects the redox properties of that environment. This redox potential is often used to predict the redox state of a disulfide-containing protein, based on thermodynamic considerations. However, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions are often catalyzed by specific partners, and the distribution of the redox states of a protein may not correspond to the thermodynamic equilibrium with the GSH pool. Ideally, the protein redox state should be measured directly, bypassing the need to extrapolate from the GSH. Here, by in-cell NMR, we directly observe the redox state of three human proteins, Cox17, Mia40 and SOD1, in the cytoplasm of human and bacterial cells. We compare the observed distributions of redox states with those predicted by the GSH redox potential, and our results partially agree with the predictions. Discrepancies likely arise from the fact that the redox state of SOD1 is controlled by a specific partner, its copper chaperone (CCS), in a pathway which is not linked to the GSH redox potential. In principle, in-cell NMR allows determining whether redox proteins are at the equilibrium with GSH, or they are kinetically regulated. Such approach does not need assumptions on the redox potential of the environment, and provides a way to characterize each redox-regulating pathway separately.

Abstract: Our knowledge of the proteome of plant peroxisomes and their functional plasticity is far from being complete, primarily due to major technical challenges in experimental proteome research of the fragile cell organelle. Several unexpected novel plant peroxisome functions, for instance in biotin and phylloquinone biosynthesis, have been uncovered recently. Nevertheless, very few regulatory and membrane proteins of plant peroxisomes have been identified and functionally described up to now. To define the matrix proteome of plant peroxisomes, computational methods have emerged as important powerful tools. Novel prediction approaches of high sensitivity and specificity have been developed for peroxisome targeting signals type 1 (PTS1) and have been validated by in vivo subcellular targeting analyses and thermodynamic binding studies with the cytosolic receptor, PEX5. Accordingly, the algorithms allow the correct prediction of many novel peroxisome-targeted proteins from plant genome sequences and the discovery of additional organelle functions. In this review, we provide an overview of methodologies, capabilities and accuracies of available prediction algorithms for PTS1 carrying proteins. We also summarize and discuss recent quantitative, structural and mechanistic information of the interaction of PEX5 with PTS1 carrying proteins in relation to in vivo import efficiency. With this knowledge, we develop a model of how proteins likely evolved peroxisomal targeting signals in the past and still nowadays, in which order the two import pathways might have evolved in the ancient eukaryotic cell, and how the secondary loss of the PTS2 pathway probably happened in specific organismal groups.

Identification of a redox-modulatory interaction between selenoprotein W and 14-3-3 protein,

Abstract: Selenoprotein W (SelW) contains a selenocysteine (Sec, U) in a conserved CXXU motif corresponding to the CXXC redox motif of thioredoxin, suggesting a putative redox function of SelW. We have previously reported that the binding of 14-3-3 protein to its target proteins, including CDC25B, Rictor and TAZ, is inhibited by the interaction of 14-3-3 protein with SelW. However, the binding mechanism is unclear. In this study, we sought to determine the binding site of SelW to understand the regulatory mechanism of the interaction between SelW and 14-3-3 and its biological effects. Phosphorylated Ser(pS) or Thr(pT) residues in RSXpSXP or RXXXp(S/T)XP motifs are well-known common 14-3-3-binding sites, but Thr41, Ser59, and T69 of SelW, which are computationally predicted to serve are phosphorylation sites, were neither phosphorylation sites nor sites involved in the interaction. A mutant SelW in which Sec13 is changed to Ser (U13S) was unable to interact with 14-3-3 protein and thus did not inhibit the interaction of 14-3-3 to other target proteins. However, other Cys mutants of SelW(C10S, C33S and C37S) normally interacted with 14-3-3 protein. The interaction of SelW to 14-3-3 protein was enhanced by diamide or H2O2 and decreased by dithiothreitol (DTT). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the Sec of SelW is involved in its interaction with 14-3-3 protein and that this interaction is increased under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, SelW may have a regulatory function in redox cell signaling by interacting with 14-3-3 protein.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging uses spectral and spatial image information for target detection and classification. In this work hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging was applied to patient olfactory neurosphere-derived cells, a cell model of a human metabolic disease MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like syndrome). By using an endogenous source of contrast subtle metabolic variations have been detected between living cells in their full morphological context which made it possible to distinguish healthy from diseased cells before and after therapy. Cellular maps of native fluorophores, flavins, bound and free NADH and retinoids unveiled subtle metabolic signatures and helped uncover significant cell subpopulations, in particular a subpopulation with compromised mitochondrial function. Taken together, our results demonstrate that multispectral spectral imaging provides a new non-invasive method to investigate neurodegenerative and other disease models, and it paves the way for novel cellular characterisation in health, disease and during treatment, with proper account of intrinsic cellular heterogeneity.

Abstract: Background
Oral mucositis (OM) is a relevant adverse effect of anticancer therapy involving ionizing radiation (IR) and doxorubicin (Doxo). Because DNA damage of keratinocytes is causative for the pathogenesis of OM, we aim to identify pharmacological measures for geno- and cytoprotection of keratinocytes.
Methods
We investigated the influence of the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin on cell death, proliferation and DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms of human keratinocytes following treatment with IR and Doxo.
Results
Lovastatin protected keratinocytes from the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of IR and Doxo as shown by a diminished induction of apoptosis as well as a reduced formation and slightly improved repair of DNA damage following Doxo and IR treatment, respectively. Lovastatin selectively blocked the activation of Chk1 and ATR kinases following treatment with IR, Doxo and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea, indicating that the statin antagonizes ATR/Chk1-regulated replicative stress responses. Part of the cytoprotective activity of lovastatin seems to rest on a delayed entry of lovastatin treated cells into S-phase. Yet, because the statin also protected non-proliferating keratinocytes from IR- and Doxo-induced cytotoxicity, cell cycle independent protective mechanisms are involved, too.
Conclusions
Lovastatin attenuates pro-toxic DNA damage-related responses of keratinocytes stimulated by OM-inducing anticancer therapeutics. The data encourage forthcoming in vivo and clinical studies addressing the usefulness of statins in the prevention of OM.

Abstract: Actin remodeling is a vital process for signaling, movement and survival in all cells. In the testes, extensive actin reorganization occurs at spermatid–Sertoli cell junctions during sperm release (spermiation) and at inter Sertoli cell junctions during restructuring of the blood testis barrier (BTB). During spermiation, tubulobulbar complexes (TBCs), rich in branched actin networks, ensure recycling of spermatid–Sertoli cell junctional molecules. Similar recycling occurs during BTB restructuring around the same time as spermiation occurs. Actin related protein 2/3 complex is an essential actin nucleation and branching protein. One of its subunits, Arpc1b, was earlier found to be down-regulated in an estrogen-induced rat model of spermiation failure. Also, Arpc1b was found to be estrogen responsive through estrogen receptor beta in seminiferous tubule culture. Here, knockdown of Arpc1b by siRNA in adult rat testis led to defects in spermiation caused by failure in TBC formation. Knockdown also compromised BTB integrity and caused polarity defects of mature spermatids. Apart from these effects pertaining to Sertoli cells, Arpc1b reduction perturbed ability of germ cells to enter G2/M phase thus hindering cell division. In summary, Arpc1b, an estrogen responsive gene, is a regulator of spermiation, mature spermatid polarity, BTB integrity and cell division during adult spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Peroxisomal protein import is essentially different to the translocation of proteins into other organelles. The molecular mechanisms by which completely folded or even oligomerized proteins cross the peroxisomal membrane remain to be disclosed. The identification of a water-filled pore that is mainly constituted by Pex5 and Pex14 led to the assumption that proteins are translocated through a large, probably transient, protein-conducting channel. Here, we will review the work that led to the identification of this translocation pore. In addition, we will discuss the main biophysical features of the pore and compare it with other protein–translocation channels. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: Organelle inheritance is the process by which eukaryotic cells actively replicate and equitably partition their organelles between mother cell and daughter cell at cytokinesis to maintain the benefits of subcellular compartmentalization. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven invaluable in helping to define the factors involved in the inheritance of different organelles and in understanding how these factors act and interact to maintain balance in the organelle populations of actively dividing cells. Inheritance factors can be classified as motors that transport organelles, tethers that retain organelles, and connectors (receptors) that mediate the attachment of organelles to motors and anchors. This article will review how peroxisomes are inherited by cells, with a focus on budding yeast, and will discuss common themes and mechanisms of action that underlie the inheritance of all membrane-enclosed organelles. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Peroxisomes edited by Ralf Erdmann.

Abstract: Covalent attachment of the Small ubiquitin-like modifier (Sumo) polypeptide to proteins regulates many processes in the eukaryotic cell. In the nervous system, Sumo has been associated with the synapsis and with neurodegenerative diseases. However, its involvement in regulating neuronal differentiation remains largely unknown. Here we show that net Sumo deconjugation is observed during neurogenesis and that Sumo overexpression impairs this process. In an attempt to shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we have analyzed the expression profile of genes coding for components of the sumoylation pathway following induction of neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, we observed strong upregulation of the Senp7 protease at both mRNA and protein levels under differentiation conditions. Sumo proteases, by removing Sumo from targets, are key regulators of sumoylation. Strikingly, loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that Senp7 is required for neuronal differentiation not only in a model cell line, but also in the developing neural tube. Finally, reporter-based analysis of the Senp7 promoter indicated that Senp7 was transiently activated at early stages of neuronal differentiation. Thus, the Sumo protease Senp7 adds to the list of factors involved in vertebrate neurogenesis.
