Abstract: Summary
Morphogenetic movements during animal development involve repeated making and breaking of cell-cell contacts. Recent biophysical models of cell-cell adhesion integrate adhesion molecule interactions and cortical cytoskeletal tension modulation, describing equilibrium states for established contacts. We extend this emerging unified concept of adhesion to contact formation kinetics, showing that aggregating Xenopus embryonic cells rapidly achieve Ca2+-independent low-contact states. Subsequent transitions to cadherin-dependent high-contact states show rapid decreases in contact cortical F-actin levels but slow contact area growth. We developed a biophysical model that predicted contact growth quantitatively from known cellular and cytoskeletal parameters, revealing that elastic resistance to deformation and cytoskeletal network turnover are essential determinants of adhesion kinetics. Characteristic time scales of contact growth to low and high states differ by an order of magnitude, being at a few minutes and tens of minutes, respectively, thus providing insight into the timescales of cell-rearrangement-dependent tissue movements.

Abstract: Summary
WNT morphogens trigger signaling pathways fundamental for embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer. WNTs are modified with palmitoleate, which is critical for binding Frizzled (FZD) receptors and activating signaling. However, it is unknown how WNTs are released and spread from cells, given their strong lipid-dependent membrane attachment. We demonstrate that secreted FZD-related proteins and WNT inhibitory factor 1 are WNT carriers, potently releasing lipidated WNTs and forming active soluble complexes. WNT release occurs by direct handoff from the membrane protein WNTLESS to the carriers. In turn, carriers donate WNTs to glypicans and FZDs involved in WNT reception and to the NOTUM hydrolase, which antagonizes WNTs by lipid moiety removal. WNT transfer from carriers to FZDs is greatly facilitated by glypicans that serve as essential co-receptors in Wnt signaling. Thus, an extracellular network of carriers dynamically controls secretion, posttranslational regulation, and delivery of WNT morphogens, with important practical implications for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) represents a sensitive molecular marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and is implicated in stem cell biology. We established a model of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation and examined the dynamics of γH2AX foci during the process. Our results revealed high numbers of γH2AX foci in undifferentiated mESCs, decreasing as the cells differentiated towards the endothelial cell lineage. Notably, we observed two distinct patterns of γH2AX foci: the typical discrete γH2AX foci, which colocalize with the transcriptionally permissive chromatin mark H3K4me3, and the less well-characterized clustered γH2AX regions, which were only observed in intermediate progenitor cells. Next, we explored responses of mESCs to γ-radiation (137Cs). Following exposure to γ-radiation, mESCs showed a reduction in cell viability and increased γH2AX foci, indicative of radiosensitivity. Despite irradiation, surviving mESCs retained their differentiation potential. To further exemplify our findings, we investigated neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs). Similar to mESCs, NSPCs displayed clustered γH2AX foci associated with progenitor cells and discrete γH2AX foci indicative of embryonic stem cells or differentiated cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that γH2AX serves as a versatile marker of DSBs and may have a role as a biomarker in stem cell differentiation. The distinct patterns of γH2AX foci in differentiating mESCs and NSPCs provide valuable insights into DNA repair dynamics during differentiation, shedding light on the intricate balance between genomic integrity and cellular plasticity in stem cells. Finally, the clustered γH2AX foci observed in intermediate progenitor cells is an intriguing feature, requiring further exploration.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignancy dominated by the infiltration of tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs). Examination of TAMC metabolic phenotypes in mouse models and patients with GBM identified the de novo creatine metabolic pathway as a hallmark of TAMCs. Multi-omics analyses revealed that TAMCs surround the hypoxic peri-necrotic regions of GBM and express the creatine metabolic enzyme glycine amidinotransferase (GATM). Conversely, GBM cells located within these same regions are uniquely specific in expressing the creatine transporter (SLC6A8). We hypothesized that TAMCs provide creatine to tumors, promoting GBM progression. Isotopic tracing demonstrated that TAMC-secreted creatine is taken up by tumor cells. Creatine supplementation protected tumors from hypoxia-induced stress, which was abrogated with genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of SLC6A8. Lastly, inhibition of creatine transport using the clinically relevant compound, RGX-202-01, blunted tumor growth and enhanced radiation therapy in vivo. This work highlights that myeloid-to-tumor transfer of creatine promotes tumor growth in the hypoxic niche.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome has been found to play a crucial role in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), which is still considered incurable due to drug resistance. In previous studies, we demonstrated that intestinal nitrogen-recycling bacteria are enriched in patients with MM. However, their role in MM relapse remains unclear. This study highlights the specific enrichment of Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) in patients with relapsed MM. Through fecal microbial transplantation experiments, we demonstrate that C. freundii plays a critical role in inducing drug resistance in MM by increasing levels of circulating ammonium. The ammonium enters MM cells through the transmembrane channel protein SLC12A2, promoting chromosomal instability and drug resistance by stabilizing the NEK2 protein. We show that furosemide sodium, a loop diuretic, downregulates SLC12A2, thereby inhibiting ammonium uptake by MM cells and improving progression-free survival and curative effect scores. These findings provide new therapeutic targets and strategies for the intervention of MM progression and drug resistance.

Abstract: Ca2+ signaling is essential for cardiac contractility and excitability in heart function and remodeling. Intriguingly, little is known about the role of a new family of ion channels, the endo-lysosomal non-selective cation “two-pore channel” (TPCs) in heart function. Here we have used double TPC knock-out mice for the 1 and 2 isoforms of TPCs (Tpcn1/2−/−) and evaluated their cardiac function. Doppler-echocardiography unveils altered left ventricular (LV) systolic function associated with a LV relaxation impairment. In cardiomyocytes isolated from Tpcn1/2−/- mice, we observed a reduction in the contractile function with a decrease in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content and a reduced expression of various key proteins regulating Ca2+ stores, such as calsequestrin. We also found that two main regulators of the energy metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase and mTOR, were down regulated. We found an increase in the expression of TPC1 and TPC2 in a model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mice and in chronically isoproterenol infused WT mice. In this last model, adaptive cardiac hypertrophy was reduced by Tpcn1/2 deletion. Here, we propose a central role for TPCs and lysosomes that could act as a hub integrating information from the excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms, cellular energy metabolism and hypertrophy signaling.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the most common diseases in the digestive system related to aberrant inflammation. V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing 4 (VSIG4), a type I transmembrane receptor exclusively expressed in a subset of tissue-resident macrophages, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activity in immune-related diseases, which has been not explored in IBD yet. This study aims to explore the role and the potential mechanism of VSIG4 in IBD. Clinical samples were obtained from IBD patients and were examined by immunohistochemical staining. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages, and then stimulated with IL-4 plus IL-13 or LPS to induce pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. Cell transfection was conducted to overexpress VSIG4. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were performed to assess NLRP3 inflammasome- and pyroptosis-related proteins. Cytokines were measured using ELISA. A cell co-culture model of Caco-2 cells and VSIG4-mediated macrophages were established. Cell viability and apoptosis was examined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. VSIG4 was downregulated in IBD and was negatively correlated with NLRP3 inflammasome. M1 macrophages exhibited higher levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptosis and inflammatory response than M2 macrophages, while VSIG4 overexpression efficiently reversed these changes in M1 macrophages. In addition, VSIG4 overexpression partly abolished M1 macrophages-induced cell viability loss, inflammatory response, apoptosis and pyroptosis in Caco-2 cells. Collectively, VSIG4 might alleviate intestinal inflammation through regulating M1/M2 macrophages, providing novel insights for the treatment of human IBD.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages populate the embryo early in gestation, but their role in development is not well defined. In particular, specification and function of macrophages in intestinal development remain little explored. To study this event in the human developmental context, we derived and combined human intestinal organoid and macrophages from pluripotent stem cells. Macrophages migrate into the organoid, proliferate, and occupy the emerging microanatomical niches of epithelial crypts and ganglia. They also acquire a transcriptomic profile similar to that of fetal intestinal macrophages and display tissue macrophage behaviors, such as recruitment to tissue injury. Using this model, we show that macrophages reduce glycolysis in mesenchymal cells and limit tissue growth without affecting tissue architecture, in contrast to the pro-growth effect of enteric neurons. In short, we engineered an intestinal tissue model populated with macrophages, and we suggest that resident macrophages contribute to the regulation of metabolism and growth of the developing intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic regulation of cardiomyocyte differentiation is central to heart development and function. This study uses genetic loss-of-function human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to evaluate the genomic regulatory basis of the non-DNA-binding homeodomain protein HOPX. We show that HOPX interacts with and controls cardiac genes and enhancer networks associated with diverse aspects of heart development. Using perturbation studies in vitro, we define how upstream cell growth and proliferation control HOPX transcription to regulate cardiac gene programs. We then use cell, organoid, and zebrafish regeneration models to demonstrate that HOPX-regulated gene programs control cardiomyocyte function in development and disease. Collectively, this study mechanistically links cell signaling pathways as upstream regulators of HOPX transcription to control gene programs underpinning cardiomyocyte identity and function.

Abstract: Summary
Environmental factors influence an organism’s reproductive ability by regulating germline development and physiology. While the reproductive adaptations in response to extrinsic stress cues offer fitness and survival advantages to individuals, the mechanistic understanding of these modifications remains unclear. Here, we find that parasitoid wasps’ stress signaling regulates Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis. We show that fruit flies dwelling in the wasp-infested area elevate their fecundity, and the observed reproductive response is specific to Pachycrepoideus sp., a pupal parasitoid wasp. Pachycrepoideus-specific olfactory and visual cues recruit the signaling pathways that promote germline stem cell proliferation and accelerate follicle development, increasing egg production in Drosophila females. Downregulation of signaling engaged in oocyte development by shifting flies to a non-wasp-infested environment increases apoptosis of the developing follicles. Thus, this study establishes host germline responsiveness to parasitoid-specific signals and supports a predator strategy to increase hosts for infection.

Abstract: Summary
The role of hematopoietic Hedgehog signaling in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) remains incompletely understood despite data suggesting that Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitors have therapeutic activity in patients. We aim to systematically interrogate the role of canonical vs. non-canonical Hh signaling in MPNs. We show that Gli1 protein levels in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) mark fibrotic progression and that, in murine MPN models, absence of hematopoietic Gli1, but not Gli2 or Smo, significantly reduces MPN phenotype and fibrosis, indicating that GLI1 in the MPN clone can be activated in a non-canonical fashion. Additionally, we establish that hematopoietic Gli1 has a significant effect on stromal cells, mediated through a druggable MIF-CD74 axis. These data highlight the complex interplay between alterations in the MPN clone and activation of stromal cells and indicate that Gli1 represents a promising therapeutic target in MPNs, particularly that Hh signaling is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the ERAP2 gene are associated with various autoimmune conditions, as well as protection against lethal infections. Due to high linkage disequilibrium, numerous trait-associated SNPs are correlated with ERAP2 expression; however, their functional mechanisms remain unidentified. We show by reciprocal allelic replacement that ERAP2 expression is directly controlled by the splice region variant rs2248374. However, disease-associated variants in the downstream LNPEP gene promoter are independently associated with ERAP2 expression. Allele-specific conformation capture assays revealed long-range chromatin contacts between the gene promoters of LNPEP and ERAP2 and showed that interactions were stronger in patients carrying the alleles that increase susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Replacing the SNPs in the LNPEP promoter by reference sequences lowered ERAP2 expression. These findings show that multiple SNPs act in concert to regulate ERAP2 expression and that disease-associated variants can convert a gene promoter region into a potent enhancer of a distal gene.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian neocortex formation follows a stereotypical pattern wherein the self-renew and differentiation of neural stem cells are coordinated with diverse organelle dynamics. However, the role of lysosomes in brain development has long been overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the highly dynamic lysosomal quantities, types, and localizations in developing brain. We observed asymmetric endolysosome inheritance during radial glial cell (RGC) division and the increased autolysosomes within intermediate progenitor cells (IPs) and newborn neurons. Disruption of lysosomal function shortens the S phase of the cell cycle and promotes RGC differentiation. Mechanistically, we revealed a post-transcriptional regulation governing ribosome homeostasis and cell-cycle progression through differential lysosomal activity modulation. In the human forebrain organoid, lysosomal dynamics are conserved; specifically, during the mitosis of outer subventricular zone RGCs (oRGs), lysosomes are inherited by the progeny without basal process. Together, our results identify the critical role of lysosomal dynamics in regulating mouse and human brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are recognized potential therapeutic targets, but poor understanding of these heterogeneous cell populations has limited the development of effective treatment strategies. We previously identified transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) as a main driver of myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs). Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor/Erb-B2 receptor (EGFR/ERBB2) signaling is induced by TGF-β in myCAFs through an autocrine process mediated by amphiregulin. Inhibition of this EGFR/ERBB2-signaling network in PDAC organoid-derived cultures and mouse models differentially impacts distinct CAF subtypes, providing insights into mechanisms underpinning their heterogeneity. Remarkably, EGFR-activated myCAFs promote PDAC metastasis in mice, unmasking functional significance in myCAF heterogeneity. Finally, analyses of other cancer datasets suggest that these processes might operate in other malignancies. These data provide functional relevance to myCAF heterogeneity and identify a candidate target for preventing tumor invasion in PDAC.

Abstract: Directed cell migration requires a local fine-tuning of Rho GTPase activity to control protrusion formation, cell-cell contraction, and turnover of cellular adhesions. The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TRIO is ideally suited to control RhoGTPase activity because it combines two distinct catalytic domains to control Rac1 and RhoA activity in one molecule. However, at the cellular level, this molecular feature also requires a tight spatiotemporal control of TRIO activity. Here, we analyze the dynamic localization of Trio in Xenopus cranial neural crest (NC) cells, where we have recently shown that Trio is required for protrusion formation and migration. Using live cell imaging, we find that the GEF2 domain, but not the GEF1 domain of Trio, dynamically colocalizes with EB3 at microtubule plus-ends. Microtubule-mediated transport of Trio appears to be relevant for its function in NC migration, as a mutant GEF2 construct lacking the SxIP motif responsible for microtubule plus-end localization was significantly impaired in its ability to rescue the Trio loss-of-function phenotype compared to wild-type GEF2. Furthermore, by analyzing microtubule dynamics in migrating NC cells, we observed that loss of Trio function stabilized microtubules at cell-cell contact sites compared to controls, whereas they were destabilized at the leading edge of NC cells. Our data suggest that Trio is transported by microtubules to distinct subcellular locations where it has different functions in controlling microtubule stability, cell morphology, and cell-cell interaction during directed NC migration.

Abstract: Many physiological functions, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, muscle contraction, neurotransmission and fertilisation, are regulated by changes of Ca2+ levels. The major Ca2+ store in cells is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Certain cellular processes induce ER store depletion, e.g. by activating IP3 receptors, that in turn induces a store refilling process known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). This refilling process entails protein-protein interactions between Ca2+ sensing stromal interaction molecules (STIM) in the ER membrane and Orai proteins in the plasma membrane. Fully assembled STIM/Orai complexes then form highly selective Ca2+ channels called Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ Channels (CRAC) through which Ca2+ ions flow into the cytosol and subsequently are pumped into the ER by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Abnormal SOCE has been associated with numerous human diseases and cancers, and therefore key players STIM and Orai have attracted significant therapeutic interest. Several potent experimental and clinical candidate compounds have been developed and have helped to study SOCE in various cell types. We have synthesized multiple novel small-molecule probes based on the known SOCE inhibitor GSK-7975A. Here we present GSK-7975A derivatives, which feature photo-caging, photo-crosslinking, biotin and clickable moieties, and also contain deuterium labels. Evaluation of these GSK-7975A probes using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR)-Tetra-based Ca2+ imaging assay showed that most synthetic modifications did not have a detrimental impact on the SOCE inhibitory activity. The photo-caged GSK-7975A was also used in patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments. In summary, we have developed a number of active, GSK-7975A-based molecular probes that have interesting properties and therefore are useful experimental tools to study SOCE in various cells and settings.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal activity-dependent transcription plays a key role in plasticity and pathology in the brain. An intriguing question is how neuronal activity controls gene expression via interactions of transcription factors with DNA and chromatin modifiers in the nucleus. By utilizing single-molecule imaging in human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons, we demonstrate that neuronal activity increases repetitive emergence of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at histone acetylation sites in the nucleus, where RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) accumulation and FOS expression occur rapidly. Neuronal activity also enhances co-localization of CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Increased binding of a constitutively active CREB to CBP efficiently induces CREB repetitive emergence. On the other hand, the formation of histone acetylation sites is dependent on CBP histone modification via acetyltransferase (HAT) activity but is not affected by neuronal activity. Taken together, our results suggest that neuronal activity promotes repetitive CREB-CRE and CREB-CBP interactions at predetermined histone acetylation sites, leading to rapid gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The posttranslational modifier ubiquitin regulates most cellular processes. Its ability to form polymeric chains of distinct linkages is key to its diverse functionality. Yet, we still lack the experimental tools to induce linkage-specific polyubiquitylation of a protein of interest in cells. Here, we introduce a set of engineered ubiquitin protein ligases and matching ubiquitin acceptor tags for the rapid, inducible linear (M1-), K48-, or K63-linked polyubiquitylation of proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. By applying the so-called “Ubiquiton” system to proteasomal targeting and the endocytic pathway, we validate this tool for soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear as well as chromatin-associated and integral membrane proteins and demonstrate how it can be used to control the localization and stability of its targets. We expect that the Ubiquiton system will serve as a versatile, broadly applicable research tool to explore the signaling functions of polyubiquitin chains in many biological contexts.

Abstract: This investigation aimed to establish the promising role of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) growing from bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in relieving hyperglycemia induced in rats. BM-MSCs were differentiated into IPCs using three different protocols. The efficiency of BM-MSCs differentiation into IPCs in vitro was confirmed by detecting IPCs specific gene expression (Foxa-2, PDX-1 and Ngn-3) and insulin release assay. The in vivo study design included 3 groups of male Wistar rats; negative control group, diabetic group and IPCs-transfused group (5 ×106 cells of the most functional IPCs/rat). One month after IPCs infusion, serum glucose, insulin, c-peptide and visfatin levels as well as pancreatic glucagon level were quantified. Gene expression analysis of pancreatic Foxa-2 and Sox-17, IGF-1 and FGF-10 was done. Additionally, histological investigation of pancreatic tissue sections was performed. Our data clarified that, the most functional IPCs are those generated from BM-MSCs using differentiation protocol 3 as indicated by the significant up-regulation of Foxa-2, PDX-1 and Ngn-3 gene expression levels. These findings were further emphasized by releasing of a significant amount of insulin in response to glucose load. The transplantation of the IPCs in diabetic rats elicited significant decline in serum glucose, visfatin and pancreatic glucagon levels along with significant rise in serum insulin and c-peptide levels. Moreover, it triggered significant up-regulation in the expression levels of pancreatic Foxa-2, Sox-17, IGF-1 and FGF-10 genes versus the untreated diabetic counterpart. The histopathological examination of pancreatic tissue almost assisted the biochemical and molecular genetic analyses. These results disclose that the cell therapy holds potential to develop a new cure for DM based on the capability of BM-MSCs to generate β-cell phenotype using specific protocol.

Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited heart disease, is frequently caused by mutations in the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7). Abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction are archetypical features of HCM caused by MYH7 gene mutations. However, the mechanism of how MYH7 mutations leads to these features remains unclear, which inhibits the development of effective therapies. Initially, cardiomyocytes were generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from an eight-year-old girl diagnosed with HCM carrying a MYH7(C.1063 G>A) heterozygous mutation(mutant-iPSC-CMs) and mutation-corrected isogenic iPSCs(control-iPSC-CMs) in the present study. Next, we compared phenotype of mutant-iPSC-CMs to that of control-iPSC-CMs, by assessing their morphology, hypertrophy-related genes expression, calcium handling, diastolic function and myofilament calcium sensitivity at days 15 and 40 respectively. Finally, to better understand increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity as a central mechanism of central pathogenicity in HCM, inhibition of calcium sensitivity with mavacamten can improveed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Mutant-iPSC-CMs exhibited enlarged areas, increased sarcomere disarray, enhanced expression of hypertrophy-related genes proteins, abnormal calcium handling, diastolic dysfunction and increased myofilament calcium sensitivity at day 40, but only significant increase in calcium sensitivity and mild diastolic dysfunction at day 15. Increased calcium sensitivity by levosimendan aggravates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy phenotypes such as expression of hypertrophy-related genes, abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction, while inhibition of calcium sensitivity significantly improves cardiomyocyte hypertrophy phenotypes in mutant-iPSC-CMs, suggesting increased myofilament calcium sensitivity is the primary mechanisms for MYH7 mutations pathogenesis. Our studies have uncovered a pathogenic mechanism of HCM caused by MYH7 gene mutations through which enhanced myofilament calcium sensitivity aggravates abnormal calcium handling and diastolic dysfunction. Correction of the myofilament calcium sensitivity was found to be an effective method for treating the development of HCM phenotype in vitro.

Abstract: Because adenomyosis (AM) ectopic primary cells are hard to come by, have a short lifespan, and the characteristics that alter over time, their utility in AM research is constrained. This study aimed to establish a line of immortalized human adenomyosis ectopic cell (ihAMEC) to change this situation. Primary cells were obtained from AM ectopic lesion tissue and then infected with Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 Tag (SV40 T) lentivirus and screened to establish immortalized cells. We verified the main features and found that the ihAMEC could be cultured for more than 50 generations and the proliferation ability of ihAMEC was more active than that of primary cells. The cytoskeleton and cell types of ihAMEC were similar to primary cells and maintained a normal karyotype. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, estrogen-metabolizing proteins, and estrogen/progesterone receptors in ihAMEC was similar to the expression seen in primary cells. In addition, the response of ihAMEC under estrogen treatment and Lipopolysaccharide intervention is similar to primary cells. The clonogenic ability of ihAMEC was lower than tumor cells and did not form tumors in tumorigenicity assays. Thus, ihAMEC can be used as in vitro cellular model for pathogenesis and drug development studies regarding AM.

Abstract: C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) has been reported to participate in cardiovascular diseases. However, the role and molecular mechanism of CTRP13 in obesity-induced endothelial cell damage is still unclear. In palmitic acid (PA)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), qRT-PCR and western blot were used to examine CTRP13 expression. CCK-8 and TUNEL assays were adopted to assess cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. ROS level and MDA content were evaluated by their commercial kits and inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA. Endothelial cell dysfunction was evaluated by detecting NO production and eNOS expression, and tube formation assay was performed to assess angiogenesis. AMPK pathway-related proteins were detected by western blot. The results showed that CTRP13 was downregulated in PA-induced HUVECs. CTRP13 overexpression reduced PA-induced cell viability loss and oxidative stress in HUVECs. Moreover, CTRP13 overexpression suppressed PA-induced inflammation and apoptosis, improved angiogenesis ability, and alleviated endothelial cell dysfunction in HUVECs. In addition, CTRP13 overexpression activated AMPK pathway and regulated the expressions of downstream NOX1/p38 and KLF2. Furthermore, compound C countervailed the impacts of CTRP13 overexpression on cell viability, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and endothelial function in PA-induced HUVECs. To sum up, CTRP13 overexpression may alleviate PA-induced endothelial cell damage.

Abstract: Summary
In plant roots, the identity of the stem cell niche (SCN) is maintained by an auxin gradient with its maximum in the quiescent center (QC). Optimal levels of auxin signaling are essential for root SCN identity, but the regulatory mechanisms that control this pathway in root are largely unknown. Here, we find that the zinc finger transcription factor sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity 1 (STOP1) regulates root SCN identity by negative feedback of auxin signaling in root tips. Mutation and overexpression of STOP1 both affect QC cell division and distal stem cell differentiation in the root. We find that auxin treatment stabilizes STOP1 via MPK3/6-dependent phosphorylation. Accumulating STOP1 can compete with AUX/IAAs to interact with, and enhance the repressive activity of, auxin-repressive response factor ARF2. Overall, we show that the MPK3/6-STOP1-ARF2 module prevents excessive auxin signaling in the presence of auxin to maintain root SCN identity.

Abstract: Summary
Fetal bone development occurs through the conversion of avascular cartilage to vascularized bone at the growth plate. This requires coordinated mobilization of osteoblast precursors with blood vessels. In adult bone, vessel-adjacent osteoblast precursors are maintained by mechanical stimuli; however, the mechanisms by which these cells mobilize and respond to mechanical cues during embryonic development are unknown. Here, we show that the mechanoresponsive transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) spatially couple osteoblast precursor mobilization to angiogenesis, regulate vascular morphogenesis to control cartilage remodeling, and mediate mechanoregulation of embryonic murine osteogenesis. Mechanistically, YAP and TAZ regulate a subset of osteoblast-lineage cells, identified by single-cell RNA sequencing as vessel-associated osteoblast precursors, which regulate transcriptional programs that direct blood vessel invasion through collagen-integrin interactions and Cxcl12. Functionally, in 3D human cell co-culture, CXCL12 treatment rescues angiogenesis impaired by stromal cell YAP/TAZ depletion. Together, these data establish functions of the vessel-associated osteoblast precursors in bone development.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and autism, involve altered synaptic transmission and plasticity. Functional characterization of their associated genes is vital for understanding physio-pathological brain functions. LGI3 is a recently recognized ID-associated gene encoding a secretory protein related to an epilepsy-gene product, LGI1. Here, we find that LGI3 is uniquely secreted from oligodendrocytes in the brain and enriched at juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons, forming nanoscale subclusters. Proteomic analysis using epitope-tagged Lgi3 knockin mice shows that LGI3 uses ADAM23 as a receptor and selectively co-assembles with Kv1 channels. A lack of Lgi3 in mice disrupts juxtaparanodal clustering of ADAM23 and Kv1 channels and suppresses Kv1-channel-mediated short-term synaptic plasticity. Collectively, this study identifies an extracellular organizer of juxtaparanodal Kv1 channel clustering for finely tuned synaptic transmission. Given the defective secretion of the LGI3 missense variant, we propose a molecular pathway, the juxtaparanodal LGI3-ADAM23-Kv1 channel, for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of TGF-β growth-inhibitory responses is a hallmark of human cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the TGF-β resistance of cancer cells remain to be fully elucidated. Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is a prion-like RNA-binding protein that is frequently upregulated in human cancers. In this study, we identified SFPQ as a potent suppressor of TGF-β signaling. The ability of SFPQ to suppress TGF-β responses depends on its prion-like domain (PrLD) that drives liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Mechanistically, SFPQ physically restrained Smad4 in its condensates, which excluded Smad4 from the Smad complex and chromatin occupancy and thus functionally dampened Smad-dependent transcriptional responses. Accordingly, SFPQ deficiency or loss of phase separation activities rendered human cells hypersensitive to TGF-β responses. Together, our data identify an important function of SFPQ through LLPS that suppresses Smad transcriptional activation and TGF-β tumor-suppressive activity.

Abstract: Summary
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) exert anti-inflammatory effects relevant to the chronic complications of type 2 diabetes. Although GLP-1RAs attenuate T cell-mediated gut and systemic inflammation directly through the gut intraepithelial lymphocyte GLP-1R, how GLP-1RAs inhibit systemic inflammation in the absence of widespread immune expression of the GLP-1R remains uncertain. Here, we show that GLP-1R activation attenuates the induction of plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) by multiple Toll-like receptor agonists. These actions are not mediated by hematopoietic or endothelial GLP-1Rs but require central neuronal GLP-1Rs. In a cecal slurry model of polymicrobial sepsis, GLP-1RAs similarly require neuronal GLP-1Rs to attenuate detrimental responses associated with sepsis, including sickness, hypothermia, systemic inflammation, and lung injury. Mechanistically, GLP-1R activation leads to reduced TNF-α via α1-adrenergic, δ-opioid, and κ-opioid receptor signaling. These data extend emerging concepts of brain-immune networks and posit a new gut-brain GLP-1R axis for suppression of peripheral inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Over 50 billion cells undergo apoptosis each day in an adult human to maintain immune homeostasis. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is also required to safeguard the function of immune response. However, it is unknown whether apoptosis regulates H2S production. Here, we show that apoptosis-deficient MRL/lpr (B6.MRL-Faslpr/J) and Bim−/− (B6.129S1-Bcl2l11tm1.1Ast/J) mice exhibit significantly reduced H2S levels along with aberrant differentiation of Th17 cells, which can be rescued by the additional H2S. Moreover, apoptotic cells and vesicles (apoVs) express key H2S-generating enzymes and generate a significant amount of H2S, indicating that apoptotic metabolism is an important source of H2S. Mechanistically, H2S sulfhydrates selenoprotein F (Sep15) to promote signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation and suppress STAT3 phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation. Taken together, this study reveals a previously unknown role of apoptosis in maintaining H2S homeostasis and the unique role of H2S in regulating Th17 cell differentiation via sulfhydration of Sep15C38.

Abstract: Background
Increasing evidence indicate that enhanced adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) could contribute to the adiposity alteration in marrow microenvironment of aplastic anemia (AA). Identifying small molecule drugs with role in inhibiting adipogenesis of BM-MSCs may represent a novel direction in AA therapy by improving BM-MSCs mediated marrow microenvironment.
Methods
For the purpose, we isolated AA BM-MSCs through whole bone marrow cell culture, evaluated a series of small molecule drugs using the in vitro adipogenic differentiation model of BM-MSCs, and finally focused on emodin, a natural anthraquinone derivative. Subsequently, we systematically investigated the molecular mechanism of emodin in attenuating adipogenic process by means of microarray profiling, bioinformatics analysis and lentivirus-mediated functional studies and rescue assay.
Results
We found that emodin presented significantly suppressive effect on the in vitro adipogenic differentiation of AA BM-MSCs. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that emodin could increase the expression of Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) which exhibited remarkably decreased expression in AA BM-MSCs compared with the normal counterparts and was subsequently demonstrated as a negative regulator in adipogenesis of AA BM-MSCs. Besides, TRIB3 depletion alleviated the suppressive effect of emodin on the adipogenic differentiation of AA BM-MSCs.
Conclusion
Our findings propose that emodin mediated TRIB3 up-regulation alleviates the adipogenic capacity of AA BM-MSCs, and emodin could serve as a potential therapeutic regimen for AA therapy.

Abstract: The identification and investigation of key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) hold paramount clinical significance. This study primarily focuses on elucidating the role of DEPDC1B within the context of MM. Our findings robustly affirm the abundant expression of DEPDC1B in MM tissues and cell lines. Notably, DEPDC1B depletion exerted inhibitory effects on MM cell proliferation and migration while concurrently facilitating apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest. These outcomes stand in stark contrast to the consequences of DEPDC1B overexpression. Furthermore, we identified CCNB1 as a putative downstream target, characterized by a co-expression pattern with DEPDC1B, mediating DEPDC1B's regulatory influence on MM. Additionally, our results suggest that DEPDC1B knockdown may activate the p53 pathway, thereby impeding MM progression. To corroborate these in vitro findings, we conducted in vivo experiments that further validate the regulatory role of DEPDC1B in MM and its interaction with CCNB1 and the p53 pathway. Collectively, our research underscores DEPDC1B as a potent promoter in the development of MM, representing a promising therapeutic target for MM treatment. This discovery bears significant implications for future investigations in this field.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer mortality results from incurable recurrences thought to be seeded by dormant, therapy-refractory residual tumor cells (RTCs). Understanding the mechanisms enabling RTC survival is therefore essential for improving patient outcomes. Here, we derive a dormancy-associated RTC signature that mirrors the transcriptional response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients and is enriched for extracellular matrix-related pathways. In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screening of dormancy-associated candidate genes identifies the galactosyltransferase B3GALT6 as a functional regulator of RTC fitness. B3GALT6 is required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) linkage to proteins to generate proteoglycans, and its germline loss of function in patients causes skeletal dysplasias. We find that B3GALT6-mediated biosynthesis of heparan sulfate GAGs predicts poor patient outcomes and promotes tumor recurrence by enhancing dormant RTC survival in multiple contexts, and does so via a B3GALT6-heparan sulfate/HS6ST1-heparan 6-O-sulfation/FGF1-FGFR2 signaling axis. These findings implicate B3GALT6 in cancer and nominate FGFR2 inhibition as a promising approach to eradicate dormant RTCs and prevent recurrence.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal definition of Ca2+ signals involves the assembly of signaling complexes within the nano-architecture of contact sites between the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) and the plasma membrane (PM). While the requirement of precise spatial assembly and positioning of the junctional signaling elements is well documented, the role of the nano-scale membrane architecture itself, as an ion-reflecting confinement of the signalling unit, remains as yet elusive. Utilizing the Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger-1 / SR/ER Ca2+ ATPase-2-mediated ER Ca2+ refilling process as a junctional signalling paradigm, we provide here the first evidence for an indispensable cellular function of the junctional membrane architecture. Our stochastic modeling approach demonstrates that junctional ER Ca2+ refilling operates exclusively at nano-scale membrane spacing, with a strong inverse relationship between junctional width and signaling efficiency. Our model predicts a breakdown of junctional Ca2+ signaling with loss of reflecting membrane confinement. In addition we consider interactions between Ca2+ and the phospholipid membrane surface, which may support interfacial Ca2+ transport and promote receptor targeting. Alterations in the molecular and nano-scale membrane organization at organelle-PM contacts are suggested as a new concept in pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Organoid technology is rapidly gaining ground for studies on organ (patho)physiology. Tubuloids are long-term expanding organoids grown from adult kidney tissue or urine. The progenitor state of expanding tubuloids comes at the expense of differentiation. Here, we differentiate tubuloids to model the distal nephron and collecting ducts, essential functional parts of the kidney. Differentiation suppresses progenitor traits and upregulates genes required for function. A single-cell atlas reveals that differentiation predominantly generates thick ascending limb and principal cells. Differentiated human tubuloids express luminal NKCC2 and ENaC capable of diuretic-inhibitable electrolyte uptake and enable disease modeling as demonstrated by a lithium-induced tubulopathy model. Lithium causes hallmark AQP2 loss, induces proliferation, and upregulates inflammatory mediators, as seen in vivo. Lithium also suppresses electrolyte transport in multiple segments. In conclusion, this tubuloid model enables modeling of the human distal nephron and collecting duct in health and disease and provides opportunities to develop improved therapies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Recent evidence establishes a pivotal role for obesity-induced inflammation in precipitating insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. Central to this process is the proinflammatory M1 adipose-tissue macrophages (ATMs) in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Notably, natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial regulator of ATMs since their cytokines induce ATM recruitment and M1 polarization. The importance of NK cells is shown by the strong increase in NK-cell numbers in eWAT, and by studies showing that removing and expanding NK cells respectively improve and worsen obesity-induced insulin resistance. It has been suggested that NK cells are activated by unknown ligands on obesity-stressed adipocytes that bind to NKp46 (encoded by Ncr1), which is an activating NK-cell receptor. This was supported by a study showing that NKp46-knockout mice have improved obesity-induced inflammation/insulin resistance. We therefore planned to use the NKp46-knockout mice to further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NKp46 mediates eWAT NK-cell activation in obesity. We confirmed that obesity increased eWAT NKp46+ NK-cell numbers and NKp46 expression in wild-type mice and that NKp46-knockout ablated these responses. Unexpectedly, however, NKp46-knockout mice demonstrated insulin resistance similar to wild-type mice, as shown by fasting blood glucose/insulin levels and glucose/insulin tolerance tests. Obesity-induced increases in eWAT ATM numbers and proinflammatory gene expression were also similar. Thus, contrary to previously published results, NKp46 does not regulate obesity-induced insulin resistance. It is therefore unclear whether NKp46 participates in the development of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. This should be considered when elucidating the obesity-mediated molecular mechanisms that activate NK cells.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a conserved cellular degradation process. While autophagy-related proteins were shown to influence the signaling and trafficking of some receptor tyrosine kinases, the relevance of this during cancer development is unclear. Here, we identify a role for autophagy in regulating platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) signaling and levels. We find that PDGFRA can be targeted for autophagic degradation through the activity of the autophagy cargo receptor p62. As a result, short-term autophagy inhibition leads to elevated levels of PDGFRA but an unexpected defect in PDGFA-mediated signaling due to perturbed receptor trafficking. Defective PDGFRA signaling led to its reduced levels during prolonged autophagy inhibition, suggesting a mechanism of adaptation. Importantly, PDGFA-driven gliomagenesis in mice was disrupted when autophagy was inhibited in a manner dependent on Pten status, thus highlighting a genotype-specific role for autophagy during tumorigenesis. In summary, our data provide a mechanism by which cells require autophagy to drive tumor formation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming in pediatric diffuse midline glioma is driven by gene expression changes induced by the hallmark histone mutation H3K27M, which results in aberrantly permissive activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Previous studies of diffuse midline glioma with altered H3K27 (DMG-H3K27a) have shown that the RAS pathway, specifically through its downstream kinase, extracellular-signal-related kinase 5 (ERK5), is critical for tumor growth. Further downstream effectors of ERK5 and their role in DMG-H3K27a metabolic reprogramming have not been explored. We establish that ERK5 is a critical regulator of cell proliferation and glycolysis in DMG-H3K27a. We demonstrate that ERK5 mediates glycolysis through activation of transcription factor MEF2A, which subsequently modulates expression of glycolytic enzyme PFKFB3. We show that in vitro and mouse models of DMG-H3K27a are sensitive to the loss of PFKFB3. Multi-targeted drug therapy against the ERK5-PFKFB3 axis, such as with small-molecule inhibitors, may represent a promising therapeutic approach in patients with pediatric diffuse midline glioma.

Abstract: Background
Gremlin 1 (GREM1) has been reported to be highly expressed in prostate hyperplasia tissues. However, the role and molecular mechanism of GREM1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is still unclear.
Methods
In this study, expression of GREM1 in BPH-1 cells was detected by western blot assay. Cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to assess cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and western blot were used to assess cell apoptosis and cell cycle. The EMT process was detected by western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, colivelin was used as a STAT3 activator and the expressions of STAT3/c-Myc signaling were assessed by western blot assay.
Results
The data showed that GREM1 silencing inhibited BPH-1 cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, GREM1 silencing repressed the cell cycle progression and the development of EMT. In addition, knockdown of GREM1 suppressed the expression of the STAT3/c-Myc signaling in BPH-1 cells and colivelin treatment rehabilitated this signaling. Moreover, c-Myc overexpression or colivelin reversed the effects of GREM1 silencing on BPH-1 cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, as well as EMT.
Conclusion
To sum up, GREM1 silencing may alleviate the BPH progress by inhibiting the STAT3/c-Myc signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression variation, an essential step between genotype and phenotype, is collectively controlled by local (cis) and distant (trans) regulatory changes. Nevertheless, how these regulatory elements differentially influence gene expression variation remains unclear. Here, we bridge this gap by analyzing the transcriptomes of a large diallel panel consisting of 323 unique hybrids originating from genetically divergent Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates. Our analysis across 5,087 transcript abundance traits showed that non-additive components account for 36% of the gene expression variance on average. By comparing allele-specific read counts in parent-hybrid trios, we found that trans-regulatory changes underlie the majority of gene expression variation in the population. Remarkably, most cis-regulatory variations are also exaggerated or attenuated by additional trans effects. Overall, we showed that the transcriptome is globally buffered at the genetic level mainly due to trans-regulatory variation in the population.

Abstract: The basement membrane (BM) demarcating epithelial tissues undergoes rapid expansion to accommodate tissue growth and morphogenesis during embryonic development. To facilitate the secretion of bulky BM proteins, their mRNAs are polarized basally in the follicle epithelial cells of the Drosophila egg chamber to position their sites of production close to their deposition. In contrast, we observed the apical rather than basal polarization of all major BM mRNAs in the outer epithelial cells adjacent to the BM of mouse embryonic salivary glands using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). Moreover, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence revealed apical polarization of both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, indicating that the site of BM component production was opposite to the site of deposition. At the apical side, BM mRNAs colocalized with ER, suggesting they may be co-translationally tethered. After microtubule inhibition, the BM mRNAs and ER became uniformly distributed rather than apically polarized, but they remained unchanged after inhibiting myosin II, ROCK, or F-actin, or after enzymatic disruption of the BM. Because Rab6 is generally required for Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking of BM components, we used lentivirus to express an mScarlet-tagged Rab6a in salivary gland epithelial cultures to visualize vesicle trafficking dynamics. We observed extensive bidirectional vesicle movements between Golgi at the apical side and the basal plasma membrane adjacent to the BM. Moreover, we showed that these vesicle movements depend on the microtubule motor kinesin-1 because very few vesicles remained motile after treatment with kinesore to compete for cargo-binding sites on kinesin-1. Overall, our work highlights the diverse strategies that different organisms use to secrete bulky matrix proteins: while Drosophila follicle epithelial cells strategically place their sites of BM protein production close to their deposition, mouse embryonic epithelial cells place their sites of production at the opposite end. Instead of spatial proximity, they use the microtubule cytoskeleton to mediate this organization as well as for the apical-to-basal transport of BM proteins.

Abstract: Summary
A major hypothesis for the etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) postulates initiation by viral infection, leading to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated interferon response and inflammation; however, a causal virus has not been identified. Here, we use a mouse model, corroborated with human islet data, to demonstrate that endogenous dsRNA in beta cells can lead to a diabetogenic immune response, thus identifying a virus-independent mechanism for T1D initiation. We found that disruption of the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) in beta cells triggers a massive interferon response, islet inflammation, and beta cell failure and destruction, with features bearing striking similarity to early-stage human T1D. Glycolysis via calcium enhances the interferon response, suggesting an actionable vicious cycle of inflammation and increased beta cell workload.

Abstract: Epithelial outpocketing, tunic softening, mesenchymal cell death, dedifferentiation/transdifferentiation, and resistance to environmental stress are major events that occur during asexual reproduction by budding in the tunicate, Polyandrocarpa misakiensis. To identify the molecules underlying these events and compare them with those operating in regeneration, differential gene expression profiles were developed in buds and zooids. Among approximately 40,000 contigs, 21 genes were identified as potentially being involved in asexual reproduction. Genes related to tunic softening, phagocytosis-stimulating opsonin, and stress resistance were activated in the very early stage of budding. At the later stage of budding when buds separated from the parent and entered the developmental stage, genes for cell adhesion, cell death, and differentiation were activated. The transcription factor AP2 was spatio-temporally expressed in a similar pattern to the tunic-softening gene endoglucanase (EndoG). AP2 mRNA activated EndoG when introduced into zooids by electroporation. Eight out of 21 budding-related genes were significantly activated by AP2 mRNA. Polyandrocarpa zooids possess regenerative potential other than budding. Zooidal regeneration accompanied cell death/phagocytosis, cell-cell adhesion/communication, and dedifferentiation/redifferentiation. Consistent with morphological features, eight related genes including SP8 transcription factor were activated during zooidal regeneration. Most of these genes were identical to those induced by AP2 mRNA, indicating that asexual reproduction in P. misakiensis shares AP2-regulated downstream genes with zooidal regeneration. The present results suggest that SP8 may be indispensable for both budding and regeneration and that the potential dedifferentiation-related gene SOXB1 plays a minor role in zooidal regeneration.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with a complex genetic basis, presenting both in familial and sporadic forms. The hexanucleotide (G4C2) repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, which triggers distinct pathogenic mechanisms, has been identified as a major contributor to familial and sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases. Animal models have proven pivotal in understanding these mechanisms; however, discrepancies between models due to variable transgene sequence, expression levels, and toxicity profiles complicate the translation of findings. Herein, we provide a systematic comparison of 7 publicly available Drosophila transgenes modeling the G4C2 expansion under uniform conditions, evaluating variations in their toxicity profiles. Further, we tested 3 previously characterized disease-modifying drugs in selected lines to uncover discrepancies among the tested strains. Our study not only deepens our understanding of the C9orf72 G4C2 mutations but also presents a framework for comparing constructs with minute structural differences. This work may be used to inform experimental designs to better model disease mechanisms and help guide the development of targeted interventions for neurodegenerative diseases, thus bridging the gap between model-based research and therapeutic application.

Abstract: Summary
Thirst and salt appetite are temporarily suppressed after water and salt ingestion, respectively, before absorption; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is the relay center of ingestion signals from the digestive organs. We herein identify two distinct neuronal populations expressing cholecystokinin (Cck) mRNA in the lateral PBN that are activated in response to water and salt intake, respectively. The two Cck neurons in the dorsal-lateral compartment of the PBN project to the median preoptic nucleus and ventral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, respectively. The optogenetic stimulation of respective Cck neurons suppresses thirst or salt appetite under water- or salt-depleted conditions. The combination of optogenetics and in vivo Ca2+ imaging during ingestion reveals that both Cck neurons control GABAergic neurons in their target nuclei. These findings provide the feedback mechanisms for the suppression of thirst and salt appetite after ingestion.

Abstract: Neointimal hyperplasia is reportedly essential for arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Oxidative stress is vital in the progression of uremic venous intimal hyperplasia. Studies have suggested that zinc ions obstruct vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown that the zinc finger protein, Zic family member 3 (ZIC3), is crucial for the earliest cardiovascular progenitors. ZIC3 mutations are associated with congenital heart disease. However, the mechanism of action of ZIC3 in vascular intimal hyperplasia in CKD remains unelucidated. Venous specimens were collected during primary AVF surgery and traumatic amputation, and serum samples were collected from patients with CKD and healthy controls. Mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to clarify the role of ZIC3 in CKD. ZIC3 expression was reduced in the veins of patients with uremia and the serum of those with CKD. Zic3 and Bcl2 levels were significantly decreased in mouse VSMCs treated with H2O2·H2O2 inhibited mouse VSMC activity, upregulated Bax, and cleaved caspase 3 expression. Following Zic3 overexpression, Bcl2 expression level and cell viability were elevated, whereas Bax and cleaved caspase 3 expression levels were downregulated. In contrast, Zic3 knockdown yielded the opposite results. Therefore, ZIC3 could be a new therapeutic target in venous neointimal hyperplasia of CKD.

Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that phosphatases play a pivotal role in modulating inflammation-associated signal transduction, particularly in the context of heat shock, where Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) appears to have a central role. Recently, Human Antigen R (HuR) has also been identified as a factor that enhances stress-response protein MKP-1 levels. Consequently, we have directed our interest towards elucidating the mechanisms by which heat shock induces MKP-1 mRNA stabilization, dependent on HuR via the p38 MAPK Signaling Cascade. In this study, we subjected Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (Mef) cells to heat shock treatment, resulting in a potent stabilization MKP-1 mRNA. The RNA-binding protein HuR, known to influence mRNA, was observed to bind to the MKP-1 AU-rich 3 ´untranslated region. Transfection of p38 wild-type Mef cells with a flag-HuR plasmid resulted in a significant increase in MKP-1 mRNA stability. Interestingly, transfection of the siRNA for HuR into Mef cells resulted in diminished MKP-1 mRNA stability following heat shock, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity effectively curtailed heat shock-mediated MKP-1 mRNA stability. Immunofluorescence analyses further revealed that the translocation of HuR was contingent on p38 MAPK Signaling Cascade. Collectively, these findings underscore the regulatory role of heat shock in MKP-1 gene expression at posttranscriptional levels. The mechanisms underlying the observed increased MKP-1 mRNA stability are shown to be partially dependent on HuR through the p38 MAPK Signaling Cascade.

Abstract: Summary
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with important roles in many cellular processes as well as in cancer and other diseases. EGF binding promotes EGFR dimerization and autophosphorylation through interactions that are well understood structurally. How these dimers relate to higher-order EGFR oligomers seen in cell membranes, however, remains unclear. Here, we used single-particle tracking (SPT) and Förster resonance energy transfer imaging to examine how each domain of EGFR contributes to receptor oligomerization and the rate of receptor diffusion in the cell membrane. Although the extracellular region of EGFR is sufficient to drive receptor dimerization, we find that the EGF-induced EGFR slowdown seen by SPT requires higher-order oligomerization—mediated in part by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain when it adopts an active conformation. Our data thus provide important insight into the interactions required for higher-order EGFR assemblies involved in EGF signaling.

Abstract: The forces driving tissue morphogenesis are thought to originate from cellular activities. While it is appreciated that extracellular matrix (ECM) may also be involved, ECM function is assumed to be simply instructive in modulating the cellular behaviors that drive changes to tissue shape. However, there is increasing evidence that the ECM may not be the passive player portrayed in developmental biology textbooks. In this review we highlight examples of embryonic ECM dynamics that suggest cell-independent activity, along with developmental processes during which localized ECM alterations and ECM-autonomous forces are directing changes to tissue shape. Additionally, we discuss experimental approaches to unveil active ECM roles during tissue morphogenesis. We propose that it may be time to rethink our general definition of morphogenesis as a cellular-driven phenomenon and incorporate an underappreciated, and surprisingly dynamic ECM.

Abstract: Summary
During morphogenesis, mechanical forces induce large-scale deformations; yet, how forces emerge from cellular contractility and adhesion is unclear. In Drosophila embryos, a tissue-scale wave of actomyosin contractility coupled with adhesion to the surrounding vitelline membrane drives polarized tissue invagination. We show that this process emerges subcellularly from the mechanical coupling between myosin II activation and sequential adhesion/de-adhesion to the vitelline membrane. At the wavefront, integrin clusters anchor the actin cortex to the vitelline membrane and promote activation of myosin II, which in turn enhances adhesion in a positive feedback. Following cell detachment, cortex contraction and advective flow amplify myosin II. Prolonged contact with the vitelline membrane prolongs the integrin-myosin II feedback, increases integrin adhesion, and thus slows down cell detachment and wave propagation. The angle of cell detachment depends on adhesion strength and sets the tensile forces required for detachment. Thus, we document how the interplay between subcellular mechanochemical feedback and geometry drives tissue morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are highly heterogeneous as resident immune cells in the central nervous system. Although the proinflammatory phenotype of microglia is driven by the metabolic transformation in the disease state, the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in microglia and whether it affects surrounding astrocyte progenitors have not been well elucidated. Here, we illustrate the communication between microglial metabolism and astrogenesis during embryonic development. The transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) reduces lactate production by inhibiting two key enzymes, HK2 and GAPDH, during glycolysis. Metabolic perturbation of microglia reduces lactate-dependent histone modification enrichment at the Lrrc15 promoter. The microglia-derived LRRC15 interacts with CD248 to participate in the JAK/STAT pathway and influence astrogenesis. In addition, Bach1cKO-Cx3 mice exhibit abnormal neuronal differentiation and anxiety-like behaviors. Altogether, this work suggests that the maintenance of microglia metabolic homeostasis during early brain development is closely related to astrogenesis, providing insights into astrogenesis and related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 RNA interacts with host factors to suppress interferon responses and simultaneously induces cytokine release to drive the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host RNAs to elicit such imbalanced immune responses remains elusive. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in situ structures and interactions in infected cells and patient lung samples using RIC-seq. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 RNA forms 2,095 potential duplexes with the 3′ UTRs of 205 host mRNAs to increase their stability by recruiting RNA-binding protein YBX3 in A549 cells. Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-to-host RNA duplex or knocking down YBX3 decreased host mRNA stability and reduced viral replication. Among SARS-CoV-2-stabilized host targets, NFKBIZ was crucial for promoting cytokine production and reducing interferon responses, probably contributing to cytokine storm induction. Our study uncovers the crucial roles of RNA-RNA interactions in the immunopathogenesis of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and provides valuable host targets for drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic kidney disease is a leading cause of death and disability globally and impacts individuals of African ancestry (AFR) or with ancestry in the Americas (AMS) who are under-represented in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of kidney function. To address this bias, we conducted a large meta-analysis of GWASs of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 145,732 AFR and AMS individuals. We identified 41 loci at genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8), of which two have not been previously reported in any ancestry group. We integrated fine-mapped loci with epigenomic and transcriptomic resources to highlight potential effector genes relevant to kidney physiology and disease, and reveal key regulatory elements and pathways involved in renal function and development. We demonstrate the varying but increased predictive power offered by a multi-ancestry polygenic score for eGFR and highlight the importance of population diversity in GWASs and multi-omics resources to enhance opportunities for clinical translation for all.

Abstract: The biomechanics of embryonic notochords are studied using an elastic membrane model. An initial study varying internal pressure and stiffness ratio determines tension and geometric ratios as a function of internal pressure, membrane stiffness ratio, and cell packing pattern. A subsequent three-point bending study determines flexural rigidity as a function of internal pressure, configuration, and orientation. Flexural rigidity is found to be independent of membrane stiffness ratio. Controlling for number and volume of cells and their internal pressure, the eccentric staircase pattern of cell packing has more than double the flexural rigidity of the radially symmetric bamboo pattern. Moreover, the eccentric staircase pattern is found to be more than twice as stiff in lateral bending than in dorsoventral bending. This suggests a mechanical advantage to the eccentric WT staircase pattern of the embryonic notochord, over patterns with round cross-section.

Abstract: Acetamiprid (ACMP) is a second-generation neonicotinoid that has been extensively used in the last few years. The present study examined the toxic effects of ACMP on the pancreas and glucose homeostasis through the evaluation of histological and biochemical changes and the possible ameliorative role of fenugreek seed extract (FG). Fifty adult albino rats were divided into 5 groups: negative control, positive control, FG-treated, ACMP-treated, and ACMP + FG-treated groups by oral gavage for 12 weeks. The ACMP-treated group highlighted significant elevations in plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c), serum amylase, and serum lipase, along with a decrease in plasma insulin levels. In addition, significant increases in tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were associated with reductions in the levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Moreover, glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase were significantly increased, with a significant reduction in hexokinase and liver glycogen stores. These biochemical changes were associated with histological changes in pancreatic sections stained by haematoxylin and eosin, Masson stain, and Orcein stain. ACMP-treated cells showed a marked reduction in β- cell immune reactivity to insulin, with pronounced p53, and beclin 1 immune expression. The use of FG with ACMP induced partial protection except for hexokinase and glycogen phosphorylase.

Abstract: Ivermectin is a popular antiparasitic drug used in veterinary and human medicine. Studies by our group have shown that therapeutic doses of ivermectin induce some brain and behavioral impairments, especially in the reproductive sphere. So far, the studies were focused in adulthood. Considering that juveniles are more susceptible to drugs during developmental stages and both farm/domestic animals and humans have been medicated with ivermectin in youth, it is necessary to evaluate the possible harm effects in youth. The stress variable is also important, as it potentially influences the effects produced by ivermectin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate morphofunctional and hormonal reproductive aspects of juvenile rats exposed to ivermectin and/or stressed. Prepubertal male rats were treated with 0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg of ivermectin (a therapeutic dose and a higher dose, respectively). Rats were also submitted to a restraint stress session. The testis morphology and histology were analyzed and plasma testosterone levels were measured. The two doses of ivermectin did not induce a biologically relevant effect on testis and testosterone levels of rats. However, restraint stress impaired macroscopic and microscopic morphometric and stereological parameters, as well as the histology of the testis: it increased the relative testis weight, the tubular diameter, the tubular luminal diameter, and the tubular cellular index, and injured the interstitial area. Previous treatment of juvenile rats with ivermectin prevented most of the stress-induced testes injuries. In conclusion, in addition to be a remarkable antiparasitic agent, ivermectin prevented stress-induced testes injuries in juvenile rats.

Abstract: Calcium is a universal intracellular messenger and proper Ca2+concentrations ([Ca2+]) both in the cytosol and in the lumen of cytoplasmic organelles are essential for cell functions. Ca2+ homeostasis is achieved by a delicate pump/leak balance both at the plasma membrane and at the endomembranes, and improper Ca2+ levels result in malfunction and disease. Selective intraorganellar Ca2+measurements are best achieved by using targeted genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) but to calibrate the luminal fluorescent signals into accurate [Ca2+] is challenging, especially in vivo, due to the difficulty to normalize and calibrate the fluorescent signal in various tissues or conditions. We report here a procedure to calibrate the ratiometric signal of GAP (GFP-Aequorin Protein) targeted to the endo-sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) into [Ca2+]ER/SR based on imaging of fluorescence after heating the tissue at 50–52 °C, since this value coincides with that obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (Rmin). Knowledge of the dynamic range (Rmax/Rmin) and the Ca2+-affinity (KD) of the indicator permits calculation of [Ca2+] by applying a simple algorithm. We have validated this procedure in vitro using several cell types (HeLa, HEK 293T and mouse astrocytes), as well as in vivo in Drosophila. Moreover, this methodology is applicable to other low Ca2+ affinity green and red GECIs.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Insulin is essential for maintaining normoglycemia and is predominantly secreted in response to glucose stimulation by β-cells. Incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, also stimulate insulin secretion. However, as obesity and type 2 diabetes worsen, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide loses its insulinotropic efficacy, whereas GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists continue to be effective owing to its signaling switch from Gs to Gq. Herein, we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced a transition from Gs to Gq in GLP-1R signaling in mouse islets. Intriguingly, chemical chaperones known to alleviate ER stress, such as 4-PBA and TUDCA, enforced GLP-1R’s Gq utilization rather than reversing GLP-1R’s signaling switch induced by ER stress or obese and diabetic conditions. In addition, the activation of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), 2 key ER stress-associated signaling (unfolded protein response) factors, promoted Gs utilization in GLP-1R signaling, whereas Gq employment by ER stress was unaffected by XBP1 or ATF6 activation. Our study revealed that ER stress and its associated signaling events alter GLP-1R’s signaling, which can be used in type 2 diabetes treatment.

Abstract: Mutations in the small, calcium-sensing, protein calmodulin cause cardiac arrhythmia and can ultimately prove lethal. Here, we report the impact of the G113R variant on the structure and dynamics of the calmodulin molecule, both in the presence and in the absence of calcium. We show that the mutation introduces minor changes into the structure of calmodulin and that it changes the thermostability and thus the degree of foldedness at human body temperature. The mutation also severely impacts the intramolecular mobility of calmodulin, especially in the apo form. Glycine 113 acts as an alpha-helical C-capping residue in both apo/ - and Ca2+/calmodulin, but its exchange to arginine has very different effects on the apo and Ca2+ forms. The majority of arrhythmogenic calmodulin variants identified affects residues in the Ca2+ coordinating loops of the two C-domain EF-Hands, causing a ‘direct impact on Ca2+ binding’. However, G113R lies outside a Ca2+ coordinating loop and acts differently and more similar to the previously characterized arrhythmogenic N53I. Therefore, we suggest that altered apo/CaM dynamics may be a novel general disease mechanism, defining low-calcium target affinity – or Ca2+ binding kinetics – critical for timely coordination of essential ion-channels in the excitation-contraction cycle.

Abstract: We have shown before that HDAC3 was involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer; however, the specific mechanism of HDAC3 on the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer has not been thoroughly studied. To explore the related proteins in the mechanism of HDAC3 on ovarian cancer. The transcriptome profiles were identified in ovarian carcinoma cells with HDAC3 knockdown or overexpression. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were used to verify transfection efficiency. Immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect the expression levels of HDAC3 and RNF144B in tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were confirmed by cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL) and transwell assay, respectively. The protein expression of p53, p21, Bax and Bcl-2 was confirmed by western blot, and CoIP assay was used to validate RNF144B/P21/P53 interaction. Meanwhile, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was performed to treat cells to probe p21 stability. Finally, we established an in vivo tumor model to explore the effects of HDAC3 and RNF144B on tumor growth. Microarray results showed that among the overlapping genes in the two profiles (HDAC3 knockdown and overexpression), RNF144B was decreased or increased in ovarian carcinoma cells with HDAC3 knockdown or overexpression, HDAC3 overexpression promoted RNF144B expression, and HDAC3 knockdown hindered RNF144B levels. The levels of HDAC3 and RNF144B in malignant ovarian cancer were significantly higher than those in normal ovarian tissue and benign ovarian cancer tissue. RNF144B promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of HDAC3 or RNF144B inhibited p53/p21/Bax expression and promoted Bcl-2 expression. Knockout of HDAC3 or RNF144B has the opposite effect, and RNF144B interacted with p21 and regulated the p21/p53 complex degradation, and finally in vivo experiments proved that HDAC3 and RNF144B promoted tumor growth. RNF144B-mediated p21 degradation regulated by HDAC3 contributed to enhancing ovarian cancer growth and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a master regulator that monitors the availability of various amino acids to promote cell growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is activated via two distinct upstream pathways: the Gtr pathway, which corresponds to mammalian Rag, and the Pib2 pathway. This study shows that Ser3 was phosphorylated exclusively in a Pib2-dependent manner. Using Ser3 as an indicator of TORC1 activity, together with the established TORC1 substrate Sch9, we investigated which pathways were employed by individual amino acids. Different amino acids exhibited different dependencies on the Gtr and Pib2 pathways. Cysteine was most dependent on the Pib2 pathway and increased the interaction between TORC1 and Pib2 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, cysteine directly bound to Pib2 via W632 and F635, two critical residues in the T(ail) motif that are necessary to activate TORC1. These results indicate that Pib2 functions as a sensor for cysteine in TORC1 regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Malignancy is enabled by pro-growth mutations and adequate energy provision. However, global metabolic activation would be self-terminating if it depleted tumor resources. Cancer cells could avoid this by rationing resources, e.g., dynamically switching between “baseline” and “activated” metabolic states. Using single-cell metabolic phenotyping of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, we identify MIA-PaCa-2 as having broad heterogeneity of fermentative metabolism. Sorting by a readout of lactic acid permeability separates cells by fermentative and respiratory rates. Contrasting phenotypes persist for 4 days and are unrelated to cell cycling or glycolytic/respiratory gene expression; however, transcriptomics links metabolically active cells with interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R)-STAT3 signaling. We verify this by IL-6R/STAT3 knockdowns and sorting by IL-6R status. IL-6R/STAT3 activates fermentation and transcription of its inhibitor, SOCS3, resulting in delayed negative feedback that underpins transitions between metabolic states. Among cells manifesting wide metabolic heterogeneity, dynamic IL-6R/STAT3 signaling may allow cell cohorts to take turns in progressing energy-intense processes without depleting shared resources.

Abstract: Summary
Microbes influence cancer initiation, progression and therapy responsiveness. IL-17 signaling contributes to gut barrier immunity by regulating microbes but also drives tumor growth. A knowledge gap remains regarding the influence of enteric IL-17-IL-17RA signaling and their microbial regulation on the behavior of distant tumors. We demonstrate that gut dysbiosis induced by systemic or gut epithelial deletion of IL-17RA induces growth of pancreatic and brain tumors due to excessive development of Th17, primary source of IL-17 in human and mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, as well as B cells that circulate to distant tumors. Microbial dependent IL-17 signaling increases DUOX2 signaling in tumor cells. Inefficacy of pharmacological inhibition of IL-17RA is overcome with targeted microbial ablation that blocks the compensatory loop. These findings demonstrate the complexities of IL-17-IL-17RA signaling in different compartments and the relevance for accounting for its homeostatic host defense function during cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is a risk factor for disease via increased susceptibility to infection, decreased ability to maintain homeostasis, inefficiency in combating stress, and decreased regenerative capacity. Multiple diseases, including urinary tract infection (UTI), are more prevalent with age; however, the mechanisms underlying the impact of aging on the urinary tract mucosa and the correlation between aging and disease remain poorly understood. Here, we show that, relative to young (8–12 weeks) mice, the urothelium of aged (18–24 months) female mice accumulates large lysosomes with reduced acid phosphatase activity and decreased overall autophagic flux in the aged urothelium, indicative of compromised cellular homeostasis. Aged bladders also exhibit basal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a dampened redox response, implying heightened oxidative stress. Furthermore, we identify a canonical senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in the aged urothelium, along with continuous NLRP3-inflammasome- and Gasdermin-D-dependent pyroptotic cell death. Consequently, aged mice chronically exfoliate urothelial cells, further exacerbating age-related urothelial dysfunction. Upon infection with uropathogenic E. coli, aged mice harbor increased bacterial reservoirs and are more prone to spontaneous recurrent UTI. Finally, we discover that treatment with D-mannose, a natural bioactive monosaccharide, rescues autophagy flux, reverses the SASP, and mitigates ROS and NLRP3/Gasdermin/interleukin (IL)-1β-driven pyroptotic epithelial cell shedding in aged mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that normal aging affects bladder physiology, with aging alone increasing baseline cellular stress and susceptibility to infection, and suggest that mannose supplementation could serve as a senotherapeutic to counter age-associated urothelial dysfunction.

Abstract: Objective
To construct a new diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model with short induction time, high incidence, and survival rate.
Methods
60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the model A (MA) group, the model B (MB) group, and the model C (MC) group. The control group was intraperitoneally injected with 0.9% saline for 6 weeks. The MA group was injected with the DEN solution at 30 mg/kg three times a week for 6 weeks. The MB group was injected with the DEN solution at 30 mg/kg three times a week for 6 weeks, and discontinued the induction for 2 weeks. The MC group was injected with the DEN solution at 30 mg/kg three times a week for 8 weeks. The levels of albumin (ALB), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum were assayed. Meanwhile, the pathological conditions, apoptosis of hepatocytes, expression of NF-κBp65, and the reactive oxygen species level were detected.
Results
All rats in the control group and the MA group survived, and none of the rats occurred HCC. HCC occurred in rats of the MB group and the MC group. The serum ALB level in the MB group was higher than that in the MC group. The serum ALT and AST levels and the number of proliferating and apoptotic hepatocyte cells in the MB group were lower than those in the MC group. The expression of ROS- and NF-κBp6- positive cells in the MA group, MB group, and MC group were significantly higher than that of the control group.
Conclusion
This study developed a new DEN-induced rat HCC model with short induction time, high incidence, and survival rate. NF-κB pathway may be one of the main pathways involved in the development of this model.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetics underpins the regulation of genes known to play a key role in the adaptive and innate immune system (AIIS). We developed a method, EpiNN, that leverages epigenetic data to detect AIIS-relevant genomic regions and used it to detect 2,765 putative AIIS loci. Experimental validation of one of these loci, DNMT1, provided evidence for a novel AIIS-specific transcription start site. We built a genome-wide AIIS annotation and used linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to test whether it predicts regional heritability using association statistics for 176 traits. We detected significant heritability effects (average |τ∗|=1.65) for 20 out of 26 immune-relevant traits. In a meta-analysis, immune-relevant traits and diseases were 4.45× more enriched for heritability than other traits. The EpiNN annotation was also depleted of trans-ancestry genetic correlation, indicating ancestry-specific effects. These results underscore the effectiveness of leveraging supervised learning algorithms and epigenetic data to detect loci implicated in specific classes of traits and diseases.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication produces a global disorganization of chromatin structure that takes hours to be restored. However, how these chromatin rearrangements affect the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cell identity is not clear. Here, we use ChOR-seq and ChrRNA-seq experiments to analyze RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity and nascent RNA synthesis during the first hours after chromatin replication in human cells. We observe that transcription elongation is rapidly reactivated in nascent chromatin but that RNAPII abundance and distribution are altered, producing heterogeneous changes in RNA synthesis. Moreover, this first wave of transcription results in RNAPII blockages behind the replication fork, leading to changes in alternative splicing. Altogether, our results deepen our understanding of how transcriptional programs are regulated during cell division and uncover molecular mechanisms that explain why chromatin replication is an important source of gene expression variability.

Abstract: The prevalence of tendinopathy in patients with diabetes is well documented. Despite efforts to improve diabetes management, there is a lack of research on therapeutic agents targeting the core features of tendinopathy, namely, tenocyte apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) damage. In this study, we investigated the potential of ginsenoside compound K (CK), known for its antidiabetic properties, to mitigate tenocyte apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the metalloproteinase (MMP) system under hyperglycemic conditions. Our research also aimed to unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of CK. The assessment of apoptosis involved observing intracellular chromatin condensation and measuring caspase 3 activity. To gauge oxidative stress, we examined cellular ROS levels and hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde concentrations. Western blotting was employed to determine the expression of various proteins. Our findings indicate that CK treatment effectively countered high glucose-induced apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in cultured tenocytes. Furthermore, CK normalized the expression of MMP-9, MMP-13, and TIMP-1. Notably, CK treatment boosted the expression of PPARγ and antioxidant enzymes. We conducted small interfering (si) RNA experiments targeting PPARγ, revealing its role in mediating CK's effects on tendinopathy features in hyperglycemic tenocytes. In conclusion, these in vitro results offer valuable insights into the potential therapeutic role of CK in managing tendinopathy among individuals with diabetes. By addressing crucial aspects of tendinopathy, CK presents itself as a promising avenue for future research and treatment development in this domain.

Abstract: The present molecular investigations of Organizer phenomena show a remarkable connection to the earlier classical embryological studies that used transplantation as a method for making mechanistic models of induction. One of the most prominent of these connections is the dual gradient model for anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral polarity. This paper will discuss some of the history of how transplantation experiments provided data that could be interpreted in terms of two gradients of biologically active materials. It will highlight how the attempts to discover the elusive Induktionsstoffen gave rise to the double gradient model of Sulo Toivonen and Lauri Saxén in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper will also document how this research into the identity of these molecules gave rise to the developmental genetics that eventually would find the molecules responsible for primary embryonic induction.

Abstract: The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activation and cytokine level were significantly increased in coronavirus disease-19. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an amplifier for cellular inflammation. This study aimed to elucidate the modulatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV-2 NP) on trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-induced lipogenesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the underlying mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 NP activates the dissociation of the SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) from the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in SREBP activation, increased lipogenic gene expression, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. TMAO was applied to VSMC-induced NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting the SCAP–SREBP complex endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi translocation, which facilitates directly binding of SARS-CoV-2 NP to the NLRP3 protein for NLRP3 inﬂammasome assembly. SARS-CoV-2 NP amplified the TMAO-induced lipogenic gene expression and NLRP3 inflammasome. Knockdown of SCAP–SREBP2 can effectively reduce lipogenic gene expression and alleviate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated systemic inflammation in VSMCs stimulated with TMAO and SARS-CoV-2 NP. These results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 NP amplified TMAO-induced lipogenesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation via priming the SCAP–SREBP signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Severe burns induce a chronic hypermetabolic state that persists well past wound closure, indicating that additional internal mechanisms must be involved. Adipose tissue is suggested to be a central regulator in perpetuating hypermetabolism, although this has not been directly tested. Here, we show that thermogenic adipose tissues are activated in parallel to increases in hypermetabolism independent of cold stress. Using an adipose tissue transplantation model, we discover that burn-derived subcutaneous white adipose tissue alone is sufficient to invoke a hypermetabolic response in a healthy recipient mouse. Concomitantly, transplantation of healthy adipose tissue alleviates metabolic dysfunction in a burn recipient. We further show that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway may mediate an immune-adipose crosstalk to regulate adipose tissue remodeling post-injury. Targeting this pathway could lead to innovative therapeutic interventions to counteract hypermetabolic pathologies.

Abstract: Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella or C. idella) is a Cyprinid fish frequently utilized for aquaculture, medical, and research purposes. In C. idella, the palate is followed by a well-developed pharyngeal masticatory apparatus. The latter consists of an upper chewing pad superimposing a paired set of teeth. The present study investigated morphological, morphometric, histochemical, and surface ultrastructural changes involving these structures in C. idella juveniles at three different timepoints namely 35 mm total length (TL; 59 days posthatching (dph); fry-fingerling transition), 70 mm TL (90 dph; fingerling), and 210 mm TL ( 365 dph: yearling). The palatal epithelium revealed a constant number of taste buds. However, the height and width of these buds revealed an age-dependent increase. The number of palatal acidic goblet cells increased gradually with age. Enhanced keratinization of pad epithelium, and increased teeth dimensions were age-associated characteristics. Ultrastructurally, the palatal surface of C. idella was slightly papillated at 35 mm TL after which it formed brick-like structural units that tended to cluster into longitudinally paralleled rows toward the palate-pad junction. Goblet cell openings appeared oval at 35 mm TL and became club-shaped by 210 mm TL at which the epithelium appeared compact and heavily coated in mucus. Indentations of pad surface and signs of dental wear and tear were evident ultrastructurally at 70 mm TL and onwards. The current study reports for the first time age-related developmental features of the palate and pharyngeal masticatory apparatus of grass carp. Results of the present work will help to understand aging-associated factors involving the studied fish and other related aquatic species.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted synthetic vaccines have the potential to transform our response to viral outbreaks, yet the design of these vaccines requires a comprehensive knowledge of viral immunogens. Here, we report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) peptides that are naturally processed and loaded onto human leukocyte antigen-II (HLA-II) complexes in infected cells. We identify over 500 unique viral peptides from canonical proteins as well as from overlapping internal open reading frames. Most HLA-II peptides colocalize with known CD4+ T cell epitopes in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, including 2 reported immunodominant regions in the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein. Overall, our analyses show that HLA-I and HLA-II pathways target distinct viral proteins, with the structural proteins accounting for most of the HLA-II peptidome and nonstructural and noncanonical proteins accounting for the majority of the HLA-I peptidome. These findings highlight the need for a vaccine design that incorporates multiple viral elements harboring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes to maximize vaccine effectiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin in the nucleus, restricting the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their target DNA sites. FOXA1 functions as a pioneer TF to bind condensed chromatin and initiate the opening of local chromatin for gene expression. However, the principles of FOXA1 recruitment and how it subsequently unpacks the condensed chromatin remain elusive. Here, we revealed that FOXA1 intrinsically forms submicron-sized condensates through its N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Notably, both IDRs enable FOXA1 to dissolve the condensed chromatin. In addition, the DNA-binding capacity of FOXA1 contributes to its ability to both form condensates and dissolve condensed chromatin. Further genome-wide investigation showed that IDRs enable FOXA1 to bind and unpack the condensed chromatin to regulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. This work provides a principle of how pioneer TFs function to initiate competent chromatin states using their IDRs.

Abstract: Summary
During organ development, tissue stem cells first expand via symmetric divisions and then switch to asymmetric divisions to minimize the time to obtain a mature tissue. In the Drosophila midgut, intestinal stem cells switch their divisions from symmetric to asymmetric at midpupal development to produce enteroendocrine cells. However, the signals that initiate this switch are unknown. Here, we identify the signal as ecdysteroids. In the presence of ecdysone, EcR and Usp promote the expression of E93 to suppress Br expression, resulting in asymmetric divisions. Surprisingly, the primary source of pupal ecdysone is not from the prothoracic gland but from dorsal internal oblique muscles (DIOMs), a group of transient skeletal muscles that are required for eclosion. Genetic analysis shows that DIOMs secrete ecdysteroids during mTOR-mediated muscle remodeling. Our findings identify sequential endocrine and mechanical roles for skeletal muscle, which ensure the timely asymmetric divisions of intestinal stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, an important quality control and recycling process vital for cellular homeostasis, is tightly regulated. The mTORC1 signaling pathway regulates autophagy under conditions of nutrient availability and scarcity. However, how mTORC1 activity is fine-tuned during nutrient availability to allow basal autophagy is unclear. Here, we report that the WD-domain repeat protein MORG1 facilitates basal constitutive autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1 signaling through Rag GTPases. Mechanistically, MORG1 interacts with active Rag GTPase complex inhibiting the Rag GTPase-mediated recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosome. MORG1 depletion in HeLa cells increases mTORC1 activity and decreases autophagy. The autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 binds to MORG1, but MORG1 is not an autophagy substrate. However, p62/SQSTM1 binding to MORG1 upon re-addition of amino acids following amino acid’s depletion precludes MORG1 from inhibiting the Rag GTPases, allowing mTORC1 activation. MORG1 depletion increases cell proliferation and migration. Low expression of MORG1 correlates with poor survival in several important cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of type I interferon (IFN-1) signaling is essential to protect host cells from viral infection. The full spectrum of IFN-I induction requires the activation of a number of cellular factors, including IκB kinase epsilon (IKKϵ). However, the regulation of IKKϵ activation in response to viral infection remains largely unknown. Here, we show that factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (FIH), an asparaginyl hydroxylase, interacts with IKKϵ and catalyzes asparagine hydroxylation of IKKϵ at Asn-254, Asn-700, and Asn-701, resulting in the suppression of IKKϵ activation. FIH-mediated hydroxylation of IKKϵ prevents IKKϵ binding to TBK1 and TRAF3 and attenuates the cIAP1/cIAP2/TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex-catalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of IKKϵ at Lys-416. In addition, Fih-deficient mice and zebrafish are more resistant to viral infection. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized role of FIH in suppressing IKKϵ activation for IFN signaling and antiviral immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
The folate-dependent enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) reversibly converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. Such one-carbon unit production plays a critical role in development, the immune system, and cancer. Using rodent models, here we show that the whole-body SHMT flux acts to net consume rather than produce glycine. Pharmacological inhibition of whole-body SHMT1/2 and genetic knockout of liver SHMT2 elevated circulating glycine levels up to eight-fold. Stable-isotope tracing revealed that the liver converts glycine to serine, which is then converted by serine dehydratase into pyruvate and burned in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In response to diets deficient in serine and glycine, de novo biosynthetic flux was unaltered, but SHMT2- and serine-dehydratase-mediated catabolic flux was lower. Thus, glucose-derived serine synthesis is largely insensitive to systemic demand. Instead, circulating serine and glycine homeostasis is maintained through variable consumption, with liver SHMT2 a major glycine-consuming enzyme.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive molecular analyses of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. Here, we generate multi-omic profiling of 257 primary and 176 metastatic regions from 182 HCC patients. Primary tumors rich in hypoxia signatures facilitated polyclonal dissemination. Genomic divergence between primary and metastatic HCC is high, and early dissemination is prevalent. The remarkable neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity observed in metastases is associated with decreased T cell reactivity, resulting from disruptions to neoantigen presentation. We identify somatic copy number alterations as highly selected events driving metastasis. Subclones without Wnt mutations show a stronger selective advantage for metastasis than those with Wnt mutations and are characterized by a microenvironment rich in activated fibroblasts favoring a pro-metastatic phenotype. Finally, metastases without Wnt mutations exhibit higher enrichment of immunosuppressive B cells that mediate terminal exhaustion of CD8+ T cells via HLA-E:CD94-NKG2A checkpoint axis. Collectively, our results provide a multi-dimensional dissection of the complex evolutionary process of metastasis.

Abstract: Objectives
Silver fluoride (SF) is a preventive and therapeutic option for dental pathological processes involving structural alterations of the hard tissues, either during their formation or those caused by caries or other pathological reasons. This study aimed to compare the biological properties of two commercial SF products, one of them with ammonium (Riva Star; SDF) and the other ammonium-free (Riva Star Aqua; AgF), both with or without potassium iodide (KI), by the assessment of the cytotoxicity of the materials’ eluates.
Methods
Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) were obtained from healthy 18–23-year-old donors. Three dilutions were prepared for the tested materials (0.005%, 0.0005%, and 0.0001%). The following groups were assessed: (AgF, AgF+KI, SDF, SDF+KI, KI, negative control). A series of cytocompatibility assays were performed: MTT assay, IC50 assay, wound healing (migration) assay, cell cytoskeleton staining, analysis of cell apoptosis and necrosis, and reactive oxygen species production. The normality in the distribution of the data was previously confirmed via a Q-Q plot. Statistical significance was tested using one way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test.
Results
The incorporation of KI improved the cytocompatibility of both SF products in terms of viability, migration, morphology, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species production. This difference was higher in the AgF group. The lowest dilutions of SF+KI and AgF+KI showed a similar cytocompatibility to that of the control group (MTT assay (p > 0.05 after 24, 48, and 72 h of culture); migration assay (p > 0.05 after 24, 48, and 72 h of culture); reactive oxygen species production (p > 0.05 after 72 h of culture).
Significance
Riva Star Aqua shows lower cytotoxicity than Riva Star on hDPSCs. It can be considered as a good alternative in the conservative treatment of dental caries and in the preservation and remineralisation of viable dentine tissue.

Abstract: Neuronal activity and neurochemical stimulation trigger spatio-temporal changes in the cytoplasmic concentration of Na+ ions in astrocytes. These changes constitute the substrate for Na+ signalling and are fundamental for astrocytic excitability. Astrocytic Na+ signals are generated by Na+ influx through neurotransmitter transporters, with primary contribution of glutamate transporters, and through cationic channels; whereas recovery from Na+ transients is mediated mainly by the plasmalemmal Na+/K+ ATPase. Astrocytic Na+ signals regulate the activity of plasmalemmal transporters critical for homeostatic function of astrocytes, thus providing real-time coordination between neuronal activity and astrocytic support.

Abstract: Summary
TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein that forms aggregates in various brain disorders. TDP-43 engages in many aspects of RNA metabolism, but its molecular roles in regulating genes and transposable elements (TEs) have not been extensively explored. Chronic TDP-43 knockdown impairs cell proliferation and cellular responses to DNA damage. At the molecular level, TDP-43 chronic deficiency affects gene expression either locally or distally by concomitantly altering the crosstalk between R-loops and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in gene bodies and long-range enhancer/promoter interactions. Furthermore, TDP-43 knockdown induces substantial disease-relevant TE activation by influencing their R-loop and 5hmC homeostasis in a locus-specific manner. Together, our findings highlight the genomic roles of TDP-43 in modulating R-loop-5hmC coordination in coding genes, distal regulatory elements, and TEs, presenting a general and broad molecular mechanism underlying the contributions of proteinopathies to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
In eukaryotes, a primary protein quality control (PQC) process involves the destruction of conformationally misfolded proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Because approximately one-third of eukaryotic proteomes fold and assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before being sent to their destinations, the ER plays a crucial role in PQC. The specific functions and biochemical roles of several E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in ER-associated degradation in mammals, on the other hand, are mainly unknown. We identified 2 E3 ligases, ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 1 (UBR1) and ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 2 (UBR2), which are the key N-recognins in the N-degron pathway and participate in the ER stress response in mammalian cells by modulating their stability. Cells lacking UBR1 and UBR2 are hypersensitive to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Under normal circumstances, these proteins are polyubiquitinated through Lys48-specific linkages and are then degraded by the 26S proteasome. In contrast, when cells are subjected to ER stress, UBR1 and UBR2 exhibit greater stability, potentially as a cellular adaptive response to stressful conditions. Although the precise mechanisms underlying these findings require further investigation, our findings show that cytoplasmic UBR1 and UBR2 have anti-ER stress activities and contribute to global PQC in mammals. These data also reveal an additional level of complexity within the mammalian ER-associated degradation system, implicating potential involvement of the N-degron pathway.

Abstract: Injectable hydrogels are currently a topic of great interest in bone tissue engineering, which could fill irregular bone defects in a short time and avoid traditional major surgery. Herein, we developed an injectable gellan gum (GG)-based hydrogel for bone defect repair by blending nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). In order to acquire an injectable GG-based hydrogel with superior osteogenesis, nHA were blended into GG solution with an optimized proportion. For the aim of endowing this hydrogel capable of angiogenesis, MgSO4 was also incorporated. Physicochemical evaluation revealed that GG-based hydrogel containing 5% nHA (w/v) and 2.5 mM MgSO4 (GG/5%nHA/MgSO4) had appropriate sol-gel transition time, showed a porosity-like structure, and could release magnesium ions for at least 14 days. Rheological studies showed that the GG/5%nHA/MgSO4 hydrogel had a stable structure and repeatable self-healing properties. In-vitro results determined that GG/5%nHA/MgSO4 hydrogel presented superior ability on stimulating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to differentiate into osteogenic linage and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to generate vascularization. In-vivo, GG/5%nHA/MgSO4 hydrogel was evaluated via a rat cranial defect model, as shown by better new bone formation and more neovascularization invasion. Therefore, the study demonstrated that the new injectable hydrogel, is a favorable bioactive GG-based hydrogel, and provides potential strategies for robust therapeutic interventions to improve the repair of bone defect.

Abstract: Summary
Membraneless organelles formed by phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids play diverse cellular functions. Whether and, if yes, how membraneless organelles in ways analogous to membrane-based organelles also undergo regulated fusion and fission is unknown. Here, using a partially reconstituted mammalian postsynaptic density (PSD) condensate as a paradigm, we show that membraneless organelles can undergo phosphorylation-dependent fusion and fission. Without phosphorylation of the SAPAP guanylate kinase domain-binding repeats, the upper and lower layers of PSD protein mixtures form two immiscible sub-compartments in a phase-in-phase organization. Phosphorylation of SAPAP leads to fusion of the two sub-compartments into one condensate accompanied with an increased Stargazin density in the condensate. Dephosphorylation of SAPAP can reverse this event. Preventing SAPAP phosphorylation in vivo leads to increased separation of proteins from the lower and upper layers of PSD sub-compartments. Thus, analogous to membrane-based organelles, membraneless organelles can also undergo regulated fusion and fission.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitylation is catalyzed by coordinated actions of E3 and E2 enzymes. Molecular principles governing many important E3-E2 partnerships remain unknown, including those for RING-family GID/CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligases and their dedicated E2, Ubc8/UBE2H (yeast/human nomenclature). GID/CTLH-Ubc8/UBE2H-mediated ubiquitylation regulates biological processes ranging from yeast metabolic signaling to human development. Here, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemistry, and cell biology reveal this exquisitely specific E3-E2 pairing through an unconventional catalytic assembly and auxiliary interactions 70–100 Å away, mediated by E2 multisite phosphorylation. Rather than dynamic polyelectrostatic interactions reported for other ubiquitylation complexes, multiple Ubc8/UBE2H phosphorylation sites within acidic CK2-targeted sequences specifically anchor the E2 C termini to E3 basic patches. Positions of phospho-dependent interactions relative to the catalytic domains correlate across evolution. Overall, our data show that phosphorylation-dependent multivalency establishes a specific E3-E2 partnership, is antagonistic with dephosphorylation, rigidifies the catalytic centers within a flexing GID E3-substrate assembly, and facilitates substrate collision with ubiquitylation active sites.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic cells of human males and females have 45 chromosomes in common, including the “active” X chromosome. In males the 46th chromosome is a Y; in females it is an “inactive” X (Xi). Through linear modeling of autosomal gene expression in cells from individuals with zero to three Xi and zero to four Y chromosomes, we found that Xi and Y impact autosomal expression broadly and with remarkably similar effects. Studying sex chromosome structural anomalies, promoters of Xi- and Y-responsive genes, and CRISPR inhibition, we traced part of this shared effect to homologous transcription factors—ZFX and ZFY—encoded by Chr X and Y. This demonstrates sex-shared mechanisms by which Xi and Y modulate autosomal expression. Combined with earlier analyses of sex-linked gene expression, our studies show that 21% of all genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cells or fibroblasts change expression significantly in response to Xi or Y chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Eccrine sweat glands are indispensable for human thermoregulation and, similar to other mammalian skin appendages, form from multipotent epidermal progenitors. Limited understanding of how epidermal progenitors specialize to form these vital organs has precluded therapeutic efforts toward their regeneration. Herein, we applied single-nucleus transcriptomics to compare the expression content of wild-type, eccrine-forming mouse skin to that of mice harboring a skin-specific disruption of Engrailed 1 (En1), a transcription factor that promotes eccrine gland formation in humans and mice. We identify two concurrent but disproportionate epidermal transcriptomes in the early eccrine anlagen: one that is shared with hair follicles and one that is En1 dependent and eccrine specific. We demonstrate that eccrine development requires the induction of a dermal niche proximal to each developing gland in humans and mice. Our study defines the signatures of eccrine identity and uncovers the eccrine dermal niche, setting the stage for targeted regeneration and comprehensive skin repair.

Abstract: Summary
Hearing loss is a chronic disease affecting millions of people worldwide, yet no restorative treatment options are available. Although non-mammalian species can regenerate their auditory sensory hair cells, mammals cannot. Birds retain facultative stem cells known as supporting cells that engage in proliferative regeneration when surrounding hair cells die. Here, we investigated gene expression changes in chicken supporting cells during auditory hair cell death. This identified a pathway involving the receptor F2RL1, HBEGF, EGFR, and ERK signaling. We propose a cascade starting with the proteolytic activation of F2RL1, followed by matrix-metalloprotease-mediated HBEGF shedding, and culminating in EGFR-mediated ERK signaling. Each component of this cascade is essential for supporting cell S-phase entry in vivo and is integral for hair cell regeneration. Furthermore, STAT3-phosphorylation converges with this signaling toward upregulation of transcription factors ATF3, FOSL2, and CREM. Our findings could provide a basis for designing treatments for hearing and balance disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) possesses an arsenal of virulence factors to evade host immunity. Previously, we showed that the Mtb protein CpsA, which protects Mtb against the host NADPH oxidase, is required in mice during the first 3 weeks of infection but is thereafter dispensable for full virulence. Using flow cytometry, we find that ΔcpsA Mtb is retained in alveolar macrophages, impaired in recruiting and disseminating into monocyte-derived cells, and more likely to be localized in airway cells than wild-type Mtb. The lungs of ΔcpsA-infected mice also have markedly fewer antigen-specific T cells, indicating a delay in adaptive immunity. Thus, we conclude that CpsA promotes dissemination of Mtb from alveolar macrophages and the airways and generation of an adaptive immune response. Our studies of ΔcpsA Mtb show that a more effective innate immune response against Mtb can be undermined by a corresponding delay in the adaptive immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Sperm gain fertilization competence in the female reproductive tract through a series of biochemical changes and a requisite switch from linear progressive to hyperactive motility. Despite being essential for fertilization, regulation of sperm energy transduction is poorly understood. This knowledge gap confounds interpretation of interspecies variation and limits progress in optimizing sperm selection for assisted reproduction. Here, we developed a model of mouse sperm bioenergetics using metabolic phenotyping data, quantitative microscopy, and spectral flow cytometry. The results define a mechanism of motility regulation by microenvironmental pyruvate. Rather than being consumed as a mitochondrial fuel source, pyruvate stimulates hyperactivation by repressing lactate oxidation and activating glycolysis in the flagellum through provision of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+. These findings provide evidence that the transitions in motility requisite for sperm competence are governed by changes in the metabolic microenvironment, highlighting the unexplored potential of using catabolite combination to optimize sperm selection for fertilization.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have shown that the hypothalamus functions as a control center of aging in mammals that counteracts age-associated physiological decline through inter-tissue communications. We have identified a key neuronal subpopulation in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), marked by Ppp1r17 expression (DMHPpp1r17 neurons), that regulates aging and longevity in mice. DMHPpp1r17 neurons regulate physical activity and WAT function, including the secretion of extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), through sympathetic nervous stimulation. Within DMHPpp1r17 neurons, the phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of Ppp1r17, regulated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG; Prkg1), affect gene expression regulating synaptic function, causing synaptic transmission dysfunction and impaired WAT function. Both DMH-specific Prkg1 knockdown, which suppresses age-associated Ppp1r17 translocation, and the chemogenetic activation of DMHPpp1r17 neurons significantly ameliorate age-associated dysfunction in WAT, increase physical activity, and extend lifespan. Thus, these findings clearly demonstrate the importance of the inter-tissue communication between the hypothalamus and WAT in mammalian aging and longevity control.

Abstract: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) phosphorylates and activates downstream protein kinases, including CaMKI, CaMKIV, PKB/Akt, and AMPK; thus, regulates various Ca2+-dependent physiological and pathophysiological pathways. Further, CaMKKβ/2 in mammalian species comprises multiple alternatively spliced variants; however, their functional differences or redundancy remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize mouse CaMKKβ/2 splice variants (CaMKKβ-3 and β-3x). RT-PCR analyses revealed that mouse CaMKKβ-1, consisting of 17 exons, was predominantly expressed in the brain; whereas, mouse CaMKKβ-3 and β-3x, lacking exon 16 and exons 14/16, respectively, were primarily expressed in peripheral tissues. At the protein level, the CaMKKβ-3 or β-3x variants showed high expression levels in mouse cerebrum and testes. This was consistent with the localization of CaMKKβ-3/-3x in spermatids in seminiferous tubules, but not the localization of CaMKKβ-1. We also observed the co-localization of CaMKKβ-3/-3x with a target kinase, CaMKIV, in elongating spermatids. Biochemical characterization further revealed that CaMKKβ-3 exhibited Ca2+/CaM-induced kinase activity similar to CaMKKβ-1. Conversely, we noted that CaMKKβ-3x impaired Ca2+/CaM-binding ability, but exhibited significantly weak autonomous activity (approximately 500-fold lower than CaMKKβ-1 or β-3) due to the absence of C-terminal of the catalytic domain and a putative residue (Ile478) responsible for the kinase autoinhibition. Nevertheless, CaMKKβ-3x showed the ability to phosphorylate downstream kinases, including CaMKIα, CaMKIV, and AMPKα in transfected cells comparable to CaMKKβ-1 and β-3. Collectively, CaMKKβ-3/-3x were identified as functionally active and could be bona fide CaMKIV-kinases in testes involved in the activation of the CaMKIV cascade in spermatids, resulting in the regulation of spermiogenesis.

Abstract: Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 4 (FNDC4) is a secretory factor that can regulate inflammatory diseases. However, the role of FNDC4 in RA has not been reported so far.
Methods
The expression of FNDC4 in synovial tissues of RA was analyzed by GEO database (GSE55235 dataset). Then, the expression of FNDC4 in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. After constructing FNDC4 overexpression plasmid, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. Then we examined the expression of cytokines related to cell inflammation. Subsequently, the regulatory mechanism of FNDC4 was further discussed. We detected the expression of CCL2 and ERK signaling pathway related proteins downstream of FNDC4. Finally, the mechanism was discussed through the overexpression of FNDC4 and CCL2 and the addition of ERK pathway activator tBHQ.
Results
GEO database showed that FNDC4 expression decreased in synovial tissues of RA. FNDC4 expression was also decreased in RA-FLSs. Overexpression of FNDC4 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of RA-FLSs whereas promoted the cellapoptosis. Overexpression of FNDC4 inhibited the release of inflammatory factors in RA-FLSs. The regulatory effect of FNDC4 is achieved by inhibiting the CCL2/ERK signaling pathway.
Conclusion
FNDC4 reduces inflammation, proliferation, invasion and migration of RA-FLSs in RA by inhibiting CCL2/ERK signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Gene duplication produces the material that fuels evolutionary innovation. The “out-of-testis” hypothesis suggests that sperm competition creates selective pressure encouraging the emergence of new genes in male germline, but the somatic expression and function of the newly evolved genes are not well understood. We systematically mapped the expression of young duplicate genes throughout development in Caenorhabditis elegans using both whole-organism and single-cell transcriptomic data. Based on the expression dynamics across developmental stages, young duplicate genes fall into three clusters that are preferentially expressed in early embryos, mid-stage embryos, and late-stage larvae. Early embryonic genes are involved in protein degradation and develop essentiality comparable to the genomic average. In mid-to-late embryos and L4-stage larvae, young genes are enriched in intestine, epidermal cells, coelomocytes, and amphid chemosensory neurons. Their molecular functions and inducible expression indicate potential roles in innate immune response and chemosensory perceptions, which may contribute to adaptation outside of the sperm.

Abstract: Background
RING finger protein 135 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and is associated with drug resistance.
Methods
Bioinformatics analysis showed that RNF135 was significantly differentially expressed in colorectal cancer. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of RNF135. Immunohistochemical analysis were used to measure the expression of RNF135 and Ki-67.
Results
The expression of RNF135 was up-regulated in human tissue samples and colorectal cancer and was positively correlated with Ki-67. Compared with oxaliplatin sensitive patients, RNF135 expression levels were higher in the tissue of resistant patients. The regulatory effect of RNF135 on colorectal cancer cells was further investigated in vitro. Therefore, inhibition of autophagy by down-regulating RNF135 can partially increase its susceptibility to oxaliplatin.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are the foundation of cell therapy. Differences in gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin conformation, which could affect differentiation capacity, have been identified between iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Less is known about whether DNA replication timing, a process linked to both genome regulation and genome stability, is efficiently reprogrammed to the embryonic state. To answer this, we compare genome-wide replication timing between ESCs, iPSCs, and cells reprogrammed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs). While NT-ESCs replicate their DNA in a manner indistinguishable from ESCs, a subset of iPSCs exhibits delayed replication at heterochromatic regions containing genes downregulated in iPSCs with incompletely reprogrammed DNA methylation. DNA replication delays are not the result of gene expression or DNA methylation aberrations and persist after cells differentiate to neuronal precursors. Thus, DNA replication timing can be resistant to reprogramming and influence the quality of iPSCs.

Abstract: Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) frequently induces cognitive impairments. Investigating the role of sevoflurane postconditioning (SPC) in HIBD, we conducted experiments involving HIBD modeling, SPC treatment, and interventions with the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 or the PERK activator CCT020312, administered 30 min before modeling, followed by SPC treatment. Behavioral testing using the Morris water maze test and Neurological Deficiency Scale (NDS) was conducted. Additionally, Nissl staining assessed hippocampal CA1 area neuronal density, TUNEL staining evaluated hippocampal CA1 area neuronal apoptosis, and Western blot determined hippocampal CA1 area protein levels, including Bax, Bcl-2, p-PERK/PERK, p-eIF2/eIF2, ATF4, CHOP, GRP78, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein levels. Following SPC treatment, HIBD rats exhibited improved spatial learning and memory abilities, reduced neuronal apoptosis, increased neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area, elevated Bcl-2 protein level, decreased Bax protein levels, and decreased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway related proteins (p-PERK/PERK, p-eIF2/eIF2, ATF4, CHOP and GRP78). Pre-modeling treatment with the PERK inhibitor treatment improved outcomes in HIBD rats. However, pre-modeling treatment with the PERK activator CCT020312 counteracted the protective effects of SPC against HIBD in rats. In conclusion, SPC alleviates neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus CA1 area of HIBD rats by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway PERK/ATF4/CHOP, thereby mitigating HIBD in rats.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic autoimmune disease. Among them, abnormal proliferation, migration and vascularization of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are the main pathological basis of persistent synovitis and bone destruction in RA. In the current study, we attempted to find effective molecular mechanisms for the treatment of RA by investigating RA-FLS. Firstly, the study was conducted to identify the potential target gene PTEN and its related signaling pathway through bioinformatics analysis. Subsequently, the target gene PTEN overexpression was regulated by cell transfection. The expression of FOXO signaling factors and autophagy-related proteins were detected by western blotting assay. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 and EdU assays. Inflammation level was detected by ELISA. Cell migration and invasion were detected using wound healing assay and transwell chamber assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. The results showed that overexpression of PTEN activated FOXO1 signaling in RA-FLS, and regulated autophagy, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the disease. In conclusion, PTEN might provide an effective therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis by mediating the FOXO1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) is a common immune system that uses cyclic oligonucleotide signals to limit phage replication. In turn, phages encode anti-CBASS (Acb) proteins such as Acb2, which can sequester some cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and limit downstream effector activation. Here, we identified that Acb2 sequesters many CDNs produced by CBASS systems and inhibits stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activity in human cells. Surprisingly, the Acb2 hexamer also binds with high affinity to CBASS cyclic trinucleotides (CTNs) 3′3′3′-cyclic AMP-AMP-AMP and 3′3′3′-cAAG at a distinct site from CDNs. One Acb2 hexamer can simultaneously bind two CTNs and three CDNs. Phage-encoded Acb2 provides protection from type III-C CBASS that uses cA3 signaling molecules. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of >2,000 Acb2 homologs encoded by diverse phages and prophages revealed that most are expected to bind both CTNs and CDNs. Altogether, Acb2 sequesters nearly all known CBASS signaling molecules through two distinct binding pockets and therefore serves as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of cGAS-based immunity.

Abstract: Accelerating the repair of damaged endothelium can effectively inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis (AS). Transient receptor potential channel TRPM4 is a non-selective cation channel activated by internal Ca2+, which is expressed in endothelial cells. This study aimed to reveal the potential role of TRPM4 in AS along with the mechanism. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) induced by ox-LDL was regarded as an in vitro model. The impacts of TRPM4 knockdown on cellular inflammation response, oxidative stress, normal endothelial function and lipid peroxidation were evaluated. Given that ferroptosis promotes AS progression, the effects of TRPM4 on intracellular iron ions and ferroptosis-related proteins was determined. Afterwards, HCAECs were treated with ferroptosis inducer erastin, and the influence of ferroptosis in the cellular model was revealed. TRPM4 was elevated in response to ox-LDL treatment in HCAECs. TRPM4 knockdown reduced the inflammation response, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation caused by ox-LDL, and maintained the normal function of HCAECs. Erastin treatment destroyed the impacts of TRPM4 knockdown that are beneficial for cells to resist ox-LDL, showing the enhancement of the above adverse factors. Together, this study found that TRPM4 knockdown reduced ox-LDL-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysfunction in HCAECs, possibly via a mechanism involving Fe2+ and ferroptosis-related proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular signaling involves a large repertoire of membrane receptors operating in overlapping spatiotemporal regimes and targeting many common intracellular effectors. However, both the molecular mechanisms and the physiological roles of crosstalk between receptors, especially those from different superfamilies, are poorly understood. We find that the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) TrkB and the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) together mediate hippocampal synaptic plasticity in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Activated TrkB enhances constitutive mGluR5 activity to initiate a mode switch that drives BDNF-dependent sustained, oscillatory Ca2+ signaling and enhanced MAP kinase activation. This crosstalk is mediated, in part, by synergy between Gβγ, released by TrkB, and Gαq-GTP, released by mGluR5, to enable physiologically relevant RTK/GPCR crosstalk.
