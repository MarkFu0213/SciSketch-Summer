Abstract: Self-switching smart windows, which can be switched between the transparent and opaque states by ambient conditions, have applications in buildings, automobiles, and switchable sunglasses. In particular, technologies for transmittance control without light scattering are highly desirable owing to their ability to control the throughput of sunlight and solar heat through a window without blocking the view. In this study, a self-shading window based on liquid crystals doped with push-pull azobenzene with a haze-free opaque state for transmittance control is demonstrated. For the realization of the haze-free opaque state (or a low-transmittance state), the isotropic phase was used, which can be induced either thermally or optically.

Abstract: Soiling of optical surfaces due to sand and dust accumulation is the main cause for decreased efficiency of concentrating solar power and photovoltaic installations in desert areas. Nanostructured coatings with tailored surface roughness can reduce the rate of soil accumulation and maintain the high optical performance of the solar mirrors and cover glass. Here, we investigate the correlation between the size and structure of the surface features of the coating and its anti-soiling and optical properties. To control the morphology of the surface features we developed two types of coating: (1) based on small size (30–50 nm) silica particles with nanostructured surface and (2) based on unstructured nanoparticles with bimodal size distribution (80 and 35 nm). We tailored the surface features of the coatings to achieve synergistic improvements over different length-scales and thus decrease the adhesion force between the soil particles and the surface. Adhesion force measurements were performed using atomic force microscopy. The adhesion force and energy required to separate a silica particle from the surface of coated solar glass was significantly lower than the respective values from the surface of uncoated solar glass. A falling sand abrasion test, modeled after the procedure in ASTM D968, was performed. The optical properties of coated and uncoated solar glass were measured before and after the soiling test. Coated solar mirror samples were tested in the field. The results of the field test provided evidence that the anti-soiling coating is effective at reducing soiling and improving the specular reflectances of the coated mirrors. The use of the developed anti-soiling coating can be extended to other power-grid applications where reducing the soil accumulation is valuable.

Abstract: Telmisartan broadly used for the treatment of hypertension that is also known for its anticancer properties. TRAIL has the potential to kill tumor cells with minimal toxicity in normal cells by binding to death receptors, DR4 and DR5. Unfortunately, these TRAIL-death receptors have failed as most human cancers are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated telmisartan as a novel TRAIL-DR5-targeting agent with the aim of rendering TRAIL-based cancer therapies more active. Herein, we demonstrated that telmisartan could sensitize TRAIL and enhance NSCLC tumor cell death. The molecular mechanism includes the blocking of AMPK phosphorylation causes inhibition of autophagy flux by telmisartan resulting in ROS generation leading to death receptor (DR5) upregulation and subsequent activation of the caspase cascade by TRAIL treatment. Furthermore, using chloroquine and siATG5 significantly enhances ROS production and application of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) rescues the cells undergoing apoptosis by abrogating the expression of DR5 and finally the caspase cascade. Additionally, NAC treatment also maintains autophagy flux and makes the cells unresponsive to TRAIL. In summary, telmisartan in combination with TRAIL exhibits enhanced cytotoxic capacity toward lung cancer cells, thereby providing the potential for effective and novel therapeutic approaches to treat lung cancer.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is a severe brain illness that causes vast numbers of nerve cells in the brain to die, driven by the production and deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) generally lack stable structures and are abundant in nature. Aβ peptide is a well-known IDP with a wide range of oligomeric forms. Dysfunctions in Aβ lead to oligomerization, formation of fibrils, and neurodegenerative disorders or other forms of dementia. In this study, we used replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to elucidate the roles of different osmolytes, particularly urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), to study shifts in IDP populations. REMD samples the conformational space efficiently and at physiologically relevant temperatures, compared to conventional molecular dynamics that sample at a constant temperature. Urea is known to minimize the aggregation process, while TMAO is beneficial for its stabilizing action. The two osmolytes displayed characteristic effects on Aβ peptides and resulted in progressive modulation of conformations. The present study underlines the hypothesis of “modulation of conformational ensembles” to explain the regulation and aggregation of IDPs.

Abstract: The switching time is one of the key parameters used to assess the performance of an electrochromic material or device. In spite of its importance, there is currently no standard for how this parameter is defined, and as a result, it is difficult to compare switching time data between different research groups, and to quantify and assess reported improvements. We propose a standard method for reporting electrochromic switching times, based on straightforward experimental fittings resulting in an analytical expression that can directly correlate obtainable optical contrast values with their corresponding switching times. This analytical expression makes it possible to unambiguously define the performance of an electrochromic material or device using two parameters: a full-switch contrast and a time constant.

Abstract: An alkaline earth boro-aluminosilicate glass (Eagle XG), a soda-lime glass, and a light-weight polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) foil, used as typical substrates for photovoltaics, were treated by an energetic proton beam (3 MeV, dose 106–107 Gy) corresponding to approx. 30 years of operation at low Earth orbit. Properties of the irradiated substrates were characterized by atomic force microscopy, optical absorption, optical diffuse reflectance, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Minimal changes of optical and morphological properties are detected on the bare Eagle XG glass, whereas the bare PET foil exhibits pronounced increase in optical absorption, generation of photoluminescence, as well as mechanical bending. On the other hand, the identical substrates coated with Indium-tin-oxide (ITO), which is a typical material for transparent electrodes in photovoltaics, exhibit significantly higher resistance to the modifications by protons while ITO structural and electronic properties remain unchanged. The experimental results are discussed considering a potential application of these materials for missions in space.

Abstract: The origins of an increase in the series resistance of PERC multicrystalline silicon solar cells due to post-firing thermal processes are investigated. This effect has been shown to be capable of reducing the fill factor of finished cells by up to 20%ABS, severely degrading their performance. It is observed that electric currents applied either during or after these thermal processes can greatly alter the series resistance, either causing it to increase by more than an order of magnitude or suppressing the effect entirely. It is demonstrated that this behavior is in good agreement with the expected interactions of hydrogen with dopants and electric fields within silicon wafers. It is therefore speculated that at least part of the observed increase in resistance is due to the motion of hydrogen within the cell itself.

Abstract: We investigate the passivation of crystalline Si (c-Si) surfaces by phosphorus oxide (POx) thin films deposited in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor and capped in-situ by ALD Al2O3. Passivation is demonstrated on both n- and p-type (100) Si surfaces, and for POx/Al2O3 stacks deposited at both 25 °C and 100 °C. In contrast to Al2O3 alone, POx/Al2O3 passivation is activated already by annealing at temperatures as low as 250 °C in N2 in all cases. Best results were obtained after annealing at 350 °C and 450 °C for films deposited at 25 °C and 100 °C respectively, with similar implied open-circuit voltages of 723 and 724 mV on n-type (100) Si. In the latter case an outstandingly low surface recombination velocity of 1.7 cm/s and saturation current density of 3.3 fA/cm2 were obtained on 1.35 Ω cm material. Passivation of p-type Si appeared somewhat poorer, with surface recombination velocity of 13 cm/s on 2.54 Ω cm substrates. Passivation was found to be independent of POx film thickness for films of 4 nm and above, and was observed to be stable during prolonged annealing up to 500 °C. This excellent passivation performance on n-type Si is attributed partly to an unusually large positive fixed charge in the range of 3–5 × 1012 cm−2 (determined from capacitance–voltage measurements) for stacks deposited at both temperatures, which is significantly larger than that exhibited by existing positively charged passivation materials such as SiNx. Indeed, passivation performance on n-type silicon is shown to compare favourably to state-of-the-art results reported for PECVD SiNx. POx/Al2O3 stacks thus represent a highly effective positively charged passivation scheme for c-Si, with potential for n-type surface passivation and selective doping applications.

Abstract: Both multicrystalline and Czochralski (Cz) silicon substrates are known to suffer from various mechanisms of light-induced degradation (LID), including copper-related LID (Cu-LID). Past studies on Cu-LID have mostly been performed on unprocessed wafers, omitting the impact of the solar cell process on the copper distribution. Here, we carefully contaminate Cz-substrates of different quality with different amounts of copper and process the substrates into complete industrial Cz-Si PERC solar cells, reaching a comprehensive mapping of the impact of Cu-LID for the PV industry. The results show that both the copper contamination level and Cz crystal quality are critical factors affecting the extent of Cu-LID. Most importantly, we show that copper can result in significant concentrations in the bulk of the finished PERC cells after being exposed to only trace surface contamination. Consequently, even a small local copper contamination area (~ 3–4 cm2) is sufficient to induce strong LID in the full-sized (156 × 156 mm2) cell parameters, resulting e.g. in ~7% relative efficiency loss during light soaking. The corresponding short circuit current density decreases by up to a factor of two in the contaminated areas.

Abstract: The eutectic mixture Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 is investigated as a high temperature heat transfer fluid and storage medium alternative for molten salt solar thermal power plants. This salt has an operating temperature range of 400–700 °C, enabling the use of higher temperature/efficiency power cycles. However, this carbonate mixture is known to thermally decompose in air. This study evaluates the thermal stability of the salt mixture under different cover gases: air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and an 80/20 carbon dioxide/air mixture. Initial characterization is performed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), followed by larger scale testing in a custom-made reactor to simulate conditions closer to its practical use. The results show improved thermal stability with a CO2 atmosphere. The decomposition kinetics under different cover gases are estimated from TGA data. However, larger-scale, longer duration experiments show much slower decomposition rates compared to the classical TGA approach. These findings indicate that the main contribution to mass loss in TGA is due to vaporization rather than thermal decomposition. Thus, a proper evaluation of the molten salt´s thermal stability can only be obtained from reactor experiments where vaporization is inhibited. Very long induction periods (of the order of days) are observed, suggesting that the kinetic decomposition mechanism is a nucleation and growth type. Other considerations for future plants incorporating these high temperature salts are discussed.

Abstract: As hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic chemical emitted in large quantities from both natural sources and industrial processes, resource utilization of H2S has become a hotspot research in recent years. We report herein, synthesis and characterization of a highly active In2S3/CuS nanosheet composite photocatalyst via a facile one-pot solvothermal route. The as-obtained In2S3/CuS composite show a special hierarchical structure and remarkable visible light absorption ability with an absorption edge of 785 nm. Its remarkable light absorption ability enables it to fully absorb the visible light. The as-obtained In2S3/CuS composite exhibits a superior visible-light photocatalytic activity and long-term durability in H2S splitting. As a result, a maximum H2 production rate of 14950 μmol g−1 h−1 over In2S3/CuS composite has been achieved even without any noble metal co-catalysts, which is 404 and 87 fold higher than that of over bare β-In2S3 and Cu9S5, respectively. The corresponding apparent quantum yield (AQY) of In2S3/CuS at 420 nm is 9.3%. The excellent photocatalytic activity depends on the chemical structure, phase, optical nature and folded nanosheet like geometry of In2S3/CuS composite, which facilitated electron transfer between interfaces of β-In2S3 and CuS, and improved the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Therefore, In2S3/CuS composite could serve as an efficient and practical visible-light response photocatalyst for H2 production from toxic and corrosive H2S.

Abstract: The stability of solar selective absorber coatings in hostile environments (e.g., humid condition, corrosive medium, longer exposure at elevated temperature) needs to be critically assessed to ensure durability of such coatings. In the present work, magnetron sputtered W/WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3-based absorber coating with a high absorptance (0.958) and low emittance (82 °C) has been tested in humid and corrosive environments. The selectivity (absorptance/emittance) of the coating did not change after keeping it in 95% humidity at 37 °C for 400 h. Corrosion study in 3.5% NaCl solution reveals that this novel multilayer coating has a better corrosion resistance than that of uncoated stainless steel (SS) substrate. The nanoindentation test on the coating indicates that it has a hardness of 9.6 ± 0.5 GPa. The performance of the coating did not degrade after heat treatment at 350 °C in air for 1000 h. Additionally, the activation energy for degradation has been determined to predict the stability of the coating at high temperature. Further, the normal spectral emissivity of the tandem solar absorber was measured in the full angular range from 200 to 500 °C. The results of emissivity measurements by varying observation angles are analysed using numerical integration to obtain the total hemispherical emissivity. In summary, W/WAlN/WAlON/Al2O3 stack is an attractive candidate absorber coating for photo-thermal conversion systems.

Abstract: We have prepared an efficient ternary polymer solar cell incorporating a poly(indacenodithiophene)-based conjugated polymer (PIDTBT), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2´,3´-d´]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b´]-dithiophene (ITIC). Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed that intermolecular interactions between the PC71BM and ITIC units disrupted the formation of large ITIC crystals. The ITIC and PC71BM components formed compatible domains that dispersed well within the PIDTBT matrix, providing optimized ternary blends for efficient carrier transport and led to greater photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. Compared with the pre-optimized PC71BM binary device, the ternary device displayed an improvement in short circuit current density (Jsc) from 12.0 ± 0.3 to 14.2 ± 0.5 mA cm–2, due primarily to complementary light harvesting in the visible and near-infrared regions; as a result, the device performance improved by 20%—from 5.5 ± 0.2 to 6.6 ± 0.1% under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm–2) irradiation. Furthermore, the ternary cell exhibited outstanding long-term stability, with its performance remaining high (at 6.8%) after storage for 410 days in a glove box (ISOS-D-1 (shelf lifetime)).

Abstract: In this paper, we compare the optical and electrical performance of different Fresnel-based HCPV systems equipped with different refractive secondary optical elements (SOEs) through both optical modelling and experiments. The SOEs (designed with a thorough optical modelling): i) Dielectric-cross compound-parabolic-concentrator (DCCPC), ii) (SIngle-Lens-Optical element) SILO-Pyramid, iii) Refractive truncated pyramid (RTP) and, iv) Trumpet; are fabricated (made of PMMA) and mounted on commercially available concentrator solar cell assemblies. An indoor characterisation of all these HCPV units, under controlled conditions, using a CPV Solar Simulator “Helios 3198” is performed. The angular behaviour of the HCPV units is predicted properly, in general, although the measured optical efficiencies result in lower values than in the optical simulations. The reasons for those differences are explored through some fabrication and mounting imperfections detected, among others. The impact of changed irradiance and spectrum is analysed separately. No high dependence in the efficiency or in the acceptance angle, in terms of the maximum power point, was found due to changes in the irradiance. For changed spectral conditions, the decrease in the fill factor results in up to around 4% lower than the maximum values. Moreover, the impact of the spectrum on the acceptance angle was analysed. The results showed an increment of the power-based acceptance angle for blue-rich spectra for the HCPV units with SOEs working as light pipes. From the results of efficiency and acceptance angle, none of the SOEs produces a notably performance than the others.

Abstract: In order to evaluate the quantum efficiency and to establish the mechanism of down-conversion processes in Bi3+−Yb3+ and Ce3+−Yb3+ co-doped YAG (Y3Al5O12) and GGG (Gd3Al5O12) garnets, direct measurements of quantum yield (QY) were performed along with studies of photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE), and photoluminescence decay kinetics. The studied materials have been prepared either in the form of powders synthesized by the sol-gel method or single crystalline films grown by the liquid phase epitaxy method. Concentrations of Bi3+, Ce3+ and Yb3+ ions in the studied epitaxial films were estimated using X-ray diffraction and optical absorption techniques. The obtained results testify a non-cooperative energy transfer mechanism for the Ce3+–Yb3+ co-doped YAG with a conversion ratio (which should be 2.0 for an ideal quantum cutting mechanism) less than 1.0. At the same time, for Bi3+–Yb3+ co-doped YAG and GGG this conversion ratio was found to be close to 2.0, suggesting quantum cutting via cooperative energy transfer from one Bi3+ ion to two Yb3+ ions.

Abstract: All-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites have attracted intensive interest as light absorbing materials due to their large absorption coefficient, long charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, especially they show better stability than their organic and inorganic hybrid counterparts. Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance self-powered CsPbBr3 perovskite photodetector based on an all-inorganic structure. Our self-powered devices show high performance with the responsivity of 0.3 A/W, detectivity of 1.15 × 1013 cm Hz1/2/W and on/off ratio of 4.5 × 102. Notably, ZnO nanorods as a scaffold, which functions as a protection layer, are used to effectively enhance the stability and durability of perovskite photodetectors. Our all-inorganic device exhibits improvement of the stability in the air, has a certain high temperature endurance and shows the anti-corrosion ability to water and alcohol. These good performances and high stability present a potential application in harsh environments without external power sources.

Abstract: T2DM is a global health problem that seriously lowers the quality of life and insulin resistance makes a considerable contribution to the pathophysiology of T2DM. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators in glucose and lipid metabolism. However, comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in db/db mice skeletal muscle and their potential roles involved in skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified 331 lncRNAs, 172 upregulated and 159 downregulated (|fold change|>2, q<0.05), differentially expressed in db/db mice skeletal muscle. Gene Ontology analysis, Pathway analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of network gene expression revealed the potential functions of dysregulated lncRNAs may involve skeletal muscle function, fatty acid metabolism and the PPAR signaling pathway. In addition, differentially expressed lncRNAs were verified in skeletal muscle from the widely known IR mouse models (db/db and ob/ob mice). Further validation of lncRNAs in C2C12 myotubes exposed with various concentrations of palmitate uncovered that lncRNAs were responsive to palmitate exposure at the high concentrations (0.5mM and 0.75mM). Coexpression analysis revealed the key lncRNA-mRNA interactions and indicated a potential regulatory role of lncRNAs. Moreover, we characterized two candidate lncRNAs Gm15441 and 3110045C21Rik by a comprehensive examination of their genomic context and validated their expression with neighboring genes (Txnip and Ddr2) by the Spearman correlation analysis. Collectively, these findings improve our understanding of lncRNAs that mediate skeletal muscle insulin resistance in diabetes and represent potential molecular therapeutic targets to improve insulin sensitivity and associated metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Unusually high carrier lifetimes are measured by photoconductance decay on n-type Czochralski-grown silicon wafers of different doping concentrations, passivated using plasma-assisted atomic-layer-deposited aluminum oxide (Al2O3) on both wafer surfaces. The measured effective lifetimes significantly exceed the intrinsic lifetime limit previously reported in the literature. Several prerequisites have to be fulfilled to allow the measurement of such high lifetimes on Al2O3-passivated n-type silicon wafers: (i) large-area wafers are required to minimize the impact of edge recombination via the Al2O3-charge-induced inversion layer, (ii) an exceptionally homogeneous Al2O3 surface passivation is required, and (iii) very thick silicon wafers are needed. Based on our lifetime measurements on n-type silicon wafers of different doping concentrations, we introduce a new parameterization of the intrinsic lifetime for n-type crystalline silicon. This new parameterization has implications concerning the maximum reachable efficiency of n-type silicon solar cells, which is larger than assumed before.

Abstract: To advance knowledge of the beneficial effects of K in Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) photovoltaic (PV) absorbers, recent Cu-K-In-Se phase growth studies have been extended to PV performance. First, the effect of distributing K throughout bulk Cu1-xKxInSe2 absorbers at low K/(K+Cu) compositions (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.30) was studied. Efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were greatly enhanced for x ~ 0.07, resulting in an officially-measured 15.0%-efficient solar cell, matching the world record CuInSe2 efficiency. The improvements were a result of reduced interface and bulk recombination, relative to CuInSe2 (x ~ 0). However, higher x compositions had reduced efficiency, short-circuit current density (JSC), and FF due to greatly increased interface recombination, relative to the x ~ 0 baseline. Next, the effect of confining K at the absorber/buffer interface at high K/(K+Cu) compositions (0.30 ≤ x ≤ 0.92) was researched. Previous work showed that these surface layer growth conditions produced CuInSe2 with a large phase fraction of KInSe2. After optimization (75 nm surface layer with x ~ 0.41), these KInSe2 surface samples exhibited increased efficiency (officially 14.9%), VOC, and FF as a result of decreased interface recombination. The KInSe2 surfaces had features similar to previous reports for KF post-deposition treatments (PDTs) used in world record CIGS solar cells—taken as indirect evidence that KInSe2 can form during these PDTs. Both the bulk and surface growth processes greatly reduced interface recombination. However, the KInSe2 surface had higher K levels near the surface, greater lifetimes, and increased inversion near the buffer interface, relative to the champion bulk Cu1-xKxInSe2 absorber. These characteristics demonstrate that K may benefit PV performance by different mechanisms at the surface and in the absorber bulk.

Abstract: Poor qualities of ZnMgO thin films are likely to be obtained at higher Mg content, which can decrease the performance of ZnMgO-based devices. This study focuses on improving the qualities of ZnMgO thin films to increase the performance of CdTe solar cell. It is found that the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment increases the crystallinity, eliminates defects and improves the conductivity of ZnMgO thin films. These are helpful to suppress the recombination caused by bulk and interface defects as well as to reduce the cell's series resistance. The Fermi level moves close to conduction band and both the conduction and valence band energy shift lower relative to band energy of CdSSeTe film after RTA, which could not only increase the built-in voltage but also enhance the electron transport and block the hole recombination. As a result, the efficiency of CdTe solar cells is enhanced when using the RTA-treated ZnMgO, with maxium power conversion efficiency reaching values of 15.7%, which are much higher than those of the cells with the as-grown ZnMgO (11.6%). RTA is proved to be one of the excellent methods to control the properties of ZnMgO for improving the performance of CdTe solar cell.

Abstract: The main DNA repair pathways, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR), are complementary to each other; hence, interruptions of the NHEJ pathway can favor HDR. Improving HDR efficiency in animal primary fibroblasts can facilitate the generation of gene knock-in animals with agricultural and biomedical values by somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this study, we used siRNA to suppress the expression of Ku70 and Ku80, which are the key factors in NHEJ pathway, to investigate the effect of Ku silencing on the HDR efficiency in pig fetal fibroblasts. Down-regulation of Ku70 and Ku80 resulted in the promotion of the frequencies of multiple HDR pathways, including homologous recombination, single strand annealing, and single-stranded oligonucleotide-mediated DNA repair. We further evaluated the effects of Ku70 and Ku80 silencing on promoting HR-mediated knock-in efficiency in two porcine endogenous genes and found a significant increase in the amount of knock-in cells in Ku-silenced fibroblasts compared with control. The RNA interference strategy will benefit the generation of cell lines and organisms with precise genetic modifications.

Abstract: This paper outlines the development of fully screen-printed, uniformly diffused, bifacial, n-type silicon solar cells produced using a lean processing sequence and industry-standard equipment. An average batch efficiency of 21.4% was measured at standard test conditions for an optimised bifacial cell batch (i.e. illumination on the front surface only). The results of open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) loss analyses are presented for select batches. By targeting reductions in the largest recombination components, optimised batch VOC was increased by 15 mV compared to the baseline case. The two largest recombination components limiting VOC in optimised devices are front contact recombination and passivated rear surface recombination. The largest FF loss components for optimised devices are the emitter sheet resistance and front contact resistance.

Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) inhibition sensitizes APL cells to anti-tumor effect of arsenic trioxide via restriction of NF-κB axis: Shedding new light on resistance to Aprepitant,

Abstract: While a batch of efforts are fastened on synthesizing the novel targeted anti-cancer agents, recent investigations have achieved a breakthrough in identifying a favorable anti-tumor activity for some supportive drugs, which their safety have been confirmed thus far. The results of the present study highlighted the efficacy of Aprepitant, an oral antagonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), against both APL (NB4) and pre-B ALL (Nalm-6) cell lines; however, a differential sensitivity pattern was found in these cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the molecular mechanisms of resistance to Aprepitant have been investigated and, herein, we proposed that the effectiveness of Aprepitant could be overshadowed, at least partially, through over-activated nuclear factor-κB in Nalm-6 pre-B ALL cells. In contrast to Nalm-6, the cytotoxic property of Aprepitant in NB4 was divulged at the lower concentrations. Of particular interest, we found that the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor became even more evident in the synergistic experiments, where an enhanced reduction in viability was noted after treatment of NB4 cells with ATO-plus-Aprepitant. The stimulatory effect of NK1R inhibition on ATO cytotoxicity is probably mediated through up-regulation of p73, which can subsequently engage p21 and NF-κB pathway via transcriptional suppression of c-Myc. Taken together, the present study suggests that inhibition of NK1R using Aprepitant, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia, especially APL, that may be clinically accessible in the near future.

Abstract: A Multi-Angle (MA) method was proposed to determine the high-temperature spectral properties of high- transparency and low-absorption materials. This method overcomes the experimental difficulties of temperature gradient and low recognition. Through just rotating the sample to tune the incident/transmitted angle, this method can provide multiple distinctly different and independent transmittances, and there is barely any influence on the temperature field of the sample. Measurements are performed on an ultraviolet fused silica between 0.8 and 5 µm for several high temperatures, using a modified FTIR system coupling with a heating cell. Based on the transmittance data, a genetic-algorithm-based least-square method was used to extract the refractive index and the absorption index. In this identifying process, a Monte-Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) method was adopted to predict the experimental value. The genetic algorithm was used to search and optimize the association of the indexes of refraction and absorption. Using this experimental identifying method, temperature and frequency dependence of transmission properties of the UV fused silica up to 1800 K were obtained. The spectral refractive index gradually decreases with wavelength and slightly rise with increasing temperature. The spectral absorption index is also dependent on wavelength as well as temperature. As the absorption bands broadening with the increasing temperature, three absorption peaks all shift toward longer wavelengths and vary differently from 1200 to 1800 K. The indexes of refraction and absorption can be used for predicting the transmitting rates of fused silica windows based on different entrance angles at high temperatures.

Abstract: Recently, Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite compounds are at the forefront of research, due to their unique and exciting optical properties, besides the potential applications in photovoltaic systems. Possessing broad absorption spectrum, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields, large Stokes shifts between their absorption and emission bands and thus low self-absorption loss, high stability under illumination and oxygen exposure and tunable emission spectra, through halogen substitution, are advantages of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites as active media in luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs). In this work, Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br and I), are investigated as the active medium in planar and bulk form of LSCs. Using spectroscopic and photovoltaic measurements, variation of optical properties and device performance, with different halogen sources in the perovskite based LSC precursors, are monitored. Their superior performance is attributed to the high quantum yield of the Halide Perovskites. The obtained results reveal that to find a suitable condition for effective LSC, it is necessary to investigate the appropriate halogen atom in the synthesized perovskite, as well as the concentration of halide perovskite in LSC. It was found that CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite, with 2.0 wt% perovskite concentration in Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), leads to the highest efficiency, with the least dissipative effect in LSC. The efficiency of coated Si PV cell is increased about 90% more, compared to an uncoated cell.

Abstract: The structural, optical, and electrical properties of molybdenum (Mo) layers play a major role in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell performance. The Mo layer works as a transport gate for diffusion of alkali ion from the soda-lime glass substrate to the back contact in CIGS solar cells. In the present work, Mo back contacts are controlled to exhibit two different orientations: (110)-oriented and randomly oriented. The influence of these orientations on CIGS absorbers and resulting solar cells is investigated. In situ thermo-Raman spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry results indicate that the greater amount of alkali ions are found in the CIGS absorber with randomly oriented Mo back contact than in the (110)-orientated Mo back contact. The resulting different Na incorporations significantly affect the performance of the resulting devices. Devices with the randomly oriented Mo back contact exhibit superior device performances to the devices with (110)-oriented Mo back contact. With comprehensive device characterizations, an alkali ion release determined by the orientation of the Mo back contact affects the recombination mechanism in the CIGS bulk and the back contact properties at the CIGS/Mo interface.

Abstract: In this work we present a theoretical analysis of charge carriers transport mechanisms in IBC-SHJ solar cells. The concepts of contact and transport selectivity are correlated through the band bending at c-Si interface and are used to identify thin-film silicon parameters affecting fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC). Additionally, the transport of carriers is associated to energy barriers at the conduction band for electrons and at the valence band for holes. In case of p-type contact, the transport of holes is mainly affected by activation energy and band gap of the p-type layer and work function of the TCO. In case of n-type contact, the activation energy and work function of the doped layer impact the most on transport of electrons. Selective transport is improved by maximizing the collection of majority carrier in each doped contact stack while blocking minority carriers. In particular, low activation energy values of doped layers are crucial to minimize energy barriers for majority carriers and increase the band bending at c-Si interface. Simulation results based on TCAD Sentaurus reveal that the FF increases as the activation energy of the doped layers is reduced. Also, for the p-type contact, the bandgap of p-type layer strongly affects the band bending at c-Si interface. Particularly, widening the bandgap of p-type layer enhances passivation and transport in terms of VOC and FF but work function mismatch between the p-type layer and the related transparent conductive oxide (TCO) strongly increases as bandgap increases. This possibly makes the device less performant because it is more sensitive to activation energy of the p-layer in combination with the choice of the proper TCO. Considering realistic deposited layers, a wide bandgap p-type layer, in combination with low activation energy, potentially improves hole collection leading to maximal simulated FF = 86.8% and VOC = 754 mV for a conversion efficiency η = 27.2%.

Abstract: In this work, lattice-matched 3-junction and 4-junction solar cells including the dilute nitride subcells were fabricated by a hybrid growth technique of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). It was found that photocarrier extraction in the MBE grown dilute nitride GaInNAsSb subcells degraded after the overgrowth of the upper subcells by MOCVD. Then, we focused on the effect of annealing for a set of MBE grown GaInNAsSb single junction solar cells annealed in the MOCVD reactor under an arsine flow ambient. It was found that degradation of the carrier extraction due to the MOCVD growth ambient is in a correlation with the selective hydrogen incorporation into the GaInNAsSb layers. We demonstrated that the subsequent annealing in nitrogen ambient promoted the outdiffusion of hydrogen which led to a recovery of the GaInNAsSb solar cell performances.

Abstract: Single layer coatings of hafnium carbide were deposited on stainless steel, copper and silicon substrates by means of reactive sputtering. The deposition process was optimized for maximum solar absorptance by varying the process parameters. In the case of coated stainless steel substrates, we obtained a maximum solar absorptance of 0.925 along with a thermal emittance of 0.13. For coated copper substrates we obtained a maximum solar absorptance of 0.948 along with a thermal emittance of 0.03. Reflectance spectra of SS and Cu substrates coated at optimized parameters were measured in the wavelength range 250 nm to 20 µm. Detailed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out to investigate the chemical composition of the coatings. XPS analysis of coated samples showed that because of the tendency of HfC to oxidize, the coating had a surface consisting mostly of HfO2 but the extent of oxidation reduced with depth and partially oxidized HfC was present on the subsurface layers of the coatings. Along with the absorbing nature of HfC and appropriate coating thickness, the high solar absorptance of the coating can be partially attributed to the presence of HfO2 near the surface which acts similar to an antireflection layer. Assuming a two-layer model of the coating, an upper HfO2 layer and a HfC layer underneath it, reflectance spectra of the coated samples were simulated using SCOUT software and compared to the experimentally obtained spectra. For all the samples, best fit values of coating thicknesses were in the range 120–130 nm.

Abstract: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has exhibited marginal improvement in survival rate, despite advances in surgical debulking and chemotherapy regimens. Although the majority of EOC patients achieve a clinical remission after induction therapy, over 80% relapse and succumb to chemoresistant disease. In this regard, it is of paramount importance to elucidate molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways which promote therapy resistance in EOC in order to devise novel and more effective treatment strategies. In this study, we showed that activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is significantly higher in therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to chemosensitive counterparts, which was positively associated with resistance to cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel and erlotinib. Bay 11-7082, a highly selective NF-κB inhibitor, reduced cell proliferation, clonogenicity and anoikis resistance in the therapy-resistant EOC cells and induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, Bay 11-7082 decreased the expression of pro-survival, inflammatory and metastatic genes and synergistically increased anti-proliferative efficacy of cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel and erlotinib. Altogether, these findings suggest that NF-κB is an attractive therapeutic target in EOC to be exploited in translational oncology and Bay 11-7082 is a potential anti-cancer drug to overcome chemoresistance and inhibit proliferation of the EOC cells.

Abstract: In this work, we found that the deposition of a Cu-deficient layer after alkali post-deposition treatment (PDT) of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) at low temperature (450 °C) effectively improves the performance of CIGS solar cells. Compared to the CGIS with only the alkali PDT, the deposition of the Cu-deficient layer leads to the formation of larger holes on the surface and results in higher efficiency. The conversion efficiency improved from 11% to 16% after alkali PDT and Cu-deficient layer deposition because of a passivation effect. The formation of a passivation layer after both alkali treatment and Cu-deficient layer deposition was observed by TEM-EDX, showing that the deposition of the Cu-deficient layer could contribute to a low Cu surface composition. Finally, the effect on the CIGS and CdS interface was analyzed using electron-beam-induced current measurement (EBIC).

Abstract: In this work, we employ atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form Al2O3 layer as an encapsulant for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Al2O3 layer deposited at temperature as low as 95 °C achieves water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 1.84 × 10−2 g m−2 d−1 at 45 °C–100%RH when thermal ALD is used. In order to test the moisture barrier capability of Al2O3 layer for PSCs, mesoporous perovskite devices, with spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA as hole transport layer (HTM) encapsulated by 50 nm Al2O3 film, are exposed to 65 °C–85%RH for 350 h and their stabilities are monitored. We find that the color of perovskite does not change after 350 h of exposure regardless of the type of HTM used. With regards to Th-ALD encapsulated devices, PTAA based PSCs experienced a smaller power conversion efficiency (PCE) drop than spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs after thermal stress at 65 °C. This is due to the presence of pinholes within spiro-OMeTAD layer after thermal stress which are not observed in PTAA. Finally, we successfully achieve excellent durability test results for mesoporous (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.85(CH3NH3PbBr3)0.15/PTAA devices encapsulated by 50 nm Al2O3 with less than 4% drop in PCE after 7500 h (> 10 months) of exposure to 50%RH under room temperature.

Abstract: The earth-abundant Cu based multinary chalcogenides have great interest in the field of environmentally benign thin film solar cells. Recently, Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS), one of the important Cu based chalcogenide has drawn prime attention in research and development due to their nontoxic and earth abundant constituent elements. The optical properties of CFTS make it a suitable candidate for thin film solar cells (TFSCs). This paper provides a review on the physical and chemical synthesis of CFTS nanoparticles and thin films and focuses the current status of CFTS based TFSCs. This article begins with a description of the crystal structure of CFTS, and then discussion on various solution and vacuum based techniques used to grow nanostructures and deposit compact thin films. Further, the review will summarize photovoltaic behavior of CFTS thin films. Finally, we discussed the challenges and scope and the perspectives for further developments in the existing research on CFTS based solar cells.

Abstract: Admittance measurements were performed on Sb2Se3-based thin-film solar cells with energy conversion efficiencies from 3.85% to 5.91%. Three defects located at different energy levels above the valence band maximum (VBM) in the ranges of 0.3–0.4, 0.2–0.6 and 0.5–0.6 eV were identified for all cells and denoted D1, D2 and D3, respectively; the exact energy level of each defect within these ranges varied between cells. Correlations between the defect properties and the cell efficiencies were investigated and it was found that the activation energies of both D1 and D2 increased with decreasing efficiencies, the capture lifetime of holes increased with increasing efficiencies for both D1 and D2, and no obvious relationship with efficiency was found for D3. This indicated that D1 and D2 may play more important roles that affect the efficiencies in the measured samples. DC reverse bias-dependent admittance measurements enabled identification of D1 and D2 as bulk-type defects while D3 was identified as an interface or near-interface type defect. Finally, large parasitic series resistance and inductance effect, instead of defects, were considered to dominate the admittance spectra in the high frequency range (> 105 Hz).

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells, mainly based on the prototypical CH3NH3PbI3, have recently emerged as a disruptive technology in the solar cell industry. Despite the great successes in the exceptional power conversion efficiency, many underlying mechanisms involving the structures and performance of the perovskite solar cells remain elusive, such as the role of the methylammonium cation and the optimization of the passivation technique. These hinder the formulation of a universal design principle that can guide us to rationally improve the perovskite solar cell performance. In addition, the notorious stability issue in perovskite solar cells prevents the solar cell from wide industrial application. In this manuscript, we closely examine the cation rotation and the passivating layer at the halide perovskite surface in the context of the stability issue. An experimentally-proved passivating agent iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) is used as an example. The ab initio investigation is performed via constraining/relaxing the cation rotation at the perovskite surface and manipulating the coverage of IPFB. Many existing reports tend to agree that the methylammonium cation rotation could be beneficial to the outstanding performance of the perovskite solar cell due to the ferroelectric effect. On the other hand, the passivating agents such as molecular additives tend to universally improve the device stability. In this study, our calculation suggests that: 1) the methylammonium cation rotation could undesirably accelerate the water infiltration process at the perovskite surface; 2) the passivating layer can counter-intuitively facilitate the water interaction with the perovskite surface; both of these could severely degrade the solar cell stability. Therefore, we emphasize on the double-edged sword effects of cation rotation and additive passivation on the stability of the perovskite solar cells. This study facilitates the convergence to the fundamental understanding of the organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells and is beneficial for the rational design of the halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: In this work, we have fabricated heterojunction solar cells between layers of p-type CuS and n-type Ag2S deposited through successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. We have introduced Sn2+ and Al3+ as heterovalent-dopants in the cationic sites of Ag2S and studied their effect on the photovoltaic performance of the heterojunctions. As evidenced from the band diagrams drawn from scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of the components, such doping shifted the Fermi energy of pristine Ag2S towards the conduction band-edge influencing the solar cell activities of the heterojunction in turn. While the trivalent Al-dopants introduced defects states in Ag2S and hence deteriorated the cell efficiency, doping with 5 at% of Sn at the silver site resulted in band-engineered pn-junction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 2.85%.

Abstract: It is important to improve the efficiency of solar cells textured by the MACE method, and the surface morphology has a significant effect on the efficiency. In this paper, we textured multicrystalline wafer using MACE method, and the surface morphology was further modified by post-etching process to achieve high efficiency. The influence of structure on diffusion and surface passivation was studied. It reveals that surface structure has a big effect on diffusion and passivation, thus affecting the efficiency. Structure with large aspect ratio results in heavily doped regions and poor passivation performance. Finally, large area solar cells with the efficiency of 19.08% and 19.11% were obtained on slurry wire and diamond wire saw multicrystalline wafer respectively, which is 0.5% and 0.8% absolutely higher than the cells with traditional acid texturing.

Abstract: Nurr1, a nuclear transcription factor, has been linked to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in heart and kidney via modulating mitochondrial homeostasis. However, its role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion has not been defined. In the present study, we found that cerebral IRI significantly increased the expression of Nurr1 and genetic ablation of Nurr1 attenuated the infarction area and reduced the neuron apoptosis under brain IRI burden. Functional studies have demonstrated that Nurr1 induced neuron death via activating mitochondrial fission. Aberrant mitochondrial fission promoted mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, evoked cellular oxidative stress and activated caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, Nurr1 deletion alleviated fission-mediated mitochondrial damage, sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis and favoring neuron survival. Further, we found that Nurr1 deletion modulated mitochondrial fission via preventing INF2 upregulation in a manner dependent on YAP pathways. Either pharmacological blockade of YAP pathway or overexpression of INF2 abrogated the inhibitory effect of Nurr1 deletion on mitochondrial fission, leading to neuron death via mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our results report that the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with Nurr1 upregulation followed by augmented mitochondrial fission via an abnormal YAP-INF2 pathways.

MicroRNA-17 inhibition overcomes chemoresistance and suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition through a DEDD-dependent mechanism in gastric cancer,

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of important gene-regulatory molecules, correlates with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemo resistance in gastric cancer (GC). Microarray analysis revealed that aberrant expressed microRNA-17 (miR-17) and DEDD were identified in GC. DEDD has been found to act as an endogenous suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. However, the role of miRNA-17 (miR-17) has not been clearly evaluated in GC, thereby a series of in vitro experiments were performed in this study. The levels of miR-17 and DEDD in GC tissues from patients diagnosed with GC and in five GC cell lines (SGC-7901, MKN-45, HGC-27, BGC823, and AGS) were detected. It was found that miR-17 up-regulated and DEDD down-regulated in GC, and SGC-7901 and AGS cells were adopted for the in vitro cell experiments, in which the expression of miR-17 or DEDD was regulated by transfection. DEDD was validated to be a target gene of miR-17. Inhibition of miR-17 impaired EMT in GC cells. In addition, transwell assay and scratch test results revealed that inhibition of miR-17 hindered GC cell invasion and migration. Moreover, inhibition of miR-17 reduced resistance to cisplatin- or 5-Fu in GC cells and induced cisplatin- or 5-Fu-treated GC cell apoptosis, which evaluated by using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays. From the short review above, the key findings emerge that inhibition of miR-17 may have tumor suppressive effects on GC and enhance its chemosensitivity by promoting DEDD, highlighting a novel target for GC therapy.

Abstract: A micro-prism array (MPA) integrated with subwavelength structures (SWSs) was employed to improve the efficiency of a CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) solar cell by minimizing optical reflection losses caused by the metal grids. The MPA mounted on the CIGS solar cell refracted incident light normal to the grid into the nearby surface of the solar cell, thereby minimizing the optical reflection losses caused by the metal grids. Furthermore, to reduce reflection losses at the surface of the MPA, SWSs were formed on the MPA glass. This resulted in increased photovoltaic current, which enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells. The final short circuit current density and the PCE of the CIGS solar cells with MPA glass integrated with SWSs were improved by 9.0% and 8.5%, respectively, compared with those of a CIGS solar cell without cover glass.

Abstract: The effects of the CdCl2 passivation treatment on thin-film CdTe photovoltaic films and devices have been extensively studied. Recently, with an addition of CdSeTe layer at the front of the absorber layer, device conversion efficiencies in excess of 19% have been demonstrated. The effects of the CdCl2 passivation treatment for devices using CdSeTe has not been studied previously. This is the first reported study of the effect of the treatment on the microstructure of the CdSeTe /CdTe absorber. The device efficiency is < 1% for the as-deposited device but this is dramatically increased by the CdCl2 treatment. Using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), we show that the CdCl2 passivation of CdSeTe/CdTe films results in the removal of high densities of stacking faults, increase in grain size and reorientation of grains. The CdCl2 treatment leads to grading of the absorber CdSeTe/CdTe films by diffusion of Se between the CdSeTe and CdTe regions. Chlorine decorates the CdSeTe and CdTe grain boundaries leading to their passivation. Direct evidence for these effects is presented using STEM and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) on device cross-sections prepared using focused ion beam etching. The grading of the Se in the device is quantified using EDX line scans. The comparison of CdSeTe/CdTe device microstructure and composition before and after the CdCl2 treatment provides insights into the important effects of the process and points the way to further improvements that can be made.

Abstract: A hole-transporting layer is essential for effective operation of planar perovskite solar cells. Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) used so far are mainly based on organic semiconductors, which are usually expensive and relatively instable compared with inorganic materials. In this article, crystalline selenium (c-Se) prepared by thermal evaporation followed by annealing at low temperature was used as the hole-transporting layer for the planar perovskite solar cells in the device structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/SnO2/perovskite/selenium/Au. The device employing c-Se as HTM displayed enhanced long-term stability, keeping 80% of the original efficiency after 40 days in ambient environment. However, the power conversion efficiency of 8.3% remains low compared with the device based on spiroOMeTAD, which results from higher recombination in the c-Se device as determined by impedance spectroscopy. Thermal-evaporated selenium could be a low-cost and easy-fabrication HTM for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells after reducing the recombination in devices.

Abstract: A key strategy for further reducing the cost of solar electricity is through the development and production of very-high efficiency silicon solar cells (> 25%). The challenge in achieving this goal lies in overcoming limitations imposed by the electronic quality of the silicon wafers themselves. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to understand the defects limiting the electronic quality of silicon wafers. In this review, we critically assess recent progress in understanding the recombination properties of defects in silicon and provide a nuanced and detailed picture of what constitutes accurate recombination parameters for such defects. Here we show that lifetime spectroscopy and capacitance spectroscopy analyses contain significant limitations, namely disregard of multivalent defect recombination in lifetime spectroscopy analyses, lack of exciton capture mechanisms in some deep level capacitance spectroscopy measurements and limitations in using detailed balance to extract capture parameters in capacitance spectroscopy. We demonstrate that combining multiple analyses leads to a more robust determination of recombination parameters. We use such combined analyses to review recombination pathways and parameters for technology relevant defects with the goal of enabling robust simulation of the lifetime in silicon for solar cell applications.

Abstract: The highly sialoglycosylated extracellular domain of podocalyxin (Podxl) is a constituent of the endothelial glycocalyx of most blood vessels but it is unknown if Podxl plays a prominent role in the function of the glycocalyx as a regulator of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. We have recently found that mice lacking Podxl in the vascular endothelium develop histological lesions compatible with severe vasculitis resulting in organ failure and premature death. In this work, we show that these mice have an increased quantity of resident leukocytes within the peritoneal cavity in both basal and inflammatory conditions. Adhesion of macrophagic cells to lung endothelial cells from Podxl-deficient mice was increased under inflammatory stimuli. Both, chemokine binding and chemokine-mediated adhesion of immune cells were significantly higher in Podxl-deficient endothelial cells. Moreover, glycocalyx function assessed by measuring the anticoagulant capacity of endothelial cell monolayers to inactivate thrombin was significantly altered in the absence of Podxl. Overall, the results suggest that Podxl is an essential component of the glycocalyx and has an important so far unknown role in preventing leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion under resting and inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Phase change material is one of the most promising materials in thermal energy storage systems. In this work, a new phase change composite of Stearic Acid@Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SA@MWCNTs) is prepared by a simple vacuum absorption method. The as-prepared composite is determined by scanning electronic microscope (SEM), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The results show that outside diameters of the PCM composite are about 50–60 nm and Stearic Acid is encapsulated in the MWCNTs without chemical reaction. The DSC results indicate that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite are 59.28 °C and 91.94 J g−1, respectively. The encapsulation ratio of Stearic Acid is calculated to be 47% from the results of the DSC measurements. The as-prepared SA@MWCNTs composite was dispersed into the water to form stable suspension, and the suspension shows remarkable photo-thermal conversion performance with temperature increases from 30 to 80 °C. The receiver efficiency of this new kind of heat transfer fluid maintain 85% in wide temperature range. Furthermore, the PCM composite could maintain its phase transition perfectly after 50 melting–freezing cycles, and no leakage of paraffin was observed by SEM. The high heat storage capability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performance of the composite enable it to be a potential material to store solar energy in practical applications.

Abstract: We report a facile one-pot synthesis of the multi-shaped anisotropic plasmonic Ag nanostructures (Mx-AgNPs) and demonstrated for the broadband plasmonic enhancement in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The UV–Vis spectra obtained during the synthesis of AgNPs revealed the fine-tuning of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak and the occurrence of broadband multiple SPR peak with an increase in reaction time. The TEM images confirm the collective presence of different shapes/sizes of the Ag nanoparticles (including sphere, oval, polygon, triangular, rod and some irregular morphologies). The resultant ultra-broadband LSPR from the Mx-AgNPs were utilized to improve the total light absorption coefficient of N719 dye. We observed that the photoanode film incorporated with of Mx-AgNPs enhances light harvesting of the dye up to 60% over an entire visible region. The effects of Mx-AgNPs in the photoanode film on the efficiency and the spectral response of the DSSCs were further evaluated experimentally. Substantial improvement with the considerable broadening in the spectral response was observed in the ‘incident photon- to current conversion efficiency’ (IPCE) spectra for the plasmonic DSSCs. The ‘power conversion efficiency’ (PCE) for the best performing plasmonic DSSCs found to improve by ~ 30% for the plasmonic DSSCs. The observed improvement in the efficiency was mainly attributed to the significant enhancement of the light harvesting capacity of the DSSCs resulted by ultra-broadband surface plasmon resonance of the Mx-AgNPs.

Abstract: Interfacial properties play a critical role in the dynamic process of carrier transport in dopant-free silicon (Si) heterojunction solar cells (HSCs), based on the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). In this study, we use quinhydrone (QHY) to engineer the interfacial properties by grafting the semiquinone (QH) on Si surface at low temperature. The QH monolayer provides effective chemical and field-effect passivation by the surface dangling-bond saturation and its interface dipole, respectively, and results in a large minority carrier lifetime of 477 μs. At the front Si/PEDOT:PSS interface, the QH-terminated Si surface presents higher wettability for the improved contact at the Si/PEDOT:PSS junction. At the rear Al/Si interface, the work function of Al film is reduced significantly to form ohmic contact for electron-selective transport. The dark current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements show the improved electric characteristics with a higher carrier collection efficiency. Furthermore, the silicon band bending generated by the QH dipoles enhances the overall built-in potential of Si/PEDOT:PSS HSCs for a larger open-circuit voltage. As a result, the QHY modified Si/PEDOT:PSS HSC yields a power conversion efficiency of 13.29%. This approach demonstrates that the organic grafting is a simple, effective and low-cost method for the interface engineering to achieve high-efficiency HSCs.

Abstract: By simultaneously reflecting solar irradiation and emitting thermal radiation to the cold universe through an atmospheric window lying within 8–13 µm of the electromagnetic spectrum, surfaces could be cooled below ambient temperature under direct sunlight. However, both humidity and cloud coverage can raise the sky emissivity, significantly intensifying thermal emission within the 8–13 µm spectrum. A radiative cooler is strongly absorptive of the additional heat load, and eventually, the cooling capacity drops in a humid environment. In this work, we suggest integrating the cooler with an asymmetric electromagnetic transmission (AEMT) window, which permits outgoing radiative transmission, but reflects incoming radiation of the same wavelengths, so as to recover the cooling performance under a humid climate. This study aims at discussing the working principle of an AEMT enhanced radiative cooler quantitatively as well as demonstrating a feasible design of an AEMT device for radiative cooling applications. First, a theoretical model on the basis of conservation of energy is developed for the prediction of cooling performance of the AEMT enhanced radiative cooling systems. Cooling power is solved for a humid semi-transparent sky condition numerically, which shows that an AEMT window with forward and backward transmittances of 0.8 and 0.4 respectively could restore the cooling power of the passive radiative cooler by 57%. Second, validated finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations reveal that an AEMT window implemented by near-wavelength tapered metallic gratings could meet the desired transmission ratio (i.e. contrast ratio of 2 within 8–13 µm spectrum) for radiative cooling.

Abstract: Planar perovskite solar cells and modules were realized by using low temperature solution-process fabrication procedures. The photovoltaic performance was improved by optimizing a SnO2 electron transport layer and its interface with the perovskite layer. We achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3% on small area cell (0.09 cm2) with negligible hysteresis and a steady-state PCE equal to 17.4%. Furthermore, shelf life tests showed a relative decrease of only 5% in PCE from its initial value after 1000 h of storage in dark conditions in air (RH 20%). Up-scaling of the technology was implemented entirely in air with fabrication of modules with a high aperture ratio of 91%. The modules delivered a maximum PCE of 13.1% obtained on an active area of 13.8 cm2 and of 11.9% on an aperture area of 15.2 cm2 representing state of art performance for fully low temperature solution processed planar perovskite solar modules.

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to investigate the effects of topotecan (TPT) on the hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in a rat model, and to explore the underlying mechanism.
Methods
The experiments were carried out in vitro using rat PASMCs and in vivo using a rat model of hypoxia-induced PAH.
Results
TPT significantly suppressed the hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1α and TRPC1/4/6 expression both in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from normal rats and in pulmonary arteries from PAH model rats. Furthermore, TPT effectively inhibited intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) change (Ca2+ influx) in PASMCs from both normal rats and PAH model rats. Importantly, TPT treatment significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced proliferation, migration and a contractile-to-synthetic phenotypic switching of normal rat PASMCs in vitro, where the effect was abrogated by overexpression of TRPC1/4/6. Furthermore, TPT administration potently attenuated the hypoxia-induced PAH-associated pulmonary arteriolar remodeling in PAH model rats, as evidenced by amelioration of elevated hemodynamic parameters, and enhanced right ventricle hypertrophy and wall thickening.
Conclusion
TPT ameliorates the hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH, and the mechanism is associated with TPT-mediated inhibition of hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1α and TRPC1/4/6 expression, Ca2+ influx, and PASMCs proliferation.

Abstract: Helicobacter pylori is the strongest known risk-factor for gastric cancer. However, its role in gastric cancer metastasis remains unclear. Previously we have reported that H. pylori promotes gastric cancer invasiveness by stabilizing the E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2 which is mediated by Siah2 acetylation at Lys 139 (K139) residue. Here we identify that cell adhesion-related proteins testin (TES) and filamin-C (FLN-C) interact with Siah2 and get proteasomally degraded. The efficiency of TES and FLN-C degradation is significantly potentiated by K139-acetylated Siah2 (ac-K139 Siah2) in infected gastric cancer cells (GCCs). ac-Siah2-mediated downregulation of TES and FLN-C disrupts filopodia structures but promotes lamellipodia formation and enhances invasiveness and migration of infected GCCs. Since H. felis-infected mice as well as human gastric cancer biopsy samples also show high level of ac-K139 Siah2 and downregulated TES and FLN-C, we believe that acetylation of Siah2 is an important checkpoint that can be useful for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to determine the photovoltaic properties of inverted organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) that employ indium–tin oxide (ITO) modified by ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) as an electron-collecting electrode under indoor lighting conditions. Owing to the reduced current generation at low light intensity, possessing a sufficiently large shunt resistance (RP) associated with a low leakage current is of utmost importance for performance maximization. The photovoltaic properties under this lighting condition were optimized by controlling the thickness of the PEIE layers, and the electrical, optical, and surface properties of the PEIE-modified ITO were determined. Inverted OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)–indene-C60 bisadduct (P3HT–ICBA) with an 8.5-nm-thick PEIE layer yielded a maximum power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9% under an LED light with a luminance of 500 lx. Meanwhile, the same device showed poor performance with a PCE of 3.1% under 1 sun illumination owing to the insulating nature of PEIE.

Abstract: Upcoming generation of smart windows requires simple design, fast stimulus response and cost-effective production. Aiming these features, we reported a new approach of switchable devices based on the thermosensitive polymer poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) and facile assembly of the components (FTO layers and polymer). Its optical/color change from transparent to opaque is temperature-dependent and activated by induced Joule heating of conductive substrates. Therefore, the reported devices showed fast reversible response (less than 60 s) by small input power and adjustable opaqueness according to polymer concentration. In opposite to traditional electrochromic smart windows dependence of the kinetics charge-transfer reaction, the observed features are triggered by the thermodynamic mechanism of the reversible coil-globule transition from PNVCL suspension, which can lead to stable performance of the proposed device.

Abstract: We study a boron tribromide (BBr3) diffusion process with second deposition realized by active nitrogen flow through the BBr3 bubbler at the end of the process with respect to laser doping. Compared to the reference BBr3 diffusion without second deposition, the new BBr3 diffusion provides a two times higher boron dose within the borosilicate glass (BSG)/silicon dioxide (SiO2) stack layer grown on the silicon surface. The second deposition leads to both thinning of the intermediate SiO2 layer and 11 nm-growth of the BSG layer, which results in an 8 nm thicker BSG/SiO2 stack layer with a total thickness of 42 nm. These altered properties of the BSG/SiO2 layer facilitate the formation of laser-doped selective boron emitters, while the second deposition hardly affects the as diffused charge carrier concentration profile. The obtained emitter properties, sheet resistance Rsh ≈ 100 Ω/sq and emitter dark saturation current density j0e ≈ 25 fA/cm2 (textured surface, Al2O3/SiNX passivation) for the photoactive part of the emitter are not affected by the introduced second deposition step. For the laser-doped part of the emitter, the charge carrier concentration after laser doping is higher for the BBr3 diffusion with second deposition resulting in stronger local doping with up to 10 Ω/sq lower Rsh. The application of an analytical model to calculate specific contact resistances ρC in dependence of e.g. dopant concentration of the laser-doped profiles and crystallite penetration depth dcryst reveals that ρC is expected to benefit largely from the altered profile shapes due to laser doping for the BBr3 diffusion with second deposition. A relative decrease in ρC of up to 90% and 50% is found for small dcryst (depth of several tens of nm) and large dcryst (depth of several hundreds of nm), respectively. Another potential advantage of the second deposition holds for emitter dark saturation current densities at the metal-silicon interface j0,met. A 3D simulation model that is based on metal crystallites penetrating into the emitter considering the different doping profiles after laser processing yields a j0,met ≈ 740 fA/cm2 for small dcryst that is 14% relatively lower for the BBr3 diffusion with second deposition.

Abstract: In this work, we present the application of poly-Si carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPCs) as both polarities in interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) solar cell architectures. We compared two approaches to form a gap between the back-surface field (BSF) and emitter fingers. It is proved that the gaps prepared by both approaches are efficient in preventing carriers’ recombination. To minimize the reflection losses, we developed a novel modulated surface texturing (MST) structure as anti-reflection coating (ARC). It is obtained by superposing a nano-textured SiO2 layer on the conventional micro-textured pyramids, which are passivated with a-Si:H / SiNx:H layers. This approach decouples the light harvesting from the Si surface passivation, which potentially results in the highest possible optical and electrical performances of the solar cells. The reflectance (R) of the MST-ARC is very close to that of the high-aspect ratio nano-structured silicon (black-Silicon), achieving R < 1% between 450 and 1000 nm. The J0 of MST-ARC passivated Si surface (6.3 fA/cm2) is the same as that of standard a-Si:H/SiNx:H layers passivated pyramidally-textured Si surface. By applying this novel MST-ARC in our IBC solar cell, the highest JSC observed in a device is 42.2 mA/cm2 with a VOC as high as 701 mV. A spectral response enhancement in case of the MST-ARC cell is observed over the whole wavelength range with respect to the cell with standard SiNx:H ARC. The highest efficiency achieved in this work is 23.0%, with the potential to reach 24.0% in short term by using more conductive metal fingers.

Abstract: Near Infra Red (NIR) energy harvesting is one of the advanced strategies to improve the overall performance of new generation solar photovoltaics. We introduce here a new heterogeneously coupled Stranski–Krastanov (SK) on Submonolayer (SML) quantum dot (QD) heterostructure, which is capable of enhanced energy conversion efficiency in that typical spectral range. The coupling in the proposed structure has been optimized by varying the growth rate and the barrier thickness between seed SML and top SK QDs. The optimal configuration has been incorporated into a quantum dot solar cell (QDSC). The carrier transitions in this hybrid QD assembly have been investigated through luminescence spectroscopy. An existence of carrier tunnelling between SML and SK QDs has been revealed from the photoluminescence and the photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. The unique configuration of such coupled QDs shows the presence of resonating energy states. These phenomena ameliorate the absorption efficiency in the NIR regime with increased photoexcited carrier lifetime, which has been reflected in the external quantum efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years it has been shown that graphene oxide (GO) can be used to passivate silicon surfaces resulting in increased photocurrents in metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunneling diodes, and in improved efficiencies in Schottky-barrier solar cells with either metal or graphene barriers, however, the source of this passivation is still unclear. The suggested mechanisms responsible for the enhanced device performance include the dangling bond saturation at the surface by the diverse functional groups decorating the GO sheets which reduce the recombination sites, or field effect passivation produced by intrinsic negative surface charge of GO. In this work through a series of measurements of minority carrier lifetime with the microwave photo-conductance decay (µPCD) technique, infrared absorption spectra, and surface potential with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) we show that there is no evidence of significant chemical passivation coming from the GO films but rather negative field effect passivation. We also discuss the stability of GO's passivation and the flexibility of this material for its application as temporary passivation layer for bulk lifetime measurements, or as a potential cheap alternative to current passivation materials used in solar cell fabrication.

Abstract: Currently, the research in absorber films for solar cells is focused on the development of non-toxic, low-cost, and high-available materials. Thus, the CuSbS2 phase of the Cu-Sb-S system is promising due to its attractive optoelectronic properties. Chalcostibite thin films have been deposited by several approaches, however, their synthesis, as a predominant phase, is still challenging. In this work, CuSbS2 films were prepared by a simple immersion of amorphous Sb2S3 into a Cu solution. The effect of the annealing on their microstructure was assessed, too. From energy dispersive, X-ray photoelectron, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission, and Raman spectroscopies results, the formation of CuSbS2 was verified to occur through simultaneous dissolution and cationic exchange reactions. The microstructural evolution of the films goes from amorphous, passing by a chalcostibite phase, which enhances its crystallinity with further temperature increment, and finally, it undergoes a phase transition to tetrahedrite. These transitions have a strong impact on the charge carrier concentration, which generates important changes in their optoelectronic performance. The simplicity together with the demonstrated strong impact of the annealing make this methodology versatile and a powerful tool to prepare high-quality Cu-Sb-S films, as interesting candidates as absorber layers in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: The durability of two solar-selective aluminium titanium oxynitride multilayer coatings was studied under conditions simulating realistic operation of central receiver power plants. The coatings were deposited by cathodic vacuum arc applying an optimized design concept for complete solar-selective coating (SSC) stacks. Compositional, structural and optical characterization of initial and final stacks was performed by scanning electron microscopy, elastic recoil detection, UV–Vis–NIR-IR spectrophotometry and X-Ray diffraction. The design concept of the solar selective coatings was validated by an excellent agreement between simulated and initial experimental stacking order, composition and optical properties. Both SSC stacks were stable in single stage tests of 12 h at 650 °C. At 800 °C, they underwent a structural transformation by full oxidation and they lost their solar selectivity. During cyclic durability tests, multilayer 1, comprised of TiN, Al.64Ti.36N and an Al1.37Ti.54O top layer, fulfilled the performance criterion (PC) ≤ 5% for 300 symmetric, 3 h long cycles at 600 °C in air. Multilayer 2, which was constituted of four AlyTi1-y(OxN1-x) layers, met the performance criterion for 250 cycles (750 h), but was more sensitive to these harsh conditions. With regard to the degradation mechanisms, the coarser microstructure of multilayer 1 is more resistant against oxidation than multilayer 2 with its graded oxygen content. These results confirm that the designed SSCs based on AlyTi1-y(OxN1-x) materials withstand breakdown at 600 °C in air. Therefore, they can be an exciting candidate material for concentrated solar power applications at high temperature.

Abstract: Realization of fast hole extraction is an effective route for the performance enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The precise bandgap tuning in perovskite layer has been expected to accelerate hole extraction. Therefore, in this report, we demonstrate a modified one-step fabrication method for the bandgap tuning of perovskite layer by designing iodide concentration gradient. Prior to the perovskite precursor solution spin-coated, different concentration of methanaminium iodide (MAI) solution was pre-coated on PEDOT:PSS layer to form iodide concentration gradient in perovskite layer. Fast hole extraction and short lifetime due to iodide concentration gradient was confirmed by photoluminescence measurement. By optimizing the MAI concentration with 4 mg/ml, the modified PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 16.67% due to an increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 19.66 mA/cm2 to 23.52 mA/cm2 and an increase in open circuit voltage from 0.97 V to 1.01 V. These values are significantly higher than PSCs using conventional one-step fabrication method without pre-coated MAI layer, which exhibit efficiency of only 14.8%. We think that this new approach is an effective way to enhance the performance of PSCs.

Abstract: Critical avenues to increase energy yield for CdTe photovoltaic (PV) technology, such as bifacial cells or tandem cells designs, rely on the need to develop transparent back contact approaches that enable high efficiency and high transparency. We report the properties of earth-abundant p-type transparent conducting nanocomposite (NC) thin film (CuS)x(ZnS)1-x, deposited by low-cost chemical bath deposition method. Nanocomposite films of ~ 45 nm thickness transmit > 70% of the visible light and show compact grains of size ~ 10 nm. We investigate the photovoltaic performance of both opaque and semi-transparent CdTe solar cells using (CuS)x(ZnS)1-x NC thin films as a back contact interface layer. Introduction of the NC layer between the CdTe and a standard Cu/Au metallization process yielded the best device efficiency of 13%, representing a 3.2% relative improvement over the standard Cu/Au back contact. Semi-transparent CdTe devices finished with an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer allowed for comparison of front and back illumination schemes. Experimental and modeling results confirm that the bifacial device configuration leads to significant recombination losses under back illumination due to the absence of a charge separating field, a relatively high interface recombination rate, and an insufficient electron diffusion length. Once optimized, and with an improved interface and bulk CdTe carrier lifetimes, this NC earth-abundant transparent conductor based on Cu, Zn, and S may serve as an effective, inexpensive, low-toxicity back contact layer for a bifacial CdTe solar cell.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common invasive cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in male worldwide, reflecting the needs of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PCa. Emerging evidence has revealed small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) playing a significant role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, there are few reports about snoRNAs in PCa. Here, we found SNORA42 rather than its host gene (KIAA0907) was up-regulated in PCa cell lines. Meanwhile, an obvious up-regulation of SNORA42 was observed in cancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal tissues. SNORA42 could be induced by DHT stimulation. Over-expression of SNORA42 increased prostate cancer cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Importantly, SNORA42 increased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Higher SNORA42 expression level was found to be correlated with shorter survival in metastatic PCa tissues by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, but this effect was not found in primary PCa tissues. In conclusion, over-expression of SNORA42 could have an oncogenic effect on the progression of PCa. SNORA42 might serve as a prognostic biomarker in PCa.

Abstract: A stacked layer of ultrathin hydrogenated silicon oxide (SiOx:H) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has been developed to passivate the crystalline silicon (c-Si) surface (see graphical abstract). Silicon oxide has the advantage of excellent optical and passivation properties. The SiOx:H layer is deposited on the c-Si surface by atomic layer deposition (ALD), with its thickness precisely controlled below 2 nm. The a-Si:H layer is deposited on the SiOx:H layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with a specific doping property, i.e. intrinsic, n- or p-type. The samples are then annealed in the range of 100 °C to 950 °C to study the fundamental passivation properties. We find that a combination of an ultrathin SiOx:H and (p) a-Si:H layers shows a favorable passivation compared to a neat (p) a-Si:H layer. The effective minority carrier lifetime, measured by quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSSPC), is ~ 0.5 ms after low temperature annealing at 300 °C. The passivation property is discussed in terms of hydrogen concentration, bond configurations, stoichiometry x of SiOx:H, and material microstructure, characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. It is suggested that a reorganization of both the SiOx:H, and the (p) a-Si:H layers, associated with hydrogen diffusion, plays an important role in improving the passivation.

Abstract: A new report has shown that nicotine exposure can decrease serum testosterone by apoptosis in Leydig cells; however, in our previous studies, we have almost never observed apoptosis there. The purpose of this study is to ensure whether apoptosis or autophagy in Leydig cells occurred. Our results confirmed again that the concentration of testosterone in the sera of nicotine-treated mice statistically decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the data of single cell transcriptome indicated that the expression of autophagy-related genes was increased after nicotine exposure. Likewise, chemical and immune-histological staining demonstrated that autophagy of the Leydig cells increased after nicotine treatment rather than apoptosis. Apoptosis mainly exists in spermatids. Further, the expression of autophagy-related genes, such as Beclin1 and LC3, were up-regulated after nicotine exposure (P < 0.05). Additionally, the data of transmission electron microscopy showed more autophagosomes in the Leydig cells of the nicotine-exposed groups than the cells of the control groups. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of LC3 in the TM3 Leydig cell line indicated that rapamycin and nicotine exposure up-regulates the autophagy phenotype/process and down-regulates their testosterone synthesis. In addition, the methylation level of the promoter region of TCL1 is increased in the nicotine-treated group compared to the control group, consequently decreasing the expression of TCL1. In conclusion, the autophagy in Leydig cells induced by nicotine, which is set by the hyper-methylation of the TCL1 promoter region via the TCL1-mTOR-autophagy signaling pathway.

Abstract: As silicon photovoltaic technology advances, charge carrier losses at the contacted interfaces of the silicon absorber are coming to dominate power conversion efficiency. The so-called passivated contact, which provides selective charge-carrier extraction while simultaneously reducing interface recombination, is thus of significant interest for next-generation silicon solar cells. However, achieving both low recombination and low resistance to charge carrier extraction has proven challenging. Here, we present a passivated contact technology based on polysilicon deposited using low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) over an ultra-thin silicon dioxide layer, which achieves an excellent surface passivation with implied open-circuit voltage of 735 mV, a recombination prefactor below 1 fA cm−2 and contact resistivity below 1 mΩ cm2. Key to this technology is the deposition of an ultra-thin silicon dioxide interlayer under high temperature and low pressure condition, performed in-situ within a single process with the polysilicon deposition. Additionally, the passivating contact structure maintains its electronic properties at temperatures of up to 900 °C and is compatible with existing industrial processes. The presented work therefore represents a significant advancement in industrially-applicable passivated contact technology.

Abstract: Solar mirrors for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are expected to last at least 30 years. As this delay is far too long to obtain useful information regarding in-service degradation, accelerated approaches to weathering testing are performed by manufacturers and research laboratories in order to quickly assess the lifetime of commercial or new technologies. However, most published studies that have been performed in the CSP field are based on phenomenological approaches. The characterization of the degradation, which mostly considers reflectance loss, has rarely been linked to physical or chemical processes that are responsible for the degradation of properties. Furthermore, the general laws that can be established from these data to establish material behaviour are empirical. Ageing tests have been used for many years in other fields, particularly in the domain of polymeric materials. The impacts on the material properties of stress factors such as temperature, irradiation and humidity have been extensively studied, and models have been proposed for different kinds of materials, even though most are based on empirical observations. One of the goals of this article is to determine how these models could be applied to the weathering of solar mirrors, and as such, the goal of this paper is to provide a critical review of the various models that are most used and accepted by the scientific community. All of these models include material-dependent parameters, and the values that have been determined in these studies are reported here to list their order of magnitude.

Abstract: Lock-in thermography (LIT) is the standard method for imaging and evaluating leakage currents in solar cells. For usually applied lock-in frequencies in the order of 10 Hz, silicon solar cells are considered to be thermally thin. Hence, depth-dependent investigations, as they are performed in non-destructive testing and failure analysis of ICs, were not performed until now by LIT. In this contribution two special LIT investigation and evaluation methods are introduced, which have the potential to judge whether some recombination occurs at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom of a Si solar cell. Such investigations can be useful to evaluate e.g. metal-induced recombination or the influence of crystal defects in multicrystalline solar material on the emitter or backside recombination. The methods are tested at a cell containing a diamond scratch in the emitter and backside recombination at the Ag back contact.

Abstract: Corrosion of 316 SS in HITEC molten salt was investigated at 450 °C, 600 °C, and 680 °C by electrochemical methods including potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Corrosion products were investigated by XRD and SEM equipped with EDS. Corrosion of 316 SS in HITEC molten salt exhibited active corrosion characteristics at these temperatures. 316 SS exhibited resistance to corrosion in HITEC molten salt at 450 °C, suffered severe corrosion at 680 °C, and demonstrated discontinuously increasing corrosion rate from 600 °C to 680 °C. A thin layer of Cr2O3 and Fe-based oxides formed at 450 °C. At 600 °C and 680 °C three distinct oxide layers could be distinguished with a loose outer Fe-based oxide layer. After corrosion at 600 °C and 680 °C for 200 h, Na2O and K2O were detected in the HITEC molten salts, which caused the decomposition of the protective Cr2O3 layer and enhanced corrosion of 316 SS. EIS results show that the corrosion processes of 316 SS in molten salt at 450 °C and 600 °C are controlled by outward diffusion of metal ions and oxygen vacancies, while corrosion mechanism at 680 °C change to was inward diffusion of oxygen ions. The change in corrosion mechanism became more prominent when corrosion time was prolonged to 197 h.

Abstract: Two emerging trends in multicrystalline silicon cell texturing are plasma texturing, and metal catalyzed chemical etching. Both processes roughen silicon surfaces in order to increase light absorption. These processes are attractive as they are applicable to diamond-wire sawn wafers. This work investigates the optical properties of these surfaces, and other conventionally textured surfaces like isotropic acidic and random pyramid textures, are investigated for cells in air and after encapsulation for a large range of angles of incidence. We find that the angular optical performance in air varies strongly with cell texture, but when embedded in a module structure these variations are significantly mitigated: the advantages of a high angular absorption of solar cells are not fully transferred to the module level. This is especially notable for plasma etched, black silicon cell structures which suffer comparatively from poorer index matching and light recycling inside a module structure. The losses caused explicitly by the module embedding (described in the cell to module ratio) are in the range of 1–5% for perpendicular incoming light, and increase to 6–15% at an angle of incidence of 70°. Based on these angular performances, we calculate the annual yield of the modules and find that it varies by less than 2% for the cell textures. Nevertheless, the annual optical yield for the black silicon cell structures are the highest, whereas the metal catalyzed chemical etching cell structures show the lowest performance. Further, we find that different annual distributions of the incoming light at the two investigated locations (Melbourne and Alice Springs) only impact the relative performance of the cell textures at high module tilt angles.

Abstract: Electron–hole recombination at the Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS interface is believed to play a major role in limiting the efficiency of Cu2ZnSnS4 solar cells. In this work, we experimentally determine detailed Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS interface band diagrams as a function of process conditions, and correlate them to chemical processes occurring during interface formation and subsequent post-annealing. The newly devised experimental method involves a combination of photoemission spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Our measurements reveal that, under most process conditions, the band gaps of both Cu2ZnSnS4 and CdS decrease by several hundred meV near the interface. Furthermore, interface band bending and conduction band offsets are highly process-dependent and roughly correlated to the amount of chemical interdiffusion. The interface electronic properties are found to be unfavorable under all process conditions studied in this work, either due to a cliff-like conduction band offset, or to substantial band gap narrowing in Cu2ZnSnS4, or to both effects. According to the present study, the least harmful process conditions for the interface electronic properties are a low CdS deposition temperature without post-annealing. Even in such a case, a minimum open circuit voltage loss of 230 mV is expected due to interface- or near-interface recombination.

Abstract: Sodium fluorescein (‘fluorescein’) staining of the ocular surface is frequently an indicator of compromised ocular health, and increases in the presence of certain contact lens multi-purpose solutions (MPS), a phenomenon known as solution induced corneal staining (SICS). The mechanism(s) underpinning fluorescein hyperfluorescence are uncertain, though may reflect increased cellular uptake of fluorescein by corneal epithelial cells. We have developed an in vitro model to study fluorescein uptake in both ‘generic’ mammalian cells (murine fibroblasts) and human corneal cells. Fluorescein hyperfluorescence increased after treatment with two MPS associated with clinical corneal fluorescein staining, yet there was no cellular hyperfluorescence for two MPS that do not cause this staining. Increased fluorescein uptake did not correlate with presence of a necrotic or an apoptotic marker (propidium iodide and caspase-3 respectively). Incubation of MPS-treated cells with dynasore (an inhibitor of dynamin, implicated in endocytic pathways) reduced fluorescein uptake irrespective of MPS treatment. The non-ionic surfactant Tetronic 1107 (present in both MPS associated with corneal fluorescein staining) increased uptake of fluorescein for both cell types, whereas an unrelated surfactant (Triton X-100) did not. We conclude that the clinical hyperfluorescence profile observed after exposure to four MPS can be reproduced using a simple model of cellular fluorescein uptake, suggesting this is the biological basis for SICS. Fluorescein entry does not correlate with necrosis or apoptosis, but instead involves a dynamin-dependent active process. Moreover the surfactant Tetronic 1107 appears to be a key MPS constituent triggering increased fluorescein entry, and may be the major factor responsible for SICS.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide is one of the likeliest candidates for future smart window applications due to its self-regulating nature and potentially simple implementation. However, the material is plagued with multiple drawbacks which need to be addressed before its commercialization. Amongst these, its low luminous transmittance has been the subject of many studies. In the present work, we propose to integrate a VO2 film into a traditional silver-containing low emissivity coating architecture. We first model and discuss the theoretical performance of such a coating in comparison with more standard configurations and demonstrate that the addition of silver offers many advantages for thin VO2 coatings; mainly an increase of luminous transmittance due to the presence of antireflective coatings while maintaining a high solar transmittance variation vs. temperature. The latter is shown to be the result of a displacement of the maximum transmission variation to lower wavelengths where the solar intensity is higher. We then fabricate prototype samples which confirm the predicted performance. Indeed, a silver-containing sample based on the following architecture Si3N4 [57 nm] | VO2 [27 nm] | Ag [11 nm] | Si3N4 [66 nm] is shown to possess the unique combination of a high luminous transmittance of 58.2% in its low temperature state, a solar transmittance variation of 7.1% with the added benefit of a low emissivity of 10%.

A novel fused silica liquid light guide lens with unique water cooling approach was used to efficiently couple the concentrated solar radiations from the focal zone of a parabolic mirror into the laser rod within a conical pumping cavity. 32.5 W continuous-wave 1064 nm solar laser power was measured, corresponding to 6.7% slope efficiency, being 1.28 times more than the previous record. The highest solar laser collection efficiency of 32.5 W/m2 was also achieved.

Abstract: Although CdS has been proven to be one of the best photocatalysts in visible light region, its photocorrosion characteristics and toxicity prohibit its practical applications in photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photodegradation of organic pollutants in waste water. In addition, the photocatalytic efficiency of single phase CdS nanostructure is still low due to the recombination of photo-induced carriers. In this paper, a facile modification of CdS nanobelts approach is proposed by assembling TiO2 nanowire on the surface of CdS nanobelts to form TiO2 nanowire/CdS nanobelt hybrid nanstructures. This approach can kill two birds with one stone, that is, to eliminate the photocorrosion induced nontoxicity, and enhance photocatalytic properties by inducing UV light active TiO2 nanowires, and enhance the photo-induced carrier separation ability. The cell cyto-compatibility experiments on TiO2 nanowire/CdS nanobelt hybrid photocatalyst proved that the toxicity of CdS nanobelts can be totally eliminated. At the same time, photodegradation performance of for CdS/TiO2 is over 3 times of that for CdS nanobelts and10 times of that for TiO2. This work gives a new insight in the field of photocatalytic water treatment.

Abstract: For the first time, the application of large-area 2D colloidal photonic crystals for light trapping in flexible OPV modules is demonstrated via the study of a broad range of light trapping structures deposited simply and cheaply using our novel roll-to-roll Langmuir–Blodgett technique. Commercially available flexible OPV modules with a size of 10 cm × 14 cm were used. Colloidal silica spheres with diameters ranging from 50 nm to 740 nm were used for the photonic crystal fabrication. The photonic structures made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 50 nm and 120 nm demonstrate good antireflective properties in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, which have a pronounced positive effect on the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency in OPV modules at all angles of the light incidence. The 2D photonic crystals made from SiO2 spheres with diameters of 600 nm and 740 nm show strong diffractive scattering of incident light in the forward direction, which results in significant light trapping effects in the OPV modules which again gives rise to an improvement in the cell characteristics. The observed light trapping effects vary only slightly with angle of incidence, suggesting that such photonic crystal layers could be of direct benefit in terms of the response of the OPV modules without the need to track the sun position as it moves across the sky.

Abstract: Inspired by the morphologies and function of the root and the stalk of a turnip, which has evolved with the unique pattern of growth for enhancing transport phenomenon, a novel architecture of BiVO4/CuSCN architecture is fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass by initially fabricating bulky BiVO4 film (the root) and subsequently depositing p-type CuSCN nanorods (the stalk). With the creation of BiVO4/CuSCN nanorod heterojunction photoanodes, the photocurrent density increases to 1.78 mA cm−2 compared to 1.22 mA cm−2 of bare BiVO4 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. More importantly, the onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction exhibits a dramatic cathodic shift (~ 230 mV). The heterojunction also possesses internal quantum efficiency of approximately 50% in the range from 350 to 450 nm with relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency (0.5%) and much higher oxidation efficiency (~ 90%). The unique electrode architecture design favoring the simple water splitting process over conventionally fabricated electrode by providing more active sites and facilitates transportation and consumption of photoinduced holes could open up a new route for the high-efficiency photoanodes.

Abstract: The electrical parameters and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3 MeV and 8 MeV proton beam irradiated upright metamorphic (UMM) GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, have been investigated and compared to lattice-matched (LM) GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cells. High-resolution X-ray diffraction was used to study the relaxation of strain by analysing reciprocal space maps. Threading dislocation density was estimated from cathodoluminescence image. SRIM simulation results have been applied for analysing the irradiation induced displacement damage and its effects on cell performance. The results show that the electrical parameters of both UMM and LM cells degraded more by 3 MeV proton compared to 8 MeV proton irradiation. The degradation of Voc and Isc depends on each other in both UMM and LM cells but have different features under proton irradiation due to different cell configurations, materials, and parameters etc. EQE spectra of UMM and LM cells mainly degrades in longer wavelength region due to the reduction of minority carrier diffusion length. Top GaInP subcell in UMM cell shows better radiation resistance than LM cell due to the higher In-P composition, and middle GaInAs middle subcell in UMM structure shows weaker radiation resistance because of the relatively higher indium composition.

Abstract: Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common type of non-melanoma skin cancer in white-skinned populations. cSCC is associated with sun exposure and aging, which is concomitant with an accumulation of senescent cells in the skin. The involvement of senescent cells in carcinogenesis has been highlighted in several cancer types and an interaction between cSCC cells and senescent cells is proposed, but still little explored. Tumor-associated effects are mostly attributed to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we compared two in vitro models of senescence, namely replicative senescence and UVB-stress induced premature senescence (UVB-SIPS), in human dermal fibroblasts and screened for expression of SASP-related genes in our models. Next, the impact of senescent fibroblasts on three cSCC isogenic cell lines, representing different stages of keratinocyte malignant transformation, was studied. Only a limited impact on cSCC cell lines’ growth and migration has been detected with conditioned media collected from senescent fibroblasts and indirect co-cultures. We then investigated the opposite interaction and found that cSCC cell lines maintained in indirect co-cultures with fibroblasts induced and reinforced their senescence state as shown by an increased proportion of cells positive for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and an increased expression of several SASP-related genes. Moreover, these effects were modulated according to the stage of tumorigenesis of the different cSCC cell lines used. Finally, cSCC cell lines-co-cultures are associated with NF-κB activation in HDFs. Understanding the interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment may have important influences in cancer research and therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Objective
Skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common, morbid, and frequently lethal malignancy and ranks as the sixth most deadly cancer worldwide. Hence, this study aims to explore the effect of microRNA-154 (miR-154) targeting WHSC1 on proliferation and apoptosis of SCC cells via the P53 signaling pathway.
Methods
The targeting relationship between WHSC1 and miR-154 was validated using dual-luciferase reporter assay. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were included, and SCC A431 and SCC-15 cell lines were cultured and transfected with miR-154 mimic, miR-154 inhibitor or siRNA-WHSC1. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were used for the miR-154 expression and levels of WHSC1, P53 signaling pathway- and apoptosis-related genes. MTT assay and flow cytometry were applied to determine the cell viability and apoptosis.
Results
WHSC1 is a target gene of miR-154. MiR-154 negatively regulated WHSC1 expression and inhibited the activation of P53 signaling pathway. In response to miR-154 mimic or siRNA-WHSC1, SCC A431 and SCC-15 cell lines exhibited increased expression of P73, P16 and Bax, decreased expression of WHSC1, P53, c-myc and Bcl-2, as well as attenuated cell viability and enhanced cell apoptosis. The treatment of miR-154 inhibitor reversed the tendency.
Conclusion
These results demonstrate that up-regulation of miR-154 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human skin SCC cells by down-regulating WHSC1 and blocking the P53 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Wafers and thicker slices of an entire n-type monocrystalline silicon ingot were studied using production-compatible electrical and optical characterization techniques. We investigated the capability of these techniques to detect efficiency limiting factors in the early phase of solar cell manufacturing. In addition to the standard characterization methods and parameters - carrier lifetime, resistivity, FTIR, photoluminescence (PL) - the OxyMap technique was used to evaluate the thermal history of the wafers, while the distribution of Bulk Micro Defects (BMD) was measured using Light Scattering Tomography (LST). PERT cells and samples with amorphous silicon surface passivation – deposited at low temperature – were produced from neighboring wafers to correlate silicon properties and solar cell efficiency results. An interesting indirect correlation was found between “as-grown” lifetime and cell performance, as both are influenced by the thermal history of the wafer. We also observed a very strong correlation between BMD position, measured by LST on as-grown samples, and defective areas on PERT cells localized by PL measurements. The LST measurements on heat treated samples (simulating the PERT cell process) showed the growth of BMDs in low efficiency areas. It indicates that the detection of harmful defects is possible even in the as-grown material using LST technique.

Abstract: Thin-film photovoltaic devices based on chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) material have demonstrated excellent power conversion efficiency. However, developing a low-cost fabrication process with less safety risk that compatible with large-scale production still stands as a major challenge. Using cheap and low toxic element Se vapor to replace the expensive and highly toxic H2Se which is widely used in sputtering-based industrial manufacture is an attractive solution. Received considerable attention, yet the devices fabricated from metallic precursor and element Se vapor still suffer from an inferior performance. In this work, we disclosed the main culprit behind this limitation—the ordered vacancy compounds (OVC) phase at the CIGS/Mo rear interface, which is induced by the drastic out-diffusion of Cu during the selenization. The detrimental OVC phase at the rear interface acts as a blocking barrier, and also results in enhanced rear interface recombination, and weakens the band bending in the hetero-junction, as manifested by the temperature-dependent current-voltage (J-V) measurements, KPFM measurements, and SCAPS-1D simulation. We found that the out-diffusion of Cu and the associated formation of OVC phase at the rear interface can be efficiently suppressed by turning the element Cu and In in as-sputtered precursor into Cu9(In,Ga)4 and Cu9Ga4 alloys using a co-sputtered metallic precursor with a thermal alloying treatment. With the rear interface modification, we significantly improved the device performance, with pronounced increase of Voc and fill factor. Our results indicate even higher efficiency can be achieved by further improving the doping density of the rear interface and optimizing the band gap.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) based thin film solar cells have recently drawn a growing research interest due to their increasing power conversion efficiency, proper bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and earth abundant nature. Herein, the Sb2Se3 thin films were prepared by close spaced sublimation (CSS) for efficient Sb2Se3 solar cells. The origin and the mechanisms of shunt current were analyzed. Non-ohmic space-charge limited current (SCLC) was identified to be an important contribution to the nonlinear shunt current in Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells. To tackle this issue, a high-resistance SnO2 buffer was introduced at the front contact. With the insertion of a SnO2 buffer, the micro-shunt paths were modified and a significant efficiency improvement to 5.18% was obtained.

Abstract: Nanotextured diamond-wire sawing (DWS) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells are successfully fabricated on an industrial scale. The nanotextures are achieved through reactive ion etching (RIE). By introducing the RIE-nanotextures, the DWS mc-Si solar cells with aluminum back-surface field (Al-BSF) structure exhibit an enhanced optoelectronic conversion, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 19.50%. This enhanced optoelectronic conversion is attributed to nanotexture-induced photon management effect, including both efficient reflection reduction and absorption enhancement, and which offset over the increased recombination of charge carriers. The DWS mc-Si solar cells are promising for industrial production due to the low raw material cost, high PCE, and manufacturing processes compatible with the existing production lines.

Abstract: We developed a new wet-chemical method to grow the high-quality tunnel silicon oxide (SiOx) layer by using a strong-oxidizing mixed acid, which consists of three volumes of HNO3 (68 wt%) and one volume of H2SO4 (98 wt%), named as the CNS (concentrated nitric and sulfuric) acid for short. In comparison with the HNO3 acid, the CNS acid grows high-quality SiOx layer with the higher oxidized state at 60 °C, where the relatively low temperature avoids the significant volatilization of acid and remains the quality of acid during the extending process. The results prove that the SiOx grown in the CNS acid benefits for the surface passivation of the n-type polysilicon passivated contact structure. An average gain of implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) by 2–10 mV and a reduction of single-side surface saturated dark current (J0) by 1–7 fA/cm2 are obtained by using the 60 °C CNS-acid grown SiOx to replace the 60 °C HNO3-acid grown one. Also, in comparison with the 90 °C HNO3 acid, the 60 °C CNS acid exhibits improved stability and repeatability for preparing the SiOx during the extending process. The CNS-acid grown SiOx helps the polysilicon passivated contact solar cell to raise the efficiency by ~ 0.15% on average. In summary, the CNS acid has shown the potential for industrial application, which improves not only the manufacturing process but also the device performances.

Abstract: All-inorganic perovskites suffer from low temperature phase instability and degradation under moisture and polar solvents. Here we have synthesized organic ligand assisted stable perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with uniform size ~10 nm. Varying the composition in CsPbBrxI3-x it was observed that CsPbBr1.5I1.5 could be an alternative solution for stable perovskite QDs. Photoluminescence (PL) decay showed comparable average lifetime useful for photovoltaic (PV) application. The photovoltaic devices made from CsPbBr1.5I1.5 showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) ~7.94% with open circuit voltage ~ 1.0 V, fill factor 0.70 and long term stability. This PCE is also the highest as compared to other PV reports for QDs with CsPbBr1.5I1.5 composition. Moreover this composition offers nearly hysteresis free perovskite device.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. However, the mechanism underlying the tumorigenesis of HCC is still unclear. Improper recruitment of Pescadillo homologue 1 (PES1) can lead to tumorigenesis in multiple cancer types, such as gastric cancer and colon cancer. Here, we reported that PES1 was upregulated and associated with a poor prognosis in HCC specimens. Next, we found that PES1 promoted the growth of HCC in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that the knockdown of PES1 decreased glycolysis via altering the gene expression of GLUT1, PKM2, ENO1, FBP1, and PCK1, which are related to glucose metabolism in HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that PES1 is regulated by bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and is partially responsible for modulating the antitumor effect of BET inhibitors in HCC. Taken together, our results suggest that PES1 plays an important role in promoting the proliferation of human liver cancer cells, suggesting that PES1 may be an ideal molecular target for HCC therapy.

Abstract: CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite materials deposited on ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs) undergo decomposition during annealing in N2 atmosphere. We found that this decomposition can be retarded by restricting sublimation. Moreover, the decomposition upon thermal annealing is highly suppressed by TiCl4 treatment of the ZnO ETLs. Finally, we present a facile method for prolonged annealing in sol–gel ZnO-based perovskite solar cells, which exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 16.5% at a small area of 0.098 cm2 and 15.1% at a large area of 1 cm2 (active area) under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination. This study shows that TiCl4 hydrolysis is an effective surface treatment for ZnO ETLs to be used in low-temperature and efficient sol–gel ZnO-based perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Graphene based heat mirror (i.e., graphene/Cu/graphene multilayer coating) was designed and developed to achieve enhanced optical absorption with tunable spectral selectivity. The concept of a heat mirror and a high/low/high refractive index stack was used to develop the graphene/Cu/graphene absorber and the transition from high transmittance to high absorptance was realized on quartz substrates. The thickness of the Cu layer has an important role in creating the destructive interference, for achieving high absorptance and low emittance. The refractive index of the multilayer graphene transferred on Si substrate was studied using phase-modulated spectroscopic ellipsometry. An absorptance of 0.91 and emittance of 0.22 was achieved for the SiO2/graphene/Cu/graphene multilayer coating. For the first time, the feasibility of graphene/Cu/graphene multilayer coating for photothermal applications have been demonstrated.

Abstract: Converting solar energy directly into electricity as a clean and renewable energy resource is immensely important to solving the energy crisis and environmental pollution problems induced by the consumption of fossil fuels. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide a technically and economically credible alternative that could challenge the dominance of conventional p-n junction photovoltaic devices in the solar energy market. DSSCs use dye molecules adsorbed at the surface of nanocrystalline oxide semiconductors such as TiO2 to collect sunlight. These thin films require a large surface area, to adsorb many dye molecules, and mesoporous channels so the electrolyte can permeate the film and regenerate the dye molecules. This favourable morphology is traditionally achieved by the random assembly of a network of nanoparticles by the sintering process. Two-photon polymerization is a 3D printing technique used to fabricate structures with feature resolutions down to 100 nm. We use this technique to fabricate TiO2 thin films of optimised 3D micro-design for use in DSSCs. Our films have a considerable advantage over the conventional (random assembly) films as it allows the implementation of light scattering designs which are shown to significantly enhance photocurrent in the cell by up to ~25%.

Abstract: A simulated and an experimental design of multilayer solar selective absorber coatings for high temperature applications is presented in this study. The optical tandem is composed of four layers deposited by magnetron sputtering on stainless steel substrates at room temperature. The first is a back-reflector tungsten layer, that is followed by two absorption layers based on WSiAlNx/ WSiAlOyNx structure for phase interference. The final layer is an antireflection layer of SiAlOx. The design was conducted with the help of SCOUT software creating a multilayer model based on transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) spectra of individual thin layers deposited on glass substrates. The final design shows simultaneously high solar absorptance α = 96.0% and low emissivity ε = 10.5% (calculated at 400 °C) together with high thermal stability at 450 °C, in air, and 600 °C in vacuum for 400 h and 300 h, respectively.

The perovskite solar cells based on additional I3- ions exhibited better photovoltaic performance, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.7%, being about 15% higher than that of the control device. The elucidation of defects and its suppression by employing additional I3- ions provide an important direction for defects elimination and future enhancement of perovskite solar cells efficiency.

Abstract: Herein, we clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of the organic solid additive (2,3-dihydroxypyridine, DOH) into the poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (PDPP3T:PCBM) photoactive blend system alters the nanoscale morphology and enhances the photovoltaic (PV) performance of the inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) based polymer solar cells (PSCs). The influence of DOH additive casted PDPP3T: PCBM thin films on the optical, morphology and structural features is evaluated and correlated with PV characteristics. Topography images through atomic force microscopy reveal that the incorporation of DOH into PDPP3T: PCBM induces a finer nanoscale phase segregation between polymer and fullerene domains with fibrillar morphology. The PV performance of the DOH processed PDPP3T: PCBM devices is evaluated by current-voltage (J-V) characteristics and compared with pristine and 1, 8-diiodooctane (DIO) modified PDPP3T: PCBM devices. Interestingly, the incorporation of DOH (0.5 wt%) into PDPP3T: PCBM device witnessed the best PCE of 6.36%, which is significantly higher (69.1%) than that of the reference (3.76%). This significant enhancement in the performance of the device is mainly attributed to a dramatic increase in the short-circuit current density and fill-factor due to the improved bicontinuous interpenetrated phase separation and balanced charge transport. In addition, the measurements on photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage reveal that DOH incorporated devices exhibit higher mobility and charge carrier density as compared to those of pristine modified BHJ PSCs. The presence of vicinal functional groups in DOH contributes to the possible molecular level interactions with the blend components and accounts for the morphology and device performance enhancements.

Abstract: In this work, we identified the problem faced by conventional successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process in producing uniform nickel hydroxide films as the homogeneous precipitation reaction in water. Subsequently we proposed a novel SILAR recipe with a modified rinsing step and successfully demonstrated, for the first time, a layer-by-layer coating of uniform nickel hydroxide thin film without surface structures or agglomerated precipitates. In addition, we explored and demonstrated the capability of the proposed SILAR process in incorporating additional element such as aluminum into the nickel hydroxide film. The aluminum incorporated nickel hydroxide film shows improved electrochromic stability evidenced by reducing the degradation in coloration efficiency from 46% to 6%. The average coloration efficient is reported as 22 cm2/C and the response time is 4.5 s for bleaching and 4 s for coloration.

Abstract: Through a combination of sol-gel based self-assembly and plasma based approach we have developed highly transparent, self-ordered, superhydrophilic and photoactive TiO2 thin film coatings. TiO2 sol used for such coatings comprises a block copolymer which functions as a structure directing agent. This structure directing agent aid to formation of regular pores in the TiO2 thin film, thereby, remarkably reducing the refractive index values (~ 1.31) and enhancing the transparency (4% antireflection gain) of the coatings. Further, such porous TiO2 coatings show an excellent ability to photo-decompose organic pollutants, due to the photocatalytic ability of such metal oxide semiconductor. Enhancement in the photocatalytic activity has been obtained by porous surface created using a block copolymer and shifting the band gap energy by incorporating nitrogen so as to utilize part of the visible region of the solar spectrum for photocatalysis. An optimum condition is achieved by varying the RF self-bias potential and time of plasma treatment. Nitrogen plasma treatment, in addition to enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is also found to enhance the mechanical stability and hydrophilicity, without hampering the optical transmission of coatings. Such coatings are also found to exhibit superhydrophilicity with water contact angle (WCA) < 5° under optimized condition. Thus, the coatings developed, qualify as a suitable candidate to be applied on solar PV panel and other energy devices. Treatment with nitrogen plasma extends the photocatalytic activity towards visible region of the spectrum and also ensures the mechanical stability of the otherwise porous network.

Abstract: Perfect absorption of electromagnetic wave is emerging as a promising technology for its potential applications in harvesting solar energy, infrared detection and photovoltaic devices. Recent studies have reported a variety of plasmonic or meta-material structures, which are designed and fabricated to provide broadband absorption by utilizing multiple resonators in a composite unit cell. Coupled plasmonic-photonic micro-cavities, formed by using the colloidal crystal that does not have closed packed structure as the structural template, are surprisingly found to be efficient infrared absorption devices in an ultra-broadband frequency range. Taking the absorptivity above 0.9 into account, the operation bandwidth is up to 2.851 μm in the infrared range. The excellent absorption capability can be attributed to the cooperation effects of the plasmonic resonances by the metal caps and the photonic modes by the colloids. The absorber exhibits polarization-independent and wide-angle behaviors. These findings not only reveal the advantages of colloidal crystals as low-cost materials for ultra-broadband absorbers, but also provide inspiration for future development of high-performance, large-area infrared optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: A central quantity to assess the high quality of monocrystalline silicon (on scales beyond mere purity) is the minority charge carrier lifetime. We demonstrate that the lifetime in high purity float zone material can be improved beyond existing observations, thanks to a deeper understanding of grown-in defects and how they can be permanently annihilated. In a first step we investigate the influence of several process sequences on the lifetime by applying a low temperature superacid passivation treatment. We find that a pre-treatment consisting of an oxidation at 1050 °C followed by a POCl3 diffusion at 900 °C can improve the lifetime by deactivating or eliminating grown-in defects. Then, pre-treated wafers of different float zone materials are passivated with three state-of-the-art layer stacks. Very high effective lifetime values are measured, thereby demonstrating the high quality of the surface passivation schemes and the pre-treated silicon wafers. The measured effective lifetimes exceed previous records, and we report an effective lifetime of 225 ms measured on a 200 µm thick 100 Ω cm n-type silicon wafer symmetrically passivated with a layer stack of a thin thermally grown oxide and a polycrystalline layer (the TOPCon layer stack).

Abstract: Semiconductor surface clean is sometimes perceived as costly but long recognized as pivotal in determining the final semiconductor device performance and yield. In this contribution, we investigated the effectiveness of crystalline silicon surface cleaning by a simple UV-ozone process in comparison to the industry standard RCA clean for silicon photovoltaic applications. We present a unique method of processing the silicon surface effectively by UV-ozone cleaning. Despite being simple, UV-ozone cleaning results in a superior surface passivation quality that is comparable to high-quality RCA clean. When used as a stack dielectric—UV-ozone oxide overlaid by aluminum oxide—the thickness of UV-ozone oxide plays an important role in determining the passivation quality. Of all treatment times, 15 min of UV-ozone treatment results in an outstanding passivation quality, achieving the effective carrier lifetime of 3 ms and saturation current density of 5 fA/cm2. In addition, we present a simple and effective technique to extract values of electron/hole capture cross-section for the purpose of analyzing the interface passivation quality from already measured surface recombination parameters of saturation current density, interfacial trap density and total fixed charge, instead of measuring on the separately prepared metal-insulated-semiconductor (MIS) samples by the techniques: frequency-dependent parallel conductance or deep-level transient spectroscopy.

Abstract: We examine the regeneration kinetics of passivated emitter and rear solar cells (PERCs) fabricated on boron-doped p-type Czochralski-grown silicon wafers in darkness by electron injection via application of a forward bias voltage at elevated temperature (140 °C) in order to discriminate between electronic and photonic effects. Based on these dark regeneration experiments, we address the existing inconsistency regarding the measured linear dependence of the regeneration rate constant on the excess carrier density. Using the method of dark regeneration by current injection into the solar cell, we are able to measure the total recombination current of the solar cell at the actual regeneration temperature under applied voltage, i.e., at the physically relevant regeneration conditions. The direct comparison of the regeneration rate constant as a function of electronically injected carrier concentration in the dark and the regeneration rate constant during illumination clearly shows that the regeneration is a purely electronically stimulated effect and that photons are not directly involved.

Abstract: Ultrathin crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells represent an important technology development direction for reducing material usage and thus lowering the cost of solar electricity. Here, we demonstrate a prototype device with high efficiency assisted by a micro-/nano-structured polycarbonate thin nanofur film inspired by water ferns. The ultrathin c-Si solar cells consist of a 17 μm-thick c-Si absorber and exhibit an efficiency of up to 17.3% and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.8 mA cm−2. With the assistance of the thin nanofur, the efficiency is increased to 18.1% due to an increase in Jsc to 37.4 mA cm−2. The photocurrent enhancement is attributed to, firstly, a more favorable refractive index transition due to the polymer addition and, secondly, the high forward scattering of the structured film, which increases the optical pathlength within the ultrathin absorber layer of the devices. To our knowledge, the present prototype device demonstrates the highest Jsc and efficiency in the area of ultrathin c-Si solar cells with an absorber layer of less than 20 µm.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs) has been world-widely accepted as an effective technology for energy saving. In this study, Micro-Encapsulated PCMs (MEPCMs) were developed from Al-Si alloys, in which four kinds of Al-Si microspheres with different Al-Si compositions: Al-12%Si, Al-17%Si, Al-20%Si, and Al-30%Si (mass%) were encapsulated by two facile steps for controlling heat storage property. First, boehmite film was formed over the Al-Si microspheres as a precursor shell during boiling in distilled water. Subsequently, the boehmite-coated particles were oxidized by pure oxygen at the high temperatures to ensure the formation of a stable Al2O3 shell. Three different temperatures, 1100 °C, 1150 °C, and 1200 °C, were chosen to study the effect of temperature on the product; the shell morphology, structure, and latent heat storage capacity. Interestingly, the results revealed an increase in MEPCM thermal storage capacity with decreasing Si content and lowering the temperature. The MEPCM melting point was almost identical to its eutectic temperature at ~577 °C, in contrast the larger supercooling was observed for samples with the higher Si content. The cyclic durability of MEPCM was also evaluated through repeated heating and cooling processes in air. The obtained results showed no significant change in both MEPCM structure and thermal storage capacity. It indicated a good repetition durability of MEPCMs oxidized at high temperatures. In conclusion, the Al-Si microencapsulated PCMs appealed great potential as MEPCMs for use in high-temperature thermal energy applications.
