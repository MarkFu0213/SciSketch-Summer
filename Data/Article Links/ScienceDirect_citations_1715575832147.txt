Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given that HCC is an extraordinarily heterogeneous malignant disease, finding an effective therapeutic strategy for treating it has been difficult. Because of the importance of angiogenesis in tumorigenesis, targeting the more homogenous HCC endothelial cells may be a better therapeutic strategy. In a unpublished manuscript, we found that the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 (MMP2/9) were reduced in human HCC tissues that overexpressed DNA damage repair gene general transcription factor II subunit H2 (GTF2H2). This suggested that GTF2H2 may have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that GTF2H2 acts as an anti-angiogenesis gene. However, our results showed that GTF2H2 overexpression had no effect on endothelial cell viability, migration, or permeability. To our surprise, treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with the culture medium of Huh 7 cells overexpressing GTF2H2 could inhibit their viability, migration, and permeability. We then isolated the culture medium into exosomes and other components from the culture medium. Only GTF2H2-enriched exosomes could inhibit the viability, migration, tube formation, and permeability of HUVECs. Our results suggest that overexpressing GTF2H2 had no effect on HUVECs, while GTF2H2 enriched exosomes from Huh7 cells could inhibit HUVEC phenotypes such as proliferation and migration. Therefore, GTF2H2-enriched exosomes can possibly be utilized as a novel drug for treating HCC and also serve as a potential molecular target for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
ATG9A is a highly conserved membrane protein required for autophagy initiation. It is trafficked from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the phagophore to act as a membrane source for autophagosome expansion. Here, we show that ATG9A is not just a passenger protein in the TGN but rather works in concert with GRASP55, a stacking factor for Golgi structure, to organize Golgi dynamics and integrity. Upon heat stress, the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH9 is promoted to ubiquitinate ATG9A in the form of K63 conjugation, and the nondegradable ubiquitinated ATG9A disperses from the Golgi apparatus to the cytoplasm more intensely, accompanied by inhibiting GRASP55 oligomerization, further resulting in Golgi fragmentation. Knockout of ATG9A or MARCH9 largely prevents Golgi fragmentation and protects Golgi functions under heat and other Golgi stresses. Our results reveal a noncanonical function of ATG9A for Golgi dynamics and suggest the pathway for sensing Golgi stress via the MARCH9/ATG9A axis.

Abstract: Background
The development of tissue-engineered scaffolds with electrical properties is the primary motivation of novel regenerative medicine. Electroconductive scaffolds are designed to mimic the injured tissue environment's electrical properties and regulate cellular behavior - growth, proliferation, and differentiation - that could stimulate the injured nerve's regeneration.
Methods
We fabricated dedicated electroconductive scaffolds and customized an appropriate device with an external current supply to expose cells on the scaffold to electrical stimulation (ES). Next, we isolated rat adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and performed in vitro experiments that combine cells, an electroconductive scaffold, NGF (nerve growth factor), and ES (90 mV/mm, constant, for four days). Finally, we checked cellular activity as proliferation, viability, morphology, the neurogenic differentiation potential of ASCs, cell alignment, and karyotype.
Results
We observed that the electrical stimulation did not change the viability and chromosome stability of rat ASCs, but altered slightly proliferation compared to non-stimulated cells. The combined effect of a scaffold, NGF, and ES caused morphology changes and enhancement of ASCs neuronal differentiation as indicated in βIII-tubulin expression, actin organization, and upregulation of neurogenic gene expression.
Conclusions
We developed an electroconductive scaffold and customized device for in vitro study with many experimental variants. Based on our results, we presumed that the established study scheme - including an electroconductive scaffold, NGF and ES - is biocompatible and could guide ASCs to differentiate in neurogenic lineage, thus may be potentially applied in nerve injury regeneration.

Abstract: Background
Standard therapy of osteosarcoma (OS) rests on cytotoxic regimes, which dramatically limits the further improvement in the prognosis of patients with OS. Preclinical models of OS are extremely urgent to break this impasse.
Materials and Methods
Here, we describe our experience of developing patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) using surgical samples from patients with OS. All the xenografts growing subcutaneously in mice will be identified pathologically and genetically. Furthermore, we explored the consistency of the drug sensitivity between the PDX models and corresponding patients against specific regimens.
Results
We generated nine OS PDXs from 21 surgical resections of primary OS tumors, with an engraftment rate of 42.9 %. Morphological and immunohistochemical (SATB2, MDM2, CDK4, and Ki67) studies and whole-exome sequencing showed a remarkable similarity between the patient’s tumor and corresponding PDX, which was maintained over several passages in mice. A therapeutic combination of Pirarubicin and Cisplatin was tested against two OS PDX models, in which the corresponding patient was insensitive and sensitive to the regimen, respectively.
Conclusion
The panel of OS PDX models faithfully mirrored morphologic and genetic features of OS, representing reliable models to test therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) represents a major challenge for anticancer therapies. An integrated, multidimensional, multiregional approach dissecting ITH of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor microenvironment (TME) is employed at the single-cell level with mass cytometry (CyTOF), multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and at the bulk level with whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, and methylation profiling. Multiregional analyses reveal unexpected conservation of immune composition within each individual patient, with profound differences among patients, presenting patient-specific tumor immune microenvironment signatures despite underlying genetic heterogeneity from clonal evolution. Spatial proteogenomic TME analysis using MxIF identifies 14 distinct cellular neighborhoods and, conversely, demonstrated architectural heterogeneity among different tumor regions. Tumor-expressed cytokines are identified as key determinants of the TME and correlate with clinical outcome. Overall, this work signifies that spatial ITH occurs in ccRCC, which may drive clinical heterogeneity and warrants further interrogation to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant replication causes cells lacking BRCA2 to enter mitosis with under-replicated DNA, which activates a repair mechanism known as mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). Here, we identify genome-wide the sites where MiDAS reactions occur when BRCA2 is abrogated. High-resolution profiling revealed that these sites are different from MiDAS at aphidicolin-induced common fragile sites in that they map to genomic regions replicating in the early S-phase, which are close to early-firing replication origins, are highly transcribed, and display R-loop-forming potential. Both transcription inhibition in early S-phase and RNaseH1 overexpression reduced MiDAS in BRCA2-deficient cells, indicating that transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) and R-loops are the source of MiDAS. Importantly, the MiDAS sites identified in BRCA2-deficient cells also represent hotspots for genomic rearrangements in BRCA2-mutated breast tumors. Thus, our work provides a mechanism for how tumor-predisposing BRCA2 inactivation links transcription-induced DNA damage with mitotic DNA repair to fuel the genomic instability characteristic of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) were among the first identified bacterial virulence factors. Canonical ART toxins are delivered into host cells where they modify essential proteins, thereby inactivating cellular processes and promoting pathogenesis. Our understanding of ARTs has since expanded beyond protein-targeting toxins to include antibiotic inactivation and DNA damage repair. Here, we report the discovery of RhsP2 as an ART toxin delivered between competing bacteria by a type VI secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A structure of RhsP2 reveals that it resembles protein-targeting ARTs such as diphtheria toxin. Remarkably, however, RhsP2 ADP-ribosylates 2′-hydroxyl groups of double-stranded RNA, and thus, its activity is highly promiscuous with identified cellular targets including the tRNA pool and the RNA-processing ribozyme, ribonuclease P. Consequently, cell death arises from the inhibition of translation and disruption of tRNA processing. Overall, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism of bacterial antagonism and uncover an unprecedented activity catalyzed by ART enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a uniformly fatal pediatric cancer driven by oncohistones that do not readily lend themselves to drug development. To identify druggable targets for DMG, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen that reveals a DMG selective dependency on the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. This metabolic vulnerability reflects an elevated rate of uridine/uracil degradation that depletes DMG cells of substrates for the alternate salvage pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. A clinical stage inhibitor of DHODH (rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pathway) diminishes uridine-5′-phosphate (UMP) pools, generates DNA damage, and induces apoptosis through suppression of replication forks—an “on-target” effect, as shown by uridine rescue. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy imaging demonstrates that this DHODH inhibitor (BAY2402234) accumulates in the brain at therapeutically relevant concentrations, suppresses de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in vivo, and prolongs survival of mice bearing intracranial DMG xenografts, highlighting BAY2402234 as a promising therapy against DMGs.

Abstract: Summary
Aminoglycosides (AGs) are potent antibiotics that are capable of treating a wide variety of life-threatening infections; however, they are ototoxic and cause irreversible damage to cochlear hair cells. Despite substantial progress, little is known about the molecular pathways critical for hair cell function and survival that are affected by AG exposure. We demonstrate here that gentamicin, a representative AG antibiotic, binds to and within minutes triggers translocation of RIPOR2 in murine hair cells from stereocilia to the pericuticular area. Then, by interacting with a central autophagy component, GABARAP, RIPOR2 affects autophagy activation. Reducing the expression of RIPOR2 or GABARAP completely prevents AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss in mice. Additionally, abolishing the expression of PINK1 or Parkin, two key mitochondrial autophagy proteins, prevents hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss caused by AG. In summary, our study demonstrates that RIPOR2-mediated autophagic dysfunction is essential for AG-induced hearing loss.

Abstract: Summary
Oxytocin alters autonomic functions besides social behaviors. However, the central neuronal links between hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons and the autonomic nervous system remain unclear. Here we show that oxytocinergic neurons in the rat paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a pivotal site for energy homeostasis, innervate sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral medullary raphe region (rMR) to stimulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and cardiovascular functions. Oxytocin receptor stimulation in the rMR evokes BAT thermogenesis and tachycardia. In vivo optogenetic stimulation of the PVH→rMR long-range oxytocinergic pathway, using a virus-mediated system for amplified gene expression in oxytocinergic neurons, not only elicits BAT thermogenic and cardiac responses but also potentiates sympathetic responses evoked by glutamatergic transmission in the rMR. The PVH→rMR oxytocinergic pathway connects the hypothalamic circuit for energy homeostasis to thermogenic and cardiac sympathetic outflow, and, therefore, its defects may cause obesity and impaired thermoregulation, as seen in Prader-Willi syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus infection of B lymphocytes elicits diverse host responses via well-adapted transcriptional control dynamics. Consequently, this host-pathogen interaction provides a powerful system to explore fundamental processes leading to consensus fate decisions. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to construct a genome-wide multistate model of B cell fates upon EBV infection. Additional single-cell data from human tonsils reveal correspondence of model states to analogous in vivo phenotypes within secondary lymphoid tissue, including an EBV+ analog of multipotent activated precursors that can yield early memory B cells. These resources yield exquisitely detailed perspectives of the transforming cellular landscape during an oncogenic viral infection that simulates antigen-induced B cell activation and differentiation. Thus, they support investigations of state-specific EBV-host dynamics, effector B cell fates, and lymphomagenesis. To demonstrate this potential, we identify EBV infection dynamics in FCRL4+/TBX21+ atypical memory B cells that are pathogenically associated with numerous immune disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear protein high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) can be actively secreted by activated immune cells and functions as a proinflammatory cytokine. Regulation of HMGB1 secretion is critical for treatment of HMGB1-mediated inflammation and related diseases. This study demonstrates that S-nitrosylation (SNO; the covalent binding of nitric oxide [NO] to cysteine thiols) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-derived NO at Cys106 is essential and sufficient for inflammation-elicited HMGB1 secretion. iNOS deletion or inhibition or Cys106Ser mutation prevents lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and/or poly(I:C)-elicited HMGB1 secretion. NO donors induce SNO of HMGB1 and reproduce inflammogen-triggered HMGB1 secretion. SNO of HMGB1 promotes its proinflammatory and neurodegenerative effects. Intranigral HMGB1 injection induces chronic microglial activation, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and locomotor deficits, the key features of Parkinson’s disease (PD), in wild-type, but not Mac1 (CD11b/CD18)-deficient, mice. This study indicates pivotal roles for SNO modification in HMGB1 secretion and HMGB1-Mac1 interaction for inflammatory neurodegeneration, identifying a mechanistic basis for PD development.

Abstract: Summary
The primary visual cortex signals the onset of light and dark stimuli with ON and OFF cortical pathways. Here, we demonstrate that both pathways generate similar response increments to large homogeneous surfaces and their response average increases with surface brightness. We show that, in cat visual cortex, response dominance from ON or OFF pathways is bimodally distributed when stimuli are smaller than one receptive field center but unimodally distributed when they are larger. Moreover, whereas small bright stimuli drive opposite responses from ON and OFF pathways (increased versus suppressed activity), large bright surfaces drive similar response increments. We show that this size-brightness relation emerges because strong illumination increases the size of light surfaces in nature and both ON and OFF cortical neurons receive input from ON thalamic pathways. We conclude that visual scenes are perceived as brighter when the average response increments from ON and OFF cortical pathways become stronger.

Abstract: Summary
The influence of the microbiota on viral transmission and replication is well appreciated. However, its impact on retroviral pathogenesis outside of transmission/replication control remains unknown. Using murine leukemia virus (MuLV), we found that some commensal bacteria promoted the development of leukemia induced by this retrovirus. The promotion of leukemia development by commensals is due to suppression of the adaptive immune response through upregulation of several negative regulators of immunity. These negative regulators include Serpinb9b and Rnf128, which are associated with a poor prognosis of some spontaneous human cancers. Upregulation of Serpinb9b is mediated by sensing of bacteria by the NOD1/NOD2/RIPK2 pathway. This work describes a mechanism by which the microbiota enhances tumorigenesis within gut-distant organs and points at potential targets for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Spermidine is essential for cellular growth and acts as a prerequisite of hypusination, a post-translational modification of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), allowing the translation of polyproline-containing proteins. Here, we show that oncogenic Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) increases spermidine synthesis and eIF5A hypusination to enhance expression of polyproline-containing latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) for viral episomal maintenance. KSHV upregulates intracellular spermidine levels by dysregulating polyamine metabolic pathways in three-dimensional (3D) culture and 2D de novo infection conditions. Increased intracellular spermidine leads to increased eIF5A hypusination, ultimately enhancing LANA expression. In contrast, inhibition of spermidine synthesis or eIF5A hypusination alleviates LANA expression, decreasing viral episomal maintenance and KSHV-infected cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, which is reversed by spermidine supplement. This demonstrates that KSHV hijacks spermidine synthesis and eIF5A hypusination pathways to enhance LANA expression for viral episomal maintenance, suggesting polyamine metabolism and eIF5A hypusination as therapeutic targets for KSHV-induced tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Healthy aging is an ambitious aspiration for humans, but neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), strongly affect quality of life. Using an integrated omics approach, we investigate alterations in the molecular composition of postmortem hippocampus samples of healthy persons and individuals with AD. Profound differences are apparent between control and AD male and female cohorts in terms of up- and downregulated metabolic pathways. A decrease in the insulin response is evident in AD when comparing the female with the male group. The serine metabolism (linked to the glycolytic pathway and generating the N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor coagonist D-serine) is also significantly modulated: the D-Ser/total serine ratio represents a way to counteract age-related cognitive decline in healthy men and during AD onset in women. These results show how AD changes and, in certain respects, almost reverses sex-specific proteomic and metabolomic profiles, highlighting how different pathophysiological mechanisms are active in men and women.

Abstract: Summary
Limb patterning by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), via either graded spatial or temporal signal integration, is a paradigm for “morphogen” function, yet how Shh instructs distinct digit identities remains controversial. Here, we bypass the Shh requirement in cell survival during outgrowth and demonstrate that a transient, early Shh pulse is both necessary and sufficient for normal mouse limb development. Shh response is only short range and is limited to the Shh-expressing zone during this time window. Shh patterns digits 1–3, anterior to this zone, by an indirect mechanism rather than direct spatial or temporal signal integration. Using a genetic relay-signaling assay, we discover that Shh also specifies digit 1/thumb (thought to be exclusively Shh independent) indirectly, and this finding implicates Shh in a unique regulatory hierarchy for digit 1 evolutionary adaptations such as opposable thumbs. This study illuminates Shh as a trigger for an indirect downstream network that becomes rapidly self-sustaining, with mechanistic relevance for limb development, regeneration, and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) lyse target cells by delivering lytic granules that contain the pore former perforin to the cytotoxic immunological synapse. Here, we establish that opposing cytoskeletal forces drive lytic granule polarization and simultaneously shape T cell synapse topography to enhance target perforation. At the cell rear, actomyosin contractility drives the anterograde movement of lytic granules toward the nucleus. At the synapse, dynein-derived forces induce negatively curved membrane pockets to which granules are transported around the nucleus. These highly concave degranulation pockets are located directly opposite positively curved bulges on the target cell membrane. We identify a curvature bias in the action of perforin, which preferentially perforates positively curved tumor cell membrane. Together, these findings demonstrate murine and human T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to be a highly tuned mechano-biochemical system, in which the forces that polarize lytic granules locally bend the synaptic membrane to favor the unidirectional perforation of the target cell.

Abstract: Summary
Psoriasis has long been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, a causal link is yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate that imiquimod-induced psoriasis (IMQ-pso) in mice disrupts gut homeostasis, characterized by increased proportions of colonic CX3CR1hi macrophages, altered cytokine production, and bacterial dysbiosis. Gut microbiota from these mice produce higher levels of succinate, which induce de novo proliferation of CX3CR1hi macrophages ex vivo, while disrupted gut homeostasis primes IMQ-pso mice for more severe colitis with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) challenge. These results demonstrate that changes in the gut environment in psoriasis lead to greater susceptibility to IBD in mice, suggesting a two-hit requirement, that is, psoriasis-induced altered gut homeostasis and a secondary environmental challenge. This may explain the increased prevalence of IBD in patients with psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation, both as pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD), crosstalk to exacerbate degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and PD progression. However, the mechanism underlying their interaction is poorly understood, which obstructs effective therapeutic inhibition of α-syn-induced neuroinflammation. Here, we initiate from structure-based interaction predictions and find that receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) serves as a receptor of α-syn fibrils on microglia. Results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mutagenesis validate that the V domain of RAGE that contains an alkaline surface can bind with acidic C-terminal residues of α-syn. Furthermore, the binding of α-syn fibrils with RAGE induces neuroinflammation, which is blocked by both genetic depletion of RAGE and inhibitor FPS-ZM1. Our work shows the important role, as well as the structural mechanism, of RAGE in mediating the inflammatory response of microglia to α-syn fibrils, which may help to establish effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate α-syn-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal damage.

Abstract: Segmentation of 3D images to identify cells and their molecular outputs can be difficult and tedious. Machine learning algorithms provide a promising alternative to manual analysis as emerging 3D image processing technology can save considerable time. For those unfamiliar with machine learning or 3D image analysis, the rapid advancement of the field can make navigating the newest software options confusing. In this paper, two open-source machine learning algorithms, Cellpose and Stardist, are compared in their application on a 3D light sheet dataset counting fluorescently stained proliferative cell nuclei. The effects of image tiling and background subtraction are shown through image analysis pipelines for both algorithms. Based on our analysis, the relative ease of use of Cellpose and the absence of need to train a model leaves it a strong option for 3D cell segmentation despite relatively longer processing times. When Cellpose's pretrained model yields results that are not of sufficient quality, or the analysis of a large dataset is required, Stardist may be more appropriate. Despite the time it takes to train the model, Stardist can create a model specialized to the users' dataset that can be iteratively improved until predictions are satisfactory with far lower processing time relative to other methods.

Abstract: Summary
Sporadic pituitary adenomas occur in over 10% of the population. Hormone-secreting adenomas, including those causing Cushing’s disease (CD), cause severe morbidity and early mortality. Mechanistic studies of CD are hindered by a lack of in vitro models and control normal human pituitary glands. Here, we surgically annotate adenomas and adjacent normal glands in 25 of 34 patients. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of 27594 cells, we identify CD adenoma transcriptomic signatures compared with adjacent normal cells, with validation by bulk RNA-seq, DNA methylation, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. CD adenoma cells include a subpopulation of proliferating, terminally differentiated corticotrophs. In CD adenomas, we find recurrent promoter hypomethylation and transcriptional upregulation of PMAIP1 (encoding pro-apoptotic BH3-only bcl-2 protein noxa) but paradoxical noxa downregulation. Using primary CD adenoma cell cultures and a corticotroph-enriched mouse cell line, we find that selective proteasomal inhibition with bortezomib stabilizes noxa and induces apoptosis, indicating its utility as an anti-tumor agent.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer driver mutations often display mutual exclusion or co-occurrence, underscoring the key role of epistasis in carcinogenesis. However, estimating the magnitude of epistasis and quantifying its effect on tumor evolution remains a challenge. We develop a method (Coselens) to quantify conditional selection on the excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in cancer genes. Coselens infers the number of drivers per gene in different partitions of a cancer genomics dataset using covariance-based mutation models and determines whether coding mutations in a gene affect selection for drivers in any other gene. Using Coselens, we identify 296 conditionally selected gene pairs across 16 cancer types in the TCGA dataset. Conditional selection affects 25%–50% of driver substitutions in tumors with >2 drivers. Conditionally co-selected genes form modular networks, whose structures challenge the traditional interpretation of within-pathway mutual exclusivity and across-pathway synergy, suggesting a more complex scenario where gene-specific across-pathway epistasis shapes differentiated cancer subtypes.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic dysfunction mutations can impair energy sensing and cause cancer. Loss of function of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) results in various forms of cancer typified by pheochromocytoma (PC). Here we delineate a signaling cascade where the loss of SDHB induces the Warburg effect, triggers dysregulation of [Ca2+]i, and aberrantly activates calpain and protein kinase Cdk5, through conversion of its cofactor from p35 to p25. Consequently, aberrant Cdk5 initiates a phospho-signaling cascade where GSK3 inhibition inactivates energy sensing by AMP kinase through dephosphorylation of the AMP kinase γ subunit, PRKAG2. Overexpression of p25-GFP in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells also elicits this phosphorylation signaling and causes PC. A potent Cdk5 inhibitor, MRT3-007, reverses this phospho-cascade, invoking a senescence-like phenotype. This therapeutic approach halted tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we reveal an important mechanistic feature of metabolic sensing and demonstrate that its dysregulation underlies tumor progression in PC and likely other cancers.

Abstract: KRas-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP) has been identified as crucial for the appropriate localization and functioning of the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) that mediate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we used siRNA knockdown of KRAP expression in HeLa and HEK293 cells to examine the roles of KRAP in the generation of IP3-mediated local Ca2+ puffs and global, cell-wide Ca2+ signals. High resolution Ca2+ imaging revealed that the mean amplitude of puffs was strongly reduced by KRAP knockdown, whereas the Ca2+ flux during openings of individual IP3R channels was little affected. In both control and KRAP knockdown cells the numbers of functional channels in the clusters underlying puff sites were stochastically distributed following a Poisson relationship, but the mean number of functional channels per site was reduced by about two thirds by KRAP knockdown. We conclude that KRAP is required for activity of IP3R channels at puff sites and stochastically ‘licenses’ the function of individual channels on a one-to-one basis, rather than determining the functioning of the puff site as a whole. In addition to puff activity (‘punctate’ Ca2+ release), global, cell-wide Ca2+ signals evoked by higher levels of IP3 are further composed from a discrete ‘diffuse’ mode of Ca2+ release. By applying fluctuation analysis to isolate the punctate component during global Ca2+ signals, we find that KRAP knockdown suppresses to similar extents punctate and diffuse Ca2+ release in wild-type cells and in HEK293 cells exclusively expressing type 1 and type 3 IP3Rs. Thus, KRAP appears essential for the functioning of the IP3Rs involved in diffuse Ca2+ release as well as the clustered IP3Rs that generate local Ca2+ puffs.

Abstract: Summary
Development of the C. elegans gonad has long been studied as a model of organogenesis driven by collective cell migration. A somatic cell named the distal tip cell (DTC) is thought to serve as the leader of following germ cells; yet, the mechanism for DTC propulsion and maneuvering remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the DTC is not self-propelled but rather is pushed by the proliferating germ cells. Proliferative pressure pushes the DTC forward, against the resistance of the basement membrane in front. The DTC locally secretes metalloproteases that degrade the impeding membrane, resulting in gonad elongation. Turning of the gonad is achieved by polarized DTC-matrix adhesions. The asymmetrical traction results in a bending moment on the DTC. Src and Cdc42 regulate integrin adhesion polarity, whereas an external netrin signal determines DTC orientation. Our findings challenge the current view of DTC migration and offer a distinct framework to understand organogenesis.

Abstract: Blood vessel is one of the ‘pathways’ for cancer to metastasize, in which cells are exposed to the fluid shear stress. Although most cells are damaged by fluid shear stress, a small number of tumor cells survive and metastasize when they are exposed to low shear stress (LSS) of tiny capillary. It is important to study the survival state of damaged cells during LSS. In this study, high shear stress (HSS) was applied to simulate the blood circulation and damage cells. The viability and mitochondrial function of cells were detected after HSS and LSS loading, respectively. Further, the expression of mitochondrial related proteins and genes were detected by western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The role of cytochrome c (Cyt C) was also verified in this process. The experimental results showed that the viability of HSS damaged cells was increased significantly when they were exposed to LSS subsequently. The function of mitochondria was improved via reducing the release of Cyt C by LSS during this process. This study is expected to provide potential target for suppressing hematogenous metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the primary treatment for unresectable and metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs). However, tumors frequently develop chemoresistance. Here, we established a primary and orthotopic MIBC mouse model with gene-edited organoids to recapitulate the full course of chemotherapy in patients. We found that partial squamous differentiation, called semi-squamatization, is associated with acquired chemoresistance in both mice and human MIBCs. Multi-omics analyses showed that cathepsin H (CTSH) is correlated with chemoresistance and semi-squamatization. Cathepsin inhibition by E64 treatment induces full squamous differentiation and pyroptosis, and thus specifically restrains chemoresistant MIBCs. Mechanistically, E64 treatment activates the tumor necrosis factor pathway, which is required for the terminal differentiation and pyroptosis of chemoresistant MIBC cells. Our study revealed that semi-squamatization is a type of lineage plasticity associated with chemoresistance, suggesting that differentiation via targeting of CTSH is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant MIBCs.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding how bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria remains an open question. Previous work has proposed that primary drug-target corruption leads to increased energetic demands, resulting in the generation of reactive metabolic byproducts (RMBs), particularly reactive oxygen species, that contribute to antibiotic-induced cell death. Studies have challenged this hypothesis by pointing to antibiotic lethality under anaerobic conditions. Here, we show that treatment of Escherichia coli with bactericidal antibiotics under anaerobic conditions leads to changes in the intracellular concentrations of central carbon metabolites, as well as the production of RMBs, particularly reactive electrophilic species (RES). We show that antibiotic treatment results in DNA double-strand breaks and membrane damage and demonstrate that antibiotic lethality under anaerobic conditions can be decreased by RMB scavengers, which reduce RES accumulation and mitigate associated macromolecular damage. This work indicates that RMBs, generated in response to antibiotic-induced energetic demands, contribute in part to antibiotic lethality under anaerobic conditions.

Abstract: Summary
RAF kinases are RAS-activated enzymes that initiate signaling through the MAPK cascade to control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we describe the structure of the full-length RAF1 protein in complex with HSP90 and CDC37 obtained by cryoelectron microscopy. The reconstruction reveals a RAF1 kinase with an unfolded N-lobe separated from its C-lobe. The hydrophobic core of the N-lobe is trapped in the HSP90 dimer, while CDC37 wraps around the chaperone and interacts with the N- and C-lobes of the kinase. The structure indicates how CDC37 can discriminate between the different members of the RAF family. Our structural analysis also reveals that the folded RAF1 assembles with 14-3-3 dimers, suggesting that after folding RAF1 follows a similar activation as B-RAF. Finally, disruption of the interaction between CDC37 and the DFG segment of RAF1 unveils potential vulnerabilities in attempting the pharmacological degradation of RAF1 for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Distributions of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) were examined in the human minor salivary glands. ChAT-, VIP- and DBH-immunoreactive (-IR) nerve fibers were detected within nerve bundles and close to blood vessels and ducts in the salivary glands. Periacinar nerve fibers were commonly immunoreactive for ChAT in the Ebner’s gland but infrequently in other salivary glands. Periacinar VIP-IR nerve fibers were numerous in the palatal gland, moderate in the lingual gland and relatively rare in the labial and Ebner’s glands. Some TH-, NPY- and TRPV2-IR nerve fibers were also present around blood vessels and glandular acini in the palatal, lingual and Ebner’s glands. Neuronal cells in the vicinity of Ebner’s and lingual glands were immunoreactive for ChAT, VIP, TH and TRPV2. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, VIP- and ChAT-IR varicosities were located in the vicinity of myoepithelial and acinar cells in the minor salivary glands. The human minor salivary glands are probably innervated by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Neurotransmitters including neuropeptides in these nerves are thought to be correlated to vasodilation and/or salivary secretion. Acetylcholine and VIP may regulate secretion of the saliva and its components in the salivary glands.

Abstract: Summary
The covalent conjugation of ubiquitin family proteins is a widespread post-translational protein modification. In the ubiquitin family, the ATG8 subfamily is exceptional because it is conjugated mainly to phospholipids. However, it remains unknown whether other ubiquitin family proteins are also conjugated to phospholipids. Here, we report that ubiquitin is conjugated to phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in yeast and mammalian cells. Ubiquitinated PE (Ub-PE) accumulates at endosomes and the vacuole (or lysosomes), and its level increases during starvation. Ub-PE is also found in baculoviruses. In yeast, PE ubiquitination is catalyzed by the canonical ubiquitin system enzymes Uba1 (E1), Ubc4/5 (E2), and Tul1 (E3) and is reversed by Doa4. Liposomes containing Ub-PE recruit the ESCRT components Vps27-Hse1 and Vps23 in vitro. Ubiquitin-like NEDD8 and ISG15 are also conjugated to phospholipids. These findings suggest that the conjugation to membrane phospholipids is not specific to ATG8 but is a general feature of the ubiquitin family.

Abstract: Summary
Despite essentially symmetric structures in mammalian brains, the left and right hemispheres do not contribute equally to certain cognitive functions. How both hemispheres interact to cause this asymmetry remains unclear. Here, we study this question in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing five versions of a tactile-based decision-making task with a short-term memory (STM) component. Unilateral inhibition of ALM produces variable behavioral deficits across tasks, with the left, right, or both ALMs playing critical roles in STM. Neural activity and its encoding capability are similar across hemispheres, despite that only one hemisphere dominates in behavior. Inhibition of the dominant ALM disrupts encoding capability in the non-dominant ALM, but not vice versa. Variable behavioral deficits are predicted by the influence on contralateral activity across sessions, mice, and tasks. Together, these results reveal that the left and right ALM interact asymmetrically, leading to their differential contributions to STM.

Abstract: Summary
The AAA+ protein, Skd3 (human CLPB), solubilizes proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which is critical for human health. Skd3 variants with defective protein-disaggregase activity cause severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 7 (MGCA7). How Skd3 disaggregates proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we report a high-resolution structure of a Skd3-substrate complex. Skd3 adopts a spiral hexameric arrangement that engages substrate via pore-loop interactions in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Substrate-bound Skd3 hexamers stack head-to-head via unique, adaptable ankyrin-repeat domain (ANK)-mediated interactions to form dodecamers. Deleting the ANK linker region reduces dodecamerization and disaggregase activity. We elucidate apomorphic features of the Skd3 NBD and C-terminal domain that regulate disaggregase activity. We also define how Skd3 subunits collaborate to disaggregate proteins. Importantly, SCN-linked subunits sharply inhibit disaggregase activity, whereas MGCA7-linked subunits do not. These advances illuminate Skd3 structure and mechanism, explain SCN and MGCA7 inheritance patterns, and suggest therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulatory type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) engage in productive interactions with CD8+ effectors along tumor-stroma boundaries. The paradoxical accumulation of “poised” cDC1s within stromal sheets is unlikely to simply reflect passive exclusion from tumor cores. Drawing parallels with embryonic morphogenesis, we hypothesized that invasive margin stromal remodeling generates developmentally conserved cell fate cues that regulate cDC1 behavior. We find that, in human T cell-inflamed tumors, CD8+ T cells penetrate tumor nests, whereas cDC1s are confined within adjacent stroma that recurrently displays site-specific proteolysis of the matrix proteoglycan versican (VCAN), an essential organ-sculpting modification in development. VCAN is necessary, and its proteolytic fragment (matrikine) versikine is sufficient for cDC1 accumulation. Versikine does not influence tumor-seeding pre-DC differentiation; rather, it orchestrates a distinctive cDC1 activation program conferring exquisite sensitivity to DNA sensing, supported by atypical innate lymphoid cells. Thus, peritumoral stroma mimicking embryonic provisional matrix remodeling regulates cDC1 abundance and activity to elicit T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic mRNA technology is a promising avenue for treating and preventing disease. Key to the technology is the incorporation of modified nucleotides such as N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) to decrease immunogenicity of the RNA. However, relatively few studies have addressed the effects of modified nucleotides on the decoding process. Here, we investigate the effect of m1Ψ and the related modification pseudouridine (Ψ) on translation. In a reconstituted system, we find that m1Ψ does not significantly alter decoding accuracy. More importantly, we do not detect an increase in miscoded peptides when mRNA containing m1Ψ is translated in cell culture, compared with unmodified mRNA. We also find that m1Ψ does not stabilize mismatched RNA-duplex formation and only marginally promotes errors during reverse transcription. Overall, our results suggest that m1Ψ does not significantly impact translational fidelity, a welcome sign for future RNA therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling is localized to multiple spatially distinct microdomains, but the role of cAMP microdomains in cancer cell biology is poorly understood. Here, we present a tunable genetic system that allows us to activate cAMP signaling in specific microdomains. We uncover a nuclear cAMP microdomain that activates a tumor-suppressive pathway in a broad range of cancers by inhibiting YAP, a key effector protein of the Hippo pathway, inside the nucleus. We show that nuclear cAMP induces a LATS-dependent pathway leading to phosphorylation of nuclear YAP solely at serine 397 and export of YAP from the nucleus with no change in YAP protein stability. Thus, nuclear cAMP inhibition of nuclear YAP is distinct from other known mechanisms of Hippo regulation. Pharmacologic targeting of specific cAMP microdomains remains an untapped therapeutic approach for cancer; thus, drugs directed at the nuclear cAMP microdomain may provide avenues for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Myxosporeans are a diverse group of microscopic cnidarians of wide distribution that evolved into a parasitic lifestyle. A new myxosporean species, Myxobolus sp., is herein described infecting the mandible of wild specimens of Synbranchus marmoratus, caught in the world's largest tropical wetland area, Pantanal, Brazil. Light, scanning, transmission electron microscopy and histological observations unveiled detailed taxonomic information of the new myxosporean cnidarian. Ultrastructural analysis revealed a detailed description of plasmodia structures which can be used for comparison with plasmodia from other species of myxobolids. Both histological and ultrastructural observations evidenced a connective tissue capsule surrounding the plasmodia of Myxobolus sp. as a histopathological host reaction to the infection of this parasitic cnidarian. Histology showed that tissue tropism of the new myxosporean occurs in a well-defined part of the mandible, with development of plasmodia occurring in the epidermis layer. Mature myxospores from the valvular view featured an ovoid shape and had a short prolongation of the spore valves in the posterior end. Myxospores measured 22.7 ± 1.2 µm (21.5–23.9 µm) in length, 12.5 ± 0.4 µm (12.1–12.9 µm) in width and 11.3 ± 0.5 (10.8–11.8 µm) in thickness. Polar capsules were pyriform equally-sized and measuring 4.6 ± 0.3 µm (3.9–4.3 µm) in length and 2.9 ± 0.1 µm in width (2.8–3.0 µm). Finally, this study substantiates the still hidden myxosporean diversity from South America.

Abstract: Summary
Gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are thought to calibrate glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) bioavailability, thereby regulating systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we show that the gut IEL GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is not required for enteroendocrine L cell GLP-1 secretion and glucose homeostasis nor for the metabolic benefits of GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1RAs). Instead, the gut IEL GLP-1R is essential for the full effects of GLP-1RAs on gut microbiota. Moreover, independent of glucose control or weight loss, the anti-inflammatory actions of GLP-1RAs require the gut IEL GLP-1R to selectively restrain local and systemic T cell-induced, but not lipopolysaccharide-induced, inflammation. Such effects are mediated by the suppression of gut IEL effector functions linked to the dampening of proximal T cell receptor signaling in a protein-kinase-A-dependent manner. These data reposition key roles of the L cell-gut IEL GLP-1R axis, revealing mechanisms linking GLP-1R activation in gut IELs to modulation of microbiota composition and control of intestinal and systemic inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA modification, affects multiple steps in gene expression. Mechanistically, the binding of YTHDF2 to m6A on mRNAs elicits rapid mRNA degradation by recruiting several RNA degrading enzymes. Here, we show that N1-methyladenosine (m1A), another type of RNA modification, accelerates rapid m6A RNA degradation. We identify HRSP12 as an RNA-binding protein that recognizes m1A. The binding of HRSP12 to m1A promotes efficient interaction of YTHDF2 with m6A, consequently facilitating endoribonucleolytic cleavage via the RNase P/MRP complex. Transcriptome-wide analyses also reveal that mRNAs harboring both m1A and m6A are downregulated in an HRSP12-dependent manner compared with mRNAs harboring m6A only. Accordingly, a subset of endogenous circular RNAs that harbor m6A and associate with YTHDF2 in an HRSP12-dependent manner is also subjected to m1A-facilitated rapid degradation. Together, our observations provide compelling evidence for crosstalk between different RNA modifications.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subverts host epigenetic pathways to switch between viral latency programs, colonize the B cell compartment, and reactivate. Within memory B cells, the reservoir for lifelong infection, EBV genomic DNA and histone methylation marks restrict gene expression. But this epigenetic strategy also enables EBV-infected tumors, including Burkitt lymphomas, to evade immune detection. Little is known about host cell metabolic pathways that support EBV epigenome landscapes. We therefore used amino acid restriction, metabolomic, and CRISPR approaches to identify that an abundant methionine supply and interconnecting methionine and folate cycles maintain Burkitt EBV gene silencing. Methionine restriction, or methionine cycle perturbation, hypomethylated EBV genomes and de-repressed latent membrane protein and lytic gene expression. Methionine metabolism also shaped EBV latency gene regulation required for B cell immortalization. Dietary methionine restriction altered murine Burkitt xenograft metabolomes and de-repressed EBV immunogens in vivo. These results highlight epigenetic/immunometabolism crosstalk supporting the EBV B cell life cycle and suggest therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
RAD51 and the breast cancer suppressor BRCA2 have critical functions in DNA double-strand (dsDNA) break repair by homologous recombination and the protection of newly replicated DNA from nucleolytic degradation. The recombination function of RAD51 requires its binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), whereas binding to dsDNA is inhibitory. Using reconstituted MRE11-, EXO1-, and DNA2-dependent nuclease reactions, we show that the protective function of RAD51 unexpectedly depends on its binding to dsDNA. The BRC4 repeat of BRCA2 abrogates RAD51 binding to dsDNA and accordingly impairs the function of RAD51 in protection. The BRCA2 C-terminal RAD51-binding segment (TR2) acts in a dominant manner to overcome the effect of BRC4. Mechanistically, TR2 stabilizes RAD51 binding to dsDNA, even in the presence of BRC4, promoting DNA protection. Our data suggest that RAD51’s dsDNA-binding capacity may have evolved together with its function in replication fork protection and provide a mechanistic basis for the DNA-protection function of BRCA2.

Abstract: The plasma membrane (NCX) and mitochondrial (NCLX) Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are structurally related proteins, although they operate under strictly different ionic conditions and membrane potentials. In contrast with NCX, NCLX can transport either Li+ or Na+ in exchange for Ca2+. Whereas the crystal structure of the archaeal NCX (NCX_Mj) describes the binding sites for alternative binding of 3Na+ or 1Ca2+, these features remain elusive for NCLX due to the lack of structural information. To elucidate the ion-binding features of mitochondrial NCLX, we analyzed here the Li+-transporting NCLX_Mj mutant, produced by replacing the ion-coordinating residues in the archaeal NCX (NCX_Mj) to match the ion-coordinating residues of human NCLX. The NCLX_Mj-mediated Na+/Ca2+ or Li+/Ca2+ exchange rates are insensitive to varying voltage, consistent with an electroneutral ion exchange. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that NCLX_Mj contains two novel Li+ binding sites with four ion-coordinating residues, derived from the three Na+ binding sites of NCX_Mj. The ion-coordination modes, observed in the MD simulations, were further supported by two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy and by testing the mutational effects on the ion fluxes. Collectively, our results revealed a structural basis for Li+ binding and electroneutral transport (2Na+/Li+:1Ca2+) by NCLX_Mj, meaning that the NCLX-mediated electroneutral transport may predefine mitochondrial Ca2+ and Na+ signaling to modulate cellular functions.

Abstract: Summary
The interaction of RB with chromatin is key to understanding its molecular functions. Here, for first time, we identify the full spectrum of chromatin-bound RB. Rather than exclusively binding promoters, as is often described, RB targets three fundamentally different types of loci (promoters, enhancers, and insulators), which are largely distinguishable by the mutually exclusive presence of E2F1, c-Jun, and CTCF. While E2F/DP facilitates RB association with promoters, AP-1 recruits RB to enhancers. Although phosphorylation in CDK sites is often portrayed as releasing RB from chromatin, we show that the cell cycle redistributes RB so that it enriches at promoters in G1 and at non-promoter sites in cycling cells. RB-bound promoters include the classic E2F-targets and are similar between lineages, but RB-bound enhancers associate with different categories of genes and vary between cell types. Thus, RB has a well-preserved role controlling E2F in G1, and it targets cell-type-specific enhancers and CTCF sites when cells enter S-phase.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its crucial role in initiation of cytotoxic immune responses, the molecular pathways underlying antigen cross-presentation remain incompletely understood. The mechanism of antigen exit from endocytic compartments into the cytosol is a long-standing matter of controversy, confronting two main models: transfer through specific channels/transporters or rupture of endocytic membranes and leakage of luminal content. By monitoring the occurrence of intracellular damage in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), we show that cross-presenting cDC1s display more frequent endomembrane injuries and increased recruitment of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, the main repair system for intracellular membranes, relative to cDC2s. Silencing of CHMP2a or CHMP4b, two effector subunits of ESCRT-III, enhances cytosolic antigen export and cross-presentation. This phenotype is partially reversed by chemical inhibition of RIPK3, suggesting that endocytic damage is related to basal activation of the necroptosis pathway. Membrane repair therefore proves crucial in containing antigen export to the cytosol and cross-presentation in cDCs.

Abstract: Summary
How environmental nutrient availability impacts T cell metabolism and function remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the presence of physiologic carbon sources (PCSs) in cell culture medium broadly impacts glucose utilization by CD8+ T cells, independent of transcriptional changes in metabolic reprogramming. The presence of PCSs reduced glucose contribution to the TCA cycle and increased effector function of CD8+ T cells, with lactate directly fueling the TCA cycle. In fact, CD8+ T cells responding to Listeria infection preferentially consumed lactate over glucose as a TCA cycle substrate in vitro, with lactate enhancing T cell bioenergetic and biosynthetic capacity. Inhibiting lactate-dependent metabolism in CD8+ T cells by silencing lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) impaired both T cell metabolic homeostasis and proliferative expansion in vivo. Together, our data indicate that carbon source availability shapes T cell glucose metabolism and identifies lactate as a bioenergetic and biosynthetic fuel for CD8+ effector T cells.

Abstract: Summary
More than 40% of patients with late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) develop liver metastasis (LM). Which immune cells play important roles in CRC-LM and contribute to the difference between left-sided CRC (LCC) and right-sided CRC (RCC) remain unclear. By single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we not only find that activated B cells are significantly depleted in CRC with LM, but also find a subtype of B cells developed from activated B cells, namely immature plasma cell population alpha (iMPA), highly correlated with metastasis. Mechanistically, inhibition of the Wnt and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways in cancer cell promotes activated B cell migration via the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis. This study reveals that B cell subpopulations in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) play a key role in CRC-LM as well as in LCC and RCC. The preventive effects of modulating B cell subpopulations in CRC may provide a rationale for subsequent drug development and CRC-LM management.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+/ERBB2) breast cancer often present with brain metastasis. HER2-targeted therapies have not been successful to treat brain metastases in part due to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrance and emergence of resistance. Here, we report that Abelson (ABL) kinase allosteric inhibitors improve overall survival and impair HER2+ brain metastatic outgrowth in vivo. Mechanistically, ABL kinases phosphorylate the RNA-binding protein Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1). ABL kinase inhibition disrupts binding of YB-1 to the ERBB2 mRNA and impairs translation, leading to a profound decrease in HER2 protein levels. ABL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of YB-1 promotes HER2 translation. Notably, loss of YB-1 inhibits brain metastatic outgrowth and impairs expression of a subset of ABL-dependent brain metastatic targets. These data support a role for ABL kinases in the translational regulation of brain metastatic targets through YB-1 and offer a therapeutic target for HER2+ brain metastasis patients.

Abstract: A long-term energy nutritional imbalance fundamentally causes the development of obesity and associated fat accumulation. Lysosomes, as nutrient-sensing and lipophagy centers, critically control cellular lipid catabolism in response to nutrient deprivation. However, whether lysosome activity is directly involved in nutrient-induced fat accumulation remains unclear. In this study, worm fat accumulation was induced by 1 mM glucose or 0.02 mM palmitic acid supplementation. Along with the elevation of fat accumulation, lysosomal number and acidification were also increased, suggesting that lysosome activity might be correlated with nutrient-induced fat deposition in Caenorhabditis elegans. Furthermore, treatments with the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine and leupeptin significantly reduced basal and nutrient-induced fat accumulation in C. elegans. The knockdown of hlh-30, which is a critical gene in lysosomal biogenesis, also resulted in worm fat loss. Finally, the mutation of aak-2, daf-15, and rsks-1 showed that mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1) signaling mediated the effects of lysosomes on basal and nutrient-induced fat accumulation in C. elegans. Overall, this study reveals the previously undescribed role of lysosomes in overnutrition sensing, suggesting a new strategy for controlling body fat accumulation.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that emerges with the destruction of beta cells of pancreatic Langerhans islets. Three different therapeutical approaches have been developed so far; pancreas transplantation, islet transplantation, and cell-based therapies. Bioengineering cell sheets for tissue generating is one of the latest approaches that have been used to construct cell-sheets instead of single cells so that it mimics the in vivo environments more. In this study, extra-hepatic functional islet tissue was constructed by transferring the 3-D beta cells and GFP labelled MSCs MSC sheets to the subcutaneous site of rats with STZ-induced diabetes. rBM-MSCs and beta cells were cultured on the 6-well PIPAAm culture dishes. Obtained rBM-MSCs as two-cell sheets and beta cells cultured in droplets with matrigel has transplanted into the dorsal subcutaneous area of diabetic rats. Fasting blood glucose levels and body weights were evaluated for 30 days after transplantation. Immunocytochemistry analysis for the anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenetic effects of MSCs on the 30th day of subcutaneous cell transplantation. All recipient rats transplanted with beta-cells with MSCs returned toward normoglycemia by day 5 and remained at this level for 30 days. Immunocytochemical analyses supported that the MSCs and beta cells preserved their viability and function. MSCs secrete cytokines and growth factors TGF-β and IL-6; MSCs of the important features of the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties, thanks to apoptosis of beta cells preserve graft explained by inhibition. In transplantation of MSCs induced angiogenesis and neovascularization, PECAM-1 and GFP positive simultaneously determining endothelial cells was observed indicating. Subcutaneous 3D beta-cell transplantation would be possible with the MSC-sheets as a feeder layer of beta cells. The beta-cell line is glucose-sensitive and has a high insulin release potential, and can be used as an alternative to islets in in vivo transplant studies.

Abstract: Summary
Proliferating cells exhibit a metabolic phenotype known as “aerobic glycolysis,” which is characterized by an elevated rate of glucose fermentation to lactate irrespective of oxygen availability. Although several theories have been proposed, a rationalization for why proliferating cells seemingly waste glucose carbon by excreting it as lactate remains elusive. Using the NCI-60 cell lines, we determined that lactate excretion is strongly correlated with the activity of mitochondrial NADH shuttles, but not proliferation. Quantifying the fluxes of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS), and lactate dehydrogenase under various conditions demonstrated that proliferating cells primarily transform glucose to lactate when glycolysis outpaces the mitochondrial NADH shuttles. Increasing mitochondrial NADH shuttle fluxes decreased glucose fermentation but did not reduce the proliferation rate. Our results reveal that glucose fermentation, a hallmark of cancer, is a secondary consequence of MAS and G3PS saturation rather than a unique metabolic driver of cellular proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can revolutionize cancer medicine. However, overactivation, lack of tumor-specific surface markers, and antigen escape have hampered CAR T cell development. A multi-antigen targeting CAR system regulated by clinically approved pharmaceutical agents is needed. Here, we present VIPER CARs (versatile protease regulatable CARs), a collection of inducible ON and OFF switch CAR circuits engineered with a viral protease domain. We established their controllability using FDA-approved antiviral protease inhibitors in a xenograft tumor and a cytokine release syndrome mouse model. Furthermore, we benchmarked VIPER CARs against other drug-gated systems and demonstrated best-in-class performance. We showed their orthogonality in vivo using the ON VIPER CAR and OFF lenalidomide-CAR systems. Finally, we engineered several VIPER CAR circuits by combining various CAR technologies. Our multiplexed, drug-gated CAR circuits represent the next progression in CAR design capable of advanced logic and regulation for enhancing the safety of CAR T cell therapy.

Abstract: Macrophages have been reported to play important roles in tissue repair and regeneration. While it is known that macrophages are present in the dental pulp, their role in dental pulp regeneration is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of different phenotype macrophages conditioned medium on the cellular behaviors of hDPSCs and their extracellular matrix (cell sheets) in vitro. Moreover, twenty-four root fragments inserted with cell sheets cultured with different conditioned media were placed into the back subcutaneous space of 6–8-week-old male BALB/c nude mouse. The regenerated tissues in the root fragments were assessed via histologic analysis after 8 weeks of transplantation. M2 macrophages could promote the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. Dental pulp-like tissue with an odontoblast-like layer lining the dentinal surface and well-arranged collagen fibers was harvested in root fragment combined with M2 conditioned medium cultured cell sheet, whereas a large amount of calcium salt deposition and disorganization of collagen fibers were observed in root fragments combined with M1 conditioned medium cultured cell sheet. Therefore, promoting the transformation of M1 into M2 macrophage in dental pulp tissue regeneration may be a potential way for dental pulp regeneration via functional healing.

Abstract: Summary
The Golgi complex is the central sorting station of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Traffic through the Golgi requires activation of Arf guanosine triphosphatases that orchestrate cargo sorting and vesicle formation by recruiting an array of effector proteins. Arf activation and Golgi membrane association is controlled by large guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) possessing multiple conserved regulatory domains. Here we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of full-length Gea2, the yeast paralog of the human Arf-GEF GBF1, that reveal the organization of these regulatory domains and explain how Gea2 binds to the Golgi membrane surface. We find that the GEF domain adopts two different conformations compatible with different stages of the Arf activation reaction. The structure of a Gea2-Arf1 activation intermediate suggests that the movement of the GEF domain primes Arf1 for membrane insertion upon guanosine triphosphate binding. We propose that conformational switching of Gea2 during the nucleotide exchange reaction promotes membrane insertion of Arf1.

Abstract: Summary
The basal ganglia operate largely in closed parallel loops, including an associative circuit for goal-directed behavior originating from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and a somatosensory circuit important for habit formation originating from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). An exception to this parallel circuit organization has been proposed to explain how information might be transferred between striatal subregions, for example, from the DMS to the DLS during habit formation. The “ascending spiral hypothesis” proposes that the DMS disinhibits dopamine signaling in the DLS through a tri-synaptic, open-loop striatonigrostriatal circuit. Here, we use transsynaptic and intersectional genetic tools to investigate both closed- and open-loop striatonigrostriatal circuits. We find strong evidence for closed loops, which would allow striatal subregions to regulate their own dopamine release. We also find evidence for functional synapses in open loops. However, these synapses are unable to modulate tonic dopamine neuron firing, questioning the prominence of their role in mediating crosstalk between striatal subregions.

Abstract: Summary
Membraneless biomolecular condensates (BMCs) contribute to the replication of a growing number of viruses but remain to be functionally characterized. Previously, we demonstrated that pan-retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) proteins phase separated into condensates regulating virus assembly. Here we discover that intrinsically disordered human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) core proteins condense with the viral genomic RNA (vRNA) to assemble as BMCs attaining a geometry characteristic of viral reverse transcription complexes. We explore the predisposition, mechanisms, and pharmacologic sensitivity of HIV-1 core BMCs in living cells. HIV-1 vRNA-interacting NC condensates were found to be scaffolds onto which client capsid, reverse transcriptase, and integrase condensates assemble. HIV-1 core BMCs exhibit fundamental characteristics of BMCs and are drug-sensitive. Lastly, protease-mediated maturation of Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins yield abundant and visible BMCs in cells. This study redefines HIV-1 core components as fluid BMCs and advances our understanding of the nature of viral cores during ingress.

Abstract: Summary
Current strategies to manage preterm labor center around inhibition of uterine myometrial contractions, yet do not improve neonatal outcomes as they do not address activation of inflammation. Here, we identify that during human labor, activated oxytocin receptor (OTR) reprograms the prostaglandin E2 receptor, EP2, in the pregnant myometrium to suppress relaxatory/Gαs-cAMP signaling and promote pro-labor/inflammatory responses via altered coupling of EP2 from Gαq/11 to Gαi/o. The ability of EP2 to signal via Gαi/o is recapitulated with in vitro OT and only following OTR activation, suggesting direct EP2-OTR crosstalk. Super-resolution imaging with computational modeling reveals OT-dependent reorganization of EP2-OTR complexes to favor conformations for Gαi over Gαs activation. A selective EP2 ligand, PGN9856i, activates the relaxatory/Gαs-cAMP pathway but not the pro-labor/inflammatory responses in term-pregnant myometrium, even following OT. Our study reveals a mechanism, and provides a potential therapeutic solution, whereby EP2-OTR functional associations could be exploited to delay preterm labor.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence and global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, which carry an unprecedented number of mutations, raise serious concerns due to the reduced efficacy of current vaccines and resistance to therapeutic antibodies. Here, we report the generation and characterization of two potent human monoclonal antibodies, NA8 and NE12, against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. NA8 interacts with a highly conserved region and has a breadth of neutralization with picomolar potency against the Beta variant and the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages and nanomolar potency against BA.2.12.1 and BA.4. Combination of NA8 and NE12 retains potent neutralizing activity against the major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Cryo-EM analysis provides the structural basis for the broad and complementary neutralizing activity of these two antibodies. We confirm the in vivo protective and therapeutic efficacies of NA8 and NE12 in the hamster model. These results show that broad and potent human antibodies can overcome the continuous immune escape of evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary protein restriction (PR) has rapid effects on metabolism including improved glucose and lipid homeostasis, via multiple mechanisms. Here, we investigate responses of fecal microbiome, hepatic transcriptome, and hepatic metabolome to six diets with protein from 18% to 0% of energy in mice. PR alters fecal microbial composition, but metabolic effects are not transferable via fecal transplantation. Hepatic transcriptome and metabolome are significantly altered in diets with lower than 10% energy from protein. Changes upon PR correlate with calorie restriction but with a larger magnitude and specific changes in amino acid (AA) metabolism. PR increases steady-state aspartate, serine, and glutamate and decreases glucose and gluconeogenic intermediates. 13C6 glucose and glycerol tracing reveal increased fractional enrichment in aspartate, serine, and glutamate. Changes remain intact in hepatic ATF4 knockout mice. Together, this demonstrates an ATF4-independent shift in gluconeogenic substrate utilization toward specific AAs, with compensation from glycerol to promote a protein-sparing response.

Abstract: Summary
TRPV4 channel activation in endothelial cells leads to vasodilation, while impairment of TRPV4 activity is implicated in vascular dysfunction. Strategies that increase TRPV4 activity could enhance vasodilation and ameliorate vascular disorders. Here, we show that supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid known to have beneficial cardiovascular effects, increases TRPV4 activity in human endothelial cells of various vascular beds. Mice carrying the C. elegans FAT-1 enzyme, which converts ω-6 to ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, display higher EPA content and increased TRPV4-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric arteries. Likewise, mice fed an EPA-enriched diet exhibit enhanced and prolonged TRPV4-dependent vasodilation in an endothelial cell-specific manner. We also show that EPA supplementation reduces TRPV4 desensitization, which contributes to the prolonged vasodilation. Neutralization of positive charges in the TRPV4 N terminus impairs the effect of EPA on channel desensitization. These findings highlight the beneficial effects of manipulating fatty acid content to enhance TRPV4-mediated vasodilation.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol deficiency triggers SCAP-mediated SREBP activation, whereas hypernutrition together with ER stress activates SREBP1/2 via caspase-2. Whether these pathways interact and how they are selectively activated by different dietary cues are unknown. Here, we reveal regulatory crosstalk between the two pathways that controls the transition from hepatosteatosis to steatohepatitis. Hepatic ER stress elicited by NASH-inducing diets activates IRE1 and induces expression of the PIDDosome subunits caspase-2, RAIDD, and PIDD1, along with INSIG2, an inhibitor of SCAP-dependent SREBP activation. PIDDosome assembly activates caspase-2 and sustains IRE1 activation. PIDDosome ablation or IRE1 inhibition blunt steatohepatitis and diminish INSIG2 expression. Conversely, while inhibiting simple steatosis, SCAP ablation amplifies IRE1 and PIDDosome activation and liver damage in NASH-diet-fed animals, effects linked to ER disruption and preventable by IRE1 inhibition. Thus, the PIDDosome and SCAP pathways antagonistically modulate nutrient-induced hepatic ER stress to control non-linear transition from simple steatosis to hepatitis, a key step in NASH pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Shigella infection is the second leading cause of death due to diarrheal disease in young children worldwide. With the rise of antibiotic resistance, initiatives to design and deploy a safe and effective Shigella vaccine are urgently needed. However, efforts to date have been hindered by the limited understanding of immunological correlates of protection against shigellosis. We applied systems serology to perform a comprehensive analysis of Shigella-specific antibody responses in sera obtained from volunteers before and after experimental infection with S. flexneri 2a in a series of controlled human challenge studies. Polysaccharide-specific antibody responses are infrequent prior to infection and evolve concomitantly with disease severity. In contrast, pre-existing antibody responses to type 3 secretion system proteins, particularly IpaB, consistently associate with clinical protection from disease. Linked to particular Fc-receptor binding patterns, IpaB-specific antibodies leverage neutrophils and monocytes, and complement and strongly associate with protective immunity. IpaB antibody-mediated functions improve with a subsequent rechallenge resulting in complete clinical protection. Collectively, our systems serological analyses indicate protein-specific functional correlates of immunity against Shigella in humans.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, despite medical and technological advancements. The RhoBTB family consists of three isoforms: RhoBTB1, RhoBTB2, and RhoBTB3. RhoBTB1 and RhoBTB2 have been proposed as tumor suppressors in breast cancer. However, the roles of RhoBTB3 proteins are unknown in breast cancer. Bioinformatics analysis, including Oncomine, cBioportal, was used to evaluate the potential functions and prognostic values of RhoBTB3 and Col1a1 in breast cancer. qRT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting assay were performed to investigate relevant expression. Functional experiments including proliferation assay, invasion assay, and flow cytometry assay were conducted to determine the role of RhoBTB3 and Col1a1 in breast cancer cells. RhoBTB3 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues as compared to in adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, RhoBTB3 expression was found to be associated with Col1a1 expression. Decreasing RhoBTB3 expression may lead to decreases in the proliferative and invasive properties of breast cancer cells. Further, Col1a1 knockdown in breast cancer cells limited the proliferative and invasive ability of cancer cells. Knockdown of RhoBTB3 may exert inhibit the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of breast cancer cells by repressing the expression of Col1a1, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for treating breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Activating KRAS mutations and functional loss of members of the SWI/SNF complex, including ARID1A, are found together in the primary liver tumor cholangiocarcinoma (CC). How these mutations cooperate to promote CC has not been established. Using murine models of hepatocyte and biliary-specific lineage tracing, we show that Kras and Arid1a mutations drive the formation of CC and tumor precursors from the biliary compartment, which are accelerated by liver inflammation. Using cultured cells, we find that Arid1a loss causes cellular proliferation, escape from cell-cycle control, senescence, and widespread changes in chromatin structure. Notably, we show that the biliary proliferative response elicited by Kras/Arid1a cooperation and tissue injury in CC is caused by failed engagement of the TGF-β-Smad4 tumor suppressor pathway. We thus identify an ARID1A-TGF-β-Smad4 axis as essential in limiting the biliary epithelial response to oncogenic insults, while its loss leads to biliary pre-neoplasia and CC.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction. An animal model mimicking sepsis utilizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin recognized as the most potent bacterial mediator of sepsis. Melatonin (MLT), an effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, is a promising adjunctive drug for sepsis. This study aimed to estimate the potential of MLT in preventing LPS-induced liver damage in Wistar rats by determining the levels of serum and tissue biochemical markers that reflect liver state and function, i.e., serum levels of transaminases and albumin, as well as a panel of oxidative stress-related biomarkers. Additionally, a pathohistological analysis of liver tissue was conducted. Pre-treatment with MLT prevented an LPS-induced increase in serum and tissue liver damage markers and a decrease in the tissue antioxidant capacity, in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems. Micromorphological liver tissue changes mirrored the alterations observed in the biochemical status. In rats with LPS-induced sepsis, melatonin was shown to be a crucial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, with vital roles in the alleviation of oxidative stress, causing an increase of the antioxidant capacities and the improvement of the liver's microscopic appearance.

Abstract: Summary
The drivers of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain incompletely understood. Utilizing directly converted induced neurons (iNs) from AD-patient-derived fibroblasts, we identified a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in AD iNs. Pathological isoform switching of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M (PKM) toward the cancer-associated PKM2 isoform conferred metabolic and transcriptional changes in AD iNs. These alterations occurred via PKM2’s lack of metabolic activity and via nuclear translocation and association with STAT3 and HIF1α to promote neuronal fate loss and vulnerability. Chemical modulation of PKM2 prevented nuclear translocation, restored a mature neuronal metabolism, reversed AD-specific gene expression changes, and re-activated neuronal resilience against cell death.

Abstract: Summary
The high substrate selectivity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system is mediated by a large group of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The ubiquitin ligase CHIP regulates the degradation of chaperone-controlled and chaperone-independent proteins. To understand how CHIP mediates substrate selection and processing, we performed a structure-function analysis of CHIP and addressed its physiological role in Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells. The conserved function of CHIP in chaperone-assisted degradation requires dimer formation to mediate proteotoxic stress resistance and to prevent protein aggregation. The CHIP monomer, however, promotes the turnover of the membrane-bound insulin receptor and longevity. The dimer-monomer transition is regulated by CHIP autoubiquitylation and chaperone binding, which provides a feedback loop that controls CHIP activity in response to cellular stress. Because CHIP also binds other E3 ligases, such as Parkin, the molecular switch mechanism described here could be a general concept for the regulation of substrate selectivity and ubiquitylation by combining different E3s.

The mammalian liver comprises heterogeneous cell types within its tissue microenvironment that undergo pathophysiological reprogramming in disease states, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH are at an increased risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular and cellular nature of liver microenvironment remodeling that links NASH to liver carcinogenesis remains obscure. Here, we show that diet-induced NASH is characterized by the induction of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like macrophages and exhaustion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the liver. The adipocyte-derived endocrine factor Neuregulin 4 (NRG4) serves as a hormonal checkpoint that restrains this pathological reprogramming during NASH. NRG4 deficiency exacerbated the induction of tumor-prone liver immune microenvironment and NASH-related HCC, whereas transgenic NRG4 overexpression elicited protective effects in mice. In a therapeutic setting, recombinant NRG4-Fc fusion protein exhibited remarkable potency in suppressing HCC and prolonged survival in the treated mice. These findings pave the way for therapeutic intervention of liver cancer by targeting the NRG4 hormonal checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome-displacing-factors (NDFs) in yeast, similar to pioneer factors in higher eukaryotes, can open closed chromatin and generate nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs). NDRs in yeast are also affected by ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (CRs). However, how NDFs and CRs coordinate in nucleosome invasion and NDR formation is still unclear. Here, we design a high-throughput method to systematically study the interplay between NDFs and CRs. By combining an integrated synthetic oligonucleotide library with DNA methyltransferase-based, single-molecule nucleosome mapping, we measure the impact of CRs on NDRs generated by individual NDFs. We find that CRs are dispensable for nucleosome invasion by NDFs, and they function downstream of NDF binding to modulate the NDR length. A few CRs show high specificity toward certain NDFs; however, in most cases, CRs are recruited in a factor-nonspecific and NDR length-dependent manner. Overall, our study provides a framework to investigate how NDFs and CRs cooperate to regulate chromatin opening.

Abstract: Summary
The brain propagates neuronal signals accurately and rapidly. Nevertheless, whether and how a pool of cortical neurons transmits an undistorted message to a target remains unclear. We apply optogenetic white noise signals to small assemblies of cortical pyramidal cells (PYRs) in freely moving mice. The directly activated PYRs exhibit a spike timing precision of several milliseconds. Instead of losing precision, interneurons driven via synaptic activation exhibit higher precision with respect to the white noise signal. Compared with directly activated PYRs, postsynaptic interneuron spike trains allow better signal reconstruction, demonstrating error correction. Data-driven modeling shows that nonlinear amplification of coincident spikes can generate error correction and improved precision. Over multiple applications of the same signal, postsynaptic interneuron spiking is most reliable at timescales ten times shorter than those of the presynaptic PYR, exhibiting temporal coding. Similar results are observed in hippocampal region CA1. Coincidence detection of convergent inputs enables messages to be precisely propagated between cortical PYRs and interneurons.

Abstract: Summary
Interferons (IFNs) are essential in antiviral defense, antitumor effects, and immunoregulatory activities. Although methionine oxidation is associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes in plants, animals, and humans, its role in immunity remains unclear. We find that the redox cycling of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is an intrinsic cellular biological process, and that impairment of the redox status contributes to STAT2 methionine oxidation, inhibiting its activation. IFN protects STAT2 from methionine oxidation through the recruitment of methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB2, whose enzymatic activity is enhanced by N-acetyltransferase 9 (NAT9), a chaperone of STAT2 defined in this study, upon IFN treatment. Consequently, loss of Nat9 renders mice more susceptible to viral infection. Our study highlights the key function of methionine oxidation in immunity, which provides evidence for the decline of immune function by aging and may provide insights into the clinical applications of IFN in immune-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) −4, −2, and −1 are involved in transducing signals from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) via the adaptor myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88). How MYD88/IRAK4/2/1 complexes are formed, their redundancies, and potential non-enzymatic roles are subjects of debate. Here, we examine the hierarchical requirements for IRAK proteins in the context of TLR4 activation and confirmed that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is essential for MYD88 signaling. Surprisingly, the IRAK4 scaffold is required for activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) by both MYD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF), a unique adaptation in the TLR4 response. IRAK4 scaffold is, therefore, essential in integrating MYD88 and TRIF in TLR4 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cleavage of one cell into two is the most dramatic event in the life of a cell. Plasma membrane fission occurs within a narrow intercellular bridge (ICB) between the daughter cells, but the mechanisms underlying ICB formation and maturation are poorly understood. Here we identify CIN85 as an ICB assembly factor and demonstrate its requirement for robust and timely cytokinesis. CIN85 interacts directly with the N-terminal region of anillin and SEPT9 and thereby facilitates SEPT9-containing filament localization to the plasma membrane of the ICB. In contrast, the C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of anillin binds to septin units lacking SEPT9 but enriched in SEPT11. Anillin’s interactions with distinct septin units are required to promote ICB elongation and maturation that, we propose, generate the physical space into which the abscission machinery is recruited to drive the final membrane scission event releasing two independent daughter cells.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive stress resistance in microbes is mostly attributed to the expression of stress response genes, including heat-shock proteins. Here, we report a response of E. coli to heat stress caused by degradation of an enzyme in the methionine biosynthesis pathway (MetA). While MetA degradation can inhibit growth, which by itself is detrimental for fitness, we show that it directly benefits survival at temperatures exceeding 50°C, increasing survival chances by more than 1,000-fold. Using both experiments and mathematical modeling, we show quantitatively how protein expression, degradation rates, and environmental stressors cause long-term growth inhibition in otherwise habitable conditions. Because growth inhibition can be abolished with simple mutations, namely point mutations of MetA and protease knockouts, we interpret the breakdown of methionine synthesis as a system that has evolved to halt growth at high temperatures, analogous to “thermal fuses” in engineering that shut off electricity to prevent overheating.

Abstract: Summary
Planar polarity describes the coordinated polarization of cells within a tissue plane, and in animals can be determined by the “core” or Fat-Dachsous pathways. Current models for planar polarity establishment involve two components: tissue-level “global” cues that determine the overall axis of polarity and cell-level feedback-mediated cellular polarity amplification. Here, we investigate the contributions of global cues versus cellular feedback amplification in the core and Fat-Dachsous pathways during Drosophila pupal wing development. We present evidence that these pathways generate planar polarity via distinct mechanisms. Core pathway function is consistent with strong feedback capable of self-organizing cell polarity, which can then be aligned with the tissue axis via weak or transient global cues. Conversely, generation of cell polarity by the Ft-Ds pathway depends on strong global cues in the form of graded patterns of gene expression, which can then be amplified by weak feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
As our closest living relatives, non-human primates uniquely enable explorations of human health, disease, development, and evolution. Considerable effort has thus been devoted to generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from multiple non-human primate species. Here, we establish improved culture methods for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) iPSCs. Such iPSCs spontaneously differentiate in conventional culture conditions, but can be readily propagated by inhibiting endogenous WNT signaling. As a unique functional test of these iPSCs, we injected them into the pre-implantation embryos of another non-human species, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Ectopic expression of gene BCL2 enhances the survival and proliferation of chimpanzee and pig-tailed macaque iPSCs within the pre-implantation embryo, although the identity and long-term contribution of the transplanted cells warrants further investigation. In summary, we disclose transcriptomic and proteomic data, cell lines, and cell culture resources that may be broadly enabling for non-human primate iPSCs research.

Abstract: Forty-two healthy adult male rats (Wistar albino, n = 42, 8 weeks old, starting weights 200–250 g) employed in this study were subdivided into six groups randomly with seven rats per group as follows: (i) Control group: received standard diet; (ii) RJ group: received standard diet supplemented with royal jelly; (iii) F50 group: received standard diet supplemented with fluoride (50 mg/kg BW); (iv) F100 group: received standard diet supplemented with fluoride (100 mg/kg BW); (v) F50 +RJ group: received standard diet supplemented with fluoride (50 mg/kg BW) and royal jelly; (iv) F100 +RJ group: received standard diet supplemented with fluoride (100 mg/kg BW) and royal jelly. The study continued for a total of eight weeks. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine the post-translational expression levels of NF-κB, Bax, Bcl-2, TNF-α, Caspase-3 and Caspase-6 proteins in pancreas tissue. The pancreatic tissue was subjected to histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, MDA, GSH and CAT activities were examined by spectrophotometric analyzes. Our findings demonstrate that, compared to the control and RJ groups, Bcl-2 protein expression was augmented and, conversely, Caspase-6, Caspase-3 and Bax protein levels were decreased upon fluoride treatment. A statistically significant increase in TNF-α and NF-κB protein expressions was observed in the groups with fluoride-induced damage compared to the control and RJ groups. The MDA levels were increased in all fluoride-treated rats compared to those in the control and RJ groups, whereas the CAT and GSH activities were reduced in all rats with fluoride- induced damage. Although there was not a great difference between the groups regarding histopathological findings, there was a tendency to decrease in the rate of damage upon royal jelly treatment.

Abstract: Objective
The study aimed to establish whether HIF1α entrains the core clock in chondrocytes and how the HIF1α affects the circadian rhythm.
Methods
We subjected primary chondrocytes to chronic circadian desynchrony (CCD) and subsequently treated with oxygen rhythm and dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). Circadian oscillations were analyzed with a real-time monitoring system of Per2 promoter activity and qPCR. Chondrocytes were assayed core clock genes expression patterns and extracellular matrix metabolism. HIF1α siRNA was used to knock down HIF1α. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter assay were used to validate that Per2 was the target gene of HIF1α. The surgical model of osteoarthritis was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). The chronic jet lag model was established light/dark cycle advance shift. Joint degeneration was measured using histological staining, immunological assays, and micro-CT scanning.
Results
We report that different patterns of clock genes expression between healthy and osteoarthritic cartilage tissues and oxygen rhythms and DMOG reset the molecular clockwork which was dampened after CCD culture in a HIF1α-dependent manner. HIF1α increased the amplitude of oscillation by directly binding to the HRE-like and E-box-like elements located on the Per2 promoter. The rhythmic circadian clock significantly enhanced extracellular matrix production. Our study also demonstrates that DMOG ameliorated the increased OA severity caused by jet lag in the DMM model.
Conclusions
This study shows that circadian clock resetting caused by DMOG is at least partially mediated by the HIF1α through interaction with the Per2 promoter and proposes DMOG as supportive therapy for OA.

Abstract: Summary
HOXB9 is an important transcription factor associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, its degradation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that HOXB9 is a substrate of AMP kinase alpha (AMPKα). AMPK mediates HOXB9 T133 phosphorylation and downregulates the level of HOXB9 in mice and LUAD cells. Mechanistically, phosphorylated HOXB9 promoted E3 ligase Praja2-mediated HOXB9 degradation. Blocking HOXB9 phosphorylation by depleting AMPKα1/2 or employing the HOXB9 T133A mutant promoted tumor cell growth in cell culture and mouse xenografts via upregulation of HOXB9 and KRAS that is herein identified as a target of HOXB9. Clinically, AMPK activation levels in LUAD samples were positively correlated with pHOXB9 levels; higher pHOXB9 levels were associated with better survival of patients with LUAD. We thus present a HOXB9 degradation mechanism and demonstrate an AMPK-HOXB9-KRAS axis linking glucose-level-regulated AMPK activation to HOXB9 stability and KRAS gene expression, ultimately controlling LUAD progression.

Abstract: Summary
Arthropod-borne viruses, including the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), cause acute disease in millions of people and utilize potent mechanisms to antagonize and circumvent innate immune pathways including the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. In response, hosts have evolved antiviral counterdefense strategies that remain incompletely understood. Recent studies have found that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate classical innate immune pathways; how lncRNAs contribute to additional antiviral counterdefenses remains unclear. Using high-throughput genetic screening, we identified a cytoplasmic antiviral lncRNA that we named antiviral lncRNA prohibiting human alphaviruses (ALPHA), which is transcriptionally induced by alphaviruses and functions independently of IFN to inhibit the replication of CHIKV and its closest relative, O’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV), but not other viruses. Furthermore, we showed that ALPHA interacts with CHIKV genomic RNA and restrains viral RNA replication. Together, our findings reveal that ALPHA and potentially other lncRNAs can mediate non-canonical antiviral immune responses against specific viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome machinery is a major proteostasis control system in human cells, actively compensated upon its inhibition. To understand this compensation, we compared global protein landscapes upon the proteasome inhibition with carfilzomib, in normal fibroblasts, cells of multiple myeloma, and cancers of lung, colon, and pancreas. Molecular chaperones, autophagy, and endocytosis-related proteins are the most prominent vulnerabilities in combination with carfilzomib, while targeting of the HSP70 family chaperones HSPA1A/B most specifically sensitizes cancer cells to the proteasome inhibition. This suggests a central role of HSP70 in the suppression of the proteasome downregulation, allowing to identify pathways impinging on HSP70 upon the proteasome inhibition. HSPA1A/B indeed controls proteasome-inhibition-induced autophagy, unfolded protein response, and endocytic flux, and directly chaperones the proteasome machinery. However, it does not control the NRF1/2-driven proteasome subunit transcriptional bounce-back. Consequently, targeting of NRF1 proves effective in decreasing the viability of cancer cells with the inhibited proteasome and HSP70.

Abstract: Summary
The human mitochondrial genome must be replicated and expressed in a timely manner to maintain energy metabolism and supply cells with adequate levels of adenosine triphosphate. Central to this process is the idea that replication primers and gene products both arise via transcription from a single light strand promoter (LSP) such that primer formation can influence gene expression, with no consensus as to how this is regulated. Here, we report the discovery of a second light strand promoter (LSP2) in humans, with features characteristic of a bona fide mitochondrial promoter. We propose that the position of LSP2 on the mitochondrial genome allows replication and gene expression to be orchestrated from two distinct sites, which expands our long-held understanding of mitochondrial gene expression in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Perception of threats is essential for survival. Previous findings suggest that parallel pathways independently relay innate threat signals from different sensory modalities to multiple brain areas, such as the midbrain and hypothalamus, for immediate avoidance. Yet little is known about whether and how multi-sensory innate threat cues are integrated and conveyed from each sensory modality to the amygdala, a critical brain area for threat perception and learning. Here, we report that neurons expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the parvocellular subparafascicular nucleus in the thalamus and external lateral parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem respond to multi-sensory threat cues from various sensory modalities and relay negative valence to the lateral and central amygdala, respectively. Both CGRP populations and their amygdala projections are required for multi-sensory threat perception and aversive memory formation. The identification of unified innate threat pathways may provide insights into developing therapeutic candidates for innate fear-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The brains and minds of our human ancestors remain inaccessible for experimental exploration. Therefore, we reconstructed human cognitive evolution by projecting nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (ω values) in mammalian phylogeny onto the anatomically modern human (AMH) brain. This atlas retraces human neurogenetic selection and allows imputation of ancestral evolution in task-related functional networks (FNs). Adaptive evolution (high ω values) is associated with excitatory neurons and synaptic function. It shifted from FNs for motor control in anthropoid ancestry (60–41 mya) to attention in ancient hominoids (26–19 mya) and hominids (19–7.4 mya). Selection in FNs for language emerged with an early hominin ancestor (7.4–1.7 mya) and was later accompanied by adaptive evolution in FNs for strategic thinking during recent (0.8 mya–present) speciation of AMHs. This pattern mirrors increasingly complex cognitive demands and suggests that co-selection for language alongside strategic thinking may have separated AMHs from their archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal relatives.

Abstract: Summary
Down syndrome (DS), driven by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (HSA21), and fragile X syndrome (FXS), driven by loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP, are two common genetic causes of intellectual disability and autism. Based upon the number of DS-implicated transcripts bound by FMRP, we hypothesize that DS and FXS may share underlying mechanisms. Comparing DS and FXS human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) and glutamatergic neuron models, we identify increased protein expression of select targets and overlapping transcriptional perturbations. Moreover, acute upregulation of endogenous FMRP in DS patient cells using CRISPRa is sufficient to significantly reduce expression levels of candidate proteins and reverse 40% of global transcriptional perturbations. These results pinpoint specific molecular perturbations shared between DS and FXS that can be leveraged as a strategy for target prioritization; they also provide evidence for the functional relevance of previous associations between FMRP targets and disease-implicated genes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria and plastids power complex life. Why some genes and not others are retained in their organelle DNA (oDNA) genomes remains a debated question. Here, we attempt to identify the properties of genes and associated underlying mechanisms that determine oDNA retention. We harness over 15k oDNA sequences and over 300 whole genome sequences across eukaryotes with tools from structural biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and Bayesian model selection. Previously hypothesized features, including the hydrophobicity of a protein product, and less well-known features, including binding energy centrality within a protein complex, predict oDNA retention across eukaryotes, with additional influences of nucleic acid and amino acid biochemistry. Notably, the same features predict retention in both organelles, and retention models learned from one organelle type quantitatively predict retention in the other, supporting the universality of these features—which also distinguish gene profiles in more recent, independent endosymbiotic relationships. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular profiling studies have enabled discoveries for metastatic prostate cancer (MPC) but have predominantly occurred in academic medical institutions and involved non-representative patient populations. We established the Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project (MPCproject, mpcproject.org), a patient-partnered initiative to involve patients with MPC living anywhere in the US and Canada in molecular research. Here, we present results from our partnership with the first 706 MPCproject participants. While 41% of patient partners live in rural, physician-shortage, or medically underserved areas, the MPCproject has not yet achieved racial diversity, a disparity that demands new initiatives detailed herein. Among molecular data from 333 patient partners (572 samples), exome sequencing of 63 tumor and 19 cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples recapitulated known findings in MPC, while inexpensive ultra-low-coverage sequencing of 318 cfDNA samples revealed clinically relevant AR amplifications. This study illustrates the power of a growing, longitudinal partnership with patients to generate a more representative understanding of MPC.

Abstract: Summary
Compelling evidence indicates that in Huntington’s disease (HD), mutation of huntingtin (HTT) alters several aspects of early brain development such as synaptogenesis. It is not clear to what extent the partial loss of wild-type HTT function contributes to these abnormalities. Here we investigate the function of HTT in the formation of spines. Although larger spines normally correlate with more synaptic activity, cell-autonomous depletion of HTT leads to enlarged spines but reduced excitatory synaptic function. We find that HTT is required for the proper turnover of endogenous actin and to recruit AMPA receptors at active synapses; loss of HTT leads to LIM kinase (LIMK) hyperactivation, which maintains cofilin in its inactive state. HTT therefore influences actin dynamics through the LIMK-cofilin pathway. Loss of HTT uncouples spine structure from synaptic function, which may contribute to the ultimate development of HD symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii possesses sphingolipid synthesis capabilities and is equipped to salvage lipids from its host. The contribution of these two routes of lipid acquisition during parasite development is unclear. As part of a complete ceramide synthesis pathway, T. gondii expresses two serine palmitoyltransferases (TgSPT1 and TgSPT2) and a dihydroceramide desaturase. After deletion of these genes, we determine their role in parasite development in vitro and in vivo during acute and chronic infection. Detailed phenotyping through lipidomic approaches reveal a perturbed sphingolipidome in these mutants, characterized by a drastic reduction in ceramides and ceramide phosphoethanolamines but not sphingomyelins. Critically, parasites lacking TgSPT1 display decreased fitness, marked by reduced growth rates and a selective defect in rhoptry discharge in the form of secretory vesicles, causing an invasion defect. Disruption of de novo ceramide synthesis modestly affects acute infection in vivo but severely reduces cyst burden in the brain of chronically infected mice.

Abstract: Summary
Many scenarios in cellular communication require cells to interpret multiple dynamic signals. It is unclear how exposure to inflammatory stimuli alters transcriptional responses to subsequent stimulus. Using high-throughput microfluidic live-cell analysis, we systematically profile the NF-κB response to different signal sequences in single cells. We find that NF-κB dynamics store the short-term history of received signals: depending on the prior pathogenic or cytokine signal, the NF-κB response to subsequent stimuli varies from no response to full activation. Using information theory, we reveal that these stimulus-dependent changes in the NF-κB response encode and reflect information about the identity and dose of the prior stimulus. Small-molecule inhibition, computational modeling, and gene expression profiling show that this encoding is driven by stimulus-dependent engagement of negative feedback modules. These results provide a model for how signal transduction networks process sequences of inflammatory stimuli to coordinate cellular responses in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Background
Metastasis of advanced lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a key cause of cancer-related death, and angiogenesis is the main feature of tumor growth and metastasis.
Methods
The expression level of F2R like trypsin receptor 1(F2RL1) which encodes protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) protein in LUAD tissues was analyzed by bioinformatics. The effects of F2RL1 overexpression/silencing on cell proliferation and sphere-forming were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays, stem cell sphere-forming assay, and angiogenesis assay, respectively. The F2RL1 mRNA expression level and the PAR2 protein expression level, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung cancer cell lines were evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The level of VEGFA secreted by lung cancer cells was analyzed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effect of F2RL1-mediated EGFR signaling on angiogenesis was further explored by EGFR inhibitor AG1478.
Results
F2RL1 was substantially up-regulated in LUAD tissues and cells, and overexpression of F2RL1 could promote proliferation and stem cell sphere-forming of lung cancer cell lines, as well as formation of blood vessels and branch points of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Meanwhile, overexpression of F2RL1 significantly upregulated VEGFA expression and promoted EGFR phosphorylation. EGFR inhibitor AG1478 treatment significantly down-regulated pEGFR, and AG1478 treatment reversed the promoting effect of cancer cell cultured medium (oe-F2RL1) on HUVEC angiogenesis.
Significance
In summary, this study revealed the molecular mechanism of PAR2 promoting LUAD angiogenesis by activating EGFR signaling pathway, which further improves our understanding of LUAD angiogenesis, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for LUAD treatment.

Abstract: Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (Trim25) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates retinoid acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and promotes the antiviral interferon response. Recent studies have shown that Trim25 can bind and degrade viral proteins, suggesting a different mechanism of Trim25 on its antiviral effects. In this study, Trim25 expression was upregulated in cells and mouse brains after rabies virus (RABV) infection. Moreover, expression of Trim25 limited RABV replication in cultured cells. Overexpression of Trim25 caused attenuated viral pathogenicity in a mouse model that was intramuscularly injected with RABV. Further experiments confirmed that Trim25 inhibited RABV replication via two different mechanisms: an E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent mechanism and an E3 ubiquitin ligase-independent mechanism. Specifically, the CCD domain of Trim25 interacted with RABV phosphoprotein (RABV-P) at amino acid (AA) position at 72 and impaired the stability of RABV-P via complete autophagy. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which Trim25 restricts RABV replication by destabilizing RABV-P, which is independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency is a critical problem worldwide. Such deficiency in infants has long been known to increase the propensity to develop obesity and diabetes later in life through unclear mechanisms. Here, we establish a Caenorhabditis elegans model to study how early-life B12 impacts adult health. We find that early-life B12 deficiency causes increased lipogenesis and lipid peroxidation in adult worms, which in turn induces germline defects through ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we show the central role of the methionine cycle-SBP-1/SREBP1-lipogenesis axis in programming adult traits by early-life B12. Moreover, SBP-1/SREBP1 participates in a crucial feedback loop with NHR-114/HNF4 to maintain cellular B12 homeostasis. Inhibition of SBP-1/SREBP1-lipogenesis signaling and ferroptosis later in life can reverse disorders in adulthood when B12 cannot. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into the life-course effects of early-life B12 on the programming of adult health and identifies potential targets for future interventions for adiposity and infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Stopping an inappropriate response requires the involvement of the prefrontal-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway. However, how the prefrontal-striatal indirect pathway contributes to stopping is poorly understood. In this study, transcranial ultrasound stimulation is used to perform interventions in a task-related region in the striatum. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals activation in the right anterior part of the putamen during response inhibition, and ultrasound stimulation to the anterior putamen, as well as the subthalamic nucleus, results in significant impairments in stopping performance. Diffusion imaging further reveals prominent structural connections between the anterior putamen and the right anterior part of the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and ultrasound stimulation to the anterior IFC also shows significant impaired stopping performance. These results demonstrate that the right anterior putamen and right anterior IFC causally contribute to stopping and suggest that the anterior IFC-anterior putamen circuit in the indirect pathway serves as an essential route for stopping.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD) is characterized by defective oligodendroglial differentiation and white matter disease. Here, we investigate the role of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) dysfunction in adult myelin maintenance in HD. We first note a progressive, age-related loss of myelin in both R6/2 and zQ175 HD mice compared with wild-type controls. Adult R6/2 mice then manifest a significant delay in remyelination following cuprizone demyelination. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis of callosal white matter and OPCs isolated from both R6/2 and zQ175 mice reveals a systematic downregulation of genes associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis. Gene co-expression and network analysis predicts repressed Tcf7l2 signaling as a major driver of this expression pattern. In vivo Tcf7l2 overexpression restores both myelin gene expression and remyelination in demyelinated R6/2 mice. These data causally link impaired TCF7L2-dependent transcription to the poor development and homeostatic retention of myelin in HD and provide a mechanism for its therapeutic restoration.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal place cells receive a disparate collection of excitatory and inhibitory currents that endow them with spatially selective discharges and rhythmic activity. Using a combination of in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings with opto/chemogenetic manipulations and computational modeling, we investigate the influence of inhibitory and excitatory inputs on CA1 pyramidal cell responses. At the cell bodies, inhibition leads and is stronger than excitation across the entire theta cycle. Pyramidal neurons fire on the ascending phase of theta when released from inhibition. Computational models equipped with the observed conductances reproduce these dynamics. In these models, place field properties are favored when the increased excitation is coupled with a reduction of inhibition within the field. As predicted by our simulations, firing rate within place fields and phase locking to theta are impaired by DREADDs activation of interneurons. Our results indicate that decreased inhibitory conductance is critical for place field expression.

Abstract: Summary
High altitude exposes humans to hypobaric hypoxia, which induces various physiological and molecular changes. Recent studies point toward interaction between circadian rhythms and the hypoxic response, yet their human relevance is lacking. Here, we examine the effect of different high altitudes in conjunction with time of day on human whole-blood transcriptome upon an expedition to the highest city in the world, La Rinconada, Peru, which is 5,100 m above sea level. We find that high altitude vastly affects the blood transcriptome and, unexpectedly, does not necessarily follow a monotonic response to altitude elevation. Importantly, we observe daily variance in gene expression, especially immune-related genes, which is largely altitude dependent. Moreover, using a digital cytometry approach, we estimate relative changes in abundance of different cell types and find that the response of several immune cell types is time- and altitude dependent. Taken together, our data provide evidence for interaction between the transcriptional response to hypoxia and the time of day in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Preservation of a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within a heterogeneous carcinoma serves as a paradigm to understand how select cells in a tissue maintain their undifferentiated status. In both embryogenesis and cancer, Snail has been correlated with stemness, but the molecular underpinning of this phenomenon remains largely ill-defined. In models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we discovered a non-epithelial-mesenchymal transition function for the transcription factor Snail in maintaining the stemness of epidermal keratinocytes. Snail-expressing cells secrete the matricellular protein Mindin, which functions in an autocrine fashion to activate a Src-STAT3 pathway to reinforce their stem/progenitor phenotype. This pathway is activated by the engagement of Mindin with the leukocyte-specific integrin, CD11b (ITGAM), which is also unexpectedly expressed by epidermal keratinocytes. Interestingly, disruption of this signaling module in human cSCC attenuates tumorigenesis, suggesting that targeting Mindin would be a promising therapeutic approach to hinder cancer recurrence.

Abstract: Purpose
β-elemene has a wide range of anticancer effects and can be used in a variety of cancer types. This study mainly explored its mechanism of action on TNBC cells and provided theoretical basis for the treatment of TNBC.
Methods
Firstly, TNBC cells were treated with different concentrations of β-elemene, and screened out an appropriate concentration for subsequent research. Then, through the bioinformatics website, predicted genes that have a binding relationship with β-elemene. Then, the overexpression vector of the selected gene was transfected into the cell. The effects of β-elemene and its target genes on the proliferation and apoptosis of TNBC cells were detected by CCK-8, Edu assay, and flow cytometry, and the senescence of cells was determined by SA-β-gal experiment. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of apoptosis and aging-related proteins.
Results
β-elemene inhibited TNBC cell viability and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and induces apoptosis and senescence. Through the screening of candidate genes, IGF1 was finally determined to be an effective target gene of β-elemene. The expression level of IGF1 was decreased in cells treated with β-elemene. Overexpression of IGF1 significantly alleviated ability of β-elemene to inhibit cell viability, proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis and senescence. In addition, β-elemene inhibited the expression of IGF1R and Bcl-2, and promoted the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 and senescence-related proteins (p27, p16, p53 and p21), and these effects were reversed by overexpression of IGF1.
Conclusion
β-elemene induced apoptosis and senescence of triple-negative breast cancer cells through IGF1/IGF1R pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Since formation of the first proto-eukaryotes, gene repertoire and genome complexity have significantly increased. Among genetic elements responsible for this increase are tandem repeats. Here we describe a genome-wide analysis of large tandem repeats, called megasatellites, in 58 vertebrate genomes. Two bursts occurred, one after the radiation between Agnatha and Gnathostomata fishes and the second one in therian mammals. Megasatellites are enriched in subtelomeric regions and frequently encoded in genes involved in transcription regulation, intracellular trafficking, and cell membrane metabolism, reminiscent of what is observed in fungus genomes. The presence of many introns within young megasatellites suggests that an exon-intron DNA segment is first duplicated and amplified before accumulation of mutations in intronic parts partially erases the megasatellite in such a way that it becomes detectable only in exons. Our results suggest that megasatellite formation and evolution is a dynamic and still ongoing process in vertebrate genomes.
