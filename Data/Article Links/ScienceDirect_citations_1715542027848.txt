Abstract: Cu2SnS3 thin films were deposited by a facile sol–gel technique followed by annealing. The annealed films were structurally characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystal structure was found to be tetragonal with crystallite sizes of 2.4–3nm. Texture coefficient calculations from the GIXRD revealed the preferential orientation of the film along the (112) plane. The morphological investigations of the films were carried out using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the composition using electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The temperature dependent current, voltage characteristics of the Cu2SnS3/AZnO heterostructure were studied. The logI–logV plot exhibited three regions of different slopes showing linear ohmic behavior and non-linear behavior following the power law. The temperature dependent current voltage characteristics revealed the variation in ideality factor and barrier height with temperature. The Richardson constant was calculated and its deviation from the theoretical value revealed the inhomogeneity of the barrier heights. Transport characteristics were modeled using the thermionic emission model. The Gaussian distribution of barrier heights was applied and from the modified Richardson plot the value of the Richardson constant was found to be 47.18Acm−2K−2.

Abstract: The calculation of the energy spectrum and absorption coefficients of quantum dot nanostructured intermediate band solar cells using the Empiric K·P Hamiltonian method and its agreement with experimental data are summarized. The well established Luttinger Kohn Hamiltonian modified by Pikus and Bir for strained material, such as quantum dot arrays, is presented using a simplified strain field that allows for square band offsets. The energy spectrum and absorption coefficients are calculated with this new Hamiltonian. With the approximations made the energy spectrum results to be exactly the same but the absorption coefficient fits experiments less accurately. The computer time using the latter Hamiltonian is much longer than the former one.

Abstract: Legumes and a few other plant species can establish a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, which enables them to survive in a nitrogen-deficient environment. During the course of nodulation, infection with rhizobia induces the dedifferentiation of host cells to form primordia of a symbiotic organ, the nodule, which prepares plants to accommodate rhizobia in host cells. While these nodulation processes are known to be genetically controlled by both plants and rhizobia, recent advances in studies on two model legumes, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, have provided great insight into the underlying plant-side molecular mechanism. In this chapter, we review such knowledge, with particular emphasis on two key processes of nodulation, nodule development and rhizobial invasion.

Abstract: Auranofin is a gold based drug in clinical use since 1985 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Beyond its antinflammatory properties, auranofin exhibits other attractive biological and pharmacological actions such as a potent in vitro cytotoxicity and relevant antimicrobial and antiparasitic effects that make it amenable for new therapeutic indications. For instance, auranofin is currently tested as an anticancer agent in four independent clinical trials; yet, its mode of action is highly controversial. With the present study, we explore the effects of auranofin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its likely mechanism. Notably, auranofin is reported to induce remarkable yeast growth inhibition. Solid evidence is provided that growth inhibition is the consequence of a direct cytotoxic insult occurring at the mitochondrial level; a profound depression of cell respiration is indeed clearly documented as the main cause of cell death while induction of ROS plays only a secondary role. More in detail, the mitochondrial NADH kinase Pos5 is identified as a primary target for auranofin. The implications of these results are discussed in the frame of current mechanistic knowledge on the cellular effects of auranofin and of its role as a prospective anticancer drug.

Abstract: In this work, a new microencapsulated phase change material, paraffin@ silica (SiO2)/graphene oxide (GO), is prepared by two steps: engulfing paraffin with silica by in situ hydrolysis and poly condensation of tetraethoxysilane and the modification of the SiO2 shell with GO. The paraffin@SiO2/GO composite is composed of spherical capsules with diameters of ~20um. Raman spectrometer analysis verifies the embedding of GO in the SiO2 shell. The melting and freezing temperatures of the composite are very close to those of paraffin. Based on the melting and freezing enthalpy of the composite, the encapsulation ratio of paraffin is calculated to be 50.8% in the paraffin@SiO2 composite and 49.6% in the paraffin@SiO2/GO composite. It is shown that the paraffin@SiO2/GO composite exhibits enhanced thermal stability and excellent thermal reliability. The phase change slurry prepared by dispersing the paraffin@SiO2/GO composite in water shows higher thermal conductivity and heat capacity along with remarkable photo-thermal conversion performance, making it potential for use as the heat transfer fluid in direct absorption solar collectors. The high heat storage capability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performance of the paraffin@SiO2/GO composite enable it to be a potential material to store solar energy in practical applications.

Abstract: Novel conjugated copolymers consisting of bis(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (BDT) and N-alkyl-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI) with thiophene and bithiophene linkages have been synthesized and evaluated in bulk heterojunction solar cell. BDT, BTI and thiophene (or bithiophene) units were incorporated using Stille polymerization to generate poly(5-dodecyl-3-(2-thienyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione-co-4,8-di(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene) (P1, P2 and P3) and poly(5-dodecyl-3-di(thien-2-yl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-c:2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione-co-4,8-di(2-octyldodecyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene) (P4, P5 and P6). The BTI unit, as the electron deficient moeity, and the BDT–thiophene (or bithiophene) unit, as the electron rich moeity, have been applied for the efficient intramolecular charge transfer. The introduction of thiophene or bithiophene unit improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPVs. The best device with P2:PC61BM (1:1) showed a open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 7.36mA/cm2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.63, which yield PCE of 4.17%.

Abstract: Nonmixed planar heterojunction (PHJ) small-molecule organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with 96% internal quantum efficiency (at 595nm) and 4.77% power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been demonstrated. In addition to boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C60 as electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively, PHJ OPVs contain an ultrathin (2nm) buffer layer of bis-(naphthylphenylaminophenyl)fumaronitrile (NPAFN) between the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the donor layer (SubPc). Compared with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) or α-naphthylphenylbiphenyl diamine (NPB) buffer layers, the NPAFN buffer layer blocks the exciton diffusion from the SubPc electron donor layer to the ITO anode more effectively and considerably improves the short circuit current (JSC) from 5.96 (without an NPAFN layer) to 7.70mA/cm2 (with a 4-mm-thick NPAFN layer ). In addition, experimental results indicated that the NPAFN buffer layer reduces the crystallization, or stacking, of the SubPc electron donor, thereby limiting the reverse saturation current and elevating the open circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.01 (without an NPAFN layer) to 1.08V (with a-2-nm thick NPAFN layer). However, series resistance (RS) of the OPV monotonically increases with increasing NPAFN layer thickness. The performance of the OPV is optimized when the NPAFN buffer layer thickness is 2nm. Compared with a SubPc–C60 PHJ OPV without an NPAFN buffer layer, the PCE of a OPV with a buffer layer increases by 22% from 3.96% to 4.77%, with a concurrent increase in JSC (from 5.96 to 7.02mA/cm2) and VOC (from 1.01 to 1.08V). However, a decrease in RS (from 10.21 to 14.95Ωcm2) and in fill factor (from 65% to 63%) is also observed.

Abstract: Silicon is still an interesting material for developing Concentration Photovoltaic (CPV) cells working at low and medium concentration range. In this work we describe modeling, design, fabrication technology and functional characterization of a small-area silicon solar cell suitable for CPV applications up to 200 suns. Two-dimensional (2-D) numerical simulations by a state-of-the-art Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) tool adopting calibrated physical models have been performed for both cell design and deep understanding of its performance. Specifically, the simulations have allowed the development and optimization of front contact grid scheme and design of the cell operating under medium concentration. The cell has been tested by means of a novel indoor concentrator system up to 300 suns and a conversion efficiency higher than 22% has been measured, according to numerical simulations. The dependence of short-circuit current on concentration factor has been observed to be super-linear. An excess of short-circuit current at 300 suns of approximately 8% has been measured. The super-linear effect has been investigated by means of numerical simulations and explained in terms of enhanced carrier diffusion length under concentrated light. The dependence of the super-linear effect on the incoming photon wavelength was also observed and discussed, showing that the super-linearity is due to the spectrum portion above 600nm only.

Abstract: Degradation of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is currently a topic under intense research as it is one of the main limitations towards the commercialization of this technology. Morphological changes at both active layer and interfaces with the outer contacts are believed to determine main key issues to be overcome. In-line techniques are essential to rule out any effect arising during sample fabrication. Unfortunately, the number of physical techniques able to provide morphological information on complete and operational devices is certainly limited. In this work, we study the thermal degradation of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells composed by different donor polymers with techniques developed to provide in-situ information on operational devices. Capacitance measurement as a function of temperature monitors the electrical integrity of the active layer and provides the threshold temperature (TMAX) at which the whole device becomes thermally unstable. We found a direct correlation between the threshold temperature TMAX, obtained by capacitance–temperature measurements on complete OPV devices, and the power conversion efficiency decay measured at 85°C. Devices tend to be thermally stable when the temperature of the thermal stress is below TMAX, while above TMAX evident changes in the active layer or at the active layer/electrode interface are also detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The capacitance method gives precious guidelines to predict the thermal stability of BHJ solar cells using an accelerated and easy test.

Abstract: In this study, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are prepared with an average size of ~15nm by a top down approach using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. The titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OPr)4)/PVP precursor solution is used to get TiO2 NFs by electrospinning technique and then they are decorated with the prepared GQDs. First, the prepared GQDs are confirmed by XRD, Raman, TRPL, DLS, UV–vis, and PL Spectroscopy. The presence of GQDs onto TiO2 NFs is also confirmed by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and EDX studies. The surface morphology and the presence of GQDs onto TiO2 NFs are confirmed by SEM and TEM analysis. The optical properties of GQDs–TiO2 NFs are studied by UV–vis and PL spectroscopy. Finally, the dye sensitized solar cell is fabricated using GQDs decorated TiO2 nanofibers as the photoanode and standard Pt (Dyesol Ltd.) as the counter electrode and 0.5M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.5M LiI, 0.05M I2, 0.5M 4-tertbutylpyridine, in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a photoanode based on GQDs–TiO2 NFs exhibited a high energy conversion efficiency of 6.22%, than the DSSC based on pure TiO2 NFs photoelectrode (4.81%), accompanied by an increment in both short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage. The overall improvement in PCE is ~29.31% for GQDs decorated TiO2 NFs which is higher than other reported systems. The better photogenerated electron transfer ability, reduced charge recombination, increased dye adsorption, and an effective harvesting of visible light, which together added to an improvement in PCE. The stability test is performed for the DSSCs over a period of 30 days (720h) under one sun soaking, where GQDs decorated TiO2 NFs DSSCs is seen to retain ~99% of its initial normalized efficiency, thereby making it a viable option for practical applications.

Abstract: In this work, tunnel SiO2/a-Si:H stacks are trialed as passivated contacts to laser doped p+ and n+ regions. The passivation performance and contact resistivity are investigated as a function of the tunnel SiO2 thickness and annealing condition. We find that the SiO2/a-Si:H stack provides excellent passivation to laser doped n+ regions, with corresponding low recombination current density (Jo) values. A lower level of surface passivation is achieved by the SiO2/a-Si:H stack on laser doped p+ regions. A post-deposition forming gas anneal (FGA) at 400°C is found to improve the passivation performance to laser doped p+ regions and deteriorate the passivation to laser doped n+ regions. Acceptable contact resistivity (ρc) values have been obtained for both laser doped n+ and p+ regions after aluminum metallization and a post FGA to activate the alloying process between the a-Si:H and aluminum layer. In the final part of this work implementation of the passivated contacts to laser doped regions into a simplified interdigitated back-contact (IBC) solar cell fabrication process is proposed. Simulation result suggests that IBC device with an efficiency of up to 23% can be achieved using the obtained experimental results.

Abstract: Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) solar cells are photovoltaic devices designed for high temperature operation. The use of Si, GaAs, and InP as the cathode (i.e. the absorber and the electron-emitter electrode) materials in PETE solar cells is investigated with numerical device models. The models describe the cathode one dimensionally and are valid also at high injection levels. The temperature dependence of the photon absorption coefficients and temperature and doping dependencies of electron mobilities are modelled. Simulated device characteristics are presented and the factors determining the efficiency of the PETE devices are discussed. Our results show that Si, GaAs, and InP are all promising materials for PETE solar cells, if the surface recombination, effective electron affinities, and thermal stability of these materials can be optimized. Owing to their strong absorption, GaAs and InP show higher efficiencies (20–25%) than Si (10–15%) in spite of their intense radiative recombination. Especially, InP is a promising candidate for PETE cathodes as it shows higher efficiency than GaAs due to its stronger photon absorption properties.

Abstract: The adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are extensively utilized in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and cell therapy. ADMSCs can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and it has been shown that over-expression of a cocktail of factors can induce ectopic heart formation and program cardiogenesis in ESCs. However, which genes are responsible for differentiation of ADMSCs into beating cardiomyocyte-like cells remains unknown. In this study we have shown that the combination of Gata4, Tbx5 and Baf60c is sufficient for inducing ADMSCs to form cardiomyocytes. It also appears that, while Gata4 and Baf60c are key inducers of myocardial differentiation, Tbx5 is essential for the ability of cardiac cells to contract. These findings provide additional experimental references for myocardial tissue engineering in the emerging field of cell-based therapy of heart diseases.

Abstract: In the innate immune system, a variety of recognition molecules provide the first-line host defense to prevent infection and maintain endogenous homeostasis. Ficolin is a soluble recognition molecule, which senses pathogen-associated molecular patterns on microbes and aberrant sugar structures on self-cells. It consists of a collagen-like stalk and a globular fibrinogen-like domain, the latter binding to carbohydrates such as N-acetylglucosamine. Ficolins have been widely identified in animals from higher invertebrates to mammals. In mammals, ficolins form complexes with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), and ficolin-MASP complexes trigger complement activation via the lectin pathway. Once activated, complement mediates many immune responses including opsonization, phagocytosis, and cytokine production. Although the precise function of each ficolin is still under investigation, accumulating information suggests that ficolins have a crucial role in host defense by recognizing a variety of microorganisms and interacting with effector proteins.

Abstract: An important issue in construction of organic photovoltaic cells concerns the selective contacts. Here, especially the modification of the hole-extraction is challenging, as energy levels have to match the polymer's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). We took the view to the mutual anode interface and we sought for a solution-based alternative for commonly used PEDOT:PSS – with an eye on improving the hole-extraction with an inorganic interlayer. We present copper iodide (CuI) as a versatile inorganic p-type semiconductor that meets the requirements for enhanced charge extraction in donor polymers. We applied two types of anthracene-containing PPE–PPV block–copolymers that recently gained attention as efficient active absorbers in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells. We report on the advantages using CuI as hole-selective contact and show an improvement of the power conversion efficiency in polymer-based solar cells.

Abstract: Plant lectins have been studied as histological markers and promising antineoplastic molecules for a long time, and structural characterization of different lectins bound to specific cancer epitopes has been carried out successfully. The crystal structures of Vatairea macrocarpa (VML) seed lectin in complex with GalNAc-α-O-Ser (Tn antigen) and GalNAc have been determined at the resolution of 1.4Å and 1.7Å, respectively. Molecular docking analysis of this new structure and other Tn-binding legume lectins to O-mucin fragments differently decorated with this antigen provides a comparative binding profile among these proteins, stressing that subtle alterations that may not influence monosaccharide binding can, nonetheless, directly impact the ability of these lectins to recognize naturally occurring antigens. In addition to the specific biological effects of VML, the structural and binding similarities between it and other lectins commonly used as histological markers (e.g., VVLB4 and SBA) strongly suggest VML as a candidate tool for cancer research.

Abstract: We have demonstrated accelerated degradation studies of organic photovoltaic materials using concentrated sunlight, where the atmosphere, temperature and illumination intensity were independently controlled. Testing various schemes for controlling the sample temperature under concentrated sunlight showed that heating of P3HT:PCBM was caused by photons at the absorbed wavelength range and dissipation of excess photon energy, and not necessarily by IR photon absorption. Sunlight chopping was found to be an effective method for independent temperature control under illumination by concentrated sunlight. The first accelerated degradation tests using sunlight concentration applied to P3HT:PCBM blends were reported. P3HT:PCBM blends exposed to concentrated sunlight in the presence of traces of oxygen/ humidity showed degradation induced by photo-oxidation of the P3HT backbone within the P3HT:PCBM blend, which is significantly thermally accelerated, in agreement with previous observations. However, this could be demonstrated in a time scale of minutes and hours, that is, significantly accelerated. Exposure of well encapsulated P3HT:PCBM films to concentrated sunlight demonstrated stability up to 3,600 sun⁎hours, corresponding to about 1.6 years of operating time. This result was obtained at 300 suns exposure after merely 12h, demonstrating the advantage of using concentrated sunlight for accelerated stability tests. These tests can therefore combine extremely high acceleration factors with profound understanding of the effect of various, independently controlled factors on the degradation mechanisms.

Abstract: The CdTe/Sb2Te3 interface was prepared by co-evaporation on an ultra-thin glass substrate and studied “in-situ” by photoelectron spectroscopy using a tunable synchrotron radiation photon source. The results indicated that the as-deposited antimony telluride was a mixture of Sb–Te phase and Sb2Te3 structure. The band diagram showed a conduction band offset (ΔECB) of 0.65eV at the interface. A thin layer of Sb2Te3 came into being on the surface of CdTe with a subsequent 300°C anneal. The sputter depth profile suggested that the annealed interface was actually constituted by the “substrate CdTe/interface Sb+Cd donors/inner Sb–Te mixture/surface Sb2Te3” structure. The band diagram gave ΔECB=1.35eV for the annealed interface. It was found that there was a thin barrier of 0.2eV induced by Sb+Cd donors for the hole transportation at the interface. To create a thin p+ layer between CdTe and the back electrode, a 50Å thick Sb2Te3 layer was used for the back contact to CdTe thin film solar cells. J–V characteristic showed that this thin p+ back contact greatly enhanced the cell performance.

Abstract: Electro-reflective properties in the mid-IR of a series of electropolymerized poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) layers were studied in their doped and dedoped states and correlated to their morphology and electronic conductivity properties. The films were prepared on ITO electrodes using lithium perchlorate or lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate as supporting electrolyte and acetonitrile as solvent. In order to investigate the effect of the surface morphology, each side of the films was studied, i.e. either the smooth surface in contact with the ITO substrate during synthesis or the rougher surface in contact with the electrolytic medium which morphology varies with the polymerization charge density. For both salts, the IR reflectivity of doped films having similar electronic conductivity decreases drastically upon increasing surface roughness. This was attributed to enhanced absorption in the same way as reported for metallic surfaces. Therefore the full control of the morphology may improve the device optical properties in the IR range. In addition, whatever the electrolyte, the IR reflectivity is shown to follow the same trend as a function of the electronic conductivity varying over about five orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the electro-reflective behavior of PEDOT layers can be described by the Drude model provided the electronic conductivity exceeds 90Scm−1. By several aspects, these films have thus a quasi-metallic behavior. Finally, the highest and lowest reflectivity obtained in the 8–20µm range for these PEDOT layers is 67% and 21% respectively, which opens up interesting perspective in view of the elaboration of PEDOT-based devices with tunable IR electro-reflective properties.

Abstract: The morphology of organic photovoltaics plays a significant role in the resulting power conversion efficiency of the device. In this study, we used Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscope (EFTEM) techniques to create cross sections of solar cells and to study the phase separation and morphology. Combining the images obtained from EFTEM with simple absorption and exciton diffusion models, we are able to predict the short circuit current (JSC) of these devices. The predicted current of the ideal device, annealed at 160°C for 20min, showed that 36% of the current comes from island areas, suggesting short distance hopping is responsible for some charge collection. For a device annealed at 160°C for 10h, the model estimates 15% of the current coming from island areas. This information suggests that over-annealed devices experience a current drop due to large phase separation and not from an increase in non-geminate recombination.

Abstract: Low temperature (30–200°C) drift characteristics of mobile ions in PECVD SiNx films and solar cells were determined for the first time using a non-contact ion-drift spectrometry technique adopted from silicon integrated circuit (IC) metrology. The results demonstrate drift of Na+ ions in PECVD SiNx films that begin at temperatures as low as 50°C. This is a seemingly contrasting behavior as compared to SiNx films used in microelectronics where it provides excellent protection as a diffusion barrier. The present study was carried out on SiNx films and final solar cells intentionally contaminated with Na, K, and Cu. In non-contact ion-drift spectrometry an electric field across the dielectric is created by charge deposited on the dielectric surface with a corona discharge in air. Temperature stress is applied by ramping the temperature with time at a controlled rate. Ion drift decreases the dielectric voltage that is monitored with a vibrating Kelvin-probe. Voltage versus time, voltage versus temperature, and corresponding derivative characteristics are used to quantify drift velocity, ion concentration and drift activation energy. The latter produces characteristic ion peaks in the derivative spectra dV/dT versus temperature. The metrology version for mobile ion mapping is based on whole-wafer corona bias-temperature stress at selected temperatures corresponding to drift of different ions. The mapping is a powerful means for ion source identification, such as Na from cell encapsulation glass. It shall prove advantageous for further clarification of the role of Na in potential induced degradation (PID) effects i.e. the polarization effect and the potential induced shunting (PIS).

Abstract: Interdigitated back-contact (IBC) solar cells were fabricated with a process sequence combining local ion implantation of phosphorus and full area BBr3 furnace diffusion resulting in conversion efficiencies of up to 22.4%. The highly doped emitter and BSF are in direct contact to each other (p+n+ junction) leading to a controlled junction breakdown at low reverse-bias voltages of around 5V. The breakdown was located at the p+n+ junction and found to be homogeneously distributed over the whole cell area. This is not critical for module integration as the absolute temperature rise of a reverse-biased cell was determined to be less than 35K. After reverse breakdown, the conversion efficiency degraded by 1–2% absolute due to additional recombination at the p+n+ junction. The cell performance could be fully recovered by a short annealing at 300°C indicating that the Al2O3 passivation was altered by the reverse breakdown. This might be a fundamental issue for Al2O3 passivated IBC solar cells without gap between emitter and BSF, independent from the doping method.

Abstract: In this work, we report a nonionic surfactant (polyethylene glycol 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyne-5,8-diol ether, PEG-TmDD) that can improve the wetting property of PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the organic photoactive layer and simultaneously enhance the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film up to 526S/cm. Furthermore, the conductivity enhancement is significantly dependent on the thermal annealing, which is contrary to the conductivity behavior of PEDOT:PSS film prepared from the formulation added with ethylene glycol (EG) where the conductivity is almost independent of the thermal annealing. The temperature dependence of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS by PEG-TmDD is possibly ascribed to decomposition of PEG-TmDD into EG and TmDD during thermal annealing. With the high conductivity and good wetting on the active layer, PEDOT:PSS mixed with PEG-TmDD is used as the top electrode for organic solar cells. The cells exhibit a fill factor of 60% and a power conversion efficiency of 4.1% using poly(3-hexylthiophene):indene-C60 bis-adduct as the active layer. The results indicate that the new formulation of PEDOT:PSS mixed with PEG-TmDD is suitable for preparing a top electrode for vacuum-free organic solar cells.

Abstract: Planar organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) based on the heterojunction subphthalocyanine/fullerene (SubPc/C60) were fabricated by varying the nature of hole transporting layer (HTL) and the SubPc thickness. The performances of the efficient heterojunction SubPc/C60 are improved through the use of MoO3/CuI double HTL. In comparison with OPV using MoO3 alone as HTL, the insertion of CuI leads to a significant increase in the short circuit current due to improved hole mobility. With the MoO3/CuI HTL, the power conversion efficiency was maximized to nearly 5% at a SubPc thickness of 20nm. The atomic force microscopy study shows that the morphology of the SubPc films depends on the HTL. With CuI, the SubPc films are more homogeneous, with a smoother surface. These morphology differences induce modifications of the electrical properties of the SubPc. J–V characteristics of hole only devices, i.e. devices with SubPc inserted between two high work function electrodes, show that the hole mobility in SubPc deposited onto CuI is higher than that in films deposited onto MoO3.

Abstract: The aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 1 is an essential mitochondrial transporter that exchanges intramitochondrial aspartate and cytosolic glutamate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is expressed in brain, heart and muscle and is involved in important biological processes, including myelination. However, the signals that regulate the expression of this transporter are still largely unknown. In this study we first identify a CREB binding site within the aspartate/glutamate carrier gene promoter that acts as a strong enhancer element in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. This element is regulated by active, phosphorylated CREB protein and by signal pathways that modify the activity of CREB itself and, most noticeably, by intracellular Ca2+ levels. Specifically, aspartate/glutamate carrier gene expression is induced via CREB by forskolin while it is inhibited by the PKA inhibitor, H89. Furthermore, the CREB-induced activation of gene expression is increased by thapsigargin, which enhances cytosolic Ca2+, while it is inhibited by BAPTA-AM that reduces cytosolic Ca2+ or by STO-609, which inhibits CaMK-IV phosphorylation. We further show that CREB-dependent regulation of aspartate/glutamate carrier gene expression occurs in neuronal cells in response to pathological (inflammation) and physiological (differentiation) conditions. Since this carrier is necessary for neuronal functions and is involved in myelinogenesis, our results highlight that targeting of CREB activity and Ca2+ might be therapeutically exploited to increase aspartate/glutamate carrier gene expression in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a relatively new approach in the treatment of various cancers including leukemia cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of apoptosis and autophagy after treated by protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-mediated SDT (PpIX-SDT) on human leukemia K562 cells as well as the relationship between them. Firstly, mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis was observed through morphological observation and biochemical analysis. Meanwhile, SDT was shown to induce autophagy in K562 cells, which caused an increase in EGFP-LC3 puncta cells, a conversion of LC3 II/I, formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and co-localization between LC3 and LAMP2 (a lysosome marker). Besides, pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or bafilomycin A1 was shown to provide protection against autophagy and to enhance SDT-induced apoptosis and necrosis, while the apoptosis suppressor z-VAD-fmk failed to affect formation of autophagic vacuoles or partially prevented SDT-induced cytotoxicity, which suggested that SDT-induced autophagy functioned as a survival mechanism. Additionally, this study reported apparent apoptosis and autophagy with dependence on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Preliminary data showed that ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively blocked the SDT induced accumulation of ROS, reversed sono-damage, cell apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective in our experimental system, and the ROS caused by PpIX-SDT treatment may play an important role in initiating apoptosis and autophagy.

Abstract: The use of environmental friendly solvents for the fabrication of solution processed organic photovoltaics is a key issue to scale up the technology. Nowadays however, toxic and harmful chlorinated solvents are largely used in polymer solar cell laboratory research. In this work we successfully reached high solubility and miscibility of the low band gap polymer Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PBDTTT-E-F, commonly known as PTB7), blended with [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl-ester ([70]PCBM fullerene derivative) in a non-chlorinated solvent (Dimethylbenzenes also known as Xylenes). We studied the solar cells realized depositing blend solutions based on various Xylenes (ortho, para and an isomeric mixture from technical grade) achieving high power conversion efficiencies up to 8.7%.

Abstract: The performance of tandem stacks of Group III–V multijunction solar cells continues to improve rapidly, both through improved performance of the individual cells in the stack and through increase in the number of stacked cells. As the radiative efficiency of these individual cells increases, radiative coupling between the stacked cells becomes an increasingly important factor not only in cell design, but also in accurate efficiency measurement and in determining performance of cells and systems under varying spectral conditions in the field. Past modeling has concentrated on electroluminescent coupling between the cells, although photoluminescent coupling is shown to be important for cells operating near their maximum power point voltage or below or when junction defect recombination is significant. Extension of earlier models is proposed to allow this non-negligible component of luminescent coupling to be included. The refined model is validated by measurement of the closely related external emission from both single and double junction cells.

Abstract: Flame retardance of shape stabilized phase change materials (SSPCM) based on paraffin, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and styrene–butadiene–styrene copolymer (SBS) was investigated. The effects of organomontmorillonite (OMMT), expanded graphite (EG) and crosslinking of the polymer matrix were evaluated by means of horizontal burning test, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter. The results showed that the addition of EG and OMMT increased the burning time greatly. The treatment temperature of EG also played an important role owing to the different pore sizes and expansion ratios. When the polymer matrix was crosslinked by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), the burning time was further prolonged. TGA results indicated that the vaporization and thermo-oxidation temperature increased and the decomposition of the polymer matrix was hindered in flame retardant SSPCM. The cone calorimeter test demonstrated that the peak heat release rates (PHRR) of flame retardant SSPCM decreased by up to 72.7%, and the formation of CO2 and CO decreased significantly. The horizontal burning tests implied that the best flame retardant performance was achieved in SSPCM containing OMMT/EG/TBHP which has the longest burning time and large amount of char residue. The flame retardant mechanism was also discussed.

Abstract: Tubular Si-infiltrated SiCf/SiC composites composed of an inner cellular ceramic and an outer dense Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) skin have been fabricated by the electrophoretic deposition of matrix phases followed by Si-infiltration for pre-feasibility testing in solar receiver applications. The tubes have been considered to be used as high temperature receiver components for the solar operation of a gas turbine or a combined cycle with temperatures up to 1300°C and typical pressures of more than 6bar. The cellular structure inside the tube has been introduced for the improvement of heat transfer from the irradiated outer surface of the tube to the working fluid inside. Heat transfer and permeability characteristics of the composite samples have been determined experimentally as effective properties. These properties have been used in numerical models to predict the performance of such kind of components in gas turbine service conditions. It could be demonstrated, that the heat transfer rate in a tube with a porous in-lay could be increased to approximately four times compared to the rate of an empty tube of the same size. The results of the study give reason for further experimental testing in service environments.

The incoming solar radiation is first collected and focused by the system. A rectangular fused silica light guide and a 2D-CPC concentrator are then combined to further compress the concentrated solar radiation into the laser rod within a V-shaped pumping cavity. 4.4W continuous-wave TEM00 mode (M2≤1.05) 1064nm solar laser power is finally produced, attaining 4.0W laser beam brightness figure of merit, which is 2.1 times higher than the previous record by a Fresnel lens. 0.81% TEM00 mode laser slope efficiency is achieved.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) plays multiple roles in cell growth and proliferation. Deletion/insertion mutations in exon 12 of NPM1 (NPM1-DIM), commonly found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alter the C-terminal amino acids and disrupt the normal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling function of the protein, which in turn leads to disease pathogenesis. However, this altered function as a result of NPM1-DIM positivity is actually associated with a significantly better response to therapy and overall survival, and thus it is of clinical relevance to investigate the mutation status at diagnosis. Our objective was to design a reliable flow cytometry assay to detect mutated NPM1 in peripheral blood (PB) samples from AML patients, using a polyclonal mutation-specific antibody.
Methods
A commercially available NPM1 mutation-specific polyclonal antibody in combination with a secondary goat antirabbit antibody was used to detect the C-terminal-mutated NPM1 by flow cytometry. OCI/AML3 (+) cell line and clinical PB controls were used to optimize the assay and determine sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility parameters. The assay was then tested on a small cohort of 12 AML patients at diagnosis and compared with NPM1-DIM testing on a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform.
Results
Flow cytometry using the polyclonal antibody was able to reliably detect mutated NPM1 populations of at least 10%. Using an objective analysis of the mean fluorescent intensity, clear positive and negative mutated cell populations could be distinguished using the clinical AML samples. From the analysis of 12 patients, 2 were found to be positive using this assay, which corresponded with conventional PCR methodology.
Conclusions
Flow cytometry may be used to detect NPM1 C-terminal mutations in AML patients using a polyclonal anti-NPM1 antibody, allowing rapid mutation status determination at diagnosis.

Abstract: Using a combination of quantum dots (QDs) of different sizes, and thus different bandgaps, to extend the light-harvesting spectrum of a photovoltaic device in tandem architecture is a promising strategy for increasing the solar cell efficiency. In this study, we propose a new architecture for a solar cell device consisting of a graded-bandgap active layer made of lead sulfide QDs of different sizes and based on the structure of the Schottky junction. Colloidal PbS QDs with bandgaps of 1.55, 1.44, and 1.36eV were synthesized and used to construct a series of Schottky junction solar cells. Cells with a graded-bandgap active layer exhibited an increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) but yielded lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared with cells having a uniform bandgap. We found that adding a thin electron energy-boosting layer (EEB) made from 1.55-eV-bandgap QDs can partially compensate for the thermalization loss, and thus enhance Jsc and recover Voc. Consequently, this study provides a conceptual basis for further improvement in colloidal QD-based solar cells.

Abstract: A study on the effect of the n-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) buffer layers at the I/N interfaces on the overall performance of superstrate (pin-type) hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) single-junction solar cells with wide band gap silicon oxide doped supporting layers is presented. By integrating the n-type a-Si:H materials with proper band gap and thickness values at the I/N interface, the band gap discontinuity between the μc-Si:H intrinsic and n-type nc-SiOx:H layers can be successfully compensated for, thereby improving the carrier collection, reducing the accumulation and recombination of photo-generated carriers near the I/N interface, and improving the overall current and power output of the μc-Si:H cells. Further adoption of an optimized hydrogen profiling technique based on the optimized n-type a-Si:H buffer layers yields an initial conversion efficiency of 10.05% for μc-Si:H single-junction solar cells with a thickness of 2μm.
Keywords: Microcrystalline silicon; Buffer layer; Band gap discontinuity; Recombination.

Abstract: Spectral selective coatings for solar thermal receivers have been fabricated by laser sintering of tungsten micro and nano particles on stainless steel substrate and show solar absorptance of ~90% at room temperature. The coatings remain stable after heat treatment at 650°C in air for at least 36h. A high figure of merit of ~50 has been achieved for laser sintered coatings. Two laser scans were performed at different energy densities, one to sinter nanoparticles and other to control surface morphology, so that high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance can be achieved. Laser sintering was carried out under atmospheric pressure that enabled the formation of a protective oxide layer that provided thermal stability to 650°C. Solar thermal receivers in tower systems operate at high temperatures in air and laser sintering is a promising approach to fabricate spectral selective receiver coatings for this application.

Abstract: Dual oxidase 2 enzyme is a member of the reactive oxygen species-generating cell membrane NADPH oxidases involved in mucosal innate immunity. It is not known if the biological activity of dual oxidase 2 is mediated by direct bacterial killing by reactive oxygen species produced by the enzyme or by the same reactive oxygen species acting as second messengers that stimulate novel gene expression. To uncover the role of reactive oxygen species and dual oxidases as signaling molecules, we have dissected the pathway triggered by epidermal growth factor to induce mucins, the principal protective components of gastrointestinal mucus. We show that dual oxidase 2 is essential for selective epidermal growth factor induction of the transmembrane MUC3 and the secreted gel-forming MUC5AC mucins. Reactive oxygen species generated by dual oxidase 2 stabilize tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and induce MUC3 and MUC5AC through persistent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2–protein kinase C. Knocking down dual oxidase 2 by selective RNA targeting (siRNA) reduced epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation, and MUC3 and MUC5AC gene expression. Extracellular reactive oxygen species produced by dual oxidase 2, upon stimulation by epidermal growth factor, stabilize epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2–protein kinase C which induce MUC5AC and MUC3. Extracellular reactive oxygen species produced by dual oxidase 2 that are known to directly kill bacteria, also contribute to the maintenance of the epidermal growth factor-amplification loop, which induces mucins. These data suggest a new function of dual oxidase 2 protein in the luminal protection of the gastrointestinal tract through the induction of mucin expression by growth factors.

Abstract: A selection of granular natural and ceramic materials has been experimentally characterized with regard to their application as heat transfer and storage media in concentrating solar power plants. Thermophysical, thermomechanical, tribological and rheological measurements have been conducted in order to identify the most suitable candidates for this dynamic high temperature operation. Ceramic materials are found to comprise some advantages, but natural products offer a considerably more economic solution. Thermal bulk conductivity is found to be only marginally affected by the solid's thermal conductivity, while specific heat is the same for all solids. Ceramics entirely withstand thermal cycling, while quartz-containing materials are prone to severe degradation. Most materials are found to attain a saturated state of attrition while being sheared under load, wherein quartz sand offers the lowest mass fraction of debris at saturation level. In the investigated grain size range, all materials show good flowability. The generation of debris requires consideration in the design of the CSP storage components.

Abstract: Recently, biphenolic components derived from the Magnolia family have been studied for anti-cancer, anti-stress, and anti-inflammatory pharmacological effects. However, the pharmacological mechanism of action of 4-O-methylhonokiol (MH) is not clear in oral cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of MH in apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, HN22 and HSC4, as well as tumor xenografts. Here, we demonstrated that MH decreased cell growth and induced apoptosis in HN22 and HSC4 cells through the regulation of specificity protein 1 (Sp1). We employed several experimental techniques such as MTS assay, DAPI staining, PI staining, Annexin-V/7-ADD staining, RT-PCR, western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay and in vivo xenograft model analysis. MH inhibited Sp1 protein expression and reduced Sp1 protein levels via both proteasome-dependent protein degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis in HN22 and HSC4 cells; MH did not alter Sp1 mRNA levels. We found that MH directly binds Sp1 by Sepharose 4B pull-down assay and molecular modeling. In addition, treatment with MH or knocking down Sp1 expression suppressed oral cancer cell colony formation. Moreover, MH treatment effectively inhibited tumor growth and Sp1 levels in BALB/c nude mice bearing HN22 cell xenografts. These results indicated that MH inhibited cell growth, colony formation and also induced apoptosis via Sp1 suppression in OSCC cells and xenograft tumors. Thus, MH is a potent anti-cancer drug candidate for oral cancer.

Abstract: A solar cell based on vertically aligned silicon p–i–n, core–shell–shell, nanowires interfacing with graphene film is proposed to exploit the benefits of short carrier collection lengths of radial p–i–n junction nanowires and transparency of graphene. A physical device model incorporated with optical characteristics taking into account all recombination processes is established to optimize its electrical performance by modifying nanowires density, filling ratio and thickness. Also, the dependence of the proposed structure to temperature variations and the number of graphene layers on its performance is investigated.

Abstract: In this work we studied the influence of the annealing treatments of a sol–gel derived ZnO electron transport layer deposited on ITO substrate, on the performances of inverted bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells using a blend of poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiopene)-2,6-diyl] and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester. Since the annealing treatments needed to complete the formation of the solution-processed ZnO film can modify the underlying ITO electrode, we analyzed the performance of the fabricated cells in terms of the properties of ITO and ZnO films. We found a linear relationship between the sheet resistance of the ITO layer and the series resistance of the corresponding device, which strongly influences the fill factor. The best power conversion efficiency (7%) under simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100mW/cm2 was achieved for the polymer solar cell fabricated using a ZnO film annealed at 150°C for only 5min. Higher annealing temperatures and times increase the sheet resistance of the ITO worsening the device performances.

Abstract: Life-long hematopoietic demands are met by a pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with self-renewal and multipotential differentiation ability. Humoral and paracrine signals from the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment control HSC activity. Cell-to-cell communication through connexin (Cx) containing gap junctions (GJs) allows pluricellular coordination and synchronization through transfer of small molecules with messenger activity. Hematopoietic and surrounding nonhematopoietic cells communicate each other through GJs, which regulate fetal and postnatal HSC content and function in hematopoietic tissues. Traffic of HSC between peripheral blood and BM is also dependent on Cx proteins. Cx mutations are associated with human disease and hematopoietic dysfunction and Cx signaling may represent a target for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we illustrate and highlight the importance of Cxs in the regulation of hematopoietic homeostasis under normal and pathological conditions.

Abstract: The atomic and electronic structure of tin tungstates, α-SnWO4, α-Sn1.03W0.99O4 and β-SnWO4, was studied by the W L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO) calculations based on the hybrid exchange-correlation density functional (DFT)/Hartree–Fock (HF) scheme. It was found that the crystal structure of both α-phases is built up of strongly distorted WO6 octahedra, whereas that of β-SnWO4 is composed of nearly regular WO4 tetrahedra. In addition, there are distorted SnO6 octahedra in both α- and β-phases. The metal–oxygen octahedra distortion is explained by the second-order Jahn–Teller effect. The influence of pressure on the structure of α-SnWO4 and β-SnWO4 was studied in detail based on the calculated equations of state. The compressibility of β-SnWO4 was found to be larger than that of α-SnWO4. The existence of the insulator-to-metal transition was theoretically predicted in α-SnWO4 at about 16GPa and was explained by a symmetrization of metal–oxygen octahedra leading to a strong interaction of Sn 5s, W 5d and O 2p states and closing of band gap.

Abstract: The use of graphene as transparent conducting layer in devices that require high temperature processing is proposed. The material shows stability upon thermal treatments up to 1100°C if capped with a sacrificial silicon layer. The use of Cu foil or evaporated Cu as catalysts in Catalytic-Chemical Vapor Deposition growth gives rise to graphene of similar properties, which represents a promising result in view of its direct integration in microelectronic devices. Photovoltaic p–i–n thin film devices were fabricated on the as-deposited or annealed graphene membranes and compared with similar devices that incorporate as-deposited Indium Tin Oxide. No degradation in series resistance is observed for the annealed device. A 3.7% and 2.8% photovoltaic conversion efficiency is observed on the devices fabricated on as-transferred and on annealed graphene respectively. The major limitation derives from the high sheet resistance of the as-transferred state-of-the-art material. The results opens the way to the use of graphene in applications that require transparent conducting layers resistant to high temperature processing.

Abstract: Inverted type organic solar cells have been regarded more promising over normal type, owing to a favorable vertical phase separation and air-processability. Many techniques, such as thermal or solvent annealing, slow growth method, melting bi-layers etc. have been employed to improve the morphology of photoactive layer, which is one of the advantages of inverted type OSCs. As a result, the device performance is greatly enhanced which is also reflected in the current-density versus voltage curve. However, some of the methods presented above are difficult and costly to perform. In addition, inverted OSCs still employ certain metal oxide electron-transporting layers, which impose UV activation time due to light-soaking effect. Here we show a facile method that can control the vertical phase separation as well as minimize the light-soaking effect. By leaving the photoactive solution with a low volatile solvent in air before spin coating, conductive polymers (donor) and fullerene derivatives (acceptor) were separated vertically in a way that their charge extraction is enhanced. Besides, oxygen and impurities at the contact on ETL were removed by leaving the solution for a certain period. Mechanisms of these improvements were evidenced by various analytical techniques and empirical tests using different materials in different environments. We anticipate this finding can expedite the OSC research and its usage in all air-processed inverted OSCs.

Abstract: We studied the band offset and alignment of pulsed laser deposited TiO2/CuGaO2 hetero-structure using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Valance band offset (VBO) of TiO2/CuGaO2 interface was calculated using Kraut equation as 2.15eV, which was in corroboration with VBO obtained directly from valance band onsets. A schematic band alignment diagram for the TiO2/CuGaO2 interface was constructed which showed a type II band alignment with a significant band bending of 0.48eV. Interface studies of TiO2/CuGaO2 hetero-structure, showing type II band alignment, is important for gaining insight to the design of various photovoltaic devices based on such hetero-structures.

Abstract: We report on the study of InGaAsP solar cells grown by solid-state molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on InP. The effect of growth temperature on device performance is investigated. Under standard one-sun air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5) illumination, an efficiency of 18.8% has been obtained for In0.78Ga0.22As0.48P0.52 single-junction solar cells grown at high temperature. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) results demonstrate that the In0.78Ga0.22As0.48P0.52 optical quality is greatly improved in the case of a high growth temperature. A longer PL decay time of In0.78Ga0.22As0.48P0.52/InP in contrast to In0.78Ga0.22As0.48P0.52/In0.52Al0.48As indicates that InP is more promising as the back surface field for future solar cell performance improvements.

Abstract: In this paper, a simple method was developed to prepare the submicron-sized multilayered TiO2 “donuts” (MLTDs), which were constructed by orderly-arranged nanosheets with thickness of ~9nm. Based on the investigation of the time-dependent and other control experiments, a nucleation-assembling-growth mechanism was proposed to describe the formation of the MLTD structure. Then, the MLTDs were introduced into the quantum-dot (CdS/CdSe) sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) as the photoanode materials. For comparison, QDSSCs based on the randomly assembled nanosheets-based microspheres (RATSs) and commercial P25 nanoparticles were also assembled. Maximum incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) value of 57% was observed for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized MLTDs architectures, which was higher than those of RATSs and P25 (50% and 54%, respectively ). The enhanced IPCE observed in the MLTDs architectures was mainly attributed to the increased absorption of light. Moreover, the large pore size distribution of MLTDs might be beneficial for electrolyte penetration. Based on these advantages, MLTDs-based QDSSCs demonstrated the highest conversation efficiency of 4.5% in all the three types of QDSSCs.

Abstract: Glazing based on thermochromic thin films has been noted to potentially reduce the energy demand in buildings by modulating the solar heat gain depending on the coating temperature. Such “intelligent” glazing has been researched for a number of years with little attention paid to the thermochromic transition details such as the transition width and transition gradient. In this study we use idealised thermochromic spectra and the programme Energy Plus to simulate the effect of simultaneous variations in thermochromic transition width and gradient on building energy demand in order to elucidate which parameters are the most important for optimal energy saving behaviour. The investigation takes place across warm, varied and cold climates and the results are compared against current industry standards. The results suggest that under ideal conditions energy savings of greater than 50% compared to standard double-glazing are obtainable in a hot climate where the thermochromic transition occurs at a low temperature with a narrow hysteresis and sharp gradient.

Abstract: Following the detailed balance principle, we have systematically investigated the electricity generation from the infrared thermal radiation by 6.1Å Sb-based converters. By simulating the converters in their possible single/multiple-junction configurations, the GaSb lattice-matched InAs0.91Sb0.09 alloy has been demonstrated not only to be an attractive converter for a broadband emitter operating at 1200–1500K but also a potential subcell candidate to design high-performance tandem converters. To construct the tandem converters, it is shown that, for both mechanically-stacked and series-interconnected configurations, the GaInAsSb alloy's optimum bandgap Ego dependence on the emitter temperature TBB easily yields a quadratic equation Ego=αTBB2+βTBB+γ with α, β, and γ the fitted structure-dependent parameters. These results provide some favorable guidelines to develop more powerful thermophotovoltaic devices.

Abstract: In the present study, we describe the existence of a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channel in the mitochondria of Dictyostelium discoideum. A single-channel current was recorded in a reconstituted system, using planar lipid bilayers. The large-conductance potassium channel activity of 258±12pS was recorded in a 50/150mM KCl gradient solution. The probability of channel opening (the channel activity) was increased by calcium ions and NS1619 (potassium channel opener) and reduced by iberiotoxin (BKCa channel inhibitor). The substances known to modulate BKCa channel activity influenced the bioenergetics of D. discoideum mitochondria. In isolated mitochondria, NS1619 and NS11021 stimulated non-phosphorylating respiration and depolarized membrane potential, indicating the channel activation. These effects were blocked by iberiotoxin and paxilline. Moreover, the activation of the channel resulted in attenuation of superoxide formation, but its inhibition had the opposite effect. Immunological analysis with antibodies raised against mammalian BKCa channel subunits detected a pore-forming α subunit and auxiliary β subunits of the channel in D. discoideum mitochondria. In conclusion, we show for the first time that mitochondria of D. discoideum, a unicellular ameboid protozoon that facultatively forms multicellular structures, contain a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel with electrophysiological, biochemical and molecular properties similar to those of the channels previously described in mammalian and plant mitochondria.

Abstract: The presence of PSS in solution processed high conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) limits the reliability and lifetime of organic photovoltaic devices due to its acidic and hygroscopic nature. We have developed an alternative PSS-free transparent electrode, based on vapor-phase polymerized (VPP) PEDOT in combination with a current collecting silver grid. The hybrid electrode exhibits a low sheet resistance of 1.6Ω/□ with an excellent bending proof performance. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 2.63% in a 1.21cm2 area device with a stacking structure of PET/Ag-grid/VPP-PEDOT/ZnO/poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN)/poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM)/MoO3/Al. This efficiency is lower than, but comparable to the PCE (3.36%) of a control device with similar structure PET/Ag-grid/PH1000/ZnO/PFN/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Al. A striking advantage using VPP-PEDOT to replace PH1000 is the high ambient stability of the device. The PCE of un-encapsulated devices after 120h continuous exposure to ambient oxygen and moisture is retained at a 75% level of its initial value. These results suggest that the Ag grid/VPP-PEDOT is a promising alternative to ITO or high conducting PEDOT:PSS for realization of high efficiency, low cost and stable organic solar cells (OSCs).

Abstract: In this study, a series of shape-stabilized comb-like polymeric phase change materials (CLPPCMs), denoted as EMA-g-CnH2n+1OH (poly(ethylene-graft-maleic anhydride)-g-alkyl alcohol) with n=14, 16, 18, 26, were prepared through an esterification reaction between poly(ethylene-graft-maleic anhydride) (EMA) and n-alkyl alcohols (CnH2n+1OH). The structure, thermal properties and shape-stabilized performance of EMA-g-CnH2n+1OH CLPPCMs were investigated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). EMA-g-CnH2n+1OH CLPPCMs show a good thermal stability and shape-stabilized performance. With the side-chain length increasing, the phase transition temperature and the heat enthalpy change from 36.4 to 67.1°C and from 125.7 to 146.2J/g, respectively, demonstrating a side-chain length-dependent behavior. EMA-g-CnH2n+1OH CLPPCMs prove the excellent thermal reliability and structure stability after 300 heating–cooling cycles. The time of heat storage and release lasts for 205 and 49s, respectively. EMA-g-CnH2n+1OH CLPPCMs show their potential applications under 300°C as the thermal energy storage materials.

Abstract: Selective laser ablation of dielectric films for local contact formation is an attractive process simplification for high efficiency silicon solar cell fabrication. In high efficiency applications, the goal of laser ablation is spatially selective removal of surface dielectric layer(s) with minimal modification to the electronic properties of the substrate, equivalent to the performance benchmark set by photolithography processing. In this work, we present detailed characterisation of direct, 248nm, nanosecond laser ablation of a Si3N4/SiO2 dielectric stack for rear contact openings in a high efficiency interdigitated back contact solar cell. The efficacy of the ablation process is determined by the influence of the laser irradiation on three properties of the ablated region: pre-existing near surface dopant profiles, recombination activity, and the resistivity of the contact formed through the ablated opening. It is found that sufficient optical attenuation occurs in the Si3N4 layer at 248nm to perform direct ablation. Despite visual evidence of near surface silicon melt formation, there is no measurable change in dopant distribution. Furthermore, we show that there is no increase in recombination activity beyond that expected for the underlying diffused and unpassivated surface, and contact resistivity below 0.1mΩcm2 is achieved for vacuum evaporated aluminium on boron-diffused silicon. Back contact solar cells processed with laser ablated contact openings demonstrate conversion efficiencies equivalent to photolithography processed controls. An independently verified small-area device efficiency of 23.5% with an open-circuit voltage of 696mV is achieved, a record efficiency for a laser processed crystalline silicon solar cell.

Abstract: We studied in detail the voltage dependence of two-step photocurrent generation through a two-step process of absorbing sub-band gap photons of different photon energies in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot Intermediate Band Solar Cell. Our experiments revealed that two-step photocurrent generation is largely dependent on voltage, and exhibits a maximum at −0.3V. A notable feature is a monotonic decrease in two-step photocurrent in the forward bias region, where the operating point of the solar cell lies. Using a model of rate equations, we extracted the voltage dependence of the individual escape and recombination rates, and found that the decrease in two-step photocurrent in the forward bias region is related to a monotonic increase in recombination rate in the quantum dots with increasing bias.

Abstract: Glutathione reductase (GR), a homodimeric FAD-dependent disulfide reductase, is essential for redox homeostasis of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and has been proposed as an antimalarial drug target. In this study we performed a virtual screening against PfGR, using the structures of about 170,000 natural compounds. Analysis of the two top-scoring molecules, TTB and EPB, indicated that these ligands are likely to interact with the homodimer intersubunit cavity of PfGR with high binding energy scores of −9.67 and −9.60kcal/mol, respectively. Both compounds had a lower affinity for human GR due to differences in structure and electrostatic properties. In order to assess the putative interactions in motion, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 30ns, resulting in TTB being more dynamically and structurally favored than EPB. A closely related compound MDPI 21618 was tested on recombinant PfGR and hGR, resulting in IC50 values of 11.3±2.5μM and 10.2±1.7μM, respectively. Kinetic characterization of MDPI 21618 on PfGR revealed a mixed-type inhibition with respect to glutathione disulfide (Ki=9.7±2.3μM) and an uncompetitive inhibition with respect to NADPH. Furthermore, MDPI 21618 was found to inhibit the growth of the chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 with an IC50 of 3.2±1.9μM and the chloroquine-resistant Dd2 strain with an IC50 of 3.2+1.6μM. In drug combination assays with chloroquine, artemisinin, or mefloquine MDPI 21618 showed an antagonistic action, which might suggest partially overlapping routes of action. This study further substantiates research on PfGR as a potential antimalarial drug target.

Abstract: Photoelectric conversion efficiency enhancement of the emerging highly efficient, low cost organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells, which is considered as a promising candidate in solar energy industry, has received great attention. And, it is investigated that the device performance can be significantly improved simply by a convenient morphology controlling approach aiming at obtaining uniform and high coverage of perovskite. However, reliable means to prepare high-quality perovskite layer remains to be a big challenge. In this work, we proposed a novel, simple and efficient method in optimizing the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films. Utilizing this excellent rapid fabrication process, our devices present an average power conversion efficiency of 9.65% with remarkable reproducibility, which is about 42% higher with respect to devices produced by regular protocol. This work sheds a light on enhancing performance of the state-of-the-art solar cells by exploring novel methods to prepare photoactive layers of high-quality.

Abstract: In this study, an in situ grafting/crosslinking method was employed to prepare form stable thermal regulating fibers (TRFs). The fibers were made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, as fiber polymer), polyethylene glycol (PEG, as phase change material) and butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA, as crosslinking agent) and spun by dry spinning. The addition amount of BTCA and thermal treatment temperature for preparation were optimized by studying the reaction kinetics of PVA/BTCA and PEG/BTCA composite systems. The structures and properties of PEG/PVA/BTCA composite fibers were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), two-dimensional wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results show that small amounts of BTCA can form adequate chemical bonds to fix PEG in the PEG/PVA/BTCA composite at proper temperatures in the thermal treatment. In composite fibers, the crystallization of PVA promotes the phase separation between PVA and PEG, and the crosslinkages confine the crystallization of PEG. In the as-spun fiber, the crystallization of PEG occurred along the normal direction of the fiber axis. During the stretching, the original orientation of PEG crystals in fibers was destroyed and then new crystalline orientation formed along the fiber axis. The cross-sections of the composite fibers are almost round; after being extracted, the fibers crosslinked by BTCA are denser and have fewer defects than un-crosslinked PEG/PVA fiber, which demonstrated that the PEG can be fixed steadily in PVA fiber matrix by the in situ grafting/crosslinking method.

Abstract: In this review we examine the role of self-organization in the context of the evolution of morphogenesis. We provide examples to show that self-organized behavior is ubiquitous, and suggest it is a mechanism that can permit high levels of biodiversity without the invention of ever-increasing numbers of genes. We also examine the implications of self-organization for understanding the “internal descriptions” of organisms and the concept of a genotype-phenotype map.

Abstract: In order to improve the conversion efficiency of the solar cell, the ZnO/Ni multilayer thin film used in back electrode was prepared through the electroless plating and sol–gel methods. The morphology, structure and resistivity of the electroless nickel coating were measured by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and four-point probe resistivity tester, respectively. It was found that the nickel coating presented crystalline structure with the lowest resistivity of 4.33×10−5Ωcm. The effect of the ZnO sol concentration, annealing temperature and the number of the spin-coating layers on the crystal structure, film morphology and photoelectric performance were also studied. The light trapping structure was found on the surface of ZnO layer when the sol concentration, annealing temperature and the number of the spin-coating layers were 0.75mol/L, 300°C and 4, respectively. The average transmittance in the visible light range (390–780nm) was about 1.06% by visible spectrophotometer. The ZnO/Ni multilayer film could be used in back electrode for solar cell and would improve the properties of the solar cell.

Abstract: Plasma membranes have heterogeneous structures for efficient signal transduction, required to perform cell functions. Recent evidence indicates that the heterogeneous structures are produced by (1) compartmentalization by actin-based membrane skeleton, (2) raft domains, (3) receptor–receptor interactions, and (4) the binding of receptors to cytoskeletal proteins. This chapter provides an overview of recent studies on diffusion, clustering, raft association, actin binding, and signal transduction of membrane receptors, especially glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptors. Studies on diffusion of GPI-anchored receptors suggest that rafts may be small and/or short-lived in plasma membranes. In steady state conditions, GPI-anchored receptors form transient homodimers, which may represent the “standby state” for the stable homodimers and oligomers upon ligation. Furthermore, It is proposed that upon ligation, the binding of GPI-anchored receptor clusters to cytoskeletal actin filaments produces a platform for downstream signaling, and that the pulse-like signaling easily maintains the stability of the overall signaling activity.

Abstract: TiO2 is the preferred photoanode material for dye-sensitized solar cells owing to its unique structural and photoelectric characteristics. Because of the weak light scattering, ultrafine TiO2 nanoparticles were regarded as unpromising materials for light scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells. We successfully developed a novel nanostructured anatase TiO2 (below 20nm), i.e., ultrafine dice-like TiO2 with nano-concavity and facet-to-facet joints. Compared with spherical nanostructures with point-to-point joints, the dice-like TiO2 film as photoanode displays some surprising characteristics such as superior light scattering, highly photoelectric conversion performance and inhibiting multilayer dye aggregation. We further fabricate ultrafine–ultrafine anatase TiO2 combination of dice-like TiO2 as scattering layer and commercial TiO2 (P-18) as highly transparent active layer. Because of the bilayer TiO2 combination, the energy conversion efficiency could be enhanced significantly to 8.66%, 36% higher than that of the device with commercial TiO2 nanospheres (200nm) as scattering layer. The well-balanced combination is a novel practicable strategy to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.

Abstract: Solar photovoltaic energy generation can benefit from high efficiency, environment specific design. In this work, a model is developed to assess the electrical energy produced by concentrator solar cells during specific time frames with varying realistic weather conditions and cell temperatures. The model is applied to a comparative study of the spectral and temperature sensitivities of efficiency and energy production for tandem junction and spectrally split parallel junction solar cell structures. Direct normal solar spectra in a representative sunny site, Tucson, Arizona are calculated using the SPCTRAL2 model at 15-minute intervals throughout a year with real-time meteorological data input. The corresponding efficiencies of the two devices under 500 times concentration at cell temperatures deduced from thermal modeling with real-time ambient temperatures are computed. Both device structures comprise the same materials, InGaP, GaAs and Ge, and each device design is optimized to standard operating conditions (AM1.5D spectrum and a cell temperature of 25°C). The two devices are compared for their efficiencies and power/energy output at (i) 15min intervals (instantaneous values), (ii) daily and (iii) yearly time spans. Despite efficiency loss due to series resistance that is three times as high as that for the tandem junction, the parallel junction has a higher daily averaged efficiency every single day, and its yearly averaged efficiency is 1.2% absolute higher, meaning an additional annual energy production of 19.2MWh per m2 cell area. Besides energy forecast and assessment, the developed method can be used to obtain optimum solar cell designs for maximum energy production under varying geographical and climatic conditions.

Abstract: The temperature-induced ageing mechanisms and long-term stability of solar thermal absorbers having aluminium substrate with and without anodized aluminium oxide layer were investigated. A thin Al layer was used to act as an IR reflector on anodized aluminium oxide layer. The absorbers studied were industrial, sputtered chromium-based absorber coatings. The absorbers were aged by means of prolonged and extended thermal accelerated ageing studies at 248–308°C. The ageing mechanisms and degradation of the absorbers were analysed by optical measurements (solar absorptance with a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer and thermal emittance by FTIR spectrophotometry), microstructural analysis using transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), composition by time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA), and crystal structure by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) before and after the ageing studies. The relation between optical degradation and ageing mechanisms was studied using optical modelling and simulation with CODE Coating Designer. The results clearly demonstrated the effect of substrate material on the long-term stability of the absorber at intermediate temperatures.

Abstract: It is known that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess a high light absorption coefficient with a very broad spectrum, showing good potential for solar-thermal conversion. Bi2Te3 is a typical thermoelectric material with high thermoelectric conversion efficiency. In this study, we first fabricated several simple elements based on p- and n-type Bi2Te3 respectively. By integrating p- and n-type elements in series, we constructed a novel solar thermoelectric conversion device covered with 0.32g/m2 CNT sheets, which showed a high light absorption coefficient and generated a large short-circuit current (Isc) of 200mA. The size of the cross section of each series element was 0.19×0.19cm2. Thus, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was as high as 5520mA/cm2. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device reached 400mV. Each element of the device displayed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1% in the near-infrared (NIR) region by a narrow band diode laser source with light flux of 100mW/cm2 without using any optical or thermal concentrator. Furthermore, the device is stable, durable and capable of operating at high temperatures and thus is promising for converting sunlight into electricity. This work provides a simple and convenient approach to prepare solar-energy conversion devices for large-scale applications in the future.

Abstract: The effect of the thin native silicon dioxide (SiO2) interfacial layer on the photovoltaic characteristics of gold/p-type amorphous boron carbon thin film alloy/silicon dioxide/n-type silicon/aluminum (Au/a-BC/SiO2/n-Si/Al) solar cells is investigated. a-BC thin film alloy was deposited on n-Si substrate with an SiO2 layer using a reactive sputtering system. The front and back surfaces of this a-BC/SiO2/n-Si solar cell were covered with Au and Al electrodes, respectively. a-BC thin film alloys and Au/a-BC/SiO2/n-Si/Al solar cells were annealed at 623K in an atmosphere of argon. Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the a-BC thin film alloy has a D band and a G band and the boron/carbon ratio is 12.4%. The optical band gap and electrical resistivity of the a-BC thin film alloy are 1.90eV and 7.73×104Ωm, respectively. Under illumination at 1000W/m2, the Au/a-BC/SiO2/n-Si/Al solar cell exhibits a short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency of 165A/m2, 0.22V, 0.904, and 3.3%, respectively. Remarkably, the Au/a-BC/SiO2/n-Si/Al solar cell has a fill factor of 0.934 at an illumination intensity of 200W/m2, which exceeds any value obtained to date. The thin SiO2 layer improves the photovoltaic characteristics of Au/a-BC/SiO2/n-Si/Al solar cells, and the reasons for this improvement are discussed herein.

Abstract: Microcrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells were fabricated at high absorber layer deposition rates from 1.0 up to 2.5nm/s. High efficiencies of 9.6% (1.0nm/s) and 8.6% (2.5nm/s) were achieved using a very high frequency (VHF) of 140MHz for the deposition of all silicon layers (p–i–n). Using such a high frequency in the VHF band is unique in the field of thin-film silicon solar cells. The efficiencies obtained especially at very high rates belong to the highest reported efficiencies so far for this technology. This shows that VHF deposition with frequencies larger than 100MHz is very well suited for a highly productive solar cell fabrication. The VHF power homogeneity problem can be solved by using for example the linear plasma source concept developed at FAP GmbH/TU-Dresden. We show that the efficiency at very high rates of 2.5nm/s is limited by an increased crack formation in the absorber layer.

Abstract: In this study, quantum dots solar cells (QDSSCs) based on TiO2/CdS(SILAR)/CdSe(Colloid)/ZnS(SILAR) photoanodes were prepared using colloidal and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods. The efficiency increased from 1.56% to 2.07% because the conduction band (CB) of the CdSe (size ~3nm) QDs was increased compared to both TiO2 and CdS. As a result, the stimulated electrons were efficiently injected into the CB of the TiO2 and CdS. Additionally, we focused on the dynamic process in the QDSSCs using one I–V curve and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).

Abstract: Adipogenesis is governed by a plethora of regulatory proteins which are most commonly controlled by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Here, we show that the differentiation of LiSa-2 preadipocytes is associated with an increase of cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1), COP9 signalosome (CSN), neddylated cullin 3 (Cul3) and the BTB protein Keap1. Silencing of CAND1 leads to a decrease and reduced integration of Keap1 into Cul3-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL3) and to a retardation of adipogenesis. Transient transfection of LiSa-2 cells with CAND1 targeting miRNA148a also reduces Keap1 and slowed down adipogenesis of LiSa-2 cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that CAND1 acts as a BTB-protein exchange factor for CRL3 complexes. The specific increase of neddylated Cul3 might be explained by the recruitment of Cul3 or CRL3 in a membrane-bound location during adipogenesis. Together, the results show that during adipogenesis in LiSa-2 cells a CAND1-dependent remodeling and activation/neddylation of CRL3 complexes take place.

Abstract: Phthalocyanine-based light harvesting nanomaterials are attractive due to their low cost, eco-friendly properties and sensitivity in the red region of the solar spectrum. However, for any practical application, phthalocyanines need to be chemically modified for anchoring groups with wide-band semiconducting nanomaterials. In this paper, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) was functionalized with two carboxyl groups containing a biologically important ligand, tartrate, using a facile wet chemistry route and duly sensitized zinc oxide (ZnO) to form nanohybrids for application in photocatalytic devices. The nanohybrids have been characterized using a high-resolution transmission/scanning electron microscope (HRTEM, FEG-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), steady-state infrared/UV–vis absorption and emission spectroscopy for their structural details and optical properties, whereas the ultrafast dynamical events, which are key for understanding the photocatalytic activities, were monitored using picosecond resolution fluorescence techniques. More specifically, vibrational spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the covalent connection of ZnPc with the host ZnO nanoparticles via the tartrate ligand. The efficiency of the material for photocatalysis under red light irradiation was found to be significantly enhanced compared to bare ZnO. A mechanistic pathway for the formation of photo-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an aqueous medium for the photocatalytic efficacy was investigated. To make a prototype for a potential application in a flow device for water decontamination, we have sensitized ZnO nanorods (ZnO NR) with tartrate-functionalized ZnPc. The molecular proximity of ZnPc to the ZnO surface has been confirmed by picosecond resolution Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) from the intrinsic emission of surface defects of ZnO NR to the attached ZnPc. The excited-state electron transfer dynamics, as revealed by a picosecond resolution fluorescence study (TCSPC), is in good agreement with the enhanced charge separation at the interface of the nanohybrid. The enhanced photoresponse, wavelength-dependent photocurrent of the sensitized nanorods and photodegradation of a model water pollutant in a prototype device format confirmed the potential use of the nanohybrids in water purification.

Abstract: Thin film and core–shell nanowire heterostructures containing copper indium gallium sulfide Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) as light absorber are fabricated by low cost, solution based processes. The unique structures consist of ZnO and CdS or (Zn,Mg)O core–shell nanowire arrays embedded inside CIGS thin films for solar cell applications. Nontoxic (Zn,Mg)O buffer layer deposited by atomic layer deposition is proven to be suitable for replacing solution grown CdS for fabricating CIGS nanowire solar cells. A systemic comparison of device performance is made between the CIGS nanowire solar cells and their thin film counterparties with different final treatment temperatures. Overall, the nanowire devices show higher efficiency than the corresponding planar structures fabricated under similar conditions. Effect of nanowire on the solar cell performance is further studied by using nanowires of various lengths, which reveals that the longer nanowire arrays resulted in a higher short circuit current. This study represents the first working CIGS nanowire solar cells reported so far and provides an opportunity for investigating the mechanism of nanowire solar cells using a well-defined material system.

Abstract: The sintering of nanocrystals to form a bulk film is a promising route for the production of low cost Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells. However, very little is known about how the synthesis of the nanocrystals impacts the properties of the sintered film or the performance of the resulting photovoltaic device. Here, we present a study in which devices were made from NC inks with different reaction times. Variation in reaction time produces inks with different average size, composition, and compositional heterogeneity. Accounting for the influence of composition, we find that longer NC reaction times result in improved current collection, larger quasi-Fermi level splitting, lower defect concentrations, and higher power conversion efficiency in the selenized devices. The improvements correlate well with the breadth of the x-ray diffraction peaks, suggesting that the longer reaction times result in larger crystalline domain sizes, and that grain boundaries may act as non-radiative recombination sites. Further, the crystalline domain size in the sintered film is proportional to the mean NC size in the ink, suggesting that some interparticle sintering occurs but that the ultimate grain size in the film is dependent on the starting NC size.

Abstract: Paraffin is a common organic phase change material (PCM) that finds many applications in thermal energy storage (TES) systems. One common characteristic of organic PCMs is their low thermal conductivities. This – in turn – causes a slow thermal response when paraffin is used in high power applications. In this study, paraffin–nanomagnetite (Fe3O4) composites (PNMC) were prepared by a dispersion technique to enhance their thermal properties. Nano magnetite prepared using the cost-effective sol–gel method was mixed into paraffin at two different mass fractions: 10% and 20%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphologies of nanomagnetite and PNMCs during different stages of the composite production process. SEM analysis results showed that nanomagnetite particles of 40–75nm in size were homogeneously distributed in the paraffin structure. The latent heat storage capacity of PNMC, measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at 1°C/min, was found to be 8% higher than paraffin alone. Thermal conductivities and diffusivities of paraffin and PNMCs were determined by the “DICO” method. For 10% and 20% by weight PNMCs, the thermal conductivities were increased by 48% and 60%, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is an efficient and cost effective method to enhance the heat transfer properties of paraffin, when they are incorporated into latent heat storage systems.

Abstract: We have developed a novel spectrally splitting hybrid solar receiver by combining a simple dichroic filter and a liquid channel as a selective absorbing medium. The combination acts as a band pass filter for silicon solar cells. The geometry can be optimised for any linear concentrator; in this paper we have optimised it for a commercially available linear rooftop micro-concentrator. The optics of the concentrator at its focal region has been investigated using ray tracing. A simple 5-layer dichroic filter made of titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide has been designed, optimised, and fabricated with a focus placed on manufacturing simplicity. It has been shown that such a filter directs 54.5% of the concentrated light to the silicon photovoltaic cells; the Si cells considered in this paper can convert 26.1% of this energy into electricity which is significantly higher than their 20.6% efficiency under the full spectrum. This is due to the fact that 73.3% of the incident flux is within the cell's relatively high spectral response range, which can be efficiently converted into electricity. The rest of the spectrum can be collected as high temperature heat. This research shows the possibility of employing low-cost direct absorption-dichroic filtering hybrid receivers in liner concentrators.

Abstract: Lowe syndrome is a lethal X-linked genetic disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and kidney dysfunction. It is caused by mutations in the OCRL1 (oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe) gene that encodes a phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.36). The gene product Ocrl1 has been linked to a multitude of functions due to the central role played by phosphoinositides in signaling. Moreover, this protein also has the ability to bind Rho GTPases, the master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and to interact with elements of the vesicle trafficking machinery. It is currently under investigation how deficiencies in Ocrl1 affect these different processes and contribute to patient symptoms. This chapter outlines the known physiological roles of Ocrl1 which might be relevant to the mechanism underlying Lowe syndrome.

Abstract: In this experiment, we used a vacuum impregnation method to prepare shape stabilized PCM that contained sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP), to improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs, and prevent leakage of the liquid state of PCMs. Na-MMT has low cost and natural abundance, high adsorption and absorption capacities, and fire retardant heating rate. In the used materials, xGnP, usually produced from graphite intercalated compounds, are particles consisting of several layers of graphene sheets. As a result, we found that the FTIR adsorption spectra of paraffinic PCMs did not change, and there was no chemical interaction between paraffinic PCMs and xGnP/Na-MMT mixture. From the DSC analysis, xGnP made an impact on the thermal properties of the paraffinic PCMs/Na-MMT composites. The oxidation rate of paraffinic PCMs based composite with xGnP was greater than that of the composite without xGnP. FTIR, DSC, TGA and TCi were used to determine the characteristics of the paraffinic PCMs/Na-MMT composites.

Methyl donor deficiency in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts induces ER stress as an important part of the proteome response,

Abstract: Deficiency of methyl donors (MDs, folate, vitamin B12, and choline) causes increased plasma level of Hcy, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Previously, we showed that maternal MD deprivation altered the cardiac proteome of rat pups. To better understand its impact on cardiac cells, we exposed rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts to selectively a synthetic folate- or MD-deficient (FD or MDD) medium. We found that a 4-day exposure to the FD medium, unlike the MDD one, did not cause an abnormal extracellular release of Hcy relatively to similar exposure to the control complete (C) medium. Comparative analyses of the proteomes of FD, MDD, and C cells identified 7 and 6 proteins up- or downregulated by either deficiency, respectively. Most proteins were found interrelated in a single network dealing with “post-translational modification, protein folding and cell death/survival” (FD cells) or “DNA replication/recombination/repair and cell morphology/compromise” (MDD cells). Both deficiencies altered the protein and mRNA levels of the chaperones α-crystallin B, protein disulfide-isomerase A4, and prohibitin. This was concurrent with rapid induction of several key genes of the ER stress response, notably gadd153/chop, and increased expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1, and MAFbx. In conclusion, the effects of folate and MD deficiencies on the cardiomyoblast proteome display some dissimilarities possibly related to different cellular production of Hcy. In both cases activation of the ER stress could occur in response to accumulation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins.

Abstract: The inspection and measurement of solar cells has become an important technique in evaluating the efficiency and quality of solar cell devices. Currently, surface defect detection of solar cells can be achieved by several approaches such as machine vision, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence imaging techniques. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to inspect the inner structures of solar cells. In response to this need, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have become common techniques for investigating the nanostructures of solar cells. However, both carry the disadvantages of destructive imaging, high cost, and a small inspection area. Moreover, it is difficult to simultaneously estimate multiple optical properties with the aforementioned techniques. In this study, we propose the use of phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) for the inspection of solar cells. We develop a two-reference-arm configuration to reduce the phase noise that intrinsically accompanies the OCT system. Based on the proposed approach to extract the amplitude and phase terms from OCT interference signals, the 3D microstructure of solar cells can be obtained while simultaneously probing the nanostructures on arbitrary planes of the solar cell. The OCT microstructural results show that the structures of different layers can be nondestructively visualized and quantitatively evaluated. From the phase signal, the inverted pyramid structure, which is commonly used for the reduction of interface reflection, can be visualized. Moreover, based on the two-reference-arm configuration, the optical reflection coefficient (ORC) can be estimated in order to evaluate the interface reflection from the surface of solar cell. Results show that PS-OCT can be a valuable tool for providing nondestructive inspection of the micro/nanostructures of solar cells.

Abstract: In this work the long term stability of silicon solar cells with a copper front side metallization based on a fine-line screen-printed silver seed-layer, a plated nickel diffusion barrier, a plated copper conductive layer and a silver capping is investigated in detail. Silicon nitride layers deposited by PECVD or sputtering effectively hinder copper diffusion, which might occur e.g. at contact edges. To investigate the plated nickel diffusion barrier, fast degradation of full size 156×156mm² cells at elevated temperatures on hotplates and module degradation in the climate chamber executing a damp heat test were performed. Plated nickel thickness influences the degradation speed on cell level. On module level, only the cell without diffusion barrier shows a degradation of 1.2% rel. in efficiency (IEC criteria passed) after 1500h damp heat test (85°C, 85% r.h.). The cells with diffusion barrier do not show any degradation. Comparison of cell and module results indicate that fast degradation on hotplates at cell level gives a reasonable first estimate regarding cell degradation due to copper diffusion.

Abstract: Autophagy is a degradation pathway that is conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms and plays important roles in the tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses. It functions as a housekeeping process to remove unwanted cell components under normal conditions, and is induced during stress and senescence to break down damaged cellular contents and to recycle materials. The target components are engulfed into specialized transport structures termed autophagosomes and are subsequently delivered to the vacuole for degradation. Here, we review milestones in the study of autophagy in plants, discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism and physiological roles of plant autophagy, and highlight potential future directions of research.

Abstract: Casting technologies of multi-crystalline (mc) silicon ingots in photovoltaic industry are reviewed in this paper and three main types of cast ingots are introduced. Cell efficiency distribution of the three types of ingots, i.e. common mc-silicon ingots, mono-like silicon ingots and super high efficiency mc (S-mc) silicon ingots, is examined, calculated and compared. It is found that the cell efficiency distribution of the three types of ingots is different because of their different defect characteristics. Common mc-silicon is used as the study baseline. Both mono-like and S-mc wafers have significantly better cell performance. Solar cells made from mono-like wafers have high efficiency close to mono-crystalline CZ wafers, however, the efficiency distribution is wide. Meanwhile, S-mc silicon wafers have much narrower cell efficiency distribution than mc-silicon wafers and mono-like silicon wafers in the experiments. Main defects affecting cell performance are studied and the theories of how grain size affects cell performance are discussed in the paper too. Moreover, several casting technologies which can be used to achieve even higher quality cast ingots to further increase solar cell efficiency are proposed. These new casting technologies only increase the manufacturing cost on a small scale, however, they will greatly boost the wafers value in the solar market and accelerate the progress of Grid Parity.

Abstract: A method to exploit both the wavelength shifting and light concentrating properties of luminescent plates in order to increase the current output of CdS/CdTe solar cells has been investigated. The application of concentrating luminescent down-shifting structures onto CdS/CdTe solar cells in order to combine the benefits of light concentration and wavelength shifting properties of luminescent plates is proposed. This technique is particularly effective in CdS/CdTe solar cells with a poor short wavelength response. An increase in the current output of close to 10% was measured on application of concentrating luminescent down-shifting structures compared to nearly 5% without light concentration to such solar cells. Concentrating luminescent down-shifting structures containing multiple fluorescent species allowed the absorption ability of the device to be extended to a wider range of wavelengths. This combined with strong energy transfer that red-shifts photons to wavelengths with even better solar cell response is seen to result in increases greater than 20% in the short circuit current output of CdS/CdTe solar cells. A general analytical expression that models different methods of applying of luminescent plates to solar cells is proposed which describes the performance of concentrating luminescent down-shifting structures well and can be used to separate the contributions of luminescence and incident excitation photons on the current output. These expressions can also be used to estimate the transport and reflection losses in these devices.

Abstract: Trefoil Factor 1 belongs to a group of small secreted proteins (the Trefoil Factor Family proteins), that are localized within the mucous granules and are expressed and secreted by epithelial cells that line mucous membranes. Trefoil factors are mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, where they normally contribute to maintain the integrity of the mucosa. We recently demonstrated a selective binding ability of Trefoil Factor 1 for copper ions, through its carboxy-terminal tail, and we also observed that copper levels influence the equilibrium between the monomeric and homodimeric forms of Trefoil Factor 1, thus modulating its biological activity. Here we report that transcriptional regulation of Trefoil Factor 1 is also affected by copper levels, through the modulated binding of the copper-sensing transcription factor Sp1 onto the responsive elements present in the regulatory region of the gene. In addition we demonstrate that copper overload causes an accumulation of the trefoil protein in the Trans-Golgi Network and that Trefoil Factor 1 levels can influence copper excretion and copper related toxicity. These findings suggest that the protein might play a role in the overall complex mechanisms of copper homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tissues.

Abstract: The two key issues of front contact of screen-printed multi-crystalline silicon have been studied. Firstly, the effects of doping profiles in the emitter on the contact-resistance have been systematically investigated. Constant source diffusion is used to explain the doped phosphorus profile in the textured emitter by simulation. Secondly, the penetration mechanism of silver into SiNx layer was studied by using SEM and EDX to reveal the microstructure of the Ag/Si contact. A model has been proposed to explain the formation of the ohmic contact. It is found that the effectiveness of the contact is determined by the direct contact area of the silver crystallites to both the emitter and the finger. For a commercial multi-crystalline silicon solar cell of 156×156mm2, the optimal contact-resistance of about 1.2mΩ is suggested, corresponding to the doping sheet resistance of around 80–90Ω/□. Multi-crystalline Si solar cells with excellent results, up to 18.51% in conversion efficiency, have been achieved. Moreover, to further understand the model, effects of the firing temperature and the thickness of SiNx layer on the contact-resistance have been investigated in the solar cells. It is proved that the formation of the silver crystallites is related to the existence of SiNx layer.

Abstract: Photooxidation of indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) and indene-C60 monoadduct (ICMA) was studied using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), IR spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. MALDI-TOF MS suggested that the oxidation occurred on the fullerene cage of ICBA or ICMA and that the oxidation of ICBA proceeded faster than that of ICMA. The IR study and DFT calculation indicated that carbonyl substituents were generated upon photoirradiation. The effects of the oxidized ICMA were examined by measuring the device properties of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The increase in energy levels of fullerene derivatives affects the stability against photooxidation negatively, while it increases the open circuit voltage of OPV devices. These results indicate that it is important to balance the OPV performance with stability against photooxidation.

Abstract: Regeneration studies in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis have recently been focused on the potential of adult stem cells to replace injured tissues and organs during the adult life cycle using the oral siphon (OS) as a model. The OS has oral siphon pigment organs (OPOs) along its rim and an underlying network of muscle fibers in its tube. Different regeneration processes are triggered by OS amputation at the tip, along the tube, or at the base. One process involves the replacement of OPOs without new cell division by direct differentiation of locally deployed stem cells or stem cells that migrate from the branchial sac. Another process involves blastema formation by the migration of progenitor cells produced from branchial sac stem cells. The capacity for complete and accurate OS regeneration declines continuously during the adult life cycle. Finally, after an age threshold is reached, OS regeneration ceases in old animals. The loss of regeneration capacity in old animals involves the depletion of stem cells in the branchial sac, the inability of branchial sac progenitor cells to migrate to the sites of regeneration, and defective oral pigment organ replacement. The significance of the OS model for studying regeneration, stem cells, and aging will be enhanced by the application of molecular methods.

Abstract: Development of solar energy conversion devices based on nano-fabrication techniques is the key to next generation photovoltaics. However, low throughput and complicated production procedures have limited their emergence at commercially relevant scales. In this article we report an inexpensive, high-throughput, versatile and reproducible technique for fabrication of vertically aligned CdTe nanorod arrays with coverage over a significantly large area through selective electrodeposition (PatED) on lithographically patterned nanoelectrodes. The nanoelectrodes are patterned using the Nanosphere Photolithography (NPL) technique which uses size-controlled polystyrene spheres as microlenses to focus light into photonic jets on an underlying photoresist. The nanorod diameter and pitch could be controlled through optimization of the NPL process. This generalized technique provides a way for production of wafer-scale nanorod arrays on conducting surfaces for solar energy conversion. Observed photocurrent density from the nanorod device is more than two times higher than thin films fabricated under similar conditions, in spite of actual coverage for the nanorod device being ~12% compared to the thin film. In addition to improved photocurrent generation, reduced material consumption due to enhanced effectiveness at lower coverage and simplicity of the fabrication technique makes this process ideal for the cost-effective production of high efficiency solar cells at commercial scale.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex biological program during which cells loss epithelial phenotype and acquire mesenchymal features. EMT is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of various fibrotic diseases including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Recent studies suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with EMT in the progression of PF. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Here, we developed a PF model with bleomycin (BLM) administration in rats and conducted several simulation experiments in alveolar epithelial cell (AECs) RLE-6TN to unravel the role of inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1) – X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) signal pathway in ER stress-induced EMT in PF. First, we observed that ER stress was occurred in type II AECs accompanied by EMT in BLM-induced PF. Then we explored the role of IRE1-XBP1-snail pathway in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/tunicamycin (TM)-induced EMT. When TGF-β1/TM was treated on AECs, IRE1 and XBP1 were overexpressed, meanwhile, snail expression was upregulated accompanied with EMT. However, when IRE1 or XBP1 was knockdown, TGF-β1/TM-induced EMT were blocked while the expression of snail was inhibited. Then we silenced snail and found that TGF-β1/TM-induced EMT were also suppressed, but it had no effect on the up-regulated expression of IRE1 and XBP1. Thus, we concluded that IRE1-XBP1 pathway promotes EMT via mediating snail expression in PF.

Abstract: The interaction of solar radiation with nanoporous composites with a high water vapor adsorption capacity compared to materials used in external building surfaces was investigated in a wind tunnel with adjustable environmental parameters. Prior to the tunnel experiments, all of the materials were characterized using various techniques, and their thermal and optical properties were determined. In cyclic experiments inside the tunnel, the maximum temperature in the nanoporous materials under simulated solar radiation was considerably lower than the corresponding temperature inside marble dust or soil. In addition, the temperature differences between the humid and non-humid nanoporous samples under simultaneous irradiation increased with increasing solar absorbance, which was primarily due to evaporative cooling. In addition, solar reflectance and emittance increased upon water vapor adsorption. Energy balance analysis revealed that the absorbed solar radiation was primarily transformed to heat desorption energy to compensate for the electrostatic attraction of water vapor to the negatively charged particle surfaces. A decrease in the released heat in the environment indicates the need for more sun- and hydrophilic urban surfaces.

Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is closely associated with the onset of diabetes and its complications. However, its roles in diabetic retinopathy are unknown. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are a crucial component of the outer blood–retina barrier and their death is related to the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Thus, we examined the pathophysiological role of GLP-1R in RPE cell apoptosis. We found that GLP-1R expression was lower in the isolated neuroretina and RPE cells of streptozotocin-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. High-glucose treatment also decreased GLP-1R expression in a human RPE cell line (ARPE-19 cells). GLP-1R was silenced in ARPE-19 cells, in order to elucidate the pathophysiological roles of GLP-1R. This increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activated p53-mediated Bax promoter and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. We also found that GLP-1R knockdown-mediated p53 expression was regulated by ER stress. Interestingly, antioxidant treatment and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) overexpression attenuated GLP-1R knockdown-induced ER stress signaling and p53 expression. Finally, to confirm that GLP-1R activation has protective effects, ARPE-19 cells were treated with exendin-4, a synthetic GLP-1R agonist. This attenuated high-glucose-induced ROS generation, ER stress signaling, and p53 expression. Collectively, these results indicated that hyperglycemia decreases GLP-1R expression in RPE cells. Such a decrease generates intracellular ROS, which increases ER stress-mediated p53 expression, and subsequently causes apoptosis by increasing Bax promoter activity. Our data suggested that regulation of GLP-1R expression is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) films were grown by electrochemical deposition, and we measured the work function of the as-grown and of the KCN-etched CZTS surfaces by using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy with incident laser wavelengths of 488.0 and 632.8nm, respectively, and the results indicate that a secondary phase formed at different depths. The KPFM measurements can discriminate phase uniformity at the nano-scale. Secondary phases, such as Cu2−xS (0<x<1), ZnS, and MoS2, were identified on the as-grown surface while Cu2−xS was removed from the KCN-etched surface. The KCN-etched CZTS absorption layer was measured to have a 5.0% conversion efficiency. Owing to the low cost of electrochemical deposition, it is desirable to obtain high tailored CZTS films can be obtained with the robust surface characteristics of a uniform work function with a single phase.

Abstract: The transcription factor AP-1 plays an important role in inflammation and cell survival. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system and a library of 940 candidate human secretory protein cDNA clones, we identified that CGREF1 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of AP-1. We demonstrated that CGREF1 is secreted via the classical secretory pathway through the ER-to-Golgi apparatus. Functional investigations revealed that overexpression of CGREF1 can significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK, and suppress the proliferation of HEK293T and HCT116 cells. Conversely, specific siRNAs against CGREF1 can increase the transcriptional activity of AP-1. These results clearly indicated that CGREF1 is a novel secretory protein, and plays an important role in regulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity and cell proliferation.

Abstract: We investigate the electrical and structural characteristics after ion implantation of BFx (x=1,2) for silicon solar cells. Compared to non-amorphizing species, e.g. B, amorphizing species, like BFx, offer the possibility to lower the thermal budget, which is needed for the curing of implant-induced crystal defects. For implant energies above 30keV (BF2) we find a strong degradation of the charge carrier lifetime in the volume as well as an increase of the emitter saturation current density J0 compared to implantation of elemental boron. This behavior can be related to a defective solid phase epitaxy during the recrystallization in the annealing process after implantation. Implantation of BF2 at 10keV and subsequent annealing at 1050°C for 30min results in J0 values of 41±3fA/cm² for a planar, Al2O3 passivated 133Ω/sq emitter. Furthermore, using implantation of BF2 at 20keV allows lowering the annealing temperature from 1050°C, as commonly used for elemental boron, to 950°C. The latter results in a J0 of 58±2fA/cm² for a planar, Al2O3 passivated 141Ω/sq emitter.

Bcl-xL stimulates Bax relocation to mitochondria and primes cells to ABT-737,

Abstract: Bax cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation is a central event of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Bcl-xL is an important regulator of this event and was recently shown to promote the retrotranslocation of mitochondrial Bax to the cytosol. The present study identifies a new aspect of the regulation of Bax localization by Bcl-xL: in addition to its role in Bax inhibition and retrotranslocation, we found that, like with Bcl-2, an increase of Bcl-xL expression levels led to an increase of Bax mitochondrial content. This finding was substantiated both in pro-lymphocytic FL5.12 cells and a yeast reporting system. Bcl-xL-dependent increase of mitochondrial Bax is counterbalanced by retrotranslocation, as we observed that Bcl-xLΔC, which is unable to promote Bax retrotranslocation, was more efficient than the full-length protein in stimulating Bax relocation to mitochondria. Interestingly, cells overexpressing Bcl-xL were more sensitive to apoptosis upon treatment with the BH3-mimetic ABT-737, suggesting that despite its role in Bax inhibition, Bcl-xL also primes mitochondria to permeabilization and cytochrome c release.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) have promising applications in the fields of solar energy storage, energy conservation in buildings, thermal insulation, and thermal regulation. In this study, novel multifunctional composite films were prepared via a thermosetting process using poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a film matrix, microencapsulated PCMs (micro-PCMs) as a temperature-regulating additive and TiO2 nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) as a UV-blocking additive. The latent heat of the film fabricated with 6wt% micro-PCMs and 6wt% nano-TiO2 is 9.226J/g. The film also shows high thermal stability, with no obvious change in thermal performance after 100 heating–cooling cycles. The temperature of a space enclosed by the film fabricated with 6wt% micro-PCMs and 6wt% nano-TiO2 can be controlled in the range 25–28°C for 3298s. The composite films exhibit a significantly decreased UV transmittance due to the UV absorption of nano-TiO2. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of the sample fabricated with 6wt% micro-PCMs and 6wt% nano-TiO2 is 0.2356W/(mK), which is comparable with that of a pure PVC film. These findings indicate that the novel thermal-insulating film is promising for use in energy-efficient building and automobile applications.

Abstract: The optical absorption and thermal conductivity of GaAsPN absorbers are investigated by means of optical absorption spectroscopy and photo-thermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) for different 100nm-thick GaAsNP/GaP samples under different growth conditions and various post-growth annealing temperatures. It is first shown that the As content strongly modifies the optical absorption spectrum of the GaAsPN: with a maximum absorption coefficient of 38,000cm−1 below the GaP bandgap energy. The optical absorption and thermal conductivities of the samples are then evaluated for various growth and annealing conditions using PDS: the results showing overall agreement with optical absorption spectroscopy measurements. A significant improvement in optical absorption and thermal conductivity after annealing is demonstrated. The best thermal conductivity measured is equal to 4W/mK. These results are promising for the development of absorbers in multijunction solar-cell architecture.

Abstract: Physics ruling the temperature sensitivity of photovoltaic (PV) cells is discussed. Dependences with temperature of the fundamental losses for single junction solar cells are examined and fundamental temperature coefficients (TCs) are calculated. Impacts on TCs of the incident spectrum and of variations of the bandgap with temperature are highlighted. It is shown that the unusual behavior of the bandgaps of perovskite semiconductor compounds such as CH3NH3PbI3-xClx and CsSnI3 will ultimately, in the radiative limit, give PV cells made of these materials peculiar temperature sensitivities. The different losses limiting the efficiency of present commercial cells are depicted on a p–n junction diagram. This representation provides valuable information on the energy transfer mechanisms within PV cells. In particular, it is shown that an important fraction of the heat generation occurs at the junction. A review of the loss mechanisms driving the temperature coefficients of the different cell parameters (open circuit voltage Voc, short circuit current density Jsc, fill factor FF) is proposed. The temperature sensitivity of open circuit voltage is connected to the balance between generation and recombination of carriers and its variation with temperature. A general expression that relates the temperature sensitivity of Voc to the External Radiative Efficiency (ERE) of a solar cell is provided. Comparisons with experimental data are discussed. The impacts of bandgap temperature dependence and incident spectrum on the temperature sensitivity of short circuit current are demonstrated. Finally, it is argued that if the fill factor temperature sensitivity is ideally closely related to the open circuit voltage temperature sensitivity of the cell, it depends for some cells strongly on technological issues linked to carrier transport such as contact resistances.

Abstract: A GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure with AlGaAs tunnel junction was grown on p-type (100)-oriented GaAs substrate by a solid-source molecular beam epitaxy technique. The structural and morphological properties of the GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure have been evaluated by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy measurements. In addition, the GaInP/GaAs solar cell device was fabricated to obtain electrical output parameters of the cells. For this purpose, the current–voltage measurements of solar cell devices were carried out at room temperature under both dark and air mass 1.5 global radiation (AM1.5) using solar simulator. In addition, the electrical output parameters of the GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure with the AlGaAs tunnel junction are compared with the GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure without the AlGaAs tunnel junction, and it is found that the integration of the tunnel junction into a solar cell structure improves the device performance by 48%.

Abstract: Suspended particle devices (SPDs) are able to rapidly switch from a dark bluish-black state to a clear greyish appearance when an AC electric field is applied. Two-flux and four-flux models were used to derive refractive indices and extinction coefficients, as well as scattering and absorption coefficients, of the particle-containing active layer. These entities were used in model calculations to predict direct, total and diffuse components of transmittance and reflectance, along with color appearance and haze, as a function of the thickness of the active layer. An optimum thickness for optical contrast of the SPD was determined in this way and was found to be in the range of 200–300nm. The devices exhibit significant haze particularly in reflection.

Abstract: Spectrally selective CrAlN–CrAlON based tandem absorber was deposited by magnetron sputtering and the effects of antireflection layers on the optical and thermal stability properties of tandem absorber were investigated. The thickness of the individual component layers was optimized by matrix method to achieve high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance. TEM, XRD and XPS results confirmed the microstructure of the nanocomposite CrAlN and CrAlON coatings was consisted of nanocrystalline CrN embedded in amorphous matrix of AlN or Al2O3. The optimized CrAlN/CrAlON/Al2O3 tandem absorber exhibited a high absorptance of 0.984 and a low emittance of 0.07 at 82°C. The high absorptance value of this CrAlN–CrAlON based tandem can be partially attributed to the nanocomposite structure of the CrAlN and CrAlON coatings. Accelerated aging tests indicated that the CrAlN/CrAlON/Al2O3 tandem absorbers had high thermal stability in air up to 550°C for 100h with high solar selectivity of 11.5. However, for CrAlN/CrAlON/Si3N4 tandem absorber, the emittance coefficient increased drastically above 500°C which can be attributed to the increased surface roughness and oxidation of Si3N4 antireflection layer. The CrAlN/CrAlON/Al2O3 tandem absorber with high thermal stability has great potential for application in high temperature solar selective field.

Abstract: Cannabinoids exert antitumorigenic effects via multiple mechanisms. Of these, antimetastatic and antiangiogenic actions have attracted considerable interest in the past years. Regarding the underlying antimetastatic mechanism, several studies revealed cannabinoids to alter the gene expression of cancer cells toward a less-aggressive phenotype and to modulate their secretomic profile. Cannabinoids likewise modulate the release of factors from tumor cells that subsequently suppress the chemoattraction of vessel cells thereby conferring antiangiogenesis. Among the diverse mediators of cannabinoids' antitumorigenic action, the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1, which is released from cancer cells upon cannabinoid treatment, has been implicated as a pivotal factor conferring both anti-invasive properties of cancer cells as well as antiangiogenic capacities of endothelial cells. In addition, cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit angiogenic capacities of endothelial cells directly via suppressing their proliferation, tube formation, and migration. This chapter reviews the cell- and substance-specific antitumorigenic mechanisms of cannabinoids with particular consideration of their antimetastatic/anti-invasive and antiangiogenic actions. In addition, beneficial interactions of cannabinoids with currently used chemotherapeutics as well as the influence of cannabinoids on tumor-immune surveillance are addressed. Collectively, the currently available data suggest cannabinoids as a potential tool in modern cancer pharmacotherapy.
