Abstract: In many mammalian species, the removal of one lung leads to growth of the remaining lung to near-baseline levels. In studying post-pneumonectomy mice, we used morphometric measures to demonstrate neoalveolarization within 21days of pneumonectomy. Of note, the detailed histology during this period demonstrated no significant pulmonary inflammation. To identify occult blood-borne cells, we used a parabiotic model (wild-type/GFP) of post-pneumonectomy lung growth. Flow cytometry of post-pneumonectomy lung digests demonstrated a rapid increase in the number of cells expressing the hematopoietic membrane molecule CD11b; 64.5% of the entire GFP+ population were CD11b+. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the CD11b+ peripheral blood cells migrated into both the interstitial tissue and alveolar airspace compartments. Pneumonectomy in mice deficient in CD11b (CD18−/− mutants) demonstrated near-absent leukocyte migration into the airspace compartment (p<.001) and impaired lung growth as demonstrated by lung weight (p<.05) and lung volume (p<.05). Transcriptional activity of the partitioned CD11b+ cells demonstrated significantly increased transcription of Angpt1, Il1b, and Mmp8, Mmp9, Ncam1, Sele, Sell, Selp in the alveolar airspace and Adamts2, Ecm1, Egf, Mmp7, Npr1, Tgfb2 in the interstitial tissue (>4-fold regulation; p<.05). These data suggest that blood-borne CD11b+ cells represent a population of accessory cells contributing to post-pneumonectomy lung growth.

Abstract: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor with manifold functions during development, tissue homeostasis and disease. EGFR activation, the formation of homodimers or heterodimers (with the related ERBB2-4 receptors) and downstream signaling is initiated by the binding of a family of structurally related growth factors, the EGFR ligands. Genetic deletion experiments clarified the biological function of all family members except for the last characterized ligand, epigen. We employed gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking epigen expression. Loss of epigen did not affect mouse development, fertility, or organ physiology. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed increased expression of betacellulin and EGF in a few organs of epigen-deficient mice, suggesting a functional compensation by these ligands. In conclusion, we completed the genetic analysis of EGFR ligands and show that epigen has non-essential functions or functions that can be compensated by other EGFR ligands during growth and tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Unexpected induction of arrhythmias in the heart is still one of the major risks of new drugs despite recent improvements in cardiac safety assays. Here we address this in a novel emerging assay system. Eleven reference compounds were administrated to spontaneously beating clusters of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CM) and the responses determined using multi-electrode arrays. Nine showed clear dose-dependence effects on field potential (FP) duration. Of these, the Ca2+ channel blockers caused profound shortening of action potentials, whereas the classical hERG blockers, like dofetilide and d,l-sotalol, induced prolongation, as expected. Unexpectedly, two potent blockers of the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs), HMR1556 and JNJ303, had only minor effects on the extracellular FP of wild-type hPSC-CM despite evidence of functional IKs channels. These compounds were therefore re-evaluated under conditions that mimicked reduced “repolarization reserve,” a parameter reflecting the capacity of cardiomyocytes to repolarize and a strong risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Strikingly, in both pharmacological and genetic models of diminished repolarization reserve, HMR1556 and JNJ03 strongly increased the FP duration. These profound effects indicate that IKs plays an important role in limiting action potential prolongation when repolarization reserve is attenuated. The findings have important clinical implications and indicate that enhanced sensitization to repolarization-prolonging compounds through pharmacotherapy or genetic predisposition should be taken into account when assessing drug safety.

Abstract: Endothelial cells from microvasculature are directly involved in a large number of vascular diseases; however, culture of these cells is problematic, since most methodologies employ proteolytic enzymes or mechanical techniques, leading to cell damage and contamination of endothelial cultures with other cellular types. Besides, primary cultured cells have a short life span in vitro and undergo replicative senescence after 3–4 passages, limiting long-term studies. In the present work we report the generation of a spontaneously immortalized endothelial culture obtained from mice pulmonary capillaries. Firstly, primary (third passage) and immortalized (100th) cultures were established. Further, monoclonal populations were obtained by serial dilutions from immortalized cultures. Cells were analyzed according to: (1) morphological appearance, (2) expression of specific endothelial markers by fluorescent staining [von Willebrand Factor (vWF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and Ulex europaeus (UEA-1)] and by flow cytometry (endoglin, VE-cadherin and VCAM-1), and (3) release of nitric oxide (NO), assessed by the specific fluorescent dye DAF-2 DA, and prostacyclin (PGI2), quantified by enzyme immune assay. In both cultures cells grew in monolayers and presented cobblestone appearance at confluence. Positive staining for vWF, eNOS, ACE and UEA-1 was detected in cloned as well as in early-passage cultured cells. Similarly, cultures presented equal expressions of endoglin, VE-cadherin and VCAM-1. Values of NO and PGI2 levels did not differ between cultures. From these results we confirm that the described spontaneously immortalized endothelial cell line is capable of unlimited growth and retains typical morphological and functional properties exhibited by primary cultured cells. Therefore, the endothelial cell line described in the present study can become a suitable tool in the field of endothelium research and can be useful for the investigation of production of endothelial mediators, angiogenesis and inflammation.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) over-expression is associated with tissue destruction in the context of chronic inflammation. Previous studies showed that IL-4 inhibits induction of MMP-3 by IL-1β, and suggested that AP-1 might be involved. Here we show that IL-1 induced binding of transcription factor AP-1 to the MMP-3 promoter consists primarily of c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos and that binding of c-Jun and c-Fos is inhibited by the combination of cytokines while binding of Jun B is not. Mutation of the AP-1 site in the MMP-3 promoter decreased the ability of IL-4 to inhibit its transcription in transfected MG-63 cells. Western blotting showed that both cytokines activate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but with somewhat different kinetics, and that activation of JNK by both cytokines individually is inhibited by the combination. These results indicate that IL-4 inhibition of MMP-3 expression is associated with reduction of IL-1 induced binding of active forms of the AP-1 dimer, while less active JunB-containing dimers remain, and suggest that these changes are associated with decreased activation of JNK.

Abstract: Members of transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) family are the main inducers of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) during embryogenesis and cancer pathogenesis. However, a significant crosstalk between TGF-β and other signals occurs during the induction of EMT. nm23-H1 was the first metastasis suppressor gene to be identified on the basis of an inverse relationship between nm23-H1 expression and metastasis stage. Despite extensive studies, the mechanism underlying its ability to suppress metastasis is far from elucidated. We demonstrated here that the nm23-H1 negatively regulated TGF-β1-dependent induction of EMT in non-aggressive lung cancer cell line. nm23-H1 knockdown significantly enhanced TGF-β1-induced suppression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of mesenchymal markers β-catenin and fibronectin. The invasive and migratory potential of lung cancer cells upon TGF-β1 treatment was also markedly enhanced by nm23-H1 knockdown. On the other hand, the effect of nm23-H1 depletion on TGF-β1-induced EMT was reversed by ectopic re-expression of shRNA-resistant nm23-H1 protein. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced EMT potentiated by nm23-H1 depletion was partially dependent on transcriptional factor Snail expression. Finally, we found Src kinase is involved in regulation of TGF-β1-induced EMT by nm23-H1. Our results suggest a means of restoring nm23-H1 to suppress TGF-β1-induced EMT that may exploited therapeutically for the management of metastasis diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Death receptors (DRs) of the TNFR superfamily contribute to antiviral immunity by promoting apoptosis and regulating immune homeostasis during infection, and viral inhibition of DR signaling can alter immune defenses. Here we identify the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL141 glycoprotein as necessary and sufficient to restrict TRAIL DR function. Despite showing no primary sequence homology to TNF family cytokines, UL141 binds the ectodomains of both human TRAIL DRs with affinities comparable to the natural ligand TRAIL. UL141 binding promotes intracellular retention of the DRs, thus protecting virus infected cells from TRAIL and TRAIL-dependent NK cell-mediated killing. The identification of UL141 as a herpesvirus modulator of the TRAIL DRs strongly implicates this pathway as a regulator of host defense to HCMV and highlights UL141 as a pleiotropic inhibitor of NK cell effector function.

Abstract: Summary
Host-adapted Salmonella strains are responsible for a number of disease manifestations in mammals, including an asymptomatic chronic infection in which bacteria survive within macrophages located in systemic sites. However, the host cell physiology and metabolic requirements supporting bacterial persistence are poorly understood. In a mouse model of long-term infection, we found that S. typhimurium preferentially associates with anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophages at later stages of infection. Further, PPARδ, a eukaryotic transcription factor involved in sustaining fatty acid metabolism, is upregulated in Salmonella-infected macrophages. PPARδ deficiency dramatically inhibits Salmonella replication, which is linked to the metabolic state of macrophages and the level of intracellular glucose available to bacteria. Pharmacological activation of PPARδ increases glucose availability and enhances bacterial replication in macrophages and mice, while Salmonella fail to persist in Pparδ null mice. These data suggest that M2 macrophages represent a unique niche for long-term intracellular bacterial survival and link the PPARδ-regulated metabolic state of the host cell to persistent bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Virulence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) clinical isolates correlates with carriage of a 15 kb segment in the UL/b′ region of the viral genome, which is absent from attenuated strains. The mechanisms by which this segment contributes to HCMV virulence remain obscure. We observed that intergenic RNA sequences within the 15 kb segment function as a microRNA (miRNA) decay element (miRDE) and direct the selective, sequence-specific turnover of mature miR-17 and miR-20a encoded within the host miR-17-92 cluster. Unlike canonical miRNA-mRNA interactions, the miRNA-miRDE interactions did not repress miRDE expression. miRNA binding site mutations retargeted miRDE to other miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs, which are otherwise resistant to miRDE-mediated decay. miRDE function was required to accelerate virus production in the context of lytic HCMV infection. These results indicate a role for viral noncoding RNA in regulating cellular miRNAs during HCMV pathogenesis and suggest that noncoding RNAs may play a role in mature miRNA turnover.

Abstract: Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 5 (CRMP5) belongs to a family of five cytosolic proteins highly expressed in the developing nervous system but downregulated in the adult brain. When expressed at the adult stage, CRMP5 is involved in neurological disorders. Indeed, CRMP5 is found expressed in cancer cells of some brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, or in small cell lung cancer causing paraneoplastic neurological syndromes as a result of cancer-induced auto-immune processes. Nevertheless, its role in cancer pathology is still obscure. Here, we show a new short isoform, derived from C-terminal processing of CRMP5, presenting a nuclear localization both in human glioblastoma, and in cancer cell lines (H69, GL15). By mutational analysis, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation occurs via nuclear localization signal (NLS), where the essential residue for nuclear location is K391. Direct CRMP5/ tubulin interaction, previously shown during brain development, does not occur for cytosolic CRMP5 in pathological conditions, leading to the suggestion that in cancer cells CRMP5 is not sequestered in the cytosol; therefore it may undergo C-terminal truncation allowing the exposure of the NLS for active translocation. Moreover, we show that the function associated with the CRMP5 nuclear targeting is an increase of cell proliferation activity.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that multilayered periosteal sheets prepared from the explant culture of alveolar periosteum serve as a promising osteogenic grafting material in periodontal tissue regeneration. For the preparation of more potent periosteal sheets, we examined the applicability of stem-cell culture media. Compared to the control medium (Medium 199+10% FBS), periosteal sheets expanded with MesenPRO-RS™ medium exhibited these features: Cells grew three-dimensionally and deposited collagen in the extracellular spaces to form thicker multilayers of cells. Chondrocytic markers were not significantly upregulated. Contractile force was generated in proportion with the increased thickness of the periosteal sheets and the formation of cytoplasmic α-smooth muscle actin fibers. However, myofibroblastic markers were not significantly upregulated. The surface marker CD146 was substantially upregulated, while both CD73 and CD105 were downregulated. Alkaline phosphatase, a representative osteoblastic marker, was not upregulated by osteogenic induction. However, these expanded periosteal sheets exhibited substantially stronger osteogenic differentiation when implanted in nude mice. Therefore, despite our reservations, MesenPRO medium effectively expanded the cells contained in periosteal sheets to promote the formation of thicker multilayers of cells in vitro, and these enhanced periosteal sheets expressed increased osteogenic potential at implantation sites in vivo. In conjunction with data indicating that CD146-positive cells were notably expanded and the recently proposed concept that CD146 is a marker for osteogenic progenitor cells found in the bone marrow stroma, our findings suggest that MesenPRO medium improves the preparation of highly osteogenic periosteal sheets suitable for clinical application largely through the induction of CD146-positive cells.

Abstract: Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) is an inhibitor of many proteases in vitro, including the membrane-bound serine protease, matriptase. Studies of knock-out mice have shown that HAI-2 is essential for placental development only in mice expressing matriptase, suggesting that HAI-2 is important for regulation of matriptase. Previous studies have shown that recombinant expression of matriptase was unsuccessful unless co-expressed with another HAI, HAI-1. In the present study we show that when human matriptase is recombinantly expressed alone in the canine cell line MDCK, then human matriptase mRNA can be detected and the human matriptase ectodomain is shed to the media, suggesting that matriptase expressed alone is rapidly transported through the secretory pathway and shed. Whereas matriptase expressed together with HAI-1 or HAI-2 accumulates on the plasma membrane where it is activated, as judged by cleavage at Arg614 and increased peptidolytic activity of the cell extracts. Mutagenesis of Kunitz domain 1 but not Kunitz domain 2 abolished this function of HAI-2. HAI-2 seems to carry out its function intracellularly as this is where the vast majority of HAI-2 is located and since HAI-2 could not be detected on the basolateral plasma membrane where matriptase resides. However, minor amounts of HAI-2 not undergoing endocytosis could be detected on the apical plasma membrane. Our results suggest that Kunitz domain 1 of HAI-2 cause matriptase to accumulate in a membrane-bound form on the basolateral plasma membrane.

Abstract: Tumor cells exposed to sub-lethal photodynamic therapy (PDT) cause cellular rescue responses that lead to resistance to the therapy, including expression of angiogenic factors and survival molecules. However, the mechanisms contributing to the resistance are yet to be fully understood. Here, we show for the first time that Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, plays an important role in protecting cells from PDT-induced apoptosis. In contrast to the reduction in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, sub-lethal PDT induces an increase in Mcl-1 expression. Silencing Mcl-1 sensitizes tumor cells to PDT-induced apoptosis, and ectopic expression of Mcl-1 significantly delays Bax translocation to mitochondria and inhibits caspase-3 activity following PDT. Mcl-1 expression is associated closely with activated AKT signaling following PDT. AKT can regulate Mcl-1 expression through GSK-3β and NF-κB at the protein and transcriptional levels, respectively. Inhibition of AKT by Wortmannin or siRNA significantly reduces the levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein and enhances PDT-induced apoptosis. Treatment with Celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is shown to downregulate Mcl-1 expression, and enhances PDT-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. This down-regulation is closely related to the inhibition effect of Celecoxib on the AKT/GSK-3β pathway, and was blocked upon addition of GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These results suggest that Mcl-1 is a potential target for improving the antitumor efficiency of PDT. A loss in Mcl-1 by inhibiting AKT promotes PDT-induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. This also provides a novel rationale for utilizing Celecoxib to improve the efficacy of PDT.

Abstract: Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the first germ-line population that forms from the proximal epiblast of the developing embryo. Despite their biological importance, the regulatory networks whereby PGCs arise, migrate, and differentiate into gametes during embryonic development remains elusive, largely due to the limited number of germ cells in the early embryo. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern early germ cell development, we utilized an in vitro differentiation model of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and screened a series of candidate genes with specific expression in the adult reproductive organs. We discovered that gain of function of Gasz, a gene previously reported to participate in meiosis of postnatal spermatocytes, led to the most robust upregulation of PGC formation from both human and murine ESCs. In contrast, Gasz deficiency resulted in pronounced reduction of germ cells during ESC differentiation and decreased expression of MVH and DAZL in genital ridges during early embryonic development. Further analyses demonstrated that GASZ interacted with DAZL, a key germ cell regulator, to synergistically promote germ cell derivation from ESCs. Thus, our data reveal a potential role of GASZ during embryonic germ cell development and provide a powerful in vitro system for dissecting the molecular pathways in early germ cell formation during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Host defense to RNA viruses depends on rapid intracellular recognition of viral RNA by two cytoplasmic RNA helicases: RIG-I and MDA5. RNA transfection experiments indicate that RIG-I responds to naked double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) with a triphosphorylated 5′ (5′ppp) terminus. However, the identity of the RIG-I stimulating viral structures in an authentic infection context remains unresolved. We show that incoming viral nucleocapsids containing a 5′ppp dsRNA “panhandle” structure trigger antiviral signaling that commences with RIG-I, is mediated through the adaptor protein MAVS, and terminates with transcription factor IRF-3. Independent of mammalian cofactors or viral polymerase activity, RIG-I bound to viral nucleocapsids, underwent a conformational switch, and homo-oligomerized. Enzymatic probing and superresolution microscopy suggest that RIG-I interacts with the panhandle structure of the viral nucleocapsids. These results define cytoplasmic entry of nucleocapsids as the proximal RIG-I-sensitive step during infection and establish viral nucleocapsids with a 5′ppp dsRNA panhandle as a RIG-I activator.

Abstract: Upregulated ERK1/2 activity is often correlated with AKT activation during prostate cancer (PCa) progression, yet their functional relation needs elucidation. Using androgen-deprived LNCaP cells, in which ERK1/2 activation occurs in strong correlation with AKT activation, we found that AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation is necessary for ERK1/2 activation. Specifically, in response to androgen deprivation, AKT upregulated B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 without affecting A-Raf or C-Raf-1. This effect of AKT was abolished by Arg25 to Ala mutation or truncating (∆4-129) the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT, indicating that the canonical AKT regulation is important for this signaling. Intriguingly, although a constitutively active AKT containing N-terminal myristoylation signal could sufficiently upregulate B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 in LNCaP cells, subsequent MEK/ERK activation still required hormone deprivation. In contrast, AKT activity was sufficient to induce not only B-Raf phosphorylation but also MEK/ERK activation in the hormone refractory LNCaP variant, C4-2. These data indicate that androgen depletion may induce MEK/ERK activation through a synergy between AKT-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that the latter may become deregulated in association with castration resistance. In support, consistent AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation was also detected in a panel of PCa lines derived from the cPten−/− L mice before and after castration. Our results also demonstrate that AKT regulates androgen receptor levels partly via the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. This study reveals a novel crosstalk between ERK1/2 and AKT in PCa cells.

Abstract: Summary
Thiol-group oxidation of active and allosteric cysteines is a widespread regulatory posttranslational protein modification. Pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, use regulatory cysteine oxidation to respond to and overcome reactive oxygen species (ROS) encountered in the host environment. To obtain a proteome-wide view of oxidation-sensitive cysteines in these two pathogens, we employed a competitive activity-based protein profiling approach to globally quantify hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reactivity with cysteines across bacterial proteomes. We identified ∼200 proteins containing H2O2-sensitive cysteines, including metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, and uncharacterized proteins. Additional biochemical and genetic studies identified an oxidation-responsive cysteine in the master quorum-sensing regulator LasR and redox-regulated activities for acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ExaC, arginine deiminase ArcA, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Taken together, our data indicate that pathogenic bacteria exhibit a complex, multilayered response to ROS that includes the rapid adaption of metabolic pathways to oxidative-stress challenge.

Abstract: CD20, a membrane protein highly expressed on most B-cell lymphomas, is an effective target demonstrated in clinical practice for treating B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20. In this work, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to map the nanoscale distribution of CD20 molecules on the surface of cancer cells from clinical B-cell NHL patients under the assistance of ROR1 fluorescence recognition (ROR1 is a specific cell surface marker exclusively expressed on cancer cells). First, the ROR1 fluorescence labeling experiments showed that ROR1 was expressed on cancer cells from B-cell lymphoma patients, but not on normal cells from healthy volunteers. Next, under the guidance of ROR1 fluorescence, the rituximab-conjugated AFM tips were moved to cancer cells to image the cellular morphologies and detect the CD20-rituximab interactions on the cell surfaces. The distribution maps of CD20 on cancer cells were constructed by obtaining arrays of (16×16) force curves in local areas (500×500nm2) on the cell surfaces. The experimental results provide a new approach to directly investigate the nanoscale distribution of target protein on single clinical cancer cells.

Abstract: To circumvent the problems of genetic and environmental diversity hampering the analysis in humans, we turned to a murine model for human knee osteoarthritis (OA) and fine mapped a previously defined OA-quantitative trait locus (QTL). We here focused on one of the candidate genes within the OA-QTL encoding the Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled related protein 1 (Sfrp1). Sequence analysis of the Sfrp1 gene in the OA strain STR/ort revealed 23 polymorphic changes with a potential to alter the gene expression. Indeed, a reduced expression in STR/ort mice was demonstrated for articular chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes of the femoral growth plate as shown by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR of in vitro generated mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and chondrogenically differentiated MSC (cMSC) confirmed the reduced Sfrp1 expression in STR/ort mice. This reduced Sfrp1 expression in MSC correlated with an increased amount of cytoplasmic β-catenin, a downregulation of the Wnt target gene PPARγ and an upregulation of Runx2 as well as a preferential differentiation of the MSC along the osteoblasts lineage. Given the role of Wnt signalling during chondrogenesis and in maintaining the integrity of the long lived articular chondrocytes, we conclude from our results that the reduced Sfrp1 expression in STR/ort mice not only leads to an increased activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling early in life but also renders the articular cartilage prone to premature ageing and to the development of OA.

Abstract: The modulation of purinergic receptors plays an important role in the regulation of bone formation by the osteoblast. On the other hand, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, regulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor bone cells and stimulate bone formation. In this study, we investigate the effects of several nucleotides on osteoblast differentiation and function, and their relation with the gene expression of osteogenic proteins BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-5 as well as of differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Our results indicate that 100μM ATP, ATPγS and UTP, but not ADP, ADPβS or UDP, promote ALP activity in rat primary osteoblasts, showing a peak about day 7 of the treatment. ATP, ATPγS and UTP also increase the mRNA levels of ALP, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5 and BSP. Both the ALP activity and ALP and BMP-4 mRNA increments induced by ATP and UTP are inhibited by Ly294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in purinergic modulation of osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, bone mineralization enhance 1 and 1.5 fold after culturing osteoblasts in the presence of 100μM ATP or UTP, respectively, but not of ADP or UDP for 22 days. This information suggests that P2Y2 receptors (responsive to ATP, ATPγS and UTP) enhance osteoblast differentiation involving PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation and gene expression induction of ALP, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5 and BSP. Our findings state a novel molecular mechanism that involves specific gene expression activation of osteoblast function by the purinoreceptors, which would be of help in setting up new pharmacological strategies for the intervention in bone loss pathologies.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) preferentially migrate to the injured tissue but with limited efficiency. Here we investigated the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) treatment on the BMSC migration to the acute kidney injury (AKI) microenvironment. The possible mechanisms were also discussed. A hypoxia/re-oxygenation (HR) model of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) was established to generate AKI in vitro, and a chemotaxis experiment was conducted using the transwell chamber. EPO treatment enhanced the BMSC migration to the HR-RTEC culturing chamber in a SDF-1 level-dependent manner, which was fully inhibited by the treatment of anti-SDF-1 antibody. The BMSC migration could also be partly blocked by LY294002 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) and PD98059 (MAPK inhibitor). Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated MAPK in BMSCs were enhanced by EPO treatment. In the in vivo experiment, BMSCs were transplanted into the AKI mice and EPO was subcutaneously injected. The results showed that EPO injection increased the SDF-1 protein expression and BMSC accumulation in the renal tissue, which was consistent with a decent improvement of renal function. In addition, the BMSC accumulation in the renal tissue was blocked by anti-SDF-1 antibody, LY294002 or PD98059. Our data suggest that AKI microenvironment had a directional chemotactic effect on BMSCs, which could be further enhanced by the EPO treatment. The increased SDF-1 level in the AKI microenvironment and the activations of PI3K/AKT and MAPK in BMSCs were the possible mechanisms for the effect of EPO. Therefore, BMSC transplantation combined with EPO injection can be a novel and effective approach for AKI repair.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem (hES) cells can differentiate into cells of the three germ layers in vitro and serve as a powerful resource to study mechanisms involved in cell fate decisions. However, it is difficult to promote the directed and efficient differentiation of hES cells toward a specific lineage. Here we establish a stepwise strategy for generating hemato-endothelial and cardiac precursors from hES cells in single culture conditions. The efficiency of committing hES cells to three cell lineages was significantly higher with our approach than with exposure to single or multiple cytokines. Efficiency was determined using quantitative analysis by gene expression, flow cytometry, and colony assays. Several cytokines were sufficient to drive the efficient differentiation of hES cells into specific lineages. Each of these factors appeared to regulate specific steps of differentiation: BMP4 promoted the efficient formation of mesoderm; bFGF induced the differentiation of these mesodermal precursors to the hemangioblast fate; VEGF and TPO were required for the production of committed hematopoietic progenitors. This stepwise control of differentiation in vitro leads to a high frequency of hemato-endothelial and cardiac precursors derived from hES cells and offers a unique model for studying the molecular and cellular events that regulate hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis.

Abstract: Regulating the entry of secretory and membrane proteins into the ER is shown to be an important physiological process, in terms of controlling quantity, localization and therefore function of target proteins. However, few small molecule modulators are available to pharmacologically regulate translocation of a specific protein. Here, we identified a small molecule that specifically inhibits pathogenic PrP biosynthesis using a highly sensitive and reproducible assay based on the fluorogenic substrate reporter PrP. This molecule specifically destabilized the signal peptide of PrP, leading to cotranslational rerouting of a significant amount of nascent PrP to proteasome-dependent degradation pathway in the cytosol. This study suggests that regulating differential translocation efficiency attributable to sequence diversity in signal peptides of disease-causing secretory and membrane proteins using cell-permeable small molecules may be a potential therapeutic approach for diseases associated with impaired protein biogenesis.

Abstract: HtrA2(Omi), belonging to the high-temperature requirement A (HtrA) family of stress proteins, is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and in the stimulation of apoptosis, as well as in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The protein comprises a serine protease domain and a postsynaptic density of 95 kDa, disk large, and zonula occludens 1 (PDZ) regulatory domain and functions both as a protease and a chaperone. Based on the crystal structure of the HtrA2 inactive trimer, it has been proposed that PDZ domains restrict substrate access to the protease domain and that during protease activation there is a significant conformational change at the PDZ–protease interface, which removes the inhibitory effect of PDZ from the active site. The crystal structure of the HtrA2 active form is not available yet. HtrA2 activity markedly increases with temperature. To understand the molecular basis of this increase in activity, we monitored the temperature-induced structural changes using a set of single-Trp HtrA2 mutants with Trps located at the PDZ–protease interface. The accessibility of each Trp to aqueous medium was assessed by fluorescence quenching, and these results, in combination with mean fluorescence lifetimes and wavelength emission maxima, indicate that upon an increase in temperature the HtrA2 structure relaxes, the PDZ–protease interface becomes more exposed to the solvent, and significant conformational changes involving both domains occur at and above 30 °C. This conclusion correlates well with temperature-dependent changes of HtrA2 proteolytic activity and the effect of amino acid substitutions (V226K and R432L) located at the domain interface, on HtrA2 activity. Our results experimentally support the model of HtrA2 activation and provide an insight into the mechanism of temperature-induced changes in HtrA2 structure.

Abstract: Endothelial cells produce nitric oxide (NO) by activation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and transcription of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). We explored the effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a compound derived from chuanxiong, on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced iNOS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and explored the signal pathways involved by using RT-PCR and Western blot. TMP suppressed TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS by inhibiting IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation, IκB degradation and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation, which were required for NO gene transcription. Exposure to wortmannin abrogated IKK/IκB/NF-κB-mediated iNOS expression, suggesting activation of such a signal pathway might be phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) dependent. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor piceatannol significantly inhibited NO production. Furthermore, piceatannol obviously suppressed TNF-α-induced IκB phosphorylation and the downstream NF-κB activation, suggesting that Syk is an upstream key regulator in the activation of PI3K/IKK/IκB-mediated signaling. TMP significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of Syk and PI3K. Our data indicate that TMP might repress iNOS expression, at least in part, through its inhibitory effect of Syk-mediated PI3K phosphorylation in TNF-α-stimulated HUVECs.

Abstract: Expression of antibody fragments in mammalian cells (intrabodies) is used to probe the target protein or interfere with its biological function. We previously described the in vitro characterisation of a single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment (F5) isolated from an intrabody library that binds to the oncoprotein gankyrin (GK) in solution. Here, we have isolated several other scFvs that interact with GK in the presence of F5 and tested whether they allow, when fused to fluorescent proteins, to detect by FRET endogenous GK in living cells. The binding of pairs of scFvs to GK was analysed by gel filtration and the ability of each scFv to mediate nuclear import/export of GK was determined. Binding between scFv-EGFP and RFP-labelled GK in living cells was detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). After co-transfection of two scFvs fused to EGFP and RFP, respectively, which form a tri-molecular complex with GK in vitro, FRET signal was measured. This system allowed us to observe that GK is monomeric and distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of several cancer cell lines. Our results show that pairs of fluorescently labelled intrabodies can be monitored by FLIM–FRET microscopy and that this technique allows the detection of lowly expressed endogenous proteins in single living cells.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a major role in the transport and metabolism of lipid. Other functions of ApoE include modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The expression of ApoE in osteoblasts and its relevance with bone formation have also been reported. However, the effect of ApoE on osteoclasts has not yet been examined. Here, we investigated the role of ApoE in osteoclast differentiation using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and RAW264.7 cells. We found a down-regulation of ApoE gene expression during osteoclastic differentiation of those cells. Overexpression of ApoE in BMMs and RAW264.7 cells significantly blocked the induction of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cell c1 (NFATc1), transcription factors critical for expression of osteoclast marker genes, by receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), the osteoclast differentiation factor. ApoE inhibited osteoclast differentiation, as measured by decreased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinuclear cells (MNCs). In addition, ApoE reduced the expression of dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) and ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 38kDa, V0 subunit d2 (ATP6v0d2), genes involved in cell–cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis. Knock-down of ApoE using a specific siRNA promoted the RANKL-mediated induction of osteoclast differentiation. While ApoE did not affect the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways by RANKL, the phosphorylation of p65 trans-activation domain on serine 536 and transcription activity of NF-κB were reduced by ApoE overexpression. These findings suggest that ApoE plays an inhibitory role in osteoclast differentiation via the suppression of RANKL-dependent activation of NF-κB and induction of c-Fos and NFATc1.

Abstract: Invadolysin is an essential, conserved metalloprotease which links cell division with cell migration and is intriguingly associated with lipid droplets. In this work we examine the expression pattern, protein localisation and gross anatomical consequences of depleting invadolysin in the teleost Danio rerio. We observe that invadolysin plays a significant role in cell migration during development. When invadolysin is depleted by targeted morpholino injection, the appropriate deposition of neuromast clusters and distribution of melanophores are both disrupted. We also observe that blood vessels generated via angiogenesis are affected in invadolysin morphant fish while those formed by vasculogenesis appear normal, demonstrating an unanticipated role for invadolysin in vessel formation. Our results thus highlight a common feature shared by, and a requirement for invadolysin in, these distinct morphological events dependent on cell migration.

Abstract: In vitro erythropoiesis has been studied extensively for its application in the manufacture of transfusable erythrocytes. Unfortunately, culture conditions have not been as effective as in vivo growth conditions, where bone marrow macrophages are known to be a key regulator of erythropoiesis. This study focused on the fact that some erythroblasts are detached from macrophages and only contact other erythroblasts. We hypothesized that additional factors regulate erythroblasts, likely through either physical contact or secreted factors. To further elucidate these critical factors, human erythroblasts derived from cord blood were cultured at high density to mimic marrow conditions. This growth condition resulted in a significantly increased erythroid enucleation rate and viability. We found several novel contact-related signals in erythroblasts: intercellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM-4) and deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1). DLC-1, a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, has not previously been reported in erythroid cells, but its interaction with ICAM-4 was demonstrated here. We further confirmed the presence of a secreted form of human ICAM-4 for the first time. When soluble ICAM-4 was added to media, cell viability and enucleation increased with decreased nuclear dysplasia, suggesting that ICAM-4 is a key factor in contact between cells. These results highlight potential new mechanisms for autonomous control of erythropoiesis. The application of these procedures to erythrocyte manufacturing could enhance in vitro erythrocyte production for clinical use.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immune receptors, notably Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), sense viral infection and activate transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), to induce type I interferon (IFN). We demonstrate that the lipid phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) is increased upon viral infection and facilitates type I IFN production by binding to IRF3 and its upstream kinase TBK1 and promoting TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation and activation. Additionally, we determine that PtdIns5P is produced through the kinase PIKfyve, which phosphorylates PtdIns to generate PtdIns5P. Accordingly, PIKfyve knockdown or pharamoclogical inhibition decreases PtdIns5P levels and type I IFN production after TLR or RLR stimulation, and results in increased viral replication. A synthetic PtdIns5P, C8-PtdIns5P, promotes IRF3 phosphorylation and cytokine production in dendritic cells and acts as an adjuvant to boost immune responses in immunized mice. Thus, PtdIns5P produced during viral infection is a second messenger that targets the TBK1-IRF3 axis to elicit antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Fibroblasts incubated on 3D collagen matrices in serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-containing medium self-organize into clusters through a mechanism that requires cell contraction. However, in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-containing medium, cells migrate as individuals and do not form clusters even though they constantly encounter each other. Here, we present evidence that a required function of cell contraction in clustering is formation of fibronectin (FN) fibrillar matrix. We found that in serum or LPA but not in PDGF or basal medium, cells organized FN (both serum and cellular) into a fibrillar, detergent-insoluble matrix. Cell clusters developed concomitant with FN matrix formation. FN fibrils accumulated beneath cells and along the borders of cell clusters in regions of cell–matrix tension. Blocking Rho kinase or myosin II activity prevented FN matrix assembly and cell clustering. Using siRNA silencing and function-blocking antibodies and peptides, we found that cell clustering and FN matrix assembly required α5β1 integrins and fibronectin. Cells were still able to exert contractile force and compact the collagen matrix under the latter conditions, which showed that contraction was not sufficient for cell clustering to occur. Our findings provide new insights into how procontractile (serum/LPA) and promigratory (PDGF) growth factor environments can differentially regulate FN matrix assembly by fibroblasts interacting with collagen matrices and thereby influence mesenchymal cell morphogenetic behavior under physiologic circumstances such as wound repair, morphogenesis and malignancy.

Abstract: Considerable evidence has been published demonstrating the importance of lipoxygenase enzymes for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. The current study sets out to determine whether or not 12-lipoxygenase (12LO) is also important for human placental VSMC survival. Both a pharmacological and two 12LO antisense knockdown approaches were applied. The 12LO inhibitor baicalien induced a 2–2.5-fold increase in cell death, which appeared to result from apoptosis, as indicated by DNA fragmentation, activation of procaspase 3 to caspase 3 and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria to the cytosol. This apoptosis could be prevented by treatment with the 12LO product, 12 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12HETE). Human platelet-type 12LO-antisense knockdown, by either plasmid transfection or adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection also induced substantial VSMC death over controls, which could also be prevented by treatment with 12HETE, but not 5HETE. Hence, biochemical 12LO inhibition or 12LO-antisense knockdown in VSMC can induce programmed cell death. These observations suggest a previously unrecognized association between human VSMC survivability and 12LO.

Abstract: Summary
Human influenza A virus (IAV) vaccination is limited by “antigenic drift,” rapid antibody-driven escape reflecting amino acid substitutions in the globular domain of hemagglutinin (HA), the viral attachment protein. To better understand drift, we used anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal Abs (mAbs) to sequentially select IAV escape mutants. Twelve selection steps, each resulting in a single amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin globular domain, were required to eliminate antigenicity defined by monoclonal or polyclonal Abs. Sequential mutants grow robustly, showing the structural plasticity of HA, although several hemagglutinin substitutions required an epistatic substitution in the neuraminidase glycoprotein to maximize growth. Selecting escape mutants from parental versus sequential variants with the same mAb revealed distinct escape repertoires, attributed to contextual changes in antigenicity and the mutation landscape. Since each hemagglutinin mutation potentially sculpts future mutation space, drift can follow many stochastic paths, undermining its unpredictability and underscoring the need for drift-insensitive vaccines.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is a vital process for proper embryonic development, wound healing, malignant tumor growth and metastasis. Two glia maturation factor genes, glia maturation factor-β (GMFB) and glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG), presenting different expression patterns and distinct biological functions are found in vertebrates. But, the role of GMFB and GMFG in vascular development remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that both GMFB and GMFG are highly conserved in vertebrates. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR results revealed that GMFB and GMFG were differently expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis. GMFB was highly enriched in brain and GMFG was predominantly expressed in endothelial cells. By gene specific MO, knockdown of GMFG, but not GMFB, severely disrupted angiogenic sprouting of intersegmental vessels (ISVs), but this angiogenic defects were prevented by overexpression of a MO-resistant form of zebrafish GMFG mRNA. In addition, the expressions of angiogenic factors VEGF-A, STAT3, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13 were significantly decreased in endothelial cells of GMFG morphants. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that GMFG is an important regulator for angiogenic sprouting during angiogenesis in zebrafish and suggest that GMFG may act as a novel potential target for anti-angiogenesis therapy in clinical settings.

Abstract: Vascular injury and destruction of endothelial cells (ECs) are the early events in scleroderma (SSc) patients. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs) to treat SSc. We have assessed the functional differentiation of hiPSC-ECs and compared them with human embryonic stem cell-derived ECs (hESC-ECs) by a variety of in vitro experimental approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of hiPSC-ECs in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model. Our results demonstrated that hiPSC-ECs and hESC-ECs showed similar maximum expressions of FLK1 (early EC marker) at day five during differentiation. After sorting and culturing, the FLK1-positive cells exhibited spindle and subsequent endothelial cobblestone morphology in EGM2 medium. The hESC-ECs and hiPSC-ECs also expressed late EC markers CD31 (68% and 75%), CD144 (50% and 61%), CD146 (46% and 61%), and DiI-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-ac-LDL) uptake (55% and 63%), respectively. They additionally formed capillary-like structures on Matrigel. Analyses of the transplantation of sorted CD31-positive hiPSC-ECs into the bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model demonstrated that these cells participate in recovery of the damaged vessels. There was a reduction in collagen content; the number of total and degranulated mast cells returned to their normal state, and bleomycin-induced wounds as well as skin fibrosis improved four weeks after transplantation of hiPSC-ECs. Our findings have shown that the differentiation process from hESCs and hiPSCs to vascular cell components is similar. Additionally, this is the first study to determine the therapeutic potential of vascular cells from hiPSCs in the treatment of an SSc model. In the future, with further validation, these may be used as an appropriate source for the treatment of SSc patients.

Abstract: Migration-stimulating factor (MSF), an oncofetal truncated isoform of fibronectin, is a potent stimulator of cell invasion. However, its distribution and motogenic role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have never been identified. In this study, real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) were performed to detect MSF mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissues and matched adjacent tumor-free tissues. Furthermore, to examine the effect of MSF on invasiveness, MSF was upregulated in A549 cells. The invasiveness and viability of A549 cells were then determined using a transwell migration assay and the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assays, respectively. The expression level of MSF in NSCLC tissue was markedly higher than in matched adjacent tumor-free tissue. Additionally, the level of MSF protein expression in stage III and IV NSCLC samples was higher than in stage I and II NSCLC samples. More importantly, we also demonstrated that migration and invasion of A549 cells increased substantially after upregulating MSF, although proliferation remained unchanged. Meanwhile, we found no correlation between increasing motility and invasiveness of MSF-overexpressing cells and expression levels and activities of matrix metalloprotease MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our current study shows that MSF plays a role in migration and invasion of A549 cells and suggests that MSF may be a potential biomarker of NSCLC progression.

Abstract: In the present study an in vitro bilayer model system of the pulmonary alveolocapillary barrier was established to investigate the role of the microvascular endothelium on re-epithelialization. The model system, confluent monolayer cultures on opposing sides of a porous membrane, consisted of a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HPMEC-ST1.6R) and an alveolar type II like cell line (A549), stably expressing EGFP and mCherry, respectively. These fluorescent proteins allowed the real time assessment of the integrity of the monolayers and the automated analysis of the wound healing process after a scratch injury. The HPMECs significantly attenuated the speed of re-epithelialization, which was associated with the proximity to the A549 layer. Examination of cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs of the model system revealed protrusions through the membrane pores and close contact between the A549 cells and the HPMECs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that these close contacts consisted of heterocellular gap-, tight- and adherens-junctions. Additional analysis, using a fluorescent probe to assess gap-junctional communication, revealed that the HPMECs and A549 cells were able to exchange the fluorophore, which could be abrogated by disrupting the gap junctions using connexin mimetic peptides. These data suggest that the pulmonary microvascular endothelium may impact the re-epithelialization process.

Abstract: Co-culture of periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLs) and SCC-25 oral squamous carcinoma cells (OSCC) results in conversion of PDLs into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and induces epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OSCC tumor cells. We hypothesized that Curcumin targets this dynamic mutual interaction between CAFs and tumor cells. Normal and 2μM Curcumin-treated co-culture were performed for 4 days, followed by analysis of tumor cell invasivity, mRNA/protein expression of EMT-markers and mediators, activity measure of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and western blot analysis of signal transduction in tumor cells and fibroblasts. In Curcumin-treated co-culture, in tumor cells, the levels of nuclear factor κB (NFκBα) and early response kinase (ERK)—decreased, in fibroblasts, integrin αv protein synthesis decreased compared to corresponding cells in normal co-culture. The signal modulatory changes induced by Curcumin caused decreased release of EMT-mediators in CAFs and reversal of EMT in tumor cells, which was associated with decreased invasion. These data confirm the palliative potential of Curcumin in clinical application.

Abstract: The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase PMK-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans has been associated with heavy metal, oxidative and pathogen stress. Pmk-1 is part of an operon comprising three p38 homologues, with pmk-1 expression suggested to be regulated by the operon promoter. There are contradictory reports about the cellular localization of PMK-1. We were interested to study principles of pmk-1 expression and to analyze the role of PMK-1 under heat stress. Using a translational GFP reporter, we found pmk-1 expression to be driven by a promoter in front of pmk-1. PMK-1 was detected in intestinal cells and neurons, with a cytoplasmic localization at moderate temperature. Increasing temperature above 32 °C, however, induced a nuclear translocation of PMK-1 as well as PMK-1 accumulation near to apical membranes. Testing survival rates revealed 34–35°C as critical temperature range, where short-term survival severely decreased. Mutants of the PMK-1 pathway (pmk-1Δ, sek-1Δ, mek-1Δ) as well as a mutant of JNK pathway (jnk-1Δ) showed significantly lower survival rates than wild-type or mutants of other pathways (kgb-1Δ, daf-2Δ). Rescue and overexpression experiments verified the negative effects of pmk-1Δ on heat tolerance. Studying gene expression by RNA-seq and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed positive effects of the PMK-1 pathway on the expression of genes for chaperones, protein biosynthesis, protein degradation, and other functional categories. Thus, the PMK-1 pathway is involved in the heat stress responses of C. elegans, possibly by a PMK-1-mediated activation of the transcription factor SKN-1 and/or an indirect or direct PMK-1-dependent activation (hyperphosphorylation) of heat-shock factor 1.

Abstract: Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose morphology is regulated by a complex balance of fission and fusion processes, and we still know relatively little about how mitochondrial dynamics is regulated. MIEF1 (also called MiD51) has recently been characterized as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and in this report we explore the functions of its paralog MIEF2 (also called MiD49), to learn to what extent MIEF2 is functionally distinct from MIEF1. We show that MIEF1 and MIEF2 have many functions in common. Both are anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane, recruit Drp1 from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial surface and cause mitochondrial fusion, and MIEF2, like MIEF1, can interact with Drp1 and hFis1. MIEF1 and MIEF2, however, also differ in certain aspects. MIEF1 and MIEF2 are differentially expressed in human tissues during development. When overexpressed, MIEF2 exerts a stronger fusion-promoting effect than MIEF1, and in line with this, hFis1 and Mff can only partially revert the MIEF2-induced fusion phenotype, whereas MIEF1-induced fusion is reverted to a larger extent by hFis1 and Mff. MIEF2 forms high molecular weight oligomers, while MIEF1 is largely present as a dimer. Furthermore, MIEF1 and MIEF2 use distinct domains for oligomerization: in MIEF1, the region from amino acid residues 109–154 is required, whereas oligomerization of MIEF2 depends on amino acid residues 1 to 49, i.e. the N-terminal end. We also show that oligomerization of MIEF1 is not required for its mitochondrial localization and interaction with Drp1. In conclusion, our data suggest that the mitochondrial regulators MIEF1 and MIEF2 exert partially distinct functions in mitochondrial dynamics.

PPARα agonist fenofibrate attenuates TNF-α-induced CD40 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via the SIRT1-dependent signaling pathway,

Abstract: The ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) participates in the regulation of cellular inflammation. More recent studies indicated that sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, regulates the inflammatory response in adipocytes. However, whether the role of PPARα in inflammation is mediated by SIRT1 remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PPARα agonist fenofibrate on the expressions of SIRT1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine CD40 and underlying mechanisms in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that fenofibrate inhibited CD40 expression and up-regulated SIRT1 expression in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated adipocytes, and these effects of fenofibrate were reversed by PPARα antagonist GW6471. Moreover, SIRT1 inhibitors sirtinol/nicotinamide (NAM) or knockdown of SIRT1 could attenuate the effect of fenofibrate on TNF-α-induced CD40 expression in adipocytes. Importantly, NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) augmented the effect of fenofibrate on CD40 expression in adipocytes. Further study found that fenofibrate decreased the expression of acetylated-NF-κB p65 (Ac-NF-κB p65) in TNF-α-stimulated adipocytes, and the effect of fenofibrate was abolished by SIRT1 inhibition. In addition, fenofibrate up-regulated SIRT1 expression through AMPK in TNF-α-stimulated adipocytes. Taken together, these findings indicate that PPARα agonist fenofibrate inhibits TNF-α-induced CD40 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via the SIRT1-dependent signaling pathway.

Abstract: Most chemotherapeutics harm normal cells causing severe side effects and induce the development of resistance in cancer cells. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), recognized as anti-cancer agents, may overcome these limitations. The most studied mechanism underlying multi-drug resistance (MDR) is the over-expression of cell membrane transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which extrudes a variety of hydrophobic drugs. Additionally, P-gp contributes to cell membrane composition and increases the net negative charge on cell surface. We postulated that NK-lysin derived cationic peptide NK-2 might discriminate and preferentially eliminate P-gp over-expressing cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we employed MDR non-small cell lung carcinoma (NCI-H460/R) and colorectal carcinoma (DLD1-TxR) cell lines with high P-gp expression. MDR cancer cells that survived NK-2 treatment had decreased P-gp expression and were more susceptible to doxorubicin. We found that NK-2 more readily eliminated P-gp high-expressing cells. Acting in ‘carpet-like’ manner NK-2 co-localized with P-gp on the MDR cancer cell membrane. The inhibition of P-gp reduced the NK-2 effect in MDR cancer cells and, vice versa, NK-2 decreased P-gp transport activity. In conclusion, NK-2 could modulate MDR in unique way, eliminating the P-gp high-expressing cells from heterogeneous cancers and making them more vulnerable to classical drug treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Direct reprogramming of adult somatic cells into alternative cell types has been shown for several lineages. We previously showed that GATA4, MEF2C, and TBX5 (GMT) directly reprogrammed nonmyocyte mouse heart cells into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) in vitro and in vivo. However, GMT alone appears insufficient in human fibroblasts, at least in vitro. Here, we show that GMT plus ESRRG and MESP1 induced global cardiac gene-expression and phenotypic shifts in human fibroblasts derived from embryonic stem cells, fetal heart, and neonatal skin. Adding Myocardin and ZFPM2 enhanced reprogramming, including sarcomere formation, calcium transients, and action potentials, although the efficiency remained low. Human iCM reprogramming was epigenetically stable. Furthermore, we found that transforming growth factor β signaling was important for, and improved the efficiency of, human iCM reprogramming. These findings demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed toward the cardiac lineage, and lay the foundation for future refinements in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) is a highly conserved stress protein and target of self-reactive T cells in various inflammatory diseases. Not much is known about a possible role in atopic disease. As atopic diseases are considered to be the result of a disturbance in the balance between T helper cells type 2 and regulatory T cells, it is of interest to know whether hsp60 acts as a bystander antigen in atopic disease. Our aim was to investigate whether hsp60 is involved in the chronicity of inflammation of atopic dermatitis (AD). We studied the expression of hsp60 in skin tissue of adults with AD by immunohistochemistry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of children with AD were cultured with hsp60 and proliferative responses, cytokine secretion, surface markers, and functional assays were compared to responses of PBMC of healthy controls (HC). Hsp60 was detected more in lesional skin of AD patients compared to nonlesional skin. Furthermore, PBMC of children with AD proliferated more strongly in response to hsp60 compared to HC. hsp60-reactive T cells of atopic children produced high levels of IFNγ and low levels of IL-10. In vitro activation with hsp60 leads to the induction of CD4+CD25bright T cells expressing FOXP3 in both HC as well as in atopic children. However, despite their regulatory phenotype, hsp60-induced CD4+CD25brightCD127−FOXP3+ T cells of AD patients were incapable of suppressing effector T cells in vitro. hsp60 is recognized by proinflammatory (IFNγ high, IL-10 low) T cells in atopic patients and is more present in lesional AD skin. This suggests that hsp60-specific T cell responses contribute to local inflammation in AD.

Abstract: Summary
CERK1 is a lysine motif-containing plant pattern recognition receptor for chitin and peptidoglycan. Chitin recognition by OsCERK1 triggers rapid engagement of a rice MAP kinase cascade, which leads to defense response activation. How the MAP kinase cascades are engaged downstream of OsCERK1 remains obscure. Searching for host proteins that interact with Xoo1488, an effector of the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae, we identified the rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, OsRLCK185. Silencing OsRLCK185 suppressed peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immune responses, including MAP kinase activation and defense-gene expression. In response to chitin, OsRLCK185 associates with, and is directly phosphorylated by, OsCERK1 at the plasma membrane. Xoo1488 inhibits peptidoglycan- and chitin-induced immunity and pathogen resistance. Additionally, OsCERK1-mediated phosphorylation of OsRLCK185 is suppressed by Xoo1488, resulting in the inhibition of chitin-induced MAP kinase activation. These data support a role for OsRLCK185 as an essential immediate downstream signaling partner of OsCERK1 in mediating chitin- and peptidoglycan-induced plant immunity.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors mediate transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by estrogen (E2). Here we report that the amount of intracellular EGFR remains elevated after stimulation of MCF-7 cells with E2 and S1P, although membrane-localized EGFR and S1P3 receptors are quickly internalized. Co-localization of internalized EGFR and LAMP-2 was lower in cells treated with E2/S1P, suggesting that endosomal EGFR might be directed for recycling instead of degradation. In addition, we found that E2/S1P activated Cdc42 and that knockdown of Cdc42 restores fast EGFR degradation after E2/S1P stimulation. Inhibition of S1P3 receptors prevented E2-induced activation of Cdc42, supporting the important role of the S1P receptor in E2 signaling. This is a novel mechanism further defining the effect of E2/S1P on the EGFR transactivation in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway responsible for delivery of cytoplasmic material into the lysosomal degradation pathway to enable vesicular exocytosis. Interleukin (IL)-2 is produced by T-cells and its activity is important for immunoregulation. Fibroblasts are an immune competent cell type, playing a critical role in wound healing, chronic inflammation, and tumor development. Although autophagy plays an important role in each of these processes, whether it regulates IL-2 activity in fibroblasts is unknown. Here, we show that autophagy is required for IL-2-induced cell growth in fibroblasts. IL-2 significantly induced autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and primary lung fibroblasts. Autophagy inhibitors (e.g., 3-methylamphetamine and bafilomycin A1) or knockdown of ATG5 and beclin 1 blocked clinical grade IL-2-induced autophagy. Moreover, IL-2 induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation in MEFs and promoted interaction between HMGB1 and beclin1, which is required for autophagy induction. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy inhibited IL-2-induced cell proliferation and enhanced IL-2-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that autophagy is an important pro-survival regulator for IL-2-induced cell growth in fibroblasts.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death in the USA. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), including core components SUZ12 and EZH2, represents a key epigenetic regulator of digestive epithelial cell physiology and was previously shown to promote deleterious effects in a number of human cancers, including colon. Using colon cancer stem cells (CCSC) isolated from human primary colorectal tumors, we demonstrate that SUZ12 knockdown and treatment with DZNep, one of the most potent EZH2 inhibitors, increase apoptosis levels, marked by decreased Akt phosphorylation, in CCSCs, while embryonic stem (ES) cell survival is not affected. Moreover, DZNep treatments lead to increased PTEN expression in these highly tumorigenic cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity may constitute a new, epigenetic therapeutic strategy to target highly tumorigenic and metastatic colon cancer stem cells.

Abstract: In this paper, two-dimensional flow field simulation was conducted to determine shear stresses and velocity profiles for bone tissue engineering in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWVB). In addition, in vitro three-dimensional fabrication of tissue-engineered bones was carried out in optimized bioreactor conditions, and in vivo implantation using fabricated bones was performed for segmental bone defects of Zelanian rabbits. The distribution of dynamic pressure, total pressure, shear stress, and velocity within the culture chamber was calculated for different scaffold locations. According to the simulation results, the dynamic pressure, velocity, and shear stress around the surface of cell-scaffold construction periodically changed at different locations of the RWVB, which could result in periodical stress stimulation for fabricated tissue constructs. However, overall shear stresses were relatively low, and the fluid velocities were uniform in the bioreactor. Our in vitro experiments showed that the number of cells cultured in the RWVB was five times higher than those cultured in a T-flask. The tissue-engineered bones grew very well in the RWVB. This study demonstrates that stress stimulation in an RWVB can be beneficial for cell/bio-derived bone constructs fabricated in an RWVB, with an application for repairing segmental bone defects.

Abstract: Summary
The fetal liver kinase 1 (FLK-1)+ hemangioblast can generate hematopoietic, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). ER71/ETV2, GATA2, and SCL form a core transcriptional network in hemangioblast development. Transient coexpression of these three factors during mesoderm formation stage in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) robustly enhanced hemangioblast generation by activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and FLK-1 signaling while inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, WNT signaling, and cardiac output. Moreover, etsrp, gata2, and scl inhibition converted hematopoietic field of the zebrafish anterior lateral plate mesoderm to cardiac. FLK-1+ hemangioblasts generated by transient coexpression of the three factors (ER71-GATA2-SCL [EGS]-induced FLK-1+) effectively produced hematopoietic, endothelial, and SMCs in culture and in vivo. Importantly, EGS-induced FLK-1+ hemangioblasts, when codelivered with mesenchymal stem cells as spheroids, were protected from apoptosis and generated functional endothelial cells and SMCs in ischemic mouse hindlimbs, resulting in improved blood perfusion and limb salvage. ESC-derived, EGS-induced FLK-1+ hemangioblasts could provide an attractive cell source for future hematopoietic and vascular repair and regeneration.

Abstract: Gender differences have been described in osteoporosis with females having a higher risk of osteoporosis than males. The differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into bone or fat is a critical step for osteoporosis. Here we demonstrated that loss of the androgen receptor (AR) in BMSCs suppressed osteogenesis but promoted adipogenesis. The mechanism dissection studies revealed that AR deficiency suppressed osteogenesis-related genes to inhibit osteoblast differentiation from BMSCs. Knockout of AR promoted adipogenesis of BMSCs via Akt activation through IGFBP3-mediated IGF signaling, and the 5′ promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further proved that AR could modulate IGFBP3 expression at the transcriptional level. Finally, addition of IGF inhibitors successfully masked the AR deficiency-induced Akt activation, and inhibitions of Akt, IGF1, and IGF2 pathways reversed the AR depletion effects on the adipogenesis process. These results suggested that AR-mediated changes in IGFBP3 might modulate the IGF–Akt axis to regulate adipogenesis in BMSCs.

Polyamine and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A crosstalk in human colon and liver cancer,

Abstract: Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is an essential enzyme that is responsible for the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal methyl donor and precursor of polyamines. MAT1A is expressed in normal liver and MAT2A is expressed in all extrahepatic tissues. MAT2A expression is increased in human colon cancer and in colon cancer cells treated with mitogens, whereas silencing MAT2A resulted in apoptosis. The aim of the current work was to examine the mechanism responsible for MAT2A-dependent growth and apoptosis. We found that in RKO (human adenocarcinoma cell line) cells, MAT2A siRNA treatment lowered cellular SAMe and putrescine levels by 70–75%, increased apoptosis and inhibited growth. Putrescine supplementation blunted significantly MAT2A siRNA-induced apoptosis and growth suppression. Putrescine treatment (100pmol/L) raised MAT2A mRNA level to 4.3-fold of control, increased the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos and binding to an AP-1 site in the human MAT2A promoter and the promoter activity. In human colon cancer specimens, the expression levels of MAT2A, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), c-Jun and c-Fos are all elevated as compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Overexpression of ODC in RKO cells also raised MAT2A mRNA level and MAT2A promoter activity. ODC and MAT2A are also overexpressed in liver cancer and consistently, similar MAT2A-ODC-putrescine interactions and effects on growth and apoptosis were observed in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, there is a crosstalk between polyamines and MAT2A. Increased MAT2A expression provides more SAMe for polyamines biosynthesis; increased polyamine (putrescine in this case) can activate MAT2A at the transcriptional level. This along with increased ODC expression in cancer all feed forward to further enhance the proliferative capacity of the cancer cell.

Abstract: The existence and identification of adult renal stem cells is a controversial issue. In this study, renal stem cells were identified from cultures of clonal human nephrospheres. The cultured nephrospheres exhibited the activation of stem cell pathways and contained cells at different levels of maturation. In each nephrosphere the presence of 1.12–1.25 cells mirroring stem cell properties was calculated. The nephrosphere cells were able to generate three-dimensional tubular structures in 3D cultures and in vivo. In clonal human nephrospheres a PKHhigh phenotype was isolated using PKH26 epifluorescence, which can identify quiescent cells within the nephrospheres. The PKHhigh cells, capable of self-renewal and of generating a differentiated epithelial, endothelial and podocytic progeny, can also survive in vivo maintaining the undifferentiated status. The PKHhigh status, together with a CD133+/CD24− phenotype, identified a homogeneous cell population displaying in vitro self-renewal and multipotency capacity. The resident adult renal stem cell population isolated from nephrospheres can be used for the study of mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation in adult renal tissue as well as in renal pathological conditions.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive memory and cognitive decline due to the selective neuronal loss in the cortex and hippocampus of the brains. Generation of human induced pluoripotent stem (hiPS) cells holds great promise for disease modeling and drug discovery in AD. In this study, we used neurons with forebrain marker expression from two unrelated hiPS cell lines. As both populations of neurons were vulnerable to β-amyloid 1–42 (Aβ1–42) aggregates, a hallmark of AD pathology, we used them to investigate cellular mediators of Aβ1–42 toxicity. We observed in neurons differentiated from both hiPS cell lines that Aβ induced toxicity correlated with cell cycle re-entry and was inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors or shRNAs against Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). As one of the hiPS cell lines has been developed commercially to supply large quantities of differentiated neurons (iCell® Neurons), we screened a chemical library containing several hundred compounds and discovered several small molecules as effective blockers against Aβ1–42 toxicity, including a Cdk2 inhibitor. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an Aβ toxicity screen using hiPS cell-derived neurons. This study provided an excellent example of how hiPS cells can be used for disease modeling and high-throughput compound screening for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) has recently been suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. Its functional relevance was assessed by exploring structural and tumorigenic properties of lung cancer A549 cells stably transduced with retrovirus containing pre-miR-1. A549 cells overexpressing miR-1 exhibited a significant morphological change from a mesenchymal to an epithelial phenotype characterized by cell polarization and intercellular junctions. The cells showed increased expression of E-cadherin, which colocalized with cortical actin filaments and vinculin to form typical adherens junction at the apical regions of intercellular borders. Additionally, they exhibited occludin-positive tight junctions at similar apical regions. Moreover, their migratory and invasive activities were inhibited, and their sensitivity to doxorubicin was increased slightly compared to control mock-infected cells. These structural and tumorigenic properties induced by miR-1 were associated with the reduced expression of Slug, which was a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin or an inducer of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistently, Slug was identified as a miR-1 target by bioinformatics and a luciferase reporter assay with plasmids containing luciferase-Slug 3′UTR. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that re-expression of miR-1 may be an effective therapy that prevents cancer malignancy by converting cells from a mesenchymal phenotype to an epithelial phenotype via the downregulation of Slug.

Abstract: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a binding receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Binding of HCV envelope protein E2 to target cells is a prerequisite to DC-SIGN-mediated signaling. Using cell lines with stable or transient expression of DC-SIGN, we investigated effects of soluble HCV E2 protein on ERK pathway. MEK and ERK are activated by the E2 in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing DC-SIGN. Treatment of the cells with antibody to DC-SIGN results in inhibition of the E2 binding as well as the E2-induced MEK and ERK activation. In HEK293T cells transiently expressing DC-SIGN, activation of MEK and ERK is also induced by the E2. Activation of ERK pathway by HCV E2 through DC-SIGN provides useful information for understanding cellular receptor-mediated signaling.

Abstract: Background
Esophageal fibrosis is a complication of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) which has been attributed to both subepithelial fibrosis and to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal features. Common to both causes of EoE-fibrosis is the notion that granulocyte-derived TGF-β, induces myofibroblast differentiation of the target cell. To date, the role of esophageal epithelial cells as effector cells in esophageal fibrosis has never been explored. Herein, we investigated consequences of cross-talk between esophageal epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and identified profibrotic cytokines which influence the development of EMT in vitro.
Methods and results
Stimulation of primary fetal esophageal fibroblasts (FEF3) with conditioned media (CEM) from esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT), primed FEF3 cells to secrete IL-1β and TNFα, but not TGFβ. To determine whether these cytokines signaled in a paracrine fashion to esophageal epithelial cells, FEF3 cells were stimulated with CEM, followed by transfer of this fibroblast conditioned media (FCM) to EPC2-hTERT cells. Epithelial FCM stimulation increased expression of mesenchymal markers and reduced E-cadherin expression, features of EMT which were TNFα and IL-1β-dependent. Using organotypic culture models, primary EoE epithelial cells exhibited features of EMT compared to non-EoE cells, corresponding to patterns of EMT in native biopsies.
Conclusions
Esophageal epithelial cell and fibroblast cross-talk contributes to esophageal fibrosis. Our results suggest that features of EMT can develop independent of TGF-β and granulocytes, which may have important implications in treatment of EoE.

Abstract: Cell binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for cell and tissue functions. In this context, each tissue consists of a unique ECM composition, which may be responsible for tissue-specific cell responses. Due to the complexity of ECM-cell interactions—which depend on the interplay of inside-out and outside-in signaling cascades, cell and tissue specificity of ECM-guidance is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the role of different ECM components like laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type I with respect to the essential cell behaviour patterns: attachment dynamics such as adhesion kinetic and force, formation of focal adhesion complexes, morphology, proliferation, and intercellular communication. A detailed in vitro comparison of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, and chondrocytes reveals significant differences in their cell responses to the ECM: cell behaviour follows a cell specific ligand priority ranking, which was independent of the cell type origin. Fibroblasts responded best to fibronectin, chondrocytes best to collagen I, the other cell types best to laminin. This knowledge is essential for optimization of tissue-biomaterial interfaces in all tissue engineering applications and gives insight into tissue-specific cell guidance.

Abstract: The leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), also known as GPR49, is a seven-transmembrane receptor that is expressed in stem cells of the intestinal crypts and hair follicles of mice. LGR5 is overexpressed in some types of human cancer, and is one of the target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway. To explore the function of LGR5 in cancer cells, stable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged LGR5 were established. Overexpression of LGR5 resulted in changes in cell shape from an extended flat (mesenchymal) phenotype to a round aggregated (stem cell-like) phenotype. Cells transfected with LGR5 showed higher colony forming activity, and were more resistant to a cytotoxic drug than cells transfected with empty vector. Overexpression of LGR5 inhibited cell motility. LGR5-transfected cells formed nodule type tumors in the livers of immunodeficient mice, whereas empty vector-transfected cells formed more invasive tumors. Down-regulation of LGR5 changed the morphology of HCC cells from the aggregated phenotype to an extended spindle phenotype, and cell motility was increased. This is the first study reporting the functional role of LGR5 in the biology of HCC cells, and the results suggest that aberrant expression of LGR5 regulates epithelial cell phenotype and survival.

Abstract: The bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSCs) have been widely used in cell transplant therapy, and the proliferative ability of bmMSCs is one of the determinants of the therapy efficiency. Lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) as a transmembrane protein is responsible for binding, internalizing and degrading oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). It has been identified that LOX-1 is expressed in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and monocytes. In these cells, low concentration of ox-LDL (<40μg/mL) stimulates their proliferation via LOX-1 activation. However, it is poor understood that whether LOX-1 is expressed in bmMSCs and which role it plays. In this study, we investigated the status of LOX-1 expression in bmMSCs and its function on bmMSC proliferation. Our results showed that primary bmMSCs exhibiting a typical fibroblast-like morphology are positive for CD44 and CD90, but negative for CD34 and CD45. LOX-1 in both mRNA and protein levels is highly expressed in bmMSCs. Meanwhile, bmMSCs exhibit a strong potential to take up ox-LDL. Moreover, LOX-1 expression in bmMSCs is upregulated by ox-LDL with a dose- and time-dependent manner. Presence of ox-LDL also enhances the proliferation of bmMSCs. Knockdown of LOX-1 expression significantly inhibits ox-LDL-induced bmMSC proliferation. These findings indicate that LOX-1 plays a role in bmMSC proliferation.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are among the target cells of cancer therapy because they are uniquely involved in both cancer progression and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. We identified side population (SP) cells, which are known to be an enriched population of CSC, in five oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells (SCC9, SCC25, TOSCC7, TOSCC17, and TOSCC23). The percentages of SP cells ranged from 0% to 3.3%, with TOSCC23 cells showing the highest percentages of SP cells (3.3% of the total cell population). The SP cells isolated from TOSCC23 cells also showed greater cell proliferation and invasion compared to non-SP (MP) cells. Therefore, our initial findings suggested that SP cells were enriched for CSC-like cells. Furthermore, DNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of cell proliferation-related and anti-apoptotic genes was greater in SP cells compared to MP cells. We focused on Lin28a, which showed the highest expression (approximately 22-fold) among the upregulated genes. The overexpression of Lin28a in TOSCC23 cells increased their proliferation, colony formation, and invasion. These findings suggest that Lin28a is an appropriate CSC target molecule for OSCC treatment

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that simvastatin has antitumor properties in several types of cancer cells, mainly by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting growth. The arrest of proliferation is a feature of cellular senescence; however, the occurrence of senescence in melanoma cells upon simvastatin treatment has not been investigated until now. Our results demonstrated that exposure of human metastatic melanoma cells (WM9) to simvastatin induces a senescent phenotype, characterized by G1 arrest, positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay, and morphological changes. Also, the main pathways leading to cell senescence were examined in simvastatin-treated human melanoma cells, and the expression levels of phospho-p53 and p21 were upregulated by simvastatin, suggesting that cell cycle regulators and DNA damage pathways are involved in the onset of senescence. Since simvastatin can act as a pro-oxidant agent, and oxidative stress may be related to senescence, we measured the intracellular ROS levels in WM9 cells upon simvastatin treatment. Interestingly, we found an increased amount of intracellular ROS in these cells, which was accompanied by elevated expression of catalase and peroxiredoxin-1. Collectively, our results demonstrated that simvastatin can induce senescence in human melanoma cells by activation of p53/p21 pathway, and that oxidative stress may be related to this process.

During initiation of the symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host, which can be observed directly and in real time, approximately five V. fischeri cells aggregate along the mucociliary membranes of a superficial epithelium prior to entering host tissues. Here, we show that these few early host-associated symbionts specifically induce robust changes in host gene expression that are critical to subsequent colonization steps. This exquisitely sensitive response to the host’s specific symbiotic partner includes the upregulation of a host endochitinase, whose activity hydrolyzes polymeric chitin in the mucus into chitobiose, thereby priming the symbiont and also producing a chemoattractant gradient that promotes V. fischeri migration into host tissues. Thus, the host responds transcriptionally upon initial symbiont contact, which facilitates subsequent colonization.

Abstract: The repair of skeletal defects remains a substantial economic and biomedical burden. The extra-embryonic fetal stem cells derived from amniotic fluid (AFSCs) have been used for the treatment of large bone defects, but mechanisms of repair are not clear. Here we studied the potential contribution of human AFSCs to the modeling of an ectopic bone. We found that AFSCs are not osteogenic in vivo, and, compared to bone marrow-derived stromal cells, recruit more host CD31 and VEGF-R2 positive cells. Finally, when AFSCs were co-implanted with human-bone forming cells, a normo-osteosynthesis occurred, the engineered ossicle was hyper-vascularized, but AFSCs were not retrieved in the implant within 2weeks. We concluded that AFSCs do not contribute to the deposition of new bone, but act as a powerful proinflammatory/proangiogenic boost, driving a host response, ending in AFSC clearance and vascularization of the bone environment. In our model, a source of osteocommitted cells, capable to engraft and proliferate in vivo, is needed in order to engineer bone. The angio-attractant properties of AFSCs could be exploited in strategies of endogenous cell homing to actively recruit host progenitors into a predefined anatomic location for in situ bone tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I is activated by viral RNA and induces type I IFN responses to control viral replication. The cellular dsRNA binding protein PACT can also activate RIG-I. To counteract innate antiviral responses, some viruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV), encode proteins that antagonize RIG-I signaling. Here, we show that EBOV VP35 inhibits PACT-induced RIG-I ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The interaction of PACT with RIG-I is disrupted by wild-type VP35, but not by VP35 mutants that are unable to bind PACT. In addition, PACT-VP35 interaction impairs the association between VP35 and the viral polymerase, thereby diminishing viral RNA synthesis and modulating EBOV replication. PACT-deficient cells are defective in IFN induction and are insensitive to VP35 function. These data support a model in which the VP35-PACT interaction is mutually antagonistic and plays a fundamental role in determining the outcome of EBOV infection.

Abstract: Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation is dependent on a core transcriptional network and proper cell–cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin (E-cad). Whereas E-cad is associated with pluripotency, N-cadherin (N-cad) expression is correlated with differentiation into mesodermal and neuroectodermal lineages. We investigated whether E-cad harbors unique molecular features in establishing or maintaining pluripotency. By using a gene replacement knock-in (ki) approach to express N-cadherin (N-cad) or E-cad/N-cad chimeric cadherins under the control of the E-cad locus, we show that all E-cad-depleted ki/ki ES cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state. Surprisingly, these cells retained key features of pluripotency, such as Nanog expression and full differentiation capacity in vitro and in vivo, whereas E-cad knockout (ko) ES cells irreversibly lost most of these features. Moreover, our results indicate that E-cad mediated adhesion is essential for iPS cell generation, since E-cad depleted fibroblasts were not reprogrammed. In contrast, N-cad efficiently supports somatic reprogramming similar to E-cad, and permits initiation of the crucial initial step of mesenchymal–epithelial transition. Thus, we show that cell adhesion and a robust pluripotent phenotype are ultimately connected. Since N-cad properly compensates for loss of E-cad, no specific ‘cadherin code’ is required.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine whether the growth and differentiation of limbal epithelial stem cell cultures could be controlled through manipulation of the oxygen tension. Limbal epithelial cells were isolated from corneoscleral disks, and cultured using either feeder cells in a growth medium supplemented with serum (3T3 system) or without feeder cells in a dedicated serum-free medium (EpiLife). During the culture, the cells were maintained either at ambient oxygen tension (20%) or at different levels of hypoxia (15, 10, 5, and 2% oxygen). The effect of oxygen on cell growth, progression through cell cycle, colony forming efficiency (CFE), and expression of stem cell (ABCG2 and p63α) and differentiation (CK3) markers was determined throughout the culture period of up to 18days. Low oxygen levels favored a stem cell phenotype with a lower proliferative rate, high CFE, and a relatively higher expression of ABCG2 and p63α, while higher levels of oxygen led not only to decreased CFE but also to increased proportion of differentiated cells positive for CK3. Hypoxic cultures may thus potentially improve stem cell grafts for cultured limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET).

Abstract: Icariin (ICA) has been reported to facilitate cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells; however, the mechanism by which ICA induced cardiomyogenesis has not been fully elucidated yet. Here, an underlying signaling network including metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), Homer, phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Enhancer (PIKE), phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) was investigated in ICA induced cardiomyogenesis. Our results showed that the co-expression of mGluR5 together with α-actinin or Troponin T in embryoid bodies (EBs) treated with ICA was elevated to 10.86% and 9.62%, compared with the case in the control (4.04% and 3.45%, respectively). Exposure of EBs to ICA for 2h remarkably increased the dimeric form of mGluR5, which was inhibited by small interfering RNA targeting mGluR5 (si-mGluR5). Moreover, the extracellular glutamate concentration in ICA treatment medium was elevated to 28.9±3.5μM. Furthermore, the activation of mGluR5 by ICA triggered the formation of Homer–PIKE complex and activated PI3K, stimulating ROS generation and NF-κB nuclear translocation. Knockdown of mGluR5 or inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 blocked ICA induced cardiomyogenesis via repressing mGluR5 pathway, reducing ROS and NF-κB activation. These results revealed that the inducible mechanisms of ICA were related to activate mGluR5 pathway.

Abstract: GEP100, a guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF) for Arf6, plays a pivotal role in promoting breast cancer cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo. However, the precise mechanism for GEP100-mediated cell invasion is still poorly understood. In this study, we found that down-regulation of endogenous GEP100 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly inhibited EGF-induced cell invasion, which was rescued by over-expression of ectopic GEP100. EGF increased Arf6 activity, ERK phosphorylation, and uPAR expression in a time dependent manner. Additionally, blocking Arf6 with Arf6 siRNA largely abolished EGF-induced cell invasion. GEP100 siRNA or Arf6 siRNA suppressed EGF-induced ERK activity and uPAR expression. Furthermore, blocking ERK signaling with U0126, a specific inhibitor for MEK, markedly inhibited EGF-induced uPAR expression and consequently cell invasion. Inhibition of uPAR expression by uPAR siRNA also significantly abolished EGF-induced cell invasion. Taken together, this study illustrates that GEP100 regulates an Arf6/ERK/uPAR signaling cascade in EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion. These findings could provide a rationale for designing new therapies based on inhibition of breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) is a conserved protein that is found up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By using zebrafish, combined with HCC cell lines, we further investigated the role of CAP2. The zebrafish CAP2 sequence was 60% identical to human CAP2 with 77% homology in the C-terminal actin-binding domain, and 58% in the N-terminal cyclase-binding domain. CAP2 expression was observed during zebrafish development and was preferentially expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart. Knockdown using two different morpholinos against CAP2 resulted in a short-body morphant zebrafish phenotype with pericardial edema. CAP2 was observed co-localized with actin in zebrafish skeletal muscle, and in the leading edge of lamellipodium in HCC cell lines. CAP2 silencing resulted in a defect in lamellipodium formation and decreased cell motility in HCC cell lines. Strongly positive expression of CAP2 was observed in 10 of 16 (63%) poorly, 30 of 68 (44%) moderately, and 2 of 21 (10%) well differentiated HCC. CAP2 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, poor differentiation, portal vein invasion, and intrahepatic metastasis. Our results indicate that an important conserved function of CAP2 in higher vertebrates may be associated with the process of skeletal muscle development. CAP2 also played an important role in enhancing cell motility, which may promote a more invasive behavior in the progression of HCC. These findings highlight the link between development and cancer.

Abstract: Autophagy, or autophagocytosis, is a selective intracellular degradative process involving the cell's own lysosomal apparatus. An essential component in cell development, homeostasis, repair and resistance to stress, autophagy may result in either cell death or survival. The targeted region of the cell is sequestered within a membrane structure, the autophagosome, for regulation of the catabolic process. A key factor in both autophagosome formation and autophagosome maturation is a protein encoded by the ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG). Conversely, the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), which regulates survival in various cancers, inhibits autophagy through mTOR activation. We found that Akt1 may also directly inhibit autophagy by down-regulating UVRAG both in a 293T transient transfection system and breast cancer cells stably expressing Akt1. The UVRAG with mutations at putative Akt1-phosphorylation sites were still inhibited by Akt1, and dominant-negative Akt1 also inhibited UVRAG expression, suggesting that Akt1 down-regulates UVRAG by a kinase activity-independent mechanism. We showed that Akt1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells down-regulated UVRAG transcription. Cells over-expressing Akt1 were more resistant than control cells to ultraviolet light-induced autophagy and exhibited the associated reduction in cell viability. Levels of the autophagosome indicator protein LC3B-II and mRFP-GFP-LC3 were reduced in cells that over-expressing Akt1. Inhibiting Akt1 by siRNA or reintroducing UVRAG gene rescued the level of LC3B-II in UV-irradiation. Altogether, these data suggest that Akt1 may inhibit autophagy by decreasing UVRAG expression, which also sensitizes cancer cells to UV irradiation.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be used to model the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie embryonic development. Understanding the cellular mechanisms and pathways involved in extraembryonic (ExE) differentiation is of great interest because of the important role of this process in maternal health and fertility. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is widely used to maintain the self-renewal of hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells, while all trans retinoic acid (RA) is used to facilitate the directed differentiation of hESCs. Here, we monitored the RA induced differentiation of hESCs to the ExE lineage with and without FGF-2 over a 7-day period via global transcriptional profiling. The stemness markers POU5F1, NANOG and TDGF1 were markedly downregulated, whereas an upregulation of the ExE markers KRT7, CGA, DDAH2 and IGFBP3 was observed. Many of the differentially expressed genes were involved in WNT and TGF-β signaling. RA inactivated WNT signaling even in the presence of exogenous FGF-2, which that promotes the maintenance of the pluripotent state. We also show that BMP4 was upregulated and that RA was able to modulate the TGF-β signaling pathway and direct hESCs toward the ExE lineage. In addition, an epigenetic study revealed hypermethylation of the DDAH2, TDGF1 and GATA3 gene promoters, suggesting a role for epigenetic regulation during ExE differentiation. These data reveals that the effect of RA prevails in the presence of exogenous FGF-2 thus resulting in the direction of hESCs toward the ExE lineage.

Abstract: Over the last few years the therapeutic approach to demyelinating diseases has radically changed, strategies having been developed aimed at partnering the classic symptomatic treatments with the most advanced regenerative medicine tools. At first, the transplantation of myelinogenic cells, Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes was suggested, but the considerable technical difficulties, (poor availability, difficulties in harvesting and culturing, and the problem of rejection in the event of non-autologous sources), shifted attention towards more versatile cellular types, such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). Recent studies have already demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that glially-primed MSCs (through exposure to chemical cocktails) have myelogenic abilities. In spite of a large number of papers on glially-differentiated MSCs, little is known about the ability of undifferentiated MSCs to myelinate axons and processes. Here we have demonstrated that also undifferentiated MSCs have the ability to myelinate, since they induce the myelination of rat DRG neuron processes after direct co-culturing. In this process a pivotal role is performed by the p75 receptor.

Abstract: Mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) are unipotent progenitors of the gametes. Nonetheless, they can give rise directly to pluripotent stem cells in vitro or during teratocarcinogenesis. This conversion is inconsistent, however, and has been difficult to study. Here, we delineate requirements for efficient resetting of pluripotency in culture. We demonstrate that in defined conditions, routinely 20% of PGCs become EG cells. Conversion can occur from the earliest specified PGCs. The entire process can be tracked from single cells. It is driven by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the downstream transcription factor STAT3. In contrast, LIF signaling is not required during germ cell ontogeny. We surmise that ectopic LIF/STAT3 stimulation reconstructs latent pluripotency and self-renewal. Notably, STAT3 targets are significantly upregulated in germ cell tumors, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may underlie teratocarcinogenesis. These findings demonstrate that EG cell formation is a robust experimental system for exploring mechanisms involved in reprogramming and cancer.

Abstract: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase. Accumulating evidences suggest that ILK are involved in cell–matrix interactions, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. EMT has been postulated as a prerequisite for metastasis. The reports have demonstrated that EMT was implicated in metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore, here we further postulate that ILK might participate in EMT of tongue cancer. We showed that ILK siRNA inhibited EMT with low N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug and Twist as well as high E-cadherin expression in vivo and in vitro. We found that knockdown of ILK inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as changed cell morphology. We also demonstrated that ILK siRNA inhibited phosphorylation of downstream signaling targets Akt and GSK3β as well as reduced expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore, we found that the tongue tumor with high metastasis capability showed higher ILK, Vimentin, Snail, Slug and Twist as well as lower E-cadherin expression in clinical specimens. Finally, ILK siRNA led to the suppression for tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Our findings suggest that ILK could be a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for tongue cancer.

Abstract: Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) enhances prostate cancer (CaP) growth and metastasis in vivo. PTHrP also increases cell survival and migration, and upregulates pro-invasive integrin α6β4 expression. We used the human CaP cell lines C4-2 and PC-3 as model systems to study the mechanisms via which PTHrP regulates α6β4 levels. We report that PTHrP regulates α6 and β4 levels via a transcriptional pathway; β4 regulation involves the NF-κB pathway. PTHrP also regulates β4 levels at the post-translational level. PTHrP inhibits caspase-3 and -7 activities. Post-translational regulation of β4 by PTHrP is mediated via attenuation of its proteolytic cleavage by these caspases. Since α6 dimerizes with β4, increased β4 levels result in elevated α6 levels. Suppressing β4 using siRNA attenuates the effect of caspase inhibition on apoptosis and cell migration. These results provide evidence of a link between PTHrP, integrin α6β4 levels as a function of caspase activity, and cell survival and migration. Targeting PTHrP in CaP cancer, thereby reversing the effect on caspase activity and α6β4 levels, may thus prove therapeutically beneficial.

Abstract: Recent reports suggest that the adult epicardium is a source of cardiac progenitor cells having the ability to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and predominantly differentiate into myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to fibrosis of the stressed myocardium. Islet-1 (Isl1) is a widely applied marker of progenitor cells, including the epicardial mesothelial cells (EMCs). However, little is known of the general biological function of Islet-1, let alone its role in EMT of EMCs. Using rat-derived adult EMC cultures we therefore investigated the role of Isl1 expression in both non-stimulated EMCs and during TGF-β-induced EMT. We found that Isl1 had a dual role by promoting mesenchymal features in non-stimulated EMCs, while a loss of Isl1 associated with EMT acted as a negative modulator of EMT progression as assessed on phenotype. We furthermore found that the loss of Isl1 expression during EMT was, in addition to transcriptional regulation by β-catenin, mediated through direct targeting by microRNA-31 (miR-31). Through manipulations of miR-31 bioactivity in EMCs, we thus report that miR-31 is a negative modulator of cardiac fibrogenic EMT, primarily via targeting Isl1. Our data show that Isl1 is a key regulatory molecule in adult cardiac EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is a staphylococcal bicomponent pore-forming toxin linked to severe invasive infections. Target-cell and species specificity of PVL are poorly understood, and the mechanism of action of this toxin in Staphylococcus aureus virulence is controversial. Here, we identify the human complement receptors C5aR and C5L2 as host targets of PVL, mediating both toxin binding and cytotoxicity. Expression and interspecies variations of the C5aR determine cell and species specificity of PVL. The C5aR binding PVL component, LukS-PV, is a potent inhibitor of C5a-induced immune cell activation. These findings provide insight into leukocidin function and staphylococcal virulence and offer directions for future investigations into individual susceptibility to severe staphylococcal disease.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacological modulators of host-microbial interactions can in principle be identified using high-content screens. However, a severe limitation of this approach is the lack of insights into the mode of action of compounds selected during the primary screen. To overcome this problem, we developed a combined experimental and computational approach. We designed a quantitative multiparametric image-based assay to measure intracellular mycobacteria in primary human macrophages, screened a chemical library containing FDA-approved drugs, and validated three compounds for intracellular killing of M. tuberculosis. By integrating the multiparametric profiles of the chemicals with those of siRNAs from a genome-wide survey on endocytosis, we predicted and experimentally verified that two compounds modulate autophagy, whereas the third accelerates endosomal progression. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating small molecules and genetic screens for identifying cellular mechanisms modulated by chemicals. Furthermore, selective pharmacological modulation of host trafficking pathways can be applied to intracellular pathogens beyond mycobacteria.

Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. The molecular basis for the development and progression of HD is currently poorly understood. However, different DNA repair pathways have been implicated in both somatic expansion and disease progression. Embryonic stem cells provide a remarkable in vitro system to study HD and could have implications for understanding disease development and for therapeutic treatment. Here, we derive pluripotent stem cells from the mouse R6/1 HD model and demonstrate that repeated exposure to genotoxic agents inducing oxidative DNA damage gave a significant and dose dependent increase in somatic triplet expansion. Further investigation into specific steps of DNA repair revealed impaired double stranded break repair in exposed R6/1 cells, accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. We also found that differentiation status, and consequently DNA repair efficiency influenced somatic expansion. Our data underscore the importance of DNA damage and repair for the stability of the HD triplet in pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Stem cells have a specialized microenvironment for maintaining self-renewal and multipotent capacities. It is believed that a cornea epithelial stem cell niche exists in the limbus. To characterize the niche of limbal epithelial stem cells, we observed the limbal basal epithelial layer by histological analysis. Cell clusters or cell suspensions from limbal tissue were prepared with collagenase or dispase II and fixed for cytospin sections. Adhesion assays were done to quantitate calcium-dependent cell adhesion. Limbal tissue and cytospin sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. AQP1 positive (AQP1+) cells were observed as non-epithelial cells in the subepithelial stroma. AQP1 expression did not co-localize with CD31, podoplanin, MART-1 positive cells, but were observed in vimentin positive stromal cells. When we made a thorough search of limbal basal cells by confocal microscopy, AQP1+ were observed in the proximity of N-cad, K15 and p63 positive limbal basal epithelial cells. Furthermore, electron microscope revealed stromal cells penetrating the epithelial basal membrane and forming calcium-dependent cellular adhesions with N-cad+ limbal basal epithelial cells. Although we could not clearly detect the expression of N-cad in the AQP1+ cells, AQP1+ cells immediately beneath the epithelial basement membrane may be stromal niche-like cells that directly interact with N-cad+ limbal basal epithelial progenitor cells.

Abstract: The morphology of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the normal physiological state depends on cytoskeletal distribution and topology beneath, and presents vertical to the direction of blood flow shear stress (FFSS) although SMCs physiologically are not directly exposed to the shear conditions of blood flow. However, this condition is relevant for arteriosclerotic plaques and the sites of a vascular stent, and little of this condition in vitro has been studied and reported till now. It is unclear what will happen to SMC morphology, phenotype and function when the direction of the blood flow changed. In this paper, the distribution of SMCs in a specific area on Ti surface was regulated by micro-strips of hyaluronic acid (HA). Cell morphology depended on the distribution of the cytoskeleton extending along the micrographic direction. Simulated vascular FFSS was perpendicular or parallel to the direction of the cytoskeleton distribution. Based on investigating the morphology, apoptotic number, phenotypes and functional factors of SMCs, it was obtained that SMCs of vertical groups showed more apoptosis, expressed more contractile types and secreted less TGF-β1 factor compared with SMCs of parallel groups, the number of ECs cultured by medium from SMCs of parallel groups was larger than vertical groups. This study could help to understand the effect of direction change of FFSS on patterned SMC morphology, phenotype and function.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) mediates a variety of cellular responses with atleast six G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors (LPA receptor−1 (LPA1–LPA6)). The interaction between LPA receptors and other cellular molecules on the biological function is not fully understood. Recently, we have reported that LPA1 suppressed and LPA3 stimulated cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells. In the present study, to evaluate the function of LPA2 on motile and invasive activities of pancreatic cancer cells, we generated Lpar2 knockdown (HPD-sh2) cells from hamster pancreatic cancer cells and measured their cell migration ability. In cell motility and invasive assays with an uncoated Cell Culture Insert, HPD-sh2 cells showed significantly lower intrinsic activity than control (HPD–GFP) cells. Since K-ras mutations were frequently detected in pancreatic cancer, we next investigated whether oncogenic K-ras is involved in cell migration induced by LPA2 using K-ras knockdown (HPD-K2) cells. The cell motile ability of HPD-K2 cells was significantly lower than that of control cells. To confirm LPA2 increases cell migration activity, cells were pretreated with dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) which is the antagonist of LPA1/LPA3. The cell motile and invasive abilities of DGPP -treated HPD–GFP cells were markedly higher than those of untreated cells, but DGPP did not stimulate cell migration of HPD-K2 cells. These results suggest that cell migration activity of pancreatic cancer cells stimulated by LPA2 may be enhanced by oncogenic K-ras.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) homeostasis requires the action of multiple pathways. There is some controversy regarding whether small intestine (SI) Paneth cells (PCs) play a central role in orchestrating crypt architecture and their relationship with Lgr5+ve stem cells. Nevertheless, we previously showed that germline CSF-1 receptor (Csf1r) knock out (KO) or Csf1 mutation is associated with an absence of mature PC, reduced crypt proliferation and lowered stem cell gene, Lgr5 expression. Here we show the additional loss of CD24, Bmi1 and Olfm4 expression in the KO crypts and a high resolution 3D localization of CSF-1R mainly to PC. The induction of GI-specific Csf1r deletion in young adult mice also led to PC loss over a period of weeks, in accord with the anticipated long life span of PC, changed distribution of proliferating cells and this was with a commensurate loss of Lgr5 and other stem cell marker gene expression. By culturing SI organoids, we further show that the Csf1r−/− defect in PC production is intrinsic to epithelial cells as well as definitively affecting stem cell activity. These results show that CSF-1R directly supports PC maturation and that in turn PCs fashion the intestinal stem cell niche.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common brain tumor. Median survival in unselected patients is <10 months. The tumor harbors stem-like cells that self-renew and propagate upon serial transplantation in mice, although the clinical relevance of these cells has not been well documented. We have performed the first genome-wide analysis that directly relates the gene expression profile of nine enriched populations of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) to five identically isolated and cultivated populations of stem cells from the normal adult human brain. Although the two cell types share common stem- and lineage-related markers, GSCs show a more heterogeneous gene expression. We identified a number of pathways that are dysregulated in GSCs. A subset of these pathways has previously been identified in leukemic stem cells, suggesting that cancer stem cells of different origin may have common features. Genes upregulated in GSCs were also highly expressed in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that canonical Wnt-signaling plays an important role in GSCs, but not in adult human neural stem cells. As well we identified a 30-gene signature highly overexpressed in GSCs. The expression of these signature genes correlates with clinical outcome and demonstrates the clinical relevance of GSCs.

Abstract: Marked sequence variation in the mtDNA control region has been observed in human single CD34+ cells, which persist in vivo and are present also in differentiated hematopoietic cells. In this study, we analyzed 5071 single CD34+ cells from 49 individuals (including 31 maternally related members from four families and 18 unrelated donors) in order to determine the mutation spectrum within the mtDNA control region in single cells, as related to aging and family genetic background. Many highly mutated sites among family members were hypervariable sites in the mtDNA control region. Further, CD34+ cells from members of the same family also shared several unique mtDNA variants, suggesting pedigree-specific occurrence of these variants. Overall age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations in CD34+ cells varied in different families, suggesting a specific accumulation pattern, which might be modulated by family genetic background. Our current findings have implications for the occurrence of mtDNA mutations in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Immunosuppression therapy following organ transplantation is a significant factor in the development and progression of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced posttransplant Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Switching from cyclosporine to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is reported to promote KS regression without allograft rejection. Examining the underlying molecular basis for this clinical observation, we find that KSHV infection selectively upregulates mTOR signaling in primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), but not blood endothelial cells (BECs), and sensitizes LECs to rapamycin-induced apoptosis. Viral transcriptome analysis revealed that while infected BECs display conventional latency, KSHV-infected LECs support a radically different program involving widespread deregulation of both latent and lytic genes. ORF45, a lytic gene selectively expressed in infected LECs, is required for mTOR activation and critical for rapamycin sensitivity. These studies reveal the existence of a unique herpesviral gene expression program corresponding to neither canonical latency nor lytic replication, with important pathogenetic and therapeutic consequences.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently metastasizes to the liver, a phenomenon that involves the participation of transforming-growth-factor-β1 (TGFβ1). Blockade of the protumorigenic effects elicited by TGFβ1 in advanced CRC could attenuate liver metastasis. We aimed in the present study to assess the antimetastatic effect of TGFβ1-blocking peptides P17 and P144, and to study mechanisms responsible for this activity in a mouse model. Colon adenocarcinoma cells expressing luciferase were pretreated with TGFβ1 (Mc38-lucTGFβ1 cells), injected into the spleen of mice and monitored for tumor development. TGFβ1 increased primary tumor growth and liver metastasis, whereas systemic treatment of mice with either P17 or P144 significantly reduced tumor burden (p<0.01). In metastatic nodules, mitotic/apoptotic ratio, mesenchymal traits and angiogenesis (evaluated by CD-31, as well as circulating endothelial and progenitor cells) induced by TGFβ1 were consistently reduced following injection of peptides. In vitro experiments revealed a direct effect of TGFβ1 in Mc38 cells, which resulted in activation of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad1/5/8, and increased invasion and transendothelial migration, whereas blockade of TGFβ1-signaling reverted these features. Because TGFβ1-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested to induce a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype, we analyzed the ability of this cytokine to induce tumorsphere formation and the expression of CSC markers. In TGFβ1-treated cells, tumorspheres were enriched in CD44 and SOX2, which were diminished in the presence of P17. Our data provide a preclinical rationale to evaluate P17 and P144 as potential therapeutic options for the treatment of metastatic CRC.

Abstract: Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) has a critical role in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation, but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ascorbic acid entry into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the identity of the transport system that is responsible for the uptake of ascorbic acid into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). First, we examined the expression of the two known isoforms of the sodium-coupled ascorbic acid transporter, namely SVCT1 and SVCT2, in BMSCs (Lin−ve Sca1+ve) and bone at the mRNA level. Only SVCT2 mRNA was detected in BMSCs and bone. Uptake of ascorbic acid in BMSCs was Na+-dependent and saturable. In order to define the role of SVCT2 in BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts, BMSCs were stimulated with osteogenic media for different time intervals, and the activity of SVCT2 was monitored by ascorbic acid uptake. SVCT2 expression was up-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs; the expression was maximal at the earliest phase of differentiation. Subsequently, osteogenesis was inhibited in BMSCs upon knock-down of SVCT2 by lentivirus shRNA. We also found that the expression of the SVCT2 could be negatively or positively modulated by the presence of oxidant (Sin-1) or antioxidant (Ascorbic acid) compounds, respectively, in BMSCs. Furthermore, we found that this transporter is also regulated with age in mouse bone. These data show that SVCT2 plays a vital role in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and that its expression is altered under conditions associated with redox reaction. Our findings could be relevant to bone tissue engineering and bone related diseases such as osteoporosis in which oxidative stress and aging plays important role.

Abstract: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an attractive source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the number of HSCs in UCB is limited, and attempts to amplify them in vitro remain inefficient. Several publications have documented amplification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) on endothelial or mesenchymal cells, but the lack of homogeneity in culture conditions and HSC definition impairs direct comparison of these results. We investigated the ability of different feeder layers, mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) and endothelial cells (ECs), to amplify hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Placental derived HSPCs (defined as Lin−CD45−/dimCD34+CD38−CD90+) were maintained on confluent feeder layers and the number of cells and their marker expression were monitored over 21days. Although both types of feeder layers supported hematopoietic expansion, only endothelial cells triggered amplification of Lin−CD45−/dimCD34+CD38−CD90+ cells, which peaked at 14days. The amplified cells differentiated into all cell lineages, as attested by in vitro colony-forming assays, and were capable of engraftment and multi-lineage differentiation in sub-lethally irradiated mice. Mesenchymal progenitors promoted amplification of CD38+ cells, previously defined as precursors with more limited differentiation potential. A competitive assay demonstrated that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells had a preference for interacting with endothelial cells in vitro. Cytokine and transcriptomic analysis of both feeder cell types identified differences in gene expression that correlated with propensity of ECs and MPs to support hematopoietic cell amplification and differentiation respectively. Finally, we used RNA sequencing of endothelial cells and HSPCs to uncover relevant networks illustrating the complex interaction between endothelial cells and HSPCs leading to stem/progenitor cell expansion.

Abstract: Background
CCN2, (a.k.a. connective tissue growth factor and CTGF) has emerged as a regulator of cell migration. While the importance of CCN2 for the fibrotic process in wound healing has been well studied, the effect of CCN2 on keratinocyte function is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism behind CCN2-driven keratinocyte adhesion and migration. Materials and methods: Adhesion assays were performed by coating wells with 10μg/ml fibronectin (FN) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Keratinocytes were seeded in the presence or absence of 200ng/ml CCN2, 5mmol/l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10mmol/l cations, 500μl arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD), 500μM arginine–glycine–glutamate–serine (RGES), and 10μg/ml anti-integrin blocking antibodies. Migration studies were performed using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Quantitative PCR was used to study the effect of CCN2 on integrin subunit mRNA expression. To block intracellular pathways, keratinocytes were pretreated with 20μM PD98059 (MEK-1 inhibitor) or 20μM PF573228 (FAK inhibitor) for 60min prior the addition of CCN2. Western blot was used to measure CCN2, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2. Results: CCN2 enhanced keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin via integrin α5β1. The addition of anti-integrin α5β1 antibodies reduced CCN2-mediated keratinocyte migration. In addition, CCN2 regulated mRNA and protein expression of integrin subunits α5 and β1. CCN2 activated the FAK-MAPK signaling pathway, and pretreatment with MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 markedly reduced CCN2-induced keratinocyte migration. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that CCN2 enhances keratinocyte adhesion and migration through integrin α5β1 and activation of the FAK-MAPK signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
During retroviral RNA encapsidation, two full-length genomic (g) RNAs are selectively incorporated into assembling virions. Packaging involves a cis-acting packaging element (Ψ) within the 5′ untranslated region of unspliced HIV-1 RNA genome. However, the mechanism(s) that selects and limits gRNAs for packaging remains uncertain. Using a dual complementation system involving bipartite HIV-1 gRNA, we observed that gRNA packaging is additionally dependent on a cis-acting RNA element, the genomic RNA packaging enhancer (GRPE), found within the gag p1-p6 domain and overlapping the Gag-Pol ribosomal frameshift signal. Deleting or disrupting the two conserved GRPE stem loops diminished gRNA packaging and infectivity >50-fold, while deleting gag sequences between Ψ and GRPE had no effect. Downregulating the translation termination factor eRF1 produces defective virus particles containing 20 times more gRNA. Thus, only the HIV-1 RNAs employed for Gag-Pol translation may be specifically selected for encapsidation, possibly explaining the limitation of two gRNAs per virion.

Abstract: Recently, we isolated 4 distinct kinds of single chain antibody against human EGF receptor (EGFR) after screening the Keio phage display scFv library by using two methods of target-guided proximity labeling. In the current study, these monovalent scFv antibodies were converted to bivalent IgGs of humanized forms (hIgGs) by recombinant technology using the specially designed expression vectors followed by protein production in CHO cells. The resulting recombinant hIgGs were examined for their binding specificity using several different transformed human BJ cell lines that express deletion mutants of EGFR, each lacking one of 4 distinct extracellular domains (L1, L2, C1 and C2). Immuno-fluorescent microscopy and immuno-precipitation assay on these cells indicated that 4 distinct kinds of hIgGs bind to one of 3 different domains (L1, C1 and C2). Then, these hIgGs were further examined for biological effects on human A431 cancer cells, which overexpress EGFR. The results indicated that hIgG38 binding to L1 and hIgG45 binding to C2 substantially suppressed the EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, resulting in the growth inhibition of A431 cancer cells. On the contrary, hIgG40 binding to C1 and hIgG42 binding to another site (epitope) of C2 exhibited no such inhibitory effects. Thus, the newly produced four recombinant hIgG antibodies recognize 4 different sites (epitopes) in 3 different extracellular domains of EGFR and exhibit different biological effects on cancer cells. These characteristics are somewhat different from the currently utilized therapeutic anti-EGFR antibodies. Hence, these hIgG antibodies will be invaluable as a research tool for the detailed molecular analysis of the EGFR-mediated signal transduction mechanism and more importantly a possible application as new therapeutic agents to treat certain types of cancers.

Abstract: Quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) are considered the reservoir for adult neurogenesis, generating new neurons throughout life. Until now, their isolation has not been reported, which has hampered studies of their regulatory mechanisms. We sorted by FACS quiescent NSCs and their progeny from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice according to the expression of the NSC marker LeX/CD15, the EGF receptor (EGFR) and the CD24 in combination with the vital DNA marker Hoechst 33342. Characterization of sorted cells showed that the LeXbright/EGFR-negative population was enriched in quiescent cells having an NSC phenotype. In contrast to proliferating NSCs and progenitors, the LeXbright/EGFR-negative cells, i.e. quiescent NSCs, resisted to a moderate dose of gamma-radiation (4Gy), entered the cell cycle two days after irradiation prior to EGFR acquisition and ultimately repopulated the SVZ. We further show that the GABAAR signaling regulates their cell cycle entry by using specific GABAAR agonists/antagonists and that the radiation-induced depletion of neuroblasts, the major GABA source, provoked their proliferation in the irradiated SVZ. Our study demonstrates that quiescent NSCs are specifically enriched in the LeXbright/EGFR-negative population, and identifies the GABAAR signaling as a regulator of the SVZ niche size by modulating the quiescence of NSCs.

To establish a functional role for HHARI in cellular proliferation processes, we performed a reverse genetics screen that identified n=86/522 (16.5%) ubiquitin conjugation components that have a statistically significant effect on cell proliferation, which included HHARI as a strong hit. We then produced and validated a panel of specific antibodies that establish HHARI as both a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein that is expressed in all cell types studied. HHARI was expressed at higher levels in nuclei, and co-localized with nuclear bodies including Cajal bodies (p80 coilin, NOPP140), PML and SC35 bodies. We confirmed reduced cellular proliferation after ARIH1 knockdown with individual siRNA duplexes, in addition to significantly increased levels of apoptosis, an increased proportion of cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle, and significant reductions in total cellular RNA levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma biopsies, there are higher levels of HHARI expression associated with increased levels of proliferation, compared to healthy control tissues. We demonstrate that HHARI is associated with cellular proliferation, which may be mediated through its interaction with UbcH7 and modification of proteins in nuclear bodies.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian intestine is colonized with a diverse community of bacteria that perform many beneficial functions but can threaten host health upon tissue invasion. Epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune responses are essential to limit the invasion of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria and maintain beneficial host-bacterial relationships; however, little is known about the role of various cellular processes, notably autophagy, in controlling bacterial interactions with the intestinal epithelium in vivo. We demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cell autophagy protects against tissue invasion by both opportunistically invasive commensals and the invasive intestinal pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. Autophagy is activated following bacterial invasion of epithelial cells through a process requiring epithelial cell-intrinsic signaling via the innate immune adaptor protein MyD88. Additionally, mice deficient in intestinal epithelial cell autophagy exhibit increased dissemination of invasive bacteria to extraintestinal sites. Thus, autophagy is an important epithelial cell-autonomous mechanism of antibacterial defense that protects against dissemination of intestinal bacteria.

Abstract: We identified syntaxin 5 (Stx5), a protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, as a novel interaction partner of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-receptor (VLDL-R), a member of the LDL-receptor family. In addition, we investigated the effect of Stx5 on VLDL-R maturation, trafficking and processing. Here, we demonstrated mutual association of both proteins using several in vitro approaches. Furthermore, we detected a special maturation phenotype of VLDL-R resulting from Stx5 overexpression. We found that Stx5 prevented advanced Golgi-maturation of VLDL-R, but did not cause accumulation of the immature protein in ER, ER to Golgi compartments, or cis-Golgi ribbon, the main expression sites of Stx5. Rather more, abundantly present Stx5 was capable of translocating ER-/N-glycosylated VLDL-R to the plasma membrane, and thus was insensitive to BFA treatment and low temperature. Furthermore, abundant presence of Stx5 significantly interfered with VLDL-R reaching the trans-Golgi network. Based on our findings, we postulate that Stx5 can directly bind to the C-terminal domain of VLDL-R, thereby influencing the receptor′s glycosylation, trafficking and processing characteristics. Resulting from that, we further suggest that Stx5 might play a role in modulating VLDL-R physiology by participating in an abrasively described or completely novel Golgi-bypass pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Research advancing our understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) biology and complex host-Mtb interactions requires consistent and precise quantitative measurements of Mtb proteins. We describe the generation and validation of a compendium of assays to quantify 97% of the 4,012 annotated Mtb proteins by the targeted mass spectrometric method selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Furthermore, we estimate the absolute abundance for 55% of all Mtb proteins, revealing a dynamic range within the Mtb proteome of over four orders of magnitude, and identify previously unannotated proteins. As an example of the assay library utility, we monitored the entire Mtb dormancy survival regulon (DosR), which is linked to anaerobic survival and Mtb persistence, and show its dynamic protein-level regulation during hypoxia. In conclusion, we present a publicly available research resource that supports the sensitive, precise, and reproducible quantification of virtually any Mtb protein by a robust and widely accessible mass spectrometric method.
