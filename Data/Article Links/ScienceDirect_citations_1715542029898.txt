Abstract: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is believed to play a dual role in prostate cancer. Molecular mechanism by which TGFβ1 suppresses early prostate tumor growth and induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in advanced stages is not known. We determined if P21-activated kinase1 (Pak1), which mediates cytoskeletal remodeling is necessary for the TGFβ1 induced prostate cancer EMT. Effects of TGFβ1 on control prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells and those with IPA 3 and siRNA mediated Pak1 inhibition were tested for prostate tumor xenograft in vivo and EMT in vitro. TGFβ1 inhibited PC3 tumor xenograft growth via activation of P38-MAPK and caspase-3, 9. Long-term stimulation with TGFβ1 induced PC3 and DU145 cell scattering and increased expression of EMT markers such as Snail and N-cadherin through tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6)-mediated activation of Rac1/Pak1 pathway. Selective inhibition of Pak1 using IPA 3 or knockdown using siRNA both significantly inhibited TGFβ1-induced prostate cancer cell EMT and expression of mesenchymal markers. Our study demonstrated that TGFβ1 induces apoptosis and EMT in prostate cancer cells via activation of P38-MAPK and Rac1/Pak1 respectively. Our results reveal the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting TGFβ1-Pak1 pathway for advanced-stage prostate cancer.

Abstract: Continuous wave laser processes used to create solar cells with selective emitter and plated Ni–Cu front contacts are a widely discussed topic. Particularly low adhesion of the front metal contact has been identified as a serious challenge. In this work a detailed surface characterization of laser doped and patterned front sides of solar cells shows that formation of silicon oxynitride hinders nickel silicide formation and reduces contact adhesion of Ni–Cu plated contacts. In order to overcome the observed tradeoff between metal contact adhesion and penetration of the pn-junction, this paper presents a novel process sequence based on the formation of a deep selective emitter using a green continuous waver laser and subsequent patterning of the dielectric using a nanosecond-pulsed laser.

Abstract: Atrial myocytes in a number of species lack transverse tubules. As a consequence the intracellular calcium signals occurring during each heartbeat exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. These calcium patterns arise from saltatory calcium waves that propagate via successive rounds of diffusion and calcium-induced calcium release. The many parameters that impinge on calcium-induced calcium release and calcium signal propagation make it difficult to know a priori whether calcium waves will successfully travel, or be extinguished. In this study, we describe in detail a mathematical model of calcium signalling that allows the effect of such parameters to be independently assessed. A key aspect of the model is to follow the triggering and evolution of calcium signals within a realistic three-dimensional cellular volume of an atrial myocyte, but with low computational costs. This is achieved by solving the linear transport equation for calcium analytically between calcium release events and by expressing the onset of calcium liberation as a threshold process. The model makes non-intuitive predictions about calcium signal propagation. For example, our modelling illustrates that the boundary of a cell produces a wave-guiding effect that enables calcium ions to propagate further and for longer, and can subtly alter the pattern of calcium wave movement. The high spatial resolution of the modelling framework allows the study of any arrangement of calcium release sites. We demonstrate that even small variations in randomly positioned release sites cause highly heterogeneous cellular responses. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: The Fas associated death domain protein (FADD) is the key adaptor molecule of the apoptotic signal triggered by death receptors of the TNF-R1 superfamily. Besides its crucial role in the apoptotic machinery, FADD has proved to be important in many biological processes like tumorigenesis, embryonic development or cell cycle progression. In a process to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying FADD regulation, we identified the anti-apoptotic kinase, CK2, as a new partner and regulator of FADD sub-cellular localization. The blockade of CK2 activity induced FADD re-localization within the cell. Moreover, cytoplasmic FADD was increased when CK2β was knocked down. In vitro kinase and pull down assays confirmed that FADD could be phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme. We found that phosphorylation is weak with CK2α alone and optimal in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of CK2α catalytic and CK2β regulatory subunit, showing that FADD phosphorylation is undertaken by the CK2 holoenzyme in a CK2β-driven fashion. We found that CK2 can phosphorylate FADD on the serine 200 and that this phosphorylation is important for nuclear localization of FADD. Altogether, our results show for the first time that multifaceted kinase, CK2, phosphorylates FADD and is involved in its sub-cellular localization. This work uncovered an important role of CK2 in stable FADD nuclear localization.

Abstract: The use of high linear energy transfer radiations in the form of carbon ions in heavy ion beam lines or alpha particles in new radionuclide treatments has increased substantially over the past decade and will continue to do so due to the favourable dose distributions they can offer versus conventional therapies. Previously it has been shown that exposure to heavy ions induces pan-nuclear phosphorylation of several DNA repair proteins such as H2AX and ATM in vitro. Here we describe similar effects of alpha particles on ex vivo irradiated primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Following alpha particle irradiation pan-nuclear phosphorylation of H2AX and ATM, but not DNA-PK and 53BP1, was observed throughout the nucleus. Inhibition of ATM, but not DNA-PK, resulted in the loss of pan-nuclear phosphorylation of H2AX in alpha particle irradiated lymphocytes. Pan-nuclear gamma-H2AX signal was rapidly lost over 24h at a much greater rate than foci loss. Surprisingly, pan-nuclear gamma-H2AX intensity was not dependent on the number of alpha particle induced double strand breaks, rather the number of alpha particles which had traversed the cell nucleus. This distinct fluence dependent damage signature of particle radiation is important in both the fields of radioprotection and clinical oncology in determining radionuclide biological dosimetry and may be indicative of patient response to new radionuclide cancer therapies.

Abstract: Insulin signaling to the glomerular podocyte is important for normal kidney function and is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study determined the role of the insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) in this system. Conditionally immortalized murine podocytes were generated from wild-type (WT) and insulin receptor substrate 2-deficient mice (Irs2−/−). Insulin signaling, glucose transport, cellular motility and cytoskeleton rearrangement were then analyzed. Within the glomerulus IRS2 is enriched in the podocyte and is preferentially phosphorylated by insulin in comparison to IRS1. Irs2−/− podocytes are significantly insulin resistant in respect to AKT signaling, insulin-stimulated GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility. Mechanistically, we discovered that Irs2 deficiency causes insulin resistance through up-regulation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Importantly, suppressing PTEN in Irs2−/− podocytes rescued insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, this study has identified for the first time IRS2 as a critical molecule for sensitizing the podocyte to insulin actions through its ability to modulate PTEN expression. This finding reveals two potential molecular targets in the podocyte for modulating insulin sensitivity and treating DN.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential channel vanilloid type 6 (TRPV6) is a non-selective cation channel with high permeability for Ca2+ ions. So far, the role of TRPV6 in pancreatic beta cells is unknown. In the present study, we characterized the role of TRPV6 in controlling calcium signaling, cell proliferation as well as insulin expression, and secretion in experimental INS-1E beta cell model. TRPV6 protein production was downregulated using siRNA by approx. 70%, as detected by Western blot. Intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was measured by fluorescence Ca2+ imaging using fura-2. Calcineurin/NFAT signaling was analyzed using a NFAT reporter assay as well as a calcineurin activity assay. TRPV6 downregulation resulted in impaired cellular calcium influx. Its downregulation also reduced cell proliferation and decreased insulin mRNA expression. These changes were companied by the inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling. In contrast, insulin exocytosis was not affected by TRPV6 downregulation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time the expression of TRPV6 in INS-1E cells and rat pancreatic beta cells and describes its role in modulating calcium signaling, beta cell proliferation and insulin mRNA expression. In contrast, TRPV6 fails to influence insulin secretion.

Abstract: Emerging liquid phase crystallization (LPC) techniques recently rendered a possible substantial progress in the fabrication of high quality crystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass. The implementation of an efficient light trapping texture into such LPC silicon devices is still challenging as an excellent bulk material quality and well-passivated interfaces have to be guaranteed. In this paper we present recent advances in light management for LPC silicon thin-film solar cells on imprinted glasses. A double-sided 2µm periodic texture is realized by sandwiching the silicon film during the electron-beam induced crystallization process between an imprinted glass substrate coated with silicon oxide and a silicon oxide capping layer. Amorphous-crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) heterojunction solar cells with single sided contacting scheme are fabricated. Textured prototype devices and simultaneously processed planar solar cells exhibit a comparable electronic material quality featuring open circuit voltages above 550mV and efficiencies up to 8.1%. Optical absorption properties of 10µm thick double-side textured silicon films even predict maximum achievable short circuit current densities in solar cells up to 38mA/cm2 assuming zero parasitic absorption.

Abstract: Neutrophils form the first line of defense of the innate immune system and are rapidly recruited by chemotactic signals to sites of inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms of neutrophil chemotaxis is therefore of great interest for the potential development of new immunoregulatory therapies. It has been shown that members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation channels are involved in both cell migration and chemotaxis. In this study, we demonstrate that TRPC1 channels play an important role in fMLP mediated chemotaxis and migration of murine neutrophils. The knock-out of TRPC1 channels leads to an impaired migration, transmigration and chemotaxis of the neutrophils. In contrast, Ca2+ influx but not store release after activation of the TRPC1−/− neutrophils with fMLP is strongly enhanced. We show that the enhanced Ca2+ influx in the TRPC1−/− neutrophils is associated with a steepened front to rear gradient of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration with higher levels at the cell rear. Taken together, this paper highlights a distinct role of TRPC1 in neutrophil migration and chemotaxis. We propose that TRPC1 controls the activity of further Ca2+ influx channels and thus regulates the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ gradients which are critical for cell migration.

Abstract: Solution processed inverted organic photovoltaics (OPVs) usually use (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS derivatives as hole selective contact. In this study the effect of different PEDOT:PSS formulations, Al4083, PH and PH500 in inverted structured OPVs is investigated. Through detailed device physics analysis PEDOT:PSS PH is proposed as most suitable hole selective contact for inverted OPVs device function. Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS PH hole selective contact is treated with 3 different wetting agents, Zonyl FS-300 fluorosurfactant (Zonyl), 2,5,8,11-tetramethyl-6-dodecyn-5,8-diol ethoxylate (Dynol) and Zonyl:Dynol mixture and the corresponding non-encapsulated inverted OPVs investigated under accelerated humidity lifetime conditions. The inverted OPVs incorporating PEDOT:PSS:Zonyl hole selective contact shown limitations on humidity lifetime performance due to the poorest adhesion properties of Zonyl-treated PEDOT:PSS PH compared with Dynol and Zonyl/Dynol mixture treaded PEDOT:PSS PH.

Abstract: A major obstacle to successful treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is its high resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy due to overexpression of multidrug resistance genes. Activation of the AKT pathway is known to be involved in chemoresistance in HCC; however, the underlying mechanisms modulating the AKT pathway by chemopreventive agents remain unclear. In the present study, we found that indole-3-carbinol (I3C) treatment for tumor cells repressed the AKT pathway by increasing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in HCC xenograft tumor and HCC cell lines. qRT-PCR data showed that the expression of miR-21 and miR-221&222 was significantly reduced by I3C in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Reactivation of the AKT pathway via restoration of miR-21 was reversed by I3C. Ectopic expression of miR-21 mediated-accelerated wound healing was abrogated by I3C. Moreover, reducing the expression of miR-21 by anti-miR decreased the resistance of HCC cells to I3C. These results provide experimental evidences that I3C could function as a miR-21 regulator, leading to repression of the PTEN/AKT pathway and opening a new avenue for eradication of drug-resistant cells, thus potentially helping to improve the therapeutic outcome in patients diagnosed with HCC.

Abstract: Rotenone (ROT) is a widely used inhibitor of complex I (CI), the first complex of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. However, particularly at high concentrations ROT was also described to display off-target effects. Here we studied how ROT affected in vitro primary murine myotube formation. We demonstrate that myotube formation is specifically inhibited by ROT (10–100nM), but not by piericidin A (PA; 100nM), another CI inhibitor. At 100nM, both ROT and PA fully blocked myoblast oxygen consumption. Knock-down of Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) and, to a lesser extent ROCK1, prevented the ROT-induced inhibition of myotube formation. Moreover, the latter was reversed by inhibiting Raf-1 activity. In contrast, ROT-induced inhibition of myotube formation was not prevented by knock-down of RhoA. Taken together, our results support a model in which ROT reduces primary myotube formation independent of its inhibitory effect on CI-driven mitochondrial ATP production, but via a mechanism primarily involving the Raf-1/ROCK2 pathway.

Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the only member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily that functions as a chloride channel. The predicted structure of CFTR protein contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), each followed by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2). The opening of the Cl− channel is directly linked to ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's NBD1 and NBD2 domains. The presence of a heterodimeric interfaces (HI) region in NBD1 and NBD2 generated a head to tail orientation necessary for channel activity. This process was also suggested to promote important conformational changes in the associated transmembrane domains of CFTR, which may impact the CFTR plasma membrane stability. To better understand the role of the individual HI region in this process, we generated recombinant CFTR protein with suppressed HI-NBD1 and HI-NBD2. Our results indicate that HI-NBD2 deletion leads to the loss of the dimerization profile of CFTR that affect its plasma membrane stability. We conclude that, in addition to its role in Cl− transport, HI-NBD2 domain confers membrane stability of CFTR by consolidating its quaternary structure through interactions with HI-NBD1 region.

Abstract: The modeling of Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 thin film solar cells enables us to understand device behavior while a reliable simulation with forecasting purpose needs to cover manifold measurement responses. We built up a simulation model to reproduce thermal admittance spectra, capacitance–voltage profiles, quantum efficiency and current–voltage (I–V) measurements in a broad temperature range from 130K to 330K with one parameter set. The comprehensive optical and electrical simulation model has been created as baseline for an indium sulfide buffered Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 solar cell based on measurement outcome and material characterization. The model ascribes the observed N1 feature ascribing it to a valence band barrier between Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 and Mo(Se,S)2 back contact which is also responsible for the roll-over behavior in I–V measurements. A highly doped p+ layer near the heterointerface is accountable for superposition failure of dark and light I–V curves and kink shape at low temperatures. Two-dimensional simulations further show roll-over dependence on back contact inhomogeneities due to sulfur fluctuations.

Abstract: Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPα) is a cell surface protease expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts in the microenvironment of most solid tumors. As there is increasing evidence for proteases having non-catalytic functions, we determined the FAPα interactome in cancer-associated fibroblasts using the quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knockdown (QUICK) method. Complex formation with adenosin deaminase, erlin-2, stomatin, prohibitin, Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein, and caveolin-1 was further validated by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of the known stoichiometric FAPα binding partner dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPPIV) corroborated the proteomic strategy. Reverse co-IPs validated the FAPα interaction with caveolin-1, erlin-2, and stomatin while co-IP upon RNA-interference mediated knock-down of DPPIV excluded adenosin deaminase as a direct FAPα interaction partner. Many newly identified FAPα interaction partners localize to lipid rafts, including caveolin-1, a widely-used marker for lipid raft localization. We hypothesized that this indicates a recruitment of FAPα to lipid raft structures. In density gradient centrifugation, FAPα co-fractionates with caveolin-1. Immunofluorescence optical sectioning microscopy of FAPα and lipid raft markers further corroborates recruitment of FAPα to lipid rafts and invadopodia. FAPα is therefore an integral component of stromal lipid rafts in solid tumors. In essence, we provide one of the first interactome analyses of a cell surface protease and translate these results into novel biological aspects of a marker protein for cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Abstract: Cell motility is a highly dynamic phenomenon that is essential to physiological processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing and immune response, but also involved in pathological conditions such as metastatic dissemination of cancers. The involvement of the molecular chaperone TRAP1 in the regulation of cell motility, although still controversial, has been recently investigated along with some well-characterized roles in cancer cell survival and drug resistance in several tumour types. Among different functions, TRAP1-dependent regulation of protein synthesis seems to be involved in the migratory behaviour of cancer cells and, interestingly, the expression of p70S6K, a kinase responsible for translation initiation, playing a role in cell motility, is regulated by TRAP1. In this study, we demonstrate that TRAP1 silencing enhances cell motility in vitro but compromises the ability of cells to overcome stress conditions, and that this effect is mediated by the AKT/p70S6K pathway. In fact: i) inhibition of p70S6K activity specifically reduces migration in TRAP1 knock-down cells; ii) nutrient deprivation affects p70S6K activity thereby impairing cell migration only in TRAP1-deficient cells; iii) TRAP1 regulates the expression of both AKT and p70S6K at post-transcriptional level; and iii) TRAP1 silencing modulates the expression of genes involved in cell motility and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Notably, a correlation between TRAP1 and AKT expression is found in vivo in human colorectal tumours. These results provide new insights into TRAP1 role in the regulation of cell migration in cancer cells, tumour progression and metastatic mechanisms.

Abstract: Alternative splicing contributes greatly to the proteomic diversity of metazoans. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) methylates arginines of Golgi components and other factors exerting diverse effects on cell growth/differentiation, but the underlying molecular basis for its subcellular distribution and diverse roles has not been fully understood. Here we show the detailed properties of an evolutionarily emerged splice variant of human PRMT5 (PRMT5S) that is distinct from the original isoform (PRMT5L). The isoforms are differentially expressed among mammalian cells and tissues. The PRMT5S is distributed all over the cell but PRMT5L mainly colocalizes with Giantin, a Golgi marker. PRMT5 knockdown led to an enlarged Giantin pattern, which was prevented by the expression of either isoform. Rescuing PRMT5S also increased the percentage of cells with an interphase Giantin pattern compacted at one end of the nucleus, consistent with its cell cycle-arresting effect, while rescuing PRMT5L increased that of the mitotic Giantin patterns of dynamically fragmented structures. Moreover, the isoforms are differentially expressed during neuronal or dendritic cell differentiation, and their ectopic expression showed an opposite effect on dendritic cell differentiation. Furthermore, besides their differential regulation of gene expression, both isoforms also similarly regulate over a thousand genes particularly those involved in apoptosis and differentiation. Taking these properties together, we propose that their differential expression and subcellular localization contribute to spatial and temporal regulation of arginine methylation and gene expression to exert different effects. The novel PRMT5S likely contributes to the observed diverse effects of PRMT5 in cells.

Abstract: Vaccinia-related kinase 3 (VRK3) is known as a pseudokinase that is catalytically inactive due to changes in motifs that are essential for kinase activity. Although VRK3 has been regarded as a genuine pseudokinase from structural and biochemical studies, recent reports suggest that VRK3 acts as an active kinase as well as a signaling scaffold in cells. Here, we demonstrate that VRK3 phosphorylates the nuclear envelope protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) on Ser4. Interestingly, VRK3 kinase activity is dependent upon its N-terminal regulatory region, which is excluded from the determination of its crystal structure. Furthermore, the kinase activity of VRK3 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. VRK3 expression levels increase during interphase, whereas VRK1 is enriched in late G2 and early M phase. Ectopic expression of VRK3 induces the translocation of BAF from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In addition, depletion of VRK3 decreases the population of proliferating cells. These data suggest that VRK3-mediated phosphorylation of BAF may facilitate DNA replication or gene expression by facilitating the dissociation of nuclear envelope proteins and chromatin during interphase.

Abstract: PodocyteTRPC6 channels have been implicated in glomerular diseases. Syndecan-4 (Sdc4) is a membrane proteoglycan that can be cleaved to release a soluble ectodomain capable of paracrine and autocrine signaling. We have confirmed that overexpression of Sdc4 core protein increases surface abundance of TRPC6 channels in cultured podocytes, whereas Sdc4 knockdown has the opposite effect. Exposure to soluble Sdc4 ectodomain also increased the surface abundance of TRPC6, and increased cationic currents evoked by a diacylglycerol analog in podocytes. Sdc4 ectodomain increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced activation of RhoA, increased activation of Rac1, increased nuclear abundance of NFATc1, and increased total β3-integrin. The effects of Sdc4 ectodomain on cell-surface TRPC6 were blocked by the ROS quencher TEMPOL, and by the Rac1 inhibitor NSC-23766, but were not blocked by inhibition of calcineurin–NFATc1 signaling. The Sdc4 core protein co-immunoprecipitates with β3-integrin in cultured podocytes. Moreover, effects of Sdc4 ectodomain on TRPC6, ROS generation, Rac1 and RhoA modulation, and NFATc1 activation were blocked by cilengitide, a selective inhibitor of outside-in signaling through αv-containing integrins. Exposure to TNF, or serum from three patients with recurrent FSGS in relapse, increased shedding of podocyte Sdc4 ectodomains into the surrounding medium. This was also observed after treating podocytes with the metalloproteinase ADAM17 or after overexpression of the Sdc4 core protein. Increased concentrations of Sdc4 ectodomain were detected in urine of rats during acute puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. Locally generated Sdc4 may play a role in regulating TRPC6 channels, and may contribute to glomerular pathology.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis development is associated with morphological changes to intimal cells, leading to a stellate cell phenotype. In this study, we aimed to determine whether and how key pro-atherogenic cytokines present in atherosclerotic plaques (IL-1β, TNFα and IFNγ) could induce this phenotype, as these molecules are known to trigger the transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that, IL-1β was the only major inflammatory mediator tested capable of inducing a stellate morphology in VSMCs. This finding was confirmed by staining for F-actin and vinculin at focal adhesions, as these two markers were disrupted only by IL-1β. We then investigated the possible association of this IL-1β-dependent change in morphology with an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration ([cAMP]), using the FRET-based biosensor for cAMP TEpacVV. Experiments in the presence of IL-1β or medium conditioned by IL-1β-treated VSMCs and pharmacological tools demonstrated that the long-term increase in intracellular cAMP concentration was induced by the secretion of an autocrine/paracrine mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), acting through the EP4 receptor. Finally, by knocking down the expression of the regulatory subunit PKAR1α, thereby reproducing the effects of IL-1β and PGE2 on VSMCs, we demonstrated the contribution of PKA activity to the observed behavior of VSMCs.

A conserved domain important for association of eukaryotic J-protein co-chaperones Jjj1 and Zuo1 with the ribosome,

Abstract: J-proteins, obligate co-chaperones, provide specialization for Hsp70 function in a variety of cellular processes. Two of the 13 J-proteins of the yeast cytosol/nucleus, Zuo1 and Jjj1, are associated with 60S ribosomal subunits. Abundant Zuo1 facilitates folding of nascent polypeptides; Jjj1, of much lower abundance, functions in ribosome biogenesis. However, overexpression of Jjj1 substantially rescues growth defects of cells lacking Zuo1. We analyzed a region held in common by Zuo1 and Jjj1, outside the signature J-domain found in all J-proteins. This shared “zuotin homology domain” (ZHD) is important for ribosome association of both proteins. An N-terminal segment of Jjj1, containing the J-domain and ZHD, is ribosome-associated and, like full-length Jjj1, is competent to rescue both the cold- and cation-sensitivity of ∆zuo1. However, this fragment, when expressed at normal levels, cannot rescue the cytosolic ribosome biogenesis defect of ∆jjj1. Our results are consistent with a model in which the primary functions of Zuo1 and Jjj1 occur in the cytosol. In addition, our data suggest that Zuo1 and Jjj1 bind overlapping sites on ribosomes due to an interaction via their common ZHDs, but Jjj1 binds primarily to pre-60S particles and Zuo1 to mature subunits. We hypothesize that ZUO1 and JJJ1, which are conserved throughout eukaryotes, arose from an ancient duplication of a progenitor J-protein gene that encoded the ZHD ribosome-binding region; subsequently, specialized roles and additional ribosome interaction sites evolved.

Abstract: Mitochondria have retained indispensable but limited genetic information and they import both proteins and nucleic acids from the cytosol. RNA import is essential for gene expression and regulation, whereas competence for DNA uptake is likely to contribute to organellar genome dynamics and evolution. Contrary to protein import mechanisms, the way nucleic acids cross the mitochondrial membranes remains poorly understood. Using proteomic, genetic and biochemical approaches with both plant and yeast organelles, we develop here a model for DNA uptake into mitochondria. The first step includes the voltage-dependent anion channel and an outer membrane-located precursor fraction of a protein normally located in the inner membrane. To proceed, the DNA is then potentially recruited in the intermembrane space by an accessible subunit of one of the respiratory chain complexes. Final translocation through the inner membrane remains the most versatile but points to the components considered to make the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Depending on the size, DNA and RNA cooperate or compete for mitochondrial uptake, which shows that they share import mechanisms. On the other hand, our results imply the existence of more than one route for nucleic acid translocation into mitochondria.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly of industrialized nations, and there is increasing evidence to support a role for chronic inflammation in its pathogenesis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been recently reported to be pro-inflammatory in various diseases such as Alzheimer's and heart failure. Here, we report that intracellular mtDNA induces ARPE-19 cells to secrete inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, which have been consistently associated with AMD onset and progression. The induction was dependent on the size of mtDNA, but not on specific sequence. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the development of AMD, and our findings indicate that mtDNA induces IL-6 and IL-8 more potently when oxidized. Cytokine induction was mediated by STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) and NF-κB as evidenced by abrogation of the cytokine response with the use of specific inhibitors (siRNA and BAY 11-7082, respectively). Finally, mtDNA primed the NLRP3 inflammasome. This study contributes to our understanding of the potential pro-inflammatory role of mtDNA in the pathogenesis of AMD.

Abstract: Scaffold proteins are multidomain proteins without enzymatic function that play a central role in coordinating signaling processes. The scaffold protein CNK1 interacts with pathway-specific signaling proteins and thereby regulates these respective pathways. Here, we revealed tyrosine phosphorylation as a critical regulation mechanism to control the function of CNK1. We identified Tyr 26 as a PDGF-induced and, additionally, Tyr 519 and Tyr 665 as SRC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Phosphomimetic mutants indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr 519 recruits CNK1 to the nucleus and additional phosphorylation of Tyr 26 enables CNK1 to promote SRE-dependent gene expression. Contrary, mutants preventing tyrosine phosphorylation promote matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 promoter activity. CNK1-driven cell proliferation partially depends on its tyrosine phosphorylation. Upon PDGF stimulation, CNK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane mediated by SRC. Knock down of CNK1 prevents PDGF-induced SRE-dependent gene expression, MMP14 promoter activity and cell proliferation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is an important mechanism to control the subcellular localization of CNK1 and its distinct biological functions.

Abstract: Adaptability to stress is a fundamental prerequisite for survival. Mitochondria are a key component of the stress response in all cells. For steroid-hormones-producing cells, including also Leydig cells of testes, the mitochondria are a key control point for the steroid biosynthesis and regulation. However, the mitochondrial biogenesis in steroidogenic cells has never been explored. Here we show that increased mitochondrial biogenesis is the adaptive response of testosterone-producing Leydig cells from stressed rats. All markers of mitochondrial biogenesis together with transcription factors and related kinases are up-regulated in Leydig cells from rats exposed to repeated psychophysical stress. This is followed with increased mitochondrial mass. The expression of PGC1, master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and integrator of environmental signals, is stimulated by cAMP-PRKA, cGMP, and β-adrenergic receptors. Accordingly, stress-triggered mitochondrial biogenesis represents an adaptive mechanism and does not only correlate with but also is an essential for testosterone production, being both events depend on the same regulators. Here we propose that all events induced by acute stress, the most common stress in human society, provoke adaptive response of testosterone-producing Leydig cells and activate PGC1, a protein required to make new mitochondria but also protector against the oxidative damage. Given the importance of mitochondria for steroid hormones production and stress response, as well as the role of steroid hormones in stress response and metabolic syndrome, we anticipate our result to be a starting point for more investigations since stress is a constant factor in life and has become one of the most significant health problems in modern societies.

Abstract: An all solid-state electrochromic system made of a viologen dissolved in a gelatin-based ionogel called Ion Jelly is presented. The obtained Ion Jelly possesses higher ionic conductivity than the constituent ionic liquid, which is ascribed to the broken ionic aggregates caused by the presence of water. Spectro-electrochemical studies carried out with the solid-state cell show that the kinetics of the reduction process is slower than that of the oxidation process, as denoted by the calculated time constants obtained from current vs. time plots. This may be owing to formation of an insoluble reduced species, which remains at the surface of the current collector, facilitating its oxidation process. The kinetics studies also show that the color change in response to the charge transfer process is faster during the reduction step. Both reversibility and durability of the device, upon successive oxidation/reduction steps, are related with the employed reduction potential, being the best compromise with the color contrast achieved at −0.25V vs. Ag/Ag+, where 30% of transmittance change is observed up to 75 switching cycles.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three different procedures for making modulated surface textures (MST) on glass substrates and show the application of these substrates to microcrystalline silicon solar cells. MST substrates have broader surface angle distribution (AD) than a single textured glass substrate and this distribution peaks at higher angles. Therefore, (i) the haze in reflection of MST substrates covered with an Ag layer is over 99% in the wavelength range above 350nm, which is higher than in the case of a single textured glass substrate; (ii) more reflected light is scattered into higher angles, resulting in a broader reflective angular intensity distribution (AID) in air. These properties lead to a higher Jsc for n-i-p microcrystalline silicon solar cells deposited on the MST substrates compared to cells deposited on single textured glass substrate. A solar cell deposited on a MST glass substrate with smoother peaks shows the highest electrical performance (Voc×FF value), because of a lower density of defective regions. The best cell achieved in this work has an active-area efficiency of 10.49%, with a Voc of 0.532V, a Jsc of 26.36mA/cm2, and a FF of 74.8% for a 3-μm thick absorber layer.

Abstract: Importin α8 has recently been identified as an importin α family member based on its primary structure and binding ability to importin β1 and to several karyophilic proteins. However, there has been no experimental evidence that importin α8 actually functions in the nuclear transport of classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS)-containing cargo. Here, using an in vitro transport assay, we demonstrate that purified recombinant importin α8 can transport SV40T antigen cNLS-containing cargo into the nucleus of HeLa cells, in conjunction with importin β1. Pull-down assays, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, identified 179 putative importin α8-binding proteins, only 62 of which overlap with those of importin α1, the closest importin α family member. Among the importin α8-binding candidates, we showed that DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) was actually transported into the nucleus via the importin α8/β1 pathway. Furthermore, we found that the other subtypes of importin α, which were also identified as importin α8-binding candidates, indeed form heterodimers with importin α8. Notably, we found that these importin α8-containing heterodimers were more stable in the presence of cNLS-substrates than heterodimers containing importin α1. From these findings, we propose that importin α8 functions as a cNLS receptor with distinct cargo specificity, and that heterodimerization by importin α8 is a novel regulatory mode of cNLS binding, in addition to the autoinhibitory regulation by the importin β binding domain.

Abstract: Statins are drugs that lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. They are generally well-tolerated, but myopathy is a potentially severe adverse reaction of these compounds. The mechanisms by which statins induce myotoxicity are not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway. The current studies were performed to explore the down-stream effects of the statin-associated inhibition of AKT within the AKT signaling pathway and on myocyte biology and morphology in C2C12 myotubes and in mice in vivo. We exposed C2C12 myotubes to 10μM or 50μM simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for 24h. Simvastatin and atorvastatin inhibited AKT phosphorylation and were cytotoxic starting at 10μM, whereas similar effects were observed for rosuvastatin at 50μM. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was associated with impaired phosphorylation of S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-binding protein 1 and FoxO3a, resulting in reduced protein synthesis, accelerated myofibrillar degradation and atrophy of C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, impaired AKT phosphorylation was associated with activation of caspases and PARP, reflecting induction of apoptosis. Similar findings were detected in skeletal muscle of mice treated orally with 5mg/kg/day simvastatin for 3weeks. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in statin-induced myotoxicity and reveals potential drug targets for treatment of patients with statin-associated myopathies.

Abstract: Reducing the wafer breakage rate without changing the wafer thickness and sawing thinner wafers while maintaining constant breakage rate are two possibilities to decrease the costs of solar cells. They are similar in the sense that both require stronger wafers. To achieve this goal, it is important to gain insight into the wire-sawing process, its underlying defect creation mechanisms and the impact of sawing parameters on wafer strength. Consequently, a series of bricks were sawn with different slurry densities, wire tensions and feed rates, and the results were analyzed in terms of the wafer strength measured by bending tests. Roughness and wafer thickness were also measured. It is found that the strongest wafers were obtained by using a low abrasive volume fraction in the slurry, a low wire tension and a slow feed rate. From the analyses, we provide a qualitative interpretation of the effects of the processes at work in slurry-based wafering that explains, for instance, the wafer thickness and roughness variations. Based on physical arguments about the interaction between the wire, the silicon carbide particles and the silicon wafer, a semi-empirical model relating defect creation to the sawing parameters is developed. With this model, the wafer strength distribution can be predicted, thus simplifying optimization of the sawing process.

Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated both synergistic and opposing effects of Akt and Mek1/2 in various cell functions and disease states. Furthermore, Akt has been reported to inhibit and activate cRaf/Mek pathway, suggesting that their mutual interaction and cooperation may be cell type, stimuli and/or context specific. While PI3-kinase/Akt and cRaf/Mek pathways have been implicated in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, mutual interactions between these two pathways and their specific contributions to the events leading to ECM synthesis and assembly is not clear. We investigated the specific role of Akt1 and Mek1 in ECM synthesis and assembly by NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and how these effects were reconciled to mediate overall ECM remodeling. Our study identified that cooperation between Akt1 and Mek1 is necessary to mediate ECM synthesis. Whereas Akt1 activation resulted in Mek1 activation as evidenced by increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Mek1 inhibition using U0126 or DN-Mek1 resulted in enhanced Akt1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, both Akt1 and Mek1 activities were needed for the synthesis and assembly of ECM. The effect of Akt1 and Mek1 on ECM synthesis was reconciled through the activation of p70 S6-kinase via phosphorylation at T421/S424 and S411, respectively. Furthermore, Akt1 and Mek1 cooperated in mediating ECM assembly via activation of integrin β1. Together, we show for the first time that Akt1 and Mek1 pathways cooperate in the regulation of ECM remodeling by the fibroblasts.

Abstract: Optical modelling and simulations present an indispensable tool in the design, analysis and optimisation of thin-film solar cells of different technologies. In this paper highlights and challenges of different numerical modelling approaches are reviewed, from one-dimensional to rigorous two- or three-dimensional optical modelling. A concept of Coupled Modelling Approach (CMA) is proposed to be used, in which different optical models are coupled together to achieve best performance in speed and accuracy of simulations. A Combined Ray-Optics Wave-optics Model (CROWM) is presented as a simple example of the CMA. In the second part two examples of modelling and simulations are presented. To demonstrate the applicability of 3-D rigorous optical modelling, results of optimisation of periodic substrate surface texture in a micromorph silicon solar cell are shown. Furthermore, a model of non-conformal layer growth is employed to determine morphologies of internal interfaces and to make a selection of suitable textures for defect-less thin-film silicon layer growth. The CROWM simulator was employed to demonstrate the usability of coupled modelling on the example of optimisation of macro-textures in organic solar cells.

Abstract: Gangliosides located at the outer leaflet of plasma membrane are molecules that either participate in recognizing of exogenous ligand molecules or exhibit their own receptor activity, which are both essential phenomena for cell communication and signaling as well as for virus and toxin entry. Regulatory mechanisms of lipid-mediated recognition are primarily subjected to the physical status of the membrane in close vicinity of the receptor. Concerning the multivalent receptor activity of the ganglioside GM1, several regulatory strategies dealing with GM1 clustering and cholesterol involvement have been proposed. So far however, merely the isolated issues were addressed and no interplay between them investigated. In this work, several advanced fluorescence techniques such as Z-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, Förster resonance energy transfer combined with Monte Carlo simulations, and a newly developed fluorescence antibunching assay were employed to give a more complex portrait of clustering and cholesterol involvement in multivalent ligand recognition of GM1. Our results indicate that membrane properties have an impact on a fraction of GM1 molecules that is not available for the ligand binding. While at low GM1 densities (~1 %) it is the cholesterol that turns GM1 headgroups invisible, at higher GM1 level (~4 %) it is purely the local density of GM1 molecules that inhibits the recognition. At medium GM1 content, cooperation of the two phenomena occurs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nanoscale membrane organisation and signalling.

Abstract: Iron sulfur ([Fe–S]) clusters are essential prosthetic groups involved in fundamental cell processes such as gene expression regulation, electron transfer and Lewis acid base chemistry. Central components of their biogenesis are pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent l-cysteine desulfurases, which provide the necessary S atoms for [Fe–S] cluster assembly. The archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Af) has two ORFs, which although annotated as l-cysteine desulfurases of the ISC type (IscS), lack the essential Lys residue (K199 in Af) that forms a Schiff base with PLP. We have previously determined the structure of an Af(IscU–D35A–IscS)2 complex heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and found it to contain a [Fe2S2] cluster. In order to understand the origin of sulfide in that structure we have performed a series of functional tests using wild type and mutated forms of AfIscS. In addition, we have determined the crystal structure of an AfIscS–D199K mutant. From these studies we conclude that: i) AfIscS has no desulfurase activity; ii) in our in vitro [Fe2S2] cluster assembly experiments, sulfide ions are non-enzymatically generated by a mixture of iron, l-cysteine and PLP and iii) the physiological role of AfIscS may be to provide a cysteine ligand to the nascent cluster as observed in the [Fe2S2]–Af(IscU–D35A–IscS)2 complex. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Fe/S proteins: Analysis, structure, function, biogenesis and diseases.

Abstract: PKC activation by combining TPA with sodium butyrate (T/B) represents the most effective and widely used strategy to induce the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle. The results obtained in this study show that novel PKCθ is involved in such process and that it acts through the activation of p38 MAPK and autophagy induction. Autophagy, a mechanism of cellular defense in stressful conditions, is manipulated by EBV to enhance viral replication. Besides promoting the EBV lytic cycle, the activation of p38 and autophagy resulted in a pro-survival effect, as indicated by p38 or ATG5 knocking down experiments. However, this pro-survival role was counteracted by a pro-death activity of PKCθ, due to the dephosphorylation of AKT. In conclusion, this study reports, for the first time, that T/B activates a PKCθ-p38 MAPK axis in EBV infected B cells, that promotes the viral lytic cycle and cell survival and dephosphorylates AKT, balancing cell life and cell death.

Abstract: Mechanotransduction refers to the processes through which cells sense mechanical stimuli by converting them to biochemical signals and, thus, eliciting specific cellular responses. Cells sense mechanical stimuli from their 3D environment, including the extracellular matrix, neighboring cells and other mechanical forces. Incidentally, the emerging concept of mechanical homeostasis,long term or chronic regulation of mechanical properties, seems to apply to neutrophils in a peculiar manner, owing to neutrophils' ability to dynamically switch between the activated/primed and deactivated/deprimed states. While neutrophil activation has been known for over a century, its deactivation is a relatively recent discovery. Even more intriguing is the reversibility of neutrophil activation and deactivation. We review and critically evaluate recent findings that suggest physiological roles for neutrophil activation and deactivation and discuss possible mechanisms by which mechanical stimuli can drive the oscillation of neutrophils between the activated and resting states. We highlight several molecules that have been identified in neutrophil mechanotransduction, including cell adhesion and transmembrane receptors, cytoskeletal and ion channel molecules. The physiological and pathophysiological implications of such mechanically induced signal transduction in neutrophils are highlighted as a basis for future work. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mechanobiology.

Abstract: Hypoxia can cause severe tubulointerstitial injury and peritubular capillary loss. However, hypoxia-induced injury in glomerular capillaries is far milder than tubulointerstitium, but the reason for this difference is unclear. We hypothesized that the phenomenon is due to the protective crosstalk among intrinsic glomerular cells. To mimic the microenvironment and investigate the crosstalk process temporally, we established co-culture models of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) with podocytes or with mesangial cells. We found that podocytes rather than mesangial cells prevented GEnCs from injury and hypoxia-induced apoptosis and promoted migration and angiogenesis of GEnCs under hypoxic conditions. We then identified that increased activation of the hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) pathway as the major mechanism enabling podocytes to protect GEnCs against hypoxia. HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia is known to be dependent on SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1)-mediated deSUMOylate modifications. Therefore, we further targeted deSUMOylation, regulated by SENP1, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of SENP1 mRNA in vitro and measured expression of HIF-1α and its downstream gene VEGF in hypoxic podocytes. Our results showed that SENP1 was essential for HIF-1α deSUMOylation in podocytes. The blockade of deSUMOylation by SENP1 shRNA successfully abolished the activation of HIF-1α signaling and consequently suppressed the protective effects of podocytes on GEnCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that hypoxia may promote HIF-1α stabilization and activation by increasing SENP1 expression in podocytes, which induce GEnCs survival and angiogenesis to resist hypoxia. Thus, deSUMOylation of HIF-1α signaling is a potentially novel therapeutic target for treating hypoxic renal disorders.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with a mesenchymal phenotype show an asymmetric subcellular distribution of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is required for cell migration and invasion. In this work we examine the mechanisms that regulate the intracellular trafficking of CXCR4 in HCC cells. Results indicate that HCC cells present CXCR4 at the cell surface, but most of this protein is in endomembranes colocalizing with markers of the Golgi apparatus and recycling endosomes. The presence of high protein levels of CXCR4 present at the cell surface correlates with a mesenchymal-like phenotype and a high autocrine activation of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway. CXCR4 traffics along the Golgi/exocyst/plasma membrane pathway and requires EXOC4 (Sec8) component of the exocyst complex. HCC cells use distinct mechanisms for the CXCR4 internalization such as dynamin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Regardless of the endocytic mechanisms, colocalization of CXCR4 and Rab11 is observed, which could be involved not only in receptor recycling but also in its post-Golgi transport. In summary, this work highlights membrane trafficking pathways whose pharmacological targeting could subsequently result in the inactivation of one of the main guiding mechanisms used by metastatic cells to colonize secondary organs and tissues.

Abstract: Prostaglandins are a group of lipid signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes. In addition, prostaglandins have been implicated in the development and progression of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. Prostaglandins exert their effects through the activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this report, we examined the role of prostaglandin F2α receptor (FP) signaling as a regulator of chondrocyte differentiation. We found that FP expression was dramatically induced during the differentiation of chondrocytes and was up-regulated in cartilages. Forced expression of FP in ATDC5 chondrogenic cell line resulted in the increased expression of differentiation-related genes and increased synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM) regardless of the presence of insulin. Similarly, PGF2α treatment induced the expression of chondrogenic marker genes. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous FP expression suppressed the expression of chondrocyte marker genes and ECM synthesis. Organ culture of cartilage rudiments revealed that PGF2α induces chondrocyte hypertrophy. Additionally, FP overexpression increased the levels of Bmp-6, phospho-Smad1/5, and Bmpr1a, while knockdown of FP reduced expression of those genes. These results demonstrate that up-regulation of FP expression plays an important role in chondrocyte differentiation and modulates Bmp signaling.

Abstract: Numerous therapeutic proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli and targeted to the periplasm in order to facilitate purification and enable disulfide bond formation. Export is normally achieved by the Sec pathway, which transports proteins through the plasma membrane in a reduced, unfolded state. The Tat pathway is a promising alternative means of export, because it preferentially exports correctly folded proteins; however, the reducing cytoplasm of standard strains has been predicted to preclude export by Tat of proteins that contain disulfide bonds in the native state because, in the reduced state, they are sensed as misfolded and rejected. Here, we have tested a series of disulfide-bond containing biopharmaceuticals for export by the Tat pathway in CyDisCo strains that do enable disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. We show that interferon α2b, human growth hormone (hGH) and two antibody fragments are exported with high efficiency; surprisingly, however, they are efficiently exported even in the absence of cytoplasmic disulfide formation. The exported proteins acquire disulfide bonds in the periplasm, indicating that the normal disulfide oxidation machinery is able to act on the proteins. Tat-dependent export of hGH proceeds even when the disulfide bonds are removed by substitution of the Cys residues involved, suggesting that these substrates adopt tertiary structures that are accepted as fully-folded by the Tat machinery.

Abstract: Expression and activity of the Ste20-like kinase, SLK, are increased during kidney development and recovery from ischemia–reperfusion injury. SLK mediates apoptosis in various cells, and can regulate cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal remodeling. In cells, SLK is detected in a high molecular mass complex, suggesting that SLK is a dimer/oligomer, or is in tight association with other proteins. To better understand the regulation, localization and function of SLK, we sought to identify proteins in this high molecular mass complex. Analysis by mass spectroscopy identified the nucleoporin, translocated promoter region (Tpr), and the cytoskeletal protein, α-actinin-4, as potential SLK-interacting proteins. Using a protein complementation assay, we showed that the 350 amino acid C-terminal, coiled-coil domain of SLK was responsible for homodimerization, as well as interaction with Tpr and α-actinin-4. The association of SLK with Tpr and α-actinin-4, respectively, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Subsets of total cellular SLK colocalized with Tpr at the nuclear envelope, and α-actinin-4 in the cytoplasm. Expression of Tpr attenuated activation-specific autophosphorylation of SLK, and blocked SLK-induced apoptosis and AP-1 activity. In contrast to the effect of Tpr, autophosphorylation of SLK was not affected by α-actinin-4. Thus, SLK interacts with Tpr and α-actinin-4 in cells, and these protein–protein interactions may control the subcellular localization and the biological activity of SLK.

Abstract: The role of p53 as modulator of OxPhos and glycolysis was analyzed in HeLa-L (cells containing negligible p53 protein levels) and HeLa-H (p53-overexpressing) human cervix cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia. In normoxia, functional p53, mitochondrial enzyme contents, mitochondrial electrical potential (ΔΨm) and OxPhos flux increased in HeLa-H vs. HeLa-L cells; whereas their glycolytic enzyme contents and glycolysis flux were unchanged. OxPhos provided more than 70% of the cellular ATP and proliferation was abolished by anti-mitochondrial drugs in HeLa-H cells. In hypoxia, both cell proliferations were suppressed, but HeLa-H cells exhibited a significant decrease in OxPhos protein contents, ΔΨm and OxPhos flux. Although glycolytic function was also diminished vs. HeLa-L cells in hypoxia, glycolysis provided more than 60% of cellular ATP in HeLa-H cells. The energy metabolism phenotype of HeLa-H cells was reverted to that of HeLa-L cells by incubating with pifithrin-α, a p53-inhibitor. In normoxia, the energy metabolism phenotype of breast cancer MCF-7 cells was similar to that of HeLa-H cells, whereas p53shRNAMCF-7 cells resembled the HeLa-L cell phenotype. In hypoxia, autophagy proteins and lysosomes contents increased 2–5 times in HeLa-H cells suggesting mitophagy activation. These results indicated that under normoxia p53 up-regulated OxPhos without affecting glycolysis, whereas under hypoxia, p53 down-regulated both OxPhos (severely) and glycolysis (weakly). These p53 effects appeared mediated by the formation of p53-HIF-1α complexes. Therefore, p53 exerts a dual and contrasting regulatory role on cancer energy metabolism, depending on the O2 level.

Abstract: CLOCK-BMAL1 is a key transcription factor complex of the molecular clock system that generates circadian gene expression and physiology in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation of BMAL1 mediates the rapid activation of CLOCK-BMAL1 by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in nuclear foci and also the resetting of the circadian clock. Under physiological conditions, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) assay revealed that CLOCK-BMAL1 rapidly dimerized and formed a ternary complex with CBP in discrete nuclear foci in response to serum stimuli. We found that the formation of this ternary complex requires sumoylation of BMAL1 by SUMO3. These processes were abolished by both the ectopic expression of the SUMP2/3-specific protease, SUSP1, and mutation of the major sumoylation site (Lys259) of BMAL1. Moreover, molecular inhibition of BMAL1 sumoylation abrogated acute Per1 transcription and severely dampened the circadian gene oscillation triggered by clock synchronization stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest that sumoylation plays a critical role in the spatiotemporal co-activation of CLOCK-BMAL1 by CBP for immediate-early Per induction and the resetting of the circadian clock.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photocells using low energy-gap polymers such as poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and modified fullerenes such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (C70-PCBM) show relatively high power conversion efficiency. It is known that the thermal annealing, which effectively improves the photovoltaic performance of BHJ photocells with semi-crystalline polymers such as poly (3-hexylthiophene), is not applicable to BHJ photocells with amorphous-type polymers such as PTB7. In this study, it is found that PTB7:C70-PCBM BHJ photocells degrade shortly at 80°C, which is within the range of the temperature shock cycling test condition specified in IEC 61646, the international standard for testing thin-film photovoltaic module. On the other hand, the photovoltaic performance of PTB7:C70 BHJ photocells composite has been found to significantly improve after the thermal annealing at 160°C. The results strikingly indicate not only that the lack of thermal robustness in PTB7:C70-PCBM BHJ photocells does not mainly arise from the nature of the polymer but the substituents of the fullerene used, but also that neat fullerenes should not be considered as just cheap and nasty substitutes of fullerene derivatives.

Abstract: Fibroblasts are the most abundant cells in connective tissue and, with fibrillar extracellular matrix, form the structural scaffolding of organs. In solid tumors, interaction with cancer cells induces fibroblasts transdifferentiation into an activated form, which become a fundamental part of the tumor stroma. Within tumor microenvironment stromal and cancer cells engage a crosstalk that is mediated by soluble factors, cell–cell contacts and extracellular vesicles trafficking. Here we report that fibroblasts have the ability to transfer a remarkable amount of proteins and lipids to neighboring cells, in an ectosome-dependent fashion, identifying a novel and native property of these cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts show an enhanced production and delivering of ectosomes to cancer cells compared to normal fibroblasts. As a consequence of this phenomenon, tumor cells increase their proliferation rate, indicating that ectosome-mediated trafficking could be a relevant mechanism mediating the trophic function of activated connective tissue on tumor cells.

Abstract: Efficient thin-film solar cells balance the reduced absorption occurring in thin absorber layers by means of various photon management strategies that often involve randomly nanotextured interfaces. We report on broadband absorption enhancement in nanotextured amorphous silicon processed by femtosecond laser materials processing. As identified by micro-Raman spectroscopy and surface profilometry, the absorption of a single femtosecond amplifier laser pulse (30fs, 795nm, 75mJcm−2) creates a thin nanotextured micro-crystalline surface layer. Optical microscopy in transmission and reflection geometry reveals a broadband absorption enhancement in the visual spectrum range for the nanotextured area. Scattered light spectroscopy in combination with spectral interferometry indicates that light trapping for about 100fs is achieved in the femtosecond-laser processed amorphous silicon area and thus is responsible for the observed enhanced absorption and locally enhanced Raman yields. Thus fs-laser materials processing offers an interesting pathway towards advanced photon management in amorphous silicon based thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1. Multiple lines of evidence link AMPK activity to SG biogenesis. First, pharmacological kinase inhibition interfered with SG formation. Second, AMPK-α knockdown combined with in-depth quantitative SG analysis revealed isoform-specific changes of SG characteristics. Third, overexpression of mutant α-subunits further substantiated that AMPK regulates SG parameters. Finally, we identified the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 as an AMPK-α2 binding partner. This interaction is stimulated by stress and notably occurs in SGs. Collectively, our data define the master metabolic regulator AMPK as a novel SG constituent that also controls their biogenesis.

Abstract: Cu–Zn–Sn (CZT) precursors for Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) solar cell were prepared by electrochemical co-deposition method with different metals composition. CZT precursors were preliminary annealed in three different atmospheres in order to obtain homogenous, without pores Cu–Zn–Sn layers. A high crystalline quality CZTSe absorber was synthesised as has been determined by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy methods. CZTSe based solar cells were fabricated and champion cell demonstrated 2.7% efficiency and reached as high as 70% of external quantum efficiency. Scanning electron microscope investigations of CZTSe solar cells cross-section revealed that Mo/CZTSe interface exhibits large voids and local delamination from Mo layer. The back contact issues are detrimental to solar cell performance reducing shunt resistance and open circuit voltage.

Abstract: Background
Platinum compounds are potent anticancer drugs but also evoke considerable normal tissue damage. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to the nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin.
Methods
We comparatively investigated the stress responses of rat kidney tubular (NRK-52E) and glomerular cells (RGE) following treatment with cisplatin (CisPt), oxaliplatin (OxaliPt) and carboplatin (CarboPt). To this end, cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, DNA damage response (DDR) and repair of DNA adducts were investigated.
Results
CisPt reduced the viability of tubular NRK-52E and glomerular RGE cells most efficiently. Cytotoxicity evoked by CarboPt occurred with a delay, which might be related to a retarded formation of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks. RGE cells were more sensitive towards all platinum compounds than NRK-52E cells. Platinum drugs efficiently induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in tubular cells, while RGE cells favored G2/M arrest when treated with equitoxic platinum doses. Mitotic index of NKR-52E and RGE cells was worst affected by OxaliPt. Activation of the DDR was strikingly agent- and cell type-specific. Most comprehensive and substantial stimulation of DDR mechanisms was provoked by CisPt. Repair of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks was best in RGE, which was reflected by high mRNA expression of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors.
Conclusions
There are substantial differences regarding the cause of sensitivity and mechanisms of DDR between tubular and glomerular cells following platinum injury. CisPt is the most potent stimulator of the DDR. We hypothesize that specific DNA adducts and thereby forcefully activated pro-toxic DDR mechanisms contribute to the exceptionally high acute nephrotoxicity of CisPt.

Abstract: Prion protein (PrP) mislocalized in the cytosol has been presumed to be the toxic entity responsible for the neurodegenerative process in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), also called prion diseases. The mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of cytosolic PrP (cytoPrP) remains, however, unresolved. In this study we analyze toxic effects of the cell-penetrating PrP fragment, PrP1–30 — encompassing residues responsible for binding and aggregation of tubulin. We have found that intracellularly localized PrP1-30 disassembles microtubular cytoskeleton of primary neurons, which leads to the loss of neurites and, eventually, necrotic cell death. Accordingly, stabilization of microtubules by taxol reduced deleterious effects of cytosolic PrP1–30. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that decreased phosphorylation level of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which also increases stability of microtubular cytoskeleton, protects neurons from the toxic effects of PrP1–30. CHIR98014 and LiCl — inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a major kinase responsible for phosphorylation of MAPs, inhibited PrP1-30-induced disruption of microtubular cytoskeleton and increased viability of peptide-treated neurons. We have also shown that the N-terminal fragment of cytoPrP may cause the loss of dendritic spines. PrP1–30-induced changes at the level of spines have also been prevented by stabilization of microtubules by taxol as well as LiCl. These observations indicate that the neurotoxicity of cytoPrP is tightly linked to the disruption of microtubular cytoskeleton. Importantly, this study implies that lithium, the commonly used mood stabilizer, may be a promising therapeutic agent in TSE, particularly in case of the disease forms associated with accumulation of cytoPrP.

Abstract: Superoleophilic graphene–nickel foam (PDMS–G–NF), which was prepared by coating graphene nanosheets onto nickel foam followed by surface modification with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was used as porous supporting material to prepare form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) composites. Owing to the strong hydrophobic and superhydrophilic wettability of PDMS–G–NF, PCMs can be absorbed spontaneously into PDMS–G–NF and can stay stable without leakage even over their melting points. The incorporation of PCMs into PDMS–G–NF does not change the crystal structure but lowers the crystallinity size of PCMs in the composites, which is confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The latent heat of PDMS–G–NF/PCM composites was measured in the range of 42.3–123.41kJkg−1. Taking advantages of the simple process and good stability the PDMS–G–NF should be ideal candidates as an alternative to traditional PCMs, which may have great potentials for renewable energy saving applications.

Abstract: The fluid mosaic model of Singer and Nicolson correctly predicted that the plasma membrane (PM) forms a lipid bi-layer containing many integral trans-membrane proteins. This model also suggested that most of these proteins were randomly dispersed and freely diffusing moieties. Initially, this view of a dynamic and rather unorganized membrane was supported by early observations of the cell surfaces using the light microscope. However, recent studies on the PM below the diffraction limit of visible light (~250nm) revealed that, at nanoscale dimensions, membranes are highly organized and compartmentalized structures. Lymphocytes are particularly useful to study this nanoscale membrane organization because they grow as single cells and are not permanently engaged in cell:cell contacts within a tissue that can influence membrane organization. In this review, we describe the methods that can be used to better study the protein:protein interaction and nanoscale organization of lymphocyte membrane proteins, with a focus on the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Furthermore, we discuss the factors that may generate and maintain these membrane structures.

Abstract: Moderate hyperoxic exposure in preterm infants contributes to subsequent airway dysfunction and to risk of developing recurrent wheeze and asthma. The regulatory mechanisms that can contribute to hyperoxia-induced airway dysfunction are still under investigation. Recent studies in mice show that hyperoxia increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that increases airway smooth muscle (ASM) proliferation and contractility. We assessed the mechanisms underlying effects of moderate hyperoxia (50% O2) on BDNF expression and secretion in developing human ASM. Hyperoxia increased BDNF secretion, but did not alter endogenous BDNF mRNA or intracellular protein levels. Exposure to hyperoxia significantly increased [Ca2+]i responses to histamine, an effect blunted by the BDNF chelator TrkB-Fc. Hyperoxia also increased ASM cAMP levels, associated with reduced PDE4 activity, but did not alter protein kinase A (PKA) activity or adenylyl cyclase mRNA levels. However, 50% O2 increased expression of Epac2, which is activated by cAMP and can regulate protein secretion. Silencing RNA studies indicated that Epac2, but not Epac1, is important for hyperoxia-induced BDNF secretion, while PKA inhibition did not influence BDNF secretion. In turn, BDNF had autocrine effects of enhancing ASM cAMP levels, an effect inhibited by TrkB and BDNF siRNAs. Together, these novel studies suggest that hyperoxia can modulate BDNF secretion, via cAMP-mediated Epac2 activation in ASM, resulting in a positive feedback effect of BDNF-mediated elevation in cAMP levels. The potential functional role of this pathway is to sustain BDNF secretion following hyperoxic stimulus, leading to enhanced ASM contractility and proliferation.

Abstract: Inhomogeneous broadening and red-edge effects have been detected on a highly mobile system of fluorescently conjugated mAbs targeted to cell surface receptors. By exploiting site-selective spectroscopy and the characteristic loss of homo-FRET on increasing excitation and decreasing emission wavelengths, contributions of physical rotation and homo-FRET to the depolarization of fluorescence anisotropy have been separated. Absolute homo-FRET efficiency has been determined by ratioing two anisotropies: a homo-FRET-sensitive one, which is excited at the absorption main band and detected at the long wavelength region of emission, and a homo-FRET-insensitive one, which is excited at the long wavelength region of absorption and detected at the short wavelength region of emission. Because the anisotropies are simultaneously detected in a unified detection scheme of a dual T-format arrangement, the method is applicable for the real-time tracking of dynamical changes of physical rotations and proximities. The utility of the method is demonstrated in the context of the MHCII molecule and the heavy and light chains of the MHCI molecule, a system of three receptors with well-characterized close mutual proximities. Although the method is presented for a flow cytometer, it can also be realized in a fluorescence microscope capable for dual-laser excitation and dual-anisotropy detection.

Abstract: The intracellular cytoskeleton is an active dynamic network of filaments and associated binding proteins that control key cellular properties, such as cell shape and mechanics. Due to the inherent complexity of the cell, reconstituted model systems have been successfully employed to gain an understanding of the fundamental physics governing cytoskeletal processes. Here, we review recent advances and key aspects of these reconstituted systems. We focus on the importance of assembly kinetics and dynamic arrest in determining network mechanics, and highlight novel emergent behavior occurring through interactions between cytoskeletal components in more complex networks incorporating multiple biopolymers and molecular motors.

Abstract: Abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates form paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles, a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble total tau and phospho-tau from clinically diagnosed AD patients are significantly higher compared with controls. Data from both in vitro and in vivo AD models have implied that an aberrant increase of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling may be a causative factor for the formation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. In the present study, we showed that in post-mortem human AD brain, tau was localized within different organelles (autophagic vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, and mitochondria). In human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably carrying different genetic variants of mTor, we found a common link between the synthesis and distribution of intracellular tau. mTor overexpression or the lack of its expression was responsible for the altered balance of phosphorylated (p-)/-non phosphorylated (Np-) tau in the cytoplasm and different cellular compartments, which might facilitate tau deposition. Up-regulated mTor activity resulted in a significant increase in the amount of cytosolic tau as well as its re-localization to exocytotic vesicles that were not associated with exosomes. These results have implicated that mTor is involved in regulating tau distribution in subcellular organelles and in the initiation of tau secretion from cells to extracellular space.

Abstract: Breast cancer metastasis to the bone, potentially facilitated by chemotactic and angiogenic cytokines, contributes to a dramatic osteolytic effect associated with this invasive behavior. Based on the intrinsic ability of calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) to control hormonal secretion and considering its expression in the breast, we hypothesized that CaSR plays a chemotactic and proangiogenic role in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by promoting secretion of multiple cytokines. In this study, we show that MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with R-568 calcimimetic and extracellular calcium secreted multiple cytokines and growth factors that induced endothelial cell migration and in vitro angiogenesis. These effects were dependent on the activity of CaSR as demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of either anti-CaSR blocking monoclonal antibodies or calcilytic NPS-2143. Moreover, CaSR knockdown prevented the proangiogenic effect of CaSR agonists. Importantly, CaSR promoted secretion of pleiotropic molecules like GM-CSF, EGF, MDC/CCL22, FGF-4 and IGFBP2, all known to be chemotactic mediators with putative angiogenic factor properties. In contrast, constitutive secretion of IL-6 and β-NGF was attenuated by CaSR. In the case of normal mammary cells, secretion of IL-6 was stimulated by CaSR, whereas a constitutive secretion of RANTES, Angiogenin and Oncostatin M was attenuated by this receptor. Taken together, our results indicate that an altered secretion of chemotactic and proangiogenic cytokines in breast cancer cells is modulated by CaSR, which can be considered a potential target in the therapy of metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: The Ste20-like kinase SLK plays a pivotal role in cell migration and focal adhesion turnover and is regulated by the LIM domain-binding proteins Ldb1 and Ldb2. These adapter proteins have been demonstrated to interact with LMO4 in the organization of transcriptional complexes. Therefore, we have assessed the ability of LMO4 to also interact and regulate SLK activity. Our data show that LMO4 can directly bind to SLK and activate its kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. LMO4 can be co-precipitated with SLK following the induction of cell migration by scratch wounding and Cre-mediated deletion of LMO4 in conditional LMO4fl/fl fibroblasts inhibits cell migration and SLK activation. Deletion of LMO4 impairs Ldb1 and SLK recruitment to the leading edge of migrating cells. Supporting this, Src/Yes/Fyn-deficient cells (SYF) expressing very low levels of LMO4 do not recruit SLK to the leading edge. Re-expression of wildtype Myc–LMO4 in SYF cells, but not a mutant version, restores SLK localization and kinase activity. Overall, our data suggest that activation of SLK by haptotactic signals requires its recruitment to the leading edge by LMO4 in a Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, this establishes a novel cytosolic role for the transcriptional co-activator LMO4.

Abstract: Enhanced visible-light absorption of TiO2 with different concentrations of N, Co, or Na monodopants is explored with the use of density functional theory with Hubbard U on-site correction. The effects of dopant concentrations on the absorption are determined. The results show that the absorption efficacy of TiO2 can be tuned into the visible-light range by substituting the Ti atoms with N atoms, in which a strong peak of red-light absorption is found at the concentration of 4.38%. Substituting Co or Na at Ti atom site can also enhance visible-light absorption, and significant effect is achieved when the Co and Na concentrations reach 18.45% and 7.20%, respectively. The mechanism is elucidated on the basis of the electronic structure. We used Na, when we investigated the effects of doping methods on the absorption coefficient and electronic properties. The results proved helpful information for designing and preparing solar energy materials based on doped TiO2.

Abstract: MUC1 is an oncogenic mucin overexpressed in several epithelial cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and is considered as a potent target for cancer therapy. To control cancer progression, miRNAs became very recently, major targets and tools to inhibit oncogene expression. Inhibiting MUC1 using miRNAs appears thus as an attractive strategy to reduce cancer progression. However, potent miRNAs and associated mechanisms regulating MUC1 expression remain to be identified. To this aim, we undertook to study MUC1 regulation by miRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells and identify those with tumor suppressive activity. MiRNAs potentially targeting the 3′-UTR, the coding region, or the 5′-UTR of MUC1 were selected using an in silico approach. Our invitro and invivo experiments indicate that miR-29a and miR-330-5p are strong inhibitors of MUC1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells through direct binding to MUC1 3′-UTR. MUC1 regulation by the other selected miRNAs (miR-183, miR-200a, miR-876-3p and miR-939) was found to be indirect. MiR-29a and miR-330-5p are also deregulated in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and tissues and in pancreatic tissues of KrasG12D mice. In vitro, miR-29a and miR-330-5p inhibit cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion and sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. In vivo intra-tumoral injection of these two miRNAs in xenografted pancreatic tumors led to reduced tumor growth. Altogether, we have identified miR-29a and miR-330-5p as two new tumor suppressive miRNAs that inhibit the expression of MUC1 oncogenic mucin in pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex) is the general entry gate into mitochondria for almost all imported proteins. A variety of specific receptors allow the TOM complex to recognize targeting signals of various precursor proteins that are transported along different import pathways. Aside from the well-characterized presequence receptors Tom20 and Tom22 a third TOM receptor, Tom70, binds proteins of the carrier family containing multiple transmembrane segments. Here we demonstrate that Tom70 directly binds to presequence peptides using a dedicated groove. A single point mutation in the cavity of this pocket (M551R) reduces the presequence binding affinity of Tom70 ten-fold and selectively impairs import of the presequence-containing precursor Mdl1 but not the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC). Hence Tom70 contributes to the presequence import pathway by recognition of the targeting signal of the Mdl1 precursor.

Abstract: Structural and electrical properties of the CuO films and the ZnO/CuO heterojunctions prepared by chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique involving thermal annealing process were studied by scanning electron microscope observation, X-ray diffraction, current density-voltage (J-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. The as-grown CuO films showed p-type conduction after annealing in the air at temperatures (TA) ranging from 200 to 300°C. The n-ZnO/p-CuO heterojunctions were composed of the columnar CuO grains and the ZnO nanorods (NRs) and their J-V curves exhibited rectifying characteristics with large diode ideality factors (n) and leakage currents. The insertion of the ZnO intermediate layer prepared by dip-coating (denoted by “Dip-coating ZnO”) between the ZnO and CuO layers was found to be effective for reducing the n value and suppressing the leakage current. The threshold voltage (Vth), built-in potential (Vbi) and n value of the ZnO/Dip-coating ZnO/CuO heterojunction were strongly dependent on TA and showed minima around TA=250–300°C. Taking into account the fact that the rectification ratios of the forward current to the reverse current were very low at the same TA region, the low Vth and Vbi values are attributed to the tunneling process through the interface states introduced by the structural imperfection.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons. Mitochondria are believed to be responsible for cellular Mg2+ homeostasis. Mg2+ is indispensable for maintaining ordinal cellular functions, hence perturbation of the cellular Mg2+ homeostasis may be responsible for the disorders of physiological functions and diseases including PD. However, the changes in intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) and the role of Mg2+ in PD have still been obscure. In this study, we investigated [Mg2+]i and its effect on neurodegeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) model of PD in differentiated PC12 cells. Application of MPP+ induced an increase in [Mg2+]i immediately via two different pathways: Mg2+ release from mitochondria and Mg2+ influx across cell membrane, and the increased [Mg2+]i sustained for more than 16h after MPP+ application. Suppression of Mg2+ influx decreased the viability of the cells exposed to MPP+. The cell viability correlated highly with [Mg2+]i. In the PC12 cells with suppressed Mg2+ influx, ATP concentration decreased and the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased after an 8h exposure to MPP+. Our results indicate that the increase in [Mg2+]i inhibited cellular ROS generation and maintained ATP production, which resulted in the protection from MPP+ toxicity.

Abstract: The non-canonical IKK kinase TBK1 serves as an important signal transmitter of the antiviral interferon response, but is also involved in the regulation of further processes such as autophagy. The activity of TBK1 is regulated by posttranslational modifications comprising phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This study identifies SUMOylation as a novel posttranslational TBK1 modification. TBK1 kinase activity is required to allow the attachment of SUMO1 or SUMO2/3 proteins. Since TBK1 does not bind to the E2 enzyme Ubc9, this modification most likely proceeds via trans-SUMOylation. Mass spectrometry allowed identifying K694 as the SUMO acceptor site, a residue located in the C-terminal coiled-coil domain which is exclusively responsible for the association with the adaptor proteins NAP1, Sintbad and TANK. SUMO modification at K694 contributes to the antiviral function of TBK1 and accordingly the viral protein Gam1 antagonizes this posttranslational modification.

8-Dehydrosterols induce membrane traffic and autophagy defects through V-ATPase dysfunction in Saccharomyces cerevisae,

Abstract: 8-Dehydrosterols are present in a wide range of biologically relevant situations, from human rare diseases to amine fungicide-treated fungi and crops. However, the molecular bases of their toxicity are still obscure. We show here that 8-dehydrosterols, but not other sterols, affect yeast vacuole acidification through V-ATPases. Moreover, erg2Δ cells display reductions in proton pumping rates consistent with ion-transport uncoupling in vitro. Concomitantly, subunit Vph1p shows conformational changes in the presence of 8-dehydrosterols. Expression of a plant vacuolar H+-pumping pyrophosphatase as an alternative H+-pump relieves Vma−-like phenotypes in erg2Δ-derived mutant cells. As a consequence of these acidification defects, endo- and exo-cytic traffic deficiencies that can be alleviated with a H+-pumping pyrophosphatase are also observed. Despite their effect on membrane traffic, 8-dehydrosterols do not induce endoplasmic reticulum stress or assembly defects on the V-ATPase. Autophagy is a V-ATPase dependent process and erg2Δ mutants accumulate autophagic bodies under nitrogen starvation similar to Vma− mutants. In contrast to classical Atg− mutants, this defect is not accompanied by impairment of traffic through the CVT pathway, processing of Pho8Δ60p, GFP-Atg8p localisation or difficulties to survive under nitrogen starvation conditions, but it is concomitant to reduced vacuolar protease activity. All in all, erg2Δ cells are autophagy mutants albeit some of their phenotypic features differ from classical Atg− defective cells. These results may pave the way to understand the aetiology of sterol-related diseases, the cytotoxic effect of amine fungicides, and may explain the tolerance to these compounds observed in plants.

Fascin actin bundling controls podosome turnover and disassembly while cortactin is involved in podosome assembly by its SH3 domain in THP-1 macrophages and dendritic cells,

Abstract: Podosomes are dynamic degrading devices present in myeloid cells among other cell types. They consist of an actin core with associated regulators, surrounded by an adhesive ring. Both fascin and cortactin are known constituents but the role of fascin actin bundling is still unclear and cortactin research rather focuses on its homologue hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein-1 (HS1). A fascin nanobody (FASNb5) that inhibits actin bundling and a cortactin nanobody (CORNb2) specifically targeting its Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain were used as unique tools to study the function of these regulators in podosome dynamics in both THP-1 macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). Upon intracellular FASNb5 expression, the few podosomes present were aberrantly stable, long-living and large, suggesting a role for fascin actin bundling in podosome turnover and disassembly. Fascin modulates this by balancing the equilibrium between branched and bundled actin networks. In the presence of CORNb2, the few podosomes formed show disrupted structures but their dynamics were unaffected. This suggests a role of the cortactin SH3 domain in podosome assembly. Remarkably, both nanobody-induced podosome-losses were compensated for by focal adhesion structures. Furthermore, matrix degradation capacities were altered and migratory phenotypes were lost. In conclusion, the cortactin SH3 domain contributes to podosome assembly while fascin actin bundling is a master regulator of podosome disassembly in THP-1 macrophages and DC.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) is a member of the defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase family which lacks catalytic activity. Expression of PTK7 is increased in various cancers but its role in carcinogenesis is not well understood. We previously showed that disruption of PTK7 function suppresses VEGF-induced angiogenic phenotypes in HUVECs and mice. Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms for modulating VEGF-induced physiological effects by PTK7. Treatment with a high concentration of extracellular domain of PTK7 (soluble PTK7; sPTK7) or knockdown of PTK7 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) but did not inhibit phosphorylation of fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT-1) in HUVECs. PTK7, more specifically sPTK7, interacted with KDR but not with FLT-1 in HUVECs and HEK293 cells. In vitro binding assay showed that sPTK7 formed oligomers with the extracellular domain of KDR (sKDR) up to an approximately 1:3 molar ratio, and vice versa. sPTK7 at lower molar ratios than sKDR enhanced the binding of VEGF to sKDR. At the same or higher molar ratios, it reduced the binding of VEGF to sKDR. Increasing concentrations of sPTK7 or increasing levels of PTK7 expression first increased and then decreased VEGF-induced KDR phosphorylation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation of HUVECs, as well as in vivo angiogenesis. Taken together, our data demonstrates that PTK7 regulates the activity of KDR biphasically by inducing oligomerization of KDR molecules at lower concentrations and by surrounding KDR molecules at higher concentrations.

Abstract: Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an evolutionarily conserved pH-dependent Ca2+ leak channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and the founding member of a family of six highly hydrophobic mammalian proteins named transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing (TMBIM) 1-6 with BI-1 being TMBIM6. Here we compared the structure, subcellular localization, tissue expression and the effect on the cellular Ca2+ homeostasis of all family members side by side. We found that all TMBIM proteins possess the di-aspartyl pH sensor responsible for pH sensing identified in TMBIM6 and its bacterial homologue BsYetJ. TMBIM1-3 and TMBIM4-6 represent two phylogenetically distinct groups that are localized in the Golgi apparatus (TMBIM1-3), endoplasmic reticulum (TMBIM4-6) or mitochondria (TMBIM5) but share a common structure of at least seven transmembrane domains with the last domain being semi-hydrophobic. TMBIM1 is mainly expressed in muscle, TMBIM2 and 3 in the nervous system, TMBIM4 and 5 are ubiquitously expressed and TMBIM6 in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver and spleen. All TMBIM proteins reduce the Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum, and all but TMBIM5 also reduce the cytosolic resting Ca2+ concentration. These results suggest that the TMBIM family has comparable functions in the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in a wide variety of tissues.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key organelle fundamental for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the determination of cell fate under stress conditions. Reticulon-1C (RTN-1C) is a member of the reticulon family proteins localized primarily on the ER membrane and known to regulate ER structure and function. Several cellular processes depend on the structural and functional crosstalk between different organelles, particularly on the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. These dynamic contacts, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), are essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and participate in lipid and calcium exchanges between the two organelles. In this study we investigated the impact of RTN-1C modulation on mitochondrial dynamics. We demonstrate that RTN-1C controls mitochondrial structure and function affecting intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and lipid exchange between ER and mitochondria. We propose that these events depend on RTN-1C involvement in the regulation of ER–mitochondria cross-talk and define a role for RTN-1C in maintaining the function of contacts between the two organelles.

Abstract: Solution-based processing is a rapidly growing area in the electronics and photonics field due to the possibility of reducing fabrication costs of materials for solar cells, transistors, memory and many other devices. Moreover thanks to its intrinsic nature it provides the possibility to perform conformal processing on structured surfaces. Most of the solution-processing work has so far been devoted to organic materials, but in this work an approach focused on nanostructured silicon is presented. The idea consists in the immersion of a silicon wafer, with Si nanowires grown on top, in a chemical bath containing dopant precursors molecules diluted in a solvent. The molecules deposit from the liquid all over the exposed surfaces and work as a dopant source for the Si nanowires during successive thermal annealing. Doping levels of 1×1019cm−3 are controllably obtained without structural damage and hetero-interfaces creation. The Si-NWs array used presents density of 2×1010cm−2, average length of 500nm and diameters up to 70nm. The doped Si-NWs are then integrated in complete solar cells which have been electrically characterized. It is found that the molecular doping method applied to the SiNW arrays provides higher short circuit current and fill factor than the reference samples.

Abstract: The human amino acid transporter SLC1A5 (ASCT2) contains two N-glycosylation sites (N163 and N212) located in the large extracellular loop. In the homology structural model of ASCT2 these Asn residues are extracellularly exposed. Mutants of the two Asn exhibited altered electrophoretic mobility. N163Q and N212Q displayed multiple bands with apparent molecular masses from 80kDa to 50kDa. N163/212Q displayed a single band of 50kDa corresponding to the unglycosylated protein. The presence in membrane of WT and mutants was evaluated by protein biotinylation assay followed by immunoblotting. The double mutation significantly impaired the presence of the protein in membrane, without impairment in protein synthesis. [3H]glutamine transport was measured in cells transiently transfected with the WT or mutants. N163/212Q exhibited a strongly reduced transport activity correlating with reduced surface expression. The same proteins extracted from cells and reconstituted in liposomes showed comparable transport activities demonstrating that the intrinsic transport function of the mutants was not affected. The rate of endocytosis of ASCT2 was assayed by a reversible biotinylation strategy. N212Q and N163/212Q showed strongly increased rates of endocytosis respect to WT. ASCT2 stability was determined using cycloheximide. N163Q or N163/212Q showed a slightly or significantly lower stability with respect to WT. To assess trafficking to the membrane, a brefeldin-based assay, which caused retention of proteins in ER, was performed. One hour after brefeldin removal WT protein was localized to the plasma membrane while the double mutant was localized in the cytosol. The results demonstrate that N-glycosylation is critical for trafficking.

Abstract: In a comparative study a novel class of pentaarylazafullerene derivatives is investigated as acceptor material in solution-processed organic solar cells. Due to their raised lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) compared to phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) the orbital matching to P3HT is optimized so that an increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared to the standard PC61BM acceptor is gained. However, the performance of pentaarylazafullerene solar cells is limited by rather low short circuit currents (JSC) and fill factors (FF) which can be partially improved by using 1-methylnaphtalene as additive. Within this series the azafullerenes with phenoxyphenyl and phenoxymethyl addends 1 and 3 show the best results with encouraging VOCs of >800mV and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 0.9%.

Characterising the association of latency with α1-antitrypsin polymerisation using a novel monoclonal antibody,

Abstract: α1-Antitrypsin is primarily synthesised in the liver, circulates to the lung and protects pulmonary tissues from proteolytic damage. The Z mutant (Glu342Lys) undergoes inactivating conformational change and polymerises. Polymers are retained within the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in homozygous (PiZZ) individuals, predisposing the individuals to hepatic cirrhosis and emphysema. Latency is an analogous process of inactivating, intra-molecular conformational change and may co-occur with polymerisation. However, the relationship between latency and polymerisation remained unexplored in the absence of a suitable probe. We have developed a novel monoclonal antibody specific for latent α1-antitrypsin and used it in combination with a polymer-specific antibody, to assess the association of both conformers in vitro, in disease and during augmentation therapy. In vitro kinetics analysis showed polymerisation dominated the pathway but latency could be promoted by stabilising monomeric α1-antitrypsin. Polymers were extensively produced in hepatocytes and a cell line expressing Z α1-antitrypsin but the latent protein was not detected despite manipulation of the secretory pathway. However, α1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy contains latent α1-antitrypsin, as did the plasma of 63/274 PiZZ individuals treated with augmentation therapy but 0/264 who were not receiving this medication (p<10−14). We conclude that latent α1-antitrypsin is a by-product of the polymerisation pathway, that the intracellular folding environment is resistant to formation of the latent conformer but that augmentation therapy introduces latent α1-antitrypsin into the circulation. A suite of monoclonal antibodies and methodologies developed in this study can characterise α1-antitrypsin folding and conformational transitions, and screen methods to improve augmentation therapy.

Abstract: Iron is an essential nutrient which must be provided in sufficient amounts to support growth of eukaryotic cells. All organisms devote specialized pathways to ensure proper delivery. Yet, a quantitative assessment of the intra-cellular iron concentration needed to allow the cell cycle to proceed in mammalian cells is missing. Starting from iron-depleted cell lines or primary hematopoietic progenitors prepared with clinically implemented iron chelators, replenishment via transferrin and other iron sources has been quantitatively monitored through the main endogenous markers of the cellular iron status, namely proteins involved in the uptake (transferrin receptor), the storage (ferritin), and the sensing (Iron Regulatory Proteins) of iron. When correlated with measurements of iron concentrations and indicators of growth, this minimally intrusive approach provided an unprecedented estimate of the intracellular iron concentration acting upon iron-centered regulatory pathways. The data were analyzed with the help of a previously developed theoretical treatment of cellular iron regulation. The minimal cellular iron concentration required for cell division was named functional iron concentration (FIC) to distinguish it from previous estimates of the cellular labile iron. The FIC falls in the low nanomolar range for all studied cells, including hematopoietic progenitors. These data shed new light on basic aspects of cellular iron homeostasis by demonstrating that sensing and regulation of iron occur well below the concentrations requiring storage or becoming noxious in pathological conditions. The quantitative assessment provided here is relevant for monitoring treatments of conditions in which iron provision must be controlled to avoid unwanted cellular proliferation.

Abstract: The role of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) is essential for determining stem cell functions. Eph/Ephrin interactions are important for regulation of stem cell fate and localization within their niche, which is significant for a wide range of stem cell behavior. Although oleic acid (OA) and Ephrin receptors (Ephs) have critical roles in the maintenance of stem cell functions, interrelation between Ephs and OA has not been explored. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of OA-pretreated UCB-MSCs in skin wound-healing and underlying mechanism of Eph expression. OA promoted the motility of UCB-MSCs via EphB2 expression. OA-mediated GPR40 activation leads to Gαq-dependent PKCα phosphorylation. In addition, OA-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β was followed by β-catenin nuclear translocation in UCB-MSCs. Activation of β-catenin was blocked by PKC inhibitors, and OA-induced EphB2 expression was suppressed by β-cateninsiRNA transfection. Of those Rho-GTPases, Rac1 was activated in an EphB2-dependent manner. Accordingly, knocking down EphB2 suppressed F-actin expression. In vivo skin wound-healing assay revealed that OA-treated UCB-MSCs enhanced skin wound repair compared to UCB-MSCs pretreated with EphB2siRNA and OA. In conclusion, we showed that OA enhances UCB-MSC motility through EphB2-dependent F-actin formation involving PKCα/GSK3β/β-catenin and Rac1 signaling pathways.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with the non-selective cation channels TRPC6 but the functional consequences of this association are unknown. Experiments performed with HEK cells over-expressing TRPC6 channels showed that inhibiting the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase with ouabain reduced the amount of TRPC6 proteins and depressed Ca2+ entry through TRPC6. This effect, not mimicked by membrane depolarization with KCl, was abolished by sucrose and bafilomycin-A, and was partially sensitive to the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM. Biotinylation and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that ouabain caused a multifaceted redistribution of TRPC6 to the plasma membrane and to an endo/lysosomal compartment where they were degraded. The amyloid beta peptide Aβ1–40, another inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase, but not the shorter peptide Aβ1–16, reduced TRPC6 protein levels and depressed TRPC6-mediated responses. In cortical neurons from embryonic mice, ouabain, veratridine (an opener of voltage-gated Na+ channel), and Aβ1–40 reduced TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ responses whereas Aβ1–16 was ineffective. Furthermore, when Aβ1–40 was co-added together with zinc acetate it could no longer control TRPC6 activity. Altogether, this work shows the existence of a functional coupling between the Na+/K+-ATPase and TRPC6. It also suggests that the abundance, distribution and activity of TRPC6 can be regulated by cardiotonic steroids like ouabain and the naturally occurring peptide Aβ1–40 which underlines the pathophysiological significance of these processes.

Abstract: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports a variety of chemically dissimilar amphipathic compounds including anticancer drugs. Although mechanisms of P-gp drug transport are widely studied, the pathways involving its internalization are poorly understood. The present study is aimed at elucidating the pathways involved in degradation of cell surface P-gp. The fate of P-gp at the cell surface was determined by biotinylating cell surface proteins followed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Our data shows that the half-life of endogenously expressed P-gp is 26.7±1.1h in human colorectal cancer HCT-15 cells. Treatment of cells with Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) a vacuolar H+ ATPase inhibitor increased the half-life of P-gp at the cell surface to 36.1±0.5h. Interestingly, treatment with the proteasomal inhibitors MG132, MG115 or lactacystin alone did not alter the half-life of the protein. When cells were treated with both lysosomal and proteasomal inhibitors (BafA1 and MG132), the half-life was further prolonged to 39–50h. Functional assays done with rhodamine 123 or calcein-AM, fluorescent substrates of P-gp, indicated that the transport function of P-gp was not affected by either biotinylation or treatment with BafA1 or proteasomal inhibitors. Immunofluorescence studies done with the antibody against lysosomal marker LAMP1 and the P-gp-specific antibody UIC2 in permeabilized cells indicated that intracellular P-gp is primarily localized in the lysosomal compartment. Our results suggest that the lysosomal degradation system could be targeted to increase the sensitivity of P-gp- expressing cancer cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs.

Abstract: O-GlcNAcylation is highly involved in cellular stress responses including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. For example, glucosamine-induced flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway can promote ER stress and ER stress inducers can change the total cellular level of O-GlcNAcylation. However, it is largely unknown which component(s) of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is directly regulated by O-GlcNAcylation. In this study, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), a major branch of the UPR, was O-GlcNAcylated at Ser 219, Thr 239, and Thr 241. Upon ER stress, eIF2α is phosphorylated at Ser 51 by phosphorylated PKR-like ER kinase and this inhibits global translation initiation, except for that of specific mRNAs, including activating transcription factor 4, that induce stress-responsive genes such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Hyper-O-GlcNAcylation induced by O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (thiamet-G) treatment or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) overexpression hindered phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser 51. The level of O-GlcNAcylation of eIF2α was changed by dithiothreitol treatment dependent on its phosphorylation at Ser 51. Point mutation of the O-GlcNAcylation sites of eIF2α increased its phosphorylation at Ser 51 and CHOP expression and resulted in increased apoptosis upon ER stress. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of eIF2α affects its phosphorylation at Ser 51 and influences CHOP-mediated cell death. This O-GlcNAcylation of eIF2α was reproduced in thiamet-G-injected mouse liver. In conclusion, proper regulation of O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation of eIF2α is important to maintain cellular homeostasis upon ER stress.

Abstract: Monitoring of autophagy is challenging because of its multiple steps and lack of single befitting technique for a complete mechanistic understanding, which makes the task complicated. Here, we evaluate the functionality of autophagy triggered by salinomycin (anti-cancer stem cell agent) using flow cytometry and advanced microscopy. We show that salinomycin does induce functional autophagy at lower concentrations and such a dose is cell type-dependent. For example, PC3 cells show active autophagic flux at 10μM concentration of salinomycin while murine embryonic fibroblasts already show an inhibition of flux at such doses. A higher concentration of salinomycin (i.e. 30μM) inhibits autophagic flux in both cell types. The data confirms our previous findings that salinomycin is an inducer of autophagy, whereas autophagic flux inhibition is a secondary response.

Abstract: The 0.4μm-thick Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO:Al) films were deposited at 100°C on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates by Radio Frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. Prior to the AZO deposition, an Argon plasma treatment on the substrate surface was carried out by applying a RF bias power on it without intentional heating. The parameters varied in the etching process were the plasma etching time from 0 to 360s, the RF bias power from 50 to 250W, and the gas flux from 3 to 5sccm. The effect of the substrate surface treatment on the mechanical stability, crystallinity and the optoelectronic properties of ZnO:Al thin films were evaluated. The results showed physically stable ZnO:Al films with good adherence to the substrate using appropriated plasma treatment parameters. This fact was attributed to physico/chemical PET surface modifications on the first few molecular layers after the plasma irradiation. The performance of flexible solar devices fabricated on optimized ZnO:Al thin films with adequate adhesion and optoelectronic properties was analysed.

Abstract: Non-planar solar cell devices have been promoted as a means to enhance current collection in absorber materials with charge-transport limitations. This work presents an analytical framework for assessing the ultimate performance of non-planar solar cells based on materials and geometry. Herein, the physics of the p-n junction is analyzed for low-injection conditions, when the junction can be considered spatially separable into quasi-neutral and space-charge regions. For the conventional planar solar cell architecture, previously established one-dimensional expressions governing charge carrier transport are recovered from the framework established herein. Space-charge region recombination statistics are compared for planar and non-planar geometries, showing variations in recombination current produced from the space-charge region. In addition, planar and non-planar solar cell performances are simulated, based on a semi-empirical expression for short-circuit current, detailing variations in charge carrier transport and efficiency as a function of geometry, thereby yielding insights into design criteria for solar cell architectures. For the conditions considered here, the expressions for generation rate and total current are shown to universally govern any solar cell geometry, while recombination within the space-charge region is shown to be directly dependent on the geometrical orientation of the p-n junction.

Acute ethanol induces apoptosis by stimulating TRPC6 via elevation of superoxide in oxygenated podocytes,

Abstract: Our recent studies indicate that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) only at high concentrations can cause oxidative stress in renal epithelial cells and induce apoptosis of podocytes. Consistently, the present study shows that H2O2, even at 1mM, failed to induce intracellular oxidative stress and apoptosis of the podocytes due to efficient activity of catalase, an enzyme which degrades H2O2 to produce water and oxygen (O2). However, H2O2 acted as a source of O2 to allow acute ethanol to induce superoxide production and cause apoptosis of the podocytes. In contrast, acute ethanol alone did not elevate intracellular superoxide, even though it stimulates expression and translocation of p47phox to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of catalase abolished not only O2 production from H2O2 degradation, but also NOX2-dependent superoxide production in the podocytes challenged by both H2O2 and acute ethanol. In parallel, acute ethanol in the presence of H2O2, but neither ethanol nor H2O2 alone, stimulated transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channels and caused TRPC6-dependent elevation of intracellular Ca2+. These data suggest that exogenous H2O2 does not induce oxidative stress due to rapid degradation to produce O2 in the podocytes, but the oxygenated podocytes become sensitive to acute ethanol challenge and undergo apoptosis via a TRPC6-dependent elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Since cultured podocytes are considered in hypoxic conditions, H2O2 may be used as a source of O2 to establish an ischemia–reperfusion model in some type of cultured cells in which H2O2 does not directly induce intracellular oxidative stress.

Abstract: Downregulation of multiple cell cycle-regulatory molecules is a dominant event in TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition of human carcinoma cells. It is known that KLF10 mimics the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects that TGF-β1 has on epithelial cell growth and the growth of various tumor cells; based on these findings it is considered as a tumor suppressor. KLF10 protein expression is tightly associated with cell cycle-dependent events. However, the regulatory mechanism and its biological meaning have not been identified. In this study, we have demonstrated that KLF10 is a substrate of CDK2/cyclin E and can be phosphorylated. We also have shown that KLF10 efficiently binds to CDK2, while binding much less to CDK4, and displaying no binding to Cdk6. Using mass spectrometry, site direct mutagenesis, in vitro kinase assays and depletion assays, we have established that CDK2 phosphorylates Ser206, which subsequently affects the steady state level of KLF10 in cells. Our studies have also proved that CDK2 up-regulates the protein level of KLF10 through reducing its association with SIAH1, a KLF10 E3-ubiqutin ligase involved in proteasomal degradation. Taken all together, these findings indicate that CDK2-dependent phosphorylation regulates KLF10 stability and that this affects the role of KLF10 in cell.

Abstract: Proteostasis is crucial for life and maintained by cellular chaperones and proteases. One major mitochondrial protease is the ClpXP complex, which is comprised of a catalytic ClpX subunit and a proteolytic ClpP subunit. Based on two separate observations, we hypothesized that ClpX may play a leading role in the cellular function of ClpXP. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of ClpX overexpression on a myoblast proteome by quantitative proteomics. ClpX overexpression results in the upregulation of markers of the mitochondrial proteostasis pathway, known as the “mitochondrial unfolded protein response” (UPRmt). Although this pathway is described in detail in Caenorhabditis elegans, it is not clear whether it is conserved in mammals. Therefore, we compared features of the classical nematode UPRmt with our mammalian ClpX-triggered UPRmt dataset. We show that they share the same retrograde mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathway that involves the key UPRmt transcription factor CHOP (also known as Ddit3, CEBPZ or GADD153). In conclusion, our data confirm the existence of a mammalian UPRmt that has great similarity to the C. elegans pathway. Furthermore, our results illustrate that ClpX overexpression is a good and simple model to study the underlying mechanisms of the UPRmt in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films were synthesized by a two-step process involving co-sputtering metallic precursor followed by reactive annealing. Two different techniques of annealing were used, i.e. graphite box and three-zone furnace. Very important differences were observed between the two techniques in terms of Se diffusion through the precursor and reaction path leading to CZTSe formation. Thermodynamic analysis was used in order to explain the reaction mechanism and kinetics of CZTSe formation during the annealing step. The films exhibit large grains with high crystalline quality and solar cells with conversion efficiency of 7.1% were synthesized.

Abstract: Polycrystalline thin film copper chalcogenide solar cells show remarkable efficiencies, and analogous but less-explored semiconducting materials may hold similar promise. With consideration of elemental abundance and process scalability, we explore the potential of the Cu–Sb–S material system for photovoltaic applications. Using a high-throughput combinatorial approach, Cu–Sb–S libraries were synthesized by magnetron co-sputtering of Cu2S and Sb2S3 targets and evaluated by a suite of spatially resolved characterization techniques. The resulting compounds include Cu1.8S (digenite), Cu12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite), CuSbS2 (chalcostibite), and Sb2S3 (stibnite). Of the two ternary phases synthesized, CuSbS2 was found to have the most potential, however, when deposited at low temperatures its electrical conductivity varied by several orders of magnitude due to the presence of impurities. To address this issue, we developed a self-regulated approach to synthesize stoichiometric CuSbS2 films using excess Sb2S3 vapor at elevated substrate temperatures. Theoretical calculations explain that phase-pure CuSbS2 is expected to be formed over a relatively wide range of temperatures and pressures, bound by the sublimation of Sb2S3 and decomposition of CuSbS2. The carrier concentration of CuSbS2 films produced within this regime was tunable from 1016–1018cm−3 through appropriate control of Sb2S3 flux rate and substrate temperature. CuSbS2 displayed a sharp optical absorption onset indicative of a direct transition at 1.5eV and an absorption coefficient of 105cm−1 within 0.3eV of the onset. The results of this study suggest that CuSbS2 holds promise for solar energy conversion due to its tolerant processing window, tunable carrier concentration, solar-matched band gap, and high absorption coefficient.

Abstract: Valosin-containing protein (VCP or p97), a member of the AAA family (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities), plays a key role in many important cellular activities. A genetic deficiency of VCP can cause inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Previous studies showed that the VCP N domain is essential for the regulation of nuclear entry of VCP. Here we report that IBMPFD mutations, which are mainly located in the N domain, suppress the nuclear entry of VCP. Moreover, the peptide sequence G780AGPSQ in the C-terminal region regulates the retention of VCP in the nucleus. A mutant lacking this sequence can increase the nuclear distribution of IBMPFD VCP, suggesting that this sequence is a potential molecular target for correcting the deficient nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of IBMPFD VCP proteins.

Abstract: One of the best-characterized general stress responses in bacteria is the σB-mediated stress response of the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The σB regulon contains approximately 200 protein-encoding genes and 136 putative regulatory RNAs. One of these σB-dependent RNAs, named S1136–S1134, was recently mapped as being transcribed from the S1136 promoter on the opposite strand of the essential rpsD gene, which encodes the ribosomal primary-binding protein S4. Accordingly, S1136–S1134 transcription results in an rpsD-overlapping antisense RNA (asRNA). Upon exposure of B. subtilis to ethanol, the S1136 promoter was found to be induced, while rpsD transcription was downregulated. By quantitative PCR, we show that the activation of transcription from the S1136 promoter is directly responsible for the downregulation of rpsD upon ethanol exposure. We also show that this downregulation of rpsD leads to a reduced level of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit upon ethanol stress. The activation of the S1136 promoter thus represents the first example of antisense transcription-mediated regulation in the general stress response of B. subtilis and implicates the reduction of ribosomal protein abundance as a new aspect in the σB-dependent stress response. We propose that the observed reduction in the level of the small ribosomal subunit, which contains the ribosome-decoding center, may protect B. subtilis cells against misreading and spurious translation of possibly toxic aberrant peptides under conditions of ethanol stress.

Abstract: Nicotinamide (NAM) is the amide of nicotinic acid and a predominant precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis via the salvage pathway. Sirt1 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, playing an important role in regulating cellular functions. Although hepatoprotective effect of NAM has been reported, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. ER stress, induced by saturated fatty acids, in specific palmitate, plays a pathological role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This study aims to determine the effect of NAM on palmitate-induced ER stress in hepatocytes and to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind. Both HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were exposed to palmitate (conjugated to BSA at a 2:1M ratio), NAM, or their combination for different durations. Cellular NAD+ level, Sirt1 expression/activity, ER stress, as well as cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway activation were determined. NAM increased Sirt1 expression and enzymatic activity, which contributes to the ameliorative effect of NAM on palmitate-triggered ER stress. NAM increased intracellular NAD+ level in hepatocytes, however, blocking the salvage pathway, a pathway for NAD+ synthesis from NAM, only partially prevented NAM-induced Sirt1 upregulation while completely prevented NAD+ increase in response to NAM. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that NAM elevated intracellular cAMP level via suppressing PDE activity, leading to downstream PKA and CREB activation. Importantly, cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway blockade abolished not only NAM-induced Sirt1 upregulation, but also its protective effect against ER stress. Our results demonstrate that NAM protects hepatocytes against palmitate-induced ER stress in hepatocytes via upregulating Sirt1. Activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway plays a key role in NAM-induced Sirt1 upregulation.

Abstract: Maskless reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing using a gas mixture of sulfur hexafluoride–oxygen (SF6/O2) and sulfur hexafluoride–oxygen–chlorine (SF6/O2/Cl2) was investigated to reveal the proper shape in surface features for higher efficiency multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells; hence, needle-like and round-top cone (RT cone) shapes were formed by RIE texturing with SF6/O2 gas, and pyramid and inverted pyramid shapes by RIE texturing with SF6/O2/Cl2 gas. RIE-textured mc-Si solar cells were fabricated on these surface features except for an inverted pyramid structure in the industrial production line. Performances of cells with RT cone and pyramid shapes were enhanced, whereas those with a needle-like cone were degraded, compared to the reference cells. Among these cells, those with RT cones represented the highest efficiency at 17.22%. By considering diode characteristics and electroluminescence images of fabricated solar cells, the proper shape for surface features was intimately related to control of the formation of a stable emitter layer as well as the reduction of surface reflectance.

Abstract: Mitochondrial membrane architecture is important for organelle function. Alterations thereof are linked to a number of human disorders including diabetes and cardiomyopathy. The MICOS complex was recently reported to be a central player determining cristae structure and formation of crista junctions. Here we investigated the functional role of MIC26, a lipoprotein formerly termed APOO. Its levels are increased in diabetic heart tissue and in blood plasma of patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. We demonstrate that human MIC26 exists in three distinct forms: (1) a glycosylated and secreted 55kDa protein, (2) an ER/Golgi-resident form thereof, and (3) a non-glycosylated 22kDa mitochondrial protein. The latter isoform spans the mitochondrial inner membrane and physically interacts with several MICOS complex subunits such as MIC60, MIC27, and MIC10. We further demonstrate that MIC26 and MIC27, a homologous protein formerly termed APOOL, regulate their levels in an antagonistic manner. Both proteins are positively correlated with the levels of MIC10 as well as tafazzin, an enzyme required for cardiolipin remodeling. Overexpression of MIC26 induced fragmentation of mitochondria, promoted ROS formation and resulted in impaired mitochondrial respiration. Downregulation of MIC26 induced a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas mitochondrial network morphology and ROS levels remained unaffected. MIC26 depletion led to alterations in mitochondrial ultrastructure and caused a significant reduction in the number of crista junctions. In summary, we show that the human apolipoprotein MIC26 is a bona fide subunit of the MICOS complex and that MIC26 is linked to cardiolipin metabolism and promotes crista junction formation.

Abstract: Rab is a small GTP-binding protein family that regulates various pathways of vesicular transport. Although more than 60 Rab proteins are targeted to specific organelles in mammalian cells, the mechanisms underlying the specificity of Rab proteins for the respective organelles remain unknown. In this study, we reconstituted the Golgi targeting of Rab6A in streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized HeLa cells in a cytosol-dependent manner and investigated the biochemical requirements of targeting. Golgi-targeting assays identified Bicaudal-D (BICD)2, which is reportedly involved in the dynein-mediated transport of mRNAs during oogenesis and embryogenesis in Drosophila, as a cytosolic factor for the Golgi targeting of Rab6A in SLO-permeabilized HeLa cells. Subsequent immunofluorescence analyses indicated decreased amounts of the GTP-bound active form of Rab6 in BICD2-knockdown cells. In addition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses revealed that overexpression of the C-terminal region of BICD2 decreased the exchange rate of GFP–Rab6A between the Golgi membrane and the cytosol. Collectively, these results indicated that BICD2 facilitates the binding of Rab6A to the Golgi by stabilizing its GTP-bound form. Moreover, several analyses of vesicular transport demonstrated that Rab6A and BICD2 play crucial roles in Golgi tubule fusion with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in brefeldin A (BFA)-treated cells, indicating that BICD2 is involved in coat protein I (COPI)-independent Golgi-to-ER retrograde vesicular transport.

Abstract: We study amorphous silicon–germanium (a-SiGe:H) as intrinsic absorber material for thin-film silicon-based triple and quadruple junction solar cells. First, we present the development of a-SiGe:H single junction devices, in particular the Ge-content grading in the absorber layer, the influence of the Ge-content on electrical properties and (infra)red-response, and the influence of using different types of p-layers. We subsequently show the incorporation of optimized single-junction devices in triple junction cells and discuss the interplay between Ge-content and intermediate reflector thickness. For triple junction devices with amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) top cells, a-SiGe:H middle cells and microcrystalline silicion (µc-Si:H) bottom cells, we obtained an initial efficiency of 13.6% and an efficiency of 11.3% after light-soaking. We also present a quadruple junction device with an a-Si:H top cell, a low Ge-content a-SiGe:H second cell, and µc-Si:H third and bottom cells. In this device configuration, we obtained an open-circuit voltage as high as 2.57V. The performance of these cells was limited by not yet optimized current matching, leading nevertheless to an initial efficiency of 10.1%. A brief roadmap towards quadruple-junction devices with stabilized efficiencies of 14% is also outlined.

Abstract: The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, takes up numerous host cytosolic components and exogenous nutrients through endocytosis during the intra-erythrocytic stages. Eps15 homology domain-containing proteins (EHDs) are conserved NTPases, which are implicated in membrane remodeling and regulation of specific endocytic transport steps in eukaryotic cells. In the present study, we have characterized the dynamin-like C-terminal Eps15 homology domain containing protein of P. falciparum (PfEHD). Using a GFP-targeting approach, we studied localization and trafficking of PfEHD in the parasite. The PfEHD-GFP fusion protein was found to be a membrane bound protein that associates with vesicular network in the parasite. Time-lapse microscopy studies showed that these vesicles originate at parasite plasma membrane, migrate through the parasite cytosol and culminate into a large multi-vesicular like structure near the food-vacuole. Co-staining of food vacuole membrane showed that the multi-vesicular structure is juxtaposed but outside the food vacuole. Labeling of parasites with neutral lipid specific dye, Nile Red, showed that this large structure is neutral lipid storage site in the parasites. Proteomic analysis identified endocytosis modulators as PfEHD associated proteins in the parasites. Treatment of parasites with endocytosis inhibitors obstructed the development of PfEHD-labeled vesicles and blocked their targeting to the lipid storage site. Overall, our data suggests that the PfEHD is involved in endocytosis and plays a role in the generation of endocytic vesicles at the parasite plasma membrane, that are subsequently targeted to the neutral lipid generation/storage site localized near the food vacuole.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs when the rate of protein degradation exceeds that of protein synthesis in various catabolic conditions, such as fasting, disuse, aging, and chronic diseases. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling stimulates muscle growth and suppresses muscle protein breakdown. In atrophied muscles, ubiquitin ligase, Cbl-b, increases and stimulates the ubiquitination and degradation of IRS-1, an intermediate in IGF-1 signaling pathway, resulting in IGF-1 resistance. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of atelocollagen (ATCOL)-transported anti-ubiquitination oligopeptide (Cblin: Cbl-b inhibitor) (consisting of tyrosine phosphorylation domain of IRS-1) in starved C2C12 myotubes. The amount of IRS-1 protein was lower in starved versus unstarved myotubes. The Cblin-ATCOL complex inhibited IRS-1 degradation in a concentration-dependent manner. Myotubes incubated with Cblin-ATCOL complex showed significant resistance to starvation-induced atrophy (p<0.01). Furthermore, the Cblin-ATCOL complex significantly inhibited any decrease in Akt phosphorylation (p<0.01) and localization of FOXO3a to the nucleus in starved myotubes. These results suggest that Cblin prevented starvation-induced C2C12 myotube atrophy by maintaining the IGF-1/Akt/FOXO signaling. Therefore, attachment of anti-ubiquitination oligopeptide, Cblin, to ATCOL enhances its delivery to myotubes and could be a potentially effective strategy in the treatment of atrophic myopathies.

Abstract: The tetraspanin CD9 has been shown to interact with different members of the β1 and β3 subfamilies of integrins, regulating through these interactions cell adhesion, migration and signaling. Based on confocal microscopy co-localization and on co-immunoprecipitation results, we report here that CD9 associates with the β2 integrin LFA-1 in different types of leukocytes including T, B and monocytic cells. This association is resistant to stringent solubilization conditions which, together with data from chemical crosslinking, in situ Proximity Ligation Assays and pull-down experiments, suggest a primary/direct type of interaction mediated by the Large Extracellular Loop of the tetraspanin. CD9 exerts inhibitory effects on the adhesive function of LFA-1 and on LFA-1-dependent leukocyte cytotoxic activity. The mechanism responsible for this negative regulation exerted by CD9 on LFA-1 adhesion does not involve changes in the affinity state of this integrin but seems to be related to alterations in its state of aggregation.

Abstract: Hsp90 is an essential chaperone for more than 200 client proteins in eukaryotic cells. The human genome encodes two highly similar cytosolic Hsp90 proteins called Hsp90α and Hsp90β. Most of the client proteins can interact with either Hsp90 protein; however, only a handful client proteins and one co-chaperone that interact specifically with one of the Hsp90 isoforms were identified. Structural differences underlying these isoform-specific interactions were not studied. Here we report for the first time that the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 interacts preferentially with Hsp90α. The distinction depends on the middle domain of Hsp90. The middle domain of Hsp90α is also responsible for the slow growth phenotype of yeasts that express this isoform as a sole source of Hsp90. These results suggest that differences in the middle domain of Hsp90α and Hsp90β may be responsible for the isoform-specific interactions with selected proteins. Also shown here within, we determine that preferential chaperoning of cIAP1 by Hsp90β is mediated by the N-terminal domain of this isoform.

Abstract: We previously reported that overexpression of members of the Importin (Imp) superfamily of nuclear transporters results in increased nuclear trafficking through conventional transport pathways in tumour cells. Here we show for the first time that the extent of overexpression of Impβ1 correlates with disease state in the MCF10 human breast tumour progression system. Excitingly, we find that targeting Impβ1 activity through siRNA is >30 times more efficient in decreasing the viability of malignant ductal carcinoma cells compared to isogenic non-transformed counterparts, and is highly potent and tumour selective at subnanomolar concentrations. Tumour cell selectivity of the siRNA effects was unique to Impβ1 and not other Imps, with flow cytometric analysis showing >60% increased cell death compared to controls concomitant with reduced nuclear import efficiency as indicated by confocal microscopic analysis. This hypersensitivity of malignant cell types to Impβ1 knockdown raises the exciting possibility of anti-cancer therapies targeted at Impβ1.
