Abstract: DDIT3 is a tightly regulated basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor and key regulator in cellular stress responses. It is involved in a variety of pathological conditions and may cause cell cycle block and apoptosis. It is also implicated in differentiation of some specialized cell types and as an oncogene in several types of cancer. DDIT3 was originally believed to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor by forming heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors, preventing their DNA binding and transactivating functions. DDIT3 has, however, been reported to bind DNA and regulate target genes. Here, we employed ChIP sequencing combined with microarray-based expression analysis to identify direct binding motifs and target genes of DDIT3. The results reveal DDIT3 binding to motifs similar to other bZIP transcription factors, known to form heterodimers with DDIT3. Binding to a class III satellite DNA repeat sequence was also detected. DDIT3 acted as a DNA-binding transcription factor and bound mainly to the promotor region of regulated genes. ChIP sequencing analysis of histone H3K27 methylation and acetylation showed a strong overlap between H3K27-acetylated marks and DDIT3 binding. These results support a role for DDIT3 as a transcriptional regulator of H3K27ac-marked genes in transcriptionally active chromatin.

Abstract: Objectives
To assess the prognostic value of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), at diagnosis and during follow-up, of patients with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma treated at the Hematology Service of the Santa Casa de São Paulo Hospital, and to correlate serum CRP levels with disease stage and treatment response.
Methods
A retrospective study involving review of 71 medical records of patients diagnosed with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma between February 2012 and January 2016 was performed. Three patients were subsequently excluded, giving a total of 68 patients for analysis. A level of CRP > 1 mg/dl was considered elevated.
Results
Patients were predominantly male (61.8 %) and mean age was 34 years. Fifty-three (78 %) patients had advanced stage and (76.5 %) had B symptoms. Elevated baseline CRP was associated with greater likelihood of B symptoms (p = 0.02) and of advanced stage (p = 0.015). Patients with Low CRP level after 5th and 6th cycles of chemotherapy was associated with complete response (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively). Treatment-refractory patients had greater risk of death (p = 0.002).
Conclusion
CRP is clinically important for follow-up of patients with Hodgkin´s Lymphoma, where high levels were associated with advanced disease and/or presence of B symptoms. CRP level was considered a predictor of treatment response. Persistence of high CRP values during treatment was associated with refractoriness.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has radically changed the observation of cellular diversity. Although annotations of RNA-seq data require preserved properties among cells of an identity, annotations using conventional methods have not been able to capture universal characters of a cell type. Analysis of expression levels cannot be accurately annotated for cells because differences in transcription do not necessarily explain biological characteristics in terms of cellular functions and because the data themselves do not inform about the correct mapping between cell types and genes. Hence, in this study, we developed a new representation of cellular identities that can be compared over different datasets while preserving nontrivial biological semantics. To generalize the notion of cell types, we developed a new framework to manage cellular identities in terms of set theory. We provided further insights into cells by installing mathematical descriptions of cell biology. We also performed experiments that could correspond to practical applications in annotations of RNA-seq data.

Abstract: Summary
Different thermal runaway triggering methods in battery safety accidents can lead to different outcomes. In this study, four testing methods, including side heating, nail penetration, overcharging, and oven heating, are used to trigger two types of batteries (prismatic cells and pouch cells) within a closed bomb. Several safety properties are investigated, including temperature, amount of venting gas and pressure, gas composition, and the mass of the thermal runaway product. Gas chromatography analysis reveals that the main components in the venting gas are CO, CO2, H2, C2H4, and CH4. Among the four tests conducted for both battery types, overcharging is identified as posing the greatest threat to battery safety. The findings from this study can contribute to assessing the risk associated with different triggers for thermal runaway.

Abstract: Radiation therapy induces targeted effects in the cells that are irradiated and also non-targeted effects (i.e. bystander effects) in non-irradiated cells that are close to or at short distance (<∼1 mm) from irradiated cells. Bystander effects are mediated by intercellular communications and may result in cytotoxic and genotoxic modifications. Their occurrence and relative contribution to the irradiation outcome are influenced by several parameters among which the particle linear energy transfer seems to be prominent. Bystander effects were first observed after external radiation therapy, but have been described also following targeted radionuclide therapy. Therefore, we propose a method to investigate their occurrence in experimental conditions where cells are exposed to radiopharmaceuticals. In this approach, clonogenic cell death is the biological endpoint of the bystander effects caused by irradiation with alpha particles (a potent inducer of the bystander response).

Abstract: Summary
Graphite and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have been widely utilized as oil lubricating additives exhibiting superior friction-reducing capability, but there is debate about which one possesses better lubrication performance in the oil environment. Here, we report the nanotribological properties of graphite and MoS2 homojunctions in the oil environment of hexadecane examined by atomic force microscope (AFM) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The friction coefficient of the MoS2 homojunction is 0.003, while the graphite homojunction processes a much better lubrication performance with a lower friction coefficient of 0.001 (67% reduction). There is a confined molecular layer of hexadecane in the contact zone, and the shear occurs at the graphite/hexadecane and MoS2/hexadecane interfaces for graphite and MoS2 homojunctions, respectively. MD simulation demonstrates that the hexadecane molecules are directionally aligned along the zigzag direction of graphite for the corrugated and anisotropic potential energy surface, and this orderly arrangement contributes to the lower energy barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular electron spins are promising candidates as scalable and tunable qubits but often suffer from undesirable decomposition pathways. Furthermore, significant spin-lattice relaxation and nuclear spin-mediated decoherence limit their applications. While advances in the synthesis of new molecular electron spin qubit candidates have led to improved coherence lifetimes, one key question is whether coherence can be maintained under conditions relevant for employment as quantum sensors. Here, we report a luminescent tetrathiafulvalene-based molecular qubit candidate with diradicaloid character centered on a nuclear-spin-free bridging ligand. This unique air- and water-stable scaffold exhibits a long electron spin decoherence time of hundreds of nanoseconds at ambient temperatures and in nuclear-spin-rich protonated solvents. These results distinguish this system as a promising candidate for the development of novel room temperature, solution-phase quantum sensing technologies and suggest that molecular electron spin qubits can be ideal candidates for these applications.

Abstract: Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment in older patients is challenging. The Determination and Management of Risks for Practices and Procedures in the Elderly (DRIPP) is a multidimensional evaluation program that involves patients undergoing oncological treatments.
Objective
We aimed to evaluate the overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients evaluated and those not evaluated by the DRIPP.
Materials and methods
Retrospective cohort study, patients > 65 years with DLBCL were included. They were divided into 3 groups: patients with a diagnosis prior to the DRIPP implementation (pre-DRIPP), patients with the DRIPP (DRIPP) and patients with a diagnosis after the DRIPP implementation, but who did not undergo the evaluation (non-DRIPP).
Results
A total of 125 patients were analyzed. Fourteen (11%) patients in the pre-DRIPP group, 74 (59%) in the DRIPP group, and 37 (30%) in the non-DRIPP group. In 43 (58%) patients of the DRIPP group, some drug dose adjustments were made vs. 19 (15%) in the non-DRIPP (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in terms of discontinuation of treatment or hematological toxicity between groups. The OS and PFS in one year was 64% (95%CI 34–83) and 50% (95%CI 23–72) for the pre-DRIPP group, 82% (95%CI 71–89) and 72% (95%CI 60–81) for the DRIPP group, 58% (95% CI 41–72) and 56% (95% CI 38–70) for the non-DRIPP group, (p = 0.08). The analysis was adjusted for probable confounders and no differences were found.
Conclusions
This is the first study to evaluate the DRIPP as a decision-making tool in patients with lymphoma and showed a trend towards improvement in the OS in evaluated patients.

Abstract: Summary
The interface between solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) and Li metal poses a significant challenge in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Coating a metal layer on SSEs has been recognized as an effective method for optimizing the SSE/Li interface. However, a comprehensive understanding of how metal layers influence Li deposition behavior remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the In layer exhibits a superior effect in optimizing the interface compared to other metal layers (Cu, Mg, Zn, Sn, Pt, Au). Long-term cycling of Li symmetric cells based on both organic PEO and inorganic antiperovskite Li2OHBr SSEs with an In layer reveals the spherical Li deposition, primarily attributed to the in situ formation of a Li-In alloy at the SSE/Li interface. Moreover, stable cycling performance is demonstrated in LiFePO4 | Li ASSBs employing SSEs modified with an In layer. This work not only provides insights into the Li deposition behavior induced by the In layer on SSEs but also offers valuable guidance for future interface design in ASSBs.

Abstract: Summary
The detection speed of a memristor-based gas sensor (gasistor) is limited because it detects gas passing through the top electrode (TE). In this work, to enhance the response characteristics to nitric oxide (NO) for a hafnium dioxide (HfO2)-based gasistor, we propose the use of a porous carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode and N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (en-APTAS) familiar with NO. First, the CNT as a TE provides approximately five times more sensitivity to 50-ppm NO than that with the conventional metal-TE. Also, when employing the en-APTAS of 1.5 wt % to further enhance the response/response time to NO, we observe a 2-fold higher response under 50-ppm NO at room temperature (RT), as well as a 134-s faster response time with en-APTAS due to the increased adsorption energy of the electrode. These results indicate that the use of both porous TE and an en-APTAS membrane with high adsorption energies can effectively improve the NO-sensing characteristics of the gasistor.

Abstract: Introduction
High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is an essential part of chemotherapy regimens for hematologic neoplasms. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after HDMTX in unmonitored outpatient infusion had not been reported in adults yet. In this study, we evaluated toxicity data after outpatient administration of HDMTX without drug monitoring.
Methods
Patients 16 years old or over with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received at least one outpatient infusion of HDMTX without drug level monitoring were included. This is a retrospective, nested case-control study, in which the cases comprised patients who developed AKI after HDMTX.
Results
Overall, 302 patients were included, encompassing 840 infusions. Hospitalization occurred in 8.6 %. A total of 25 patients presented AKI after HDMTX administration, corresponding to 3 % of the methotrexate (MTX) infusions and 8.3 % of the patients. HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma was more common in patients who presented AKI (18 vs. 6.8 %, p = 0.03). Baseline factors related to AKI after HDMTX were age > 44 y, body surface area ≥ 1.76 m2, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23.8 kg/m2, glomerular filtration rate, and thrombocytopenia (< 150×109/L). Multivariable analysis for adjusting such factors found that BMI was independently related to AKI after HDMTX (OR 3.8). Death after AKI occurred in 56 %.
Conclusion
Our data showed a similar rate of AKI after HDMTX to that reported in the literature, even without drug monitoring. However, patients who developed AKI in our cohort fared worse than expected, with more hospitalizations and death. A higher BMI was associated with the MTX-induced AKI in our cohort, suggesting a differential drug clearance and the need for specific guidelines for obese patients.

Abstract: The genomes of immortalized cell lines (and cancer cells) are characterized by multiple types of aberrations, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to structural rearrangements that have accumulated over time. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the relative impact of different aberrations, the order of events, and which gene functions were under selective pressure at the early stage towards cellular immortalization. Here, we have established novel cell cultures derived from Drosophila melanogaster embryos that were sampled at multiple time points over a one-year period. Using short-read DNA sequencing, we show that copy-number gain in preferentially stress-related genes were acquired in a dominant fraction of cells in 300-days old cultures. Furthermore, transposable elements were active in cells of all cultures. Only a few (<1%) SNPs could be followed over time, and these showed no trend to increase or decrease. We conclude that the early cellular responses of a novel culture comprise sequence duplication and transposable element activity. During immortalization, positive selection first occurs on genes that are related to stress response before shifting to genes that are related to growth.

Abstract: Background
Diabetes cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the major risk factors for the heart failure of the diabetic patients. RIPK1 maybe participate in the regulation of the oxidative stress and inflammation during DCM.
Methods
H&E and Masson staining were utilized to assess the inflammation and fibrosis in myocardial tissues. CCK-8 and TUNEL staining were utilized to analyze cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. SOD activity and MDA content were detected utilizing the kits. The formation of autophagosomes was measured by immunofluorescence assay.
Results
RIPK1 and RPTOR (a component of mTORC1) expression and oxidative stress level were upregulated, but autophagy was decreased in the myocardial tissues of DCM rat characterized by the high body weight and blood glucose, abnormal cardiac function, myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. High glucose (HG) treatment resulted in cell viability and autophagy level decreasing, inflammatory cytokines expression increasing and oxidative stress increasing in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Meanwhile, RIPK1 and RPTOR expression also was increased in HG-treated cells. HG-induced CFs apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and the inhibition of HG to cell viability and autophagy was partly reversed by the inhibitor of RIPK1 and mTORC1.
Conclusion
Overall, RIPK1/mTORC1 signalling suppression improved HG-induced apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress through activation autophagy. These data provided a reliable evidence that RIPK1 may be a potential target for DCM therapeutic.

Abstract: Summary
Transparent solar cells (TSCs) can be used in systems where conventional opaque solar cells cannot be applied, such as in the glass windows of buildings and sunroofs of vehicles. Although extensive research is being conducted on the development of TSCs, some critical limitations remain, including low power conversion efficiency (PCE), reduction in PCE with changes in the angle of incidence of light, and temperature increase in the TSC. In this study, we address these critical issues by selectively applying microscale inverted-pyramidal-structured polydimethylsiloxane to the TSC. As a result, we develop crystalline silicon-based glass-like TSCs with a PCE of 15.8% (at an average visible transmittance of 20%). Furthermore, due to the wide-angle anti-reflection effects, this system maintains a PCE retention of 96% even at an incident angle of 50°, and the film demonstrates a radiative cooling effect that can reduce temperatures of the TSC by up to 16°C.

Abstract: Summary
Passive solar desalination is an emerging low-cost technology for freshwater production. State-of-the-art desalinators typically evaporate water using wicking structures to achieve high solar-to-vapor efficiency. However, wicking structures have limited salt rejection capability, which typically limits the operating duration to several hours. In addition, few studies have demonstrated efficient condensation to achieve a high solar-to-water efficiency. Here, we report a passive inverted single-stage solar desalinator that achieves continuous desalination and efficient condensation by convection-mediated salt diffusion and a novel mode of thin-film condensation. We experimentally demonstrate a record-high continuous passive desalination and salt rejection test duration of 168 h (7 days) under one-sun illumination. Our desalinator achieves a water collection rate of 0.5 kg m−2 h−1, which corresponds to a 32.9% solar-to-water efficiency. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical transport model and perform a parametric study to guide further optimization. This work signifies an improvement in the robustness of current state-of-the-art desalinators.

Abstract: Summary
Structural information in a disordered atomic system cannot be acquired from everyday X-ray diffractometers, so we have to resort to synchrotron resources. The pair distribution function from synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering reflects the local bond information regardless of the crystallinity, but the limited access to these high-energy light resources prevents them from widespread use. Here, we develop a microstructure analysis framework to study immiscible binary alloys through the integration of local elemental segregation analysis, electron-based pair distribution function, the corresponding wavelet coherence spectrum, and ab initio level simulation. All the information can be obtained from an in-house transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscope. A series of nanoparticles based on immiscible Pd-Ru alloys are chosen as model catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the structure-performance relationship is established on the basis of the electrochemical tests and structural information from the analysis toolkit we developed.

Abstract: Summary
The replacement of synthetic plastics with biodegradable alternatives made from abundant and sustainable raw materials is a challenge of high societal importance. We report a class of high-performance multifunctional composite films made of nano- and microscale reinforced naturally sourced biopolymers. These films are made of an agarose matrix reinforced with hierarchically branched soft dendritic colloids (SDCs) from chitosan. Owing to the highly entangled hierarchical network of the SDC nanofibrils, the reinforced composite has excellent performance with more than 4× higher toughness than non-reinforced agarose, high visible light transmittance, improved hydrostability, and remarkable bactericidal activity. Thus, these reinforced biopolymer composites could match or exceed the excellent mechanical, barrier, and optical properties of common synthetic polymer films. We also demonstrate the soil biodegradability of this composite material in a controlled environment. The results suggest a universal strategy for manufacturing natural-source composite materials that could serve as substitutes for petroleum-based plastics.

Abstract: The response to radiation therapy incorporates both the direct impacts of radiation on cancer cells as well as the immune consequences that can help or hinder control of residual disease. Understanding the response of an individual patient’s cancer to radiation, and the impact of radiation on the immune cell subsets present in the tumor prior to radiation therapy, can help identify potential predictors of outcome. Here, we describe a methodological approach to using an explant tumor model to characterize and study the immune cell subsets in murine tumors following exposure to ex vivo radiation treatment. The broader tumor environment incorporates distinct microenvironments consisting of tumor stroma and cancer cell nests, with limited interchange between these zones. Ex vivo analysis of tumor explants ensures that these environments remain intact and allows patient-specific response assessments with a broader range of treatment conditions to find optimal conditions and immunotherapy combinations. While this protocol describes the treatment of murine tumors, with minor variations the same protocol can be used to study and characterize various immune populations following radiation therapy in human tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate and reliable estimation of battery health is crucial for predictive health management. We report a strategy to strengthen the accuracy and generalization of battery health estimation. The model can be initially built based on one battery and then continuously updated using unlabeled data and sparse limited labeled data collected in early stages of testing batteries in different scenarios, satisfying incremental improvement in practical applications. We generate our datasets from 55 commercial pouch and prismatic batteries aged for more than 116,000 cycles under various scenarios. Our model achieves a root mean-square error of 1.312% for the estimation of different dynamic current modes and rates and variable temperature conditions over the entire lifespan using partial charging data. Our model is interpreted by the post hoc strategy with unbiased hidden features, prevents catastrophic forgetting, and supports estimation using data collected in 3 min during ultra-fast charging with errors of less than 2.8%.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism by which morphogenetic signals engage the regulatory networks responsible for early embryonic tissue patterning is incompletely understood. Here, we developed a minimal gene regulatory network (GRN) model of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lineage commitment and embedded it into “cellular” agents that respond to a dynamic morphogenetic signaling microenvironment. Simulations demonstrated that GRN wiring had significant non-intuitive effects on tissue pattern order, composition, and dynamics. Experimental perturbation of GRN connectivities supported model predictions and demonstrated the role of OCT4 as a master regulator of peri-gastrulation fates. Our so-called GARMEN strategy provides a multiscale computational platform to understand how single-cell-based regulatory interactions scale to tissue domains. This foundation provides new opportunities to simulate the impact of network motifs on normal and aberrant tissue development.

Abstract: Summary
The storage of COVID-19 vaccines at low temperatures leads to the rising demand of ultra-low-temperature (ULT; between −40°C and −86°C) freezers. Current commercial ULT freezers are usually of large capacity and high cost and thus can be prohibitive for personal use. Cheaper, smaller-size ULT freezers would effectively address the needs of most point-of-use cold storage. Current portable freezers are mainly powered by thermoelectric modules. However, they require five or six stages to cool from room temperature to −70°C with their low cooling capacity. In this work, we develop a small-size, low-cost, two-stage thermoelectric freezer in combination with a conventional compressor-based household freezer to reach −70°C. Our design combines the high coefficient of performance provided by a vapor compressor and the accurate temperature control of Peltier coolers. The demonstrated hybrid ULT freezer could facilitate the transportation and storage of clinical products around the world and make vaccines more accessible to people in remote areas.

Abstract: Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is characterized by heterogeneous biology and clinical behavior. Immunophenotypic characteristics include the expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers (e.g. CD41, CD42a, CD42b, CD61) associated with immaturity markers (CD34, CD117, HLA-DR) and myeloid markers (e.g. CD13, CD33) and even with lymphoid cross-lineage markers (e.g. CD7, CD56). Although the diagnostic immunophenotype has already been well described, given the rarity of the disease, its immunophenotypic heterogeneity and post-therapeutic instability, there is no consensus on the combination of monoclonal markers to detect minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD). Currently, MRD is an important tool for assessing treatment efficacy and prognostic risk. In this study, we evaluated the immunophenotypic profile of MRD in a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, to identify which markers, positive or negative, were more stable after treatment and which could be useful for MRD evaluation. The expression profile of each marker was evaluated in sequential MRD samples. In conclusion, the markers evaluated in this study can be combined in an MRD immunophenotypic panel to investigate for megakaryoblastic leukemia. Although this study is retrospective and some data are missing, the information obtained may contribute to prospective studies to validate more specific strategies in the detection of MRD in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Abstract: Mitophagy is a finely regulated mechanism through which eukaryotic cells selectively dispose of supernumerary, permeabilized or otherwise damaged mitochondria through lysosomal degradation. Dysfunctional mitochondria are prone to release potentially cytotoxic factors including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activators, such as cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS). Thus, proficient mitophagic responses mediate prominent cytoprotective functions. Moreover, the rapid degradation of permeabilized mitochondria limits the release of mitochondrial components that may drive inflammatory reactions, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), implying that mitophagy also mediates potent anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we detail a simple, flow cytometry-assisted protocol for the specific measurement of mitophagic responses as driven by radiation therapy (RT) in mouse hormone receptor (HR)+ mammary carcinoma TS/A cells. With some variations, this method – which relies on the mitochondria-restricted expression of a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive to pH and hence changes excitation wavelength within lysosomes (mt-mKeima) – can be adapted to a variety of human and mouse cancer cell lines and/or straightforwardly implemented on fluorescence microscopy platforms.

Abstract: Summary
Electrochemically converting CO2 to renewable synthons is steadily becoming a globally scalable and important CO2 utilization technology. Nevertheless, most industrial endeavors employ catalysts based on metallic Ag or Au, with few catalytically competitive alternatives, showing similar activity, high mass activity, and cost efficiency. Similarly, this effort is hindered by insufficient testing of promising materials in application-oriented conditions. We herein present a holistic pathway starting from the conceptualization of different Ag(I)-based molecular catalysts to their complete integration into directly industrially applicable cell assemblies. Notably, optimization of not only the catalyst but also the operational conditions allowed us to achieve CO2 electrolysis for at least 110 h at 300 mA cm−2 and 80 h at 600 mA cm−2 with an FECO decay rate of 0.01% h−1. Beyond significant mass activity improvements for CO production, we provide the community with a broad toolbox toward improving catalytic and cell performance directly between different cell sizes.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemoglobinopathy Sβ-thalassemia (HbSβ-thal) has a wide range of clinical and laboratory severity. There is limited information on the natural history of HbSβ-thal and its modulating factors. We described the molecular, hematological, and clinical characteristics of a cohort of children with HbSβ-thal and estimated its incidence in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
Methods
Laboratory and clinical data were retrieved from medical records. Molecular analysis was performed by HBB gene sequencing, PCR-RFLP, gap-PCR, and MLPA.
Results
Eighty-nine children were included in the study. Fourteen alleles of β-thal mutations were identified. The incidence of HbSβ-thal in the state was 1 per 22,250 newborns. The most common βS-haplotypes were CAR and Benin. The most frequent βthal-haplotypes were V, II, and I. Coexistence of 3.7 kb HBA1/HBA2 deletion was present in 21.3 % of children. β-thalassemia mutations were associated with several clinical and laboratory features. In general, the incidence of clinical events per 100 patient-years was similar for children with HbSβ0-thal, IVS-I-5 G>A, and IVS-I-110 G>A. Children with HbSβ+-intermediate phenotypes had a more severe laboratory and clinical profile when compared with those with HbSβ+-mild ones. βS-haplotypes and α-thalassemia did not meaningfully influence the phenotype of children with HbSβ-thal.
Conclusion
The early identification of β-thalassemia alleles may help the clinical management of these children.

Abstract: CD276 has been studied in a variety of cancers and diseases, but its regulatory mechanisms in gastric cancer is still unclear. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one of the important members of tumor microenvironment, play an important role in the occurrence, development and metastasis of tumor, but the relationship between gastric cancer mesenchymal stem cells (GCMSCs) and CD276 in gastric cancer needs to be further explored. The differential expression of CD276 was identified via UCLAN and GEPIA databases. Then, the impacts of CD276 were calculated on clinical prognosis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter and Cox analysis. GO, KEGG and GSEA analysis were used to explore potential mechanism under CD276. Next, the expression of CD276 in gastric cell lines were detected by Western blot. Immunocoprecipitation was used to explore the association between CD276 and COL1A1. And the effect of condition medium (CM) from GCMSCs on gastric cell lines migration analyzed. GC-MSCs activated the AKT/c-Myc/mTOR pathway of gastric cell lines and upregulated CD276 expression. Moreover, the upregulation of CD276 promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells. Taken together, this study shown that GCMSCs could up-regulate the expression of CD276 of gastric cell lines to promote tumor migration. Our results provide a new basis for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Many myofibrillar proteins undergo isoform switching in a spatio-temporal manner during muscle development. The biological significance of the variants of several of these myofibrillar proteins remains elusive. One such myofibrillar protein, the Muscle LIM Protein (MLP), is a vital component of the Z-discs. In this paper, we show that one of the Drosophila MLP encoding genes, Mlp60A, gives rise to two isoforms: a short (279 bp, 10 kDa) and a long (1461 bp, 54 kDa) one. The short isoform is expressed throughout development, but the long isoform is adult-specific, being the dominant of the two isoforms in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs). A concomitant, muscle-specific knockdown of both isoforms leads to partial developmental lethality, with most of the surviving flies being flight defective. A global loss of both isoforms in a Mlp60A-null background also leads to developmental lethality, with muscle defects in the individuals that survive to the third instar larval stage. This lethality could be rescued partially by a muscle-specific overexpression of the short isoform. Genetic perturbation of only the long isoform, through a P-element insertion in the long isoform-specific coding sequence, leads to defective flight, in around 90% of the flies. This phenotype was completely rescued when the P-element insertion was precisely excised from the locus. Hence, our data show that the two Mlp60A isoforms are functionally specialized: the short isoform being essential for normal embryonic muscle development and the long isoform being necessary for normal adult flight muscle function.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles are small particles involved in intercellular signaling. They are produced by virtually all cell types, transport biological molecules, and are released into the extracellular space. Studies on extracellular vesicles have become more numerous in recent years, leading to promising research on their potential impact on health and disease. Despite significant progress in understanding the bioactivity of extracellular vesicles, most in vitro and in vivo studies overlook their transport through the extracellular matrix in tissues. The interaction or free diffusion of extracellular vesicles in their environment can provide valuable insights into their efficacy and function. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the transport of extracellular vesicles in the extracellular matrix is essential for the development of new therapeutic approaches that involve the use of these extracellular vesicles. This review discusses the importance of the interaction between extracellular vesicles and the extracellular matrix and the different factors that influence their diffusion. In addition, we evaluate their role in tissue homeostasis, pathophysiology, and potential clinical applications. Understanding the complex interaction between extracellular vesicles and the extracellular matrix is critical in order to develop effective strategies to target specific cells and tissues in a wide range of clinical applications.

Abstract: The limited cardiomyocyte proliferation is insufficient for repair of the myocardium. Therefore, activating cardiomyocyte proliferation might be a reasonable option for myocardial regeneration. Here, we investigated effect of retinoic acid (RA) on inducing adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and assessed efficacy of self-assembling peptide (SAP)-released RA in activating regeneration of the infarcted myocardium. Effect of RA on inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation was examined with the isolated cardiomyocytes. Expression of the cell cycle-associated genes and paracrine factors in the infarcted myocardium was examined at one week after treatment with SAP-carried RA. Cardiomyocyte proliferation, myocardial regeneration and improvement of cardiac function were assessed at four weeks after treatment. In the adult rat myocardium, expression of RA synthetase gene Raldh2 and RA concentration were decreased significantly. After treatment with RA, the proliferated cardiomyocytes were increased. The formulated SAP could sustainedly release RA. After treatment with SAP-carried RA, expression of the pro-proliferative genes in cell cycle and paracrine factors in the infarcted myocardium were up-regulated. Myocardial regeneration was enhanced, and cardiac function was improved significantly. These results demonstrate that RA can induce adult cardiomyocytes to proliferate effectively. The sustained release of RA with SAP is a promise strategy to enhance repair of the infarcted myocardium.

Abstract: Introduction
The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a significant role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) genesis and there is evidence that BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) can support leukemia progenitor cell proliferation and survival and provide resistance to cytotoxic therapies.
Hypothesis and method
Nevertheless, currently unknown are the relevance of the spatial localization of AML cells relative to the BMMSCs and whether BMMSCs from patients with AML and healthy subjects have similar properties. To address these issues, we performed a differential gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing data generated from healthy donors (HDs) and leukemic BMMSCs.
Results
The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that leukemic BMMSCs were associated with the terms “positive regulation of cell cycle”, “angiogenesis” and “signaling by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)”, whereas healthy donor (HD)-derived BMMSCs were associated with “programmed cell death in response to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)”, “negative regulation of the cytochrome C from the mitochondria” and “interferon signaling”. Next, we evaluated the mitochondrial superoxide production in AML cells in a co-culture layered model. The superoxide production was reduced in leukemic cells in close contact (adhered to the surface or beneath the cell layer) with BMMSCs, indicating lower oxidative stress.
Conclusion
Taken together, our results suggest that AML-derived BMMSCs are transcriptionally rewired and can reduce the metabolic stress of leukemic cells.

Abstract: Adequate proliferation and migration of placental trophoblasts is the prerequisite of a successful pregnancy. Peroxiredoxin2 (Prdx2) is a multi-functional gene involved in various signal events to maintain essential biological functions and normal cellular homeostasis. In this study, substantially lower Prdx2 levels were found in the first trimester cytotrophoblasts of women who suffered from recurrent miscarriage (RM). Prdx2 downregulation inhibited trophoblast proliferation and migration. We demonstrated that histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) acts downstream of Prdx2 in regulating trophoblast proliferation and migration. HDAC2 deacetylates histone-3-lysine-9 in E-cadherin (E-cad) promoter and reduces the transcription of E-cad epigenetically, whereas it promotes the expression of Slug and Snail genes. These molecular changes may contribute to the trophoblast epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We further verified whether Prdx2 modulated the expression of HDAC2 through SPIB. SPIB could bind to the HDAC2 promoter PU-box region and induce HDAC2 expression. In RM, down-regulated Prdx2 suppresses SPIB-HDAC2 pathway, leading to increased E-cad and decreased Slug and Snail, and eventually restrains trophoblast proliferation and migration. Our study unveils the role of Prdx2-regulated SPIB-HDAC2 pathway in the pathology of RM and provides diagnostic and therapeutic targets for RM as well as other “great obstetrical syndromes” including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Ceria is important for catalysis due to its ability to form and utilize oxygen vacancies during redox reactions. Understanding the dynamic formation of the oxygen vacancies has contributed to the development of efficient catalytic processes. Here, we demonstrate the presence of oxygen vacancy clusters in the bulk of ceria and gold/ceria catalysts upon anaerobic carbon monoxide oxidation and describe their interplay with the orbital hybridization of Ce3+ 4f and 5d states. Observations are made using in situ X-ray Raman scattering spectroscopy at O K- and Ce N4,5-edges and in situ X-ray diffraction. These, combined with multiplet calculations, allow detection of the formation of Ce3+ in gold/ceria upon low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation. The modifications observed at the O K-edge reflect the rearrangement of the bulk oxygen sublattice. Density-functional theory calculations show vacancy ordering in the bulk, and explain modifications at the O K-edge, involving the hybridization of the Ce 4f and 5d and O 2p orbitals.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial management of functional microbial subpopulations is of importance for achieving efficient nutrient removal in wastewater treatment. Inspired by the construction of synthetic microbiota, a membrane-based microbial incubator (MMIR) is developed for in situ enrichment of targeted consortia. The MMIR can help to achieve satisfactory nitrogen removal during a pilot-scale anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic process. A 16S rRNA analysis suggests that the efficient denitrification is attributed to the enrichment of small genome-sized denitrifiers in MMIR (e.g., Sulfurimonas, Sulfurospirillum, and Sulfurovum), with a total abundance of 42.12%. In comparison, such denitrifiers are of much lower abundances in the sludge flocs (<0.78%). Metagenome analysis further suggests that the enriched denitrifying consortia contain more abundant genes (fold changes >2), contributing to nitrate reduction and carbon utilization. This study provides us with a new method to regulate the denitrifying consortia and optimize the carbon source supplementation, contributing to the improvement of bioreactor performance in wastewater treatment plants.

Abstract: Summary
Quantum coherence plays a crucial role in manipulating and controlling quantum systems, leading to breakthroughs in various fields such as quantum information, quantum sensing, and the detection of gravitational waves. Most coherence witnesses rely on the assumption of being able to control quantum states. Here, we report a device-independent coherence model by extending the standard Bell theory to multiple source scenarios. We propose a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type paradox to verify the particle and wave behaviors of a coherent carrier. We experimentally generate generalized two-photon entangled states that violate the present paradox, witnessing spatial quantum superposition through local measurements.

Abstract: Summary
Sound waves carry abundant physical information essential for environmental perception. Traditional sensor-array-based sound-source localization methods suffer from drawbacks such as large system size and complex data processing. Existing compressive-sensing imaging methods can realize sound identification, but the reliance on highly anisotropic metamaterials makes it difficult for them to achieve high-precision sound-source localization with relatively regular low-loss devices. Inspired by the Nautilus structure, we propose a bionic metamaterial multi-information fusion compressed-sensing acoustic imaging device for sound localization and identification. By imitating the spiral geometry of the Nautilus, the regular metamaterial design strategy reduces the structural complexity and the sound loss. We introduce a multi-information fusion method to decrease anisotropic reliance and enhance compressed-sensing acoustic imaging capabilities. The proposed positioning device can identify multiple broadband sound sources with a high identification success rate even in noisy environments, which shows wide application prospects in medical inspection and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Microglia cells dynamically survey the central nervous system microenvironment and, in response to tissue damage inflicted by radiation therapy, disease or infection, undergo morphological and functional changes that culminate in microglia activation. Cell shape transformation can be assessed descriptively or, alternatively, it can be quantified as a continuous variable for parameters including total cell size as well as protrusion length, ramification and complexity. The purpose of the MorphoMacro method is to quantitatively profile multiple and single microglia cells using the available ImageJ platform. This method outlines the required steps and ImageJ plugins to convert fluorescence and bright-field photomicrographs into representative binary and skeletonized images and to analyze them using the MorphoMacro software plugin for multiparametric and multilevel description of microglia cell morphology in vivo and ex vivo. Overall, the protocol provides a quantitative and comprehensive tool that can be used to identify, stratify, and monitor diverse microglia morphologies in homeostatic, different disease conditions and subsequent therapeutic monitoring.

Abstract: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired bleeding disorder observed in the clinical practice. Little is known about its epidemiology in Brazil. The present study was conducted at a hematology referral center which covers a population of over 8 million in 184 municipalities in the state of Ceará. The purpose of this study was to draw a demographic profile of adult ITP patients with regard to sex, age, geographical origin and distribution across the state, and the proportion of secondary ITP. Following ethics committee approval, information was collected with an ad hoc instrument. The sample consisted of 187 adult ITP patients attending the Walter Cantídio University Hospital in 2015. The median follow-up time was 67 months (range: 1 month to 29 years). Female sex (n = 154; 82.35 %) was strongly prevalent in all age brackets, with an overall female/male ratio of 4.7:1. The median age was 41 ± 16.1 with an interquartile range of 29–55.5 years; there was no difference between the genders. Secondary ITP (18/187; 9.6 %) displayed a bimodal distribution and a linear increase between 38 and >68 years of age. The results of this survey on the epidemiology of ITP in Brazil suggest that ethnic and geographical factors may have a great impact on age and sex distribution and on the distribution of secondary ITP.

Abstract: Background
Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is a type I arginine methyltransferase that asymmetrically dimethylates histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2a). However, the biological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of PRMT6 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear.
Methods
PRMT6 expression in CRC tissue was examined using immunohistochemistry. The effect of PRMT6 on CRC cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays were performed to identify interaction partners of PRMT6. RNA-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were used to investigate the mechanism of PRMT6 in gene regulation.
Results
PRMT6 is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and facilitates cell proliferation of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Through RNA-seq analysis, CDKN2B (p15INK4b) and CCNG1 were identified as new transcriptional targets of PRMT6. PRMT6-dependent H3R2me2a mark was predominantly deposited at the promoters of CDKN2B and CCNG1 in CRC cells. Furthermore, PRMT5 was firstly characterized as an interaction partner of PRMT6. Notably, H3R2me2a coincides with PRMT5-mediated H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s marks at the promoters of CDKN2B and CCNG1 genes, thus leading to transcriptional repression of these genes.
Conclusions
PRMT6 functionally associates with PRMT5 to promote CRC progression through epigenetically repressing the expression of CDKN2B and CCNG1. These insights raise the possibility that combinational intervention of PRMT6 and PRMT5 may be a promising strategy for CRC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Iron-based selenides are considered one of the most promising candidates for anode materials in potassium-ion batteries due to their impressive theoretical capacities. However, the challenges of enormous volume expansion and low intrinsic conductivity result in suboptimal electrochemical performance. Here, an iron selenide (Fe7Se8) with a yolk-shell structure (Fe7Se8/C@NC) is designed that effectively improves structural stability, relieves volume expansion, enhances ionic conductivity via carbon-shell construction, and prevents architecture damage caused by Fe7Se8 aggregation. Because of these advantages, the electrode presents a satisfactory cycling stability (206.6 mAh g−1 after 3,200 cycles at 1 A g−1) and an excellent rate capacity (205.2 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1). In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy characterizations elucidate the potassium storage mechanism of Fe7Se8. The electrochemical performance of the composites positions them as promising electrode materials.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the effect of PF in regulating the progression of T1D through regulating gut microbiota and inhibiting TLR4-myD88/TRIF pathway. T1D mouse models were established and received PF treatment through intraperitoneal injection. The glucose, sugar tolerance, the incidence of T1D and H&E staining were detected to verify the effect of PF on T1D. Meanwhile, the changes of gut microbiota and the permeability of intestines in mice were also measured. On parallel, the number and function of immune cells were detected by Flow Cytometry. The expressions of ZO-1, ZO-2 and TLR4-myD88/TRIF pathway related proteins were detected by western blotting. Mice received PF treatment had decreased incidence of T1D and inflammatory infiltration in islet tissues compared with those received PBS treatment. In addition to that, PF treated mice had increased Sutterella species and decreased intestinal permeability, in which the decreased ratio of Th1/Th17 and increased Treg cells were also identified. The expression of TLR4-myD88/TRIF pathway was also suppressed in response to PF treatment. Moreover, further treatment with TLR4 agonist, LPS, could reverse the effect of PF on T1D mice. PF can suppress the TLR4 mediated myD88/TRIF pathway to change the distribution of gut microbiota, so as to protect NOD mice from T1D.

Abstract: Summary
Deuterium labeling of organic molecules with high efficiency is a promising and challenging task in organic synthesis and drug discovery. Here we report two practical and robust strategies based on zinc-mediated one-pot reductive coupling of alkyl halides and (deuterated) alcohols utilizing ArSO2SNa as crucial sulfur shuttle in absence of thiols. The approaches feature nickel and base-free conditions, broad substrate scope, and late-stage molecule modification, providing a wide range of trideuteromethyl alkyl sulfides and other important analogs with the examples of sulfoxide, sulfone, and sulfoximine. Initial mechanistic studies show that an active adduct of Zn into thiosulfonates is formed in nearly quantitative yield, and it could be further applied to the nucleophilic substitution of alkyl electrophiles to construct a variety of Csp3–S bonds.

Abstract: The reduction of insulin secretion due to pancreatic β cell injury caused by autoimmune reaction is the pathological basis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Therefore, seeking new molecular targets for alleviating pancreatic β cell injury will provide experimental basis for the prevention and treatment of T1DM. SRY-box 9 (Sox9) is not only an important molecule regulating the development of various organs, but also its high expression can aggravate the pathological process of various diseases. In addition, Sox9+ cells are also pancreatic progenitor cells, participating in pancreatic repair reaction induced by injury. In our study, elevated blood glucose and lack of pancreatic β cells almost returned to normal over time after streptozotocin (STZ)-induced pancreatic β cell damage, implying that pancreatic β cells were regenerated after STZ-induced injury. In particular, the expression of Sox9 was significantly elevated during pancreatic β cell regeneration. On this basis, we conducted in vitro experiments to verify whether overexpression of Sox9 could inhibit the damage of pancreatic β cells by inflammatory factors. Our results showed that overexpression of Sox9 alleviated the damage of pancreatic β cells by inflammatory factors and improved the inhibitory effect of inflammatory factors on insulin secretion of pancreatic β cells. Unsurprising, blood glucose levels, insulin content and pancreatic β cell number failed to return to near-normal levels timely after pancreatic β cells specific knockout Sox9 mice were treated with STZ, further confirming the importance of Sox9 in facilitating pancreatic β cell repair or regeneration. Our study indicate that enhanced Sox9 activity might protect pancreatic β cells from autoimmune induced damage and thus improve the pathological process of T1DM.

Abstract: Protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases that control cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Aberrant PKCε activation and overexpression is a frequent feature of numerous cancers. However, its role in regulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells remains elusive. Here we report a novel function of PKCε in regulating of prostate cancer cell proliferation by modulation of PKM2-mediated de novo lipogenesis. We show that PKCε promotes de novo lipogenesis and tumor cell proliferation via upregulation of lipogenic enzymes and lipid contents in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, PKCε interacts with NABD (1–388) domain of C-terminal deletion on pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) and enhances the Tyr105 phosphorylation of PKM2, leading to its nuclear localization. Moreover, forced expression of mutant Tyr105 (Y105F) or PKM2 inhibition suppressed de novo lipogenesis and cell proliferation induced by overexpression of PKCε in prostate cancer cells. In a murine tumor model, inhibitor of PKM2 antagonizes lipogenic enzymes expression and prostate cancer growth induced by overexpression of PKCε in vivo. These data indicate that PKCε is a critical regulator of de novo lipogenesis, which may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) offer improved energy efficiency in aerospace and automobile applications due to lightweight and mechanical robustness but face challenges with limited recyclability and frequent fiber-polymer delamination caused by inadequate interfacial adhesion. Here, we report an effective design of tough and closed-loop recyclable carbon-fiber-reinforced vitrimers (CFRVs) with exceptional interfacial adhesion through the synergy of a boronic ester-modified commodity polymer, multidiol cross-linker, and diol-functionalized carbon fibers (CFs). The dynamic covalent bonding between the vitrimer and fiber interface results in 43% higher interfacial adhesion than that of CFRVs with pristine CFs. Moreover, CFRVs with diol-CFs exhibit ∼731-MPa tensile strength, 26% higher than unmodified CFRVs and 49% higher than conventional epoxy CFRPs. Importantly, the dynamic boronic ester exchange enables CFRV closed-loop recyclability, repairability, fast thermoformability, self-adhesion, and multicycle processability without compromising mechanical performance. The designed dynamic fiber-matrix interaction will open up a new paradigm of multifunctional CFRPs while providing a path toward closed-loop structural materials.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-ion-containing soft materials include metallogels, metal-organic frameworks, and coordination polymers. These materials show commercial value in catalysis, hydrogen storage, and electronics. Metal-containing soft materials reported to date are structurally weak, falling short of a Young’s modulus typical of engineering-grade materials. We report herein that inclusion of an antisolvent in metal-thiolate metallogel synthesis results in a colloidal sol, where the colloids comprise amorphous metal-organic complexes. Upon desolvation, the colloids coalesce to form a solid phase that is both gel like and glass like. This solid phase is structurally amorphous, comprises continuous networks similar to organic polymers, and has stiffness observed in polymeric materials with extended structure, yet contains a superstoichiometric amount of metal relative to organic ligand. The solid phase is therefore a rigid, amorphous metal-rich (RAMETRIC) material. Highlighting the rigidity, the Young’s modulus of the gel-phase material is 1,000× greater than metallogels comprised of the same constituent building blocks.

Abstract: Summary
Soft actuators offer several advantages over traditional rigid machines. Among soft materials, liquid metal (LM) is particularly noteworthy for its electro-responsive surface properties that induce flow or morphological changes, making it ideal for soft machines. Although using LM droplets as micropumps is simple, they face challenges in efficient vertical fluid pumping. Here, we report a pump-valve dual-functional LM soft actuator (PDLMA) that can continuously pump liquid upward. Benefiting from the unique conformability of LM, the PDLMA can provide the function of a check valve, which blocks the backflow of the rising liquid while continuing the pumping effect. At 6 V direct current (DC), the PDLMA lifts the solution more than 80 cm. We demonstrate the device’s applications in circuit-on/off switches and pump-mixer systems. Moreover, as a conceptual experiment, we show the PDLMA’s ability to achieve contamination-free drug delivery. The PDLMA represents a crucial step toward the development of soft actuators for flexible machines.

Abstract: Summary
High-density plasma sources have shown great application potential in vehicle stealth. However, the atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ), a plasma source with electron density as high as 1019–1020 m−3, has received little attention. In this paper, the plasma characteristics and active stealth effect of arrayed multi-APPJ sources are investigated through joint simulation of an APPJ discharge model and an improved scattering matrix method model. The joint simulation model is verified by terahertz interference experiments. Results under different voltages, needle electrode radii, and arrayed spacing show that the multi-APPJ sources in arrayed mode have lower reflection attenuation (−43.4 dB), more optimal stealth frequency points (3), and wider stealth frequency ranges (1.8–16.9 and 19.6–40 GHz) than an inductively coupled plasma source. The stealth frequency range of multi-APPJ sources in arrayed mode covers all frequency bands commonly used in satellite communications, which shows great application potential in vehicle stealth.

Abstract: Summary
Because of their excellent photostability and brightness, organic fluorophores are becoming increasingly attractive for long-term live-cell superresolution imaging of subcellular structures but often suffer from low cell permeability. Here, we develop a general strategy to deliver cell-impermeable organic fluorescent probes, including various SNAP/Halo tag probes, into live cells with excellent delivery efficiency (up to 97% labeling) and almost 100% endo/lysosomal release by simple coincubation with a novel type of peptide vehicle, mixLPV, a mixture of two cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). Using a mixLPV-mediated labeling system, we obtained multicolor live-cell superresolution images of diverse subcellular structures with high specificity, brightness, and photostability, which allowed us to track their dynamics for up to 1,000 time points and to reveal diverse dynamic interactions between them. Our results not only greatly expand the applications of nanoscopy in various live-cell dynamic studies but also provide a novel concept for the design of CPP-mediated delivery systems.

Abstract: Summary
Plastics are critical in facilitating the comfort and quality of everyday life. Most plastics are discarded after a single use, wasting the energy and carbon consumed for their production and incurring environmental costs. Thus, closed-loop production and recycling processes are needed to mitigate energy and carbon loss toward a net-zero carbon economy. Here, we show that poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) can be efficiently deconstructed into small-molecule α,ω-dialkenenyl terephthalates using organocatalyzed transesterification. The resulting compounds can be polymerized by acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, affording unsaturated semi-aromatic polyesters with thermomechanical properties dependent on the monomer structure and the catalyst used for their synthesis. High-molecular-weight ADMET polymers form free-standing films that are ductile and tough with mechanical properties similar to widely used commodity plastics. Crucially, the ADMET polymers can be deconstructed to monomers using Retro-ADMET and re-polymerized by ADMET polymerization, establishing closed-loop circularity for a unique class of materials.

Abstract: Oxidative stress-induced ferroptosis of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells contributes to retinal degenerative diseases. The antioxidant molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) regulates oxidative stress response, but its effect on the ferroptosis of RPE cells is unclear. In this study, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was used as an exogenous H2S donor to intervene tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced ferroptosis of APRE-19 cells. We found that NaHS pretreatment attenuates t-BHP-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Analysis of mRNA-sequencing coupled with FerrDb database identified nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) as a primary target for the cytoprotective role of H2S. NRF2 inhibitor ML385 reverses the effects of H2S on ferroptosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that H2S stabilizes NRF2. H2S decreases the interaction between NRF2 and KEAP1, but enhances the interaction between KEAP1 and p62. These results suggest that H2S activates the non-canonical NRF2-KEAP1 pathway. Further study demonstrated that H2S stimulates AMPK to interact and phosphorylate p62. Additionally, inhibiting AMPK or knocking down p62 blocks the effects of H2S. We speculate that targeting the non-canonical NRF2-KEAP1 pathway by H2S-based drug may benefit the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.

Abstract: The overexpression of BMI1, a polycomb protein, correlates with cancer development and aggressiveness. We previously reported that MYCN-induced BMI1 positively regulated neuroblastoma (NB) cell proliferation via the transcriptional inhibition of tumor suppressors in NB cells. To assess the potential of BMI1 as a new target for NB therapy, we examined the effects of reductions in BMI1 on NB cells. BMI1 knockdown (KD) in NB cells significantly induced their differentiation for up to 7 days. BMI1 depletion significantly induced apoptotic NB cell death for up to 14 days along with the activation of p53, increases in p73, and induction of p53 family downstream molecules and pathways, even in p53 mutant cells. BMI1 depletion in vivo markedly suppressed NB xenograft tumor growth. BMI1 reductions activated ATM and increased γ-H2AX in NB cells. These DNA damage signals and apoptotic cell death were not canceled by the transduction of the polycomb group molecules EZH2 and RING1B. Furthermore, EZH2 and RING1B KD did not induce apoptotic NB cell death to the same extent as BMI1 KD. Collectively, these results suggest the potential of BMI1 as a target of molecular therapy for NB and confirmed, for the first time, the shared role of PcG proteins in the DNA damage response of NB cells.

Abstract: Summary
Tuning the coordination number and coordinating atoms is a general strategy to control the activity of single-atom catalysts; however, this method has encountered bottlenecks in investigating the atomically dispersed Ni-N-C catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we propose a strategy by modulating a ligand-conjugated structure to improve the activity of Ni-based single-atom catalysts without changing the coordinated atoms and coordination numbers. In the pyrrole-type Ni-N-C catalyst (Ni-NPyrrolic-C), the electron-donating conjugation effect of the pyrrole ligand reduces the electron cloud density on the N atom, resulting in stronger electron depletion around the active center Ni atom and thereby improving activity of CO2 electroreduction to CO. The Ni-NPyrrolic-C possesses a notable CO partial current density of 415 mA cm−2 with 92% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a moderate potential of −0.85 V in gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), which outperforms the pyridinic-type Ni-N-C catalyst (Ni-NPyridinic-C) with electron-withdrawing conjugation effect ligands.

Abstract: Summary
The mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP7 has emerged as a key negative regulator of cytosolic NA-sensors of the innate immune system. We apply a rational design strategy for converting a pan-PARP inhibitor into a potent selective PARP7 inhibitor (KMR-206). Consistent with studies using the structurally distinct PARP7 inhibitor RBN-2397, co-treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with KMR-206 and NA-sensor ligands synergistically induced the expression of the type I interferon, IFN-β. In mouse colon carcinoma (CT-26) cells, KMR-206 alone induced IFN-β. Both KMR-206 and RBN-2397 increased PARP7 protein levels in CT-26 cells, demonstrating that PARP7’s catalytic activity regulates its own protein levels. Curiously, treatment with saturating doses of KMR-206 and RBN-2397 achieved different levels of PARP7 protein, which correlated with the magnitude of type I interferon gene expression. These latter results have important implications for the mechanism of action of PARP7 inhibitors and highlights the usefulness of having structurally distinct chemical probes for the same target.

Abstract: Summary
Machine learning models are sensitive to the hyperparameters used by the algorithms and, depending on the method and settings, will place different importance on the (structural) features when predicting (property) labels. This is crucial for machine learning in high-performance materials such as MXenes, known for their design flexibility and increasing complexity. To provide unequivocal structure/property relationships for materials science applications, a universal feature importance profile is needed, which can be obtained by using a Rashomon set of high-performing models, even for so-called “black-box” models. Presented here is a method for developing universal feature importance profiles that can be combined with any neural network to provide an interpretation that is insensitive to factors such as the number of layers or neurons. This approach gives more comprehensive insights into the importance of features and allows researchers to control specific property ranges to accommodate their research interests or needs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Summary
The development of efficient processes for the preparation of structurally diverse axially chiral biaryls has been an important goal in synthetic organic chemistry and asymmetric catalysis. However, in sharp contrast to the well-established open-chain biaryls, the catalytic enantioselective construction of medium-sized bridged biaryls remains underdeveloped. In particular, no enantioselective synthesis of such frameworks possessing a configurationally stable stereogenic C-N axis with step- or pot-economy has been disclosed. Herein, we report a practical synthesis of atropisomeric eight-membered lactam-bridged N-arylindoles through a conceptually intriguing stepwise cut-and-sew strategy. The key to success lies in the development of a silver-catalyzed atroposelective ring-opening/cyclization cascade reaction of N-arylindole lactams with isocyanoacetates to establish C-N axial chirality. This method features operational simplicity, good functional group tolerance, high efficiency, as well as good to high enantiocontrol. It is also noteworthy that these scaffolds exhibit large Stokes shifts, demonstrating their potential applications as fluorescent dyes.

Abstract: Myeloid neoplasms result from molecular alterations in hematopoietic stem cells, with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) being one of the most aggressive and with a poor prognosis. Hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) is a proto-oncogene that encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase of the Scr family, and it is highly expressed in AML. The present study investigated HCK expression in normal hematopoietic cells across myeloid differentiation stages and myeloid neoplasm patients. Within the AML cohort, we explored the impact of HCK expression on clinical outcomes and its correlation with clinical, genetic, and laboratory characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluated the association between HCK expression and the response to antineoplastic agents using ex vivo assay data from AML patients. HCK expression is higher in differentiated subpopulations of myeloid cells. High HCK expression was observed in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and AML. In patients with AML, high levels of HCK negatively impacted overall and disease-free survival. High HCK expression was also associated with worse molecular risk groups and white blood cell count; however, it was not an independent prognostic factor. In functional genomic analyses, high HCK expression was associated with several biological and molecular processes relevant to leukemogenesis. HCK expression was also associated with sensitivity and resistance to several drugs currently used in the clinic. In conclusion, our analysis confirmed the differential expression of HCK in myeloid neoplasms and its potential association with unfavorable molecular risks in AML. We also provide new insights into HCK biological functions, prognosis, and response to antineoplastic agents.

Abstract: Background
Erlotinib treatment can lead to skin diseases that drastically affected the quality of life of patients. Quercetin (Que), the active component in Xijiao Dihuang Decoction (XDD), was identified to improve inflammatory skin diseases. However, the mechanism of XDD treating erlotinib-induced cutaneous toxicity was not clear at the molecular level.
Methods
Keratinocytes were treated with erlotinib, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was revealed by ELISA and qRT-PCR. The macrophage polarization was determined by flow cytometry. The key component of XDD, Que, and the target genes of dermatitis were selected via network pharmacology analysis. The binding effects of Que and target genes were verified using molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)-western blot assay. Animal experiments were performed in vivo to verify the therapeutic effect of XDD on erlotinib-induced skin toxicity.
Results
Erlotinib induced M1 polarization of macrophages after stimulating epidermal keratinocytes. While this effect was associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such production was prominently decreased by XDD treatment. By combining network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking, and CETSA, it was confirmed that Que had a binding relationship with IL-2 and CXCL8. In vivo results implied that erlotinib abated tumor growth and stimulated dermatitis in HR-1 nude mice, while Que alleviated erlotinib-induced skin damage without affecting this tumor repression effect.
Conclusion
The results indicated that XDD could relieve the dermatitis induced by erlotinib and provide a favorable theoretical basis for the clinical relief by using this method.

Abstract: Summary
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) crystals are widely used for X-ray detection in applications ranging from medical imaging to non-destructive industrial inspection. The surface charge carrier dynamics and photo-response of the crystals are critical factors that determine their per8formance. Here, we reveal the influence of crystallographic orientation of CdTe crystals on their photo-induced behaviors. Notably, X-ray detector devices fabricated from the (110) lattice plane exhibit more than two-orders of magnitude lower X-ray detection limit and a substantially higher X-ray sensitivity over the devices fabricated from either (100) or (111) crystal planes when subjected to a bias of 0.1 V. These findings are elucidated through comprehensive investigations by time-resolved spectroscopic and four-dimensional electron microscopic experiments, further supported by high-level density functional theory calculations. This discovery highlights the pivotal role of selecting an appropriate crystallographic orientation in enhancing the detection performance of high-energy X-ray sensors, thereby benefiting various X-ray imaging applications.

Abstract: Summary
High operational frequencies of the upcoming 5G network will result in shorter broadcast distances and network dead zones. Additional access points and signal repeaters embedded into the existing infrastructure will therefore be needed. We demonstrate an autonomous communication module based on additively manufactured transparent antenna set to operate at 2.4 GHz. The antenna is made of inkjet-printed indium tin oxide, with visible light transmittance, electrical conductivity, and Haake’s figure of merit of 87%, 1,280 S cm−1, and 4.9 × 10−3 Ω−1, respectively. The antenna enables reliable Bluetooth connection in transmission/reception up to a distance of 10 m with a received signal strength indicator above −80 dBm, being feasible for applications where miniaturization and invisibility of the electronics are essential. The antenna is then connected to a complete communicating system, self-powered by a solar panel, and yields a peak consumption in transmission of 30 mW.

Abstract: Introduction
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a widely used therapy, but its success largely depends on the number and quality of stem cells collected. Current evidence shows the complexity of the hematopoietic system, which implies that, in the quality assurance of the apheresis product, the hematopoietic stem cells are adequately characterized and quantified, in which mass cytometry (MC) can provide its advantages in high-dimensional analysis.
Objective
This research aimed to characterize and enumerate CD45dim/CD34+ stem cells using the MC in apheresis product yields from patients with chronic lymphoid malignant diseases undergoing autologous transplantation at the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center.
Methods
An analytical and cross-sectional study was performed on 31 apheresis products from 15 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma (n = 9) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (n = 6) eligible for HSCT. The MC was employed using the MaxPar Kit for stem cell immunophenotyping. The analysis was performed manually in the Kaluza and unsupervised by machine learning in Cytobank Premium.
Results
An excellent agreement was found between mass and flow cytometry for the relative and absolute counts of CD45dim/CD34+ cells (Bland-Altman bias: -0.029 and -64, respectively), seven subpopulations were phenotyped and no lineage bias was detected for any of the methods used in the pool of collected cells. A CD34+/CD38+/CD138+ population was seen in the analyses performed on four patients with multiple myeloma.
Conclusions
The MC helps to characterize subpopulations of stem cells in apheresis products. It also allows cell quantification by double platform. Unsupervised analysis allows results completion and validation of the manual strategy. The proposed methodology can be extended to apheresis products for purposes other than HSCT.

Abstract: Summary
Two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (2D-RPPs) have emerged as promising candidates for efficient solar cells. However, compositional complexity and their multiphase nature make them particularly susceptible to strain, which can have detrimental effects on their device performance and stability. Here, we focus on cyclohexane methylamine (CMA)-based 2D-RPPs and modulate the strain by substituting iodide with bromide. These mixed-halide 2D-RPPs show excellent optical properties, with mixability and tunable band gap. As the substitution ratio increases, the 2D-RPP framework undergoes a sudden rearrangement in crystal lattice, effectively releasing the strain in lattices. Benefiting from the strain relaxation, the 2D-RPPs exhibit evident improvement in crystallinity, which significantly suppresses recombination in the device and enhances carrier transport across it. Consequently, we achieve an increase of 1.15% in efficiency with the strain-released devices containing (CMA)2MA8Pb9I26.4Br1.6. This device shows significantly improved stability, retaining 93% of the initial efficiency after exposure to 55%–85% relative humidity (RH) for 120 days.

Abstract: Summary
Three-dimensional (3D) interconnects increase chip power density and enable miniaturization. Photonic chips require new processes to enable transitioning to 3D interconnects. We fabricate 3D interconnects on a multijunction solar cell, leveraging processes such as III-V heterostructure plasma etching, gold electrodeposition, and chemical-mechanical polishing to integrate through substrate vias to the heterostructure. Wafer bonding is used to handle 20-μm-thin III-V films. The strategy enables us to demonstrate photonic power devices having areas 3 orders of magnitude smaller compared to standard chips. The design also yields a small shading factor below 3%. Compared to miniaturized photonic power devices with two-dimensional connections, 3D interconnects achieve a 6-fold increase in wafer area use. These improvements will enhance the power yield per wafer while unlocking high-density and miniaturized devices for applications such as power over fiber, the internet of things, and microconcentrator photovoltaics.

Abstract: Summary
Controlling the volatilization and diffusion of co-dopants to afford the uniform distribution of co-doping lanthanide elements with appropriate concentration is crucial to ytterbium (Yb)/erbium (Er) co-doped fiber preforms. Here, volatile and thermostable lanthanide composite Yb0.95Er0.05(thd)3 is proposed and demonstrated to practicably regulate the doping concentration by the fixed Yb/Er molar ratio in the formation, suitable for continuous deposition with simply one raw material transfer line for both Yb and Er elements. Benefiting from more uniform distributions and higher Yb→Er energy transfer efficiency, stronger ErIII-based emission of the Er/Yb co-doped fiber preforms prepared with Yb0.95Er0.05(thd)3 than that with traditional Yb(thd)3/Er(thd)3 is achieved. This work highlights the advantage of this lanthanide composite as a doping reagent in simplifying and uniformizing the deposition of lanthanide-doped fiber preforms, and it establishes the relationship between the doping reagent at molecular levels and the performance of fiber preforms.

Abstract: Summary
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) function is mediated by the process of transcription or through transcript-dependent associations with proteins or nucleic acids to control gene regulatory networks. Many lncRNAs are transcribed in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a postnatal neural stem cell niche. lncRNAs in the V-SVZ are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and brain disease, but their functions are poorly understood. V-SVZ neurogenesis capacity declines with age due to stem cell depletion and resistance to neural stem cell activation. Here we analyzed V-SVZ transcriptomics by pooling current single-cell RNA-seq data. They showed consistent lncRNA expression during stem cell activation, lineage progression, and aging. In conjunction with epigenetic and genetic data, we predicted V-SVZ lncRNAs that regulate stem cell activation and differentiation. Some of the lncRNAs validate known epigenetic mechanisms, but most remain uninvestigated. Our analysis points to several lncRNAs that likely participate in key aspects of V-SVZ stem cell activation and neurogenesis in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Recently, the flexible pulse sensor has emerged as a promising candidate for real-time and population-wide monitoring of cardiovascular health. However, most current technologies are prohibitively expensive, lack clinical validation, or are not designed to diagnose cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Here, we present the development of FlexiPulse, a low-cost, clinically validated, intelligent, flexible pulse detection system for CVD monitoring and diagnostics. The porous graphene-based FlexiPulse is prepared by eco-friendly and economical laser direct-engraving techniques and is feasible for mass production. FlexiPulse achieves high accuracy (>93%), as confirmed by clinical techniques, enabling it to precisely detect subtle changes in cardiovascular status. Furthermore, incorporating machine-learning algorithms in FlexiPulse allows it to perform independent clinical assessments of actual CVD events, including atrial fibrillation and atrial septal defect, with an average accuracy of 98.7%. We believe that FlexiPulse has the potential to promote remote monitoring and in-home care, thereby advancing precision medicine and personalized healthcare significantly.

Abstract: Summary
A primary focus among researchers is to reduce the energy required for CO2 capture. Here, we report a system designed to capture CO2 while simultaneously generating electricity. The reaction heat of amine-CO2 in the point-source CO2-capture process is harvested. Amine-functionalized mixtures (TEPA-SBA/MEA+PZ) exhibit 52% higher reaction enthalpy compared to primary amine absorbents. A membrane composed of tetraethylenepentamine-impregnated poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate is employed, which selectively permeates CO2 and minimizes heat loss by separating the flue gas channel and solvent reservoir. CO2 working capacity of TEPA-SBA/MEA+PZ is 6.6 mmol/g under steady-state conditions of 15 mol % CO2/N2. Electricity can be harvested at a rate of 7.5 kJ/kg, and direct utilization of thermal energy yields 445 kJ/kg (net thermal energy consumption is 2.2 MJ/kg). While the proposed system has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants to 0.25 ton/MWh and increase total electricity production by 0.6%, addressing device energy penalties remains a significant challenge.

Abstract: Multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides allow the identification of multiple cell phenotypes while retaining spatial and morphological context. Multiplex immunofluorescence protocols have already been developed and validated for mouse tissues. Immunophenotyping analysis reliably depicts the immune landscape of cancer tissues that has been demonstrated to influence cancer development and progression as well as to have an impact on therapy responsiveness and resistance. Here, we describe a method for multiplexed fluorescence image analysis, enabling analysis of mouse cancer morphology and cell phenotypes in FFPE sections.

LaNiO2 derivatives constitute a new family of high-temperature superconductors, with the same structure as high-Tc cuprates but based on nickel, only showing superconductivity in thin films for now. We describe a strategy to stabilize LaNiO2 derivatives in bulk: the presence of Al at the octahedral sites helps to stabilize/anchor the infinite-layer structure. The reasons for the bulk being non-superconductors are hotly debated in the literature. An important question is whether there is some hydrogen incorporated into the structure during the reduction process from LaNiO3 to LaNiO2, predicted theoretically but not reported experimentally. Our neutron powder diffraction data show that, indeed, hydrogen occupies the centers of the Ni–O squares, and spectroscopic evidence from EELS and XAS suggests that Ni is reduced to the Ni+ oxidation state, consistent with the crystallochemical data.

Abstract: Summary
Accurately predicting battery aging is critical for mitigating performance degradation during battery usage. While the automotive industry recognizes the importance of utilizing field data for battery performance evaluation and optimization, its practical implementation faces challenges in data collection and the lack of field data-based prognosis methods. To address this, we collect field data from 60 electric vehicles operated for over 4 years and develop a robust data-driven approach for lithium-ion battery aging prediction based on statistical features. The proposed pre-processing methods integrate data cleaning, transformation, and reconstruction. In addition, we introduce multi-level screening techniques to extract statistical features from historical usage behavior. Utilizing machine learning, we accurately predict aging trajectories and worst-lifetime batteries while quantifying prediction uncertainty. This research emphasizes a field data-based framework for battery health management, which not only provides a vital basis for onboard health monitoring and prognosis but also paves the way for battery second-life evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Summary
Safe and reliable fast charging of lithium-ion batteries is contingent upon the development of facile methods of detection and quantification of lithium plating. Among the leading candidates for online lithium plating detection is analysis of the voltage plateau observed during the rest or discharge phase ensuing a charge. In this work, an operando metric, “S-factor,” is developed from electrochemical data to quantitatively analyze the severity of lithium plating over a range of charge rates and temperatures. An in situ visualization method is employed to study the physical mechanisms and phase transitions occurring at the graphite electrode during the voltage plateau. Here, we report that plated electrodes with significant state of charge heterogeneity exhibit multiple voltage plateaus and a higher proportion of irreversible plating. Cell characterization using S-factor and coulombic inefficiency helps in identifying the zone of opportunity with highly reversible lithium plating, facilitating development of safe and reliable fast-charging algorithms.

Abstract: Introduction
The Hb Deer Lodge (β2 His>Arg; HBB:c.8A>G) is a structural hemoglobin variant described in some populations around the world, characterized by increased oxygen affinity, but does not confer clinical symptoms to its carriers. The coinheritance of the Hb Deer Lodge with the most common hemoglobin variant, Hb S, has been reported only once; however, functional data were not described. Here we show a case of the Hb S and Hb Deer Lodge carrier in heterozygosity.
Methods
The Hb S and Hb Deer Lodge association was identified by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), reverse phase HPLC and the β globin gene sequencing. The functional characterization of this interaction was obtained using the O2 dissociation curve, determination of the cooperativity between the globin chains and the Bohr effect in the presence and absence of organic phosphates.
Results
When the Hb S and Hb Deer Lodge were associated, there was a decrease in cooperativity, no significant changes in oxygen affinity and no significant Bohr effect changes.
Conclusion
Despite these genetic variations, the carrier showed no hematological alterations and no clinical symptoms, possibly due to the high oxygen affinity of the Hb Deer Lodge, which interferes with the Hb S polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
Zero-dimensional cesium lead halide (Cs4PbI6) perovskite shows great potential in direct X-ray detection with a low dark current and high stability, but impurity phases including cesium iodide (CsI) and CsPbI3 can easily form in polycrystalline Cs4PbI6 films. Herein, we explore the growth kinetics of Cs4PbI6 polycrystal thick films via spray-coating method by optimizing their structure, composition, and optical properties. Combined experimental and computational studies disclose that under high-temperature annealing, Cs4PbI6 crystals decompose and form impurities, which could be eliminated by controlling the annealing temperature. The optimized thick film enables a high on/off ratio and a super-low dark current (3 nA cm−2) X-ray detector device of an FTO/Cs4PbI6/carbon sandwich with a decent sensitivity of 245 μCGyair−1cm−2 under 30 keV X-ray irradiation at an applied electric field of 55 V mm−1. The device remains stable after continuous operation for a total accumulated dose of 8.17 × 106 mGyair, equivalent to 4 million chest X-ray scans.

Abstract: Summary
Significant accumulation of waste biomass in landfills and greenhouse gas emissions has triggered our current comprehensive approach to depolymerize cellulose-rich waste disposable paper cups (WDPCs) into cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). This work develops a pathway for high-yield, greener, and low-cost CNC production by alkali and maleic acid hydrolysis of recovered fibers following mechanical separation and recycling of WDPCs. The X-ray diffraction confirms polymorphic transformation of CNCs from cellulose I to cellulose II crystal allomorphs with crystallinity indices ranging from 57%–64%. Rice-like CNCs with diameters ranging approximately from 5–10 nm and length 45–80 nm are determined by transmission electron microscopy. The obtained CNCs have good thermal stability and suspension properties. The yield of recovered cellulosic fibers from WDPCs is higher than 85% and CNCs is 70%–75%. The isolated CNCs can be used to develop biodegradable films and barrier coating in packaging to replace non-biodegradable petrochemical-plastics, enabling the transition to a circular economy.

Abstract: Summary
Successful colonization of a host requires bacterial adaptation through genetic and population changes that are incompletely defined. Using chromosomal barcoding and high-throughput sequencing, we investigate the population dynamics of Streptococcus pneumoniae during infant mouse colonization. Within 1 day post inoculation, diversity was reduced >35-fold with expansion of a single clonal lineage. This loss of diversity was not due to immune factors, microbiota, or exclusive genetic drift. Rather, bacteriocins induced by the BlpC-quorum sensing pheromone resulted in predation of kin cells. In this intra-strain competition, the subpopulation reaching a quorum likely eliminates others that have yet to activate the blp locus. Additionally, this reduced diversity restricts the number of unique clones that establish colonization during transmission between hosts. Genetic variation in the blp locus was also associated with altered transmissibility in a human population, further underscoring the importance of BlpC in clonal selection and its role as a selfish element.

Abstract: Background
RFPL1S was first identified as one of the pseudogenes located in the intrachromosomal duplications within 22q12-13. Our previous study found that one of the predicted transcripts of lncRNA RFPL1S, ENST00000419368.1 (GRCh37/hg19), also named as RFPL1S-202 in Ensembl website, is significantly downregulated in the chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. However, its function and underlying mechanism have not been studied.
Methods
Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression. Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell, flow cytometry analysis and tail vein injected mouse model were used to test the function. RNA-sequencing, RNA pull down, western blot, ELISA and RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation were performed for studying the mechanism. 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends were performed to analyze the full length of RFPL1S-202.
Results
RFPL1S-202 is significantly downregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function study indicated that RFPL1S-202 could enhance cisplatin or paclitaxel in cytotoxicity, inhibit cell proliferation, invasion and migration of ovarian cancer cells in vitro, and inhibit the liver metastasis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, RFPL1S-202 could physically interact with DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X) protein, and decrease the expression of p-STAT1 and the IFN inducible genes by increasing the m6A modification of IFNB1. RFPL1S-202 is a spliced and polyadenylated non-coding RNA with a full length of 1071 bp.
Conclusions
Our study suggested that the predicted lncRNA RFPL1S-202 exerts a tumor- suppressive function in oarian cancer chemoresistance and progression by interacting with DDX3X and down-regulating the IFN-β-STAT1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Introduction
Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is characterized by acute systemic microvascular thrombosis and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, especially in delayed diagnosis (later than 6–7 days from symptoms). iTTP data in Brazil is scarce, so we aimed to characterize the clinical presentation and identify predictors of death risk in patients with this disease in Brazil.
Methods
In this single-center retrospective study the patients who underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for presumptive or confirmed iTTP were evaluated regarding the epidemiological, clinical, laboratorial characteristics and management.
Results
A total of 50 patients (90 % female), with median age (IQR) of 34.1 (27–47) years, were enrolled, of which 12 (24 %) died. The most frequent symptoms were neurological (96 %), bleeding (76 %), gastrointestinal (52 %), fever (38 %), and cardiovascular (22 %). Neurological focal deficit and cardiovascular symptoms were more frequently observed in the non-survivor group (P = 0.0019 and P = 0.007, respectively). The mean ± SD number of days from beginning of symptoms to first TPE was 12.22 ± 7.91. We identified an association regarding mortality rate with a score MITS ≥ 2 points (P = 0.04), a higher indirect bilirubin (P = 0.0006), a higher number of transfused red blood cell units (P = 0.025), and platelet transfusion (P = 0.027).
Conclusion
Delayed diagnosis appears to be associated with a higher frequency of neurological symptoms and mortality. Intensity of hemolysis and signs of organ ischemia, such as cardiovascular symptoms and focal neurological deficit, are indicators of death risk.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in single-cell gene expression analysis is to discern meaningful cellular heterogeneity from technical or biological noise. To address this challenge, we present entropy sorting (ES), a mathematical framework that distinguishes genes indicative of cell identity. ES achieves this in an unsupervised manner by quantifying if observed correlations between features are more likely to have occurred due to random chance versus a dependent relationship, without the need for any user-defined significance threshold. On synthetic data, we demonstrate the removal of noisy signals to reveal a higher resolution of gene expression patterns than commonly used feature selection methods. We then apply ES to human pre-implantation embryo single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Previous studies failed to unambiguously identify early inner cell mass (ICM), suggesting that the human embryo may diverge from the mouse paradigm. In contrast, ES resolves the ICM and reveals sequential lineage bifurcations as in the classical model. ES thus provides a powerful approach for maximizing information extraction from high-dimensional datasets such as scRNA-seq data.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogels typically contain large amounts of water (>80 wt %) and suffer from limitations inherent to high water content, including rapid dehydration under ambient conditions and limited mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by the low water content and stable performance of human epidermis, we report a low-water-content polyelectrolyte hydrogel (i.e., L-hydrogel) that mimics the composition of the human epidermal stratum corneum by employing an integrated hydrophobic/hydrophilic network design. The low water content of L-hydrogels (<12 wt %) leads to superior self-healing capability with a healing efficiency of ∼100%, strength and modulus approaching ∼1 MPa, skin-like fracture toughness (3,390 J/m2), and strong natural adhesions (∼120–1,300 N/m) to both wet and dry surfaces. L-hydrogels also possess stable water content and mechanical properties over time under ambient conditions, enabling long-lasting stable functionality for various types of triboelectric nanogenerators and ionic skins. L-hydrogels hold promise for long-term practical applications in soft ionotronics under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving control over the transport properties of charge carriers is a crucial aspect of realizing high-performance electronic materials. In metal-halide perovskites, which offer convenient manufacturing traits and tunability for certain optoelectronic applications, this is challenging: the perovskite structure itself poses fundamental limits to maximum dopant incorporation. Here, we demonstrate an organic modifier incorporation strategy capable of modulating the electronic density of states in halide tin perovskites without altering the perovskite lattice, in a similar fashion to substitutional doping in traditional semiconductors. By incorporating organic small molecules and conjugated polymers into cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3) perovskites, we achieve carrier density tunability over 2.7 decades, transition from a temperature-dependent semiconducting to a metallic nature, and high electrical conductivity exceeding 200 S/cm. We leverage these tunable and enhanced electronic properties to achieve a thin-film, lead-free, thermoelectric material with a near room temperature figure of merit of 0.21.

Abstract: Summary
In the osmotic power generation field, reaching the industrial benchmark has been challenging because of the need for capillaries close to the sizes of ions and molecules. Here, we fabricate well-controlled “along-the-capillary” membranes of Na-vermiculite with a capillary size of ∼ 5 Å. They exhibit 1,600 times enhanced conductivity compared with commonly studied “across-the-capillary” membranes. Interestingly, they show a very high cation selectivity of 0.83 for NaCl solutions, which results in large power densities of 9.6 W/m2 and 12.2 W/m2 at concentration gradients of 50 and 1,000, respectively, at 296 K, for a large membrane length of 100 μm. The power density shows an exponential increase with temperature, reaching 65.1 W/m2 for a concentration gradient of 50 at 333 K. This markedly differs from the classical behavior and indicates the role of ion (de)hydration in enhancing power density, opening possibilities for exploiting such membranes for energy harvesting applications.

Abstract: Summary
The fan worm (Annelida: Sabellidae) inhabits a mineral tube and obtains its nourishment by filtering surrounding water through its corolla-like tentacles. This creature features ultrafast retraction to its narrow tube for escaping external dangers, a process greatly aided by its self-secreted mucus lubricating the tube wall. However, the mucus may render the tube wall too slippery for the worm feet (parapodia) to crawl on. How the fan worm can steadily crawl in the tube against the mucous surface remains highly elusive. Here, we show that the fan worm exhibits a triple-leveled locomotion system and that each level can cooperate to achieve stable motion when the worm is extending out from the slippery tube underwater. In addition, we designed a fan-worm-inspired robot equipped with bionic foot pads that can stably crawl on mucous surfaces. This biological system can spark new design ideas for intelligent robots that explore the slippery environment underwater.

Abstract: Summary
Humanity has faced three recent outbreaks of novel betacoronaviruses, emphasizing the need to develop approaches that broadly target coronaviruses. Here, we identify 55 monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors that bind diverse betacoronavirus spike proteins. Most antibodies targeted an S2 epitope that included the K814 residue and were non-neutralizing. However, 11 antibodies targeting the stem helix neutralized betacoronaviruses from different lineages. Eight antibodies in this group, including the six broadest and most potent neutralizers, were encoded by IGHV1-46 and IGKV3-20. Crystal structures of three antibodies of this class at 1.5–1.75-Å resolution revealed a conserved mode of binding. COV89-22 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including Omicron BA.4/5 and limited disease in Syrian hamsters. Collectively, these findings identify a class of IGHV1-46/IGKV3-20 antibodies that broadly neutralize betacoronaviruses by targeting the stem helix but indicate these antibodies constitute a small fraction of the broadly reactive antibody response to betacoronaviruses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular conversion can be induced by perturbing a handful of key transcription factors (TFs). Replacement of direct manipulation of key TFs with chemical compounds offers a less laborious and safer strategy to drive cellular conversion for regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, identifying optimal chemical compounds currently requires large-scale screening of chemical libraries, which is resource intensive. Existing computational methods aim at predicting cell conversion TFs, but there are no methods for identifying chemical compounds targeting these TFs. Here, we develop a single cell-based platform (SiPer) to systematically prioritize chemical compounds targeting desired TFs to guide cellular conversions. SiPer integrates a large compendium of chemical perturbations on non-cancer cells with a network model and predicted known and novel chemical compounds in diverse cell conversion examples. Importantly, we applied SiPer to develop a highly efficient protocol for human hepatic maturation. Overall, SiPer provides a valuable resource to efficiently identify chemical compounds for cell conversion.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited and multisystem blood disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), progressive multiorgan damage and increased mortality. In Brazil, it is one of the most common monogenic diseases afflicting 60,000 to 100,000 individuals, however, there are sparse epidemiological data, as well as information on the utilization of public healthcare resources. Method: This was a 5-year (2016 - 2020) retrospective study conducted at one Brazilian reference center on SCD - Santa Casa de Sao Paulo, in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Results
Among a total of 100 eligible adult patients, the median age was 31.0 years old, 84% of the patients were aged between 18 and 45 years old; 59% were women and 91% presented the genotype HbSS. The number of hematologist and non-hematologist visits at the outpatient unit were 2,198 and 1,436, respectively. The number of hospital ER visits was 758, of which 51% required 864 days of hospitalization. The main cause for seeking hospital medical care was the VOCs. The numbers and ratios of VOCs were: 1 to 10 VOCs, 64%; 11 to 20, 15%, and; 21 or more, 1%. There was a statistically significant difference between the number of VOCs and hospitalizations, as well as infection. Conclusion: Results indicate the burden of SCD on Brazilian patients’ daily lives, the impact of VOCs on public healthcare resources, the importance of having a national surveillance program to improve resource utilization and clinical outcomes of patients with SCD and the urgent need for the revitalizing of the current national comprehensive SCD care programs.

Abstract: Although most cells are mononuclear, the nucleus can exist in the form of binucleate or even multinucleate to respond to different physiological processes. The male accessory gland of Drosophila is the organ that produces semen, and its main cells are binucleate. Here we observe that CTP synthase (CTPS) forms filamentous cytoophidia in binuclear main cells, primarily located at the cell boundary. In CTPSH355A, a point mutation that destroys the formation of cytoophidia, we find that the nucleation mode of the main cells changes, including mononucleates and vertical distribution of binucleates. Although the overexpression of CTPSH355A can restore the level of CTPS protein, it will neither form cytoophidia nor eliminate the abnormal nucleation pattern. Therefore, our data indicate that there is an unexpected functional link between the formation of cytoophidia and the maintenance of binucleation in Drosophila main cells.

Abstract: Oxidative stress caused by excess ROS often leads to cellular macromolecule damage and eventually causes various biological catastrophes. Sirt6, a member of the mammalian homolog family of yeast Sir2 NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, regulates multiple biological processes. Sirt6 exerts antioxidative functions by enhancing DNA repair and DNA end resection. In our study, we found that Sirt6 expression was induced by H2O2 and paraquat (PQ) in cells. When exposed to PQ, the Sirt6+/− C57BL/6 mice showed more serious liver damage and lower survival rate than the Sirt6+/+ mice. The Nrf2 protein levels and the mRNA levels of its target genes in mouse tissues were decreased by Sirt6 deficiency, and Sirt6 overexpression increased the Nrf2 protein content. Moreover, the endogenous H2O2 levels were increased in the tissues of Sirt6-deficient mice and were decreased in Sirt6 overexpression cells. Then, we found that Nrf2 was degraded faster in the Sirt6-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than in the wild type MEFs and that Sirt6 enhanced the protein accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. Lastly, we found that Sirt6 interacted with Nrf2 in co-IP and GST pull-down assays and that Sirt6 overexpression decreased the binding of Nrf2 to Keap1. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that Sirt6 exerts antioxidative functions by increasing the Nrf2 protein level via Keap1-mediated regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Due to their nanoscale scattering cross section, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have never been reported for crystallite size or similar characteristics. Here, we characterize the average structure thermal domain size of SWCNTs. This characteristic size reflects the average mean free path of low-momentum phonon scattering. The characterization itself involves measuring the thermal reffusivity of SWCNT bundles in the axial direction down to 77 K and determining the residual value at the 0 K limit. This residual value reflects the sole structure-phonon scattering due to vanishing Umklapp scattering. We obtain the average structure thermal domain sizes of two SWCNT bundles, which are 46.0 and 61.9 nm. Since there is no other characteristic size information available to compare for SWCNTs, we compare the structure thermal domain size of other micro-/nanoscale materials with their crystallite size by X-ray diffraction to interpret our results.

Abstract: Summary
While there is considerable focus on latent-based thermal energy storage (TES) systems, the low thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCMs) remains a critical concern. Many approaches to enhance PCM conductivity either require complicated synthesis processes or are cost prohibitive. In this study, we investigate finned-tube modular TES systems, which are simple in design, easy to manufacture, and cost-effective due to their standard materials and components. The study includes detailed modeling and experimentation of two devices containing similar amounts of PCM but different fin spacings. The study reveals that having more fins does not necessarily increase the TES thermal performance because the reduction in the PCM volume fraction can reduce the TES volumetric and specific energy densities. We find that larger fin spacings provide a higher specific energy for lower C rates (<1C), while smaller fin spacings provide a higher specific energy for higher C rates (>1C).

Abstract: Summary
The reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid C3+ chemicals is a potential net-zero carbon process that can increase local resiliency to power outages and fuel consumption. However, the mechanism and catalyst design rules to promote CO2RR-to-C3+ are unknown. Engineering bimetallic interfaces (e.g., palladium/gold) to tune intermediate adsorption is promising for promoting C3+ formation. Our density functional theory calculations find that ∗CH2 could be the key intermediate, and C1–CH2 coupling could be the rate-limiting step to generate C3+. High CO surface coverages can promote the bimetallic interfacial sites, lower the energetics of the C1–CH2 coupling step, and enhance C3+ formation. We further construct a volcano plot of C1–CH2 kinetics as a function of the binding strength of key intermediate ∗CH2 via engineering the d-band center of the interfacial site. Our findings could guide the rational design of bimetallic interfaces and their near-surface microenvironment for enhancing CO2RR-to-C3+.

Abstract: Summary
Co-utilization of silicon (Si) and graphite (Gr) has become a commercially viable route to achieve higher energy density before the realization of pure Si anodes. However, the challenges of poor dispersion in the aqueous binder and structural stability faced with Si/Gr remain difficult to negotiate. Herein, inspired by the outstanding adhesive ability of pyrogallol-containing proteins in tunicates, a water-soluble binder polyvinyl alcohol-gallic acid (PVA-GA) is synthesized via a one-step esterification reaction. Multiple supramolecular interactions of π−π stacking and hydrogen bonding are introduced to favor the homogeneous distribution of Si/Gr and the excellent structural stability of Si/Gr electrodes. The Si/Gr-PVA-GA delivers a high specific capacity of 568.6 mAh g−1 over 200 cycles, corresponding to 91.5% capacity retention and 0.038% capacity loss per cycle. Furthermore, the good practicality is demonstrated by the stable and safe operation of a Si/Gr||LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 full cell with a practical level of areal capacity up to 3 mAh cm−2.

Abstract: Summary
Non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation produces alkene and hydrogen products. The current processes face three challenges: limited conversion due to thermodynamics, rapid catalyst deactivation, and CO2 emissions from process heating. A membrane reactor (MR) has the potential to overcome the thermodynamic limit by removing H2 in situ, but both catalyst and membrane tend to deactivate quickly. Here, we report a carbon membrane reactor that integrates H2-permeable carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes and siliceous zeolite-supported metal catalysts. By lowering the reaction temperature using catalysts with a low threshold temperature and by overcoming the thermodynamic limit with CMS membranes, we achieve high conversion and catalyst stability. The electro-conductive nature of the CMS membrane enables joule heating of the reaction, reducing CO2 emissions. We demonstrate a CMS membrane reactor with record-high stability for propylene and ethylene production, the second- and first-largest-volume chemicals used as feedstock globally.

Abstract: The immunomodulatory properties of local hypofractionated radiotherapy are known to promote the generation of anti-tumor immune responses. Such responses are largely due to the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes (TILs) into the tumors that are able to destroy malignant lesions. In this context, characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment following radiotherapy is crucial for the study of its mechanism of action. Flow cytometry-based analyses are frequently used to elucidate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment. The use of a fluorochrome-conjugated antibody panel is currently a standard technique to assess the number and phenotype of immune cell populations infiltrating the tumors. Here, we describe a method to isolate and quantify TILs based on flow-cytometry in mammary carcinoma-bearing mice that undergo a local hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen consisting of 3 consecutive doses of 8 Gy. With some adaptations, this protocol can be successfully applied to a diverse range of transplantable and inducible solid mouse tumors of different origins.

Abstract: Summary
While promising catalysts are constantly being discovered for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), none have surpassed platinum’s performance, despite its intrinsic activity being underestimated. A thorough assessment of intrinsic activity is therefore necessary to understand platinum’s superior performance. Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy to overcome limitations in proton and hydrogen mass transport at multiple scales. Reliable HER current transients with steady-state limiting current densities far above the exchange current density are recorded (jl of 4 A/cm2 with a 440 nm pipette) in acid electrolyte. Furthermore, exchange current density analysis shows that platinum’s intrinsic activity (230 ± 34 mA/cm2) is over 200-fold higher than reported in rotating disc measurements (1 mA/cm2), 3-fold higher than the H2 pump method (75 mA/cm2), and almost twice that from micropolarization analysis (140 mA/cm2). These findings demonstrate the importance of mass transport in achieving high-current-density electrocatalysis and reveal platinum’s underestimated intrinsic activity.

Abstract: Summary
Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is recognized as a promising strategy for extracting atmospheric moisture to provide arid regions with potable water. As appropriate sorbents are crucial for efficient SAWH, many novel sorbents have been developed in recent years. However, the lack of benchmarks prevents the accurate evaluation of sorbents’ performance for system-oriented and location-/climate-specific selection. Herein, reliable models are established to analyze the global SAWH potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in terms of practical water yields and energy requirements for passive and active SAWH, respectively. Moreover, geospatial guidance of the efficient MOF-assisted AWH deployment is provided based on a thermodynamic framework in combination with high-resolution global weather data throughout a year with seasonal climate variation. Overall, this study establishes benchmarks for location- and climate-specific adsorbents that will expand the application of sorbent-assisted water-harvesting technologies in effective off-grid water-supply systems in water-scarce regions.

Abstract: Summary
Flaviviruses have posed a serious threat to human health in the past decades, and effective therapeutic drugs are lacking; thus, treatment of flavivirus infection is a great challenge. The flavivirus protease NS2B3 is an attractive target for antiviral drug screening. Here, we developed an intracellular Zika virus (ZIKV) NS2AB3 self-cleavage assay to identify inhibitors that interfere with viral polyprotein cleavage and block ZIKV/dengue virus (DENV) replication. Bortezomib was identified as the most potent inhibitor, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) in the nanomolar range. We found that instead of directly inhibiting NS2B3 protease activity, bortezomib dramatically induced the ubiquitination and aggregation of NS3, leading to the attenuation of its protease activity in cells. Two E3 ligases, HRD1 and RNF126, were found to be responsible for NS3 ubiquitination. Our study identifies bortezomib as a potential drug for the treatment of ZIKV/DENV infection and reveals the central role of the ERAD pathway in the inhibition of flaviviruses by bortezomib.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising energy-storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, LSBs’ practical energy density is limited by a large electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratio (>5 μL mg−1 S), and their reversible operation encounters challenges from electrode passivation and Li dendrite formation. Herein, we report a strategy for enhancing LSBs’ performance by using a cationic surfactant-based electrolyte additive: tetramethylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TAHP). The stronger electrostatic interaction between the tetramethylammonium cation and the short-chain polysulfide (PS) anion promotes the reduction of long-chain PS to short-chain PS, inducing 3D particulate deposition of Li2S and thus increasing both sulfur utilization and discharge potential, alleviating electrode passivation. Moreover, tetramethylammonium cations can adsorb around Li protrusions to form a lithiophobic protective layer that inhibits the formation of Li dendrites. As a result, the TAHP lithium-sulfur pouch cell maintained an excellent capacity retention ratio with 78.3% after 250 cycles under lean-electrolyte conditions (4.5 μL mg−1 sufur [S]).

Abstract: Summary
Redondoviruses are circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS) viruses of high prevalence in healthy humans. Redondovirus abundance is increased in oro-respiratory samples from individuals with periodontitis, acute illness, and severe COVID-19. We investigated potential host cells supporting redondovirus replication in oro-respiratory samples and uncovered the oral amoeba Entamoeba gingivalis as a likely host. Redondoviruses are closely related to viruses of Entamoeba and contain reduced GC nucleotide content, consistent with Entamoeba hosts. Redondovirus and E. gingivalis co-occur in metagenomic data from oral disease and healthy human cohorts. When grown in xenic cultures with feeder bacteria, E. gingivalis was robustly positive for redondovirus RNA and DNA. A DNA proximity-ligation assay (Hi-C) on xenic culture cells showed enriched cross-linking of redondovirus and Entamoeba DNA, supporting E. gingivalis as the redondovirus host. While bacteria are established hosts for bacteriophages within the human virome, this work shows that eukaryotic commensals also contribute an abundant human-associated virus.

Abstract: In the previous study, we originally developed cancer stem cells (CSCs) models from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) by culturing miPSCs in the conditioned medium of cancer cell lines, which mimiced as carcinoma microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanism of conversion in detail remains to be uncovered. Microarray analysis of the CSCs models in this study revealed Dsg2, one of the members of the desmosomal cadherin family, was up-regulated when compared with the original miPSCs. Moreover, the expression of key factors in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were also found up-regulated in one of the CSCs models, named miPS-LLCcm. An autocrine loop was implied between Dsg2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway when miPSCs were treated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activators, Wnt3a and CHIR99021, and when the CSCs model were treated with inhibitors, IWR-1 and IWP-2. Furthermore, the ability of proliferation and self-renewal in the CSCs model was markedly decreased in vitro and in vivo when Dsg2 gene was knocked down by shRNA. Our results showed that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated by the up-regulation of Dsg2 expresssion during the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs implying a potential mechanism of the tranformation of stem cells into malignant phenotype.
