Abstract: Summary
Signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key transcription factor implicated in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. Although Stat3 deletion in tubular epithelial cells is known to protect mice from fibrosis, vFoxd1 cells remains unclear. Using Foxd1-mediated Stat3 knockout mice, CRISPR, and inhibitors of STAT3, we investigate its function. STAT3 is phosphorylated in tubular epithelial cells in acute kidney injury, whereas it is expanded to interstitial cells in fibrosis in mice and humans. Foxd1-mediated deletion of Stat3 protects mice from folic-acid- and aristolochic-acid-induced kidney fibrosis. Mechanistically, STAT3 upregulates the inflammation and differentiates pericytes into myofibroblasts. STAT3 activation increases migration and profibrotic signaling in genome-edited, pericyte-like cells. Conversely, blocking Stat3 inhibits detachment, migration, and profibrotic signaling. Furthermore, STAT3 binds to the Collagen1a1 promoter in mouse kidneys and cells. Together, our study identifies a previously unknown function of STAT3 that promotes kidney fibrosis and has therapeutic value in fibrosis.

Abstract: Exocytotic release of hormones from endocrine cells must encompass mechanisms that direct the hormone into the blood stream. Increasing evidence indicates an intimate link between pancreatic β-cells and the capillary bed of islets of Langerhans in both mouse and human. Integrins are exclusively activated at the region where β-cells contact extracellular matrix proteins that surround the islet capillaries; furthermore, insulin granule exocytosis is targeted to this same region, therefore delivering hormone directly into the blood stream. In this review we discuss evidence suggesting that the capillary interface of β-cells forms a specialised domain that is analogous to the presynaptic active zone of neurones. Pancreatic β-cells possess many of the same proteins as found in the neuronal active zone, including several key presynaptic scaffold proteins. These scaffold proteins are enriched at the capillary interface of β-cells and some have also been shown to control insulin secretion. We present a model that suggests this active zone-like domain in β-cells may anchor key components of the stimulus secretion cascade, to not only target granule exocytosis to this region but also function as a significant regulator of insulin secretion.

Abstract: Both matrix stiffening and remodeling of calcium signaling occur in breast cancers, with downstream consequences linked to the progression of the disease. However, the potential intersection between calcium signaling and matrix stiffness has not been fully assessed in models of cancer. Here, we describe the assessment of calcium signaling in breast cancer cells at high and low matrix stiffness using novel gel culture models (gelatin methacryloyl and polydimethylsiloxane) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6m. Remodeling of ATP-stimulated cytosolic calcium responses in cells on different matrices was assessed using a high throughput fluorescence imaging plate reader. Our data reveal that matrices of higher stiffness attenuate ATP-induced sustained calcium influx in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This matrix-mediated attenuation of sustained calcium influx was dependent on the store-operated calcium channel component ORAI1. These studies suggest that calcium signaling in breast cancer cells can be altered as a consequence of matrix stiffness; modulation of such pathways may represent a new mechanism to target calcium signaling to regulate tumor progression in breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
IDO1 oxidizes tryptophan (TRP) to generate kynurenine (KYN), the substrate for 1-carbon and NAD metabolism, and is implicated in pro-cancer pathophysiology and infection biology. However, the mechanistic relationships between IDO1 in amino acid depletion versus product generation have remained a longstanding mystery. We found an unrecognized link between IDO1 and cell survival mediated by KYN that serves as the source for molecules that inhibit ferroptotic cell death. We show that this effect requires KYN export from IDO1-expressing cells, which is then available for non-IDO1-expressing cells via SLC7A11, the central transporter involved in ferroptosis suppression. Whether inside the “producer” IDO1+ cell or the “receiver” cell, KYN is converted into downstream metabolites, suppressing ferroptosis by ROS scavenging and activating an NRF2-dependent, AHR-independent cell-protective pathway, including SLC7A11, propagating anti-ferroptotic signaling. IDO1, therefore, controls a multi-pronged protection pathway from ferroptotic cell death, underscoring the need to re-evaluate the use of IDO1 inhibitors in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
In chemical sensation, multiple models have been proposed to explain how odors are represented in the olfactory cortex. One hypothesis is that the combinatorial identity of active neurons within sniff-related time windows is critical, whereas another model proposes that it is the temporal structure of neural activity that is essential for encoding odor information. We find that top-down feedback to the main olfactory bulb dictates the information transmitted to the piriform cortex and switches between these coding strategies. Using a detailed network model, we demonstrate that feedback control of inhibition influences the excitation-inhibition balance in mitral cells, restructuring the dynamics of piriform cortical cells. This results in performance improvement in odor discrimination tasks. These findings present a framework for early olfactory computation, where top-down feedback to the bulb flexibly shapes the temporal structure of neural activity in the piriform cortex, allowing the early olfactory system to dynamically switch between two distinct coding models.

Abstract: Summary
Cdc48 (p97/VCP) is a AAA-ATPase that can extract ubiquitinated proteins from their binding partners and can cooperate with the proteasome for their degradation. A fission yeast cdc48 mutant (cdc48-353) shows low levels of the cohesin protease, separase, and pronounced chromosome segregation defects in mitosis. Separase initiates chromosome segregation when its binding partner securin is ubiquitinated and degraded. The low separase levels in the cdc48-353 mutant have been attributed to a failure to extract ubiquitinated securin from separase, resulting in co-degradation of separase along with securin. If true, Cdc48 would be important in mitosis. In contrast, we show here that low separase levels in the cdc48-353 mutant are independent of mitosis. Moreover, we find no evidence of enhanced separase degradation in the mutant. Instead, we suggest that the cdc48-353 mutant uncovers specific requirements for separase translation. Our results highlight a need to better understand how this key mitotic enzyme is synthesized.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms coupling fate specification of distinct tissues to their physical separation remain to be understood. The trachea and esophagus differentiate from a single tube of definitive endoderm, requiring the transcription factors SOX2 and NKX2-1, but how the dorsoventral site of tissue separation is defined to allocate tracheal and esophageal cell types is unknown. Here, we show that the EPH/EPHRIN signaling gene Efnb2 regulates tracheoesophageal separation by controlling the dorsoventral allocation of tracheal-fated cells. Ventral loss of NKX2-1 results in disruption of separation and expansion of Efnb2 expression in the trachea independent of SOX2. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays, we find that NKX2-1 likely represses Efnb2 directly. Lineage tracing shows that loss of NKX2-1 results in misallocation of ventral foregut cells into the esophagus, while mosaicism for Nkx2-1 generates ectopic NKX2-1/EPHRIN-B2 boundaries that organize ectopic tracheal separation. Together, these data demonstrate that NKX2-1 coordinates tracheal specification with tissue separation through the regulation of EPHRIN-B2 and tracheoesophageal cell sorting.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 is inactivated by over hundreds of heterogenous mutations in cancer. Here, we purposefully selected phenotypically reversible temperature-sensitive (TS) p53 mutations for pharmacological rescue with thermostability as the compound-screening readout. This rational screening identified antiparasitic drug potassium antimony tartrate (PAT) as an agent that can thermostabilize the representative TS mutant p53-V272M via noncovalent binding. PAT met the three basic criteria for a targeted drug: availability of a co-crystal structure, compatible structure-activity relationship, and intracellular target specificity, consequently exhibiting antitumor activity in a xenograft mouse model. At the antimony dose in clinical antiparasitic therapy, PAT effectively and specifically rescued p53-V272M in patient-derived primary leukemia cells in single-cell RNA sequencing. Further scanning of 815 frequent p53-missense mutations identified 65 potential PAT-treatable mutations, most of which were temperature sensitive. These results lay the groundwork for repurposing noncovalent antiparasitic antimonials for precisely treating cancers with the 65 p53 mutations.

Abstract: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects over a million people worldwide, characterized by photoreceptor cell death, progressive retinal degeneration, and visual loss. Metformin is demonstrated as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing light-induced retinal degeneration by decreasing apoptosis and oxidative stress. This work aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on the retina of the N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced rat model of RP. Eighteen adult male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Group I: normal vehicle control (N = 6). Group II: ENU-induced photoreceptor degeneration (N = 12) received a single intraperitoneal injection of ENU at a 600 mg/kg dose. Rats in group II were equally divided into two subgroups: IIa: photoreceptor degeneration-induced group and IIb: metformin-treated group (200 mg/kg) for seven days. Specimens from the retina were processed for light and electron microscopy. In ENU treated group, the retina revealed vacuolations and morphological changes in the glia (Müller cells and microglia) and blood capillaries. Increasing caspase-3 (apoptotic marker), iNOS (oxidative stress marker), CD68 (macrophage marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression were detected. In the metformin-treated group, the retinal vacuolations reduced with the morphological improvement in the glia and blood capillaries. Caspase-3, iNOS, CD68, and GFAP expression decreased. Metformin was found to have a neuroprotective effect on the retina in ENU induced rat model of RP

Abstract: Summary
Despite repeated associations between T cell infiltration and outcome, human ovarian cancer remains poorly responsive to immunotherapy. We report that the hallmarks of tumor recognition in ovarian cancer-infiltrating T cells are primarily restricted to tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells. Single-cell RNA/TCR/ATAC sequencing of 83,454 CD3+CD8+CD103+CD69+ TRM cells and immunohistochemistry of 122 high-grade serous ovarian cancers shows that only progenitor (TCF1low) tissue-resident T cells (TRMstem cells), but not recirculating TCF1+ T cells, predict ovarian cancer outcome. TRMstem cells arise from transitional recirculating T cells, which depends on antigen affinity/persistence, resulting in oligoclonal, trogocytic, effector lymphocytes that eventually become exhausted. Therefore, ovarian cancer is indeed an immunogenic disease, but that depends on ∼13% of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (∼3% of CD8+ clonotypes), which are primed against high-affinity antigens and maintain waves of effector TRM-like cells. Our results define the signature of relevant tumor-reactive T cells in human ovarian cancer, which could be applicable to other tumors with unideal mutational burden.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed that adult white adipose tissue (WAT) harbors functionally diverse subpopulations of mesenchymal stromal cells that differentially impact tissue plasticity. To date, the molecular basis of this cellular heterogeneity has not been fully defined. Here, we describe a multilayered omics approach to dissect adipose progenitor cell heterogeneity in three dimensions: progenitor subpopulation, sex, and anatomical localization. We applied state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods to quantify 4,870 proteins in eight different stromal cell populations from perigonadal and inguinal WAT of male and female mice and acquired transcript expression levels of 15,477 genes using RNA-seq. Our data unveil molecular signatures defining sex differences in preadipocyte differentiation and identify regulatory pathways that functionally distinguish adipose progenitor subpopulations. This multilayered omics analysis, freely accessible at http://preadprofiler.net/, provides unprecedented insights into adipose stromal cell heterogeneity and highlights the benefit of complementary proteomics to support findings from scRNA-seq studies.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory B cells (Bregs) suppress immune responses through the secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10). This immunomodulatory capacity holds therapeutic potential, yet a definitional immunophenotype for enumeration and prospective isolation of B cells capable of IL-10 production remains elusive. Here, we simultaneously quantify cytokine production and immunophenotype in human peripheral B cells across a range of stimulatory conditions and time points using mass cytometry. Our analysis shows that multiple functional B cell subsets produce IL-10 and that no phenotype uniquely identifies IL-10+ B cells. Further, a significant portion of IL-10+ B cells co-express the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Despite this heterogeneity, operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients have a unique enrichment of IL-10+, but not TNFα+ or IL-6+, B cells compared with transplant recipients receiving immunosuppression. Thus, human IL-10-producing B cells constitute an induced, transient state arising from a diversity of B cell subsets that may contribute to maintenance of immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
A main feature of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is increased susceptibility to autoimmunity. A key contribution of B cells to development of these complications has been demonstrated through studies of samples from affected individuals and mouse models of the disease, but the role of the WAS protein (WASp) in controlling peripheral tolerance has not been specifically explored. Here we show that B cell responses remain T cell dependent in constitutive WASp-deficient mice, whereas selective WASp deletion in germinal center B cells (GCBs) is sufficient to induce broad development of self-reactive antibodies and kidney pathology, pointing to loss of germinal center tolerance as a primary cause leading to autoimmunity. Mechanistically, we show that WASp is upregulated in GCBs and regulates apoptosis and plasma cell differentiation in the germinal center and that the somatic hypermutation-derived diversification is the basis of autoantibody development.

Abstract: Summary
It is not clear how the complex interactions between diet and intestinal immune cells protect the gut from infection. Neutral ceramidase (NcDase) plays a critical role in digesting dietary sphingolipids. We find that NcDase is an essential factor that controls intestinal immune cell dynamics. Mice lacking NcDase have reduced cluster of differentiation (CD) 8αβ+ T cells and interferon (IFN)-γ+ T cells and increased macrophages in the intestine and fail to clear bacteria after Citrobacter rodentium infection. Mechanistically, cellular NcDase or extracellular vesicle (EV)-related NcDase generates sphingosine, which promotes macrophage-driven Th1 immunity. Loss of NcDase influences sphingosine-controlled glycolytic metabolism in macrophages, which regulates the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Importantly, administration of dietary sphingomyelin and genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SphK1 can protect against C. rodentium infection. Our findings demonstrate that sphingosine profoundly alters macrophage glycolytic metabolism, leading to intestinal macrophage activation and T cell polarization, which prevent pathogen colonization of the gut.

Abstract: Background
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) belongs to non-small cell lung carcinoma, and the metastasis is the main cause of death in LUAD patients. It is generally accepted that cell adhesion is closely associated with tumor metastasis. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate the functions of CLEC3B to the invasion, adhesion, and migration of LUAD cells.
Methods
Through bioinformatic analysis, CLEC3B level was found markedly down-regulated in LUAD tissue. Parallel-plate flow chamber, wound-healing and Transwell assays were taken to detect the cell adhesion, invasion, and migration. qRT-PCR and western blot analyzed expression of CLEC3B, p53 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker.
Results
When CLEC3B was lowly-expressed in LUAD cell lines, the cell adhesion capability was also lowered, with the EMT, migration and invasion of the cells progressed. Abnormal expression of CLEC3B was related to p53 signaling pathway.
Conclusion
Above all, a further investigation of the function of CLEC3B in LUAD helps us further understand the molecular mechanism of the tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing factor mutations are common among cancers, recently emerging as drivers of myeloid malignancies. U2AF1 carries hotspot mutations in its RNA-binding motifs; however, how they affect splicing and promote cancer remain unclear. The U2AF1/U2AF2 heterodimer is critical for 3′ splice site (3′SS) definition. To specifically unmask changes in U2AF1 function in vivo, we developed a crosslinking and immunoprecipitation procedure that detects contacts between U2AF1 and the 3′SS AG at single-nucleotide resolution. Our data reveal that the U2AF1 S34F and Q157R mutants establish new 3′SS contacts at −3 and +1 nucleotides, respectively. These effects compromise U2AF2-RNA interactions, resulting predominantly in intron retention and exon exclusion. Integrating RNA binding, splicing, and turnover data, we predicted that U2AF1 mutations directly affect stress granule components, which was corroborated by single-cell RNA-seq. Remarkably, U2AF1-mutant cell lines and patient-derived MDS/AML blasts displayed a heightened stress granule response, pointing to a novel role for biomolecular condensates in adaptive oncogenic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play critical roles in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying MDSC and TAM development and function remain unclear. In this study, we find that myeloid-specific activation of Notch/RBP-J signaling downregulates lactate transporter MCT2 transcription via its downstream molecule Hes1, leading to reduced intracellular lactate levels, blunted granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC) differentiation, and enhanced TAM maturation. We identify c-Jun as a novel intracellular sensor of lactate in myeloid cells using liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) followed by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption. Meanwhile, lactate interacts with c-Jun to protect from FBW7 ubiquitin-ligase-mediated degradation. Activation of Notch signaling and blockade of lactate import repress tumor progression by remodeling myeloid development. Consistently, the relationship between the Notch-MCT2/lactate-c-Jun axis in myeloid cells and tumorigenesis is also confirmed in clinical lung cancer biopsies.

Abstract: Summary
The NADase SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1) is a key executioner of axon degeneration and a therapeutic target for several neurodegenerative conditions. We show that a potent SARM1 inhibitor undergoes base exchange with the nicotinamide moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to produce the bona fide inhibitor 1AD. We report structures of SARM1 in complex with 1AD, NAD+ mimetics and the allosteric activator nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN binding triggers reorientation of the armadillo repeat (ARM) domains, which disrupts ARM:TIR interactions and leads to formation of a two-stranded TIR domain assembly. The active site spans two molecules in these assemblies, explaining the requirement of TIR domain self-association for NADase activity and axon degeneration. Our results reveal the mechanisms of SARM1 activation and substrate binding, providing rational avenues for the design of new therapeutics targeting SARM1.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics are deployed against bacterial pathogens, but their targeting of conserved microbial processes means they also collaterally perturb the commensal microbiome. To understand acute and persistent effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota of healthy adult volunteers, we quantify microbiome dynamics before, during, and 6 months after exposure to 4 commonly used antibiotic regimens. We observe an acute decrease in species richness and culturable bacteria after antibiotics, with most healthy adult microbiomes returning to pre-treatment species richness after 2 months, but with an altered taxonomy, resistome, and metabolic output, as well as an increased antibiotic resistance burden. Azithromycin delays the recovery of species richness, resulting in greater compositional distance. A subset of volunteers experience a persistent reduction in microbiome diversity after antibiotics and share compositional similarities with patients hospitalized in intensive care units. These results improve our quantitative understanding of the impact of antibiotics on commensal microbiome dynamics, resilience, and recovery.

Abstract: Summary
An epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype with cancer stem cell-like properties is a critical feature of aggressive/metastatic tumors, but the mechanism(s) that promote it and its relation to metabolic stress remain unknown. Here we show that Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2A (CRMP2A) is unexpectedly and reversibly induced in cancer cells in response to multiple metabolic stresses, including low glucose and hypoxia, and inhibits EMT/stemness. Loss of CRMP2A, when metabolic stress decreases (e.g., around blood vessels in vivo) or by gene deletion, induces extensive microtubule remodeling, increased glutamine utilization toward pyrimidine synthesis, and an EMT/stemness phenotype with increased migration, chemoresistance, tumor initiation capacity/growth, and metastatic potential. In a cohort of 27 prostate cancer patients with biopsies from primary tumors and distant metastases, CRMP2A expression decreases in the metastatic versus primary tumors. CRMP2A is an endogenous molecular brake on cancer EMT/stemness and its loss increases the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of tumors.

Abstract: Objective
Pancreatic cancer (PC) has the worst prognosis of all common cancers worldwide. This study was intended to investigate the role of ubiquitin specific peptidase 22 (USP22) in cisplatin sensitivity of PC cells and its regulatory mechanism.
Methods
The expression of USP22 and the toxicity of cisplatin to PC cells were detected. The two cell lines AsPC-1 and CAPAN-1 with the most differential drug resistance were selected. By down-expressing USP22 in CAPAN-1 cells and over-expressing USP22 in AsPC-1 cells, the survival rate of PC cells treated with cisplatin was detected. The mRNA expressions of stem cell markers, cell stemness, migration ability and apoptosis of PC cells were detected. The expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway related proteins was detected. The role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PC cell stemness and cisplatin sensitivity was explored after adding the inhibitor HLY78 and activator DKK1.
Results
USP22 was highly-expressed in PC cells, and the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin was negatively-correlated with USP22 expression. Downregulation of USP22 raised the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin, reduced the levels of stem cell markers, reduced the tumor sphere formation and migration, and promoted apoptosis. Silencing USP22 inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Inhibition of USP22 reduced the cell stemness and augmented the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Conclusion
Silencing USP22 can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to reduce cell stemness and enhance the sensitivity of PC cells to cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
Major depressive disorder is a complex disease resulting from aberrant synaptic plasticity that may be caused by abnormal serotonergic signaling. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and imaging methods, we analyze 5-HT7R/MMP-9 signaling and dendritic spine plasticity in the hippocampus in mice treated with the selective 5-HT7R agonist (LP-211) and in a model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We show that acute 5-HT7R activation induces depressive-like behavior in mice in an MMP-9-dependent manner and that post mortem brain samples from human individuals with depression reveal increased MMP-9 enzymatic activity in the hippocampus. Both pharmacological activation of 5-HT7R and modulation of its downstream effectors as a result of CUS lead to dendritic spine elongation and decreased spine density in this region. Overall, the 5-HT7R/MMP-9 pathway is specifically activated in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus during chronic stress and is crucial for inducing depressive-like behavior.

Abstract: Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) is a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. A general Ncoa6 knockout mouse was previously shown to be embryonic lethal, but we here generated liver-specific Ncoa6 knockout (Ncoa6 LKO) mice to investigate the metabolic function of NCOA6 in the liver. These Ncoa6 LKO mice exhibited similar blood glucose and insulin levels to wild type but showed improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and pyruvate tolerance. The decrease in glucose production from pyruvate in these LKO mice was consistent with the abrogation of the fasting-stimulated induction of gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc). The forskolin-stimulated inductions of Pck1 and G6pc were also dramatically reduced in primary hepatocytes isolated from Ncoa6 LKO mice, whereas the expression levels of other gluconeogenic gene regulators, including cAMP response element binding protein (Creb), forkhead box protein O1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, were unaltered in the LKO mouse livers. CREB phosphorylation via fasting or forskolin stimulation was normal in the livers and primary hepatocytes of the LKO mice. Notably, it was observed that CREB interacts with NCOA6. The transcriptional activity of CREB was found to be enhanced by NCOA6 in the context of Pck1 and G6pc promoters. NCOA6-dependent augmentation was abolished in cAMP response element (CRE) mutant promoters of the Pck1 and G6pc genes. Our present results suggest that NCOA6 regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by modulating glucagon/cAMP-dependent gluconeogenic gene transcription through an interaction with CREB.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian genome has a complex, functional 3D organization. However, it remains largely unknown how DNA contacts are orchestrated by chromatin organizers. Here, we infer from only Hi-C the cell-type-specific arrangement of DNA binding sites sufficient to recapitulate, through polymer physics, contact patterns genome wide. Our model is validated by its predictions in a set of duplications at Sox9 against available independent data. The binding site types fall in classes that well match chromatin states from segmentation studies, yet they have an overlapping, combinatorial organization along chromosomes necessary to accurately explain contact specificity. The chromatin signatures of the binding site types return a code linking chromatin states to 3D architecture. The code is validated by extensive de novo predictions of Hi-C maps in an independent set of chromosomes. Overall, our results shed light on how 3D information is encrypted in 1D chromatin via the specific combinatorial arrangement of binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common yet aggressive types of B cell lymphoma and remains incurable in 40% of patients. Herein, we profile the transcriptomes of 94,324 cells from 17 DLBCLs and 3 control samples using single-cell RNA sequencing. Altogether, 73 gene expression programs are identified in malignant cells, demonstrating high intra- and intertumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, 2,754 pairs of suggestive cell-cell interactions are predicted, indicating a complex and highly dynamic tumor microenvironment. Especially for B cell lymphomas, a strong costimulatory CD70-CD27 interaction is predicted between malignant and T cells. Furthermore, coinhibitory signals mediated by TIM3 or TIGIT seem to be the main driving force for T cell exhaustion. Finally, we find that chronic hepatitis B virus infection may have a significant impact on tumor cell survival and immune evasion in DLBCL. Our results provide insights into B cell lymphomagenesis and may facilitate the design of targeted immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that contribute to host defense against virus infections. NK cells respond to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro and are activated in patients with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, by which mechanisms NK cells detect SARS-CoV-2-infected cells remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the Non-structural protein 13 of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a peptide that is presented by human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E). In contrast with self-peptides, the viral peptide prevents binding of HLA-E to the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, thereby rendering target cells susceptible to NK cell attack. In line with these observations, NKG2A-expressing NK cells are particularly activated in patients with COVID-19 and proficiently limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected lung epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, these data suggest that a viral peptide presented by HLA-E abrogates inhibition of NKG2A+ NK cells, resulting in missing self-recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Brain and spinal cord oligodendroglia have distinct functional characteristics, and cell-autonomous loss of individual genes can result in different regional phenotypes. However, a molecular basis for these distinctions is unknown. Using single-cell analysis of oligodendroglia during developmental myelination, we demonstrate that brain and spinal cord precursors are transcriptionally distinct, defined predominantly by cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major regulator promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendroglia. Oligodendroglia-specific loss of mTOR decreases cholesterol biosynthesis in both the brain and the spinal cord, but mTOR loss in spinal cord oligodendroglia has a greater impact on cholesterol biosynthesis, consistent with more pronounced deficits in developmental myelination. In the brain, mTOR loss results in a later adult myelin deficit, including oligodendrocyte death, spontaneous demyelination, and impaired axonal function, demonstrating that mTOR is required for myelin maintenance in the adult brain.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin (IL)-10 is considered a prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine, significantly contributing to the maintenance and reestablishment of immune homeostasis. Accordingly, it has been shown in the intestine that IL-10 produced by Tregs can act on effector T cells, thereby limiting inflammation. Herein, we investigate whether this role also applies to IL-10 produced by T cells during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. During neuroinflammation, both CNS-resident and -infiltrating cells produce IL-10; yet, as IL-10 has a pleotropic function, the exact contribution of the different cellular sources is not fully understood. We find that T-cell-derived IL-10, but not other relevant IL-10 sources, can promote inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, in the CNS, T-cell-derived IL-10 acts on effector T cells, promoting their survival and thereby enhancing inflammation and CNS autoimmunity. Our data indicate a pro-inflammatory role of T-cell-derived IL-10 in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
7SK is a conserved noncoding RNA that regulates transcription by sequestering the transcription factor P-TEFb. 7SK function entails complex changes in RNA structure, but characterizing RNA dynamics in cells remains an unsolved challenge. We developed a single-molecule chemical probing strategy, DANCE-MaP (deconvolution and annotation of ribonucleic conformational ensembles), that defines per-nucleotide reactivity, direct base pairing interactions, tertiary interactions, and thermodynamic populations for each state in RNA structural ensembles from a single experiment. DANCE-MaP reveals that 7SK RNA encodes a large-scale structural switch that couples dissolution of the P-TEFb binding site to structural remodeling at distal release factor binding sites. The 7SK structural equilibrium shifts in response to cell growth and stress and can be targeted to modulate expression of P-TEFbresponsive genes. Our study reveals that RNA structural dynamics underlie 7SK function as an integrator of diverse cellular signals to control transcription and establishes the power of DANCE-MaP to define RNA dynamics in cells.

Abstract: Summary
In pluripotent cells, a delicate activation-repression balance maintains pro-differentiation genes ready for rapid activation. The identity of transcription factors (TFs) that specifically repress pro-differentiation genes remains obscure. By targeting ∼1,700 TFs with CRISPR loss-of-function screen, we found that ZBTB11 and ZFP131 are required for embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency. ESCs without ZBTB11 or ZFP131 lose colony morphology, reduce proliferation rate, and upregulate transcription of genes associated with three germ layers. ZBTB11 and ZFP131 bind proximally to pro-differentiation genes. ZBTB11 or ZFP131 loss leads to an increase in H3K4me3, negative elongation factor (NELF) complex release, and concomitant transcription at associated genes. Together, our results suggest that ZBTB11 and ZFP131 maintain pluripotency by preventing premature expression of pro-differentiation genes and present a generalizable framework to maintain cellular potency.

Abstract: Summary
Older individuals are at increased risk of developing severe respiratory infections. However, our understanding of the impact of aging on the respiratory tract remains limited as samples from healthy humans are challenging to obtain and results can be confounded by variables such as smoking and diet. Here, we carry out a comprehensive cross-sectional study (n = 34 adult, n = 49 aged) to define the consequences of aging on the lung using the rhesus macaque model. Pulmonary function testing establishes similar age and sex differences as humans. Additionally, we report increased abundance of alveolar and infiltrating macrophages and a concomitant decrease in T cells were in aged animals. scRNAseq reveals shifts from GRZMB to IFN expressing CD8+ T cells in the lungs. These data provide insight into age-related changes in the lungs’ functional, microbial, and immunological landscape that explain increased prevalence and severity of respiratory diseases in the elderly.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas biology and technologies have been largely shaped to date by the characterization and use of single-effector nucleases. By contrast, multi-subunit effectors dominate natural systems, represent emerging technologies, and were recently associated with RNA-guided DNA transposition. This disconnect stems from the challenge of working with multiple protein subunits in vitro and in vivo. Here, we apply cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) systems to radically accelerate the characterization of multi-subunit CRISPR effectors and transposons. Numerous DNA constructs can be combined in one TXTL reaction, yielding defined biomolecular readouts in hours. Using TXTL, we mined phylogenetically diverse I-E effectors, interrogated extensively self-targeting I-C and I-F systems, and elucidated targeting rules for I-B and I-F CRISPR transposons using only DNA-binding components. We further recapitulated DNA transposition in TXTL, which helped reveal a distinct branch of I-B CRISPR transposons. These capabilities will facilitate the study and exploitation of the broad yet underexplored diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems and transposons.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are crucial cell populations involved in tumor immune escape, and their functions are regulated by multiple epigenetic mechanisms. The precise regulation mode of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in controlling TIM function is still poorly understood. Our study revealed that the increased expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in TIMs was correlated with the poor prognosis of colon cancer patients, and myeloid deficiency of METTL3 attenuated tumor growth in mice. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on Jak1 mRNA in TIMs, the m6A-YTHDF1 axis enhanced JAK1 protein translation efficiency and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3. Lactate accumulated in tumor microenvironment potently induced METTL3 upregulation in TIMs via H3K18 lactylation. Interestingly, we identified two lactylation modification sites in the zinc-finger domain of METTL3, which was essential for METTL3 to capture target RNA. Our results emphasize the importance of lactylation-driven METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification for promoting the immunosuppressive capacity of TIMs.

Abstract: Summary
Subsets of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are heterogeneous in development and function and play differential roles in intestinal immunity. Histone modifications are involved in the fate commitment of immune cells, including ILC3s. Here, we report that deletion of Setd2, histone H3K36 methyltransferase, in ILC3s results in increased generation of NKp46+ILC3s with enhanced cytotoxic signatures and tumor-suppressive capacity. Meanwhile, Rag1–/–RorcCreSetd2flox/flox mice have fewer CCR6+ILC3s and less defective solitary intestinal lymphoid tissue formation, accompanied by reduced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production by NKp46–ILC3s and decreased CD11b+CD103+ dendritic cell accumulation. The deficiency of Setd2–/–NKp46–ILC3s may contribute to disturbed RORγt+Treg homeostasis and intestinal inflammation in Rag1–/–RorcCreSetd2flox/flox mice upon T cell reconstitution. Setd2 regulates genome accessibility imprinting gene mRNA expression, with a more profound effect on NKp46+ILC3s than NKp46–ILC3s. Therefore, Setd2 determines distinct chromatin status and transcriptomic programs of ILC3 subsets to affect their function and intestinal immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of sensory hair cells (HCs) in the mammalian inner ear leads to permanent hearing and vestibular defects, whereas loss of HCs in zebrafish results in their regeneration. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptional dynamics of HC regeneration in zebrafish at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We uncovered three sequentially activated modules: first, an injury/inflammatory response and downregulation of progenitor cell maintenance genes within minutes after HC loss; second, the transient activation of regeneration-specific genes; and third, a robust re-activation of developmental gene programs, including HC specification, cell-cycle activation, ribosome biogenesis, and a metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation. The results are relevant not only for our understanding of HC regeneration and how we might be able to trigger it in mammals but also for regenerative processes in general. The data are searchable and publicly accessible via a web-based interface.

Abstract: Calorie restriction (CR) and the activation of autophagy extend healthspan by delaying the onset of age-associated diseases in most living organisms. Because protein kinase CK2 (CK2) downregulation induces cellular senescence and nematode aging, we investigated CK2’s role in CR and autophagy. This study indicated that CR upregulated CK2’s expression, thereby causing SIRT1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. CK2α overexpression, including antisense inhibitors of miR-186, miR-216b, miR-337-3p, and miR-760, stimulated autophagy initiation and nucleation markers (increase in ATG5, ATG7, LC3BII, beclin-1, and Ulk1, and decrease in SQSTM1/p62). The SIRT1 deacetylase, AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMPK, and forkhead homeobox type O (FoxO) 3a were involved in CK2-mediated autophagy. The treatment with the AKT inhibitor triciribine, the AMPK activator AICAR, or the SIRT1 activator resveratrol rescued a reduction in the expression of lgg-1 (the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of LC3B), bec-1 (the C. elegans ortholog of beclin-1), and unc-51 (the C. elegans ortholog of Ulk1), mediated by kin-10 (the C. elegans ortholog of CK2β) knockdown in nematodes. Thus, this study indicated that CK2 acted as a positive regulator in CR and autophagy, thereby suggesting that these four miRs’ antisense inhibitors can be used as CR mimetics or autophagy inducers.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global pathogen. We report here that the cellular CRM1 machinery can mediate nuclear export of entire HBV core (HBc) particles containing encapsidated viral RNAs. Two CRM1-mediated nuclear export signals (NESCRM1) cluster at the conformationally flexible spike tips of HBc particles. Mutant NESCRM1 capsids exhibit strongly reduced associations with CRM1 and nucleoporin358 in vivo. CRM1 and NXF1 machineries mediate nuclear export of HBc particles independently. Inhibition of nuclear export has pleiotropic consequences, including nuclear accumulation of HBc particles, a significant reduction of encapsidated viral RNAs in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus, and barely detectable viral DNA. We hypothesize an HBV life cycle where encapsidation of the RNA pregenome can initiate early in the nucleus, whereas DNA genome maturation occurs mainly in the cytoplasm. We identified a druggable target for HBV by blocking its intracellular trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
The visual system processes sensory inputs sequentially, perceiving coarse information before fine details. Here we study the neural basis of coarse-to-fine processing and its computational benefits in natural vision. We find that primary visual cortical neurons in awake mice respond to natural scenes in a coarse-to-fine manner, primarily driven by individual neurons rapidly shifting their spatial frequency preference from low to high over a brief response period. This shift transforms the population response in a way that counteracts the statistical regularities of natural scenes, thereby reducing redundancy and generating a more efficient neural representation. The increase in representational efficiency does not occur in either dark-reared or anesthetized mice, which show significantly attenuated coarse-to-fine spatial processing. Collectively, these results illustrate that coarse-to-fine processing is state dependent, develops postnatally via visual experience, and provides a computational advantage by generating more efficient representations of the complex spatial statistics of ethologically relevant natural scenes.

Abstract: Aim
PRMT5 and c-Myc were considered as oncogene of bladder cancer. Nevertheless, whether the interaction between of PRMT5 and c-Myc affect bladder cancer progress is unknown. Herein, we explore the above points and discuss deeply its’ potential mechanism.
Method
5637 and T24 cells were study subjects in vitro. Western blot was used to examined the protein expression. CCK8 and transwell assay were used to analyze proliferation and invasion ability. Additionally, xenograft tumor model was established. Mice imaging experiment, Immunochemistry assay and western blot were carried out.
Result
Western blot result showed successful transfection of PRMT5-siRNA and c-Myc-siRNA. PRMT5-siRNA could inhibit c-Myc expression, and decrease the proliferation and invasion of bladder cells. And c-Myc overexpression could reverse inhibitory action caused by PRMT5 silence. And in vitro studies found low-expression of c-Myc reduced proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and make the NF-κB pathway inactivation. In vivo studies also demonstrated that inhibiting PRMT5 could downregulate c-Myc expression and inhibit the bladder cancer progress, and the potential mechanism was likely to be related to NF-κB signaling pathway.
Conclusion
In a word, low-expression of PRMT5 suppressed c-Myc, and thus inhibited proliferation and invasion ability of 5637 and T24 cells through NF-κB pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymatic methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine in DNA is a fundamental epigenetic mechanism involved in mammalian development and disease. DNA methylation is brought about by collective action of three AdoMet-dependent DNA methyltransferases, whose catalytic interactions and temporal interplay are poorly understood. We used structure-guided engineering of the Dnmt1 methyltransferase to enable catalytic transfer of azide tags onto DNA from a synthetic cofactor analog, Ado-6-azide, in vitro. We then CRISPR-edited the Dnmt1 locus in mouse embryonic stem cells to install the engineered codon, which, following pulse internalization of the Ado-6-azide cofactor by electroporation, permitted selective azide tagging of Dnmt1-specific genomic targets in cellulo. The deposited covalent tags were exploited as “click” handles for reading adjoining sequences and precise genomic mapping of the methylation sites. The proposed approach, Dnmt-TOP-seq, enables high-resolution temporal tracking of the Dnmt1 catalysis in mammalian cells, paving the way to selective studies of other methylation pathways in eukaryotic systems.

Abstract: Summary
Protein fatty acylation regulates numerous cell signaling pathways. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert a plethora of physiological effects, including cell signaling regulation, with underlying mechanisms to be fully understood. Herein, we report that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) regulate PI3K-AKT signaling by modifying PDK1 and AKT2. DHA-administered mice exhibit altered phosphorylation of proteins in signaling pathways. Methylene bridge-containing DHA/EPA acylate δ1 carbon of tryptophan 448/543 in PDK1 and tryptophan 414 in AKT2 via free radical pathway, recruit both the proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane, and activate PI3K signaling and glucose uptake in a tryptophan acylation-dependent but insulin-independent manner in cultured cells and in mice. DHA/EPA deplete cytosolic PDK1 and AKT2 and induce insulin resistance. Akt2 knockout in mice abrogates DHA/EPA-induced PI3K-AKT signaling. Our results identify PUFA’s methylene bridge tryptophan acylation, a protein fatty acylation that regulates cell signaling and may underlie multifaceted effects of methylene-bridge-containing PUFAs.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests that impaired synaptic and firing homeostasis represents a driving force of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Here, we examine synaptic and sleep homeostasis in a Drosophila model by overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose duplication and mutations cause familial early-onset AD. We find that APP overexpression induces synaptic hyperexcitability. RNA-seq data indicate exaggerated expression of Ca2+-related signaling genes in APP mutants, including genes encoding Dmca1D, calcineurin (CaN) complex, and IP3R. We further demonstrate that increased CaN activity triggers transcriptional activation of Itpr (IP3R) through activating nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Strikingly, APP overexpression causes defects in synaptic downscaling and sleep deprivation-induced sleep rebound, and both defects could be restored by inhibiting IP3R. Our findings uncover IP3R as a shared signaling molecule in synaptic downscaling and sleep homeostasis, and its dysregulation may lead to synaptic hyperexcitability and AD progression at early stage.

Abstract: Summary
Real-time in vivo imaging provides an essential window into the spatiotemporal cellular events contributing to tissue development and pathology. By coupling longitudinal intravital imaging with genetic lineage tracing, here we capture the earliest cellular events arising in response to active Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the ensuing impact on the organization and differentiation of the mammary epithelium. This enables us to interrogate how Wnt/β-catenin regulates the dynamics of distinct subpopulations of mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in real time. We show that β-catenin stabilization, when targeted to either the mammary luminal or basal epithelial lineage, leads to cellular rearrangements that precipitate the formation of hyperplastic lesions that undergo squamous transdifferentiation. These results enhance our understanding of the earliest stages of hyperplastic lesion formation in vivo and reveal that, in mammary neoplastic development, β-catenin activation dictates a hair follicle/epidermal differentiation program independently of the targeted cell of origin.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome inheritance depends on centromeres, epigenetically specified regions of chromosomes. While conventional human centromeres are known to be built of long tandem DNA repeats, much of their architecture remains unknown. Using single-molecule techniques such as AFM, nanopores, and optical tweezers, we find that human centromeric DNA exhibits complex DNA folds such as local hairpins. Upon binding to a specific sequence within centromeric regions, the DNA-binding protein CENP-B compacts centromeres by forming pronounced DNA loops between the repeats, which favor inter-chromosomal centromere compaction and clustering. This DNA-loop-mediated organization of centromeric chromatin participates in maintaining centromere position and integrity upon microtubule pulling during mitosis. Our findings emphasize the importance of DNA topology in centromeric regulation and stability.

Abstract: Summary
Progression through G1/S phase of the cell cycle is coordinated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activities. Here, we find that the requirement for different CDK activities and cyclins in driving cancer cell cycles is highly heterogeneous. The differential gene requirements associate with tumor origin and genetic alterations. We define multiple mechanisms for G1/S progression in RB-proficient models, which are CDK4/6 independent and elicit resistance to FDA-approved inhibitors. Conversely, RB-deficient models are intrinsically CDK4/6 independent, but exhibit differential requirements for cyclin E. These dependencies for CDK and cyclins associate with gene expression programs that denote intrinsically different cell-cycle states. Mining therapeutic sensitivities shows that there are reciprocal vulnerabilities associated with RB1 or CCND1 expression versus CCNE1 or CDKN2A. Together, these findings illustrate the complex nature of cancer cell cycles and the relevance for precision therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Persisters constitute a population of temporarily antibiotic-tolerant variants in an isogenic bacterial population and are considered an important cause of relapsing infections. It is currently unclear how cellular damage inflicted by antibiotic action is reversed upon persister state exit and how this relates to antibiotic resistance development at the molecular level. We demonstrate that persisters, upon fluoroquinolone treatment, accumulate oxidative DNA damage, which is repaired through nucleotide excision repair. Detection of the damage occurs via transcription-coupled repair using UvrD-mediated backtracking or Mfd-controlled displacement of the RNA polymerase. This competition results in heterogeneity in persister awakening lags. Most persisters repair the oxidative DNA damage, displaying a mutation rate equal to the untreated population. However, the promutagenic factor Mfd increases the mutation rate in a persister subpopulation. Our data provide in-depth insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying persister survival and pinpoint Mfd as an important molecular factor linking persistence to resistance development.

Abstract: Summary
Microvilli are conserved actin-based surface protrusions that have been repurposed throughout evolution to fulfill diverse cell functions. In the case of transporting epithelia, microvilli are supported by a core of actin filaments bundled in parallel by villin, fimbrin, and espin. Remarkably, microvilli biogenesis persists in mice lacking all three of these factors, suggesting the existence of unknown bundlers. We identified Mitotic Spindle Positioning (MISP) as an actin-binding factor that localizes specifically to the rootlet end of the microvillus. MISP promotes rootlet elongation in cells, and purified MISP exhibits potent filament bundling activity in vitro. MISP-bundled filaments also recruit fimbrin, which further elongates and stabilizes bundles. MISP confinement to the rootlet is enforced by ezrin, which prevents decoration of the membrane-wrapped distal end of the core bundle. These discoveries reveal how epithelial cells optimize apical membrane surface area and offer insight on the remarkable robustness of microvilli biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical wiring relies on guidepost cells and activity-dependent processes that are thought to act sequentially. Here, we show that the construction of layer 1 (L1), a main site of top-down integration, is regulated by crosstalk between transient Cajal-Retzius cells (CRc) and spontaneous activity of the thalamus, a main driver of bottom-up information. While activity was known to regulate CRc migration and elimination, we found that prenatal spontaneous thalamic activity and NMDA receptors selectively control CRc early density, without affecting their demise. CRc density, in turn, regulates the distribution of upper layer interneurons and excitatory synapses, thereby drastically impairing the apical dendrite activity of output pyramidal neurons. In contrast, postnatal sensory-evoked activity had a limited impact on L1 and selectively perturbed basal dendrites synaptogenesis. Collectively, our study highlights a remarkable interplay between thalamic activity and CRc in L1 functional wiring, with major implications for our understanding of cortical development.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroplasts are the site of numerous biochemical reactions including photosynthesis, but they also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that negatively affect chloroplast integrity. The chaperone-like CDC48 complex plays critical roles in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in yeast and mammals, but its function in plants is largely unknown. Here, we show that defects in CDC48A and its cofactors UFD1 and NPL4 lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated chloroplast proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. We reveal that two plastid genome-encoded proteins, RbcL and AtpB, associate with the CDC48 complex. Strikingly, RbcL and AtpB are ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome pathway upon ROS stress, and these processes are impaired by defects of the CDC48 complex. Functional analysis demonstrates that the CDC48 complex is required for plant tolerance to ROS. This study reveals a role for the plant CDC48 complex in modulating ubiquitin-dependent degradation of intra-chloroplast proteins in response to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Purpose
The treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration is limited, cyanidin can protect chondrocytes from degeneration. This research investigated the effect of cyanidin on human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPC) metabolism and its mechanism.
Methods
HNPC were treated with cyanidin, XAV-939 (inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) and SKL2001 (activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling), and pressurized at 1, 3, and 30 atm. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to assess the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Collagen-II, Aggrecan, Wnt-3a and β-catenin in treated HNPC. Cell counting kit-8 was used to detect the HNPC cell viability. Radioisotope incorporation method was used to assess the proteoglycan synthesis rate of HNPC. The level of cell matrix was detected by toluidine blue staining.
Results
Proper hydrostatic pressure of 3 atm could elevate cell viability, proteoglycan synthesis and the level of cell matrix of HNPC, while high hydrostatic pressure of 30 atm reduced the above effects. Cyanidin and XAV-939 reversed the promoting effect of 30 atm pressure on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the inhibiting effect on cell viability, proteoglycan synthesis and the level of cell matrix. Subsequently, SKL2001 further reversed the function of cyanidin on HNPC.
Conclusion
Cyanidin attenuated the high hydrostatic pressure-induced degradation of cellular matrix of HNPC via blocking the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings in this research provided a basis for in vitro experiment of cyanidin and a theoretical fundament on this disease.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-based immunotherapy for cancer and immunological diseases has made great strides, but it still faces multiple hurdles. Finding the right molecular targets to engineer T cells toward a desired function has broad implications for the armamentarium of T cell-centered therapies. Here, we developed a dead-guide RNA (dgRNA)-based CRISPR activation screen in primary CD8+ T cells and identified gain-of-function (GOF) targets for CAR-T engineering. Targeted knockin or overexpression of a lead target, PRODH2, enhanced CAR-T-based killing and in vivo efficacy in multiple cancer models. Transcriptomics and metabolomics in CAR-T cells revealed that augmenting PRODH2 expression reshaped broad and distinct gene expression and metabolic programs. Mitochondrial, metabolic, and immunological analyses showed that PRODH2 engineering enhances the metabolic and immune functions of CAR-T cells against cancer. Together, these findings provide a system for identification of GOF immune boosters and demonstrate PRODH2 as a target to enhance CAR-T efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
While the existence of an indigenous placental microbiota remains controversial, several pathogens are known to be involved in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral bacterium that is one of several bacteria associated with preterm birth. Oral fusobacteria translocate to the placenta hematogenously; however, the mechanisms localizing them to the placenta remain unclear. Here, using peanut agglutinin, we demonstrate that the level of Gal-GalNAc (Galβ1−3GalNAc; Thomsen Friedenreich antigen) found on trophoblasts facing entering maternal blood rises during gestation and is recognized by the fusobacterial Fap2 Gal-GalNAc lectin. F. nucleatum binding to human and mouse placenta correlates with Gal-GalNAc levels and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment or with soluble Gal-GalNAc. Fap2-inactivated F. nucleatum shows reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-displaying placental sections. In a mouse model, intravenously injected Fap2-expressing F. nucleatum, but not a Fap2 mutant, reduces mouse fetal survival by 70%.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons must function for decades of life, but how these non-dividing cells are preserved is poorly understood. Using mouse serotonin (5-HT) neurons as a model, we report an adult-stage transcriptional program specialized to ensure the preservation of neuronal connectivity. We uncover a switch in Lmx1b and Pet1 transcription factor function from controlling embryonic axonal growth to sustaining a transcriptomic signature of 5-HT connectivity comprising functionally diverse synaptic and axonal genes. Adult-stage deficiency of Lmx1b and Pet1 causes slowly progressing degeneration of 5-HT synapses and axons, increased susceptibility of 5-HT axons to neurotoxic injury, and abnormal stress responses. Axon degeneration occurs in a die back pattern and is accompanied by accumulation of α-synuclein and amyloid precursor protein in spheroids and mitochondrial fragmentation without cell body loss. Our findings suggest that neuronal connectivity is transcriptionally protected by maintenance of connectivity transcriptomes; progressive decay of such transcriptomes may contribute to age-related diseases of brain circuitry.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is generating remarkable responses in individuals with cancer, but only a small portion of individuals with breast cancer respond well. Here we report that tumor-derived Jagged1 is a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment. Jagged1 promotes tumorigenesis in multiple spontaneous mammary tumor models. Through Jagged1-induced Notch activation, tumor cells increase expression and secretion of multiple cytokines to help recruit macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. Educated macrophages crosstalk with tumor-infiltrating T cells to inhibit T cell proliferation and tumoricidal activity. In individuals with triple-negative breast cancer, a high expression level of Jagged1 correlates with increased macrophage infiltration and decreased T cell activity. Co-administration of an ICI PD-1 antibody with a Notch inhibitor significantly inhibits tumor growth in breast cancer models. Our findings establish a distinct signaling cascade by which Jagged1 promotes adaptive immune evasion of tumor cells and provide several possible therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge about the impact of prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of the elderly on mRNA vaccination response is needed to appropriately address the demand for additional vaccinations in this vulnerable population. Here, we show that octogenarians, a high-risk population, mount a sustained SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response for 15 months following infection. This response boosts antibody levels 35-fold upon receiving a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In contrast, antibody responses in naive individuals boost only 6-fold after a second vaccine. Spike-specific angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) antibody binding responses in the previously infected octogenarians following two vaccine doses exceed those found in a naive cohort after two doses. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) demonstrates activation of interferon-induced genetic programs, which persist only in the previously infected. A preferential increase of specific immunoglobulin G heavy chain variable (IGHV) clonal transcripts that are the basis of neutralizing antibodies is observed only in the previously infected nuns.

Abstract: Summary
The histone chaperone complex FACT comprises SPT16 and SSRP1 and contributes to DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but how it plays such various roles is unclear. Here, we show that human SPT16 is ubiquitylated at lysine-674 (K674) by the DCAF14-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. K674 is located in the middle domain of SPT16, and the corresponding residue of the yeast ortholog is critical for binding to histone H3.1-H4. We show that the middle domain of human SPT16 binds to histone H3.1-H4 and that this binding is inhibited by K674 ubiquitylation. Cells with heterozygous knockin of a K674R mutant of SPT16 manifest reduction of both SPT16 ubiquitylation and H3.1 in chromatin, a reduced population in mid S phase, impaired proliferation, and increased susceptibility to S phase stress. Our data thus indicate that SPT16 ubiquitylation by DCAF14-CRL4 regulates FACT binding to histones and may thereby control DNA replication-coupled histone incorporation into chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
Complex somatic genomic rearrangements and copy number alterations are hallmarks of nearly all cancers. We have developed an algorithm, LINX, to aid interpretation of structural variant and copy number data derived from short-read, whole-genome sequencing. LINX classifies raw structural variant calls into distinct events and predicts their effect on the local structure of the derivative chromosome and the functional impact on affected genes. Visualizations facilitate further investigation of complex rearrangements. LINX allows insights into a diverse range of structural variation events and can reliably detect pathogenic rearrangements, including gene fusions, immunoglobulin enhancer rearrangements, intragenic deletions, and duplications. Uniquely, LINX also predicts chained fusions that we demonstrate account for 13% of clinically relevant oncogenic fusions. LINX also reports a class of inactivation events that we term homozygous disruptions that may be a driver mutation in up to 9% of tumors and may frequently affect PTEN, TP53, and RB1.

Abstract: Summary
The response to oxygen availability is a fundamental process concerning metabolism and survival/death in all mitochondria-containing eukaryotes. However, the known oxygen-sensing mechanism in mammalian cells depends on pVHL, which is only found among metazoans but not in other species. Here, we present an alternative oxygen-sensing pathway regulated by ATE1, an enzyme ubiquitously conserved in eukaryotes that influences protein degradation by posttranslational arginylation. We report that ATE1 centrally controls the hypoxic response and glycolysis in mammalian cells by preferentially arginylating HIF1α that is hydroxylated by PHD in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, the degradation of arginylated HIF1α is independent of pVHL E3 ubiquitin ligase but dependent on the UBR family proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of human tumor data reveals that the ATE1/UBR and pVHL pathways jointly regulate oxygen sensing in a transcription-independent manner with different tissue specificities. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that eukaryotic ATE1 likely evolved during mitochondrial domestication, much earlier than pVHL.

Abstract: Summary
Invasive cells use transient, energy-consuming protrusions to breach basement membrane (BM) barriers. Using the ATP sensor PercevalHR during anchor cell (AC) invasion in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that BM invasion is accompanied by an ATP burst from mitochondria at the invasive front. RNAi screening and visualization of a glucose biosensor identified two glucose transporters, FGT-1 and FGT-2, which bathe invasive front mitochondria with glucose and facilitate the ATP burst to form protrusions. FGT-1 localizes at high levels along the invasive membrane, while FGT-2 is adaptive, enriching most strongly during BM breaching and when FGT-1 is absent. Cytosolic glycolytic enzymes that process glucose for mitochondrial ATP production cluster with invasive front mitochondria and promote higher mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Finally, we show that UNC-6 (netrin), which polarizes invasive protrusions, also orients FGT-1. These studies reveal a robust and integrated energy acquisition, processing, and delivery network that powers BM breaching.

Abstract: Independent of its function as a subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the Cavβ3 subunit desensitizes fibroblasts and pancreatic β-cells to low concentrations of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). This alters agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling and cellular functions, for example, insulin secretion and wound healing. A total of four Cavβ subunits exist, Cavβ1, Cavβ2, Cavβ3, and Cavβ4. To investigate whether the other Cavβ subunits, like Cavβ3, can desensitize cells to IP3 and thereby modulate Ca2+ signaling, we expressed the cDNAs of Cavβ1, Cavβ2, Cavβ3, and Cavβ4 in COS-7 cells lacking endogenous Cavβ proteins. ATP stimulation of these cells results in the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This receptor-mediated Ca2+ release is significantly decreased by Cavβ3 but not by Cavβ1, Cavβ2, and Cavβ4. Electrophysiological recordings of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents from fibroblasts show a small Ca2+ current, the amplitude of which is slightly but not significantly smaller in fibroblasts from Cavβ2 gene-deficient animals than in fibroblasts from wild-type animals. Compared with fibroblasts from wild-type animals, Ca2+ release is not significantly increased in Cavβ2-deficient fibroblasts, in contrast to Ca2+ release in Cavβ3-deficient fibroblasts. In summary, our results show that desensitization of cells to low concentrations of IP3 is a specific property of Cavβ3 that is not shared by other Cavβ subunits.

Abstract: Summary
During embryogenesis, the initial vascular network forms by the process of vasculogenesis, or the specification of vascular progenitors de novo. In contrast, the majority of later-forming vessels arise by angiogenesis from the already established vasculature. Here, we show that new vascular progenitors in zebrafish embryos emerge from a distinct site along the yolk extension, or secondary vascular field (SVF), incorporate into the posterior cardinal vein, and contribute to subintestinal vasculature even after blood circulation has been initiated. We further demonstrate that SVF cells participate in vascular recovery after chemical ablation of vascular endothelial cells. Inducible inhibition of the function of vascular progenitor marker etv2/etsrp prevented SVF cell differentiation and resulted in the defective formation of subintestinal vasculature. Similar late-forming etv2+ progenitors were also observed in mouse embryos, suggesting that SVF cells are evolutionarily conserved. Our results characterize a distinct mechanism by which new vascular progenitors incorporate into established vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy has achieved limited success in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Commensal microbiota have been proven to colonize the mammary gland, but whether and how they modulate the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. We performed a multiomics analysis of a cohort of patients with TNBC (n = 360) and found genera under Clostridiales, and the related metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was more abundant in tumors with an activated immune microenvironment. Patients with higher plasma TMAO achieved better responses to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, TMAO induced pyroptosis in tumor cells by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase PERK and thus enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in TNBC in vivo. Collectively, our findings offer new insights into microbiota-metabolite-immune crosstalk and indicate that microbial metabolites, such as TMAO or its precursor choline, may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to promote the efficacy of immunotherapy in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential for post-implantation development by depositing repressive histone modifications at promoters, mainly CpG islands (CGIs), of developmental regulator genes. However, promoter PcG marks are erased after fertilization and de novo established in peri-implantation embryos, coinciding with the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for this establishment remains unknown. In this study, we show that the expression of the long KDM2B isoform (KDM2BLF), which contains the demethylase domain, is specifically induced at peri-implantation and that its H3K36me2 demethylase activity is required for PcG enrichment at CGIs. Moreover, KDM2BLF interacts with BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) and stabilizes BAF occupancy at CGIs for subsequent gain of accessibility, which precedes PcG enrichment. Consistently, KDM2BLF inactivation results in significantly delayed post-implantation development. In summary, our data unveil dynamic chromatin configuration of CGIs during exit from naive pluripotency and provide a conceptual framework for the spatiotemporal establishment of PcG functions.

Abstract: Summary
For survival, animals encode prominent events in complex environments, which modulates their defense behavior. Here, we design a paradigm that assesses how a mild aversive cue (i.e., mild air puff) interacts with sound-evoked flight behavior in mice. We find that air puffing facilitates sound-evoked flight behavior by enhancing the auditory responses of auditory cortical neurons. We then find that the anterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes the valence of air puffing and modulates the auditory cortex through anatomical examination, physiological recordings, and optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulations. Activating ACC projections to the auditory cortex simulates the facilitating effect of air puffing, whereas inhibiting the ACC or its projections to the auditory cortex neutralizes this facilitating effect. These findings show that the ACC regulates sound-evoked flight behavior by potentiating neuronal responses in the auditory cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a poor prognosis. We report a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of bone marrow biopsies from 252 uniformly treated AML patients to elucidate the molecular pathophysiology of AML in order to inform future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In addition to in-depth quantitative proteomics, our analysis includes cytogenetic profiling and DNA/RNA sequencing. We identify five proteomic AML subtypes, each reflecting specific biological features spanning genomic boundaries. Two of these proteomic subtypes correlate with patient outcome, but none is exclusively associated with specific genomic aberrations. Remarkably, one subtype (Mito-AML), which is captured only in the proteome, is characterized by high expression of mitochondrial proteins and confers poor outcome, with reduced remission rate and shorter overall survival on treatment with intensive induction chemotherapy. Functional analyses reveal that Mito-AML is metabolically wired toward stronger complex I-dependent respiration and is more responsive to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.

Abstract: Summary
The functional consequence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is mediated by “reader” proteins of the YTH family. YTH domain-containing 2 (YTHDC2) is essential for mammalian fertility, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here, we identify U-rich motifs as binding sites of YTHDC2 on 3′ UTRs of mouse testicular RNA targets. Although its YTH domain is an m6A-binder in vitro, the YTH point mutant mice are fertile. Significantly, the loss of its 3′→5′ RNA helicase activity causes mouse infertility, with the catalytic-dead mutation being dominant negative. Biochemical studies reveal that the weak helicase activity of YTHDC2 is enhanced by its interaction with the 5′→3′ exoribonuclease XRN1. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that Ythdc2 mutant mitotic germ cells transition into meiosis but accumulate a transcriptome with mixed mitotic/meiotic identity that fail to progress further into meiosis. Finally, our demonstration that ythdc2 mutant zebrafish are infertile highlights its conserved role in animal germ cell development.

Abstract: Summary
A polyubiquitin chain can adopt a variety of shapes, depending on how the ubiquitin monomers are joined. However, the relevance of linkage for the signaling functions of polyubiquitin chains is often poorly understood because of our inability to control or manipulate this parameter in vivo. Here, we present a strategy for reprogramming polyubiquitin chain linkage by means of tailor-made, linkage- and substrate-selective ubiquitin ligases. Using the polyubiquitylation of the budding yeast replication factor PCNA in response to DNA damage as a model case, we show that altering the features of a polyubiquitin chain in vivo can change the fate of the modified substrate. We also provide evidence for redundancy between distinct but structurally similar linkages, and we demonstrate by proof-of-principle experiments that the method can be generalized to targets beyond PCNA. Our study illustrates a promising approach toward the in vivo analysis of polyubiquitin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The current model of the mammalian circadian clock describes cell-autonomous and negative feedback-driven circadian oscillation of Cry and Per transcription as the core circadian rhythm generator. However, the actual contribution of this oscillation to circadian rhythm generation remains undefined. Here we perform targeted disruption of cis elements indispensable for cell-autonomous Cry oscillation. Mice lacking overt cell-autonomous Cry oscillation show robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. In addition, tissue-autonomous circadian rhythms are robust in the absence of overt Cry oscillation. Unexpectedly, although the absence of overt Cry oscillation leads to severe attenuation of Per oscillation at the cell-autonomous level, circadian rhythms in Per2 accumulation remain robust. As a mechanism to explain this counterintuitive result, Per2 half-life shows cell-autonomous circadian rhythms independent of Cry and Per oscillation. The cell-autonomous circadian clock may therefore remain partially functional even in the absence of overt Cry and Per oscillation because of circadian oscillation in Per2 degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Bifurcation of cellular fates, a critical process in development, requires histone 3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) marks propagated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). However, precise chromatin loci of functional H3K27me3 marks are not yet known. Here, we identify critical PRC2 functional sites at high resolution. We fused a computationally designed protein, EED binder (EB), which competes with EZH2 and thereby inhibits PRC2 function, to dCas9 (EBdCas9) to allow for PRC2 inhibition at a precise locus using gRNA. Targeting EBdCas9 to four different genes (TBX18, p16, CDX2, and GATA3) results in precise H3K27me3 and EZH2 reduction, gene activation, and functional outcomes in the cell cycle (p16) or trophoblast transdifferentiation (CDX2 and GATA3). In the case of TBX18, we identify a PRC2-controlled, functional TATA box >500 bp upstream of the TBX18 transcription start site (TSS) using EBdCas9. Deletion of this TATA box eliminates EBdCas9-dependent TATA binding protein (TBP) recruitment and transcriptional activation. EBdCas9 technology may provide a broadly applicable tool for epigenomic control of gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
De-etiolation is indispensable for seedling survival and development. However, how sugars regulate de-etiolation and how sugars induce ethylene (ET) for seedlings to grow out of soil remain elusive. Here, we reveal how a sucrose (Suc) feedback loop promotes de-etiolation by inducing ET biosynthesis. Under darkness, Suc in germinating seeds preferentially induces 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS7; encoding a key ET biosynthesis enzyme) and associated ET biosynthesis, thereby activating ET core component ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3). Activated EIN3 directly inhibits the function of Suc transporter 2 (SUC2; a major Suc transporter) to block Suc export from cotyledons and thereby elevate Suc accumulation of cotyledons to induce ET. Under light, ET-activated EIN3 directly inhibits the function of phytochrome A (phyA; a de-etiolation inhibitor) to promote de-etiolation. We therefore propose that under darkness, the Suc feedback loop (Suc-ACS7-EIN3-|SUC2-Suc) promotes Suc accumulation in cotyledons to guarantee ET biosynthesis, facilitate de-etiolation, and enable seedlings to grow out of soil.

Abstract: Cell culture plays a vital role in mechanism research, as a supplement to experiments in vivo. At present, there are two main methods to obtain mouse embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cells, while no systematic investigation about characteristics of cells using these two methods to get a clear application. In this study, using the traditional two-step primary culture method as the control group, we found that the MEPM cells of the simplified one-step method and the control group were both consistent with the surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells. The vimentin (mesenchymal marker) was positive, cytokeratin 14 (CK14, epithelium marker) was negative. In addition, along with the increasing passages, the cells cultured by two methods had similar changes with a decreasing proliferation activity, increasing apoptosis rate, declining migration, diminishing stemness, and obvious senescence. Moreover, the senescence of MEPM cells in the one-step group was lower than that in the control group. Our findings indicate that there are no significant differences between the two methods and one-step method can be a good method in investigating palatal development mechanisms by shortening the processing of the MEPM cell culture and may reduce the damage to the cells done by more enzymes and processing.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell technologies measure unique cellular signatures but are typically limited to a single modality. Computational approaches allow the fusion of diverse single-cell data types, but their efficacy is difficult to validate in the absence of authentic multi-omic measurements. To comprehensively assess the molecular phenotypes of single cells, we devised single-nucleus methylcytosine, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptome sequencing (snmCAT-seq) and applied it to postmortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a cross-validation approach using multi-modal information to validate fine-grained cell types and assessed the effectiveness of computational data fusion methods. Correlation analysis in individual cells revealed distinct relations between methylation and gene expression. Our integrative approach enabled joint analyses of the methylome, transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and conformation for 63 human cortical cell types. We reconstructed regulatory lineages for cortical cell populations and found specific enrichment of genetic risk for neuropsychiatric traits, enabling the prediction of cell types that are associated with diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Organ morphogenesis involves dynamic changes of tissue properties while cells adapt to their mechanical environment through mechanosensitive pathways. How mechanical cues influence cell behaviors during morphogenesis remains unclear. Here, we studied the formation of the zebrafish atrioventricular canal (AVC) where cardiac valves develop. We show that the AVC forms within a zone of tissue convergence associated with the increased activation of the actomyosin meshwork and cell-orientation changes. We demonstrate that tissue convergence occurs with a reduction of cell volume triggered by mechanical forces and the mechanosensitive channel TRPP2/TRPV4. Finally, we show that the extracellular matrix component hyaluronic acid controls cell volume changes. Together, our data suggest that multiple force-sensitive signaling pathways converge to modulate cell volume. We conclude that cell volume reduction is a key cellular feature activated by mechanotransduction during cardiovascular morphogenesis. This work further identifies how mechanical forces and extracellular matrix influence tissue remodeling in developing organs.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes act as intercellular communicators by transferring protein and microRNA cargoes, yet the role of EV lipids remains unclear. Here, we show that the pro-tumorigenic action of lymphoma-derived EVs is augmented via secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)-driven lipid metabolism. Hydrolysis of EV phospholipids by group X sPLA2, which was induced in macrophages of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lymphoma, increased the production of fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and their metabolites. sPLA2-treated EVs were smaller and self-aggregated, showed better uptake, and increased cytokine expression and lipid mediator signaling in tumor-associated macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous sPLA2 suppressed lymphoma growth in EBV-infected humanized mice, while treatment with sPLA2-modified EVs reversed this phenotype. Furthermore, sPLA2 expression in human large B cell lymphomas inversely correlated with patient survival. Overall, the sPLA2-mediated EV modification promotes tumor development, highlighting a non-canonical mechanistic action of EVs as an extracellular hydrolytic platform of sPLA2.

Abstract: Summary
The sense of smell helps us navigate the environment, but its molecular architecture and underlying logic remain understudied. The spatial location of odorant receptor genes (Olfrs) in the nose is thought to be independent of the structural diversity of the odorants they detect. Using spatial transcriptomics, we create a genome-wide 3D atlas of the mouse olfactory mucosa (OM). Topographic maps of genes differentially expressed in space reveal that both Olfrs and non-Olfrs are distributed in a continuous and overlapping fashion over at least five broad zones in the OM. The spatial locations of Olfrs correlate with the mucus solubility of the odorants they recognize, providing direct evidence for the chromatographic theory of olfaction. This resource resolves the molecular architecture of the mouse OM and will inform future studies on mechanisms underlying Olfr gene choice, axonal pathfinding, patterning of the nervous system, and basic logic for the peripheral representation of smell.

Abstract: Summary
Noncanonical genomic imprinting can cause biased expression of one parental allele in a tissue; however, the functional relevance of such biases is unclear. To investigate ethological roles for noncanonical imprinting in dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), we use machine learning to decompose naturalistic foraging in maternal and paternal allele mutant heterozygous mice. We uncover distinct roles for the maternal versus paternal alleles on foraging, where maternal alleles affect sons while daughters are under paternal allelic control. Each parental allele controls specific action sequences reflecting decisions in naive or familiar contexts. The maternal Ddc allele is preferentially expressed in subsets of hypothalamic GABAergic neurons, while the paternal allele predominates in subsets of adrenal cells. Each Ddc allele affects distinct molecular and endocrine components of the brain-adrenal axis. Thus, monoaminergic noncanonical imprinting has ethological roles in foraging and endocrine functions and operates by affecting discrete subsets of cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction is interconnected with cancer. Nevertheless, how defective mitochondria promote cancer is poorly understood. We find that mitochondrial dysfunction promotes DNA damage under conditions of increased apoptotic priming. Underlying this process, we reveal a key role for mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of DNA damage and genome instability. The ability of mitochondrial dynamics to regulate oncogenic DNA damage centers upon the control of minority mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a process that enables non-lethal caspase activation leading to DNA damage. Mitochondrial fusion suppresses minority MOMP and its associated DNA damage by enabling homogeneous mitochondrial expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Finally, we find that mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits pro-apoptotic BAX retrotranslocation, causing BAX mitochondrial localization and thereby promoting minority MOMP. Unexpectedly, these data reveal oncogenic effects of mitochondrial dysfunction that are mediated via mitochondrial dynamics and caspase-dependent DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is a low abundant phospholipid with important roles in lipid transport and membrane trafficking. However, little is known of its metabolism and function in neurons. Here, we investigate its subcellular distribution and functional roles in dendrites of rodent hippocampal neurons during resting state and long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). We show that neural activity causes dynamic reversible changes in PI4P metabolism in dendrites. Upon LTP induction, PI4KIIIα, a type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, localizes to the dendritic plasma membrane (PM) in a calcium-dependent manner and causes substantial increase in the levels of PI4P. Acute inhibition of PI4KIIIα activity abolishes trafficking of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor to the PM during LTP induction, and silencing of PI4KIIIα expression in the hippocampal CA1 region causes severe impairment of LTP and long-term memory. Collectively, our results identify an essential role for PI4KIIIα-dependent PI4P synthesis in synaptic plasticity of central nervous system neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) counteracts the onset of cancer and aging by removing helix-distorting DNA lesions via a “cut-and-patch”-type reaction. The regulatory mechanisms that drive NER through its successive damage recognition, verification, incision, and gap restoration reaction steps remain elusive. Here, we show that the RAD5-related translocase HLTF facilitates repair through active eviction of incised damaged DNA together with associated repair proteins. Our data show a dual-incision-dependent recruitment of HLTF to the NER incision complex, which is mediated by HLTF’s HIRAN domain that binds 3′-OH single-stranded DNA ends. HLTF’s translocase motor subsequently promotes the dissociation of the stably damage-bound incision complex together with the incised oligonucleotide, allowing for an efficient PCNA loading and initiation of repair synthesis. Our findings uncover HLTF as an important NER factor that actively evicts DNA damage, thereby providing additional quality control by coordinating the transition between the excision and DNA synthesis steps to safeguard genome integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we used RNA capture-seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning. Combining these data with cell-type-specific ATAC-seq on neurons that had been selectively activated by fear extinction learning, we find inducible 434 lncRNAs that are derived from enhancer regions in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. In particular, we discover an experience-induced lncRNA we call ADRAM (activity-dependent lncRNA associated with memory) that acts as both a scaffold and a combinatorial guide to recruit the brain-enriched chaperone protein 14-3-3 to the promoter of the memory-associated immediate-early gene Nr4a2 and is required fear extinction memory. This study expands the lexicon of experience-dependent lncRNA activity in the brain and highlights enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) as key players in the epigenomic regulation of gene expression associated with the formation of fear extinction memory.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas nucleases are widely used as versatile genome-engineering tools. Recent studies identified functionally divergent type V Cas12 family enzymes. Among them, Cas12c2 binds a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) and recognizes double-stranded DNA targets with a short TN PAM. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Cas12c2–guide RNA binary complex and the Cas12c2–guide RNA–target DNA ternary complex. The structures revealed that the crRNA and tracrRNA form an unexpected X-junction architecture, and that Cas12c2 recognizes a single T nucleotide in the PAM through specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with two arginine residues. Furthermore, our biochemical analyses indicated that Cas12c2 processes its precursor crRNA to a mature crRNA using the RuvC catalytic site through a unique mechanism. Collectively, our findings improve the mechanistic understanding of diverse type V CRISPR-Cas effectors.

Abstract: Summary
Stable function of networks requires that synapses adapt their strength to levels of neuronal activity, and failure to do so results in cognitive disorders. How such homeostatic regulation may be implemented in mammalian synapses remains poorly understood. Here we show that the phosphorylation status of several positions of the active-zone (AZ) protein RIM1 are relevant for synaptic glutamate release. Position RIMS1045 is necessary and sufficient for expression of silencing-induced homeostatic plasticity and is kept phosphorylated by serine arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2). SRPK2-induced upscaling of synaptic release leads to additional RIM1 nanoclusters and docked vesicles at the AZ and is not observed in the absence of RIM1 and occluded by RIMS1045E. Our data suggest that SRPK2 and RIM1 represent a presynaptic phosphosignaling hub that is involved in the homeostatic balance of synaptic coupling of neuronal networks.

Abstract: Summary
MLL rearrangements produce fusion oncoproteins that drive leukemia development, but the direct effects of MLL-fusion inactivation remain poorly defined. We designed models with degradable MLL::AF9 where treatment with small molecules induces rapid degradation. We leveraged the kinetics of this system to identify a core subset of MLL::AF9 target genes where MLL::AF9 degradation induces changes in transcriptional elongation within 15 minutes. MLL::AF9 degradation subsequently causes loss of a transcriptionally active chromatin landscape. We used this insight to assess the effectiveness of small molecules that target members of the MLL::AF9 multiprotein complex, specifically DOT1L and MENIN. Combined DOT1L/MENIN inhibition resembles MLL::AF9 degradation, whereas single-agent treatment has more modest effects on MLL::AF9 occupancy and gene expression. Our data show that MLL::AF9 degradation leads to decreases in transcriptional elongation prior to changes in chromatin landscape at select loci and that combined inhibition of chromatin complexes releases the MLL::AF9 oncoprotein from chromatin globally.

Abstract: Summary
The 12-h clock coordinates lipid homeostasis, energy metabolism, and stress rhythms via the transcriptional regulator XBP1. However, the biochemical and physiological bases for integrated control of the 12-h clock and diverse metabolic pathways remain unclear. Here, we show that steroid receptor coactivator SRC-3 coactivates XBP1 transcription and regulates hepatic 12-h cistrome and gene rhythmicity. Mice lacking SRC-3 show abnormal 12-h rhythms in hepatic transcription, metabolic functions, systemic energetics, and rate-limiting lipid metabolic processes, including triglyceride, phospholipid, and cardiolipin pathways. Notably, 12-h clock coactivation is not only preserved, with its cistromic activation priming ahead of the zeitgeber cue of light, but concomitant with rhythmic remodeling in the absence of food. These findings reveal that SRC-3 integrates the mammalian 12-h clock, energy metabolism, and membrane and lipid homeostasis and demonstrates a role for the 12-h clock machinery as an active transcriptional mechanism in anticipating physiological and metabolic energy needs and stresses.

Abstract: RACGAP1 (Rac GTPase-activating protein 1) is correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, but the role of RACGAP1 in cervical cancer has not been fully reported. Analysis of RACGAP1 expression data in cervical cancer from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was carried out by GEPIA and UALCAN websites. In addition, the UALCAN database was used to identify the RACGAP1 positively correlated genes, which were used for the enrichment analysis. qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and immunofluorescence were utilized to measure RACGAP1 expression in tissues and cells. Western blot, flow cytometry, MTT, and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of RACGAP1 on cell cycle, growth and viability in cervical cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that the level of RACGAP1 was aberrantly increased in cervical cancer, which was confirmed in cervical cancer tissues and cells. RACGAP1 associated genes, including CDC25C, were mainly enriched in cell cycle pathway, and RACGAP1 expression was negatively associated with CDC25C expression. RACGAP1 overexpression was related to patient’s poor prognosis and promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, RACGAP1 knockdown decreased the level of CDC2, p-CDC2, CDC25C, and Cyclin B1, inhibited proliferation and delayed cell cycle progression in cervical cancer cells. In mechanism, overexpression of CDC25C attenuated RACGAP1 knockdown-mediated cell growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest. Taken together, this study demonstrated that RACGAP1 was overexpressed in cervical cancer, and downregulation of RACGAP1 could inhibit the cervical cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through regulating CDC25C expression.

Abstract: Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a key phenomenon in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced cell death. However, the role of ROS in necroptosis remains mostly elusive. In this study, we show that TNF-α induces the mitochondrial accumulation of superoxide anions, not H2O2, in cancer cells undergoing necroptosis. TNF-α-induced mitochondrial superoxide anions production is strictly RIP3 expression-dependent. Unexpectedly, TNF-α stimulates NADPH oxidase (NOX), not mitochondrial energy metabolism, to activate superoxide production in the RIP3-positive cancer cells. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide-metabolizing enzymes, such as manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and peroxiredoxin III, are not involved in the superoxide accumulation. Mitochondrial-targeted superoxide scavengers and a NOX inhibitor eliminate the accumulated superoxide without affecting TNF-α-induced necroptosis. Therefore, our study provides the first evidence that mitochondrial superoxide accumulation is a consequence of necroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Hemorrhage initially triggers a rise in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) that maintains blood pressure (BP); however, SNA is suppressed following severe blood loss causing hypotension. We hypothesized that adrenergic C1 neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (C1RVLM) drive the increase in SNA during compensated hemorrhage, and a reduction in C1RVLM contributes to hypotension during decompensated hemorrhage. Using fiber photometry, we demonstrate that C1RVLM activity increases during compensated hemorrhage and falls at the onset of decompensated hemorrhage. Using optogenetics combined with direct recordings of SNA, we show that C1RVLM activation mediates the rise in SNA and contributes to BP stability during compensated hemorrhage, whereas a suppression of C1RVLM activity is associated with cardiovascular collapse during decompensated hemorrhage. Notably, re-activating C1RVLM during decompensated hemorrhage restores BP to normal levels. In conclusion, C1 neurons are a nodal point for the sympathetic response to blood loss.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate uncoupler protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) under physiological cold exposure and noradrenaline (NA) stimulation to increase thermogenesis. However, the endogenous regulator of ROS in activated BAT and its role in pathological conditions remain unclear. We show that serum levels of selenoprotein P (SeP; encoded by SELENOP) negatively correlate with BAT activity in humans. Physiological cold exposure downregulates Selenop in BAT. Selenop knockout mice show higher rectal temperatures and UCP1 sulfenylation during cold exposure. SeP treatment to brown adipocytes eliminated the NA-induced mitochondrial ROS by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 and impaired cellular thermogenesis. A high-fat/high-sucrose diet elevates serum SeP levels and diminishes the elevated NA-induced thermogenesis in BAT-Selenop KO mice. Therefore, SeP is the intrinsic factor inducing reductive stress that impairs thermogenesis in BAT and may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Axons experience significant strain caused by organismal development and movement. A combination of intrinsic mechanical resistance and external shielding by surrounding tissues prevents axonal damage, although the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here, we reveal a neuroprotective function of neuron-epidermal attachment in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that a gain-of-function mutation in the epidermal hemidesmosome component LET-805/myotactin, in combination with a loss-of-function mutation in UNC-70/β-spectrin, disrupts the uniform attachment and subsequent embedment of sensory axons within the epidermis during development. This generates regions of high tension within axons, leading to spontaneous axonal breaks and degeneration. Completely preventing attachment, by disrupting HIM-4/hemicentin or MEC-5/collagen, eliminates tension and alleviates damage. Finally, we demonstrate that progressive neuron-epidermal attachment via LET-805/myotactin is induced by the axon during development, as well as during regeneration after injury. Together, these results reveal that establishment of uniform neuron-epidermal attachment is critical to protect axons from mechanical strain during development.

Abstract: Summary
The protein C receptor (Procr) has been implicated as a stem cell surface marker in several tissues. It is unknown whether Procr acts as a functional signaling receptor in stem cells. Here, by conditional knockout in mammary stem cells (MaSCs), we demonstrate that Procr is essential for mammary gland development and homeostasis. Through proteomics profiling, we identify that, upon stimulation by the ligand protein C, Procr interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90AA1) via its short cytoplasmic tail, recruiting Src and IGF1R to the complex at the plasma membrane. We show that Procr acts as a signaling receptor of protein C in regulation of MaSCs through HSP90, Src, and IGF1R in vitro. In vivo, IGF1R deletion in MaSCs displays similar phenotypes to Procr deletion. These findings illustrate the essential role of Procr signaling in MaSC maintenance, shedding light onto the molecular regulation by Procr in tissue stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The adipose tissue is a key site regulating energy metabolism. One of the contributing factors behind this is browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). However, knowledge of the intracellular determinants of the browning process remains incomplete. By generating adipocyte-specific Senp2 knockout (Senp2-aKO) mice, here we show that SENP2 negatively regulates browning by de-conjugating small ubiquitin-like modifiers from C/EBPβ. Senp2-aKO mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity due to increased energy expenditure and heat production. Senp2 knockout promotes beige adipocyte accumulation in inguinal WAT by upregulation of thermogenic gene expression. In addition, SENP2 knockdown promotes thermogenic adipocyte differentiation of precursor cells isolated from inguinal and epididymal WATs. Mechanistically, sumoylated C/EBPβ, a target of SENP2, suppresses expression of HOXC10, a browning inhibitor, by recruiting a transcriptional repressor DAXX. These findings indicate that a SENP2-C/EBPβ-HOXC10 axis operates for the control of beige adipogenesis in inguinal WAT.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests that microbiome-host crosstalk regulates intestinal immune activity and predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NF-κB is a master regulator of immune function and a validated target for the treatment of IBD. Here, we identify five Clostridium strains that suppress immune-mediated NF-κB activation in epithelial cell lines, PBMCs, and gut epithelial organoids from healthy human subjects and patients with IBD. Cell-free culture supernatant from Clostridium bolteae AHG0001 strain, but not the reference C. bolteae BAA-613 strain, suppresses inflammatory responses and endoplasmic reticulum stress in gut epithelial organoids derived from Winnie mice. The in vivo responses to Clostridium bolteae AHG0001 and BAA-613 mirror the in vitro activity. Thus, using our in vitro screening of bacteria capable of suppressing NF-κB in the context of IBD and using an ex vivo organoid-based approach, we identify a strain capable of alleviating colitis in a relevant pre-clinical animal model of IBD.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells coordinate intrinsic and extrinsic, local and systemic, cues to maintain the proper balance between self-renewal and differentiation. However, the precise mechanisms stem cells use to integrate these signals remain elusive. Here, we show that Escargot (Esg), a member of the Snail family of transcription factors, regulates the maintenance of somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in the Drosophila testis by attenuating the activity of the pro-differentiation insulin receptor (InR) pathway. Esg positively regulates the expression of an antagonist of insulin signaling, ImpL2, while also attenuating the expression of InR. Furthermore, Esg-mediated repression of the InR pathway is required to suppress CySC loss in response to starvation. Given the conservation of Snail-family transcription factors, characterizing the mechanisms by which Esg regulates cell-fate decisions during homeostasis and a decline in nutrient availability is likely to provide insight into the metabolic regulation of stem cell behavior in other tissues and organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Although features of ribosome assembly are shared between species, our understanding of the diversity, complexity, dynamics, and regulation of ribosome production in multicellular organisms remains incomplete. To gain insights into ribosome biogenesis in human cells, we perform a genome-wide loss-of-function screen combined with differential labeling of pre-existing and newly assembled ribosomes. These efforts identify two functionally uncharacterized genes, C1orf109 and SPATA5. We provide evidence that these factors, together with CINP and SPATA5L1, control a late step of human pre-60S maturation in the cytoplasm. Loss of either C1orf109 or SPATA5 impairs global protein synthesis. These results link ribosome assembly with neurodevelopmental disorders associated with recessive SPATA5 mutations. Based on these findings, we propose that the expanded repertoire of ribosome biogenesis factors likely enables multicellular organisms to coordinate multiple steps of ribosome production in response to different developmental and environmental stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
As a biological pump, the heart needs to consume a substantial amount of energy to maintain sustained beating. Myocardial energy metabolism was recently reported to be related to the loss of proliferative capacity in cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, the intrinsic relationship between beating rate and proliferation in CMs and whether energy metabolism can regulate this relationship remains unclear. In this study, we find that moderate heart rate reduction (HRR) induces CM proliferation under physiological conditions and promotes cardiac regenerative repair after myocardial injury. Mechanistically, moderate HRR induces G1/S transition and increases the expression of glycolytic enzymes in CMs. Furthermore, moderate HRR induces a metabolic pattern switch, activating glucose metabolism and increasing the relative proportion of ATP production by the glycolytic pathway for biosynthesis of substrates needed for proliferative CMs. These results highlight the potential therapeutic role of HRR in not only acute myocardial protection but also long-term CM restoration.

Abstract: In 2009 Candida auris was first isolated as fungal pathogen of human disease from ear canal of a patient in Japan. In less than a decade, this pathogen has rapidly spread around the world and has now become a major health challenge that is of particular concern because many strains are resistant to multiple class of antifungal drugs. The lack of available antifungals and rapid increase of this fungal pathogen provides an incentive for the development of new and more potent anticandidal drugs and drug combinatorial treatments. Here we have explored the growth inhibitory activity against C. auris of a synthetic dipeptide glutamine analogue, L-norvalyl-N3-(4-methoxyfumaroyl)-L-2,3- diaminopropanoic acid (Nva-FMDP), that acts as an inhibitor of glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) synthase - a key enzyme in the synthesis of cell wall chitin. We observed that in contrast to FLC susceptible isolates of C. auris, FLC resistant isolates had elevated cell wall chitin and were susceptible to inhibition by Nva-FMDP. The growth kinetics of C. auris in RPMI-1640 medium revealed that the growth of FLC resistant isolates were 50–60% more inhibited by Nva-FMDP (8 μ g/ml) compared to a FLC susceptible isolate. Fluconazole resistant strains displayed increased transcription of CHS1, CHS2 and CHS3, and the chitin content of the fluconazole resistant strains was reduced following the Nva-FMDP treatment. Therefore, the higher chitin content in FLC resistant C. auris isolates may make the strain more susceptible to inhibition of the antifungal activity of the Nva-FMDP peptide conjugate.

Abstract: Summary
Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a DNA/RNA-binding protein that is involved in DNA repair and RNA processing. FUS is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FUS-mediated neurodegeneration are largely unknown. Here, using a Drosophila model, we showed that the overexpression of glutathione transferase omega 2 (GstO2) reduces cytoplasmic FUS aggregates and prevents neurodegenerative phenotypes, including neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. We found a FUS glutathionylation site at the 447th cysteine residue in the RanBP2-type ZnF domain. The glutathionylation of FUS induces FUS aggregation by promoting phase separation. GstO2 reduced cytoplasmic FUS aggregation by deglutathionylation in Drosophila brains. Moreover, we demonstrated that the overexpression of human GSTO1, the homolog of Drosophila GstO2, attenuates FUS-induced neurotoxicity and cytoplasmic FUS accumulation in mouse neuronal cells. Thus, the modulation of FUS glutathionylation might be a promising therapeutic strategy for FUS-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) represents an important but understudied means of cell-cell communication in cancer. Among the currently described classes of EVs, tumor-derived microvesicles (TMVs) comprise a class of vesicles released directly from the cell surface. TMVs contain abundant cargo, including functional proteins and miRNA, which can be transferred to and alter the behavior of recipient cells. Here, we document that a fraction of extracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is enclosed within TMVs and protected from nuclease degradation. dsDNA inclusion in TMVs is regulated by ARF6 cycling and occurs with the cytosolic DNA sensor, cGAS, but independent of amphisome or micronuclei components. Our studies suggest that dsDNA is trafficked to TMVs via a mechanism distinct from the multivesicular body-dependent secretion reported for the extracellular release of cytosolic DNA. Furthermore, TMV dsDNA can be transferred to recipient cells with consequences to recipient cell behavior, reinforcing its relevance in mediating cell-cell communication.

Abstract: Background
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) as an inorganic compound is used to treat various cancers and other diseases. It has been reported that arsenic trioxide induced cellular apoptosis in certain kinds of cancers, including prostate cancers. The present study aimed to elucidate the crucial cooperative role of arsenic trioxide and Curcumin and their ability to protect against prostate cancers by targeting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expression of apoptosis-related genes.
Material and methods
The human prostate cell lines (LNCaP and PC3) were treated with different concentrations of Curcumin and As2O3 alone and combined to find effective doses and IC50 values. Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin/P.I. staining, the proliferative inhibitory effect was assessed by Micro Culture Tetrazolium Test (MTT), and mRNA levels of KLK2, E-cadherin, SNAIL, angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), and apoptosis genes (BAX, Bcl2, and P53) expression were investigated by the real-time PCR method. ANOVA and t-test were used to appraise the results.
Results
For the first time, we presented that the combination therapy of Curcumin and As2O3 increases prostate cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits proliferation; Our data displayed that Curcumin (15 μM and 10 μM in PC3 and LNCap), As2O3 (8 μM and 5 μM in PC3 and LNCap), and also their combination (15 μM Curcumin and 8 μM As2O3 in PC3, 10 μM Curcumin and 5 μM As2O3 in LNCap cell lines) significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited cell growth (P < 0.05) compared with each drug alone. Generally, both cell lines treated with the combination of Curcumin and As2O3 displayed decreased angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), apoptosis genes (BAX and Bcl2), and prostate cancer marker (KLK2), the zinc-finger protein (SNAIL); and an increase in expression (P < 0.05) of cell–cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and tumor suppressor gene (P53) genes.
Conclusions
The antitumor effects of combination therapy with As2O3 and Curcumin have been displayed on prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3), which probably originates from their potential to induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells simultaneously.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental progression and cellular diversity are largely driven by transcription factors (TFs); yet, characterizing their loss-of-function phenotypes remains challenging and often disconnected from their underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we combine single-cell regulatory genomics with loss-of-function mutants to jointly assess both cellular and molecular phenotypes. Performing sci-ATAC-seq at eight overlapping time points during Drosophila mesoderm development could reconstruct the developmental trajectories of all major muscle types and reveal the TFs and enhancers involved. To systematically assess mutant phenotypes, we developed a single-nucleus genotyping strategy to process embryo pools of mixed genotypes. Applying this to four TF mutants could identify and quantify their characterized phenotypes de novo and discover new ones, while simultaneously revealing their regulatory input and mode of action. Our approach is a general framework to dissect the functional input of TFs in a systematic, unbiased manner, identifying both cellular and molecular phenotypes at a scale and resolution that has not been feasible before.
