Abstract: This study reports the impact of pulsed Ni light-induced plating (LIP), compared to the commonly used galvanostatic Ni LIP, on the initial Ni nucleation and subsequently plated busbar adhesion of Cu-plated laser-ablated p-type passivated emitter and rear Si solar cells. Initial Ni nucleate sizes decreased from 27.8 ± 9.1 to 25.4 ± 7.9 nm when the pulse-on current density during pulsed Ni LIP was increased from 50 to 178 mA cm−2, and were smaller than the 30.4 ± 9.7 nm nucleates observed with galvanostatic plating at 25 mA cm−2 after the same charge had been delivered to the surface. The density of Ni nucleation was also increased for pulsed LIP. This increased density of smaller Ni nucleates was attributed to the higher pulse-on currents inducing a larger surface potential which favoured nucleation over Volmer Weber 3D island growth of Ni. It also led to a greater density of adhesive anchor points along busbars which contributed to more adhesive plated contacts with busbar pull forces as high as 3 N mm−1 being measured when the pulse-on current density was 100 mA cm−2. However, it is shown that higher pulse-on current densities can result in unintended parasitic reactions, such as H2 evolution, and reduced busbar adhesion.

Abstract: A solar-thermal utilization heat transfer fluid with excellent light-to-heat conversion performance and good thermal reliability at high temperature is highly desirable for direct absorption solar collector (DASC). To obtain IL-based nanofluids as suitable HTFs for medium-high temperature DASCs, GO, MWCN and Ti3C2 were selected as nanoadditives, respectively. The result shows that the light-to-heat conversion efficiency of Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluid is 20% and 29% higher than that of GO/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluid and MWCN/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluid, respectively, after irradiation for 1000 s, due to the excellent optical absorption performance of Ti3C2. Furthermore, the effects of mass fractions of Ti3C2, solar concentrations and DASCs heights on the light-to-heat conversion performances of Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluids are investigated systematically. The light-to-heat conversion performances of Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluids rapidly increase with the increase of mass ratios of Ti3C2 owing to the outstanding broad-spectrum absorption properties (250–2100 nm) of Ti3C2. Moreover, the light-to-heat conversion performances of Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluids in DASCs increase with the increase of solar concentrations and DASCs heights. Additionally, the light-to-heat conversion efficiency of 0.04 wt% Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluid is 2.7 times that of the pure ionic liquid at solar concentration C = 2.5, DASCs height H = 2.5 cm and 6500 s of irradiation. The obtained high-performance Ti3C2/[BMIM]BF4 nanofluids show great potential application as advanced heat transfer fluids (HTFs) for DASCs.

Abstract: Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) with high melting points above 600 °C can mitigate the fluctuation in renewable energy supply and recover energy from industrial waste heat. Microencapsulated PCMs (MEPCMs) expand the possibilities of heat utilization owing to the presence of a thermally and chemically stable coating on the PCMs. This study improves the durability of an Al-based MEPCM (melting point: 660 °C) with an Al2O3 coating. The conventional process for preparing Al-based MEPCMs, which involves a boehmite treatment in boiling water and a heat–oxidation treatment at high temperature, was modified by adding Al(OH)3 before the boehmite treatment to precipitate Al(OH)3 on the surfaces of the Al particles after the boehmite treatment. The precipitation treatment increased the thickness of the oxide coating, thereby enabling the proposed Al-based MEPCM to withstand 300 melting and solidification cycles. In addition, the Al-based MEPCM reported an excellent heat storage capacity of 186 J g−1. This Al-based MEPCM with excellent durability and high heat storage capacity may be further developed for use in future thermal energy storage and management systems.

Abstract: Saturated aliphatic diesters sourced from vegetable oils present phase change properties particularly suitable for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES). However, inherent ester group flexibility, weak intermolecular attractions and intramolecular steric repulsions between the electronic clouds of the two ester groups, which lead to degraded packing and polymorphism, prevent these molecules from achieving optimal functionality as phase change materials (PCM). The present work demonstrates that the incorporation of a planar benzene ring between the two ester groups restricts intramolecular steric repulsion, increases the intermolecular attractions and effectively limits molecular flexibility, leading to the formation of stable monomorphs and enhancement of the thermal properties. The terephthalate diesters prepared in this work crystallized in the most stable triclinic β-polymorph regardless of cooling rate, demonstrated melting temperatures up to 86 °C and enthalpies up to 260J/g as well as higher thermal stabilities than corresponding aliphatic diol and diacid diesters. The enhanced thermal properties are mainly attributed to the π-π intermolecular attractions established between planar benzene rings inherent quadrupole moment and resonance effect from the delocalization of π-electrons within the extended conjugated π-system formed between the benzene ring and ester groups. The π-π intermolecular attractions and resonance stabilized ester group contributed to a higher energy barrier for rotation to occur at the center molecules and resulted in the stiffening of the fatty chains, facilitating periodic crystal packing.

Abstract: Polycrystalline Silicon on tunneling silicon oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts have shown great potential for the next-generation monocrystalline Si (c-Si) industrial photovoltaic technology. However, these cells typically suffer from strong parasitic absorption in the thick front poly-Si layer, which is designed to reduce metal-induced recombination. In previous work, we demonstrated an improved short-circuit current density, Jsc, by thinning the front poly-Si film in an SF6 plasma using the front metal grids as a self-aligned mask, but the sub – 100 nm thick poly-Si film is difficult to measure on an alkaline textured surface. Conventional optical techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry cannot be used due to the high scattering nature of the random pyramids. At poly-Si thicknesses below 50 nm, secondary electron microscopy (SEM) has difficulty distinguishing the poly-Si from the underlying c-Si substrate. Here, we demonstrate X-ray diffraction as an effective method to quantitatively measure the front poly-Si thickness. The thickness calculated from the diffraction peak height of the Si(111) crystallographic plane agrees well with the cross-section SEM analysis and simulations using SunSolve. We show that by thinning the front poly-Si from 200 to 60 nm, Jsc increased by 2.4 mA/cm2, while maintaining the same Voc. This led to an absolute efficiency gain of 1.73%. In addition, we also discuss possible reasons for the premature loss of passivation before the removal of all poly-Si, which prevented an even higher gain in Jsc.

Abstract: The underlying mechanisms of splicing regulation through non-canonical splice junction processing remain largely unknown. Here, we identified two RBFOX2 splicing isoforms by alternative 3' splice site selection of exon 9; the non-canonical splice junction processed RBFOX2 transcript (RBFOX2-N.C.) was expressed by the selection of the 3' splice GG acceptor sequence. The cytoplasmic localization of RBFOX2-C., a canonical splice junction-processed RBFOX2 transcript, was different from that of RBFOX2-N.C., which showed nuclear localization. In addition, we confirmed that RBFOX2-C. showed a significantly stronger localization into stress granules than RBFOX2-N.C. upon sodium arsenite treatment. Next, we investigated the importance of non-canonical 3' splice GG sequence selection of specific cis-regulatory elements using minigene constructs of the RBFOX2 gene. We found that the non-canonical 3' splice GG sequence and suboptimal branch point site adjacent region were critical for RBFOX2-N.C. expression through a non-canonical 3' splice selection. Our results suggest a regulatory mechanism for the non-canonical 3' splice selection in the RBFOX2 gene, providing a basis for studies related to the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing through non-canonical splice junction processing.

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the influence of dispersion mass transfer on thermal properties of n-hexadecane phase change emulsion in terms of thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and heat storage capacity. The microscopic evidence has been revealed, and a self-designed interface dispersion mass transfer measuring device is established to confirm with micro-formation. It is worth noting that dispersion mass transfer could enhance part of thermal properties and heat storage performance of the emulsion. In a certain range, the larger the intensity of dispersion mass transfer is, the greater the amount of deionized water homogenized by phase change materials will become. Dispersion mass transfer will weaken thermal diffusivity of phase change emulsion, the weakening ratio is about 57.1%–66.5%. In addition, dispersion mass transfer will significantly enhance thermal conductivity and heat storage performance of the emulsion, and enhancement ratio are above 11.52% and 11.56%, respectively. Although difference in the types of emulsifiers will cause small fluctuations in research results, it does not affect the influence trend of dispersion mass transfer on thermo-physical properties. Based on the finding of mass transfer, it may be quite prospective for future phase change emulsion preparation.

Abstract: Incorporation of a third monovalent cation has been shown to improve the perovskite solar cell performance and stability. In this work, an in-depth study has been carried out to understand the effect of Cs+ and K+ cations on charge carrier dynamics in methylammonium-Formamidinium based solar cell. Different spectroscopic techniques together with electrical studies have been employed to determine the role of these cations on the charge carrier traps, charge transport, charge carrier extraction, recombination, etc. Incorporation of Cs+ leads to superior crystallinity and larger grains resulting in improved passivation, reduction of non-radiative losses and improved charge transport within the perovskite layer which resulted in improved cell performance than that with K+ incorporated device. The PL quenching at short-circuit, high recombination resistance deduced from the impedance spectra, lowest Urbach energy, and high electroluminescence of the Cs+ incorporated perovskite concur with the large and colunmnar grain growth with Cs+ incorporation. With Cs+, the device efficiency reach 19.8% with high fill factor of 80.28%, whereas K+ incorporated devices demonstrate only 16.16% efficiency with a fill factor of 71.76%. Although K+ substitution leads to better stability, MAFA:Cs+ devices are superior in terms of cell performance.

Abstract: We report on the stability of encapsulated, low-pressure chemical vapor-deposited phosphorus (n+ poly-Si) doped and boron (p+ poly-Si) doped poly-Si/SiOx passivated contacts by exposing the samples to three different accelerated tests: damp heat test, thermal cycling and ultraviolet exposure, adhering closely to the IEC 61215 standard. Outdoor testing was also performed by exposing the samples in the outdoor testing field at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and preliminary data accumulated for 1000 h  from February to April of 2021 is reported. We studied non-metallized, thermally-metallized, and screen-printed n+ and p+ poly-Si by monitoring the effective minority carrier lifetime at the implied maximum power point using a Sinton lifetime tester, and recorded photoluminescence images before and after the exposure. The samples were found to be stable under all test conditions, which is encouraging for incorporation of these contacts in next-generation industrial silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Photo-thermal conversion phase change materials (PCMs), which can overcome the gap between the demand and supply of solar energy, have shown significant potential in solar energy utilization. The photo-thermal conversion efficiency is a critical factor in determining the photo-thermal conversion performance of PCMs. Most previous investigations only considered the latent heat stored by PCMs to determine the photo-thermal conversion efficiency. The sensible heat absorbed by PCMs before and after the phase transition process was neglected, which might overestimate the photo-thermal conversion performance of PCMs. As an improvement, a modified method, considering both sensible and latent heat absorption and the temperature difference within the PCMs, was proposed to determine the photo-thermal conversion efficiency of PCMs accurately. Shape-stable PCMs with polyethylene glycol (PEG), few-layers graphene (FLG), and melamine foam (MF) as the PCM, photo absorber, and supporting material, respectively, were prepared to test the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results showed that the actual efficiency of PCMs was less than 25%, which truly reflected the photo-thermal conversion performance of PCMs, demonstrating that more work should be conducted to enhance the photo-thermal conversion performance for efficient solar energy utilization.

Abstract: Recycling is an important circular economy strategy, and for photovoltaics (PV), the one that has received the greatest research attention. Recycling of PV modules is required in Europe; everywhere else it competes in the market of end-of-life options, where cost is a primary decision factor. The vast majority of PV modules sold globally are crystalline-silicon (c-Si); most of the rest of the market are cadmium telluride thin film modules whose primary manufacturer runs its own commercial-scale recycling program. While many different c-Si recycling approaches and technologies have been proposed, they generally lack accompanying cost estimates or enough process information to model costs. Herein we develop detailed estimates of seven categories of capital and operating costs along with estimates of revenue from recovered materials for each step in two proposed recycling processes for c-Si PV modules. Using these results, we develop a hypothetical third recycling process merging process steps from the original two, estimate surcharges required to achieve minimum sustainable prices for each recycling process, as well as consider how economies of scale could reduce costs. Increasing the purity of and identifying higher-value markets for recovered materials are approaches to reducing costs and increasing recycling rates in voluntary markets.

Abstract: Conjugated PEDOT is considered as a promising electrochromic (EC) material, while the unsatisfactory optical modulation contrast limits its applications. Enhancing the conjugated chain length has been proved to improve the EC performance of conjugated conductive polymers (CPs). Herein, a simple and effective solvent-induced approach is developed to prepare EC PEDOT with extended conjugated chains. A strong polarity solvent of acetonitrile is employed to electrochemically polymerize PEDOT on a well-designed Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays substrate, which facilitates a longer conjugated chain formed in the PEDOT molecules. Compared with the samples obtained in water, the acetonitrile-assistant prepared PEDOT demonstrates a superior EC behavior, including enhanced transmittance contrast (∼48% at 550 nm), fast response for coloring/bleaching (1.35 s/0.83 s), ultrahigh coloration efficiency (293.6 cm2 C-1) and improved cycling durability. Particularly, a stable optical modulation could be maintained in a wide temperature range (−10 to 100 °C) and harsh acidity environment. This work is anticipated to provide a novel and simple approach to lengthen the conjugated chains of EC PEDOT toward enhanced optical modulation and can also be applicable to various conjugated CPs.

Abstract: In the present work, a thermo-economic performance of the modified hemispherical solar still (MHSS) was studied and compared to traditional hemispherical solar still (THSS). The modulations accounted for two additives, namely: paraffin wax as phase change materials (PCM), and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles. Three cases of MHSS were investigated and compared to THSS: (0.3 wt%) CuO nanomaterials were immersed in the basin water, implementing PCM container below the basin, and combining PCM container below the basin plus mixing CuO nanoparticles in the basin water. The basin water depth in all stills was set at 1.0 cm in all cases. Moreover, the thermo-economic performance of the four studied cases was compared and evaluated by determining the freshwater productivity, the daily energy efficiency, and the freshwater cost. Experiments have been carried out on the proposed hemispherical distillers under hot climatic conditions of El-Oued (33°27′N, 7°11′E), Algeria. The results show that the single utilization of CuO/water nanofluid and pure PCM improved productivity by 60.41% and 29.17%, respectively, compared to THSS. While, the dual usage of PCM and CuO/water nanofluid further enhanced the productivity by up to 80.20%, relative to THSS. Moreover, the daily energy efficiencies of the hemispherical distillers under the different studied cases (THSS, MHSS/PCM, MHSS/CuO-water nanofluid, and MHSS/PCM + CuO-water nanofluid) were found to be 35.52%, 45.45%, 56.46%, and 63.61%), respectively. The economic feasibility of these modifications presented that the dual usage of PCM and CuO/water nanofluid is more effective as it reduces the cost of freshwater production by 75% compared to THSS.

Abstract: The potential of passivating contacts incorporating in situ phosphorus (P)-doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) films grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is demonstrated in this work by integrating these layers at the rear side of large-area (241.3 cm2) bifacial n-type Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (n-TOPCon) solar cells with diffused front emitter and screen-printed contacts. In situ doped poly-Si films are studied as their use could simplify the production of industrial n-TOPCon solar cells compared to the common approach relying on ex situ doping of intrinsic LPCVD poly-Si films. The developed poly-Si passivating contacts exhibited excellent characteristics with low recombination current densities in passivated and screen-printing metallized regions down to 2.3 fA/cm2 and 65.8 fA/cm2, respectively, and a low contact resistivity of 2.0 mΩ⋅cm2. For reaching the best passivating contact characteristics and high solar cell efficiencies, a poly-Si film thickness of 150–200 nm was found to be optimal while a polished rear surface morphology was found to be beneficial. The best solar cell reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.01% along with a high open circuit voltage of 691.7 mV, enabled by the passivating contacts with the in situ doped poly-Si films. 1-cell glass-glass laminates were also fabricated with the developed solar cells, which showed no loss in their power output both upon 400 thermal cycles and after 1000 h of damp heat testing. Lastly, a roadmap is presented, indicating strategies to achieve efficiencies up to 25.5% with n-TOPCon solar cells incorporating the in situ P-doped LPCVD poly-Si films.

Abstract: Rationally controlling the electronic property of the absorbers is effective but challenging in overcoming the drawbacks of large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit for high efficient Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells. Herein, selecting chlorides as metal precursor, for the ambient-air processed devices, an approach of heat-treating the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor films to regulate the electronic properties of CZTSSe absorbers is proposed to effectively increase the VOC towards high efficient cells. It is found that though the temperature of heat-treatment can lead to similar CZTSSe absorber films in composition and crystallinity, the final photovoltaic performance of the cells are dramatic difference. An efficiency of 9.20% with a large VOC of 464 mV was achieved from the 400 oC treated precursor film, whereas the non-treated cells obtained 6.38% efficiency and 399 mV VOC, realizing the VOC deficit decreased from 711 to 594 mV. Detailed investigations indicate a proper heat-treating temperature can significantly improve the electric property of the absorber layers, making it possess reduced band-tailing effects, lower Urbach energy, larger recombination resistance and longer carrier lifetime for enhancing the device efficiency. Such effective approach of directly heat-treating the precursor films to rationally regulate electric properties of the absorbers might provide a new way to identify the origin of the VOC deficit for high efficient CZTSSe solar cells.

Abstract: Carbonate salt is a potential heat storage material for solar thermal power. Aimed at calculating the effective thermal conductivity of Li2CO3-K2CO3 eutectic doped with carbon nanotube (CNT), a theoretical calculation method based on the three-dimensional random curl structure model was developed. Meanwhile, for the purpose of method verification, CNT composite molten salt was prepared by high-energy ball grinding method. The curl degree of carbon nanotube was determined by image identification technique. The effective thermal conductivity of the composite molten salt was measured to validate the calculation model. The comparison showed that, for well-mixed CNT composite molten salt, the error of the theoretical calculation model was less than 8.5%, which indicated that this calculation model can be used to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of CNT composite molten salt. Moreover, the influence of key factors such as the curl degree and aspect ratio of CNT on the effective thermal conductivity of composite molten salt were revealed. The results included that, first, the effective thermal conductivity (λeff) of composite molten salt decreased with increasing CNT curl degree. Second, increasing CNT aspect ratio to 175 could improve λeff of composite molten salt. Third, the increase of CNT thermal conductivity was the key factor to the improvement of λeff of composite molten salt. Fourth, λeff of the composite molten salt could be significantly increased when the order of magnitude of the interfacial thermal resistance (m2·K·W−1) was reduced to 10−7.

Abstract: Sorption thermal energy storage is considered as a promising method to reduce energy consumption of building heating. MgCl2⋅6H2O could be a good candidate due to its high energy storage density. This paper first summarizes phase equilibrium lines of four MgCl2 hydration/dehydration processes to evaluate reaction enthalpy and entropy variation. Thermal diffusivities and specific heat of MgCl2, MgCl2·6H2O and MgCl2-ENG composite are determined which are compared with common counterparts of MgSO4·7H2O and MgSO4-ENG. Then the performance of open sorption thermal energy storage system is assessed in terms of various sorbents. Results show that the obtained thermal conductivities of MgCl2·6H2O range from 0.15 W m−1 K−1 to 0.96 W m−1 K−1 at the temperature range of 15–70 °C while thermal conductivities of MgSO4·7H2O range between 0.29 W m−1 K−1 and 0.68 W m−1 K−1 at 20–45 °C. At 20 °C testing temperature, thermal conductivities of composite MgCl2 are improved which range between 0.97 W m−1 K−1 and 2.92 W m−1 K−1 under the condition of 500–900 kg m−3 density and 67–80% mass ratio of salt. Besides, MgCl2 composite is preferable for open sorption thermal energy storage which could achieve stable heat output for more than 4 h under the conditions of 15.4 °C inlet temperature, 40% relative humidity and 0.26 m s−1 air velocity.

Abstract: NaCl–KCl–CaCl2 eutectic salt was developed using the thermodynamic calculation and experimental validation for the ultra-high-temperature thermal storage. Substitutional solution model (SSM) was used to describe the liquid phase and solid solution phase, and stoichiometric compound was applied to depict the intermediate phase. The predicted eutectic temperature (481.3 °C) of NaCl–KCl–CaCl2 eutectic salt agrees well with experimental value (496.3 °C). The actual eutectic point of NaCl–KCl–CaCl2 system is placed at T = 496.3 °C, XNaCl = 0.408 mol, XKCl = 0.075 mol and XCaCl2 = 0.517 mol. The fusion enthalpy is 171.5 J/g. The weight loss is only 1.7 wt% even at 900.0 °C and 939.0 °C is determined to be the upper limit of working temperature. The average liquid specific heat capacity is 0.80 ± 0.15 (J/g⋅oC). The cost of NaCl–KCl–CaCl2 eutectic salt is only 51.6% of solar salt and 54.3% of NaCl–KCl–MgCl2 salt. SSM of thermodynamic calculation can be used as a reasonable model to optimize the chlorides salts in future. The developed NaCl–KCl–CaCl2 eutectic salts have relatively better thermo-physical properties particularly excellent ultra-high-temperature thermal stability and lower cost, and can be considered as the ultra-high-temperature thermal energy storage materials.

Abstract: Seeking efficient light trapping structures with both superior omnidirectional and electrical performance is always on the way for increasing electrical energy output of c-Si solar cell over a wide range of light incident angle (θ). Here, tile angle (δ) of quasi-periodic structure arrays is systematically modulated from 35.9° to 72.8° on diamond-wire-sawn (DWS) c-Si by a simple and cost-effective Cu and Ni co-assisted chemical etching way followed by a post treatment. Interestingly, compared with the conventional micro pyramid (MP), the optimized inverted pyramid (IP) like arrays with a δ of 64° possess both lower light reflectance and carrier recombination, leading to a corresponding solar cell with a higher efficiency (∼19.67%) than that of MP based counterpart (∼19.31%). Moreover, during the increase of θ, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 64° IP based cell drops much more slowly than that of MP based one by properly adjusting the relative position of the structure arrays and incident light, indicating its omnidirectional property. Simultaneously, a maximum relative enhancement of electrical output power approaching ∼5.8% in the θ range of −90°–90° is achieved on 64° IP based cell compared to the MP based one, the mechanism behind which is further explained by optical simulation. The above finds pave a new way to increase the electrical energy output in a simple and cost-effective way.

Abstract: SSX proteins are normally restricted to spermatogenic cells, but ectopic expression can be observed in many types of human cancer. We recently demonstrated that SSX family members may contribute to tumorigenesis by modifying chromatin structure and, in specific settings, compromise chromatin stability. Here, we used normal and tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line models to further study the effect of ectopic expression of SSX2 on nuclear organization. We show that SSX2 induces the formation of a novel type of nucleoplasmic lamin bodies. Ectopic expression of SSX2 in various breast epithelial cell lines led to the formation of a previously undescribed type of intranuclear bodies containing both A and B type lamins but no other components of the nuclear lamina. SSX2-expressing cells contained a highly variable number of lamin bodies distributed throughout the nuclear space. SSX2-mediated establishment of intranuclear lamin bodies could not be linked to previous molecular interactions of SSX proteins, including polycomb proteins and the Mediator complex, but was, however, dependent on S-phase progression. These results reveal a novel interaction between SSX2 and lamins in the nucleoplasmic space. They further suggest that SSX2 promotes the formation of chromatin neighborhoods supporting the organization of lamins into nuclear bodies. We speculate that this may have implications for the organization and functional regulation of chromatin in cancer cells. Our study contributes to the further understanding of the biology of SSX proteins in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: B-family DNA polymerases, which are found in eukaryotes, archaea, viruses, and some bacteria, participate in DNA replication and repair. Starting from the N-terminus of archaeal and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases, three domains include the N-terminal, exonuclease, and polymerase domains. The N-terminal domain of the archaeal B-family DNA polymerase has a conserved deoxyuracil-binding pocket for specially binding the deoxyuracil base on DNA. The exonuclease domain is responsible for removing the mismatched base pair. The polymerase domain is the core functional domain and takes a highly conserved structure composed of fingers, palm and thumb subdomains. Previous studies have demonstrated that the thumb subdomain mainly functions as a DNA-binding element and has coordination with the exonuclease domain and palm subdomain. To further elucidate the possible functions of the thumb subdomain of archaeal B-family DNA polymerases, the thumb subdomain of Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase was mutated, and the effects on three activities were characterized. Our results demonstrate that the thumb subdomain participates in the three activities of archaeal B-family DNA polymerases as a common structural element. Both the N-terminal deoxyuracil-binding pocket and thumb subdomain are critical for deoxyuracil binding. Moreover, the thumb subdomain assists DNA polymerization and hydrolysis reactions, but it does not contribute to the fidelity of DNA polymerization.

Abstract: Microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) with functional shell materials such as luminescent material could endow the obtained microencapsulated PCMs (MPCMs) with improved latent heat storage properties. The PCM core in turn could protect the luminescence shell from large temperature shifting and thus improve its performance. In this work, a series of MPCMs derived from n-octadecane (ODE) core and CaF2 shell were synthesized via a self-assembly method. The effects of the preparation conditions, including the core/shell mass ratio, the dosage of the emulsifier (styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, SMA) and the dosage of the chelator (Na3Cit), on the properties of the prepared ODE@CaF2 MPCMs were investigated and the optimal preparation condition was obtained. The MPCM obtained according to the optimal procedure (MPCM1) exhibited an encapsulation ratio of 54.02% and a latent heat of 131 J/g with negligible leakage. It also possessed excellent thermal reliability and significantly improved thermal conductivity. The MPCM1 could not only be utilized as good latent heat storage material and thermal regulation material, but also provided one new idea to prevent the thermal quenching of luminescence materials. In addition, this work could shed some light on the high-value utilization of recovered fluorine resources.

Abstract: Photovoltaic module prices have typically decreased faster than projections. There are two methods usually used for these projections; cumulative market shipment experience curves or detailed bottom-up cost calculations for specific technologies. The former suffers from a lack of specificity in terms of technology or changing market situations, and the latter from a lack of quantifiable uncertainty. We present an alternative bottom-up future cost model for a new vertically integrated c-Si PV factory, from poly silicon to module, incorporating input ranges and uncertainty via a Monte Carlo analysis. Neglecting profit margins, the majority of projected scenarios for global 2025 module manufacturing cost fall between 0.10 US$/W and 0.18 US$/W, due mostly to reductions in raw materials costs for module fabrication. The lowest 10th percentile projections, below 0.10 US$/W, would be realised by the largest scale manufacturers with access to very low materials costs and low operational costs. The model projects production cost learning rates between 29% and 43% compared to a long-term historical average module selling price learning rate of 24%. Analysis of the competitive position of silicon heterojunction cell technology in combination with multi-wire module technology is performed. Access to the multi-wire technology improves competitiveness of 2025 manufacturing in high labour rate countries if silver prices remain high and the cost of the multi-wire material is reduced in line with other materials, motivating continued development of this technology. Finally, continued reduction in labour intensity, through automation and throughput will enable more competitive manufacturing in higher labour cost locations.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage using phase change materials has received much attention as it can effectively relieve the contradiction of renewable energy between supply and demand. The novel bifunctional sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) composite phase change materials with photo-thermal conversion and heat storage properties were developed to promote the thermal utilization of solar energy. The Ti4O7 particles were selected as photo-thermal conversion media with full spectral absorption of sunlight and efficient photo-thermal conversion performance. 5 wt% disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DSP) and 3 wt% carboxymethyl cellulose were used to decrease supercooling and restrain phase separation of SAT, respectively. The as-prepared SAT composites with different content of Ti4O7 possess a low supercooling degree of 0.9–1.5 °C and high latent heat of 228.6–257.7 kJ kg-1. Ti4O7 has a stable absorption capacity covering the full solar spectrum (200–2500 nm) and the absorption capacity of SAT and DSP in the infrared light even more than Ti4O7 at 1900 nm–2500 nm. The SAT composite sample with 10 wt% Ti4O7 has the best total solar absorption capacity of 93.33% more than Ti4O7 of 92.76% because SAT and DSP have outstanding absorption capacity in the long-wave infrared wavelength. The photo-thermal storage efficiency of all SAT composite photo-thermal conversion phase change materials exceeds 50%, of which the composite with 10 wt% Ti4O7 has the optimal photo-thermal conversion storage efficiency of 76.63%. The composite photo-thermal storage phase change materials have potential applications in solar energy systems.

Abstract: Multifunctional electrochromic (EC) devices are very important for the current research on smart electronic devices. Herein, we report a robust and swiftly multicolor EC energy storage device design based on polyaniline (PANI) cathode. To achieve this goal, we systematically studied the EC properties of PANI in aqueous and organic Zn2+ electrolytes for the first time. Compared with Zn2+ aqueous electrolyte, the PANI film measured in organic Zn2+ electrolyte delivered a fast-switching time (τc/τb = 2.0/2.4 s), high optical contrast (72.2%), high coloration efficiency (205 cm C−1), and good cycle stability (optical contrast remains 92.7% after 10,000 cycles). The excellent EC performance could be attributed to the good wettability of the interface between organic Zn2+ electrolyte and PANI film, which supports rapid charge transfer kinetics. The PANI cathode in the organic Zn2+ electrolyte also provided a multicolor electrochromism (light yellow, green and dark green) along with a high specific capacitance of 26.4 mAh m−2 and 72.2% spectral modulation range at a current density of 0.1 A m−2, excellent rate capability of 86.4% capacity retention and 81.3% spectral modulation even at an 8-fold current-density increase. The laboratory prototype device also verified the EC energy storage performance of organic Zn2+ intercalated/deintercalated PANI, confirming that they are suitable for highly robust multicolor EC energy storage applications.

Abstract: Solar thermal absorber coatings play an important role in the opto-thermal efficiency of receivers in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Two standard figures of merit are the solar absorptance αsol and thermal emittance εth, derived from spectral directional hemispherical reflectance measurements at room temperature. These two figures of merit allow comparing coating formulations in terms of performance and durability. In this study, a black coating and a solar selective coating are optically characterized by different laboratories to compare spectral datasets, solar absorptance αsol and thermal emittance εth calculations. The comparison includes various benchtop spectrophotometers operating in the UV-VIS-NIR and Infrared spectral ranges as well as three commercial portable reflectometers/emissometers. A good agreement is found between the nine parties participating in this intercomparison campaign. The black coating αsol value is 96.6 ± 0.2%, while the solar selective coating αsol value is 94.5 ± 0.4%. For the thermal emittance, spectral data is concatenated and integrated from 0.3 to 16 μm. The black coating εth value calculated at 650 °C is 80.8 ± 3.8%, while the solar selective coating εth value calculated at 650 °C is 25.0 ± 0.5%.

Abstract: The NaCl–CaCl2 based composite is a novel high-temperature heat transfer and solar thermal storage material with enhanced specific heat capacity by dissolving metallic magnesium in the molten salt. However, the enhancement mechanism and the interactions between Mg atoms and various ions in the molten NaCl–CaCl2 are not clear. In this work, the interfacial effects of local coordination structures around the nano Mg particle and the bonding characteristics between Mg atoms and molten salt ions were studied from both the chemical and physical points of view by using the ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that [MgNam]n+ and [MgCax]y + clusters are formed at the interface according to the analysis of calculated Mayer bond orders. A compressed ion layer with higer ion densities of Na+ and Cl− ions is formed around the nano Mg particle. Moreover, a calculated specific heat capacity of 1.387 J g−1 K−1 is obtained with an enhancement of 25.98% for the Mg/NaCl–CaCl2 system, which is mainly resulted from the formed compressed ion layer and decreased potential energy due to the interfacial effect. And a theoretical thermal energy storage density with an enhancement of 29.59% is achieved for the Mg/NaCl–CaCl2 composite at 873 K compared to the pure molten salt.

Abstract: Low-cost salt hydrate eutectic phase change materials (EPCMs) are attracting increasing attentions and have shown good application prospects for medium-temperature solar thermal energy storage. Water control during sample preparation, supercooling inhibition, and cycle stability are crucial to ensure the thermal reliability of salt hydrate PCM-based thermal energy storage systems. In this study, a “differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) monitoring system evolution process” is developed to prepare MgCl2·6H2O and Mg-EPCM [MgCl2·6H2O (43.0 wt%)-Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (57.0 wt%)], in which unpurified industrial bischofite is used as a precursor. Melting enthalpy of the prepared MgCl2·6H2O can be raised from 125.6 to 164.2 J/g, which is higher than that of recrystallized MgCl2·6H2O and comparable to those of guaranteed reagent (GR), 3 N (purity: 99.9%), and 4 N (purity: 99.99%) MgCl2·6H2O. Furthermore, melting enthalpy of the prepared Mg-EPCM was improved by approximately 10%, from 126 to 140.1 J/g. The latent heat storage capacity is mainly affected by the preparation method, rather than by the small amounts of impurity elements arising from the precursor (impurity rate: ≤ 0.4%). Moreover, 0.5% Sr(OH)2·8H2O has inhibited the supercooling degree of Mg-EPCM within 1.0 °C, with a melting enthalpy of 139.5 J/g. It is found that Sr(OH)2·8H2O participates in eutectic formation and simultaneously nucleates the system to inhibit supercooling. Thermal cycle testing shows that there is almost no significant degradation after 500 thermal cycles. The low-cost Mg-EPCM developed here exhibits an excellent latent heat capacity and inhibits supercooling, showing great practical potential for latent heat storage systems.

Abstract: The emergence of internet of things (IoT) has motivated research into developing Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) devices that can efficiently convert indoor light into electricity. In this work, the performance and operation of an OPV-powered Wireless Sensor network (WSN) for Building Information management system is provided through a case study. Results are shown for the operation of the WSN and how data can be acquired to build machine learning algorithms that can forecast the indoor conditions of a building, when the system is linked to an external weather station. Remarkably, our data indicates only minor degradation of the OPV when tested under indoor conditions over a 21-month period; at a luminance level of 1000 Lux, only a −10% relative drop in performance was measured. Finally, the field data is used to optimise the size of the OPV and battery for future indoor applications which possess different energy loads. Based on the energy efficiency model, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) of the indoor applications system is calculated for different size combinations of PV, battery sizes and load energies. This model provides a method to calculate the required OPV output power to ensure remote operation of other IoT electronics.

Abstract: Soiling can significantly reduce the energy yield of PV modules, especially in desert climates due to high airborne dust concentration, frequent dust storms, and rare rain events. The current vast deployment of PV in deserts requires adequate and economically feasible strategies for the mitigation of soiling. In this regard, anti-soiling coatings (ASCs) could be a promising solution as they could significantly reduce the accumulation of dust and resultant soiling losses. To assess the outdoor performance of different ASCs, an outdoor benchmark test setup was designed and installed at eight different locations in Saudi Arabia. The soiling losses have been determined by measuring the transmittance of the samples before and after outdoor exposure for monthly (2 locations) and quarterly (6 locations) exposure periods throughout one full year. Within this study, detailed results are presented for an uncoated reference glass and 3 out of 15 coatings, which have been tested. In addition, a general coating ranking based on average monthly and quarterly soiling losses of the full set of ASCs is also presented. The results indicate huge variations of anti-soiling functionality of the coatings depending on exposure period and location. Overall, both improved and decreased anti-soiling performances have been observed for coatings compared with an uncoated reference glass. An investigation on the correlation between the daily soiling loss and weather parameters indicates that besides precipitation and particulate concentration in the air, also dew and its interaction with the coatings is an important influencing parameter strongly affecting soiling rates. Looking at the two most promising coatings with very low-adhesive properties, the overall performance benefit is higher for a hydrophilic surface in high humid areas (coastal) and a hydrophobic surface in dry areas (central desert).

Abstract: The solid-liquid phase change energy storage system promoted the efficient and sustainable utilization of dispersive and intermittent renewable energy. Low energy storage rate and unbalanced thermophysical characteristics existed in the vertical shell-and-tube heat storage tubes. To improve thermal properties and melting uniformity, this paper proposed a non-uniform angled fin type considering the optimization by the non-uniform arrangement and angled fins with small angles. A visual experimental platform was designed and built, and the reliability of the numerical model was verified by the experimental results. Numerical simulations of a single shell-and-tube heat storage tube regarding maximizing phase change rate were carried out. The development of the phase change interface and transient temperature field during the charging process of the non-uniform angled fins with downward 10° were obtained. Results showed that, compared with the uniform straight fin tube, the non-uniform angled fin can effectively promote the melting process of the whole fin tube, especially in the bottom area, leading to a 69.59% reduction in complete melting time. This provided a reference for the performance optimization of the shell-and-tube finned phase change heat storage tube.

Abstract: Recently, the cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbIBr2) materials demonstrating the most balanced bandgap and stability among all inorganic perovskite analogs have received great attention in photovoltaic community. However, the poor quality of solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films with small grains and massive voids and defects severely impedes its further development. This obstacle issue mainly roots from the slow crystallization process of perovskites when using traditional high boiling point solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Herein, a novel solvent engineering strategy, namely alcohol-induced rapid crystallization process, is originally developed. We intentionally add some low boiling point alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and n-butanol, to form a lower boiling point DMSO-alcohol azeotropic mixture, which can be volatilized quickly and effectively accelerate the crystallization process of CsPbIBr2 films. Meanwhile, we elaborately adopt some CsI additives to suppress the intrinsic self-doping and passivate the defects of perovskites. Besides, the influence of annealing temperatures on the film quality and device performance is also investigated in this study. Consequently, the pinhole-free, highly crystallized CsPbIBr2 films with large grains and a preferable (100) orientation are successfully achieved via CsI/methanol treatment recipe when annealed at the optimized temperature of 280 °C. The as-obtained perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a superior long-term stability feature yield a highly promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.49%. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency among all CsPbIBr2 inorganic PSCs.

Abstract: An accurate estimation of the photovoltaic (PV) electrical characteristics is of significance to the decision-making related to the establishment and operation of PV systems. However, most of the existing PV models are very limited to predicting the PV behaviors under uniform irradiation conditions (UICs). This paper proposes a complete solution to modeling and simulation of PV strings under partial shading conditions (PSCs). The measured current-voltage (I–V) data are first characterized by a shading information matrix containing essential environmental conditions for operating points. The model parameters are estimated via a four-state Jaya (FSJ) algorithm, which applies an exploration-exploitation adaptation mechanism to make an appropriate trade-off between global and local searching efforts. Fed by the obtained shading information and optimal parameters, the “staircase” shape I–V curve can be accurately predicted via a comprehensive analytical PV model. The experimental results are tested on two different PV strings with multi-crystalline and mono-crystalline PV technologies. Results suggest that the proposed FSJ algorithm outperforms reported state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed and prediction errors. With the optimal parameters, the analytical PV model gives superior results under various PSCs. The proposed model and algorithms can serve as an efficient alternative for modeling PV strings.

Abstract: In this paper, a WO3 film was prepared with a controllable crystalline structure by adjusting the power in a magnetron sputtering deposition process. This allowed the WO3 film combine the advantages of excellent cyclic stability imparted by highly ordered structure WO3, and fast response and satisfactory coloration efficiency imparted by highly disordered structure WO3. The adjusted WO3 sputtered film displayed superior electrochromic properties comprising high transmittance modulation (74.4% at 550 nm), large coloration efficiency (41.5 cm2·C-1), fast switching speed in addition to excellent cycle stability (93.5% transmittance modulation retention over 1000 cycles). More importantly, an all-solid-state electrochromic device (ECD) founded on this WO3 film exhibited excellent electrochromic performance due to enhanced electrochromic properties of WO3 layer. This work demonstrates a novel way for improving the performances of electrochromic (EC) films and devices.

Abstract: The electrical power generation of a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) device can be enhanced if the vacuum gap between the thermal emitter and TPV cell is at the nanoscale owing to the photon tunneling of evanescent waves. Multi-junction TPV cells with multiple bandgaps have gained interest as a method of improving their conversion efficiency by selectively absorbing the spectral radiation in each subcell. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze an optimized near-field tandem TPV converter consisting of a tungsten emitter covered by an ITO thin film (at 1500 K) and a GaInAsSb/InAs monolithic interconnected tandem TPV cell (at 300 K). We developed a simulation model by coupling the near-field radiation solved by fluctuational electrodynamics and diffusion-recombination-based charge transport equations. The optimal configuration of the near-field tandem TPV converter obtained using the genetic algorithm achieved an electrical power output of 8.42 W/cm2 and a conversion efficiency of 35.6% at a vacuum gap of 100 nm. We demonstrated that two resonance modes (i.e., surface plasmon polaritons supported by the ITO-vacuum interface and the confined waveguide mode in the tandem TPV cell) significantly contribute to the enhanced performance of the optimized system. Through loss analysis, we also demonstrate that the near-field tandem TPV converter is superior to the single-cell-based near-field TPV converter in terms of both power output and conversion efficiency. The optimization performed with the objective function of the conversion efficiency resulted in the current matching condition for the tandem TPV converter, regardless of the vacuum gap distance. In addition, the impacts of the additional series resistance and shadowing losses are explored by introducing the front contact grid.

Abstract: Thermophotonics (TPX) is a technology close to thermophotovoltaics (TPV), where a heated light-emitting diode (LED) is used as the active thermal emitter of the system. It allows to tune the heat flux, by means of electroluminescence, to a spectral range matching better the gap of a photovoltaic cell. The concept is extended to near-field thermophotonics (NF-TPX), where enhanced energy conversion is due to both electric control and wave tunnelling. We perform a thorough numerical analysis of a GaAs-based NF-TPX device, by coupling a near-field radiative heat transfer solver based on fluctuational electrodynamics with an algorithm based on a simplified version of the drift–diffusion equations in 1D. This allows for the investigation of the emission and absorption profiles in the LED and the photovoltaic (PV) cell, and for the scrutiny of the impact of key parameters. We also demonstrate that the performance obtained with this algorithm can approach idealized cases for improved devices. For the considered simplified architecture and 300 K temperature difference, we find a power density output of 1 W cm−2, underlining the potential for waste heat harvesting close to ambient temperature.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) systems with molten salts involve different operating conditions causing corrosion problems in the materials due to the high operating temperature. In this work, the corrosion behavior was studied by means of flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) and static corrosion tests in contact with the ternary mixture (KLiNa)NO3 at 550 °C. Both tests were performed by gravimetric tests (mass gain) and subsequently characterized by SEM and XRD. The results showed a substantial increase in mass gain due to the dynamic effect of the FAC test in relation to the stationary test. Consequently, the dynamic effect of the FAC test at high temperatures could cause stress corrosion cracking in the material, leading to a change in the mechanical performance of T91 steel. Therefore, the slow strain rate tensile test (SSRT) on molten salts was performed to evaluate the impact of temperature on the mechanical property performance of the material. A considerable reduction in the mechanical performance of the material was observed compared to testing the material in air under normal conditions. This research shows the real operating conditions under the corrosion effect of T91 steel and its relevance as a material for the solar thermal industry.

Abstract: In this paper, we report on the stability of CdTe devices with a structure of TCO/MZO/CdSeTe/CdTe/back-contact. The device showed reversible transitions between the light-soak state (LSS) with the best device efficiency and the dark-soak state (DSS) with an inferior efficiency. However, it showed an irreversible degradation state (DgS) driven by long-hour light soaking at an elevated temperature. We have investigated transitions between these three states from the perspective of the electric field by nm-resolution potential imaging across the devices using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The results exhibit different anomalous electric field profiles. At the LSS, the electric field exhibits a main peak inside the CdSeTe layer instead of the MZO/CdSeTe heterointerface, illustrating a buried homojunction (BHJ) of the device. At the DSS, a large electric field peak at the MZO/CdSeTe interface was measured, which probably resulted in the inferior fill factor at the DSS. At the DgS, the electric field peak at the MZO/CdSeTe interface increased further and a third electric field was measured at the back contact of the device. Device modeling using COMSOL software, in alignment with both the electric field and device current-voltage curves, elucidates that a low n-doped CdSeTe in the region near the MZO/CdSeTe interface caused the BHJ in the LSS and a loss of MZO doping and/or increase of the conduction band offset spike due to long-term stress caused the increased electric field near the MZO/CdSeTe interface at the DgS.

Abstract: Polysilicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts have attracted considerable attentions in the academic community and photovoltaic industry due to their remarkable advantages of outstanding passivation quality and low contact resistivity. Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), as one of the widely adopted techniques to prepare doped poly-Si films, is usually limited by the occurrence of blistering, especially for boron-doped (B-doped) poly-Si films. In this work, we present a study of PECVD preparation of B-doped polycrystalline silicon carbide (poly-SiCx) films with a blistering-free appearance by incorporating carbon (C) and optimizing the annealing process. It demonstrates that a thick poly-Si deposited on polished c-Si substrates with a low surface roughness tends to blister, which thus leads to a poor passivation performance. Moreover, the investigation of C content and annealing condition suggests that increasing C content or lowering incipient annealing temperature is beneficial to suppress the blistering. However, the C content needs to be well controlled to balance the passivation and contact properties, because the excessive CH4 flow during the film deposition would degrade the contact performance with a high contact resistivity (>100 mΩ cm2). Finally, the proof-of-concept devices featuring the double-sided passivating contacts (DPPCs) were fabricated with a front n-type poly-Si and rear p-type poly-SiCx, and presented an open-circuit voltage of 695 mV and an efficiency of 19.82%. The results clarify the correlation of C contents, c-Si substrate roughness and annealing process with the blistering levels and the passivation/contact properties, providing a valuable guidance for fabricating high-efficiency DPPC solar cells.

Abstract: Phase change micro/nanocapsules with a core-shell structure have great potential in solar water heating systems. To enhance the thermal conductivity of the shell, we synthesised stearic acid (SA)/Ag nanocapsules via a chemical reduction method using a Pickering emulsifier. The characterisation results confirmed the successful preparation of the SA/Ag nanocapsules. The nanocapsules had a mean diameter of 167–252 nm and a thermal storage capacity of 25.34–118.38 J/g corresponding to the volume encapsulation ratio (RV) of 69.30–96.90%. The bulk thermal conductivity of the nanocapsules was determined using the laser flash method. They showed a remarkably high effective thermal conductivity of 0.974–6.020 W/m·K. In particular, the suspensibility of the as-prepared SA/Ag nanocapsules was studied in detail, considering that the Ag shell increased the density of the nanocapsules. A single-particle model was established, and the theoretical suspension critical diameter (TSCD) was defined to comprehensively consider the effects of the terminal velocity and Brownian diffusion of the nanocapsules in the fluid. The size of the fabricated SA/Ag nanocapsules was much smaller than the calculated TSCD, indicating that the nanocapsules had good suspensibility. In addition, the thermal reliability of the nanocapsules was evaluated by subjecting them to 2000 thermal cycles, after which the latent heat of the nanocapsules reduced slightly by 0.55%.

Abstract: Colourants are the main components for the colour control of acrylic coatings for the external walls of buildings. Since the different mass proportions of cyan, magenta, and yellow colourants, the colour of the coating changes after mixing, which also affects the optical property and thermal performance of the coating. In this paper, an artificial neural network model is established, the BP algorithm is used for calculation, and the model is trained and verified by making and testing experimental samples to accurately predict the solar reflectivity by the mass proportions of trichromatic colourants and acrylic coating substrate. The mean square error is 0.0027. Meanwhile, the influence weights of the mass proportions of cyan, magenta, and yellow colourants and the acrylic coating substrate on the solar reflectivity are calculated by the model, which are 0.2863, 0.2209, and 0.4928, respectively. The increase in cyan colourant has a greater influence on the decrease in reflectivity of the blended coating. The outer surfaces of 11 samples were tested outdoors. Compared with the original solution of the acrylic coating, the maximum temperature difference of the mixed coating reached 16.03 °C. The highest temperature of the coating with the highest proportion of cyan colourant and the acrylic substrate is 10.61 °C higher than that of the coating with the lowest proportion.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated record-high thermophotovoltaic efficiency using thin-film InGaAs cells, but the power density of devices remains low. Elevated power densities are relevant to many thermophotovoltaic (TPV) applications, ranging from mobile generators to stationary energy storage of renewable electricity, and require effective management of heat and charge carriers. Here we investigate the use of single-junction InGaAs airbridge cells (ABCs) under such conditions. Experimental characterization of an InGaAs ABC with varying emitter and cell temperature is used to develop a predictive device model where carrier lifetimes and series resistances are the sole fitting parameters. The utility of this model is demonstrated through its use in identifying near-term opportunities for improving performance at elevated power densities, and for designing a thermal management strategy that maximizes overall power output. After accounting for the power necessary to cool the cells, this model shows that an InGaAs ABC with high material quality can reach a peak efficiency of ∼41% at 0.5 W/cm2, corresponding to an emitter temperature of 1070 °C, and sustain efficiencies above 36% up to 1.5 W/cm2.

Abstract: Metal oxide charge transport layers (CTLs) are significant components for fabricating high-performance thin film solar cells. Generally, sol-gel methods have been widely used to deposit high-quality metal oxide CTLs, but they usually suffer from the choices of solvents, ligands and metal precursors. Here we report a general and facile ionic liquid (n-butylammonium butyrate) approach to prepare V2O5, MoO3, WO3, NiO, ZnO and SnO2 thin films, which exhibits strong dissolving ability and good film-forming property. The thermal volatilization of ionic liquid is mild, which provides a slow and stable decomposition process of metal compounds and favors the formation of smooth and compact CTLs. All thin films are highly transparent in the visual range from the optical transmittance spectra and suitable to be CTLs in photovoltaic devices. Encouragingly, we have received the efficiencies of 15.06% and 13.38% based on the area of 0.09 and 1.21 cm2 (NiO as the hole transport layer), and 19.13% and 16.71% based on the area of 0.09 and 1.21 cm2 (SnO2 as the electron transport layer), which are obviously higher than those of devices prepared by traditional sol-gel methods.

Abstract: Full size silicon heterojunction solar cells reach conversion efficiencies above 25%. However, photoluminescence pictures of such cells (full or cut) reveal a significant recombination activity at the cell edges. Therefore, mitigating recombination at the edges can in principle represent an interesting path to unlock higher cell efficiencies. This challenge is all the more important for cells with a high perimeter/area ratio, as achieved through the cutting of full size cells. For such technologies, the edges resulting from cutting are cleaved while the remaining edges typically feature a gap where TCO is missing to avoid front to back short-circuit. In this paper, we specify the physical mechanisms involved in the edge-induced performance losses for SHJ cells. In light of these results, we provide guidelines for the mitigation of such losses at the full-size and cut cells scale for M6 to M12 sizes such as the reduction of the TCO-free region and the c-Si bulk resistivity. Having a closer look at cut cells, we calculate the cell performance as a function of its size (from half-to sixth-cell), the size of its mother cell (from M6 to M12) and the passivation quality of the cut-edges. Our results emphasize on the interest to develop suitable repassivation schemes for cut cells to improve or even surpass the efficiency of the mother cell.

Abstract: For building-integrated photovoltaic windows, colored transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells and modules were fabricated using a transparent electrode structure of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and diffuser. The transparent DBR-diffuser electrode consists of multiple layers of indium tin oxide and Al-doped zinc oxide. This optically functional electrode not only implements various colors but also enhances color clarity. The transparent DBR-diffuser electrodes were designed using optical simulation and exhibited a wide color range of blue, green, and red by simply changing the thicknesses of the indium tin oxide and Al-doped zinc oxide layers. Using only eight pairs of DBRs, the electrode showed vivid colors and suppressed color noise by 23% with the diffuser structure. Because the color can be realized with a small amount of reflected light, the efficiency of transparent solar cells does not differ substantially in color. The developed transparent DBR-diffuser electrode can be widely applied to improve the color quality of both opaque and transparent solar cells and modules composed of various materials.

Abstract: Pt-nanofluids with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property were environmentally-friendly prepared using the laser ablation in liquids (LAL) while H2O acts as a working fluid. Based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the obtained Pt nanoparticles have an average diameter of 6 nm which were strongly surrounded with H2O molecules, leading to excellent longtime durability. Moreover, fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy images indicated that the prepared sample has fluorescence property that makes it capable to absorb more light and then, to convert it to heat. The Pt-nanofluids were applied for light to heat conversion. After several continuous heating/cooling cycles, the prepared nanofluids did not lose their efficiency in terms of light to heat conversion. In addition, the potential of the Pt-nanofluids in harvesting solar energy was investigated. The infrared thermographs proved that the upper layer temperature of the Pt-nanofluids reached >49 °C after 60 min light illumination, under ≅ 0.9 Sun intensity. The obtained results proved that the prepared Pt-nanofluids have outstanding advantages, consist of fast, simple, and green synthesis method, no necessity for dispersant, high thermal-stability, long-time stability, and high performance in photo-thermal conversion. So, the Pt-nanofluids have high capability for practical solar energy utilization.

Abstract: Inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) offer a promising route towards commercialization by using undoped inorganic hole transport layers and thermally-stable electron transport layers (ETLs), which deliver good environmental stability such as water resistance. But the power-conversion-efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted flexible perovskite cells are still far below those of FPSCs in regular configuration so far. One main challenge for achieving high-performance FPSCs lies in optimizing the ETLs and their adjacent buffering layers. Herein, we modify the fullerene derivatives (Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM) ETLs by adding 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) molecules into the PCBM solutions. The addition of APTS results in smoother and denser PCBM layers via a physically steric-hindrance effect mechanism, which could benefit the electron collection between the PCBM layer and the perovskite layer. More importantly, APTS can offer nucleating sites, such as amine groups or hydroxy groups by partially hydrolyzing, to grow conformal tin oxide (SnOx) layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD), which acts as robust buffer layers to replace traditional bathocuproine (BCP) layer. Finally, high-performance inverted FPSCs based on the optimized PCBM/SnOx electron-selective layers are fabricated, delivering a best PCE of 18.62%. The unencapsulated FPSC showed a slow decay and remained above 90% of its initial PCE after being stored for more than 600 h in a damp environment with a humidity of more than 85% R.H. The strategy is demonstrated to be applicable in the future large-scale production of stable FPSCs.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) using metals/alloys have been concerned for medium temperature solar thermal storage and waste heat recovery. However, the PCMs may leak due to the solid-liquid phase change, which greatly limits the use of metallic PCMs. In this study, we report the synthesis of microencapsulated PCMs (MEPCMs) using metallic Sn as PCM core and a sol-gel coated SiO2 as shell. The as-coated microcapsules are further undergone a high temperature heat treatment at oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere. Due to the self-repairing effect, the cracked microcapsules can be sealed and stabilized, thereby forming high stabilized MEPCMs over 100 cycles. The melting point and latent heat of the Sn@SiO2–O2 microcapsules were around 233 °C and 56 J g-1 respectively, while the values were around 233 °C and 58 J g-1 for Sn@SiO2–N2 microcapsules, similar to the theoretical values of metallic Sn. The successfully prepared Sn@SiO2 MEPCMs could find wide applications in medium temperature thermal energy storage.

Abstract: An interconnected structure of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is the key point to accomplishing high efficiency over 30% due to its high performance of carrier recombination and tunneling. In general, an interconnected structure is designed by a polysilicon (poly-Si) passivating contact structure and a hydrogen-containing transparent conductive oxides (TCO). When the bottom cell structure was fabricated in mass production, poly-Si passivating contact inevitably suffered from a degradation of the passivation quality associated with the metallization firing process. In this work, we investigated the effect of hydrogen-containing indium tin oxide (ITO:H) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO:H) prepared by dc magnetron sputtering on poly-Si passivating contacts passivation degradation. The passivation quality of the poly-Si passivating contacts can be significantly improved by sputtering and annealing at 350 °C after firing of both the hydrogen-containing TCOs. The improvement on poly-Si passivating contacts passivation quality increased with the increased of annealing dwell time. When at the optimal annealing time of 30 min, the iVoc value of ITO:H increased to 725 mV while that of AZO:H increased to 710 mV, respectively. In addition, the optical and electrical properties of ITO films can be improved by annealing process, including transmittance, optical bandgap, Hall mobility and resistivity. When the annealing time is less than 30min, the contact resistivity between Ag/ITO and doped poly-Si increases slightly with the increase of annealing time. However, the optical and electrical properties of AZO films degraded, which may be due to the instability of the prepared AZO:H films. Eventually, based on this interconnected structure, a perovskite/Si tandem cell structure was designed, and silicon substrate cells could be fabricated in mass production.

Abstract: Fuel-combustion-based thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems are emerging as a viable power source for small, portable generators for a spectrum of applications such as UAVs, robotic platforms, and sensors. In TPV systems, an emitter heated to above 1000 K emits radiation that is then converted to electricity by a low bandgap photovoltaic cell. One promising class of TPV emitters are two-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs) made of tantalum, which have shown high-temperature stability at 1150–1250K over hundreds of hours [1], [2] and have been implemented in a prototype system with 4.4% fuel-to-electricity efficiency [1]. Tantalum PhCs filled and capped with hafnium oxide can enable even higher optical performance with in-band emissivities of 0.8–0.9. However, two key features are difficult to realize simultaneously: a uniformly filled cavity and a thin capping layer of hafnium oxide [3], [4]. Here, we present a process that results in reduced roughness and better thickness control of the capping layer. We use room temperature reflectance measurements and full system simulations to estimate system performance gains. This selective emitter paves the way toward efficient, practical, and portable mesoscale generators.

Abstract: As the most basic elements of photovoltaic (PV) module and power station, the defects in PV cells can affect the overall performance of the module and the operation status of the power station. Therefore, it is very important to carry out defects detection of PV cells. In this work, we have built an Electrical Pulsed Infrared Thermography (EPIT) experimental system to detect PV cells with different types of defects, such as broken gate, hidden crack, scratch and hot spot. Then, thermography sequence information of PV cells is captured by an infrared camera. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), the two supervised learning (SL) algorithms, are used to process the thermography sequence and recognize the defects. In addition, the identification effect of the two algorithms is quantitatively evaluated by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The experiment results show that the EPIT method can realize the PV cells defects detection. Under different bias excitation, QDA algorithm is superior to LDA in SNR index, which can identify various defects of PV cells effectively.

Abstract: Effect of defects mitigation on the photovoltaic (PV) performance of three different types of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), namely, single halide (methylammonium lead triiodide, MAPbI3), mixed halide (MAPbIxCl3-x) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) based bulk heterojunction (MAPbI3-PC71BM) PSCs is studied using impedance and transient spectroscopy as a function of dc voltage bias. Parameters extracted from impedance spectra and transient signals are quantitatively analysed to understand the operation mechanism of each PSC. Among the PSCs, the low frequency capacitance (Clf) values obtained near to the open circuit voltage (VOC), where charge carriers are restricted inside the device, are found to be minimum for MAPbI3 based PSCs. Whereas, bulk capacitance (Chf), high frequency resistance (Rhf) and low frequency resistance (Rlf) values are obtained to be highest for the MAPbI3 based device which exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16%. The extracted impedance parameters suggest lessened defect or ion accumulation, improved charge storage capacity/charge life-time, reduced recombination losses and ion transport for the MAPbI3 device, favoring performance enhancement. The characteristic time constants for the high frequency and low frequency processes also specify longer charge carrier lifetime and faster interfacial charge transfer process near to VOC in MAPbI3 based PSCs. In addition, transient photocurrent and photovoltage analysis confirms the existence and interplay of ion induced electric field, built-in and applied external field. Clf, Chf, Rlf and Rhf values as well as transient responses are observed to be greatly dependent on the chemical composition, grain size, grain boundaries and pinholes formed in the perovskite active layer. Based on the results from impedance measurements and transient spectroscopy, the working mechanism of each PSC is proposed in view of the interplay among ion induced electric field, built-in-field and applied electric field.

Abstract: Efficient solar thermal utilization has attracted extensive attention because it effectively alleviates carbon dioxide emissions and environmental pollution. Phase-change material (PCM) energy storage technology has been regarded as the most promising in improving its efficiency. Toward higher energy utilization efficiency, how to realize conversion and storage of solar energy into PCM is becoming progressively important. Herein, we developed low-cost and stable sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT, salt hydrate PCM) with ultra-fast solar energy charging efficiency by integrating photothermal and thermal conductivity materials. Specifically, a graphene oxide@SiO2 (GS) nanocomposite fabricated by a novel modified Stober method was employed as the nucleating agent and photothermal conversion enhancers for SAT. The supercooling degree of SAT can be reduced to 0.5 °C from 32.0 °C with the addition of 1.0 wt% GS, while the solar energy charging efficiency of SAT was increased by 92.5% when it is synergistically augmented by integrating GS and silicon carbide (SiC) foam. This study results indicate that the prepared SAT-GS-SiC composite with an enthalpy of 193.2 J/g can be potentially used to efficiently utilize solar energy.

Abstract: Various spectral control techniques can be applied to improve the performance of a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) device. For example, a back surface reflector (BSR) is a common structure to improve the performance of TPV devices. A conventional metal BSR structure enhances the photogeneration rate by increasing the absorption probability of photons via back surface reflections, affording a second chance for absorption. However, the effects of surface passivation and external luminescence introduced by BSR structures have been previously ignored, which potentially decreases the performance of TPV devices. Recently, a back gapped reflector (BGR) structure was proposed to greatly improve the performance of far-field TPV devices by reducing imperfect reflections at the semiconductor-metal interface. In the present work, the performance improvement on a thin-film, near-field InAs TPV device with a BGR is investigated, comparing its performance to that with a conventional metal BSR. Surface passivation conditions are also investigated to further improve the performance of TPV devices with back reflectors. The output power and efficiency are calculated using an iterative model combining fluctuational electrodynamics and the full drift-diffusion model. For the well-passivated condition, when the BSR is replaced by the BGR, the calculated conversion efficiency of the near-field TPV was improved from 16.4% to 21% and the output power was increased by 10%. Finally, the absorption of the back reflectors and external luminescence loss are analyzed to explain the performance improvement.

Abstract: At present, the thermal properties (melting point, thermal conductivity, etc.) of common phase change materials (PCMs) cannot be accurately modulated, which limits their application in larger fields. Pseudo ionic liquid phase change materials (PILPCMs) have presented great potential due to its tunable thermal property and high physicochemical stability. In this work, a novel PILPCM consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and urea is developed for the solar water heating system (SWHS) for hot water supply. First, the mass ration of CTAB to urea was optimized toward suitable PILPCM with desirable phase change behaviors. The eutectic formation mechanism of PILPCM was then interpreted by experimental 13CNMR and theoretical σ-profile characteristics. Afterward, the shape stability, thermal conductivity, supercooling degree, thermal stability and reliability were investigated systematically. The results showed that the formation of eutectic PILPCM was ascribed to the physical hydrogen-bonds between CTAB and urea. The CTAB-urea mixture in the mass ratio of 6:1 exhibited favorable melting point of 86.9 °C, the highest latent of 174.9 kJ/kg, excellent shape stability, low degree supercooling of about 3 °C as well as comparable thermal conductivity. Moreover, such PILPCM had satisfactory thermal stability and reliability, which was confirmed by notably higher temperature of thermal decomposition over the operating condition and slight changes of phase change behaviors after 100 thermal cycles. Conclusively, the fabricated PILPCM integrates the advantages of CTAB and urea, and shows considerable potential in the concerned SWHS case.

Abstract: Spectrally selective materials have been widely used to shield near-infrared radiation for windows in the region with a cooling-demand climate. CsxWO3 nanocrystals which exhibit strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and small polaron transfer in near-infrared radiation have attracted great attention for fabricating the spectrally selective coating. The enhancement of its optical performance remains a challenge in energy-efficient windows. Herein, F-doped CsxWO3 nanocrystals were successfully prepared by a solvothermal method, which demonstrate stronger near-infrared absorption performance than CsxWO3 nanocrystals. The introduction of fluorine can enhance the free carrier density of the nanocrystals, which can lead to a higher absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient variation of LSPR effect and small polaron transfer was explained by the variation of free carrier density and carrier mobility. When the F/W molar ratio was 0.4, the free carrier density reached 9.25 × 1014 cm-3. The spectrally selective coating prepared by F-doped CsxWO3 nanocrystals exhibited superior spectral selectivity with TVis, TNIR, Tlum, and Tsol of 67.21%, 11.85%, 72.76% and 49.01%, respectively. This substitutional doping strategy provides a promising potential to improve the spectral modulation of CsxWO3 nanocrystals for practical application of energy-saving windows.

Abstract: In this research, a novel form-stable composite phase change material (PCM) for building envelopes was prepared and evaluated. Calcium chloride hexahydrate (CCH) and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (MNH) were dissolved and mixed uniformly to obtain the binary eutectic hydrated salt (BEHS) with adjustable phase change temperature. With the increase of MNH content, the phase change temperature and latent heat of BEHS gradually decreased. The BEHS with the onset temperature and peak temperature of 21.26 °C and 27.51 °C and corresponding latent heat of 142.4 J/g was selected as the PCM and combined with the support material SiO2 to obtain BEHS/SiO2 composite PCMs，where the minimum SiO2 content to prevent BEHS from leaking was 25 wt%. The characterization results of SEM, XRD and FT-IR indicated that BEHS was successfully filled into the pore structure of SiO2, and there was good compatibility between them. By adding 2.5 wt% strontium chloride hexahydrate as a nucleating agent, the supercooling degree of BEHS/SiO2 composite PCMs was eliminated. The onset temperature and peak temperature of BEHS/SiO2 composite PCMs were measured to be 17.85 °C and 27.28 °C, respectively, and the corresponding latent heat was 97.3 J/g. A 300 melting and solidification cycles test proved that it possessed good thermal reliability. Moreover, the numerical simulation was performed to evaluate the effect of BEHS/SiO2 composite PCMs on the thermal performance and energy performance of the building. The obtained results showed that composite PCMs could effectively reduce room temperature fluctuations and energy consumption.

Abstract: The polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) as a self-polymerized form of dopamine have occurred with growing interest in biomedical applications in late years. Its natural-inspired feature as a conjugated polymer endows excellent inactivating capability for radical species to PDA-based nanoparticles that provide a theoretical foundation for applications in preventing inflammation-mediated acute kidney injury (AKI) from ROS. Here, we develop a polydopamine wrapped manganese ferrite nanoparticles (PDA@MF NPs) strategy for acute kidney injury therapy by synergistically scavenging ROS and producing O2, which further regulates macrophages amounts by decreasing M1-type and increasing M2-type. Water-soluble PDA@MF NPs were prepared in one step after the oxidative and self-polymerized process of the dopamine monomer. Here, the biodegradable PDA NPs were applied to scavenge ROS. MF NPs undertake continuous O2 production in an H2O2-based hypoxic environment. Based on this system, we aim to relieve the hypoxia, pathological symptoms, and inflammation via scavenging ROS during the O2 production process, and effective polarization to M2-type macrophages. PDA@MF NPs in this study were verified could significantly attenuate oxidative stress in vivo, reduce inflammatory events in renal, and improve renal function, which might be a potential treatment to inhibit oxidative damages and inflammatory events in renal AKI disease

Abstract: Thermionic-photovoltaic (TIPV) converters exploit both electrons and photons emitted by a hot cathode to produce electric power. In this work, a TIPV converter structured with a tungsten cathode and an In0.53Ga0.47As photovoltaic (PV) anode (0.75 eV bandgap) is demonstrated to provide an increased output voltage with respect to the reference thermionic energy converter made of the same materials and operating under similar conditions. The higher voltage, measured to be from 0.3 to 0.5 V in the explored 1150–1450 °C temperature range, is explained by the additional contribution of the PV anode. Another work function engineered TIPV converter, obtained by coating the W cathode with LaB6 and the In0.53Ga0.47As PV anode with BaFx, has led to an output power 2 orders of magnitude higher than the uncoated TIPV converter at 1200 °C cathode temperature. This opens the route towards future optimized TIPV electrodes.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) via the calcium looping (CaL) process is an emerging technology applied in third-generation concentrated solar power plants. A range of CaO-based composites was developed via binary Fe and Mn ions doping of low-cost dolomite for direct solar absorption. The doping ratio of Fe and Mn ions was investigated and optimized aiming to produce the highly efficient Fe/Mn-doped, acid-modified dolomite composites. After comprehensively considering the spectral absorptance and energy storage density, the composite with a molar ratio of Ca/Mg:Mn:Fe=100:2:4 is optimal. It possesses a relatively high spectral absorptance of 63.7% due to the generated, dark Ca-Mn-Fe oxides, which is up to ∼2.1 times higher than that of raw dolomite. Moreover, the composite exhibits excellent cycling stability (a gravimetric energy storage density loss of ∼6.6% after 30 cycles) resulting from uniformly distributed, intrinsic MgO grains. Additionally, dolomite-derived composite pellets were prepared using extrusion-spheronization, and their volumetric energy density is remarkably superior to that of the powder, ∼2.37 GJ/m3 after 30 cycles. The fresh pellets (7.25± 0.64 MPa) and calcined pellets (3.19 ± 0.29 MPa) both possess desirable ability to resist mechanical stress and thermal shock. Therefore, Fe/Mn-doped, dolomite-derived composite pellets are potential candidates for direct solar absorption when applied in CaL-based TCES systems due to their simultaneously desirable spectral absorbance and cycling stability.

Abstract: In order to develop a novel high efficient energy-saving film, Li, Cs co-doped tungsten bronze (LimCsnWO3, m + n = 0.35) nanoparticles with excellent near-infrared (NIR) shielding properties were prepared by a facile solid state reaction method. It has been clarified that Li+-doping can control the crystal growth of CsxWO3, resulting in formation of hexagonal nanorods with high aspect ratio, which is conducive to enhancing the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and improving the NIR shielding performance. The as-prepared LimCsnWO3 films from dispersion of nanoparticles with Li/Cs = 0.2:0.8 could exhibit excellent transparent heat shielding performance with the maximum visible light transmittance 75.18% and NIR shielding rate 97.65%. Moreover, the temperature difference between the outside surface and air in the box for the film glass during the thermal insulation test is 3 times that of ordinary glass. In addition, the regulation mechanism of Li+-doping on the crystal structure and NIR shielding properties were investigated. It is found that the mixed alkali effect in the LimCsnWO3 nanoparticles is favorable for obtaining hexagonal Cs0·32WO3 crystal grains with improved NIR shielding performance and stable crystal structure. This work has great significance for promoting industrial production and practical applications in the field of energy-saving window films.

Abstract: CdTe-based photovoltaic device performance improvement is predominantly limited by open-circuit voltage. This work approaches the voltage deficit challenge through the incorporation of a cadmium magnesium telluride (CdMgTe) electron reflector layer at the back of 1.5- μm CdSeTe/CdTe absorbers to reduce back-surface recombination through a conduction band offset. A sputtered CdMgTe electron reflector layer permitted low fabrication temperatures and circumvented the intolerance of CdMgTe to thermal processing present in traditional close-space sublimation (CSS)-deposited CdMgTe devices. We demonstrate that sputtered CdMgTe simultaneously promotes the retention of chlorine passivation and magnesium which is not feasible with CSS fabrication. We also show the importance of the Cu and Te back contact order in CdMgTe devices. Through the optimization of the sputtered CdMgTe substrate temperature, doping, and back structure configuration, 1.5 μm CdSeTe/CdTe devices with a sputtered CdMgTe layer achieved an efficiency of 16.0%, significantly higher than with CSS CdMgTe, and demonstrated partial enactment of electron-reflector behavior.

Abstract: The study aims to investigate the origin of the crystalline and compositional bi-layered structure of CuIn1-xGaxS2 (CIGS) films we previously observed for samples deposited following the 3-stage process. Therefore, the growth of films of different gallium contents (i.e. x) was interrupted at key steps of the 3-stage, namely at the end of the first stage, after half of the second stage and at the end of third stage. Compositional, morphological and structural differences at each stage were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX). From these investigations, we propose a model attributing composition plateaus to the formation of diverse Cu-poor crystalline phases during the second stage of the growth process.

Abstract: We present strong arguments and experimental findings for the definition of a photovoltaic module accelerated ageing procedure for high irradiance and desert conditions to create a Desert Label for the particular Atacama Desert climatic conditions. A special focus on high ultraviolet solar radiation dosage in combination with either damp heat, salt mist or aggressive thermal cycling are presented. Indoor experimental results, strengthened by outdoor monitoring of sister mini-modules at the Atacama Desert, allowed selecting the appropriate ageing tests while exploring the reliability and durability of a wide range of module configurations, including various typical encapsulants, high efficiency cell technologies and module designs, for industrial applications.

Abstract: For Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) solar cells, swirl-shaped regions in silicon wafers could lead to efficiency degradation, usually accompanied by hot spots and thermal breakdown. In this paper, comprehensive characterization methods including electroluminescence (EL), photo-induced current (LBIC), quantum efficiency (QE), cell efficiency, carrier lifetime, scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) were used to investigate the formation and properties of the Swirl defects. It is found that there exists a strong correlation between the as-grown swirl defects and the degradation in cell performance. The Swirl defects cause an energy level of Ev + 0.33 eV in silicon bandgap, with the capture cross section of 2.3 × 10−15 cm2, which is consistent with the feature of silicon/oxide interface states. The swirl defects can further be evolved into stacking faults after annealing at 1050 °C for 16 h, and cause an additional energy level of Ev + 0.42 eV with the capture cross section is 1.0 × 10−14 cm2. These results suggest that oxygen precipitates are the vital component or precursor for the formation of swirl-shaped regions in Cz silicon wafers.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the influence of Sb2O3 or selenium vacancies (Vse) on the characteristics of Sb2Se3 films, and developed a novel hydrogen-assisted selenization (HAS) scheme aimed at reducing the formation of Sb2O3 and Vse in the absorber layer of Sb2Se3 solar cells. In experiments, subsurface Sb2O3 formation was more pronounced in RF samples than in DC samples. An Sb2Se3 absorber prepared using RF sputtering without HAS converted from p-type conductivity to n-type conductivity, which reduced the JSC values and device efficiency. Furthermore, the Sb2O3 phase that formed on the surface of the Sb2Se3 film acted as a channel for current flow, which greatly increased current leakage at p-n junction interfaces. Our results indicate that the formation of Sb2O3 phase can lead to a Se-poor state, resulting in the formation of VSe defects in the Sb2Se3 absorber layer, with a corresponding decrease in Jsc. The HAS process was shown to reduce the formation of Sb2O3 and Vse in the Sb2Se3 absorber, resulting in device efficiency of 6.16% and Jsc of 27.57 mA/cm2, the highest ever recorded for Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells prepared via sputtering.

Abstract: In order to improve the energy storage performance of polyethylene glycol (PEG), copper sulfide (CuS) was introduced into PEG to endow the function of photo-to-thermal conversion. A series of novel PEG/CuS composite phase change materials (PCMs) were prepared by melt blending method with polyethylene pyrrolidone (PVP) employed as a stabilizer. Results of the dispersion stability experiment and 100 thermal cycles test showed that 2 wt% PVP can effectively improve the stability of PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCMs. And the CuS nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the PEG through physical action with the help of PVP. DSC results showed that the melting enthalpy of PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCM is as high as 171.8 J/g, 164.0 J/g, and 156.2 J/g when the content of CuS is 2 wt%, 6 wt%, and 10 wt%, respectively. Thermal cycling test and TGA results demonstrated that PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCMs have excellent reliability and stability. The photo-absorption property of PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCM increases to the range of 0.44–0.852, 0.938–1.533, 1.335–2.462 respectively within the addition of 2 wt%, 6 wt%, 10 wt% CuS in the radiation range of 300–900 nm. And the photo-to-thermal conversion efficiency of PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCMs was tested up to 87.36%. Therefore, the prepared PEG/PVP/CuS composite PCMs show remarkable potential in solar thermal utilization applications.

Abstract: Electrochemical corrosion of alloy materials is one of the biggest challenges in the development of heat transfer and storage technology by molten salt. Here, the thermodynamic and kinetic properties as well as microstructural characteristics of divalent alloying elements (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ti) in molten MgCl2–NaCl (MN) eutectic are analyzed based on first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations and electrochemical experiments, aiming to reveal corrosion rules of alloy and explain corrosion phenomenon. First, special thermodynamic cycles are designed to calculate the redox potentials of M2+|M couples in molten MN, which are corrected by the experimental potential of Ni2+|Ni reference electrode. Then, ionic/atomic self-diffusion coefficients of molten salt mixtures are evaluated from FPMD simulations, whose credibility is verified by the results from cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. Studies have shown that the oxidation reaction of Ti are both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable, while the reactions of Fe and Cr are advantageous in thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively. Furthermore, the Ni enrichment on the alloy surface is explained by the larger diffusivity of Ni2+ than Ni in molten MN, thereby the deposition order of Ni > Mn > Co is deduced. Last, the dynamic coordination numbers and cage volumes of cation-Cl clusters are captured, where the delayed shuttle of Cl− in molten FeCl2-MN verifies the strongest stability of [FeCl6]4− octahedral structure and the short activation time of Cl− in molten CrCl2-MN results in the fast corrosion rate of Cr.

Abstract: Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) plays important roles in DNA replication, repair and recombination. Herein, we report biochemical characteristics and catalytic mechanism of a novel FEN1 from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Thermococcus barophilus Ch5 (Tb-FEN1). As expected, the recombinant Tb-FEN1 can cleave 5′-flap DNA. However, the enzyme has no activity on cleaving pseudo Y DNA, which sharply contrasts with other archaeal and eukaryotic FEN1 homologs. Tb-FEN1 retains 24% relative activity after heating at 100 °C for 20 min, demonstrating that it is the most thermostable among all reported FEN1 proteins. The enzyme displays maximal activity in a wide range of pH from 7.0 to 9.5. The Tb-FEN1 activity is dependent on a divalent metal ion, among which Mg2+ and Mn2+ are optimal. Enzyme activity is inhibited by NaCl. Kinetic analyzes estimated that an activation energy for removal of 5′-flap from DNA by Tb-FEN1 was 35.7 ± 4.3 kcal/mol, which is the first report on energy barrier for excising 5′-flap from DNA by a FEN1 enzyme. Mutational studies demonstrate that the K87A, R94A and E154A amino acid substitutions abolish cleavage activity and reduce 5′-flap DNA binding efficiencies, suggesting that residues K87, R94, and E154 in Tb-FEN1 are essential for catalysis and DNA binding as well. Overall, Tb-FEN1 is an extremely thermostable endonuclease with unusual features.

Abstract: Cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells have achieved efficiencies of over 22%, despite having absorber layer grain sizes less than 10 μm and hence a very high density of grain boundaries. Recent research has shown that this is possible because of partial passivation of grain boundaries during the widely used cadmium chloride treatment, and passivation of grain interior defects by selenium alloying of the CdTe. Here, state-of-the art TEM-based cathodoluminescence imaging is used to show that, in addition to grain interiors, selenium also passivates grain boundaries in alloyed Cd(Sex,Te1-x) material (CST). Specifically, we find that recombination at CST grain boundaries is up to an order of magnitude lower than at CdTe grain boundaries. This further explains the superior performance of selenium graded CdTe devices and provides potential new routes for further efficiency improvement and solar electricity cost reduction.

Abstract: The defects concentrated at grain boundaries and on film surfaces acts as trap states of charge carriers and trigger points of degradation of perovskite, greatly hampering the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It is highly desirable to fabricate high-quality perovskite polycrystalline films with low grain boundary density and defect density. Herein, a flame retardant phosphaphenanthrene is introduced into the precursor to simultaneously modulate perovskite crystallization and passivate defects of perovskite films. The crystallinity and stability of perovskite films are greatly enhanced owing to strong coordination between the phosphaphenanthrene and Pb2+ and intermolecular interactions. The efficiency of FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 (FA, formamidine and Cs, cesium) PSC with the active area of 0.255 cm2 is significantly increased from 17.95% to 21.13%, along with negligible hysteresis. This facile strategy of employing multifunctional molecules has shown great promise for pursuing efficient and stable FACs-based PSCs.

Abstract: Smart windows that regulate solar irradiation (including ultraviolet UV, visible and infrared) have emerged as an exciting research area for energy conservation, privacy protection and organism healthcare. However, scalable, low cost and robust smart windows with broadband light modulation are still challengeable for practical applications. Here, an integrated smart membrane with capability of managing the light wavelength from UV, visible (Vis) to near infrared (NIR) band via facile spray coating is reported. The smart membrane consists of the upper ITO rich layer, bottom TiO2/SiO2 NPs layer and a bulk elastomeric PDMS as matrix. Due to the NIR reflection and UV absorption, the smart membrane shows high Vis transmittance and moderate UV and NIR transmittance under relaxed state. Due to Mie scattering from vacuum cavity, under stretching (50%), UV, Vis and NIR transmittance could be dramatically decreased from 40% to 5% (380 nm), from 70% to 5% and from 70% to 10%, respectively, indicating highly efficient and sensitive management. In particular, the application in greenhouse exhibits excellent properties in plants protection, IR cooling and privacy preserving. We believe that this work will pave a facile and low-cost approach for a novel class of integrated smart windows via broadband light modulation.

Abstract: Constructing the solar absorber with high omnidirectional absorption has great potential for enhanced solar energy conversion. Although varieties of strategies have been carried out to enhance the solar absorption at the near-normal incidence and achieve the selective solar absorbers (SSAs) with high optical performance, the wide-angle absorber is rarely investigated. Here, we experimentally demonstrated a wide-angle high absorption solar selective absorber configurated with the W–SiO2 cermet-based quasi-optical cavity structure for effective solar harvesting. It can realize a wideband absorption in the wavelength range of 300–1400 nm at the normal incidence, and maintain the average omnidirectional absorption of ∼95% over the incident angle ranges from 8 to 80°, which ascribes to the impedance matching between the absorber and the free space at a large incident angle. The SSA also demonstrates a large solar absorption of around 70% at the incident angle of 80°. A remarkable temperature increase of ∼40 °C relative to ambient temperature was achieved for the SSA directly exposed to the outdoor sunshine without solar concentration in the subtropical city of Shenzhen.

Abstract: We conduct numerical device simulations to study to what extend poly-Si on oxide (POLO)2 IBC solar cells can be optimized. In particular, we evaluate the benefit of the concept of photonic crystals (PCs) for “standard” cell thicknesses compatible with industrial wafer handling. We find that for our current surface passivation quality, implementing PCs and decreasing the wafer thickness down to 15 μm would increase the efficiency by „only“ 1% absolute due to limiting surface recombination losses. We deduce a high c-Si/SiOx interface state density Dit of 2.9 × 1012 eV−1cm−2 by analyzing special two-terminal IV measurements on small pads that contact the intact interfacial oxide between pinholes with our MarcoPOLO model. Consequently, we improve the hydrogenation process of our POLO junctions by an Al2O3/SiNx/Al2O3 rear-side dielectric layer stack. For n-type POLO (p-type POLO) J0 is reduced from 4 (10) fA/cm2 down to 0.5 ± 0.3 (3.3 ± 0.7) fA/cm2. For this improved surface passivation, our numerical device simulations predict an efficiency potential of 29.1% (27.8%) for POLO2 IBC cells with (without) PCs for a standard thickness of 150 μm. This shows that the “practical limit” for Si solar cells with poly-Si on oxide-based passivating contact schemes is above 27%, and, in general, that the efficiency potential of Si single-junction cells is still far from being exhausted. The first implementation of the improved POLO junctions into cell precursors confirms the predicted improvement on the level of suns - implied open-circuit voltage curves.

Abstract: At present, conventional micron-pyramid texture is imperfect for further reducing optical reflection loss and improving photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) solar cells. Herein, reactive ion etching technique is used to fabricate nanopores on top of pre-formed micron-pyramid silicon surface, called NPP structure. The equivalent medium layer with graded refractive index appeared on NPP textures makes the absorption of almost all incident light independent of the wavelength and angle. However, serious Auger recombination and surface recombination associated with NPP structure is detrimental to emitter passivation, usually counteracting the photocurrent gain. To identify an appropriate balance of light-trapping and surface passivation, we investigate the impact of different radio-frequency power (PRF) on the optical and electrical properties of TOPCon solar cells and discusses the underlying structural causes behind these observed improvements. Finally, we demonstrate NPP TOPCon solar cells with an average short-circuit current density of 41.44 mA/cm2 and an average PCE of 23.55% at the PRF of 600 W. Besides, the external quantum efficiency results under various incident angles from 0° to 70° exhibited excellent wide-angle spectral absorption capability, which is significant for solar cells working in an outdoor environment.

Abstract: The excellent thermal storage and photothermal conversion performance are of significance for the microencapsulated phase change materials (MicroPCMs) in solar energy storage applications. Herein, the hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (HO-CNTs) modified MicroPCMs with n-hexadecanol core and melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin shell were successfully fabricated via in-situ polymerization, where the effect of dosing amounts of HO-CNTs on the thermal properties of MicroPCMs was investigated. The micromorphology shows that the introduction of HO-CNTs has little influence on the spherical structure of MicroPCMs with compact shell. At the 0.2 wt% dosage of HO-CNTs, the melting temperature and latent heat of MicroPCMs are 51.5 °C and 181.5 J g−1, respectively, and the energy storage efficiency of n-hexadecanol is calculated to be 75.25%. It is noteworthy that with the increase of HO-CNTs dosage, the prepared MicroPCMs exhibit prominent improvement in the thermal conductivity and photothermal conversion performance, being conducive to enhancing photothermal storage efficiency. The thermal conductivity of MicroPCMs is as high as 0.3598 W m−1 K−1 with the dosing amount of 0.6 wt% HO-CNTs. Additionally, all the modified MicroPCMs possess distinguished thermal reliability during the 500 thermal cycles. The results suggest that the developed MicroPCMs with high thermal storage capacity and excellent photothermal conversion performance have a great potential application in the direct absorption solar collector system (DASC) for solar energy storage.

Abstract: Extracting the parameters, energy level and electron-to-hole capture cross-section ratio, of efficiency-limiting bulk defects in silicon solar cells is a critical step in identifying those defects and potentially eliminating their impact. Typically, this is achieved on specially prepared test structures. However, in some cases, this is not possible, especially in mass production lines when only completed solar cells are available. In this study, a method that is based on temperature-dependent Suns-Voc measurements is introduced to extract the defect parameters in metalized solar cells. The method is validated by comparing the parameters of the boron-oxygen-related defect extracted from cells and those extracted from wafers using the commonly used temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy. It is shown that this method has the benefit of a more accurate lifetime at low injection levels compared with photoconductance-based lifetime measurement since it is not impacted by minority carrier traps. The proposed technique is then applied to determine the parameters of the defect causing light-induced degradation in gallium-doped silicon solar cells. We determined an energy level, with respect to the intrinsic level, of −0.26 ± 0.04 eV and a capture cross-section ratio of 34 ± 2 for this defect. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed by considering the system’s limited measurement temperature range. The findings demonstrate the potential of the temperature-dependent Suns-Voc method as a fast and easy-to-apply method for defect characterization in metalized cells.

Abstract: Tin monosulfide (SnS) is a promising light-harvesting material for solar cell applications, owing to its potential for large-scale production, cost-effectiveness, eco-friendly source materials, and long-term stability. However, SnS crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure, which results in a highly anisotropic charge transport behavior. Tailoring the crystallographic orientation of the SnS absorber layer plays a critical role in the enhancement of the transfer of charge carriers and the power conversion efficiency (PCE). By controlling the substrate tilting angle and temperature ramp rate in vapor transport deposition, the crystal growth orientation was tuned to a preferred direction which significantly suppressed the unfavorable (040) crystallographic plane. Through the combination of these two approaches, the PCE could be increased from 0.11% to 2%. The effect of the tilting angle was numerically simulated to investigate its role in controlling the film uniformity and directing the film growth. In addition, the correlation between the texture coefficient of the (040) plane and the charge transport properties was determined by a combination of analytical methods such as device performance studies, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, along with transient photovoltage, space-charge-limited current, and dark current measurements. These techniques were blended together to prove that the marked improvement in PCE can be ascribed to a reduced charge recombination (in both SnS bulk and interfaces) and an enhanced hole mobility.

Abstract: Background & Aims
Hepatic stellate cells activation is the key process of liver fibrosis, revealing the molecular mechanism of which is helpful to provide an effective target for inhibiting liver fibrosis. Rab31, a small GTPase, regulates the specificity of intracellular vesicular transport system, and is crucial for signal transduction. However, whether Rab31 is involved in hepatic stellate cells activation is unknown.
Methods & Results
Analysis of the differences in gene expression between human healthy and fibrotic liver tissues by sequencing revealed that Rab31 was significantly upregulated in fibrotic tissues. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that Rab31 positively correlated with hepatic fibrosis. Next, mouse primary hepatic stellate cells were prepared, and their continuous activation was accompanied by Rab31 expression increased. Interestingly, knockdown of Rab31 by lentivirus can significantly restrict those cell activation. Subsequently, the vary of signal transduction after Rab31 knockdown was detected, its presented that the TGF-β/Smads signaling was obviously affected. Following experiments identified that Rab31 knockdown significantly inhibited the TGF-β activation and led to the failure of hepatic stellate cells activation. Importantly, we revealed that Rab31 knockdown could inhibit TGF-β receptor II complex endocytosis, a prerequisite for the activation of TGF-β signaling. Finally, in a mouse CCl4 fibrosis model, we proved that Rab31 knockdown markedly inhibited hepatic fibrosis.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that Rab31 could promote hepatic stellate cells activation by accelerating TGF-β Receptor II complex endocytosis, suggesting that interfering with Rab31 could be an effectively strategy to inhibit hepatic fibrosis progression.

Abstract: This paper discusses the environmental stability of an electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) applied to shingled photovoltaic (PV) modules. This study aims to verify the degradation behavior of ECA joints when shingled PV modules are exposed to an accelerated aging test under hot and humid environmental conditions. To achieve this, we prepared shingled PV modules through an assembly process wherein five pre-cut crystalline silicon solar cells were bonded with a ECA paste cured by an infrared lamp, and then stored under damp heat (85 °C/85% RH) and high temperature (65 and 85 °C) conditions. To confirm the aging of the ECA, we determined the changes in the electrical resistance of the ECA and in the efficiencies of the shingled PV modules. Results suggest that the electrical properties of the ECA did not deteriorate under heat and moisture conditions, while the performance of the shingled modules degraded under the same conditions. It was confirmed that the degradation in performance was mainly due to a drop in the fill factor (FF) caused by current leakage. Physicochemical analyses of the samples revealed that Ag atoms, which diffused from the ECA joint to the Si wafer, acted as the shunt path for the solar cell. The bonding properties of the ECA joint to moisture were evaluated as well.

Abstract: Accessibility to freshwater has become a global issue and many approaches have been developed to tackle this question. One promising way is using radiative coolers to condense dew from the air. This study aims to quantify systematically the effects of droplet diameters, spacial distribution, projected surface coverage ratio, and surface wettabilities on the normal-hemispherical transmittance and cooling performance. The Monte Carlo ray tracing method is employed to simulate the infrared light transfer through the droplets. For the first time, the normal-hemispherical transmittance and cooling performance of radiative cooler with different droplet contact angles were investigated theoretically. The weighted transmittance is found to be independent of droplet spacial distribution, but dependent on droplet (i)diameter, (ii)projected surface coverage ratio, and (iii)contact angle. Results show that the water condensed on the emitting surface can improve the cooling power. A super-hydrophilic PDMS film with a 90% projected surface coverage ratio can reach a cooling power of 109.3 W m−2. In the process of water condensation, a cooling power loss of up to 23.4 W m−2 will appear due to surface wettability, so super-hydrophilic surfaces are preferred. These results provide guidance on surface wettability preference for better performance of radiative cooler for direct water condensation.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies show that higher circulating levels of odd chain saturated fatty acids (FA: C15:0 and C17:0) are associated with lower risk of metabolic disease. These odd chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) are produced by α-oxidation in peroxisomes, de novo lipogenesis, from the diet and by gut microbiota. Although present at low concentrations, they are of interest as potential targets to reduce metabolic disease risk. To determine whether OCSFA are affected by obesogenic diets, we have investigated whether high dietary fat intake affects the frequency of OCSFA-producing gut microbiota, liver lipid metabolism genes and circulating OCSFA. FA concentrations were determined in liver and serum from pathogen-free SPF C57BL/6 J mice fed either standard chow or a high fat diet (HFD; 60% calories as fat) for four and twelve weeks. Post-mortem mouse livers were analysed histologically for fat deposition by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for FA composition and by qPCR for the lipid metabolic genes fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), elongation of long-chain fatty acids family member 6 (ELOVL6) and 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 (HACL). Gut microbiota in faecal pellets from the ileum were analysed by 16S RNA sequencing. A significant depletion of serum and liver C15:0 (>50%; P < 0.05) and liver C17:0 (>35%; P < 0.05) was observed in HFD-fed SPF mice in parallel with hepatic fat accumulation after four weeks. In addition, liver gene expression (HACL1, ELOVL6, SCD1 and FADS2) was lower (>50%; P < 0.05) and the relative abundance of beneficial C3:0-producing gut bacteria such as Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium was lower after HFD in SPF mice. In summary, high dietary fat intake reduces serum and liver OCSFA, OCSFA-producing gut microbiota and is associated with impaired liver lipid metabolism. Further studies are required to identify whether there is any beneficial effect of OCSFA and C3:0-producing gut bacteria to counter metabolic disease.

Abstract: Emerging PEG/VO2 dual phase change materials (PCM) with phase transition temperature gradients were prepared with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and vanadium dioxide (VO2) through the vacuum impregnation method. To improve the stability, thermal conductivity, and thermal storage capacity of PEG/VO2, expanded graphite (EG) with different mass gradients was introduced. PEG was successfully confined as 54.48, 63.91, and 74.31 wt% in the dual composite phase change materials including 2.60, 3.28, and 3.32 wt% EG, respectively. The chemical composition and microstructure characteristics of the composite phase change material were measured by XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The thermal storage capacity of 70–113 J g−1 and phase transition temperature range of 30–70 °C for PEG/VO2/EG were determined by DSC. Moreover, compared with pure PEG, the thermal conductivity of PEG/VO2/EG0.10 was increased by up to 93.75%, and the thermal storage capacity was increased by up to 59.35% compared with PEG/VO2. Compared to pure PCM, due to the improvement of thermal conductivity, the response to ambient temperature was also significantly shortened. The thermal cycling stability and thermal durability were demonstrated by the thermal cycle test and TG. Besides, PEG/VO2/EG0.10 was used to simulate the thermal management of lithium-ion battery, indicating that the material had certain advantages in cooling and could improve the safety of the battery during use. PEG/VO2/EG0.10 has good application potential in the field of thermal management due to the unique dual phase transition interval.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the sixth highly diagnosed cancer and the fourth main reason of cancer deaths worldwide. HuaChanSu, an extract from dried toad skin, exhibits good anticancer effects and has been widely used in the treatment of liver cancer. The reprogramming of glucose metabolism is one remarkable feature of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the effects of HuaChanSu on the abnormal glucose metabolism of cancer cells have not been elucidated. In our study, we investigate the effects of HuaChanSu on glucose metabolism of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and tumor growth in vivo. The results show that HuaChanSu inhibits the tumor growth of hepatoma H22-bearing mice and prolongs the survival time of tumor-bearing mice, additionally, HuaChanSu has no obvious adverse effects in these mice. In vitro, HuaChanSu restrains the proliferation, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of human hepatoma cells. HuaChanSu also promotes ROS production and causes mitochondrial damage. Furthermore, HuaChanSu inhibits glucose uptake and lactate release in human hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, we find that HuaChanSu downregulates Hexokinase-2 (HK2) expression, and using RNA interference, we confirm that HuaChanSu suppresses the growth of HepG2 cells by interfering with glucose metabolism through downregulation of Hexokinase-2. However, knockdown of Hexokinase-2 has no obvious effect on the proliferation of SK-HEP-1 cells, although glucose uptake and lactate release are reduced in siHK2-transfected SK-HEP-1 cells, subsequently, we illustrate that two human hepatoma cell lines exhibit glucose metabolism heterogeneity, which causes the different cell proliferation responses to the inhibition of Hexokinase-2. Taken together, our study indicates that HuaChanSu could inhibit tumor growth and interfere with glucose metabolism via suppression of Hexokinase-2, and these findings provide a new insight into the anti-hepatoma mechanisms of HuaChanSu and lay a theoretical foundation for the further clinical application of HuaChanSu.

Abstract: Calcium-looping thermochemical energy storage is a promising candidate in concentrated solar power plants. Solar-driven calcium-looping process via directly capturing sunlight can solve the challenges faced by traditional calcium-looping system, such as excessively high wall temperature, large thermal resistance, and low utilization efficiency of solar energy. In this work, we aim to improve optical absorption and cyclic stability of the direct solar-driven calcium-looping process with modified calcium-based materials for thermochemical energy storage. A simple sol-gel method was used to synthesize calcium-based composites via multi-doping strategy and the doping elements mainly included cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), and manganese (Mn). Firstly, the role of calcium-based materials using single-doping element on the performance of thermochemical energy storage was revealed. The doping of Ce alone could generate oxygen vacancies and increase the adsorbed ability of CO2, accelerating the carbonization kinetics of CaO. The doping of Co alone played an important role in enhancing optical absorption while the doping of Mn alone was beneficial to cycling stability via providing a strong framework to inhibit sintering effect. Calcium-based materials using multi-doping strategy retained the function of single-doping effect on the performance of calcium-looping thermochemical energy storage, synergistically improving optical absorption, carbonization kinetics, and cyclic stability. Compared to pure CaCO3, Ce/Co/Mn co-doped Ca-based materials (CaCO3/5Ce–3Co–6Mn) exhibited a higher light trapping ability with optical absorption reached to 83.26% and more excellent cycling stability with effective conversion rate remained above 64% after 20 cycles. Furthermore, an interesting phenomenon that phase transformation of doped metal oxides formed by multi-doping strategy occurred during the calcination/carbonation cycling process was discovered and the underlying mechanisms were clarified. Finally, the feasibility of experiment by directly capturing concentrated sunlight to drive CaCO3 decomposition for storing solar energy was verified.

Abstract: Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have important application in building integrated photovoltaic. CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals possessing tunable band gap energies, large absorption coefficients, narrow band photoluminescence (PL), and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY), have great potential application in LSCs. However, instability of perovskite nanocrystals in ambient environment still limits their practical application. Herein, as a proof-of-concept experiment, CsPbBr3 nanocrystal-embedded glass sheets with various geometric factors are investigated as LSCs. Due to the wide absorption spectral range, high PL QY, and narrow PL, optical efficiency of 6.17% (2 × 2 cm2) is achieved from LSCs based on CsPbBr3 nanocrystal-embedded glass sheets. Importantly, the stability tests show that the glass matrix can effectively protect CsPbBr3 nanocrystals from eroding of ambient environment. These results show that CsPbBr3 nanocrystal-embedded glasses are promising materials for LSCs.

Abstract: In this work, we report a cracking mechanism occurring on shingle solar cells in PV modules subjected to thermal cycling. Experimental investigations of six different ECAs show that the positions of cracks are precisely limited to the applied ECA in the joint and the occurrence confined to the rear side of the solar cells. Structural mechanic simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) obtain maximum stresses of up to 400MPa on the rear surface of the solar cell orientated towards the back sheet. On the opposing surface, orientated towards the glass, the stresses are on a far lower level at around 230MPa. We measured the characteristic fracture stresses and found values of 96MPa on the rear and 265MPa on the front side of the separated shingle solar cells. The lower values on the rear originate from microfractures at the solar cell edges caused by the laser scribe and mechanical cleave process. We discuss two mechanisms taking place at the shingle joint during cooling from lamination temperature at 160°C to −40°C. First a relative shift of the solar cells caused by a mismatch in the thermal expansion in y-direction. Second a mismatch in thermal expansion in z-direction. We apply an anisotropic thermal expansion behavior in our simulations to separate both mechanisms and reveal the driving mechanism behind crack formation. We find that the cracks are caused by thermal contraction of the encapsulant in z-direction. Transversal contraction of the encapsulant causes additional strain in z-direction.

Abstract: Ultrathin (20 nm) epitaxial films of germanium are deposited on crystalline silicon wafers, to act as virtual substrates for the growth of III-V materials, opening a low-cost approach to tandem solar cells. Such ultrathin layers allow for material cost reduction, along with the possibility of using the silicon wafer as the bottom cell in tandem devices. A simple plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process at 175 °C has been optimized to deposit these heteroepitaxial germanium films, which grow directly on the silicon wafers without any intermediate silicon-germanium alloy. Thanks to an in-situ plasma cleaning step prior to Ge epitaxy, the films can sustain high-temperature annealing in vacuum (up to 800 °C) without any delamination. The suitability of the germanium heteroepitaxial films as virtual substrates is analyzed by depositing III-V layers on them by conventional growth methods like chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The properties of the GaAs films deposited on the virtual substrates are comparable in terms of roughness, microstructure, and crystallinity to these of the III-V layers co-deposited on c-Ge wafers, pointing at the effectiveness of the ultrathin c-Ge epitaxial layers to act as virtual substrates for III-V epitaxial growth. Moreover, growing the c-Ge layers on c-Si substrates with 5° miscut avoids the formation of antiphase domains. These substrates are finally used to demonstrate proof of concept tandem solar cells, proving the suitability of our low temperature and ultrathin virtual substrate approach.

Abstract: The morphology and optoelectronic properties of wide-bandgap halide perovskites have profound influence on the performance of tandem solar cells in which these materials hold a great potential to push the efficiency beyond the maximum in single junction devices. Typically, alkali metals such as Cs+ are employed to overcome photo-instability in mixed-halide hybrid perovskites. However, while using the popular CsI in precursor solutions, small grain size (~250 nm) along with high densities of grain boundaries and their associated trap states are usually observed in polycrystalline films, leading to low photovoltaic performance. Here, we develop a non-stoichiometric one-step solution casting method to prepare wide-bandgap CsXMA1-XPb(I0·6Br0.4)3 films with reduced grain boundaries and high crystallinity using CsCl which plays a double role of Cs + source and crystallization controller. The resulting films exhibit improved carrier lifetime and mobility, and reduced carrier trap states. Elemental analysis revealed that some Cl ions remains in the final films, passivating the defect states. All these benefits led to high open circuit voltages and improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cs0.1MA0.9Pb(I0·6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cells from 13.20% to 15.16%. Moreover, the developed method is also found to enhance the hydrophobicity and moisture resistance of CsXMA1-XPb(I0·6Br0.4)3 films, which enabled the improvement in the device ambient stability.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) reactions have attractive advantages compared with heat storage methods, such as extremely high energy storage densities (1440 and 3960 MJ m−3), no heat loss, and good transportability. In this study, a thermochemical reactor with gradient porosity using magnesium-based materials is designed. To study the functions and characteristics of thermochemical storage reactors, the related key parameters, such as velocity, temperature, conversion degree, conversion rate, and power, are analysed for the reaction space and heat transfer fluid (HTF) channel. In the heat release process, the highest temperature was 322 °C, and the duration times of the reaction were approximately 360 min, 200 min, 180 min and 75 min for different positions. Compared with the same-porosity condition, the maximum pressure in the gradient-porosity reactor was much lower. The maximum pressure was approximately 1.15 atm, 1.98 atm, 4.1 atm and 6.9 atm with different mixed steam flow rates, and the total power in the reaction process was approximately 190 W. In the HTF channel, the highest temperature was 295 °C, and it remained consistent for 250–270 min. The present model provides a valuable reference for practical engineering applications.

Abstract: There is currently an ever-increasing demand for higher process efficiencies in next generation (Gen3) concentrating solar power (CSP). Higher process efficiencies may be procured by increasing the operating temperature, and simultaneously, minimizing the degradation of materials used for construction of CSP plants (e.g., piping, thermal storage tanks, solar receivers and heat exchangers). Thus, understanding materials corrosion in the presence of molten salt mixtures used as thermal energy storage media and heat transfer fluids is indispensable for CSP development. The present paper provides insights into the effects of salt purification on the corrosion of a nickel-based alloy (Haynes 230) isothermally exposed to a stagnant chloride-based salt mixture at 800 °C. The MgCl2-based salt mixture was thermally dehydrated and chemically treated with (0.1 and 0.5 wt %) elemental magnesium. Results reveal the electrochemical nature of the corrosion process, and the formation of corrosion products such as oxides (MgO, MgCr2O4, and MgAl2O4) and nitrides (CrN) on the alloy surface and in sub-surface regions. Magnesium additions enhanced the ability to resist corrosion by reducing the concentration of impurities (H2O, MgOH+, OH− species) and polarizing the alloy surface. The formation of nitrides in all cases studied indicates the impact of using nitrogen as a protective gas in the system. Results also reveal that a single step treatment of the salt using metallic Mg could be considered as a measure to control the salt's impurity level, e.g., if required for system control.

Abstract: Converting abundant solar energy into latent heat stored by organic phase change materials (PCMs) can effectively overcome the intermittency and instability of solar irradiation and improve energy utilization efficiency. However, facile fabrication of form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) to realize simultaneously energetic solar-thermal conversion and storage in broad-scale practical applications remain a formidable challenge. Here we offer an appealing solar-thermal energy conversion and storage system that utilizes paraffin (PW) as latent heat storage units, sulfur treated nickel foams (S–Ni foams) as solar-thermal conversion materials and polynorbornene-based bottlebrush polymers (PNb22C) as gelators, which can self-assemble into 3D supporting scaffolds, to confine the paraffin in small nanometer-scale spacing. Novel FSPCMs demonstrate no paraffin leakage, high latent heat storage capacity (172.1 J/g) and ultra-stable thermal cycling durability during the 500 times thermal cycling tests. In addition, owning to powerful solar-thermal conversion of S–Ni foams, the developed FSPCMs can energetically convert solar energy into latent heat storing by paraffin with reversible solar-thermal energy storage and release during the 200 cycling tests, providing universal potential opportunities for practical applications in solar energy utilization system, etc.

Abstract: Randomly distributed subwavelength structures (SWSs) have been fabricated on one side of borosilicate glass samples using one-step self-masking reactive ion etching (RIE) process. These samples have been optically and topologically characterized by means of a spectrophotometer and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The random SWSs exhibit excellent broadband anti-reflective properties from the ultraviolet to the near infrared spectral region, showing a relative reflectance decrease of 2.9%, averaged between 300 nm and 1200 nm. This reflectance reduction resulted from a gradual refractive index change from air to the glass substrate which, effectively suppressed Fresnel reflection, as described by the effective medium theory. In addition, these SWSs have been modelled and the influence of their main topological parameters on the anti-reflective response has been analysed using rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method-based simulation tool. Nanostructure’s average height, height distribution, randomness and geometry have been varied, and the acquired omnidirectional behaviour has been analysed and compared between each other as a way to choose the best SWS. Moreover, to analyse the possible photovoltaic application of these structured glasses, the theoretical photo-generated short circuit current density has been calculated for the best SWS studied. The obtained theoretical results have been consistent with the experimentally obtained data validating the presented model.

Abstract: The scaffold protein Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2) has been reported to play a key role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and hence autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process, whose dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. We investigated the involvement of TRAF2 in autophagy regulation in the human leukemic HAP1 cell line, under both basal and ER stress conditions. In TRAF2-knockout HAP1 cell line (KO), the basal autophagic flux was higher than in the parental cell line (WT). Moreover, tunicamycin-induced ER stress stimulated JNK activation and autophagy both in WT and KO HAP1. On the other hand, re-expression of a TRAF2 C-terminal fragment (residues ,310–501), in a TRAF2-KO cellular background, rendered HAP1 cells unable to activate both JNK and autophagy upon ER stress induction. Of note, this apparent dominant negative effect of the C-terminal fragment was observed even in the absence of the endogenous, full-length TRAF2 molecule. Furthermore, the expression of the C-terminal fragment resulted in both protein kinase B (AKT) pathway activation and increased resistance to the toxic effects induced by prolonged ER stress conditions. These findings indicate that TRAF2 is dispensable for the activation of both JNK and autophagy in HAP1 cells, while the TRAF2 C-terminal domain may play an autonomous role in regulating the cellular response to ER stress.

Abstract: WDR62 (WD40-repeat protein 62) participates in diverse biological process, especially mitotic spindle organization via regulating centriole biogenesis and the function of centriole-associated protein. However, the role of WDR62 exerts in spindle assembly and meiotic progression control in oocytes lacking typical centrosomes remains obscure. In a previous study, we reported that WDR62 is involved in spindle migration and asymmetric cytokinesis in mouse oocyte meiosis. In the current study, another novel function of WDR62 regulating cell cycle progression through meiotic spindle formation during oocyte meiotic maturation was found. Knockdown of WDR62 through siRNA microinjection disrupted the meiotic cell cycle and induced metaphase-I (MI) arrest coupled with severe spindle abnormality, chromosome misalignment, and aneuploid generation. Moreover, WDR62 depletion induced defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-MT) and activated spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which could trigger the arrest of meiotic progression. Further study demonstrated that depletion of WDR62 was associated with an aberrant location of p-JNK and reduced its expression level; concomitantly, status of H3K9 trimethylation was also altered. In addition, phenotypes similar to WDR62 depletion were observed during the function-loss analysis of p-JNK using a specific inhibitor (SP600125), which signifies that WDR62 is important for spindle organization and meiotic progression, and this function might be via its regulation of p-JNK. In conclusion, this study revealed that WDR62 functions in multiple ways during oocyte meiotic maturation, which could be related to p-JNK and H3K9 trimethylation.

Abstract: Chemotherapy resistance is that the most important reason behind of carcinoma treatment failure but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Members of the tripartite motifcontaining protein (TRIM) family play crucial roles in the carcinogenesis and development of resistance against chemotherapy. Herein, we first confirmed that TRIM58 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer tissues and drug-resistant MCF7/ADR cells. Furthermore, TRIM58 knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity of MCF7/ADR cells toward doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, TRIM58 overexpression in breast cancer cells increased doxorubicin resistance. TRIM58 was found to interact with DDX3, a protein recently reported to modulate resistance against chemotherapy. We found that TRIM58 negatively regulates DDX3 expression downstream of the P53/P21 pathway, and that DDX3 is degraded by TRIM58-mediated ubiquitination. Knockdown of DDX3 reversed doxorubicin chemotherapy sensitivity induced by TRIM58 knockdown via the P53/P21 pathway.Our study reveals that TRIM58 mediates a novel mechanism underlying the development of resistance against chemotherapy in breast cancer and provides potential targets for developing novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

Abstract: TeO2–Bi2O3–ZnO–Li2O–MgO lead-free glass was synthesized based on the consideration of environmental protection and the demand for further conversion efficiency improvement. Reactivity of Bi2O3 powder with SiNx and Si as well as lead-free glass with SiNx and Si was investigated using differential thermal analysis. DSC curves show that Bi2O3 doesn't react with SiNx or Si under 800 °C, whereas lead-free glass can react with SiNx and Si at approximately 600 °C indicating early softening and melting of glass facilitates the reaction between Bi2O3 and SiNx or Si. The flowing behavior of lead-free glass at varied temperatures was studied and the morphology of the interface between the glass and the silicon wafer was examined. The white particles formed above silicon were identified as Bi–Te alloy or BiTeOx through stoichiometrically calculating. However, their formation was suppressed by the addition of silver powder. Ag crystallites and Ag particles start to generate on the interface, as the content of silver powder was increased to 8 wt%. These Ag particles and Ag crystallites were observed on the interface in the finished solar cell.

Abstract: Chensinin-1b and its lipoanalogs demonstrate different anticancer activities against selected cancer cells, and the anticancer activity of PA-C1b is improved up to 3-fold compared with that of the parent peptide chensinin-1b. However, detailing the mechanism of action of these peptides is required to better understand the structure-function relationship. In this study, chensinin-1b and PA-C1b were selected as the representative peptides to investigate the mode of action in cancer cells. The results indicated that the boundary of the cell membrane was broken when the cells were treated with chensinin-1b, while that of cells treated with PA-C1b remained intact based on morphological changes. Apoptosis assays indicated that PA-C1b induced MCF-7 cancer cell apoptosis, while chensinin-1b mainly damaged the cell membrane. MCF-7 cancer cells treated with the peptides induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c was released from mitochondria, but PA-C1b enhanced ROS generation. Additionally, PA-C1b uptake occurred via an energy-dependent pathway and was inhibited by selected endocytosis inhibitors. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with PA-C1b suppressed Bcl-2 mRNA levels and increased Bax mRNA levels, upregulated the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and downregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results indicate that the anticancer mechanism of AMPs may be considerably affected by only a slight difference in the hydrophobicity of the two peptides; and such a study may facilitate the design of novel peptide-based anticancer agents.

Abstract: Color tuning remains one of the main issues for electrochromic applications. Multicolored organic and inorganic electrochromic materials have been largely studied. Herein, a novel approach of color modulation is investigated: the electrolyte coloration. The color tuning is therefore not only due to electrochromic materials but addressed thanks to pigment addition in the electrolyte, which allows endless possibilities. A symmetrical PEDOT:PSS based display and a WO3//V2O5 display were elaborated in order to characterize this coloration process. The PEGDMA/PEGMA copolymer gel electrolyte was processed by thermal polymerization using AIBN and colored using four different pigments. Similar switching times and capacities were measured from one colored electrolyte to another. This easy to set up method multiplies the achievable colors without altering electrochromic device stability.

Abstract: Solar Thermophotovoltaics (STPV) has garnered great attention due to the pronounced energy transfer efficiency through a proper spectral transformation with respect to the bandgap of PV cells. In this work, we demonstrate a spectrally selective thermal emitter enabled by optical Tamm state (OTS) in a one-dimensional photonic structure, which is HfO2 and SiO2 layers alternatively stacked on a Mo substrate. The as-prepared emitter achieves a maximal simulated thermal emissivity up to 0.97, bandwidth down to 48 nm at 1.9 μm. The overall system efficiency of the proposed emitter-based STPV device is evaluated, which is up to 33.7% under the solar concentration of 2500 and area ratio of 20, providing a potential route towards the utilization of OTS-based emitters in practical STPV systems.
