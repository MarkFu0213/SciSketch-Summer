Abstract: Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant that induces deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. The inducible heat shock protein (HspA1A) can function as a molecular chaperone; however, its role in DNA repair remains largely unknown. In the present study, human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) stably transfected with plasmids carrying HspA1A gene or shRNAs against HspA1A were treated with BaP. DNA damage levels of the cells were evaluated by comet assay. Results suggest that HspA1A could protect cells against DNA damage and facilitate the decrease of DNA damage levels during the first 2 h of DNA repair. DNA repair capacity (DRC) of Benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts was evaluated by host cell reactivation assay in the stable 16HBE cells transfected with luciferase reporter vector PCMVluc pretreated with BPDE. Compared with control cells, cells overexpressing HspA1A showed higher DRC (p < 0.01 at 10μm BPDE and p < 0.05 at 20μm BPDE, respectively), while knockdown of HspA1A inhibited DNA repair (p < 0.05 at 10μm BPDE). Moreover, casein kinase 2 (CK2) was shown to interact with HspA1A by mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The two proteins were co-localized in the cell nucleus and perinuclear region during DNA repair, and were identified by confocal laser scanning microscope. In addition, cells overexpressing HspA1A showed an increased CK2 activity after BaP treatment compared with control cells (p < 0.01). Our results suggest that HspA1A facilitates DNA repair after BaP treatment. HspA1A also interacts with CK2 and enhances the kinase activities of CK2 during DNA repair.

Abstract: The Eph and Ephrin proteins, which constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are involved in normal tissue development and cancer progression. Here, we examined the expression and role of the B-type Eph receptor EphB2 in breast cancers. By immunohistochemistry using a progression tissue microarray of human clinical samples, we found EphB2 to be expressed in benign tissues, but strongly increased in cancers particularly in invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Subsequently, we found evidence that EphB2, whose expression varies in established cell breast lines, possesses multiple functions. First, the use of a DOX-inducible system to restore EphB2 function to low expressers resulted in decreased tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, while its siRNA-mediated silencing in high expressers increased growth. This function involves the onset of apoptotic death paralleled by caspases 3 and 9 activation. Second, EphB2 was also found to induce autophagy, as assessed by immunofluorescence and/or immunoblotting examination of the LC3, ATG5 and ATG12 markers. Third, EphB2 also has a pro-invasive function in breast cancer cells that involves the regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 metalloproteases and can be blocked by treatment with respective neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, EphB2-induced invasion is kinase-dependent and is impeded in cells expressing a kinase-dead mutant EphB2. In summary, we identified a mechanism involving a triple role for EphB2 in breast cancer progression, whereby it regulates apoptosis, autophagy, and invasion.

Abstract: Bone marrow (BM) could serve as a source of cells facilitating liver repopulation in case of hepatic damage. Currently available hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilizing agents, were comparatively tested for healing potential in liver fibrosis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-injured mice previously reconstituted with Green Fluorescent Protein BM were mobilized with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), Plerixafor or G-CSF+Plerixafor. Hepatic fibrosis, stellate cell activation and oval stem cell frequency were measured by Gomori and by immunohistochemistry for a-Smooth Muscle Actin and Cytokeratin-19, respectively. Angiogenesis was evaluated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of liver Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis-alpha (TNFα). BM-derived cells were tracked by double immunofluorescence. The spontaneous migration of mobilized HSCs towards injured liver and its cytokine secretion profile was determined in transwell culture systems. Either single-agent mobilization or the combination of agents significantly ameliorated hepatic damage by decreasing fibrosis and restoring the abnormal vascular network in the liver of mobilized mice compared to CCl4-only mice. The degree of fibrosis reduction was similar among all mobilized mice despite that G-CSF+Plerixafor yielded significantly higher numbers of circulating HSCs over other agents. The liver homing potential of variously mobilized HSCs differed among the agents. An extended G-CSF treatment provided the highest anti-fibrotic effect over all tested modalities, induced by the proliferation of hepatic stem cells and decreased hepatic inflammation. Plerixafor-mobilized HSCs, despite their reduced liver homing potential, reversed fibrosis mainly by increasing hepatic PPAR-γ and VEGF expression. In all groups, BM-derived mature hepatocytes as well as liver-committed BM stem cells were detected only at low frequencies, further supporting the concept that alternative mechanisms rather than direct HSC effects regulate liver recovery. Overall, our data suggest that G-CSF, Plerixafor and G-CSF+Plerixafor act differentially during the wound healing process, ultimately providing a potent anti-fibrotic effect.

Abstract: Lamin proteins are found in all metazoans. Most non-vertebrate genomes including those of the closest relatives of vertebrates, the cephalochordates and tunicates, encode only a single lamin. In teleosts and tetrapods the number of lamin genes has quadrupled. They can be divided into four sub-types, lmnb1, lmnb2, LIII, and lmna, each characterized by particular features and functional differentiations. Little is known when during vertebrate evolution these features have emerged. Lampreys belong to the Agnatha, the sister group of the Gnathostomata. They split off first within the vertebrate lineage. Analysis of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) lamin complement presented here, identified three functional lamin genes, one encoding a lamin LIII, indicating that the characteristic gene structure of this subtype had been established prior to the agnathan/gnathostome split. Two other genes encode lamins for which orthology to gnathostome lamins cannot be designated. Search for lamin gene sequences in all vertebrate taxa for which sufficient sequence data are available reveals the evolutionary time frame in which specific features of the vertebrate lamins were established. Structural features characteristic for A-type lamins are not found in the lamprey genome. In contrast, lmna genes are present in all gnathostome lineages suggesting that this gene evolved with the emergence of the gnathostomes. The analysis of lamin gene neighborhoods reveals noticeable similarities between the different vertebrate lamin genes supporting the hypothesis that they emerged due to two rounds of whole genome duplication and makes clear that an orthologous relationship between a particular vertebrate paralog and lamins outside the vertebrate lineage cannot be established.

Abstract: Eliglustat is an investigational, oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). Nineteen treatment-naïve patients have now completed 4years of an open-label study (NCT00358150). Mean hemoglobin level and platelet count increased by 2.3±1.5g/dL (baseline: 11.3±1.5g/dL) and 95% (baseline: 68,700±21,200/mm3), respectively. Mean spleen and liver volumes (multiples of normal, MN) decreased by 63% (baseline: 17.3±9.5 MN) and 28% (baseline: 1.7±0.4 MN), respectively. Median chitotriosidase and CCL-18 each decreased by 82%; plasma glucosylceramide and GM3 normalized. Mean bone mineral density T-score for the lumbar spine increased by 0.8 (60%) (baseline: −1.6±1.1). Femur dark marrow, a reflection of Gaucher cell infiltration into bone marrow, was reduced or stable in 17/18 patients. There were no bone crises. Most adverse events were mild and unrelated to treatment. These results extend the safety and efficacy of eliglustat reported at 1 and 2years to 4years.

Abstract: Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a hereditary amyloidosis induced by amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR). Because most transthyretin (TTR) in serum is synthesized by the liver, liver transplantation (LT) is today the only treatment available to halt the progression of FAP, even though LT is associated with several problems. Despite the urgent need to develop alternatives to LT, the detailed pathogenesis of FAP is still unknown; also, no model fully represents the relevant processes in patients with FAP. The induction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has allowed development of pluripotent cells specific for patients and has led to useful models of human diseases. Because of the need for a tool to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of FAP, in this study we sought to establish heterozygous ATTR mutant iPS cells, and were successful, by using a Sendai virus vector mixture containing four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) to reprogram dermal fibroblasts derived from FAP patients. Moreover, FAP-specific iPS cells had the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells and indeed expressed ATTR. FAP-specific iPS cells demonstrated the possibility of serving as a pathological tool that will contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of FAP and development of FAP treatments.

Phosphoregulation of the human SMN complex,

Abstract: The survival motor neuron (SMN) complex is a macromolecular machine comprising 9 core proteins: SMN, Gemins2–8 and unrip in vertebrates. It performs tasks in RNA metabolism including the cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). The SMN complex also localizes to the nucleus, where it accumulates in Cajal Bodies (CB) and may function in transcription and/or pre-mRNA splicing. The SMN complex is subject to extensive phosphorylation. Detailed understanding of SMN complex regulation necessitates a comprehensive analysis of these post-translational modifications. Here, we report on the first comprehensive phosphoproteome analysis of the intact human SMN complex, which identify 48 serine/threonine phosphosites in the complex. We find that 7 out of 9 SMN components of the intact complex are phosphoproteins and confidently place 29 phosphorylation sites, 12 of them in SMN itself. By the generation of multi non-phosphorylatable or phosphomimetic variants of SMN, respectively, we address to which extent phosphorylation regulates SMN complex function and localization. Both phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable variants assemble into intact SMN complexes and can compensate the loss of endogenous SMN in snRNP assembly at least to some extent. However, they partially or completely fail to target to nuclear Cajal bodies. Moreover, using a mutant of SMN, which cannot be phosphorylated on previously reported tyrosine residues, we provide first evidence that this PTM regulates SMN localization and nuclear accumulation. Our data suggest complex regulatory cues mediated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, which control the subcellular localization of the SMN complex and its accumulation in nuclear CB.

Abstract: The mechanical environment of a cell has a profound effect on its behaviour, from dictating cell shape to driving the transcription of specific genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that mechanical forces play a key role in orienting the mitotic spindle, and therefore cell division, in both single cells and tissues. Whilst the molecular machinery that mediates the link between external force and the mitotic spindle remains largely unknown, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is a widely used mechanism which could prove vital for coordinating cell division orientation across tissues in a variety of contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have suggested that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) mediate metastasis, are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, and contribute to relapse. Although several BCSC markers have been described, it is unclear whether these markers identify the same or independent BCSCs. Here, we show that BCSCs exist in distinct mesenchymal-like (epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT]) and epithelial-like (mesenchymal-epithelial transition [MET]) states. Mesenchymal-like BCSCs characterized as CD24−CD44+ are primarily quiescent and localized at the tumor invasive front, whereas epithelial-like BCSCs express aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), are proliferative, and are located more centrally. The gene-expression profiles of mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like BCSCs are remarkably similar across different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and resemble those of distinct basal and luminal stem cells found in the normal breast. We propose that the plasticity of BCSCs that allows them to transition between EMT- and MET-like states endows these cells with the capacity for tissue invasion, dissemination, and growth at metastatic sites.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the mechanisms of mitotic spindle orientation during mammary gland morphogenesis. Here, we report the presence of huntingtin, the protein mutated in Huntington’s disease, in mouse mammary basal and luminal cells throughout mammogenesis. Keratin 5-driven depletion of huntingtin results in a decreased pool and specification of basal and luminal progenitors, and altered mammary morphogenesis. Analysis of mitosis in huntingtin-depleted basal progenitors reveals mitotic spindle misorientation. In mammary cell culture, huntingtin regulates spindle orientation in a dynein-dependent manner. Huntingtin is targeted to spindle poles through its interaction with dynein and promotes the accumulation of NUMA and LGN. Huntingtin is also essential for the cortical localization of dynein, dynactin, NUMA, and LGN by regulating their kinesin 1-dependent trafficking along astral microtubules. We thus suggest that huntingtin is a component of the pathway regulating the orientation of mammary stem cell division, with potential implications for their self-renewal and differentiation properties.

Abstract: Transcription factor RUNX3 is associated with gastric tumorigenesis and progression through regulating the expression of its target genes. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family and has been shown to inhibit cell apoptosis and promote cell proliferation. Increased survivin expression has been found in various cancer types, including gastric cancer. In this study, we found that restoration of RUNX3 promotes cell apoptosis through inhibiting the survivin expression, while RUNX3 inhibition increases the expression of survivin in gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, RUNX3 over-expression inhibits,whereas its inhibition increases, the promoter activity of survivin gene, respectively. RUNX3-R122C, a mutation located in the conserved Runt domain, has no effect on the promoter activity of survivin gene. We further identified a RUNX3-binding site in the promoter of survivin gene and the binding of RUNX3 on survivin promoter leads to significantly inhibition of survivin expression. Finally, we confirmed the negative correlation of RUNX3 and survivin expression in clinical specimens of gastric cancer. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of RUNX3 for the induction of cell apoptosis in human gastric cancer.

Abstract: Aldose reductase family member B10 (AKR1B10) belongs to the aldo–keto reductase gene superfamily and is closely related to aldose reductase (AKR1B1). It has been shown that AKR1B10 is present in many of the same human tissues as AKR1B1. The objective of this study was to investigate whether AKR1B10 has a role in diabetic nephropathy (DN) by investigating its response to high glucose and inflammation, both of which have been associated with the development and progression of DN. Expression levels of AKR1B10 were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 25 patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy, 25 without DN and 25 normal healthy controls that were exposed to high glucose (25mM d-glucose) and also the inflammatory stressor lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 μm). Under high glucose and LPS conditions, there was a significant increase in the expression of AKR1B10 in the PBMCs from patients with DN compared to those without DN and the normal controls. In conclusion, these results suggest that AKR1B10 may have an important role in the development and progression of DN.

Abstract: Increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is beneficial for β-hemoglobinopathy patients; however, current inducing agents do not possess the ideal combination of efficacy, safety and ease of use. Better understanding the mechanisms involved in γ-globin gene induction is critical for designing improved therapies, as no complete mechanism for any inducing agent has been identified. Given the cytotoxic nature of most known inducing drugs, we hypothesized that γ-globin is a cell stress response gene, and that induction occurs via activation of cell stress signaling pathways. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the ability of physical stresses including heat-shock (HS), UV- and X-irradiation and osmotic shock to increase γ-globin gene expression in erythroid cells. Experiments in K562 and KU812 cells showed that each of these stresses increased steady-state γ-globin mRNA levels, but only after 3–5days of treatments. HS and UV also increased γ-globin mRNA and HbF levels in differentiating primary human erythroid cells. Mechanistic studies showed that HS affects γ-globin mRNA at multiple levels, including nascent transcription and transcript stability, and that induction is dependent on neither the master regulator of the canonical HS response, HSF1, nor p38 MAPK. Inhibitor panel testing identified PI3K inhibitor LY294002 as a novel inducing agent and revealed potential roles for NFκB and VEGFR/PDGFR/Raf kinases in HS-mediated γ-globin gene induction. These findings suggest that cell stress signaling pathways play an important role in γ-globin gene induction and may provide novel targets for the pharmacologic induction of fetal hemoglobin.

Abstract: Anemia of inflammation or chronic disease is a highly prevalent form of anemia. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) negatively correlates with hemoglobin concentration in many disease states. The IL-6-hepcidin antimicrobial peptide axis promotes iron-restricted anemia; however the full role of IL-6 in anemia of inflammation is not well-defined. We previously reported that chronic inflammation had a negative impact on maturation of erythroid progenitors in a mouse model. We hypothesized that IL-6 may be responsible for impaired erythropoiesis, independent of iron restriction. To test the hypothesis we utilized the human erythroleukemia TF-1 cell line to model erythroid maturation and exposed them to varying doses of IL-6 over six days. At 10ng/ml, IL-6 significantly repressed erythropoietin-dependent TF-1 erythroid maturation. While IL-6 did not decrease the expression of genes associated with hemoglobin synthesis, we observed impaired hemoglobin synthesis as demonstrated by decreased benzidine staining. We also observed that IL-6 down regulated expression of the gene SLC4a1 which is expressed late in erythropoiesis. Those findings suggested that IL-6-dependent inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis might occur. We investigated the impact of IL-6 on mitochondria. IL-6 decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential at all treatment doses, and significantly decreased mitochondrial mass at the highest dose. Our studies indicate that IL-6 may impair mitochondrial function in maturing erythroid cells resulting in impaired hemoglobin production and erythroid maturation. Our findings may indicate a novel pathway of action for IL-6 in the anemia of inflammation, and draw attention to the potential for new therapeutic targets that affect late erythroid development.

Abstract: Molecular genetic studies are typically performed on homogenized biological samples, resulting in contamination from non-neuronal cells. To improve expression profiling of neurons we combined patch recordings with single-cell PCR. Two iPSC lines (healthy subject and 22q11.2 deletion) were differentiated into neurons. Patch electrode recordings were performed on 229 human cells from Day-13 to Day-88, followed by capture and single-cell PCR for 13 genes: ACTB, HPRT, vGLUT1, βTUBIII, COMT, DISC1, GAD1, PAX6, DTNBP1, ERBB4, FOXP1, FOXP2, and GIRK2. Neurons derived from both iPSC lines expressed βTUBIII, fired action potentials, and experienced spontaneous depolarizations (UP states) ~2weeks before vGLUT1, GAD1 and GIRK2 appeared. Multisite calcium imaging revealed that these UP states were not synchronized among hESC-H9-derived neurons. The expression of FOXP1, FOXP2 and vGLUT1 was lost after 50days in culture, in contrast to other continuously expressed genes. When gene expression was combined with electrophysiology, two subsets of genes were apparent; those irrelevant to spontaneous depolarizations (including vGLUT1, GIRK2, FOXP2 and DISC1) and those associated with spontaneous depolarizations (GAD1 and ERBB4). The results demonstrate that in the earliest stages of neuron development, it is useful to combine genetic analysis with physiological characterizations, on a cell-to-cell basis.

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) adhesion and migration are fundamental to a number of pathophysiologic processes, including fracture and wound healing. Vitamin C is beneficial for bone formation, fracture repair and wound healing. However, the role of the vitamin C transporter in BMSC adhesion, migration and wound healing is not known. In this study, we knocked-down the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter, SVCT2, the only known transporter of vitamin C in BMSCs, and performed cell adhesion, migration, in-vitro scratch wound healing and F-actin re-arrangement studies. We also investigated the role of oxidative stress on the above processes. Our results demonstrate that both oxidative stress and down-regulation of SVCT2 decreased cell attachment and spreading. A trans-well cell migration assay showed that vitamin C helped in BMSC migration and that knockdown of SVCT2 decreased cell migration. In the in-vitro scratch wound healing studies, we established that oxidative stress dose-dependently impairs wound healing. Furthermore, the supplementation of vitamin C significantly rescued the BMSCs from oxidative stress and increased wound closing. The knockdown of SVCT2 in BMSCs strikingly decreased wound healing, and supplementing with vitamin C failed to rescue cells efficiently. The knockdown of SVCT2 and induction of oxidative stress in cells produced an alteration in cytoskeletal dynamics. Signaling studies showed that oxidative stress phosphorylated members of the MAP kinase family (p38) and that vitamin C inhibited their phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that both the SVCT2 transporter and oxidative stress play a vital role in BMSC attachment, migration and cytoskeletal re-arrangement. BMSC-based cell therapy and modulation of SVCT2 could lead to a novel therapeutic approach that enhances bone remodeling, fracture repair and wound healing in chronic disease conditions.

Abstract: The physical properties of cells reflect how the structure and dynamics of the actomyosin cortex are coupled to the plasma membrane. In epithelia, adhesive E-cadherin clusters associate with the cell cortex to assemble the junctional actomyosin that participates in epithelial morphogenesis. E-cadherin is present not only at the apical zonula adherens (ZA), but also distributed throughout the lateral adherens junction (LAJ) below the ZA. However, the organizational dynamics of the actomyosin network at the LAJs remains elusive. To address this, we used quantitative real-time imaging to characterize the dynamics of actomyosin contractility at lateral cadherin contacts. Here, we report that contractility is coordinated into smaller actomyosin rings that link cadherin clusters together within the larger cortical network at the lateral junctions. We conclude that Myosin II activity determines the contractility of actomyosin cables between cadherin clusters to propagate pulsatility across lateral cell–cell contacts.

Abstract: Spir proteins nucleate actin filaments at vesicle membranes and facilitate intracellular transport processes. The mammalian genome encodes two Spir proteins, namely Spir-1 and Spir-2. While the mouse spir-2 gene has a rather broad expression pattern, high levels of spir-1 expression are restricted to the nervous system, oocytes, and testis. Spir-1 mutant mice generated by a gene trap method have been employed to address Spir-1 function during mouse development and in adult mouse tissues, with a specific emphasis on viability, reproduction, and the nervous system. The gene trap cassette disrupts Spir-1 expression between the N-terminal KIND domain and the WH2 domain cluster. Spir-1 mutant mice are viable and were born in a Mendelian ratio. In accordance with the redundant function of Spir-1 and Spir-2 in oocyte maturation, spir-1 mutant mice are fertile. The overall brain anatomy of spir-1 mutant mice is not altered and visual and motor functions of the mice remain normal. Microscopic analysis shows a slight reduction in the number of dendritic spines on cortical neurons. Detailed behavioral studies of the spir-1 mutant mice, however, unveiled a very specific and highly significant phenotype in terms of fear learning in male mice. In contextual and cued fear conditioning experiments the male spir-1 mutant mice display increased fear memory when compared to their control littermates. Our data point toward a particular function of the vesicle associated Spir-1 actin organizer in neuronal circuits determining fear behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular innate immune receptor NOD1 detects Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) to induce autophagy and inflammatory responses in host cells. To date, the intracellular compartment in which PG is detected by NOD1 and whether NOD1 directly interacts with PG are two questions that remain to be resolved. To address this, we used outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from pathogenic bacteria as a physiological mechanism to deliver PG into the host cell cytosol. We report that OMVs induced autophagosome formation and inflammatory IL-8 responses in epithelial cells in a NOD1- and RIP2-dependent manner. PG contained within OMVs colocalized with both NOD1 and RIP2 in EEA1-positive early endosomes. Further, we provide evidence for direct interactions between NOD1 and PG. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NOD1 detects PG within early endosomes, thereby promoting RIP2-dependent autophagy and inflammatory signaling in response to bacterial infection.

Abstract: Study background: Extended liver resection is the only curative treatment option of liver cancer. Yet, the residual liver may not accomplish the high metabolic and regenerative capacity needed, which frequently leads to acute liver failure. Because of their anti-inflammatory and -apoptotic as well as pro-proliferative features, mesenchymal stem cells differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells might provide functional and regenerative compensation. Clinical translation of basic research requires pre-clinical approval in large animals. Therefore, we characterized porcine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from adipose tissue and bone marrow and their hepatocyte differentiation potential for future assessment of functional liver support after surgical intervention in the pig model.
Methods
Mesenchymal surface antigens and multi-lineage differentiation potential of porcine MSC isolated by collagenase digestion either from bone marrow or adipose tissue (subcutaneous/visceral) were assessed by flow cytometry. Morphology and functional properties (urea-, glycogen synthesis and cytochrome P450 activity) were determined during culture under differentiation conditions and compared with primary porcine hepatocytes.
Results
MSC from porcine adipose tissue and from bone marrow express the typical mesenchymal markers CD44, CD29, CD90 and CD105 but not haematopoietic markers. MSC from both sources displayed differentiation into the osteogenic as well as adipogenic lineage. After hepatocyte differentiation, expression of CD105 decreased significantly and cells adopted the typical polygonal morphology of hepatocytes. Glycogen storage was comparable in adipose tissue- and bone marrow-derived cells. Urea synthesis was about 35% lower in visceral than in subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived MSC. Cytochrome P450 activity increased significantly during differentiation and was twice as high in hepatocyte-like cells generated from bone marrow as from adipose tissue.
Conclusion
The hepatocyte differentiation of porcine adipose tissue-derived MSC was shown for the first time yielding hepatocyte-like cells with specific functions similar in bone marrow and subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived MSC. That makes them good pre-clinical candidates for supportive approaches after liver resection in the pig.

Abstract: Background
Red cell (RBC) blood group alloimmunization remains a major problem in transfusion medicine. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at particularly high risk for developing alloantibodies to RBC antigens compared to other multiply transfused patient populations. Hemagglutination is the classical method used to test for blood group antigens, but depending on the typing methods and reagents used may result in discrepancies that preclude interpretation based on serologic reactivity alone. Molecular methods, including customized DNA microarrays, are increasingly used to complement serologic methods in predicting blood type. The purpose of this study was to determine the diversity and frequency of RH alleles in African Americans and to assess the performance of a DNA microarray for RH allele determination.
Material and methods
Two sets of samples were tested: (i) individuals with known variant Rh types and (ii) randomly selected African American donors and patients with SCD. Standard hemagglutination tests were used to establish the Rh phenotype, and cDNA- and gDNA-based analyses (sequencing, PCR-RFLP, and customized RHD and RHCE microarrays were used to predict the genotype).
Results
In a total of 829 samples (1658 alleles), 72 different alleles (40 RHD and 32 RHCE) were identified, 22 of which are novel. DNA microarrays detected all nucleotides probed, allowing for characterization of over 900 alleles.
Conclusions
High-throughput DNA testing platforms provide a means to test a relatively large number of donors and potentially prevent immunization by changing the way antigen-negative blood is provided to patients. Because of the high RH allelic diversity found in the African American population, determination of an accurate Rh phenotype often requires DNA testing, in conjunction with serologic testing. Allele-specific microarrays offer a means to perform high-throughput donor Rh typing and serve as a valuable adjunct to serologic methods to predict Rh type. Because DNA microarrays test for only a fixed panel of allelic polymorphisms and cannot determine haplotype phase, alternative methods such as Next Generation Sequencing hold the greatest potential to accurately characterize blood group phenotypes and ameliorate the clinical course of multiply-transfused patients with sickle cell disease.

Fatty acid synthase plays a role in cancer metabolism beyond providing fatty acids for phospholipid synthesis or sustaining elevations in glycolytic activity,

Abstract: Fatty acid synthase is over-expressed in many cancers and its activity is required for cancer cell survival, but the role of endogenously synthesized fatty acids in cancer is unknown. It has been suggested that endogenous fatty acid synthesis is either needed to support the growth of rapidly dividing cells, or to maintain elevated glycolysis (the Warburg effect) that is characteristic of cancer cells. Here, we investigate both hypotheses. First, we compared utilization of fatty acids synthesized endogenously from 14C-labeled acetate to those supplied exogenously as 14C-labeled palmitate in the culture medium in human breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). We found that cancer cells do not produce fatty acids that are different from those derived from exogenous palmitate, that these fatty acids are esterified to the same lipid and phospholipid classes in the same proportions, and that their distribution within neutral lipids is not different from untransformed cells. These results suggest that endogenously synthesized fatty acids do not fulfill a specific function in cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells excrete endogenously synthesized fatty acids, suggesting that they are produced in excess of requirements. We next investigated whether lipogenic activity is involved in the maintenance of high glycolytic activity by culturing both cancer and non-transformed cells under anoxic conditions. Although anoxia increased glycolysis 2–3 fold, we observed no concomitant increase in lipogenesis. Our results indicate that breast cancer cells do not have a specific qualitative or quantitative requirement for endogenously synthesized fatty acids and that increased de novo lipogenesis is not required to sustain elevations in glycolytic activity induced by anoxia in these cells.

Abstract: Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier is an important pathogenic factor of inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory conditions of the gut. Somatostatin (SST) has been demonstrated to reduce local and systemic inflammation reactions and maintain the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). To determine the beneficial effect of SST on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage of the tight junction (TJ) and its mechanisms, Caco2 cells pretreated with SST (1nM) or MEK inhibitor U0126 (10μM) were exposed to LPS. LPS significantly reduced the expression of TJ proteins in a dose-dependent way. LPS (100μg/ml) greatly induced Caco2 monolayer barrier dysfunction by decreasing transepithelial resistance and increasing epithelial permeability. Pretreatment with SST effectively improved the barrier dysfunction of Caco2 cells. SST significantly increased the expression of TJ proteins occludin and ZO-1 and inhibited the redistribution of TJ proteins due to LPS stimulation. Furthermore, SST decreased the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and a selective MEK inhibitor markedly protected the barrier function against LPS disturbance by blocking the activation of the ERK–MAPK pathway in Caco2 cells. Besides, LPS significantly increased the mRNA level of SSTR5, which was partly inhibited by pretreatment with SST. In conclusion, the present study indicates that SST protects the Caco2 monolayer barrier against LPS-induced tight junction breakdown by down-regulating the activation of the ERK–MAPK pathway and suppression the activation of SSTR5.

Abstract: We aimed to investigate the influence of haptoglobin (Hp) and myeloperoxidase (MPO −G463A; dbSNP rs2333227) gene polymorphisms on 78 sickle cell patients of a public hospital in the Federal District/Brazil with and without iron overload, to evaluate a possible association between these polymorphisms and clinical variability, response to treatment and prognosis. Data were obtained through laboratory tests, questionnaires, research in medical records and analyses of polymorphisms using PCR-based methods. Positive correlations were found between Hp and ferritin levels, hydroxyurea treatment, hospitalisation for and sequelae from stroke; and between MPO and number of hospitalizations in the past 12months and splenectomy. Significant associations of specific Hp genotypes with comorbidities were also found, while results suggested that MPO AA homozygosis could increase effects of asplenia. Deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, compatible with heterozygous deficit, was observed for Hp polymorphism. Odds ratio suggested the possibility that increased chance of hospitalisation for stroke (OR=6.346; IC 95%=1.56–25.79; p=0.005) and sequelae of stroke (OR=6.556; IC 95%=1.578–27.237; p=0.005) could be associated with lower frequency of 1S-2 than expected. In the interaction analyses, significant effects between subjects were shown only in the group without overload for Hp polymorphism in hs-CRP levels (p=0.000) and number of transfusions (p=0.018), and for MPO polymorphism (p=0.000) and the interaction Hp/MPO (p=0.000) in hs-CRP values. Results corroborate others indicating biological differences between Hp⁎1 alleles and highlight the importance of this study in understanding the biological significance of Hp and MPO polymorphisms in clinical variability and response to treatment of sickle cell patients.

Abstract: Activated platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial extracellular matrix and undergo a rapid cytoskeletal rearrangement resulting in shape change and release of their intracellular dense and alpha granule contents to avoid hemorrhage. A central step in this process is the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration through its release from intracellular stores and on throughout its influx from the extracellular space. The Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a highly selective Na+ channel involved in mechanosensation, nociception, fluid volume homeostasis, and control of arterial blood pressure. The present study describes the expression, distribution, and participation of ENaC in platelet migration and granule secretion using pharmacological inhibition with amiloride. Our biochemical and confocal analysis in suspended and adhered platelets suggests that ENaC is associated with Intermediate filaments (IF) and with Dystrophin-associated proteins (DAP) via α-syntrophin and β-dystroglycan. Migration assays, quantification of soluble P-selectin, and serotonin release suggest that ENaC is dispensable for migration and alpha and dense granule secretion, whereas Na+ influx through this channel is fundamental for platelet collagen activation.

Abstract: A double minute chromosome (dmin) is a small fragment of extrachromosomal DNA bearing amplified genes observed in malignancies. We investigated the incidence and characteristics of dmins in hematologic malignancies, and the quantitative changes during the treatment follow-up. Once a dmin was observed in conventional G-banding, it was characterized using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the panel of MYC, NMYC, and MLL probes. Quantitative changes of malignant cells were measured using G-banding and FISH during the follow up. Dmins were observed in 1.23% of patients (6/489) at the initial diagnosis including 4 with MYC amplification, 1 with MLL and 1 with NMYC. All 6 had complex karyotypes and showed short overall survival (7.7months). In follow-up specimens, FISH detected dmins in 11 cases out of which G-banding detected dmins in 9 cases. The number of dmins detected by FISH and G-banding did not correlate well. Amplification of NMYC in dmins is reported for the first time. A FISH panel composed of frequently amplified oncogenes (MYC, NMYC, and MLL) in dmins is useful for characterization of dmins. FISH is a sensitive method in detecting dmins and will be useful in monitoring of the minimal residual disease.

Abstract: Background
X-linked hyper-IgM (XHIM) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infections, low serum IgG and IgA and normal or elevated IgM. It results from mutations in the CD40 ligand (CD40L) gene. Confirmation of diagnosis with identification of underlying molecular defect is important for the initiation of appropriate therapeutic interventions, including immunoglobulin replacement, antibiotics and bone marrow transplantation.
Methods
To investigate the molecular basis of XHIM, we evaluated 7 patients with suspected XHIM and abnormal CD40L expression on activated CD4+ T lymphocytes. The entire coding region and intronic splice sites of the CD40L gene were sequenced from the genomic DNA of the patients.
Results
7 mutations; 3 nonsense (c.172delA, c.A229T, c.C478T), 1 missense (c.A506G) and 3 splice sites [c.346+2(T→C), c.289-1(G→C), c.346+1(G→T)] were identified, out of which 5 were novel.
Conclusion
A wide heterogeneity in the nature of mutations has been observed in Indian XHIM patients in the present study. Identification of mutations in this rare disorder will help in genetic diagnosis in affected families which could be further useful in prenatal diagnosis.

Abstract: Anemia is common in older persons and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. One third of anemic older adults have unexplained anemia of the elderly (UAE). We carried out a randomized, wait list control trial in outpatients with UAE and serum ferritin levels between 20 and 200ng/mL. Intravenous iron sucrose was given as a 200-mg weekly dose for 5weeks either immediately after enrollment (immediate intervention group) or following a 12-week wait list period (wait list control group). The primary outcome measure was changed in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distances from baseline to 12weeks between the two groups. Hematologic, physical, cognitive, and quality of life parameters were also assessed. The study was terminated early after 19 subjects enrolled. The distance walked in the 6MWT increased a mean 8.05±55.48m in the immediate intervention group and decreased a mean 11.45±49.46m in the wait list control group (p=0.443). The hemoglobin increased a mean 0.39±0.46g/dL in the immediate intervention group and declined a mean 0.39±0.85g/dL in the wait list control group (p=0.026). Thus, a subgroup of adults with UAE may respond to intravenous iron. Enrollment of subjects into this type of study remains challenging.

Abstract: Severe aplastic anemia (SAA), which is considered to be an immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow stem cells with pancytopenia and hypoplasia, can be successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Between January 2009 and December 2012, thirteen patients diagnosed with SAA were treated with tacrolimus plus rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The outcomes were then compared with our previous data for twenty-four patients administered with cyclosporine (CsA) plus rabbit ATG-based IST. All 37 cases accepted methylpredenisolone and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) from the first day that rabbit ATG was initiated. A total of 7 (54%) of the 13 patients in the tacrolimus group and 10 (42%) of the 24 cases in the ATG+CsA group achieved the criteria for complete response (CR); the partial response (PR) rate was 31% in the tacrolimus group and 33% in the ATG+CsA group. The median follow-up duration of the tacrolimus group and ATG+CsA group patients was 28months and 27months, respectively. Two patients in the tacrolimus group who were red blood cell- and platelet transfusion-dependent died, one of sepsis and the other of cerebral hemorrhage, whereas one patient died from serious infection on the 5th day after ATG was initiated in the ATG+CsA group. No clonal transformation to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) was observed in either group. Our data provide a possibility of using tacrolimus as part of an IST regimen for SAA in adults who have no opportunity of HSCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donors.

Abstract: Vascular calcification is common in patients with peripheral artery diseases and coronary artery diseases. The osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes significantly to vascular calcification. Adiponectin has been demonstrated to exert a protective effect in osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs through regulating mTOR activity. However, the upstream and downstream signaling molecules of adiponectin-regulated mTOR signaling have not been identified in VSMCs with osteoblastic differentiation. In this study, the VSMC differentiation model was established by beta-glycerophosphate (β-GP) induction. The mineralization was identified by Alizarin Red S staining. Protein expression and phosphorylation were detected by Western blot or immunofluorescence. Adiponectin attenuated osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of β-GP-treated VSMCs. Adiponectin inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs through increasing the level of p-AMPKα. Pretreatment of VSMCs with AMPK inhibitor blocked while AMPK activator enhanced the effect of adiponectin on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs. Adiponectin upregulated TSC2 expression and downregulated mTOR and S6K1 phosphorylation in β-GP-treated VSMCs.

Abstract: The present study identified ATF3 as a novel dynamic marker for ependymal stem/progenitor cells (nestin, vimentin and SOX2 positive) around the central canal of the neonatal or adult rat spinal cord. While quiescent ependymal cells showed cytoplasmic ATF3 expression, during 6–24h in vitro these cells mobilized and acquired intense nuclear ATF3 staining. Their migratory pattern followed a centrifugal pathway toward the dorsal and ventral funiculi, reminiscent of the rostral migratory stream of the brain subventricular stem cells. Thus, the chain cell formation was, by analogy, termed funicular migratory stream (FMS). The FMS process preceded the strong proliferation of ependymal cells occurring only after 24h in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of MAPK-p38 and JNK/c-Jun (upstream effectors of ATF3 activation) prevented the FMS mobilization of ATF3 nuclear-positive cells. Excitotoxicity or ischemia-like conditions, reported to evoke neuronal and glial injury, did not further enhance migration of ependymal cells at 24h, suggesting that, at this early stage of damage, the FMS phenomenon had peaked and that more extensive repair processes are delayed beyond this time point. ATF3 is, therefore, useful to identify activation and migration of endogenous stem cells of the rat spinal cord in vitro.

Mediation of dopamine D2 receptors activation in post-conditioning-attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis,

Abstract: The physiological and pathological roles of dopamine D2 receptors (DR2) in the regulation of cardiovacular functions have been recognized. DR2 activation protects hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis, and ischemic post-conditioning (PC) plays a critical role in cardioprotection as well; however the involvement of the DR2 activation in the PC-induced cardioprotection is unknown. In the present study, we found that the H/R increased the expressions of DR2 mRNA and protein in cardiomyocytes, which were significantly enhanced by PC. Bromocriptine (Bro, a DR2 agonist) further increased DR2 expression, but Haloperidol (Hal, a DR2 antagonist) reversed the Bro-induced DR2 expressions. PC protected against H/R-induced apoptosis, the rise of [Ca2+]i, the expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and -9, release of cytochrome c, and mPTP opening. In addition, PC counteracted the reduction of cell viability caused by H/R, increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PI3K, Akt, GSK-3β and mitochondrial membrane potential. PC further increased Bcl-2 expression, promoted PKC-ε translocation to cell membrane, and activated the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K channels (mKATP). Bro further enhanced the cardioprotective roles of PC, but Hal reversed these effects of Bro. Meanwhile, we found that DR2 was expressed in cell membrane and interacted with PKC-ε in PC. In conclusion, these results suggest that PC attenuates cardiomyocyte apoptosis via inhibition of mPTP opening by DR2-mediated activation of ERK1/2, PI3K–Akt–GSK-3β and PKC-ε–mKATP. These findings provide a novel target for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species function in host defense via mechanisms that remain controversial. Pathogens might encounter varying levels of these species, but bulk measurements cannot resolve such heterogeneity. We used single-cell approaches to determine the impact of oxidative and nitrosative stresses on individual Salmonella during early infection in mouse spleen. Salmonella encounter and respond to both stresses, but the levels and impact vary widely. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes kill Salmonella by generating overwhelming oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. This controls Salmonella within inflammatory lesions but does not prevent their spread to more permissive resident red pulp macrophages, which generate only sublethal oxidative bursts. Regional host expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase exposes some Salmonella to nitrosative stress, triggering effective local Salmonella detoxification through nitric oxide denitrosylase. Thus, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species influence dramatically different outcomes of disparate Salmonella-host cell encounters, which together determine overall disease progression.

Abstract: Invasion is the key requirement for cancer metastasis. Expression of β1,6 branched N-oligosaccharides associated with invasiveness, has been shown to promote adhesion to most Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) and basement membrane (BM) components and haptotactic motility on ECM (fibronectin) but attenuate it on BM (laminin/matrigel) components. To explore the mechanism and to evaluate the significance of these observations in terms of invasion, highly invasive B16BL6 cells were compared with the parent (B16F10) cells or B16BL6 cells in which glycosylation was inhibited. We demonstrate that increased adhesion to matrix components induced secretion of MMP-9, important for invasion. Further, both the subunits of integrin receptors for fibronectin (α5β1) and laminin (α3β1) on B16BL6 cells were shown to carry these oligosaccharides. Although, glycosylation of receptors had no effect on their surface expression, it had same differential effect on cell spreading as haptotactic motility. Absence of correlation between invasiveness and expression of most tetraspanins (major regulators of integrin function) hints at an alternate mechanism. Here we show that glycosylation on α3β1 impedes its association with CD151 and modulates spreading and motility of cells apparently to reach an optimum required for invasion of BM. These studies demonstrate the complex mechanisms used by cancer cells to be invasive.

Abstract: Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia major (TM), are severe diseases and the most common autosomal recessive condition worldwide and in particular in Oman. Early screening and diagnosis of carriers are the key for primary prevention. Once a country-wide population screening program is mandated by law, a sequencing technology that can rapidly confirm or identify disease-causing mutations for a large number of patients in a short period of time will be necessary. While Sanger sequencing is the standard protocol for molecular diagnosis, next generation sequencing starts to become available to reference laboratories. Using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer, we have analyzed a cohort of 297 unrelated Omani cases and reliably identified mutations in the beta-globin (HBB) gene. Our model study has shown that Ion Torrent PGM can rapidly sequence such a small gene in a large number of samples using a barcoded uni-directional or bi-directional sequence methodology, reducing cost, workload and providing accurate diagnosis. Based on our results we believe that the Ion Torrent PGM sequencing platform, able to analyze hundreds of patients simultaneously for a single disease gene can be a valid molecular screening alternative to ABI sequencing in the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies and other genetic disorders in the near future.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of two unrelated Chinese patients with hemostatic disorders. The proband of the first family had severe hemophilia A (HA) coexisting with type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) and the proband of the second family had type 2N VWD. Both probands had similar phenotypes, which included joint and mucosal bleeding, very low factor VIII (FVIII) activity (FVIII:C), and moderate reductions in VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:Rco), as well as a normal multimeric pattern. One FVIII mutation and three VWF mutations were identified: FVIII p.R446* and VWF heterozygous p.E216K mutations were detected in proband 1 and compound heterozygosity of VWF mutations (p.R816W and c.1911delC) in proband 2. Transient expression studies in HEK293T cells proved that R816W mutation abolished the binding of FVIII to VWF and slightly impaired protein synthesis and secretion; 1911delC mutation mainly impaired VWF protein synthesis and secretion. These results provided insight into the possible pathogenic mechanism of type 2N VWD in Chinese patients carrying these mutations.

Abstract: The BIRC5 gene encodes the oncofetal protein SURVIVIN, as well as four additional splice variants (ΔEx3, 2B, 3B and 2α). SURVIVIN, an inhibitor of apoptosis, is also a chromosomal passenger protein (CPP). Previous results have demonstrated that SURVIVIN is expressed at high levels in embryonic stem cells and inhibition of SURVIVIN function results in apoptosis, however these studies have not investigated the other four splice variants. In this study, we demonstrate that all variants are expressed at significantly higher levels in human embryonic stem (hES) cells than in differentiated cells. We examined the subcellular localization of the three most highly expressed variants. SURVIVIN displayed canonical CPP localization in mitotic cells and cytoplasmic localization in interphase cells. In contrast, SURVIVIN–ΔEx3 and SURVIVIN–2B did not localize as a CPP; SURVIVIN–ΔEx3 was found constitutively in the nucleus while SURVIVIN–2B was distributed along the chromosomes during mitosis and also to the mitotic spindle poles. We used inducible shRNA against SURVIVIN to inhibit expression in a titratable fashion. Using this system, we reduced the mRNA levels of these three variants to approx. 40%, resulting in a concomitant reduction of OCT4 and NANOG mRNA, suggesting a role for the SURVIVIN variants in pluripotency.

Abstract: Osteopathy represents a prominent cause of morbidity in patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) and manifests as osteopenia/osteoporosis. Biochemical turnover markers (BTMs) are considered a useful, non-invasive tool for the clinical follow-up of osteoporotic patients; they can provide a dynamic view of the remodeling process and give information on the metabolic activity of bone tissue as well as on the pathogenesis of bone loss. The amino-terminal pro-peptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) is a recently introduced marker that is considered the most sensitive index of bone formation. Although demonstrated in several categories of patients with bone disease, there is little information on the clinical usefulness of this bone formation index in thalassemic patients. We evaluated the P1NP levels of 53 adult patients with b-thalassemia major (21 males and 32 females, mean age 34.5±5.7, range 22–46years) and associated osteopathy. We investigated the correlation between P1NP and bone condition as examined by dual X-ray photon absorptiometry and with BTMs expressing bone resorption and bone mineralization (carboxyterminal collagen cross-linked (CTX) terminal regions of type I collagen and osteocalcin, respectively). P1NP serum levels were correlated with CTX levels (r=0.545, p<0.001); the results were unchanged when males and females, as well as osteoporotic and osteopenic subgroups, were considered separately. No correlation was demonstrated neither between OC and CTX (r=0.17, p=ns), nor between P1NP and OC levels (r=0.11, p=ns). No correlation was demonstrated among the P1NP/CTX ratio and age, OC or densitometric values and no difference was found in the same ratio between osteopenic (0.19±0.16) and osteoporotic (0.15±0.14) patients. Similar results were obtained for the OC/CTX ratio, as it was not correlated with age, P1NP or densitometric values. This is the first report of circulating P1NP in patients with TM-associated osteoporosis. P1NP and CTX assays show good precision and low analytical CV, and, compared to other markers, they can acceptably reflect bone metabolic processes and promptly respond to antiosteoporotic treatments. We trust that this sensitive marker can be useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy and can overcome the pitfalls due to wide variability in the normal values of most BTMs that create difficulty in pinpointing the individual patient's response.

Abstract: Enhancing the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is especially important when times to engraftment are prolonged due either to limiting numbers of HSC in the donor graft or to intrinsic slower engrafting time of the tissue sources of HSC. Both inhibition of dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP) 4/CD26 and treatment of cells with 16,16 dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) have been shown to enhance hematopoietic stem cell engraftment in murine transplantation models and have been evaluated in clinical settings for their influence on engraftment of cord blood cells, a tissue source of HSC known to manifest an extended time to engraftment of donor cells compared to that of bone marrow (BM) and mobilized peripheral blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Herein, we present new experimental data, using a CD45+ head-to-head congenic model of donor mouse BM cells for engraftment of lethally irradiated mice, demonstrating that similar levels of enhanced engraftment are detected by pulsing donor BM cells with diprotin A, a DPP4 inhibitor, or with dmPGE2 prior to infusion, or by pretreating recipient mice with sitagliptin, also a DPP4 inhibitor, by oral gavage. Moreover, the combined effects of pretreating the donor BM cells with dmPGE2 in context of pretreating the recipient mice with sitagliptin after the administration of a lethal dose of radiation resulted in significantly enhanced competitively repopulating HCT compared to either treatment alone. This information is highly relevant to the goal of enhancing engraftment in human clinical HCT.

Abstract: Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is the most commonly used reporter of expression in cell biology despite evidence that it affects the cell physiology. The molecular mechanism of GFP-associated modifications has been largely unexplored. In this paper we investigated the proteome modifications following stable expression of GFP in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). A combination of three different proteome analysis methods (2-DE, iTRAQ, label-free) was used to maximise proteome coverage. We found that GFP expression induces changes in expression of proteins that are associated with protein folding, cytoskeletal organisation and cellular immune response. In view of these findings, the use of GFP as a cell reporter should be carefully monitored.

Abstract: Although several mechanisms behind resistance to docetaxel in castration-refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) have been investigated, molecular determinants of evolved resistance are still not entirely understood. Proteomics-based analysis in this study revealed that SOD2, associated with downregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), was significantly up-regulated in docetaxel-resistant (PC3/Doc) cells if compared to sensitive cells, and the expression of redox-regulated genes such as IGF-1R, CXCR4, and BCL2 was increased as well. Forced expression of SOD2 in sensitive cells led to the increase of IGF-1R and association with drug resistance, whereas silencing of SOD2 resulted in the decrease of IGF-1R at the protein level in resistant cells. Further study revealed that SOD2 acted as a negative regulator of β-arrestin1 that is an important adaptor responsible for degradation of IGF-1R via the changes in ROS, as evidenced by observations that an antioxidant agent substantially attenuated β-arrestin1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we found that blocking of IL6 that was up-regulated in resistant cells resulted in attenuation of SOD2 and STAT3, and simultaneously in increased expression of β-arrestin1. The modulation consequently led to the decreased IGF-1R at both protein and transcription levels. Together, our data provide a novel explanation that high level of IL6 stimulated SOD2 expression that, at least partially, contributed to the low level of ROS that would likely result in a sustained increase in the expression of IGF-1R through abolishment of β-arrestin1 in docetaxel resistant cells.

Abstract: AEBart's disease is a thalassemia intermedia usually characterized by the interaction of α0-thalassemia with either deletional or non-deletional α+-thalassemia in Hb E heterozygote. Genotypic and phenotypic features are heterogeneous. We studied the hematologic and molecular characteristics of this disease in a cohort of 173 Thai patients encountered at our center in northeast Thailand. Hemoglobin and DNA analyses identified patients with deletional AEBart's disease (n=84), Hb Constant Spring AEBart's disease (n=81), Hb Paksé-AEBart's disease (n=5), AEBart's disease with codon 30 mutation (n=1) and two hitherto un-described forms of AEBart's disease due to interaction of Hb E heterozygote and α0-thalassemia with the −α16.6kb deletional α+-thalassemia (n=1) and Hb Q-Thailand (n=1). Different phenotypic expression of these AEBart's diseases with low Hb, Hct and MCV and increased RDW values with marked reduction in Hb E levels were observed. It was found that all these forms of AEBart's disease showed similar thalassemia intermedia phenotypes but those with non-deletional forms were relatively more anemic. Our data confirm that in such area with high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies such as Southeast Asia, identification of rare thalassemia alleles in a thalassemia intermedia patient should not be ignored. Careful consideration of different phenotypic expression may help in providing presumptive diagnosis of this disease where access to molecular testing is limited. However, molecular diagnostic is useful for predicting the clinical outcome and improving genetic counseling of these complex hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Hepcidin, a peptide hormone produced in the liver, decreases intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release via effects on ferroportin. Bone morphogenic protein and Stat3 signaling regulate Hepcidin's transcription. Hepcidin is a potential drug target for patients with iron overload syndromes because its levels are inappropriately low in these individuals. To generate a tool for identifying small molecules that modulate Hepcidin expression, we stably transfected human hepatocytes (HepG2) cells with a reporter construct containing 2.7kb of the human Hepcidin promoter upstream of a firefly reporter gene. We used high throughput methods to screen 10,169 chemicals in duplicate for their effect on Hepcidin expression and cell viability. Regulators were identified as chemicals that caused a change >3 standard deviations above or >1 standard deviation below the mean of the other chemicals (z-score >3 or <1), while not adversely affecting cell viability, quantified by fluorescence assay. Following validation assays, we identified 16 chemicals in a broad range of functional classes that promote Hepcidin expression. All of the chemicals identified increased expression of bone morphogenic protein-dependent and/or Stat3-dependent genes, however none of them strongly increased phosphorylation of Smad1,5,8 or Stat3.

Abstract: Although the molecular basis of variability of hemoglobin (Hb) F has been extensively examined in β-thalassemia and sickle cell diseases, less study has been done on Hb E disorder. To address the variability of Hb F expression in Hb EE disease, we have examined multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the β-globin gene cluster, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB genes and determined their associations with Hb F levels in this syndrome. Study was done on 141 adult Thai individuals with homozygous Hb E. Hematological parameters were recorded and Hb F measured using Hb-HPLC analyzer. It was found in 26 cases that co-inheritance of α-thalassemia could lead to significant lower production of Hb F. Association of Hb F expression with the Gγ-Xmn I polymorphism and other SNPs including rs2297339, rs2838513, rs4895441 and rs9399137 in HBS1L-MYB gene and rs4671393 and rs11886868 in BCL11A gene was therefore analyzed in the remaining 115 cases without α-thalassemia. It was found that 4 of these 7 SNPs including Gγ-XmnI polymorphism (rs7482144), HBS1L-MYB (rs4895441) and (rs9399137) and BCL11A (rs4671393) were significantly associated with higher proportions of subjects with high Hb F (Hb F≥5%). The result demonstrated that multiple genetic modifying factors including T allele of Gγ-XmnI polymorphism (rs7482144), G allele of HBS1L-MYB (rs489441), C allele of HBS1L-MYB (rs9399137) and C allele of BCL11A (rs4671393) are associated with increased Hb F and in combination could explain approximately 80% of the variation of Hb F in Hb EE disease in Thai population. Other genetic factors regulating Hb F expression in this common genetic disorder remains to be elucidated.

Abstract: Oncomarkers play important roles in the detection and management of human malignancies. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CEACAM5) and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) are considered as independent tumor markers in monitoring metastatic colorectal cancer. They are both expressed by cancer cells and can be detected in the blood serum. We investigated the effect of CEA production by MIP101 colorectal carcinoma cell lines on E-cadherin adherens junction (AJ) protein complexes. No direct interaction between E-cadherin and CEA was detected; however, the functional relationships between E-cadherin and its AJ partners: α-, β- and p120 catenins were impaired. We discovered a novel interaction between CEA and beta-catenin protein in the CEA producing cells. It is shown in the current study that CEA overexpression alters the splicing of p120 catenin and triggers the release of soluble E-cadherin. The influence of CEA production by colorectal cancer cells on the function of E-cadherin junction complexes may explain the link between the elevated levels of CEA and the increase in soluble E-cadherin during the progression of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE3 colocalizes with beta-actin at the leading edge of directionally migrating cells. Using human osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2), rat osteoblasts (calvaria), and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, we identified a novel role for NHE3 via beta-actin in anode and cathode directed motility, during electrotaxis. NHE3 knockdown by RNAi revealed that NHE3 expression is required to achieve constant directionality and polarity in migrating cells. Phosphorylated NHE3 (pNHE3) and beta-actin complex formation was impaired by the NHE3 inhibitor S3226 (IC50 0.02µM). Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) revealed that the molecular interactions between NHE3 and beta-actin in membrane protrusions increased 1.7-fold in the presence of a directional cue and decreased 3.3-fold in the presence of cytochalasin D. Data from flow cytometric analysis showed that membrane potential of cells (Vmem) decreases in directionally migrating, NHE3-deficient osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cells whereas only Vmem of wild type osteoblasts is affected during directional migration. These findings suggest that pNHE3 has a mechanical function via beta-actin that is dependent on its physiological activity and Vmem. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) levels increase while PIP2 remains stable when cells have persistent directionality. Both PI3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt expression levels change proportionally to NHE3 levels. Interestingly, however, the content of pNHE3 level does not change when PI3K/Akt is inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that NHE3 can act as a direction sensor for cells and that NHE3 phosphorylation in persistent directional cell migration does not involve PI3K/Akt during electrotaxis.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked incompletely dominant enzyme deficiency that results from G6PD gene mutations. Women heterozygous for G6PD mutations exhibit variation in the loss of enzyme activity but the cause of this phenotypic variation is unclear. We determined DNA methylation and X-inactivation patterns in 71 G6PD-deficient female heterozygotes and 68 G6PD non-deficient controls with the same missense mutations (G6PD Canton c.1376G>T or Kaiping c.1388G>A) to correlate determinants with variable phenotypes. Specific CpG methylations within the G6PD promoter were significantly higher in G6PD-deficient heterozygotes than in controls. Preferential X-inactivation of the G6PD wild-type allele was determined in heterozygotes. The incidence of preferential X-inactivation was 86.2% in the deficient heterozygote group and 31.7% in the non-deficient heterozygote group. A significant negative correlation was observed between X-inactivation ratios of the wild-type allele and G6PD/6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) ratios in heterozygous G6PD Canton (r=−0.657, p<0.001) or Kaiping (r=−0.668, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that heterozygotes with hypermethylation of specific CpG sites in the G6PD promoter and preferential X-inactivation of the wild-type allele were at risk of enzyme deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Robust immune responses are essential for eliminating pathogens but must be metered to avoid prolonged immune activation and potential host damage. Upon recognition of microbial DNA, the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthetase (cGAS) produces the second messenger cGAMP to initiate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and subsequent interferon (IFN) production. We report that the direct interaction between cGAS and the Beclin-1 autophagy protein not only suppresses cGAMP synthesis to halt IFN production upon double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) stimulation or herpes simplex virus-1 infection, but also enhances autophagy-mediated degradation of cytosolic pathogen DNA to prevent excessive cGAS activation and persistent immune stimulation. Specifically, this interaction releases Rubicon, a negative autophagy regulator, from the Beclin-1 complex, activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III activity and thereby inducing autophagy to remove cytosolic pathogen DNA. Thus, the cGAS-Beclin-1 interaction shapes innate immune responses by regulating both cGAMP production and autophagy, resulting in well-balanced antimicrobial immune responses.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in various aspects of cancer cell biology, yet their role in cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been poorly understood. In particular, it still remains unclear whether and how ROS control the self-renewal/differentiation process and the tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. Here we show that ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK plays a pivotal role in the control of differentiation and tumor-initiating capacity of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) derived from human glioblastomas. Mechanistically, ROS triggered p38-dependent Bmi1 protein degradation and FoxO3 activation in GICs, which were shown to be responsible for the loss of their self-renewal capacity and differentiation, respectively. Thus, the results suggest that Bmi1 and FoxO3 govern distinct phases of transition from undifferentiated to fully differentiated cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate in this study that oxidative stress deprives GICs of their tumor-initiating capacity through the activation of the ROS–p38 axis. As such, this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to delineate how ROS control self-renewal/differentiation and the tumor-initiating capacity of stem-like cancer cells. This study also suggests that targeting of the ROS–p38 axis could be a novel approach in the development of therapeutic strategies against gliomas, represented by glioblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria use a type three secretion apparatus (T3SA) to translocate effector proteins into host cells. Detecting and monitoring the T3SA of intracellular bacteria within intact host cells has been challenging. Taking advantage of the tight coupling between T3S effector-gene transcription and T3SA activity in Shigella flexneri, together with a fast-maturing green fluorescent protein, we developed reporters to monitor T3SA activity in real time. These reporters reveal a dynamic temporal regulation of the T3SA during the course of infection. T3SA is activated initially during bacterial entry and downregulated subsequently when bacteria gain access to the host cell cytoplasm, allowing replenishment of the bacterial stores of T3S substrates necessary for invading neighboring cells. Reactivation of the T3SA was strictly dependent on actin-based motility and formation of plasma membrane protrusions during cell-to-cell spread. Thus, the T3SA is subject to a tight on/off regulation within the bacterial intracellular niche.

Abstract: Although various coagulation abnormalities occur in patients with Gaucher disease (GD), von Willebrand factor (vWF) deficiency has rarely been reported. A retrospective review of six treatment naïve cases with GD and concomitant vWF deficiency over a 12-year-period in a single center is presented. All patients had a personal history of prior hemorrhages. Based on both reduced level of vWF antigen (vWF:Ag, range 14–56%) and ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo, range 12–53%), with a vWF:RCo/Ag ratio >0.7, the diagnosis of type 1 von Willebrand disease was made in all six cases. During enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of a 2-year duration all patients normalized their vWF:Ag levels. Based on the positive ERT effect on vWF:Ag levels, vWF deficiency was assumed to be acquired. It should be noted that beside vWF deficiency four patients with GD exhibited mild thrombocytopenia (range 81–131×109/L) and three had additional hemostatic defects (reduced collagen platelet aggregation, FV, FXI and FXII deficiencies).

Abstract: Microtubule dynamics are important for a variety of key cellular functions such as intracellular trafficking, adjustment of the cell surface proteome, or adhesion structure turnover. In the current study, we investigate the effects of altered microtubule acetylation levels on the subcellular distribution of kinesins and actin cytoskeletal architecture in primary human macrophages. Microtubule acetylation was altered by overexpression or siRNA-induced depletion of the acetylase MEC-17, or by blocking α-tubulin deacetylation by addition of the inhibitor tubacin. We show that microtubule acetylation influences the subcellular distribution of vesicles associated with the kinesin KIF1C, as well as their directionality, velocity and run length. Moreover, tubulin acetylation alters the targeting frequency of microtubule plus ends on podosomes and influences the number of podosomes per cell and thus the matrix-degrading capacity of macrophages. Collectively, our results point to α-tubulin acetylation as an important modification that impacts on kinesin vesicle dynamics, actin cytoskeletal architecture and cellular function of macrophages.

Abstract: Abundant clinical evidences indicate that up-regulation of several cathepsins in many human cancers is correlated with malignant progression and poor patient prognosis. In addition, a decrease in catalase activity or accumulation of hydrogen peroxide correlates with cancer metastasis. Recent studies indicate that cathepsin activation and expression can be modulated via H2O2 treatment. However, the actual relationship between catalase and cathepsins is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that catalase expression (or activity) was higher, while intracellular and extracellular Cat S, Cat L, and Cat K activities were lower in the non-invasive CL1-0 cells compared to the highly invasive CL1-5 cells. After CL1-0 cells were transfected with catalase-shRNA, the corresponding ROS (H2O2) level and Cat S, Cat L, or Cat K expression (or activity) was up-regulated, accompanied by an increase in cell migration and invasion. On the other hand, ROS (H2O2) level, cathepsin S, L, and K activities, cell migration and invasion were decreased in catalase-overexpressed CL1-5 cells. It is suggested that catalase may regulate cathepsin activity by controlling the production of ROS (H2O2), leading to variation in migration and invasion ability of lung cancer cells.

Abstract: Toward developing biologically sound models for the study of heart regeneration and disease, we cultured heart cells on a biodegradable, microfabricated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) scaffold designed with micro-structural features and anisotropic mechanical properties to promote cardiac-like tissue architecture. Using this biomimetic system, we studied individual and combined effects of supplemental insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and electrical stimulation (ES). On culture day 8, all tissue constructs could be paced and expressed the cardiac protein troponin-T. IGF-1 reduced apoptosis, promoted cell-to-cell connectivity, and lowered excitation threshold, an index of electrophysiological activity. ES promoted formation of tissue-like bundles oriented in parallel to the electrical field and a more than ten-fold increase in matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) gene expression. The combination of IGF-1 and ES increased 2D projection length, an index of overall contraction strength, and enhanced expression of the gap junction protein connexin-43 and sarcomere development. This culture environment, designed to combine cardiac-like scaffold architecture and biomechanics with molecular and biophysical signals, enabled functional assembly of engineered heart muscle from dissociated cells and could serve as a template for future studies on the hierarchy of various signaling domains relative to cardiac tissue development.

Abstract: Aromatic aldehydes like o-vanillin were designed to reduce the complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) by interaction with HbS, to reduce polymerisation and RBC sickling. Present results show that o-vanillin also directly affects RBC membrane permeability. Both the K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC) and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (or Gardos channel) were inhibited with IC50 of about 0.3 and 1mM, respectively, with activities almost completely abolished by 5mM. Similar effects were observed in RBCs treated with the thiol reacting reagent N-ethylmaleimide or with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, to circumvent any action via HbS polymerisation. The deoxygenation-induced cation conductance (sometimes termed Psickle) was partially inhibited, whilst deoxygenation-induced exposure of phosphatidylserine was completely abrogated. Na+/K+ pump activity was also reduced. Notwithstanding, o-vanillin stimulated K+ efflux through an unidentified pathway and resulted in reduction in cell volume (as measured by wet weight−dry weight). These actions are relevant to understanding how aromatic aldehydes may affect RBC membrane permeability per se as well as HbS polymerisation and thereby inform design of compounds most efficacious in ameliorating the complications of SCD.

Abstract: The availability of three iron chelators improved the scenario of chelation therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients, allowing tailoring of drugs according to the goals expected for each patient. The use of Deferiprone/Deferoxamine (DFP/DFO) combined in different schemes has been reported since many years. Only recently data from combination of Deferasirox/Deferoxamine (DFX/DFO) have been reported showing that it can be safe and efficacious to remove iron overload, particularly in patients who do not respond adequately to a single chelating agent. We investigated the efficacy, tolerability and safety of combined DFX/DFO in thalassemia major patients. Ten TDT patients have started DFX/DFO for different reasons: 1) lack of efficacy in removing liver/cardiac iron with monotherapy; 2) agranulocytosis on DFP; and 3) adverse events with elevated doses of monotherapies. The study design included: cardiac and hepatic T2* magnetic resonance (CMR), transient elastography evaluation (Fibroscan), biochemical evaluation, and audiometric and ocular examinations. The drugs' starting doses were: DFO 32±4mg/kg/day for 3–4days a week and DFX 20±2mg/kg/day. Seven patients completed the one-year follow-up period. At baseline the mean pre-transfusional Hb level was 9.4±0.4g/dl, the mean iron intake was 0.40±0.10mg/kg/day, the median ferritin level was 2254ng/ml (range 644–17,681ng/ml). Data available at 1year showed no alteration of renal/hepatic function and no adverse events. A marked reduction in LIC (6.54 vs 11.44mg/g dw at baseline) and in median ferritin (1346 vs 2254ng/ml at baseline) was achieved. A concomitant reduction of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) at six months was observed (2.1±1.0 vs 1.7±1.2μM). An improvement in cardiac T2* values was detected (26.34±15.85 vs 19.85±12.06 at baseline). At 1year an increased dose of DFX was administered (27±6mg/kg/day vs 20±2mg/kg/day at baseline, p=0.01) with a stable dose of DFO (32±4mg/kg/day). Combined or alternated DFX/DFO can be considered when monotherapy is not able to remove the iron overload or in the presence of adverse events.

Abstract: Recombinant human acid β-glucosidase GBA (rhGBA) infusion is an effective therapy for non-neuropathic (type I) Gaucher disease (GD), but its effect on subacute neuropathic (type III) GD is still controversial. The most common genotype for type III GD is homozygous c.1448T>C (p.L444P) mutation, and in this study, we treated seven such patients starting from an early age (median 2.1years; range 1–2.9years). Before the start of treatment, all patients presented hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but with no neurological signs. Normalization of hemoglobin levels and platelet numbers was achieved in all patients in one year. However, after a median treatment period of 7.6years (2.2–12.0years), two patients developed horizontal gaze palsy, one had seizures, four demonstrated mental retardation, and five showed kyphosis. Moreover, lymphadenopathy in the neck, thorax, or abdomen was observed in four patients. Therefore, the progression of neurological symptoms in these patients probably reflected the neurologic natural history of type III GD. Residual somatic symptoms, including kyphosis and lymphadenopathy, may be more common than what we thought. An additional treatment will be necessary to improve the outcome of type III GD.

Abstract: Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells with the capacity for unlimited self-renewal or differentiation. Inhibition of MAPK pathways enhances mouse ES cell pluripotency characteristics. Compared to wildtype ES cells, jnk2−/− ES cells displayed a much higher growth rate. To determine whether JNKs are required for stem cell self-renewal or differentiation, we performed a phosphorylation kinase array assay to compare mouse ES cells under LIF+ or LIF− culture conditions. The data showed that activation of JNKs was induced by LIF withdrawal. We also found that JNK1 or 2 phosphorylated Klf4 at threonines 224 and 225. Activation of JNK signaling and phosphorylation of Klf4 inhibited Klf4 transcription and transactivation activity. Importantly, jnk1−/− and jnk2−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited a significantly greater potency in the ability to increase the number of iPS colonies compared with jnk wildtype MEFs. Overall, our results demonstrated that JNK1 and 2 play a negative role in reprogramming to pluripotent stem cells by suppressing Klf4 activity.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn-2) also suppresses VSMC proliferation through Ras-Raf-ERK/MAPK, suggesting a possible link between EGCG, Mfn-2 and ERK/MAPK. However, the effect of EGCG on Mfn-2 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Mfn-2 in the regulation of VSMC proliferation by EGCG, and assessed the underlying mechanisms. The effects of EGCG on the proliferation of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were observed by 5-ethynl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay. Mfn-2 gene and protein levels, and Ras, p-c-Raf and p-ERK1/2 protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Mfn-2 gene silencing was achieved by RNA interference. EGCG 50μmol/L profoundly inhibited the proliferation of HASMCs in culture, up-regulated Mfn-2, and down-regulated the expression of p-c-Raf and p-ERK1/2. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown of Mfn-2 antagonized EGCG-induced anti-proliferation and down-regulation of Ras, p-c-Raf and p-ERK1/2. These results suggest that EGCG inhibits the proliferation of HASMCs in vitro largely via Mfn-2-mediated suppression of the Ras-Raf-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. In the present study, we found that miR-125a was dramatically down-regulated during macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclastogenesis of circulating CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Overexpression of miR-125a in CD14+ PBMCs inhibited osteoclastogenesis, while inhibition of miR-125a promoted osteoclastogenesis. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a transduction factor for RANKL/RANK/NFATc1 signal, was confirmed to be a target of miR-125a. EMSA and ChIP assays confirmed that NFATc1 bound to the promoter of the miR-125a. Overexpression of NFATc1 inhibited miR-125a transcription, and block of NFATc1 expression attenuated RANKL-regulated miR-125a transcription. Here, we reported that miR-125a played a biological function in osteoclastogenesis through a novel TRAF6/ NFATc1/miR-125a regulatory feedback loop. It suggests that regulation of miR-125a expression may be a potential strategy for ameliorating metabolic disease.

Clarifying and defining heterogeneities in vitro among perivascular cells could lead to improved cell-based tissue regeneration strategies and a better understanding of human developmental processes. We studied contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), synthetic vSMCs, and pericytes derived from a common human pluripotent stem cell source. Using in vitro cultures, we show unique cell morphology, subcellular organelle organization (namely endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and stress fibers), and expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and elastin for each cell type. While differences in extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling were less pronounced, the multipotency, in vivo, migratory, invasion, and contractile functionalities are distinctive for each cell type. Overall, we define a repertoire of functional phenotypes in vitro specific for each of the human perivascular cell types, enabling their study and use in basic and translational research.

Abstract: Plasmalogens represent a unique class of phospholipids. Reduced red blood cell plasmalogen levels in Gaucher disease patients were reported, correlating to total disease burden. The relation between plasmalogen abnormalities in Gaucher disease patients and primary glycosphingolipid abnormalities, malonyldialdehyde levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, and the total antioxidant status was further investigated. Significant reduction of C16:0 and C18:0 plasmalogens in red blood cells of Gaucher disease patients was confirmed. In parallel, a significant increase in the glucosylceramide/ceramide ratio in red blood cell membranes, as well as an average 200-fold increase in plasma glucosylsphingosine levels was observed. Red blood cell malonyldialdehyde levels were significantly increased in patients, whereas their total antioxidant status was significantly reduced. A negative correlation between plasmalogen species and glucosylceramide, ceramide, glucosylceramide/ceramide ratio, glucosylsphingosine and malonyldialdehyde, significant for the C16:0 species and all the above parameters with the exception of malonyldialdehyde levels, was found along with a positive non-significant correlation with the total antioxidant status. Our results indicate that increased lipid peroxidation and reduced total antioxidant status exist in Gaucher disease patients. They demonstrate a clear link between plasmalogen levels and the primary glycolipid abnormalities characterizing the disorder and an association with the increased oxidative stress observed in Gaucher disease patients.

Abstract: The canonical transient receptor potential-6 (TRPC6) is a receptor-activated non-selective Ca2+ channel regulated by a variety of modulators such as diacylglycerol, Ca2+/calmodulin or phosphorylation. The present study is aimed to investigate whether different situations, such as acidic pH, exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or hypoxic-like conditions modulate TRPC6 channel function. Here we show normal aggregation and Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by thrombin in TRPC6 KO platelets; however, OAG (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol)-evoked Ca2+ entry was attenuated in the absence of TRPC6. Exposure of mouse platelets to acidic pH resulted in abolishment of thrombin-evoked aggregation and attenuated platelet aggregation induced by thapsigargin (TG) or OAG. Both OAG-induced Ca2+ entry and platelet aggregation were greatly attenuated in cells expressing TRPC6 channels. Exposure of platelets to H2O2 or deferoxamine did not clearly alter thrombin, TG or OAG-induced platelet aggregation. Our results indicate that TRPC6 is sensitive to acidic pH but not to exposure to ROS or hypoxic-like conditions, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of the altered platelet responsiveness to DAG-generating agonists in disorders associated to acidic pH.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia is a critical risk factor for development and progression of breast cancer. We have recently reported that high glucose induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser 10 as well as de-phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser 9 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying hyperglycemia-induced proliferation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We provide evidence that hyperglycemia led to increased DNA methylation and DNMT1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. High glucose condition led to significant increase in the expression of PCNA, cyclin D1 and decrease in the expression of PTPN 12, p21 and PTEN. It also induced hypermethylation of DNA at the promoter region of PTPN 12, whereas hypomethylation at Vimentin and Snail. Silencing of GSK-3β by siRNA prevented histone H3 phosphorylation and reduced DNMT1 expression. We show that chromatin obtained after immunoprecipitation with phospho-histone H3 was hypermethylated under high glucose condition, which indicates a cross-talk between DNA methylation and histone H3 phosphorylation. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed up-regulation of DNMT1 and metastatic genes viz. Vimentin, Snail and MMP-7 by phospho-histone H3, which were down-regulated upon GSK-3β silencing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which shows that interplay between GSK-3β activation, histone H3 phosphorylation and DNA methylation directs proliferation of breast cancer cells.

Abstract: MARK4 is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates MAP proteins, increasing microtubule dynamics. MARK4 differs from the other members of the MARK family for encoding two isoforms (MARK4L and MARK4S), differentially expressed in the nervous system, and for the peculiar localisation at the centrosome and the midbody. By cytofluorimetric analysis we showed that MARK4 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and preferentially activated during mitosis. Depletion of MARK4S affected the morphology and proliferation of fibroblasts and glioma cells, as the percentages of cells in S and G2/M phases were reduced and the percentage of cells in G1 was increased. In MARK4S silenced cells, centrosomes were duplicated and positioned apically to the nucleus, indicating that the centrosome cycle was altered and the cells arrested in G1 phase. Overexpression of MARK4L or MARK4S reduced the density of the microtubule network, confirming microtubules as the main target of MARK4, and revealed a novel co-localisation of MARK4 and vimentin. Taken together, our data confirm that MARK4 is a key component in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and highlight its major role in cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S transition. The co-localisation of vimentin and MARK4L suggests that MARK4 has a wide-ranging influence on cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Background
The “gray zone” of borderline hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2) may be present in a large section of the population, especially in countries where thalassemia is common. However, very little is currently known of the molecular basis of borderline Hb A2 in Chinese individuals.
Method
In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the globin genotypes and KLF1 gene mutations associated with borderline Hb A2 in 165 Chinese subjects.
Result
Fifteen (9.1%) were positive for a molecular defect in the α-,β-globin genes, of whom, α-thalassemia mutations and α-globin gene triplication were found in eleven cases, accounting for about 73.3% of these globin gene defects. Twenty (12.1%) were positive for a molecular defect in the KLF1 gene. Eight different mutations were identified, six of which are here reported for the first time. The most common is the G176AfsX179 mutation, accounting for 50% of the total.
Conclusions
The molecular characterization of borderline Hb A2 in Chinese individuals is significantly different than in Italian population. Our data is conductive to provision of genetic counseling for Chinese individuals with borderline Hb A2.

Abstract: In this study, we have examined CKS1B gene expression and copy number in a total of 114- patients at diagnosis: 83 with multiple myeloma (MM) and 31 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Results were correlated with cytogenetics, FISH and clinical characteristic. Significant CKS1B mRNA levels in MM compared to MGUS cases (p<0.048) were detected. In MM, the frequency of 1q21 (CKS1B) copy gain was significantly higher in cases with abnormal karyotype compared to patients with normal karyotype (p=0.021). Global analysis showed a positive correlation between CKS1B expression and 1q21 copy number (p<0.0001). No association between CKS1B mRNA expression and clinical parameters was found. However, a significantly higher level of β2 microglobulin in cases with 1q21 gains than those without (p=0.0094) was observed. Overall survival was shorter in cases with 1q21 gain compared to those with normal 1q21 region (p=0.0082). Our results suggest a role for CKS1B in the multiple step process of progression of MGUS to MM and show that CKS1B copy gain has a more significant prognostic value than its overexpression. This adverse impact on survival probably reflects the genetic instability associated to chromosome 1q alterations resulting in a more aggressive behavior of the disease.

Abstract: Studying the proliferative ability of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in hypoxic conditions can help us achieve the effective regeneration of ischemic injured myocardium. Cardiac-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP3) is a specific biomarker of muscle and heart tissue injury. This protein is purported to be involved in early myocardial development, adult myocardial tissue repair and responsible for the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. We have investigated the role of FABP3 in human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells under ischemic conditions. MSCs from 12 donors were cultured either in standard normoxic or modified hypoxic conditions, and the differential expression of FABP3 was tested by quantitative RTPCR and western blot. We also established stable FABP3 expression in MSCs and searched for variation in cellular proliferation and differentiation bioprocesses affected by hypoxic conditions. We identified: (1) the FABP3 differential expression pattern in the MSCs under hypoxic conditions; (2) over-expression of FABP3 inhibited the growth and proliferation of the MSCs; however, improved their survival in low oxygen environments; (3) the cell growth factors and positive cell cycle regulation genes, such as PCNA, APC, CCNB1, CCNB2 and CDC6 were all down-regulated; while the key negative cell cycle regulation genes TP53, BRCA1, CASP3 and CDKN1A were significantly up-regulated in the cells with FABP3 overexpression. Our data suggested that FABP3 was up-regulated under hypoxia; also negatively regulated the cell metabolic process and the mitotic cell cycle. Overexpression of FABP3 inhibited cell growth and proliferation via negative regulation of the cell cycle and down-regulation of cell growth factors, but enhances cell survival in hypoxic or ischemic conditions.

Abstract: Increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) may reduce sickle cell anemia severity due to its ability to inhibit HbS polymerization and also reduce the mean corpuscular HbS concentration. We have investigated the influence of three known major loci on the HbF trait (HBG2, rs748214; BCL11A, rs4671393; and HBS1L-MYB, rs28384513, rs489544 and rs9399137) and HbF levels in SCA patients from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil. Our results showed that high levels of HbF were primarily influenced by alleles of BCL11A (rs4671393) and HMIP (rs4895441) loci, and to a lesser extent by rs748214 Gγ-globin (HBG2) gene promoter. The SNPs rs4671393 and rs4895441 explained 10% and 9.2%, respectively, of the variation in HbF levels, while 4.1% of trait variation was explained by rs748214. The results can be considered as in accordance with the pattern of ancestry displayed by the SCA patients: 39.6% European, 29.6% African and 30.8% Native American, and reinforce the suggestion that studies of association between genetic modifiers and clinical and laboratory manifestations in Brazil must be controlled by ancestry.

Abstract: In vitro stimulation of HSCs with growth factors generally leads to their depletion. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying expansion of HSCs in vivo following myeloablation could lead to successful expansion of HSCs ex vivo for therapeutic purposes. Current findings show that mTORC1 is activated in HSPCs following 5-fluorouracil treatment and that mTORC1 activation is dependent on mitochondrial ETC capacity of HSPCs. Moreover, expression of PGC-1 family members, proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, in HSPCs following 5-fluorouracil treatment changes; also, these proteins play a stage specific role in hematopoietic recovery. While PRC regulates HSCs' expansion during early recovery phase, PGC-1α regulates progenitor cell proliferation and recovery of hematopoiesis during later phase. During early recovery phase, PRC expression, mitochondrial activity and mTORC1 activation are relatively higher in PGC-1α−/− HSCs compared to WT HSCs, and PGC-1α−/− HSCs show greater expansion. Administration of rapamycin, but not NAC, during early recovery phase improves WT HSC numbers but decreases PGC-1α−/− HSC numbers. The current findings demonstrate that mTOR activation can increase HSC numbers provided that the energy demand created by mTOR activation is successfully met. Thus, critical tuning between mTORC1 activation and mitochondrial ETC capacity is crucial for HSC maintenance/expansion in response to mitogenic stimulation.

Abstract: Changes in basal laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) of skin blood flow in sickle cell disease are reported to have pathophysiologic relevance in pain crisis. This is the first study to strictly control for LDF variability in determining the value of serial, basal (unprovoked) skin LDF as a practical method to assess resolution of acute pain crisis in sickle cell patients. Daily LDF measurements were repeated on the exact same skin areas of the calf and forehead throughout each of 12 hospital admissions for uncomplicated acute pain crisis. A progressive increase in perfusion was observed in the calf throughout hospitalization as pain crisis resolved, but measurement reproducibility in the calf was poor. Reproducibility in the forehead was better, but no significant trend over time in perfusion was seen. There was no significant correlation between perfusion and pain scores over time. There was also no significant pattern of LDF oscillations over time. In conclusion, only perfusion units and not oscillatory patterns of LDF have probable pathophysiological significance in sickle cell disease vaso-occlusion. The reproducibility of basal skin LDF specifically in sickle cell disease needs to be confirmed.

Abstract: Background
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a heterogeneous disease that includes multiple subtypes is defined by cell lineage and chromosome anomalies. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes.
Methods
We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls. Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were analyzed for association with childhood ALL.
Results
The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01–2.87, P=0.049).
Conclusion
HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. We found that rs7073837 in ARID5B correlated with a risk for childhood B lineage ALL.

Furin processing dictates ectodomain shedding of human FAT1 cadherin,

Abstract: Fat1 is a single pass transmembrane protein and the largest member of the cadherin superfamily. Mouse knockout models and in vitro studies have suggested that Fat1 influences cell polarity and motility. Fat1 is also an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, at least in lower vertebrates, and hence may play a role in growth control. In previous work we have established that FAT1 cadherin is initially cleaved by proprotein convertases to form a noncovalently linked heterodimer prior to expression on the cell surface. Such processing was not a requirement for cell surface expression, since melanoma cells expressed both unprocessed FAT1 and the heterodimer on the cell surface. Here we further establish that the site 1 (S1) cleavage step to promote FAT1 heterodimerisation is catalysed by furin and we identify the cleavage site utilised. For a number of other transmembrane receptors that undergo heterodimerisation the S1 processing step is thought to occur constitutively but the functional significance of heterodimerisation has been controversial. It has also been generally unclear as to the significance of receptor heterodimerisation with respect to subsequent post-translational proteolysis that often occurs in transmembrane proteins. Exploiting the partial deficiency of FAT1 processing in melanoma cells together with furin-deficient LoVo cells, we manipulated furin expression to demonstrate that only the heterodimer form of FAT1 is subject to cleavage and subsequent release of the extracellular domain. This work establishes S1-processing as a clear functional prerequisite for ectodomain shedding of FAT1 with general implications for the shedding of other transmembrane receptors.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of glucosylceramide in macrophages, so-called Gaucher cells, as a result of a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Bone complications are an important cause of morbidity of GD and are thought to result from imbalance in bone remodeling. Bone manifestations among GD patients demonstrate a large variation including increased osteoclastic bone resorption, low bone formation and osteonecrosis. The purpose of the current case series is to describe the histological features observed in undecalcified bone samples, obtained from three GD patients, and evaluate the relationship with clinical features in these patients. Bone fragments were obtained from three adult type 1 GD patients with variable degrees of bone disease during orthopedic surgery. Specimens were embedded without prior decalcification in methylmethacrylate and prepared for histology according to standardized laboratory procedures. Histology revealed a heterogeneous pattern of bone involvement. High cellularity of bone marrow, abundant presence of Gaucher cells (GCs) and high turnover were observed in a patient with a history of multiple bone complications, while minimal bone turnover and few GCs were detected in the mildest affected patient in this series. An intermediate picture with relatively low bone turnover and a substantial amount of Gaucher cells was demonstrated in the third, moderately affected patient. No gross abnormalities in three biochemical markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin, N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen and type 1 collagen C-terminal telopeptide) were noted. Plastic embedding and subsequent Goldner and TRAP staining offered a unique possibility to study bone histological findings in GD. Our data show that bone manifestations in GD may vary both clinically as well as histologically and bone disease in GD will likely require a personalized approach.

Abstract: Acquired factor X (FX) deficiency unrelated to amyloidosis is a rare disorder in which an anti-FX antibody is infrequently detected. A patient with severe bleeding due to a calcium ion-dependent anti-FX IgG antibody is described. The FX affinity purified IgG bound the light chain of FX, but not FX lacking its γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain, and binding was enhanced >1000-fold in the presence of calcium ions. The antibody also recognized prothrombin and factor VII with about 100-fold and 1000-fold lower affinity. Like a lupus anticoagulant, increasing concentrations of phospholipids in functional assays reduced the inhibitory activity of the antibody. The effect of these properties of the inhibitor on laboratory diagnostic studies is considered.

Abstract: The CysLT2 receptor is involved in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, differentiation of colorectal cancers, bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. However, the signal transduction of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2) in inflammatory responses remains to be clarified. In HEK293 cells stably expressing hCysLT1, hCysLT2 and rGPR17, we determined the signaling pathways for interleukin-8 (IL-8) production after CysLT2 receptor activation. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with the recombinant plasmids of pcDNA3.1(+)-hCysLT1, pcDNA3.1(+)-hCysLT2 and pcDNA3.1-rGPR17. Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and LTD4 were used as the agonists to induce IL-8 production and the related changes in signal molecules. We found that LTC4 and LTD4 significantly induced IL-8 promoter activation in the HEK293 cells stably expressing hCysLT2, but not in those expressing hCysLT1 and rGPR17. In hCysLT2-HEK293 cells, LTC4 induced elevation of intracellular calcium, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Egr-1 expression, and stimulated IL-8 expression and release. These responses were blocked by the selective CysLT2 receptor antagonist HAMI3379. The ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited Egr-1 and IL-8 expression as well as IL-8 release, but the JNK and p38 inhibitors did not have the inhibitory effects. Down-regulation of Egr-1 by RNA interference with its siRNA inhibited the LTC4-induced IL-8 expression and release. In conclusion, these findings indicate the ERK-Egr-1 pathway of CysLT2 receptors mediates IL-8 production induced by the pro-inflammatory mediators LTC4 and LTD4.

Abstract: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD 1 — CD18 deficiency) is a rare disease characterized by disturbance of phagocyte function associated with less severe cellular and humoral dysfunction. The main features are bacterial and fungal infections predominantly in the skin and mucosal surfaces, impaired wound healing and delayed umbilical cord separation. The infections are indolent, necrotic and recurrent. In contrast to the striking difficulties in defense against bacterial and fungal microorganisms, LAD 1 patients do not exhibit susceptibility to viral infections and neoplasias. The severity of clinical manifestations is directly related to the degree of CD18 deficiency. Here, a 20year-old female presenting a partial CD18 deficiency that developed a megakaryocytic (M7) acute myeloid leukemia is described for the first time. The clinical features of the patient included relapsing oral thrush due to Candida, cutaneous infections and upper and lower respiratory tract infections, followed by a locally severe necrotic genital herpetic lesion. The patient's clinical features improved for a period of approximately two years, followed by severe bacterial infections. At that time, the investigation showed a megakaryocytic acute myeloid leukemia, treated with MEC without clinical improvement. The highly aggressive evolution of the leukemia in this patient suggests that adhesion molecules could be involved in the protection against the spread of neoplastic cells.

Abstract: In the present study, we investigated the effect of simultaneous downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B (pUC), alone or in combination with radiation, on JNK–MAPK signaling pathway in regulating the migration of non-GICs (glioma-initiating cells) and GICs. The increase in the expression of p-JNK with pUC treatment was mostly localized to nucleus whereas increase in the expression of p-JNK with radiation and overexpression of uPAR and cathepsin B was confined to cytoplasm of the cells. Depletion of cytosolic p-JNK with pUC treatment inhibited migration by downregulating the expression of the adapter proteins of the focal adhesion complex. We also observed that knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B regulated the Ras–Pak-1 pathway to induce the translocation of p-JNK from cytosol to nucleus. In control cells, Pak-1 served as a functional inhibitor for MEKK-1, which inhibits the complex formation of MEKK-1 and p-JNK and thus inhibits the translocation of this complex into nucleus. Hence, we conclude that glioma cells utilize the availability of cytosolic p-JNK in driving the cells towards migration. Finally, treating the cells with pUC alone or in combination with radiation induced the translocation of the MEKK-1-p-JNK complex from cytosol to nucleus, thereby inhibiting the migration of glioma cells.

Abstract: Summary
The plant immune signaling network needs to be robust against attack from fast-evolving pathogens and tunable to optimize immune responses. We investigated the basis of robustness and tunability in the signaling network controlling pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis. A dynamic network model containing four major signaling sectors, the jasmonate, ethylene, phytoalexin-deficient 4, and salicylate sectors, which together govern up to 80% of the PTI levels, was built using data for dynamic sector activities and PTI levels under exhaustive combinatorial sector perturbations. Our regularized multiple regression model had a high level of predictive power and captured known and unexpected signal flows in the network. The sole inhibitory sector in the model, the ethylene sector, contributed centrally to network robustness via its inhibition of the jasmonate sector. The model’s multiple input sites linked specific signal input patterns varying in strength and timing to different network response patterns, indicating a mechanism enabling tunability.

Abstract: Pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase type I (P5′NI) deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition that causes nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, characterized by marked basophilic stippling and pyrimidine nucleotide accumulation in erythrocytes. We herein present two African descendant patients, father and daughter, with P5′N deficiency, both born from first cousins. Investigation of the promoter polymorphism of the uridine diphospho glucuronosyl transferase 1A (UGT1A) gene revealed that the father was homozygous for the allele (TA7) and the daughter heterozygous (TA6/TA7). P5′NI gene (NT5C3) gene sequencing revealed a further change in homozygosity at amino acid position 56 (p.R56G), located in a highly conserved region. Both patients developed gallstones; however the father, who had undergone surgery for the removal of stones, had extremely severe intrahepatic cholestasis and, liver biopsy revealed fibrosis and siderosis grade III, leading us to believe that the homozygosity of the UGT1A polymorphism was responsible for the more severe clinical features in the father. Moreover, our results show how the clinical expression of hemolytic anemia is influenced by epistatic factors and we describe a new mutation in the P5′N gene associated with enzyme deficiency, iron overload, and severe gallstone formation. To our knowledge, this is the first description of P5′N deficiency in South Americans.

Abstract: Nanog regulates human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal activity. Activation of ERKs signaling negatively regulates ES cell self-renewal and induces differentiation, but the mechanisms are not understood. We found that ERK1 binds and phosphorylates Nanog. Activation of MEK/ERKs signaling and phosphorylation of Nanog inhibit Nanog transactivation, inducing ES cell differentiation. Conversely, suppression of MEK/ERKs signaling enhances Nanog transactivation to inhibit ES cell differentiation. We observed that phosphorylation of Nanog by ERK1 decreases Nanog stability through ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation. Further, we found that this phosphorylation induces binding of FBXW8 with Nanog to reduce Nanog protein stability. Overall, our results demonstrated that ERKs-mediated Nanog phosphorylation plays an important role in self-renewal of ES cells through FBXW8-mediated Nanog protein stability.

Abstract: The ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to self-renew and differentiate into progenitors is essential for homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. The longevity of HSCs makes them vulnerable to accumulating DNA damage, which may be leukemogenic or result in senescence and cell death. Additionally, the ability of HSCs to self-renew and differentiate allows DNA damage to spread throughout the hematologic system, leaving the organism vulnerable to disease. In this review we discuss cell fate decisions made in the face of DNA damage and other cellular stresses, and the role of reactive oxygen species in the long-term maintenance of HSCs and their DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease (CD), are genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However, patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples indicates that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and early diagnosis of CD.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have both garnered abundant interests from immunologists worldwide, as both MSCs and Tregs can be considered immunosuppressive in their own right. But a little attention has been paid to the impacts of MSCs on Tregs. To clarify the effects of MSCs on Tregs, we performed the coculture systems within MSCs and Tregs. We confirmed that MSC-exposed Tregs are capable of more immunosuppressive than Tregs without coculturing with MSCs. And this augmenting suppressive capacity was accompanied with an upregulation of programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD-1) on Tregs. Importantly, we found that cell viability of Tregs was excluded from the influences of MSCs. Finally, we showed that PD-1/B7-H1 interactions and IL-10 might be responsible for the enhanced suppressive capability of MSC-exposed Tregs. Further analysis revealed that PD-1/B7-H1 interactions were not responsible for the productions of IL-10 and TGF-β1 in the MSC-Treg coculture systems; in contrast, IL-10 rather than TGF-β1 played a role in the upregualtion of PD-1. Furthermore, this is the first explorative study to evaluate the immunomodulation of MSCs on the suppressive capacity of Tregs in MSC–Treg in vitro coculture setting.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer mainly due to spheroids organization of cancer cells that disseminate within the peritoneal cavity. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ovarian cancer spheroids resist anoikis, choosing as models the 2 well-characterized human ovarian cancer cell lines IGROV1 and SKOV3. These cell lines have the propensity to float as clusters, and were isolated from tumor tissue and ascites, respectively. To form spheroids, IGROV1 and SKOV3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells were maintained under anchorage-independent culture conditions, in which both lines survive at least a week. A short apoptotic period prior to a survival signaling commitment was observed for IGROV1 cells whereas SKOV3 cells entered G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. This difference in behavior was due to different signals. With regard to SKOV3 cells, activation of p38 and an increase in p130/Rb occurred once anchorage-independent culture was established. Analyses of the survival signaling pathway switched on by IGROV1 cells showed that activation of ERK1/2 was required to evade apoptosis, an effect partly dependent on PKC activation and αv integrins. αv-integrin expression is essential for survival through activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The above data indicate that ovarian cancer cells can resist anoikis in the spheroid state by arrest in the cell cycle or through activation of αv-integrin-ERK-mediated survival signals. Such signaling might result in the selection of resistant cells within disseminating spheroids, favoring further relapse in ovarian cancers.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with increase in oxidative stress and irreversible membrane changes that originates from the instability and polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S (HbS). The relationship between erythrocyte membrane changes as assessed by a decrease in deformability and oxidative stress as assessed by an increase in heme degradation was investigated. The erythrocyte deformability and heme degradation for 27 subjects with SCD and 7 with sickle trait were compared with normal healthy adults. Changes in both deformability and heme degradation increased in the order of control to trait to non-crisis SCD to crisis SCD resulting in a very significantly negative correlation between deformability and heme degradation. However, a quantitative analysis of the changes in deformability and heme degradation for these different groups of subjects indicated that sickle trait had a much smaller effect on deformability than on heme degradation, while crisis affects deformability to a greater extent than heme degradation. These findings provide insights into the relative contributions of erythrocyte oxidative stress and membrane damage during the progression of SCD providing a better understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) need to maintain their genomic integrity in response to DNA damage to safeguard the integrity of the organism. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal forms of DNA damage and, if not repaired correctly, they can lead to cell death, genomic instability and cancer. How human ESCs (hESCs) maintain genomic integrity in response to agents that cause DSBs is relatively unclear. In the present study we aim to determine the hESC response to the DSB inducing agent camptothecin (CPT). We find that hESCs are hypersensitive to CPT, as evidenced by high levels of apoptosis. CPT treatment leads to DNA-damage sensor kinase (ATM and DNA-PKcs) phosphorylation on serine 1981 and serine 2056, respectively. Activation of ATM and DNA-PKcs was followed by histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser 139, a sensitive reporter of DNA damage. Nuclear accumulation and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 were also observed. Remarkably, hESC viability was further decreased when ATM or DNA-PKcs kinase activity was impaired by the use of specific inhibitors. The hypersensitivity to CPT treatment was markedly reduced by blocking p53 translocation to mitochondria with pifithrin-μ. Importantly, programmed cell death was achieved in the absence of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21Waf1, a bona fide p53 target gene. Conversely, differentiated hESCs were no longer highly sensitive to CPT. This attenuated apoptotic response was accompanied by changes in cell cycle profile and by the presence of p21Waf1. The results presented here suggest that p53 has a key involvement in preventing the propagation of damaged hESCs when genome is threatened. As a whole, our findings support the concept that the phenomenon of apoptosis is a prominent player in normal embryonic development.

Abstract: Taliglucerase alfa is a β-glucosidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) approved in the US and other countries for the treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) in adults and is approved in pediatric and adult patients in Australia and Canada. It is the first approved plant cell-expressed recombinant human protein. A Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, 9-month study assessed safety and efficacy of switching to taliglucerase alfa in adult and pediatric patients with GD treated with imiglucerase for at least the previous 2years. Patients with stable disease were offered taliglucerase alfa treatment using the same dose (9–60U/kg body weight) and regimen of administration (every 2weeks) as imiglucerase. This report summarizes results from 26 adult and 5 pediatric patients who participated in the trial. Disease parameters (spleen and liver volumes, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and biomarker levels) remained stable through 9months of treatment in adults and children following the switch from imiglucerase. All treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. Exploratory parameters of linear growth and development showed positive outcomes in pediatric patients. These findings provide evidence of the efficacy and safety profile of taliglucerase alfa as an ERT for GD in patients previously treated with imiglucerase. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00712348.

Abstract: Imatinib mesylate (IM/Gleevec®), a selective inhibitor of chimeric Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase, was developed as a first line drug to treat CML and ALL Ph+ patients. Earlier studies have shown that hemin counteracts the IM-induced cell killing in human K-562 CML cells. In this study, we investigated whether IM disrupts the heme-dependent Cytochrome c Oxidase (COX) Biosynthesis and Assembly Pathway (HDCBAP) in Bcr–Abl+ and Bcr–Abl− cells by affecting the expression of key-genes. Cells were exposed to IM and evaluated at time intervals for cell growth, cell death, expression of various genes by RT-PCR analysis as well as Sco2 mature protein levels by western blot analysis and COX enzymatic activity. IM at 1μM induced extensive cell growth inhibition and cell death as well as marked suppression of the expression of SCO2 and FRATAXIN (FXN) genes in human K-562 and KU-812 Bcr–Abl+ CML cells. IM also reduced the protein level of mature Sco2 mitochondrial protein as well as COX activity in these cell lines. However, treatment of human MOLT-4 Bcr–Abl− cells with 1μM and even with higher concentrations (4×10−5M) of IM neither reduced the expression of SCO2 and FXN genes nor suppressed the protein level of mature Sco2 protein and COX activity. Our findings indicate that SCO2 and FXN genes, involved in HDCBAP, are repressed by IM in human Bcr–Abl+ CML cells and may represent novel target sites in leukemia therapy.

Abstract: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, are the current treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). BCR-ABL1 point mutations are the principal cause of resistance to treatment; however other mechanisms could be involved in failure to TKI therapy. LYN is a src kinase protein that regulates survival and responsiveness of tumor cells by a BCR-ABL1 independent mechanism. PTEN tumor suppressor gene is downregulated by BCR-ABL1 in CML stem cells and its deletion is associated with acceleration of disease. In this study we evaluated the expression of LYN, PTEN and the ratio of both genes in 40 healthy donors (HD) and in 139 CML patients; 88 of them resistant to TKI in different phases of disease and 51 in chronic phase classified as optimal responders (OR) to TKI [40 treated with imatinib or nilotinib (OR-IN) and 11 treated with dasatinib (OR-D) therapy]. When we analyzed the gene expression values of LYN, an increase was observed only in advanced stages of the disease, however, when we analyzed the ratio between LYN and PTEN genes, the group of resistant patients in chronic phase in imatinib or nilotinib treatment (CP-IN) also showed a significant increase. Resistant patients treated with dasatinib, a src kinase inhibitor, presented a similar ratio to the observed in HD. In addition, the LYN/PTEN ratio and the LYN expression showed a direct significant correlation with BCR-ABL1 transcript levels in unmutated resistant patients treated with non-src kinase inhibitors. We were able to identify 8/35 (23%) of cases in CP-IN and 4/12 (33%) in accelerated phase and blast phase (AP/BC-IN), in which resistance could be associated with an increase in the ratio of the LYN/PTEN. Our data suggest that the LYN/PTEN expression ratio may be a sensitive monitor of disease progression in unmutated CML patients under imatinib or nilotinib treatment. This ratio could detect cases when resistance is related to altered LYN expression, suggesting that the treatment change to a src kinase inhibitor would be most suitable to overcome resistance.

Abstract: Background
GRAF is a recognized tumor suppressor gene that was found inactivated in AML. However, the prognostic role of a GRAF transcript has not been studied in patients with AML.
Methods
In this study, we investigated the expression of the GRAF transcript by real time quantitative PCR in 60 AML patients and 30 healthy age and sex matched controls.
Results
GRAF expression was significantly lower in patients with AML when compared to controls (P=0.008). There were no significant differences in clinical features, FAB subtypes and cytogenetic risk subgroups between patients with high and low GRAF expression levels. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that patients with high GRAF expression had longer overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that, besides WBC count, GRAF expression was also an independent prognostic factor for AML.
Conclusion
We provide evidence that high GRAF expression is a favorable prognostic marker in patients with AML.

Abstract: Hepcidin transcription is strongly down-regulated under hypoxic conditions, however whether hypoxia inhibits hepcidin directly or indirectly is still unknown. We investigated the time course of hypoxia-mediated hepcidin down-regulation in vivo in healthy volunteers exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude and, based on the hypothesis that circulating factors are implicated in hepcidin inhibition, we analyzed the effect of sera of these volunteers exposed to normoxia and hypoxia on hepcidin expression in Huh-7 cell lines. Hypoxia led to a significant hepcidin down-regulation in vivo that was almost complete within 72h of exposure and followed erythropoietin induction. This delay in hepcidin down-regulation suggests the existence of soluble factor/s regulating hepcidin production. We then stimulated HuH-7 cells with normoxic and hypoxic sera to analyze the effects of sera on hepcidin regulation. Hypoxic sera had a significant inhibitory effect on hepcidin promoter activity assessed by a luciferase assay, although the amount of such decrease was not as relevant as that observed in vivo. Cellular mRNA analysis showed that a number of volunteers' sera inhibited hepcidin expression, concurrently with ID1 inhibition, suggesting that inhibitory factor(s) may act through the SMAD-pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Arthopods such as Ixodes scapularis ticks serve as vectors for many human pathogens. The arthropod gut presents a pivotal microbial entry point and determines pathogen colonization and survival. We show that the gut microbiota of I. scapularis, a major vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, influence spirochete colonization of ticks. Perturbing the gut microbiota of larval ticks reduced Borrelia colonization, and dysbiosed larvae displayed decreased expression of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Diminished STAT expression corresponded to lower expression of peritrophin, a key glycoprotein scaffold of the glycan-rich mucus-like peritrophic matrix (PM) that separates the gut lumen from the epithelium. The integrity of the I. scapularis PM was essential for B. burgdorferi to efficiently colonize the gut epithelium. These data elucidate a functional link between the gut microbiota, STAT-signaling, and pathogen colonization in the context of the gut epithelial barrier of an arthropod vector.

Abstract: Non-metastatic glycoprotein melanoma protein B (GPNMB), also known as osteoactivin (OA) is expressed in a wide array of tumors and represents an emerging target for drug development. In this study, we investigated the role of GPNMB/OA in the progression of human metastatic DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. GPNMB/OA contribution in PCa malignant phenotype has been analyzed by small interfering RNA-induced GPNMB/OA silencing. We found that following GPNMB/OA silencing the migration capability of both DU145 and PC3 cells, evaluated by using in vitro invasivity assay, as well as the metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity were equally strongly inhibited. By contrast knocking down GPNMB/OA weakly attenuated cell proliferation rate of DU145, an effect that paralleled with an increase number of apoptotic cells. However, PC3 cell growth seems to be not affected by GPNMB/OA. Together, these data reveal that GPNMB/OA acts as a critical molecular mediator promoting the acquisition of the more aggressive, pro-metastatic phenotype distinctive of human DU145 and PC3 cell lines.

Abstract: An increasing body of evidence suggests that dysregulation of iron metabolism contributes to age-related pathologies. We have previously observed increased hepatic iron with aging, and that environmental heat stress stimulates a further increase in iron and oxidative liver injury in old rats. The purpose of this study was to determine a mechanism for the increase in hepatic iron in old rats after heat stress. Young (6mo) and old (24mo) Fischer 344 rats were exposed to two heating bouts separated by 24h. Livers were harvested after the second heat stress, and protein levels of the iron import protein, transferrin receptor-1 (TFR1), and the iron export protein, ferroportin (Fpn) were determined by immunoblot. In the nonheated condition, old rats had lower TFR1 expression, and higher Fpn expression. After heat stress, TFR1 declined in the old rats, and iron chelation studies demonstrated that this decline was dependent on a hyperthermia-induced increase in iron. TFR1 did not change in the young rats after heat stress. Since TFR1 is inversely regulated by iron, our results suggest that the increase in intracellular iron with aging and heat stress lower TFR1 expression. Fpn expression increased in both age groups after heat stress, but this response was delayed in old rats. This delay in the induction of an iron exporter suggests a mechanism for the increase in hepatic iron and oxidative injury after heat stress in aged organisms.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are promising resources for clinical therapies due to their potential to generate multiple cell types. The dynamic expression of de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) is essential to ESCs; however, the regulatory mechanism of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b expression in ESCs is still poorly understood. Here, we reported that decreased expression of microRNA-495 (miR-495) in the first 2days of embryoid body (EB) formation was required for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation because repressed mesoderm and endoderm lineages were detected in ectopic miR-495 expression mESCs. This effect was reversed by the function blockade of miR-495. We identified Dnmt3a as a functional target of miR-495 and showed that endogenous miR-495 repressed the expression of Dnmt3a in mESCs. Furthermore, the effect of miR-495 on mESCs could be eliminated by Dnmt3a overexpression. Moreover, miR-495 had no effect on the expression of Dnmt3b despite the findings obtained from previous studies that mainly focused on the common characteristics of the regulatory mechanisms of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression. Thus, our studies not only uncovered a previously uncharacterized function of miR-495 in mESC differentiation but also generated a new idea to explore the mechanisms governing the functional difference between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.

Abstract: Background
High expression of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) contributes to pathological iron overload in thalassemia. Sickle cell syndromes are characterized by increased levels of erythropoiesis, although the primary defect involves the destruction of mature erythrocytes.
Aim
To determine serum GDF-15 in 35 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared to 35 healthy controls and assess its relation to markers of hemolysis, iron overload and vascular complications.
Methods
GDF-15 was measured and correlated to genotype, frequency of sickling crises, hydroxyurea therapy and serum ferritin.
Results
GDF-15 levels were increased in SCD patients whether sickle cell anemia or sickle β° thalassemia compared with controls (p<0.001) with no significant difference between patients' groups. GDF-15 was significantly higher in patients who had serum ferritin ≥2500μg/L, previous cerebral stroke, and splenectomy. GDF-15 was not significantly related to frequency of sickling crises, pulmonary hypertension, or hydroxyurea therapy. On regression analysis, transfusion index, lactate dehydrogenase and serum ferritin were independently related to GDF-15.
Conclusion
Increased GDF-15 in SCD reflects the importance of ineffective erythropoiesis in the pathophysiology and severity of anemia in SCD. GDF-15 levels are related to hemolysis and iron overload and may provide utility for identifying patients at increased risk of thrombotic events.

Abstract: Chromosome translocations are often observed in cancer cells, being in some cases the cause of neoplastic transformation while in others the results of it. In previous works, we reproduced this major genomic rearrangement by bridge-induced chromosome translocation (BIT) technology in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and reported that it affects DNA replication, cell cycle, karyogamy, and cytokinesis while it produces genetic instability. In the present work, we further discovered that this event can lead to increased resistance to anticancer chemicals like Doxorubicin and Latrunculin A via an endocytic actin network deregulation triggered by over-expression of the PRK1 serine/threonine protein kinase gene. This effect is further enhanced by the overexpression of PDR1 and PDR3 transcriptional regulators of pleiotropic drug resistance factors. However, when the actin depolymerizing drug Latrunculin A is forcefully allowed to penetrate through their altered cell wall and membrane barriers, it can kill translocants more efficiently than wild type cells. These observations provide an example of an acquired anticancer drug resistance mechanism and could serve as a lead to how it might be overcome, as any treatment inhibiting genome rearrangements could increase the positive outcome of anticancer therapy by lowering cellular drug resistance.

Astragaloside IV attenuates glycated albumin-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting oxidative stress in renal proximal tubular cells,

Abstract: In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a classic pathological process in tubular damage. Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in DKD. Astragaloside IV (A-IV), one of the main active ingredients of Astragalus membranaceus, exhibits a wide range of biological activities. However, the effect of A-IV on regulating EMT in tubular cells is unclear. This study aims to determine whether A-IV could attenuate glycated albumin (GA)-induced EMT in the NRK-52E cell line by inhibiting oxidative stress. GA and A-IV-induced cytotoxicity were assayed by CCK-8. The intercellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was detected by H2DCFDA. The activity of NADPH oxidase was assayed by adding exogenous NADPH oxidase, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) units were observed by NBT. We used a microscope to examine the morphology of the NRK-52E cell line. We conducted a wound healing assay to measure cell mobility. To determine mRNA and protein expressions of α-SMA and E-cadherin, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis. A-IV significantly attenuated GA-induced amplification of ROS, lowered the increased level of NADPH oxidase activity, and elevated the decreased level of SOD units. The GA-induced NRK-52E cell line showed increased expression of α-SMA and decreased expression of E-cadherin in mRNA and protein levels, whereas A-IV alleviated the expression of α-SMA and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Our data demonstrate that GA could induce NRK-52E cell line EMT through oxidative stress. This effect could be attenuated by A-IV via regulation of the impaired redox balance.
