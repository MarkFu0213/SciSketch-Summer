Abstract: Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath formed by the spiral wrapping of specialized glial cells around axon segments. Myelinating glia allow for rapid transmission of nerve impulses and metabolic support of axons, and the absence of or disruption to myelin results in debilitating motor, cognitive, and emotional deficits in humans. Because myelin is a jawed vertebrate innovation, zebrafish are one of the simplest vertebrate model systems to study the genetics and development of myelinating glia. The morphogenetic cellular movements and genetic program that drive myelination are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, and myelin develops rapidly in zebrafish larvae, within 3–5days postfertilization. Myelin ultrastructure can be visualized in the zebrafish from larval to adult stages via transmission electron microscopy, and the dynamic development of myelinating glial cells may be observed in vivo via transgenic reporter lines in zebrafish larvae. Zebrafish are amenable to genetic and pharmacological screens, and screens for myelinating glial phenotypes have revealed both genes and drugs that promote myelin development, many of which are conserved in mammalian glia. Recently, zebrafish have been employed as a model to understand the complex dynamics of myelinating glia during development and regeneration. In this chapter, we describe these key methodologies and recent insights into mechanisms that regulate myelination using the zebrafish model.

Abstract: Low and high serum retinol levels are associated with increased fracture risk and poor bone health. We recently showed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are negative regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Here we show RARs are also negative regulators of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. The pan-RAR agonist, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), directly inhibited differentiation and mineralisation of early osteoprogenitors and impaired the differentiation of more mature osteoblast populations. In contrast, the pan-RAR antagonist, IRX4310, accelerated differentiation of early osteoprogenitors. These effects predominantly occurred via RARγ and were further enhanced by an RARα agonist or antagonist, respectively. RAR agonists similarly impaired adipogenesis in osteogenic cultures. RAR agonist treatment resulted in significant upregulation of the Wnt antagonist, Sfrp4. This accompanied reduced nuclear and cytosolic β-catenin protein and reduced expression of the Wnt target gene Axin2, suggesting impaired Wnt/β-catenin signalling. To determine the effect of RAR inhibition in post-natal mice, IRX4310 was administered to male mice for 10 days and bones were assessed by µCT. No change to trabecular bone volume was observed, however, radial bone growth was impaired. These studies show RARs directly influence osteoblast and adipocyte formation from mesenchymal cells, and inhibition of RAR signalling in vivo impairs radial bone growth in post-natal mice.

Abstract: Summary
SU6656, a Src kinase inhibitor, was reported to increase fat oxidation and reduce body weight in mice, with proposed mechanisms involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation via inhibition of phosphorylation of either LKB1 or AMPK by the Src kinase, Fyn. However, we report that AMPK activation by SU6656 is independent of Src kinases or tyrosine phosphorylation of LKB1 or AMPK and is not due to decreased cellular energy status or binding at the ADaM site on AMPK. SU6656 is a potent AMPK inhibitor, yet binding at the catalytic site paradoxically promotes phosphorylation of Thr172 by LKB1. This would enhance phosphorylation of downstream targets provided the lifetime of Thr172 phosphorylation was sufficient to allow dissociation of the inhibitor and subsequent catalysis prior to its dephosphorylation. By contrast, sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor in clinical use, activates AMPK indirectly by inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism and increasing cellular AMP:ADP and/or ADP:ATP ratios.

Abstract: Impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle serves a critical role in the development of insulin resistance (IR), whereas the precise mechanism of the process remains unknown. Recently, the evolutionarily conserved, stress-inducible protein Sestrin2 (Sesn2) has been proposed to play a protective role against obesity-induced IR and diabetes. Activation of Sesn2 may activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) accompanied by suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which may ultimately lead to autophagy induction. In view of the potential protective effects of autophagy on the physiological and the pathological regulatory processes via the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolism, we investigated the effects of Sesn2 on the components of the insulin signaling pathway and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in palmitate-induced insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes. We showed that Sesn2 effectively restored the impaired insulin signaling. Moreover, autophagic activity decreased in response to palmitate, whereas Sesn2 significantly reversed the palmitate-suppressed autophagic signaling in this context. Our findings further revealed that Sesn2-induced autophagy contributed to restore the impaired insulin signaling through the activation of AMPK signal. Even in the presence of palmitate, Sesn2 up-regulation maintained insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism via AMPK-dependent autophagic activation.

Abstract: To precisely characterize CD146 in adipose stromal/progenitor cells (ASCs) we sorted the stromal vascular faction (SVF) of human abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) according to cell surface (cs) expression of CD146, DLK1 and CD34. This test identified three main SVF cell populations: ~50% cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+/cs-CD146− ASCs, ~7.5% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34dim/+/cs-CD146+ and ~7.5% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34dim/+/cs-CD146− cells. All cells contained intracellular CD146. Whole mount fluorescent IHC staining of small vessels detected CD146+ endothelial cells (CD31+/CD34+/CD146+) and pericytes (CD31−/CD34−/CD146+ ASCs). The cells in the outer adventitial layer showed the typical ASC morphology, were strongly CD34+ and contained low amounts of intracellular CD146 protein (CD31−/CD34+/CD146+). Additionally, we detected wavy CD34−/CD146+ and CD34dim/CD146+ cells. CD34dim/CD146+ cells were slightly more bulky than CD34−/CD146+ cells. Both CD34−/CD146+ and CD34dim/CD146+ cells were detached from the inner pericyte layer and protruded into the outer adventitial layer. Cultured early passage ASCs contained low levels of CD146 mRNA, which was expressed in two different splicing variants, at a relatively high amount of the CD146-long form and at a relatively low amount of the CD146-short form. ASCs contained low levels of CD146 protein, which consisted predominantly long form and a small amount of short form. The CD146 protein was highly stable, and the majority of the protein was localized in the Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the spatial localization of CD34+/CD146+ and CD34−/CD146+ cells in the adipose niche of sWAT and identifies CD146 as intracellular protein in cs-DLK1−/cs-CD34+/cs-CD146− ASCs.

Abstract: Summary
Numerically the most important risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the presence of mutations in the glucocerebrosidase GBA1 gene. In vitro and in vivo studies show that GBA1 mutations reduce glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and are associated with increased α-synuclein levels, reflecting similar changes seen in idiopathic PD brain. We have developed a neural crest stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuronal model that recapitulates biochemical abnormalities in GBA1 mutation-associated PD. Cells showed reduced GCase protein and activity, impaired macroautophagy, and increased α-synuclein levels. Advantages of this approach include easy access to stem cells, no requirement to reprogram, and retention of the intact host genome. Treatment with a GCase chaperone increased GCase protein levels and activity, rescued the autophagic defects, and decreased α-synuclein levels. These results provide the basis for further investigation of GCase chaperones or similar drugs to slow the progression of PD.

Abstract: Controlling relative daughter cell size is key during cytokinesis. Uncontrolled size asymmetries can lead to aneuploidy and division failure. At the same time, precisely regulated size asymmetries are of crucial importance in many divisions during embryonic development. Therefore, being able to monitor daughter cell size is important in cytokinesis studies. However, freely available tools allowing to effectively measure the size of daughter cells in three dimensions during cytokinesis are missing. Here, we describe an open-access plugin for ImageJ or Fiji based on an active contour surface representation of the cells. Our method provides a user-friendly and accurate way to monitor the size of the two daughter cells throughout cytokinesis.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as novel regulators in various pathological processes including ischemic stroke. However, the precise role of miRNAs in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-137 in the regulation of neuronal ischemia/reperfusion injury with oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), a model of global brain ischemia. The results showed that miR-137 was significantly downregulated in neurons subjected to OGD/R treatment: OGD/R-induced cell injury was markedly inhibited by miR-137 overexpression and exacerbated by miR-137 suppression. Moreover, Notch1 was predicted as a target gene of miR-137 and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis. Through targeting of Notch1, miR-137 regulated the Notch signaling pathway. The blockade of the Notch signaling pathway reversed the effect of miR-137 suppression, whereas overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain abrogated the effect of miR-137 overexpression on OGD/R-induced cell injury. Overall, our study suggests that miR-137 regulated the Notch signaling pathway by targeting Notch1 to protect neurons from OGD/R-induced cell injury, providing a novel insight into understanding the molecular basis of ischemia stroke and a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in HTT. Here we report correction of HD human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a CRISPR-Cas9 and piggyBac transposon-based approach. We show that both HD and corrected isogenic hiPSCs can be differentiated into excitable, synaptically active forebrain neurons. We further demonstrate that phenotypic abnormalities in HD hiPSC-derived neural cells, including impaired neural rosette formation, increased susceptibility to growth factor withdrawal, and deficits in mitochondrial respiration, are rescued in isogenic controls. Importantly, using genome-wide expression analysis, we show that a number of apparent gene expression differences detected between HD and non-related healthy control lines are absent between HD and corrected lines, suggesting that these differences are likely related to genetic background rather than HD-specific effects. Our study demonstrates correction of HD hiPSCs and associated phenotypic abnormalities, and the importance of isogenic controls for disease modeling using hiPSCs.

Abstract: Provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (Pim-1) has proved to be an oncogene and it is known that to depress Pim-1 activity may be a novel oncological treatment strategy. SGI-1776, a small molecule, is the first clinically tested inhibitor of the Pim kinase family. Here, we aimed to explore the effect of SGI-1776 on salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Expression of Pim-1 was confirmed in SACC and control tissues by qRT-PCR. After SGI-1776 treatment, the Pim-1 expressions and Pim-1 kinase activity in both SACC-83 and SACC-LM cell lines were measured. Cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed. Also, the expression of FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a, RUNX3, Bcl-2, BAD, p-BAD, Bim and p-Bim were detected by Western blot. The results showed that Pim-1 was significantly overexpressed in SACC tissues. SGI-1776 down-regulated the Pim-1 expression, inhibited Pim-1 kinase activity, reduced cell proliferation, decreased invasive ability, increased caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial depolarization. Reduced expression was also seen in p-FOXO3a, RUNX3, Bcl-2, p-BAD and p-Bim, whereas no significant changes were observed from FOXO3a, BAD and Bim. These results confirm the pivotal role of Pim-1 in SACC and suggest that targeting Pim-1 kinase signal pathway by SGI-1776 might be a promising therapeutic modality for SACC.

Abstract: RhoD belongs to the Rho GTPases, a protein family responsible for the regulation and organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and, consequently, many cellular processes like cell migration, cell division and vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton is dynamically regulated by increased or decreased protein levels of RhoD. Ectopic expression of RhoD has previously been shown to give an intertwined weave of actin filaments. We show that this RhoD-dependent effect is detected in several cell types and results in a less dynamic actin filament system. In contrast, RhoD depletion leads to increased actin filament-containing structures, such as cortical actin, stress fibers and edge ruffles. Moreover, vital cellular functions such as cell migration and proliferation are defective when RhoD is silenced. Taken together, we present data suggesting that RhoD is an important component in the control of actin dynamics and directed cell migration.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are present in all kingdoms of life and play fundamental roles in cell biology. sHSPs are key components of the cellular protein quality control system, acting as the first line of defense against conditions that affect protein homeostasis and proteome stability, from bacteria to plants to humans. sHSPs have the ability to bind to a large subset of substrates and to maintain them in a state competent for refolding or clearance with the assistance of the HSP70 machinery. sHSPs participate in a number of biological processes, from the cell cycle, to cell differentiation, from adaptation to stressful conditions, to apoptosis, and, even, to the transformation of a cell into a malignant state. As a consequence, sHSP malfunction has been implicated in abnormal placental development and preterm deliveries, in the prognosis of several types of cancer, and in the development of neurological diseases. Moreover, mutations in the genes encoding several mammalian sHSPs result in neurological, muscular, or cardiac age-related diseases in humans. Loss of protein homeostasis due to protein aggregation is typical of many age-related neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In light of the role of sHSPs in the clearance of un/misfolded aggregation-prone substrates, pharmacological modulation of sHSP expression or function and rescue of defective sHSPs represent possible routes to alleviate or cure protein conformation diseases. Here, we report the latest news and views on sHSPs discussed by many of the world’s experts in the sHSP field during a dedicated workshop organized in Italy (Bertinoro, CEUB, October 12–15, 2016).

Abstract: Cytokinesis is an essential step of cell proliferation leading to the physical separation of the dividing cells. Cytokinesis relies on both large scale and local scale cell shape changes, and terminates with the final abscission cut that requires close apposition of the plasma membrane. While furrow ingression is a prominent feature of the early phase of cytokinesis and is easy to visualize in all models, from dividing eggs to culture cells, the later steps of cytokinesis until abscission can be much more difficult to visualize. One key issue is to combine live-cell imaging over several hours and detailed, structural analysis of the cell shape changes in 3D, in particular at the time of cytokinetic abscission. Here, we describe the methodologies that we recently developed for studying cytokinetic abscission in human culture cells using live-cell phase-contrast microscopy, combined with correlative scanning electron microscopy. This allows us to determine the membrane surface and underlying cytoskeleton of the intercellular bridge with unprecedented precision and to determine the fate of the midbody remnant after abscission.

Abstract: Hypoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) is often incompletely repaired and leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. The Slit2 family of secreted glycoproteins is expressed in the kidney, it has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory activity and prevent ischemic renal injury in vivo. However, whether Slit2 reduces renal fibrosis and inflammation after hypoxic and inflammatory epithelial cells injury in vitro remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether Slit2 ameliorated fibrosis and inflammation in two renal epithelial cells line challenged with hypoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Renal epithelial cells were treated with hypoxia and LPS to induce cell injury. Hoechst staining and Western blot analysis was conducted to examine epithelial cells injury. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tested the inflammatory factor interleukin (IL)−1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and Western blot analysis determined the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)−1α, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Results revealed that hypoxia induced epithelial cells apoptosis, inflammatory factor IL-1β and TNF-α release and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. LPS could exacerbate hypoxia -induced epithelial cells apoptosis, IL-1β and TNF-α release and fibrosis. Slit2 reduced the expression of fibronectin, the rate of epithelial cell apoptosis, and the expression of inflammatory factor. Slit2 could also inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-κB, but not the expression of HIF-1α. Therefore, Slit2 attenuated inflammation and fibrosis after LPS- and hypoxia-induced epithelial cells injury via the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, but not depending on the HIF-1α signaling pathway.

Abstract: Cytokinesis requires the interplay between the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. Emerging evidence indicates that some cytokinetic components are essential for the postcytokinetic events such as epithelium organization and neural development. We have recently developed live cell imaging and conditional knockout techniques to visualize cytokinetic proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans Q neuroblasts and separate their postcytokinetic functions from cytokinetic ones. Here we describe how the fluorescent reporter strains and conditional knockout C. elegans are generated and how live cell imaging of Q neuroblast development are performed in our laboratory. Using these protocols, we uncovered a novel role of Anillin in stabilizing the actin network during neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth, and the postcytokinetic fate of midbody, which is released into the extracellular space and degraded by the adjacent macrophage using an apoptotic mimicry. These protocols could also be applicable to study other cellular processes in C. elegans or adapted to other model organisms, to provide better insights into their developmental basis.

Abstract: Molecular imaging of the assembly of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) complexes in living cells may lead to a deeper understanding of cellular oxygen sensing. Sophisticated live cell imaging has extended the toolbox to study the molecular response to changes in oxygen supply. In this respect fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as a technique to investigate protein-protein interaction in the nanoscale range gets increasing interest. Herein, we review FRET studies related to hypoxia research, emphasizing on recent progress, but also demonstrating how FRET studies are complementary or potentially superior to conventional biochemical as well as histochemical techniques. Technical advances in the application of FRET in living cells will overcome restrictions to end-point analysis on the population rather than single cell level and will thereby provide progress in understanding the cellular hypoxic response by HIF.

Abstract: Centralspindlin is a crucial regulator of animal cytokinesis, consisting of MKLP1 kinesin-6 and CYK4 Rho-family GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP). As a microtubule-bundling protein, it plays a crucial role in the formation of the central spindle. Through distinct accumulation to the antiparallel microtubule overlaps at the central spindle and the midbody, it recruits various downstream factors to the site of cell division as well as anchors the plasma membrane to maintain the narrow intercellular channels between the daughter cells until their final separation (abscission). A unique and functionally important feature of centralspindlin as a kinesin-containing protein complex is that the nonmotor component, CYK4, is not a passive cargo of the MKLP1 motor, but an integrated component of a microtubule-organizing machinery. Thus, for in vitro structural and functional assays, it is pivotal to prepare active stoichiometric complexes of the two components. Discussed here are two complimentary approaches, (1) reconstitution of the complex in bacterial extracts (in extract reconstitution) and (2) purification of a native complex from a mammalian cell line using a localization and affinity purification (LAP) tag.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is accompanied by morphological, functional, and metabolic alterations before acquisition of full pluripotency. Although the genome-wide effects of the reprogramming factors on gene expression are well documented, precise mechanisms by which gene expression changes evoke phenotypic responses remain to be determined. We used a Sendai virus-based system that permits reprogramming to progress in a strictly KLF4-dependent manner to screen for KLF4 target genes that are critical for the progression of reprogramming. The screening identified Tcl1 as a critical target gene that directs the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. KLF4-induced TCL1 employs a two-pronged mechanism, whereby TCL1 activates AKT to enhance glycolysis and counteracts PnPase to diminish oxidative phosphorylation. These regulatory mechanisms described here highlight a central role for a reprogramming factor in orchestrating the metabolic shift toward the acquisition of pluripotency during iPSC generation.

Abstract: Erlotinib (TarcevaR) is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Salinomycin, a polyether antibiotic, has been promising a novel therapeutic agent for lung cancer, and down-regulated the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) in NSCLC cell lines. Previous study showed that against EGFR and TS was strongly synergistic cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells. In this study, we showed that erlotinib (1.25–10μM) treatment down-regulating of TS expression in an AKT inactivation manner in two NSCLC cell lines, human lung squamous cell carcinoma H1703 and adenocarcinoma H1975 cells. Knockdown of TS using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibiting AKT activity with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 enhanced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of erlotinib. A combination of erlotinib and salinomycin resulted in synergistic enhancement of cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition in NSCLC cells, accompanied with reduced protein levels of phospho-AKT(Ser473), phospho-AKT(Thr308), and TS. Overexpression of a constitutive active AKT (AKT-CA) or Flag-TS expression vector reversed the salinomycin and erlotinib-induced synergistic cytotoxicity. Our findings suggested that the down-regulation of AKT-mediated TS expression by salinomycin enhanced the erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells. These results may provide a rationale to combine salinomycin with erlotinib for lung cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The establishment of DNA methylation patterns in oocytes is a highly dynamic process marking gene-regulatory events during fertilization, embryonic development, and adulthood. However, after epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells, how and when DNA methylation is re-established in developing human oocytes remains to be characterized. Here, using single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we describe DNA methylation patterns in three different maturation stages of human oocytes. We found that while broad-scale patterns of CpG methylation have been largely established by the immature germinal vesicle stage, localized changes continue into later development. Non-CpG methylation, on the other hand, undergoes a large-scale, generalized remodeling through the final stage of maturation, with the net overall result being the accumulation of methylation as oocytes mature. The role of the genome-wide, non-CpG methylation remodeling in the final stage of oocyte maturation deserves further investigation.

Abstract: Fibulin-5, a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein, is up-regulated in response to mechanical injury and can promote dermal wound healing. This study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of Fibulin-5 in the pathogenesis of post-burn inflammation in thermally-injured mice. Here, we found that Fibulin-5 was up-regulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of burn-injured mice. After nociceptive behavioral testing, DRG was isolated and cultured to detect the mechanism of Fibulin-5 in thermal injury models by recombinant adenovirus overexpressing Fibulin-5, RT-qPCR, Western Blot, ELISA, AP20187 (an activator of one kind of kinase phosphorylating the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, eIF2α), capsaicin (an agonist of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1), and an anti-CGRP neutralizing antibody. Also, the pathological state of skin tissues and the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and myeloperoxidase were examined by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We found that overexpression of Fibulin-5 attenuated the pain, inhibited the inflammatory response, and improved the pathologic condition induced by burn injury. Fibulin-5 overexpression significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation level of eIF2α and subsequently inhibited the TRPV1 channel and CREB/CGRP signaling. Additionally, anti-CGRP neutralizing antibody dramatically suppressed the inflammatory response induced by burn injury. The results suggest that overexpression of Fibulin-5 attenuates thermal inflammation via suppressing TRPV1/CGRP pathway. This may provide a potential therapy target to alleviate excessive inflammation in burn patients.

Abstract: Summary
The success of stem cell-mediated gene therapy in cancer treatment largely depends on the specific homing ability of stem cells. We have previously demonstrated that after in vitro induction of neuronal differentiation and dedifferentiation, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) revert to a primitive stem cell population (De-neu-BMSCs) distinct from naive BMSCs. We report here that De-neu-BMSCs express significantly higher levels of chemokines, and display enhanced homing abilities to glioma, the effect of which is mediated by the activated CCL5/CCR1/ERK axis. Intriguingly, we find that the activated chemokine axis in De-neu-BMSCs is epigenetically regulated by histone modifications. On the therapeutic front, we show that De-neu-BMSCs elicit stronger homing and glioma-killing effects together with cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine compared with unmanipulated BMSCs in vivo. Altogether, the current study provides an insight into chemokine regulation in BMSCs, which may have more profound effects on BMSC function and their application in regenerative medicine and cancer targeting.

Abstract: Background and aim
Acute liver failure (ALF) is an uncommon but serious disease still carrying a high mortality. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of AMPK on D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF.
Methods
In this study, we utilized intraperitoneal injection of D-GalN/LPS to induce ALF model, and analyzed the expression of AMPK, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6), Foxo3A and autophagy-related genes (Atg-5, Beclin-1, Atg-7) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in liver tissue. We also examined the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum of ALF mice. AMPK activation and inhibition of autophagy were induced by AICAR and 3-MA, respectively. Silence and overexpression of Foxo3A were performed by si-Foxo3A and pcDNA-Foxo3A, respectively. Lastly, the BMDM-conditioned medium (BMDM-CM) derived from BMDMs treated with AICAR and LPS were used to explore the effect of AMPK and Foxo3A on hepatocytes.
Result
The expression of AMPK was decreased in liver tissue and the level of ALT and AST were increased in serum of D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF mice. AMPK activation ameliorated ALF by inhibiting inflammation (downregulated TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression), activating autophagy (increased Atg-5, Beclin-1 and Atg-7 expression) and upregulating Foxo3A expression. Silence of Foxo3A decreased AMPK-activated autophagy, but overexpressing Foxo3A attenuated liver failure by activating autophagy. In addition, AMPK activation alleviated liver failure in vitro.
Conclusion
Thus, AMPK/Foxo3A/autophagy pathway may be an effective treatment approach to ameliorate ALF.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy, most of which remain unresponsive to chemotherapy. As one of the earliest cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate (MTX) serves as an anti-metabolite and anti-folate chemotherapy for various cancers. Unfortunately, MTX resistance prevents its clinical application in cancer therapy. Thereby, overcoming the drug resistance is an alternative strategy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of MTX in clinics. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained widespread attention in recent years. More and more emerging evidences have demonstrated that they play important regulatory roles in various biological activities and disease progression including drug resistance. In the present study, a MTX-resistant colorectal cell line HT-29 (HT-29-R) was developed, which displayed the active proliferation and shortened cell cycle. LncRNA H19 was found to be significantly upregulated in this resistant cell line. Further investigation showed that H19 knockdown sensitized the MTX resistance in HT-29-R cells while its overexpression improved the MTX resistance in the parental cells, suggesting that H19 mediate MTX resistance. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated in HT-29-R cells, and H19 knockdown suppressed this signaling in the parental cells. In conclusion, H19 mediated MTX resistance via activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which help to develop H19 as a promising therapeutic target for MTX resistant CRC.

Abstract: Cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a cardiac structural and regulatory protein; mutations of cMyBP-C are frequently associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Cardiac special transcription factors may regulate the expression of cMyBP-C. However, the role of cMyBP-C in congenital heart diseases (CHD) remains poorly understood. In the current study, western blotting and the MRM approach showed that cMyBP-C expression was significantly reduced in fetuses with CHD compared to those without. Furthermore, we found that cMyBP-C interacted with KLHL3 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence, and the degradation of cMyBP-C was caused by KLHL3-mediated ubiquitination. In addition, homocysteine (Hcy, a risk factor of CHD) treatment caused a decrease in cMyBP-C and an increase in KLHL3 expression, and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the Hcy-induced reduction of cMyBP-C expression. Finally, we verified that reduced cMyBP-C by Hcy promoted apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that Hcy decreases the expression of cMyBP-C through a KLHL3-mediated ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and thereby influences heart development.

Abstract: We investigated the role of autophagy, a process of controlled self-digestion, in the in vitro anticancer action of the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor ribavirin. Ribavirin-triggered oxidative stress, caspase activation, and apoptotic death in U251 human glioma cells were associated with the induction of autophagy, as confirmed by intracellular acidification, appearance of autophagic vesicles, conversion of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II, and degradation of autophagic target p62/sequestosome 1. Ribavirin downregulated the activity of autophagy-inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), as indicated by a decrease in phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate ribosomal p70S6 kinase and reduction of the mTORC1-activating Src/Akt signaling. Guanosine supplementation inhibited, while IMPDH inhibitor tiazofurin mimicked ribavirin-mediated autophagy induction, suggesting the involvement of IMPDH blockade in the observed effect. Autophagy suppression by ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of LC3 sensitized glioma cells to ribavirin-induced apoptosis. Ribavirin also induced cytoprotective autophagy associated with Akt/mTORC1 inhibition in C6 rat glioma cells. Our data demonstrate that ribavirin-triggered Akt/mTORC1-dependent autophagy counteracts apoptotic death of glioma cells, indicating autophagy suppression as a plausible therapeutic strategy for sensitization of cancer cells to IMPDH inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) causes elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood and carries an increased risk of early-onset cardiovascular disease. A caveat for exploration of new therapies for FH is the lack of adequate experimental models. We have created a comprehensive FH stem cell model with differentiated hepatocytes (iHeps) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including genetically engineered iPSCs, for testing therapies for FH. We used FH iHeps to assess the effect of simvastatin and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies on LDL-C uptake and cholesterol lowering in vitro. In addition, we engrafted FH iHeps into the liver of Ldlr−/−/Rag2−/−/Il2rg−/− mice, and assessed the effect of these same medications on LDL-C clearance and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in vivo. Our iHep models recapitulate clinical observations of higher potency of PCSK9 antibodies compared with statins for reversing the consequences of FH, demonstrating the utility for preclinical testing of new therapies for FH patients.

Abstract: A sufficient supply molecular oxygen is essential for the maintenance of physiologic metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis for most metazoans. For this reason, mechanisms have evolved for eukaryotic cells to adapt to conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia). These mechanisms rely on the modification of pre-existing proteins, translational arrest and transcriptional changes. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF; a master regulator of gene induction in response to hypoxia) is responsible for the majority of induced gene expression in hypoxia. However, much less is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for gene repression, an essential part of the adaptive transcriptional response. Hypoxia-induced gene repression leads to a reduction in energy demanding processes and the redirection of limited energetic resources to essential housekeeping functions. Recent developments have underscored the importance of transcriptional repressors in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To date, at least ten distinct transcriptional repressors have been reported to demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia. Central among these is the Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which regulates over 200 genes. In this review, written to honor the memory and outstanding scientific legacy of Lorenz Poellinger, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge with respect to transcriptional repressors and their target genes in hypoxia.

Abstract: RIC8A functions as a chaperone and guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a subset of G protein α subunits. Multiple G protein subunits mediate various signalling events that regulate cell adhesion and migration and the involvement of RIC8A in some of these processes has been demonstrated. We have previously shown that the deficiency of RIC8A causes a failure in mouse gastrulation and neurogenesis – major events in embryogenesis that rely on proper association of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and involve active cell migration. To elaborate on these findings, we used Ric8a-/- mouse embryonic stem cells and Ric8a-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and found that RIC8A plays an important role in the organisation and remodelling of actin cytoskeleton and cell-ECM association. Ric8a-deficient cells were able to attach to different ECM components, but were unable to spread correctly, and did not form stress fibres or focal adhesion complexes. We also found that the presence of RIC8A is necessary for the activation of β1 integrins and integrin-mediated cell migration.

Abstract: Cytokinesis, a model cell shape change event, is controlled by an integrated system that coordinates the mitotic spindle signals with a mechanoresponsive cytoskeletal network that drives contractility and furrow ingression. Quantitative methods that measure cell mechanics, mechanoresponse (mechanical stress-induced protein accumulation), protein dynamics, and molecular interactions are necessary to provide insight into both the mechanical and biochemical components involved in cytokinesis and cell shape regulation. Micropipette aspiration, fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching are valuable methods for measuring cell mechanics and protein dynamics in vivo that occur on nanometer to micron length-scales, and microsecond to minute timescales. Collectively, these methods provide the ability to quantify the molecular interactions that control the cell's ability to change shape and undergo cytokinesis.

Abstract: Animal cell cytokinesis proceeds through three successive stages: a contractile ring stage, an intercellular bridge stage, and an abscission stage. Many studies have identified a complex network of key proteins required for successful cytokinesis. While each component interacts with, and depends on, several other components, our understanding of how these proteins cooperate in space and time to ensure faithful progression through the stages of cytokinesis remains incomplete. A full understanding of the complexity of the process and its underlying machinery necessitates experimental systems that allow both genetic manipulation and real-time visualization of the various components throughout the successive stages of cytokinesis. Cultured Drosophila S2 cells provide such a system. They are genetically tractable thanks to their exquisite sensitivity to RNA interference mediated by double-stranded RNAs, which can be generated with ease in the laboratory. Furthermore, S2 cells grow well under normal atmospheric conditions, and stable lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins can be readily generated, making them ideal for long-term live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Here we describe methodology for exploiting S2 cells for the study of cytokinesis, with an emphasis on live-cell imaging. We describe a variety of fluorescent markers available and their utility for highlighting different structures at different stages of cytokinesis. We describe our experimental setup that forms the basis for live-cell analysis of loss-of-function RNAi experiments, rescue experiments, and structure-function analyses of key regulators of cytokinesis. Finally, we describe the types of phenotypes that one can observe at the different stages of Drosophila S2 cell cytokinesis.

Abstract: Although Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) has been intensively studied, the functions of E-domain peptides of pro-IGF-I, however, have been overlooked. In our laboratory, several anti-cancer activities of the E-peptide of pro-IGF-I have been identified for the longest isoforms of human and rainbow trout E-peptides. These activities include dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation, inhibition of cancer cell metastasis and invasion through matrigel, suppression of cancer-induced angiogenesis, and attenuation of expression of apoptotic genes in favor of cell death. In this study, we were able to produce two-tagged recombinant human Eb-peptide (hEb) of pro-IGF-I with a purity over 99%. With its antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-like characteristics such as binding to the cytoplasmic membrane, and the affinity to the substratum of culture plate, hEb forms a layer of interface rapidly which facilitates the attachment of breast carcinoma cells, MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, the likely conformational change of homo-dimerized hEb through a single disulfide bond, as well as the ability to trigger clathrin-mediated endocytosis may play important roles for inducing lamellipodia outspread in MDA-MB-231 cells. With the highly purified hEb-peptide, not only could we study its function(s) in detail but also the minimum requirement for cancerous cells to metastasize to a suitable environment and grow.

Abstract: Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus infecting tomato plants worldwide. TYLCV needs a healthy host environment to ensure a successful infection cycle for long periods. Hence, TYLCV restrains its destructive effect and induces neither a hypersensitive response nor cell death in infected tomatoes. On the contrary, TYLCV counteracts cell death induced by other factors, such as inactivation of HSP90 functionality. Suppression of plant death is associated with the inhibition of the ubiquitin 26S proteasome degradation and with a deactivation of the heat shock transcription factor HSFA2 pathways (including decreased HSP17 levels). The goal of the current study was to find if the individual TYLCV genes were capable of suppressing HSP90-dependent death and HSFA2 deactivation. The expression of C2 (C3 and CP to a lesser extent) caused a decrease in the severity of death phenotypes, while the expression of V2 (C1 and C4 to a lesser extent) strengthened cell death. However, C2 or V2 markedly affected stress response under conditions of viral infection. The downregulation of HSFA2 signaling, initiated by the expression of C1 and V2, was detected in the absence of virus infection, but was enhanced in infected plants, while CP and C4 mitigated HSFA2 levels only in the infected tomatoes. The dependence of analyzed plant stress response suppression on the interaction of the expressed genes with the environment created by the whole virus infection was more pronounced than on the expression of individual TYLCV genes.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant apoptosis can lead to acute or chronic degenerative diseases. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) triggered by the oligomerization of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bax/Bak is an irreversible step leading to execution of apoptosis. Here, we describe the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of Bax/Bak oligomerization that prevent MOMP. We demonstrate that these molecules disrupt multiple, but not all, interactions between Bax dimer interfaces thereby interfering with the formation of higher-order oligomers in the MOM, but not recruitment of Bax to the MOM. Small-molecule inhibition of Bax/Bak oligomerization allowed cells to evade apoptotic stimuli and rescued neurons from death after excitotoxicity, demonstrating that oligomerization of Bax is essential for MOMP. Our discovery of small-molecule Bax/Bak inhibitors provides novel tools for the investigation of the mechanisms leading to MOMP and will ultimately facilitate development of compounds inhibiting Bax/Bak in acute and chronic degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), widely known for their beneficial effects onto male erectile dysfunction, seem to exert favorable effects onto metabolism as well. Tadalafil exposure increases oxidative metabolism of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. A rise in fatty acid (FA) metabolism, requiring more oxygen, could induce a larger reactive oxygen species (ROS) release as a byproduct thus leading to a redox imbalance. The aim of this study was to determine how PDE5I tadalafil influences redox status in skeletal muscle cells to match the increasing oxidative metabolism. To this purpose, differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were treated with tadalafil and analyzed for total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione levels as marker of redox status; enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) engaged in antioxidant defense; and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonyls (PrCar) as markers of oxidative damage. Tadalafil increased total intracellular glutathione (tGSH), CAT, SOD, and GPx enzymatic activities while no changes were found in TAC. A perturbation of redox status, as showed by the decrease in the ratio between reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), was observed. Nevertheless, it did not cause any change in TBARS and PrCar levels probably due to the enhancement in the antioxidant enzymatic network. Taken together, these data indicate that tadalafil, besides improving oxidative metabolism, may be beneficial to skeletal muscle cells by enhancing the enzymatic antioxidant system capacity.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA plays an important role in bone tissue engineering; however, its role and function in osteogenic differentiation warrant further investigation. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-375 was upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). Overexpression of miR-375 significantly enhanced hASCs osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of miR-375 inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. Mechanistically, microarray analysis revealed DEPTOR as a target of miR-375 in hASCs. Knockdown of DEPTOR accelerated the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs by inhibiting AKT signaling, which mimics miR-375 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-375 regulated osteogenesis by targeting YAP1, and that YAP1 reversely bound to miR-375 promoter to inhibit miR-375 expression. Taken together, our results suggested that miR-375 promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs via the YAP1/DEPTOR/AKT regulatory network, indicating that miR-375-targeted therapy might be a valuable approach to promote bone regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
In the microcirculation, pericytes are believed to function as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We hypothesized that the vasa vasorum harbor progenitor cells within the adventitia of human aorta. Pericytes, endothelial progenitor cells, and other cell subpopulations were detected among freshly isolated adventitial cells using flow cytometry. Purified cultured pericytes were enriched for the MSC markers CD105 and CD73 and depleted of the endothelial markers von Willebrand factor and CD31. Cultured pericytes were capable of smooth muscle lineage progression including inducible expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, and α-smooth muscle actin, and adopted a spindle shape. Pericytes formed spheroids when cultured on Matrigel substrates and peripherally localized with branching endothelial cells in vitro. Our results indicate that the vasa vasorum form a progenitor cell niche distinct from other previously described progenitor populations in human adventitia. These findings could have important implications for understanding the complex pathophysiology of human aortic disease.

Abstract: The advent of imatinib mesylate (IM) has dramatically improved the outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, but drug resistance, particularly in advanced stage of disease, portents eventual relapse and progression. To identify the candidate molecule responsible for resistance during IM treatment, an IM-resistant K562 cell line was generated by culturing in gradually increasing dose of IM. The expression of Nrf-2 and its downstream target, Gst-α, were significantly induced in these cells. GST-α, in turn, mediated cell survival by maintaining intracellular low level of 4-HNE. Inhibition of Nrf-2 effectively reduced the expression of Gst-α, resulting in accumulation of 4-HNE and elevated sensitiveness to IM. Moreover, in IM-sensitive K562 cells enforced Gst-α expression strikingly protected cells from the insult of IM. Finally, we also examined the levels of Nrf-2 in clinical bone morrow samples. Nrf-2 and Gst-α were more abundant in bone morrow of CML patients compared with that of healthy donors. In addition, Nrf-2 and Gst-α were further up-regulated in samples of patients with weak response to IM. In conclusion, our study shows that rapid clearance of 4-HNE by Nrf-2/GST may represents a novel molecular basis of IM resistance in CML.

Abstract: Summary
Both the promises and pitfalls of the cell reprogramming research platform rest on human genetic variation, making the measurement of its impact one of the most urgent issues in the field. Harnessing large transcriptomics datasets of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), we investigate the implications of this variability for iPSC-based disease modeling. In particular, we show that the widespread use of more than one clone per individual in combination with current analytical practices is detrimental to the robustness of the findings. We then proceed to identify methods to address this challenge and leverage multiple clones per individual. Finally, we evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of different sample sizes and experimental designs, presenting computational tools for power analysis. These findings and tools reframe the nature of replicates used in disease modeling and provide important resources for the design, analysis, and interpretation of iPSC-based studies.

Abstract: Background
Keloid is a skin fibrosis disease that characterised by invasive growth of fibroblasts and aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix. Studies indicated that keloid fibroblasts (KFs) is a class of ‘activated’ fibroblasts, which show accelerated proliferation and excessive extracellular matrix formation as compared with normal fibroblasts (NFs). However, the mechanism underlying keloid fibroblasts dysfunction is still unknown.
Objective
To verify CD26 expression difference between KFs and NFs, and investigate the function of CD26 positive fibroblasts in keloid progression.
Methods
KFs and NFs were isolated from Keloid tissues and normal skin tissues respectively. Flow cytometry was performed to isolate CD26+/CD26- fibroblasts from KFs and NFs. Proliferation of different fibroblasts were analyzed by CCK8 assay and Ki 67 straining. Profibrotic phenotype difference was detected by qRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA and immunofluorescence. Scratching experiment and transwell assay were used to assess invasion ability of CD26+/CD26- fibroblasts. Diprotin A was used as a CD26 inhibitor to further investigated the function of CD26 fibroblasts in keloid disease.
Result
CD26 expression was increased in KFs, and the proportion of CD26+ fibroblasts was significantly increased in KFs. Cell viability analysis showed that CD26+ fibroblasts was more active in proliferation. Furthermore, the expression of profibrotic genes were increased in CD26+ fibroblasts, including TGF-β1, IGF-1, IL6, collagen 1, collagen 3 and fibronectin. And meanwhile, CD26+ fibroblasts showed stronger invasion ability as compared to CD26- fibroblasts. Moreover, Diprotin A significantly suppressed proliferation and extracellular matrix secretion of CD26+ fibroblasts isolated from keloid tissues.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that CD26+ fibroblasts possess proliferation advantage in compare to CD26- fibroblasts, and the advantage caused expansion of CD26 positive fibroblast population promotes keloid progression.

Abstract: Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds containing natural substances with wound healing properties such as Emu oil (EO) may have a great potential for increasing the efficiency of stem cell-based skin bioengineering. For this purpose, EO blended PCL/PEG electrospun nanofibrous mats were successfully fabricated and characterized using FE-SEM, FTIR and Universal Testing Machine. The efficiency of the scaffolds in supporting the adherence, cytoprotection, proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to keratinocyte was evaluated. GC/MS and HPLC were used to determine the composition of pure EO, which revealed to be mainly fatty acids and carotenoids. FE-SEM and cell proliferation assays showed that adhesion and proliferation of ADSCs on EO-PCL/PEG nanofibers was significantly higher than on PCL/PEG nanofibers. Additionally, EO-PCL/PEG nanofibers with free radical scavenging properties conferred a cytoprotective effect against cell-damaging free radicals, while the ability to support cell adhesion and growth was maintained or even improved. Immunostaining of ADSCs on EO-PCL/PEG nanofibers confirmed the change in morphology of ADSCs from spindle to polygonal shape suggesting their differentiation toward an epidermal linage. Moreover, the expression levels of the keratin 10, filaggrin, and involucrin that are involved in epidermal differentiation were upregulated in a stage-specific manner. This preliminary study shows that EO-PCL/PEG nanofibers could be a good candidate for the fabrication of wound dressings and skin bioengineered substitutes with ADSCs.

Abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors with high metastatic potential. There being only a handful of publication on metastasis of STS, we investigated the miRNA mediated target gene regulations in modulating the metastatic processes in this cancer. In this study, we amalgamated gene and miRNA expression profiles of high-grade STS samples with miRNA target predictions and identified miR-429 targeting KIAA0101 as a novel pair, which remain unexplored in STS metastasis. We validated their expression in metastatic fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080 and performed several functional assays using miRNA mimics and KIAA0101 over-expression vector to confirm their role in metastasis. We observed miR-429 is downregulated in HT1080 cells and acting as an anti-metastatic miRNA that inhibited proliferation, migration, anchorage independent growth and invasion by de-repressing KIAA0101. Moreover, the renilla luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-429 targets KIAA0101 by binding to its 3/UTR and influence its expression. Taken together, our work demonstrated miR-429 mediates deregulation of KIAA0101 by acting as an anti-metastatic miRNA that targets KIAA0101 pro-metastatic gene during metastasis of STS.

Abstract: Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a grave clinical emergency and associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Based on the complex underlying mechanisms, a multimodal pharmacological approach seems necessary to prevent intestinal I/R injury. The antibiotic drug doxycycline, which exhibits a wide range of pleiotropic therapeutic properties, might be a promising candidate for also reducing I/R injury in the intestine. To investigate possible protective effects of doxycycline on intestinal I/R injury, human intestinal CaCo-2 cells were exposed to doxycycline at clinically relevant concentrations. In order to mimic I/R injury, CaCo-2 were thereafter subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation by using our recently described two-enzyme in-vitro hypoxia model. Investigations of cell morphology, cell damage, apoptosis and hydrogen peroxide formation were performed 24h after the hypoxic insult. Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury resulted in morphological signs of cell damage, elevated LDH concentrations in the respective culture media (P<0.001) and increased protein expression of proapoptotic caspase-3 (P<0.05) in the intestinal cultures. These events were associated with increased levels hydrogen peroxide (P<0.001). Preincubation of CaCo-2 cells with different concentrations of doxycycline (5µM, 10µM, 50µM) reduced the hypoxia induced signs of cell damage and LDH release (P<0.001 for all concentrations). The reduction of cellular damage was associated with a reduced expression of caspase-3 (5µM, P<0.01; 10µM, P<0.01; 50µM, P<0.05), while hydrogen peroxide levels remained unchanged. In summary, doxycycline protects human intestinal cells from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in-vitro. Further animal and clinical studies are required to prove the protective potential of doxycycline on intestinal I/R injury under in-vivo conditions.

Abstract: To understand the molecular association between inflammation and dysregulated metabolism in glioblastoma, the effect of IL-1β on Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression was investigated. IL-1β induced HK2 expression was accompanied by heightened SIRT6 and MZF1 levels. IL-1β mediated overall decrease in chromatin compactness on HK2 promoter involved diminished nucleosomal occupancy around the most labile region bearing MZF1 sites. Importantly, SIRT6 and MZF1 served as negative regulators of HK2. Ectopic SIRT6 induced formation and recruitment of MZF1-SIRT6 complex to MZF1 site was concomitant with increased nucleosomal occupancy. The function of SIRT6 as co-repressor of MZF1 was inconspicuous in cells treated with IL-1β alone, as IL-1β-induced HIF-1α prevented SIRT6 availability for interaction with MZF1. Taken together, SIRT6 over-expression establishes a condition whereby reconfiguration of the HK2 promoter chromatin structure makes it receptive to interaction with MZF1/SIRT6 complex, thereby favouring a regulatory state conducive to diminished transcription.

Here we describe how to apply spinning disk live cell imaging and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to define the dynamics and structural organization of abscission and of proteins involved in abscission in a quantitative manner. We further provide a protocol to correlate the structural data, obtained by SIM, to the dynamic information obtained by live cell recordings.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins involved in cellular repair and protective mechanisms. They counter protein misfolding and aggregation that are characteristic features of neurodegenerative diseases. Hsps act co-operatively in disaggregation/refolding machines that assemble at sites of protein misfolding and aggregation. Members of the DNAJ (Hsp40) family act as “holdases” that detect and bind misfolded proteins, while members of the HSPA (Hsp70) family act as “foldases” that refold proteins to biologically active states. HSPH1 (Hsp105α) is an important additional member of the mammalian disaggregation/refolding machine that acts as a disaggregase to promote the dissociation of aggregated proteins. Components of a disaggregation/refolding machine were targeted to nuclear speckles after thermal stress in differentiated human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, namely: HSPA1A (Hsp70-1), DNAJB1 (Hsp40-1), DNAJA1 (Hsp40-4), and HSPH1 (Hsp105α). Nuclear speckles are rich in RNA splicing factors, and heat shock disrupts RNA splicing which recovers after stressful stimuli. Interestingly, constitutively expressed HSPA8 (Hsc70) was also targeted to nuclear speckles after heat shock with elements of a disaggregation/refolding machine. Hence, neurons have the potential to rapidly assemble a disaggregation/refolding machine after cellular stress using constitutively expressed Hsc70 without the time lag needed for synthesis of stress-inducible Hsp70. Constitutive Hsc70 is abundant in neurons in the mammalian brain and has been proposed to play a role in pre-protecting neurons from cellular stress.

Abstract: We report optimized methods for preparing actin-intact Xenopus egg extract. This extract is minimally perturbed, undiluted egg cytoplasm where the cell cycle can be experimentally controlled. It contains abundant organelles and glycogen and supports active metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics that closely mimic egg physiology. The concentration of the most abundant ∼11,000 proteins is known from mass spectrometry. Actin-intact egg extract can be used for analysis of actin dynamics and interaction of actin with other cytoplasmic systems, as well as microtubule organization. It can be spread as thin layers and naturally depletes oxygen though mitochondrial metabolism, which makes it ideal for fluorescence imaging. When combined with artificial lipid bilayers, it allows reconstitution and analysis of the spatially controlled signaling that positions the cleavage furrow during early cytokinesis. Actin-intact extract is generally useful for probing the biochemistry and biophysics of the large Xenopus egg. Protocols are provided for preparation of actin-intact egg extract, control of the cell cycle, fluorescent probes for cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-dependent signaling, preparation of glass surfaces for imaging experiments, and immunodepletion to probe the role of specific proteins and protein complexes. We also describe methods for adding supported lipid bilayers to mimic the plasma membrane and for confining in microfluidic droplets to explore size scaling issues.

Abstract: Summary
In the seminiferous tubules of mouse testes, a population of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 1 (GFRα1)-positive spermatogonia harbors the stem cell functionality and supports continual spermatogenesis, likely independent of asymmetric division or definitive niche control. Here, we show that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes spermatogonial differentiation and reduces the GFRα1+ cell pool. We further discovered that SHISA6 is a cell-autonomous Wnt inhibitor that is expressed in a restricted subset of GFRα1+ cells and confers resistance to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Shisa6+ cells appear to show stem cell-related characteristics, conjectured from the morphology and long-term fates of T (Brachyury)+ cells that are found largely overlapped with Shisa6+ cells. This study proposes a generic mechanism of stem cell regulation in a facultative (or open) niche environment, with which different levels of a cell-autonomous inhibitor (SHISA6, in this case) generates heterogeneous resistance to widely distributed differentiation-promoting extracellular signaling, such as WNTs.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the common cause of death from cancer, and most lung cancer patients die of metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors, playing crucial role not only in tumorigenesis, but also in tumor invasion and metastasis. There are several studies showed that miR-26a is involved in carcinogenesis, however, its role in tumor metastasis need to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that ectopic expression of miR-26a enhanced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) was identified as a direct target of miR-26a. GSK3β expression negatively correlated with miR-26a expression in lung cancer tissues. Silencing of GSK3β achieved similar effect as miR-26a over-expression; over-expression of GSK3β reversed the enhanced effect of miR-26a on lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Further study indicated that miR-26a increased β-catenin expression and nuclear translocation. C-myc and cyclin D1, the downstream genes of β-catenin, were also up-regulated by miR-26a. Furthermore, xenograft study showed that miR-26a promoted lung cancer cell growth in vivo, and suppressed GSK3β expression. Collectively, our results demonstrated that miR-26a enhanced metastatic potential of lung cancer cells via activation of β-catenin pathway by targeting GSK3β, suggesting the potential applicability of miR-26a as a target for cancer treatment.

Abstract: HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is characterized by heavy proteinuria, rapidly progressive renal failure, and distinct morphological features in the kidney. HIV-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critically important for the progression of kidney injury. In this study, we tested the role of hedgehog pathway in the HIV-induced EMT and fibrosis of kidney. We used the Tg26 mice, the abundantly used HIVAN mouse model, to investigate the activation of hedgehog pathway by HIV. Western blotting and real time PCR results showed that renal tissue expression of hedgehog pathway related molecules, including hedgehog homologous (Shh, Ihh, Dhh), PTCH, and Gli1, were increased in HIVAN (Tg26) mice; while immunofluorescent staining displayed localization PTCH expression in podocytes. For in vitro studies, we used recombinant sonic hedgehog (Shh) and HIV for their expression by podocytes. Both the methods activated the hedgehog pathway, enhanced the expression of EMT markers, and decreased impermeability. Overexpression of Gli1 by human podocytes also augmented their expression of EMT markers. On the other hand, the blockade of hedgehog pathway with Gant 58, a specific blocker for Gli1-induced transcription, dramatically decreased HIV-induced podocyte EMT and permeability. These results indicate that hedgehog pathway plays an important role in HIV-induced podocyte injury. The present study provides mechanistical insight into a new target for therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Polycystin-2 (PC2, TRPP2) is a nonselective cation channel whose dysfunction is associated with the onset of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). PC2 contributes to Ca2+ transport and cell signaling in renal epithelia and other tissues. Little is known however, as to the external Ca2+ regulation of PC2 channel function. In this study, we explored the effect of external Ca2+ on endogenous PC2 in wild type LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells. We obtained whole cell currents at different external Ca2+ concentrations, and observed that the basal whole cell conductance in normal Ca2+(1.2mM), decreased by 30.2% in zero (nominal) Ca2+ and conversely, increased by 38% in high external Ca2+(6.2mM). The high Ca2+-increased whole cell currents were completely inhibited by either PC2 gene silencing, or intracellular dialysis with active, but not denatured by boiling, PC2 antibody. Exposure of cells to high Ca2+ was also associated with relocation of PC2 to the plasma membrane. To explore whether a Ca2+ sensing receptor (CaSR) was implicated in the external Ca2+ modulation of PC2 currents, we tested the effect of the CaSR agonists, spermine and the calcimimetic R-568, which largely mimicked the effect of high Ca2+ under Ca2+-free conditions. The CaSR agonist gentamicin also increased the PC2 currents in the presence of normal Ca2+. The presence of CaSR was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, which partially colocalized with the intracellular PC2 protein, in an external Ca2+-dependent manner. The data support a novel Ca2+ sensing mechanism for PC2 expression and functional regulation in renal epithelial cells.

Abstract: The Wound Healing (WH) assay is widely used to investigate cell migration in vitro, in order to reach a better understanding of many physiological and pathological phenomena. Several experimental factors, such as uneven cell density among different samples, can affect the reproducibility and reliability of this assay, leading to a discrepancy in the wound closure kinetics among data sets corresponding to the same cell sample. We observed a linear relationship between the wound closure velocity and cell density, and suggested a novel methodological approach, based on transport phenomena concepts, to overcome this source of error on the analysis of the Wound Healing assay. In particular, we propose a simple scaling of the experimental data, based on the interpretation of the wound closure as a diffusion-reaction process. We applied our methodology to the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whose motility was perturbed by silencing or over-expressing genes involved in the control of cell migration. Our methodological approach leads to a significant improvement in the reproducibility and reliability in the in vitro WH assay.

Abstract: Dysplastic hepatocytes (DH) represent altered hepatocytes with potential for malignant transformation. To date, most research on pathways to hepatocarcinogenesis has focused on use of “hepatoma” cell lines derived from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We describe a novel technique for deriving/culturing DH and demonstrate their utility for functional studies in vitro, compared to primary hepatocytes (PH) and HCC. PH and DH were prepared by portal vein collagenase perfusion from C57BL/6J mice. DH were subsequently subjected to FACS. HCC from diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-injected mice were mechanically isolated. Cell cycle analyses were performed by flow cytometry and PCNA immunohistochemistry. To establish utility of DH, we studied pathways of p53 turnover, apoptosis and cell proliferation using pfithrin-α (PFT) and nutlin-3. Like PH, DH were minimally proliferative compared to HCC. Only 30±0.03% of DH were in G2/M phase versus 51±0.01% of HCC; this difference corroborated with PCNA-immunostaining of dysplastic nodules from DEN-injected mice. In DH and HCC, nutlin-3 suppressed p53 mRNA, induced p53 and mdm2 activation but paradoxically resulted in increased anti-apoptotic and proliferative activity. Primary murine DH display distinctive biological characteristics compared with PH and HCC. As an intermediate cell type to HCC, they offer a new pathobiologically relevant primary cell culture system with which to interrogate the molecular changes in hepatocarcinogenesis.

Abstract: Thermotherapy, as a method of treating cancer, has recently attracted considerable attention from basic and clinical investigators. A number of studies and clinical trials have shown that thermotherapy can be successfully used as a therapeutic approach for various cancers. However, the effects of temperature on cancer bioenergetics have not been studied in detail with a real time, microplate based, label-free detection approach. This study investigates how changes in temperature affect the bioenergetics characteristics (mitochondrial function and glycolysis) of three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines utilizing the Seahorse XF96 technology. Experiments were performed at 32°C, 37°C and 42°C using assay medium conditions and equipment settings adjusted to produce equal oxygen and pH levels ubiquitously at the beginning of all experiments. The results suggest that temperature significantly changes multiple components of glycolytic and mitochondrial function of all cell lines tested. Under hypothermia conditions (32°C), the extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) of CRC cells were significantly lower compared to the same basal ECAR levels measured at 37°C. Mitochondrial stress test for SW480 cells at 37°C vs 42°C demonstrated increased proton leak while all other OCR components remained unchanged (similar results were detected also for the patient-derived xenograft cells Pt.93). Interestingly, the FCCP dose response at 37°C vs 42°C show significant shifts in profiles, suggesting that single dose FCCP experiments might not be sufficient to characterize the mitochondrial metabolic potential when comparing groups, conditions or treatments. These findings provide valuable insights for the metabolic and bioenergetic changes of CRC cells under hypo- and hyperthermia conditions that could potentially lead to development of better targeted and personalized strategies for patients undergoing combined thermotherapy with chemotherapy.

Abstract: Migration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) plays an important role in many physiological and pathological settings, including wound healing. During the migration of BMSCs through interstitial tissues, the movement of the nucleus must be coordinated with the cytoskeletal dynamics, which in turn affects the cell migration efficiency. Our previous study indicated that osteopontin (OPN) significantly promotes the migration of rat BMSCs. However, the nuclear behaviors and involved molecular mechanisms in OPN-mediated BMSC migration are largely unclear. In the present study, using an atomic force microscope (AFM), we found that OPN could decrease the nuclear stiffness of BMSCs and reduce the expression of lamin A/C, which is the main determinant of nuclear stiffness. Increased lamin A/C expression attenuates BMSC migration by increasing nuclear stiffness. Decreased lamin A/C expression promotes BMSC migration by decreasing nuclear stiffness. Furthermore, OPN promotes BMSC migration by diminishing lamin A/C expression and decreasing nuclear stiffness via the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This study provides strong evidence for the role of nuclear mechanics in BMSC migration as well as new insight into the molecular mechanisms of OPN-promoted BMSC migration.

Abstract: Neural stem and progenitor cells in the developing cerebral cortex, but also when grown in culture, display a range of distinct phenomena during cytokinesis. Cleavage furrow ingression in neural progenitor cells can bisect their basal processes and, later on, result in midbody formation at the apical surface. After abscission, these midbodies are released as membrane-bound particles into the extracellular space, in contrast to uptake and degradation of postabscission midbodies in other cell types. Whether these cellular dynamics are unique to neural stem cells, or more ubiquitously found, and what biological significance these processes have for cell differentiation or cell–cell communication, are open questions that require a combination of approaches. Here, we discuss techniques to study the specific membrane dynamics underlying the basal process splitting and postabscission midbody release in neural stem cells. We provide some basic concepts and protocols to isolate, enrich and stain released midbodies, and follow midbody dynamics over time. Moreover, we discuss techniques to prepare cortical sections for high-voltage electron microscopy to visualize the fine basal processes of progenitor cells.

Abstract: The cell surface protein Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1) marks stem or progenitor cells in several murine tissues and is normally upregulated during cancer development. Although the specific function of Sca-1 remains unknown, Sca-1 seems to play a role in proliferation, differentiation and cell migration in a number of tissues. In the skin epithelium, Sca-1 is highly expressed in the interfollicular epidermis but is absent in most compartments of the hair follicle; however, the function of Sca-1 in the skin has not been investigated. To explore the role of Sca-1 in normal and malignant skin development we generated transgenic mice that express Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells that are normally Sca-1 negative. Development of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis appeared normal in Sca-1 mutant mice; however, follicular induction of Sca-1 expression in bulge region and isthmus stem cells reduced the overall yield of papillomas in a chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Despite that fewer papillomas developed in transgenic mice a higher proportion of the papillomas underwent malignant conversion. These findings suggest that overexpression of Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells contributes at different stages of tumour development. In early stages, overexpression of Sca-1 decreases tumour formation while at later stages overexpression of Sca-1 seems to drive tumours towards malignant progression.

Abstract: As cancers develop, transformed cells hijack various host mechanisms and manipulate them to create a dynamic tumor microenvironment, which supports tumor growth. This protumorigenic microenvironment is made up of many different cell types, including transformed cells, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and endothelial cells, the interactions of which have been shown to play a role in sustaining tumor growth. Multiple reports implicate the inflammatory cells of the tumor microenvironment as having both pro- and antitumorigenic roles, the balance of which is vital for the progression of the tumor, and while our understanding of established cancers has vastly increased since the turn of the 21st Century, our knowledge of these cellular interactions at the earliest stages of cancer initiation and development remains relatively limited. This is largely due to difficulties in monitoring these processes in vivo and in real time. Since the late nineties, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a vital model organism, allowing studies of previously unattainable stages of tumor initiation in a vertebrate model system. Using genetic and live-imaging approaches, this model system can be used both independently to monitor stages of tumor progression from the earliest initiation stages and incorporated into previously established systems to investigate the interactions between cancer cells and the various cell types of the tumor microenvironment, including inflammatory cells. Here, we describe the use of an inducible KalTA4-ERT2/UAS expression system in zebrafish, which allows spatial and temporal control of preneoplastic cell (PNC) growth and monitoring of innate immune cells in response to the developing PNC microenvironment.

Abstract: Rab22a is a member of the Ras-related small GTPase family, which plays a key role in regulating the recycling of cargo proteins entering cells through clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). Rab22a is overexpressed in different cancer types, including liver cancer, malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma. However, its oncogenic role remains unknown. In this study, we found that silencing of Rab22a suppressed the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, Rab22a interacts with CD147, and knockdown of Rab22a blocks CD147 recycling and promotes CD147 degradation. Taken together, our findings indicate that Rab22a enhances recycling of CD147, which is required for lung cancer cell migration and invasion,and targeting CD147 recycling may be a rational strategy for lung cancer therapy.

Abstract: Epithelial tissue cohesiveness is ensured through cell–cell junctions that maintain both adhesion and mechanical coupling between neighboring cells. During development, epithelial tissues undergo intensive cell proliferation. Cell division, and particularly cytokinesis, is coupled to the formation of new adhesive contacts, thereby preserving tissue integrity and propagating cell polarity. Remarkably, the geometry of the new interfaces is determined by the combined action of the dividing cell and its neighbors. To further understand the interplay between the dividing cell and its neighbors, as well as the role of cell division for tissue morphogenesis, it is important to analyze cytokinesis in vivo. Here we present methods to perform live imaging of cell division in Drosophila epithelial tissues and discuss some aspects of image processing and analysis.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor. Gliomas exhibit high genetic diversity in addition to complex and variable clinical features. Glioblastoma tumors are highly resistant to multimodal therapies and there is significant patient mortality within the first two years after prognosis. At present clinical treatments are palliative, not curative. Glioblastomas contain a high number of microglia and infiltrating macrophages, which are positively correlated with glioma grade and invasiveness. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. These cells constantly scan the brain and react promptly to any abnormality, removing detrimental factors and safeguarding the central nervous system against further damage. Microglia and macrophages that have colonized the glioblastoma display protumoral functions and promote tumor growth. The optically transparent zebrafish larva facilitates imaging of fluorescently labeled cells at high spatial and temporal resolution in vivo. It is therefore an excellent model to investigate microglia-glioma cell interactions at the early stages of tumor development. Here we provide several methods that can be used to study the early stages of microglia-glioma cell interactions in the zebrafish. We present a technique for the xenotransplantation of mammalian oncogenic cells into the zebrafish brain and provide advice for image capture and analysis.

Abstract: Summary
The incomplete differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) poses a serious safety risk owing to their potential tumorigenicity, hindering their clinical application. Here, we explored the potential of phospho-D-peptides as novel iPSC-eliminating agents. Alkaline phosphatases overexpressed on iPSCs dephosphorylate phospho-D-peptides into hydrophobic peptides that aggregate and induce cell death. We isolated a peptide candidate, D-3, that selectively and rapidly induced toxicity in iPSCs within 1 hr but had little influence on various non-iPSCs, including primary hepatocytes and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Two hours of D-3 treatment efficiently eliminated iPSCs from both single cultures and co-cultures spiked with increasing ratios of iPSCs. In addition, D-3 prevented residual iPSC-induced teratoma formation in a mouse tumorigenicity assay. These results suggest the enormous potential of D-3 as a low-cost and effective anti-iPSC agent for both laboratory use and for the safe clinical application of iPSC-derived cells in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members are ubiquitously expressed and play a key role in cellular processes, including DNA repair and cell death/survival balance. Accordingly, PARP inhibition is an emerging pharmacological strategy for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Consistent evidences support the critical involvement of PARP family members in cell differentiation and phenotype maturation. In this study we used an oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) enriched system derived from fetal and adult brain to investigate the role of PARP in OPCs proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The PARP inhibitors PJ34, TIQ-A and Olaparib were used as pharmacological tools. The main results of the study are: (i) PARP mRNA expression and PARP activity are much higher in fetal than in adult-derived OPCs; (ii) the culture treatment with PARP inhibitors is cytotoxic for OPCs derived from fetal, but not from adult, brain; (iii) PARP inhibition reduces cell number, according to the inhibitory potency of the compounds; (iv) PARP inhibition effect on fetal OPCs is a slow process; (v) PARP inhibition impairs OPCs maturation into myelinating OL in fetal, but not in adult cultures, according to the inhibitory potency of the compounds. These results have implications for PARP-inhibition therapies for diseases and lesions of the central nervous system, in particular for neonatal hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.

Abstract: Myofibroblasts are specialized cells that play a key role in connective tissue remodeling and reconstruction. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), vimentin and tenascin-C are myofibroblast phenotype, while α-SMA is the phenotypic marker. The observation that human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) differentiate into myofibroblasts under orthodontic force has provided a new perspective for understanding of the biological and biomechanical mechanisms involved in orthodontic tooth movement. However, the cell-specific molecular mechanisms leading to myofibroblast differentiation in the periodontal ligament (PDL) remain unclear. In this study, we found that expression of Wnt3α, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-SMA and tenascin-C increased in both tension and compression regions of the PDL under orthodontic load compared with unloaded control, suggesting that upregulated Wnt3α and TGF-β1 signaling might have roles in myofibroblast differentiation in response to orthodontic force. We reveal in vitro that both Wnt3α and TGF-β1 promote myofibroblast differentiation from hPDLCs. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) impairs Wnt3α-induced myofibroblast differentiation in a β-catenin-dependent manner. TGF-β1 stimulates myofibroblast differentiation via a JNK-dependent mechanism. DKK1 has no significant effect on TGF-β1-induced myofibroblastic phenotype.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is an essential cellular event that completes the cell division cycle. It begins with the assembly of an actomyosin contractile ring that undergoes constriction concomitant with the septum formation to divide the cell in two. Placement of the septum at the right position is important to ensure fidelity of the division process. In fission yeast, the medially placed nucleus is a major spatial cue to position the site of division. In this chapter, we describe a simple synthetic biology-based approach to displace the nucleus and study the consequence on division site positioning. We also describe how to perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to follow the dynamics of cytokinetic proteins at defined time points by live-cell microscopy.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play an important role in insulin resistance and improve the cellular stress response via HSP induction by exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. In this study, the effects of exercise-induced HSP72 expression levels on whole-body insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats were investigated. Male 25-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats were divided into three groups: sedentary (Sed), trained in a thermal-neutral environment (NTr: 25 °C), and trained in a cold environment (CTr: 4 °C). Exercise training was conducted 5 days/week for 10 weeks. Rectal temperature was measured following each bout of exercise. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed after the training sessions. The serum, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver were sampled 48 h after the final exercise session. HSP72 and heat shock cognate protein 73 expression levels were analyzed by Western blot, and serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured. NTr animals exhibited significantly higher body temperatures following exercise, whereas, CTr animals did not. Exercise training increased HSP72 levels in the gastrocnemius muscle and liver, whereas, HSP72 expression was significantly lower in the CTr group than that in the NTr group (p < 0.05). Glucose tolerance improved equally in both trained animals; however, insulin levels during the IPGTT were higher in CTr animals than those in NTr animals (p < 0.05). In addition, the TG and FFA levels decreased significantly only in NTr animals compared with those in Sed animals. These results suggest that attenuation of exercise-induced HSP72 expression partially blunts improvement in whole-body insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats.

Abstract: Summary
Selenomabs are engineered monoclonal antibodies with one or more translationally incorporated selenocysteine residues. The unique reactivity of the selenol group of selenocysteine permits site-specific conjugation of drugs. Compared with other natural and unnatural amino acid and carbohydrate residues that have been used for the generation of site-specific antibody-drug conjugates, selenocysteine is particularly reactive, permitting fast, single-step, and efficient reactions under near physiological conditions. Using a tailored conjugation chemistry, we generated highly stable selenomab-drug conjugates and demonstrated their potency and selectivity in vitro and in vivo. These site-specific antibody-drug conjugates built on a selenocysteine interface revealed broad therapeutic utility in liquid and solid malignancy models.

Abstract: Summary
Although valproic acid (VPA), has been shown to induce neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigated if and how mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is involved in the neuronal differentiation of VPA-induced NSCs. Our data demonstrated that mTOR activation not only promoted but also was necessary for the neuronal differentiation of NSCs induced by VPA. We further found that inhibition of mTOR signaling blocked demethylation of neuron-specific gene neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) regulatory element in induced cells. These are correlated with the significant alterations of passive DNA demethylation and the active DNA demethylation pathway in the Ngn1 promoter, but not the suppression of lysine-specific histone methylation and acetylation in the promoter region of Ngn1. These findings highlight a potentially important role for mTOR signaling, by working together with DNA demethylation, to influence the fate of NSCs via regulating the expression of Ngn1 in VPA-induced neuronal differentiation of NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative stress influences stem cell behavior by promoting the differentiation, proliferation, or apoptosis of stem cells. Thus, characterizing the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on stem cell behavior provides insights into the significance of redox homeostasis in stem cell-associated diseases and efficient stem cell expansion for cellular therapies. We utilized the Drosophila testis as an in vivo model to examine the effects of ROS on germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance. High levels of ROS induced by alteration in Keap1/Nrf2 activity decreased GSC number by promoting precocious GSC differentiation. Notably, high ROS enhanced the transcription of the EGFR ligand spitz and the expression of phospho-Erk1/2, suggesting that high ROS-mediated GSC differentiation is through EGFR signaling. By contrast, testes with low ROS caused by Keap1 inhibition or antioxidant treatment showed an overgrowth of GSC-like cells. These findings suggest that redox homeostasis regulated by Keap1/Nrf2 signaling plays important roles in GSC maintenance.

Abstract: Androgens (AR) play an important role in initiation and progression of prostate cancer. It has been shown that AR exert their effects mainly through the androgen-activated AR which binds to androgen response elements (AREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes to regulate the transcription of androgen-responsive genes, thus, identification of AR downstream target gene is critical to understand androgen function in prostate cancer. In this study, our results showed that androgen treatment of LNCaP cells induced PTTG1 expression, which was blocked by the androgen receptor antagonist, Casodex. Bioinformatics analysis and experiments using PTTG1 promoter deletion mutants showed that the PTTG1 promoter contains a putative androgen response element (ARE), which localizes in the −851 to −836 region of the promoter. Androgen activated androgen receptor (AR) binding to this ARE was confirmed by Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Furthermore, Knockdown of PTTG1 expression using short hairpin RNA significantly reduced androgen-induced LNCaP cell growth and invasion. In addition, we showed PTTG1 is highly expressed in metastasis prostate cancer tissue. These results suggest that PTTG1 is a novel downstream target gene of androgen receptor and take part in prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes microcephaly in a subset of infants born to infected pregnant mothers. It is unknown whether human individual differences contribute to differential susceptibility of ZIKV-related neuropathology. Here, we use an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain, isolated from the 2015 Mexican outbreak (Mex1-7), to infect primary human neural stem cells (hNSCs) originally derived from three individual fetal brains. All three strains of hNSCs exhibited similar rates of Mex1-7 infection and reduced proliferation. However, Mex1-7 decreased neuronal differentiation in only two of the three stem cell strains. Correspondingly, ZIKA-mediated transcriptome alterations were similar in these two strains but significantly different from that of the third strain with no ZIKV-induced neuronal reduction. This study thus confirms that an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain infects primary hNSCs and demonstrates a cell-strain-dependent response of hNSCs to ZIKV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis are characterized by dysregulated responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Pharmacologic anti-cytokine therapies are often effective at diminishing this inflammatory response but have significant side effects and are used at high, constant doses that do not reflect the dynamic nature of disease activity. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering system, we created stem cells that antagonize IL-1- or TNF-α-mediated inflammation in an autoregulated, feedback-controlled manner. Our results show that genome engineering can be used successfully to rewire endogenous cell circuits to allow for prescribed input/output relationships between inflammatory mediators and their antagonists, providing a foundation for cell-based drug delivery or cell-based vaccines via a rapidly responsive, autoregulated system. The customization of intrinsic cellular signaling pathways in stem cells, as demonstrated here, opens innovative possibilities for safer and more effective therapeutic approaches for a wide variety of diseases.

Abstract: Mechanotransduction is important for mesenchymal regeneration and differentiation. Exaggerated high or very low impact yields pathological outcome resulting in fracture or tissue atrophy. Pathological strain in animal models was described but tools to dissect the respective stimuli and downstream pathways are limited. We expand the analytical tools to describe DNA strain response elements in a reporter gene approach. Deletion constructs of the human cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61) promoter were cloned into luciferase vectors and stably transfected into human telomerase-immortalised mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC-TERT). Cells were mechanically stimulated with variable frequencies, amplitudes and durations. Promoter activity was determined as well as CYR61 mRNA and protein expression. In silico promoter analysis identified putative transcription factor binding sites, one of which was a cAMP response element, verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We demonstrate for the first time that the activity of promoter regions is inhibited in low, but stimulated in high frequency stimulations. We conclude that by varying conditions of mechanical strain it is possible to characterize stimulatory versus inhibitory strain on cellular levels. Our work may be helpful in future studies to dissect the molecular pathways of physiological versus pathological strain and may have implications for clinical exercise based treatment strategies.

Abstract: Upregulation of glycolysis was often observed in human HER2-overexpressing cancers. In this study, we demonstrated that KU004, a dual novel EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, disrupted cancer cell proliferation via modulation of glycolysis. KU004, inhibited the Warburg effect by suppressing hexokinase II (HK2) expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Further study demonstrated that the downregulation of HKII by KU004 was mainly mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the role of HKII downregulation in KU004-mediated antitumor effect was also confirmed in our in vivo xenograft model. Collectively, these data suggest that multifaceted targeting the aberrant glucose metabolism along with the upstream HER2 may be an effective approach for clinical treatment against HER2+ cancer.

Abstract: The midbody (MB) is a microtubule-rich structure that forms between dividing cells during final stages of cytokinesis. Previously thought to be a transient structure, MBs are now suggested to have additional roles beyond regulating cytokinesis. While the role MBs play during abscission are now well established, their function in regulating polarity and cell signaling are only beginning to be understood. Due to the newly found interest in the structure and functions of MBs, new techniques must be developed for further studies of this once-thought transient structure. Here, we describe several approaches used to explore postmitotic roles of the MBs.

Abstract: CXCR4 and CXCR7 are prominent G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). This study demonstrates that CXCR4 and CXCR7 induce differential effects during cardiac lineage differentiation and β-adrenergic response in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Using lentiviral vectors to ablate CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 expression, hiPSC-CMs were tested for phenotypic and functional properties due to gene knockdown. Gene expression and flow cytometry confirmed the pluripotent and cardiomyocyte phenotype of undifferentiated and differentiated hiPSCs, respectively. Although reduction of CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression resulted in a delayed cardiac phenotype, only knockdown of CXCR4 delayed the spontaneous beating of hiPSC-CMs. Knockdown of CXCR4 and CXCR7 differentially altered calcium transients and β-adrenergic response in hiPSC-CMs. In engineered cardiac tissues, depletion of CXCR4 or CXCR7 had opposing effects on developed force and chronotropic response to β-agonists. This work demonstrates distinct roles for the SDF-1/CXCR4 or CXCR7 network in hiPSC-derived ventricular cardiomyocyte specification, maturation and function.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes from familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients or transgenic mice are toxic specifically to motor neurons (MNs). It is not known if astrocytes from sporadic ALS (sALS) patients cause MN degeneration in vivo and whether the effect is specific to MNs. By transplanting spinal neural progenitors, derived from sALS and healthy induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), into the cervical spinal cord of adult SCID mice for 9 months, we found that differentiated human astrocytes were present in large areas of the spinal cord, replaced endogenous astrocytes, and contacted neurons to a similar extent. Mice with sALS but not non-ALS cells showed reduced non-MNs numbers followed by MNs in the host spinal cord. The surviving MNs showed reduced inputs from inhibitory neurons and exhibited disorganized neurofilaments and aggregated ubiquitin. Correspondingly, mice with sALS but not non-ALS cells showed declined movement deficits. Thus, sALS iPSC-derived astrocytes cause ALS-like degeneration in both MNs and non-MNs.

Abstract: Human fertility is dependent upon the correct establishment and differentiation of the germline. This is because no other cell type in the body is capable of passing a genome and epigenome from parent to child. Terminally differentiated germline cells in the adult testis and ovary are called gametes. However, the initial specification of germline cells occurs in the embryo around the time of gastrulation. Most of our knowledge regarding the cell and molecular events that govern human germline specification involves extrapolating scientific principles from model organisms, most notably the mouse. However, recent work using next generation sequencing, gene editing and differentiation of germline cells from pluripotent stem cells has revealed that the core molecular mechanisms that regulate human germline development are different from rodents. Here, we will discuss the major molecular pathways required for human germline differentiation and how pluripotent stem cells have revolutionized our ability to study the earliest steps in human embryonic lineage specification in order to understand human fertility.

Abstract: Summary
Two populations of oligodendrogenic progenitors co-exist within the corpus callosum (CC) of the adult mouse. Local, parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (pOPCs) and progenitors generated in the subependymal zone (SEZ) cytogenic niche. pOPCs are committed perinatally and retain their numbers through self-renewing divisions, while SEZ-derived cells are relatively “young,” being constantly born from neural stem cells. We compared the behavior of these populations, labeling SEZ-derived cells using hGFAP:CreErt2 mice, within the homeostatic and regenerating CC of the young-adult and aging brain. We found that SEZ-derived oligodendroglial progenitors have limited self-renewing potential and are therefore not bona fide OPCs but rather “oligodendroblasts” more similar to the neuroblasts of the neurogenic output of the SEZ. In the aged CC their mitotic activity is much reduced, although they still act as a “fast-response element” to focal demyelination. In contrast to pOPCs, they fail to generate mature myelinating oligodendrocytes at all ages studied.

Abstract: As a direct consequence of hyperglycaemia, the excessive generation of ROS is central to the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize that stimulation of high glucose (HG) results in an increased sulfiredoxin (Srx) expression, which regulates ROS signaling through reducing the hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prxs). We show that hyperoxidized Prxs were initially reduced in the preliminary stage but then dramatically increased in advanced stage and these changes corresponded to a significant increase of Srx expression in the heart of diabetic rats. These time-dependent changes were also confirmed in neonatal cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells treated with HG. Moreover, the reduction rate of hyperoxidized Prxs was greatly improved in the HG 24h group, which had an elevated expression of Srx. Our data also show that HG-induced AP1 activation and Srx expression were almost abolished by JNK inhibitor and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In addition, siRNA-Srx suppressed HG-induced ANP and β-MHC gene expression. These observations suggest that activation of AP1 induced by HG is important for the expression of Srx and the reduction of hyperoxidized Prxs in cardiomyocytes. This Srx induction maybe is the pivotal compensatory protection mechanism against oxidative stress in diabetes or hyperglycaemia. Most interestingly, hyperoxidized Prxs/Srx pathway may be involved in the cardiac hypertrophy signaling of diabetes.

Abstract: Chromosome instability, frequently found in cancer cells, is caused by a deficiency in cell division, including centrosomal amplification and cytokinesis failure, and can result in abnormal chromosome content or aneuploidy. The small GTPase pathways have been implicated as important processes in cell division. We found that knockdown of a tumor suppressor protein Kank1 increases the number of cells with a micronucleus or bi-/multi-nuclei, which was likely caused by centrosomal amplification. Kank1 interacts with Daam1, known to bind to and activate a small GTPase, RhoA, in actin assembly. Knockdown of Kank1 or overexpression of Daam1, respectively, hyperactivates RhoA, potentially leading to the modulation of the activity of Aurora-A, a key regulator of centrosomal functions, eventually resulting in centrosomal amplification. Kank1 is also associated with contractile ring formation in collaboration with RhoA, and its deficiency results in the interruption of normal daughter cell separation, generating multinucleate cells. Such abnormal segregation of chromosomes may cause further chromosomal instability and abnormal gene functions, leading to tumorigenesis. Thus, Kank1 plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of RhoA through retrieving excess Daam1 and balancing the activities of RhoA and its effectors.

Abstract: Tissue or cell transplantation is an invaluable technique with a multitude of applications including studying the developmental potential of certain cell populations, dissecting cell-environment interactions, and identifying stem cells. One key technical requirement for performing transplantation assays is the capability of distinguishing the transplanted donor cells from the endogenous host cells and tracing the donor cells over time. The zebrafish has emerged as an excellent model organism for performing transplantation assays, thanks in part to the transparency of embryos and even adults when pigment mutants are employed. Using transgenic techniques and fast-evolving imaging technology, fluorescence-labeled donor cells can be readily identified and studied during development in vivo. In this chapter, we will discuss the rationale of different types of zebrafish transplantation in both embryos and adults and then focus on four detailed methods of transplantation: blastula/gastrula transplantation for mosaic analysis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemical screening using a transplantation model, and tumor transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
During development, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region through a process of multi-step maturation and expansion. While proliferation of adult HSCs is implicated in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, very little is known about the proliferation status of nascent HSCs in the AGM region. Using Fucci reporter mice that enable in vivo visualization of cell-cycle status, we detect increased proliferation during pre-HSC expansion followed by a slowing down of cycling once cells start to acquire a definitive HSC state, similar to fetal liver HSCs. We observe time-specific changes in intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters corresponding to HSC maturation stages. The proliferative architecture of the clusters is maintained in an orderly anatomical manner with slowly cycling cells at the base and more actively proliferating cells at the more apical part of the cluster, which correlates with c-KIT expression levels, thus providing an anatomical basis for the role of SCF in HSC maturation.

Abstract: Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the expression changes of LOX (lysyl oxidase) family genes, VEGFA, and VEGFB under hypoxic conditions in a co-culture system of ASCs (adipose-derived stromal cells) and ECs (endothelial cells).
Materials and methods
ASCs and ECs were co-cultured under hypoxic and normal oxygen conditions in a 1:1 ratio, and the formation of vessel-like was detected at 7 days. The transwell co-culture system was used and cell lysates were collected at 7 days after co-culture in hypoxic and normal oxygen condition. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to quantify the mRNA expression of VEGFA, VEGFB, and the LOX genes (LOX, LOXL-1, LOXL-2, LOXL-3, and LOXL-4). Expression changes were determined by densitomery.
Results
Enhanced angiogenesis was detected in the co-culture of ASCs and ECs under hypoxic conditions. Among the genes screened, VEGFA, VEGFB, LOXL-1, and LOXL-3 in ECs, both mono-cultured and co-cultured, were significantly enhanced after culturing under hypoxic conditions. In ASCs, VEGFB, LOXL-1, and LOXL-3 were upregulated.
Conclusions
Contact co-culture between ASCs and ECs promotes angiogenesis under hypoxia. LOXL-1 and LOXL-3 expressions were increased in both ASCs and ECs and might play important roles in the enhanced angiogenesis promoted by hypoxia.

Abstract: It has been generally accepted that alternatively activated macrophages (M2), which can be induced by type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, is responsible for tissue repair. However, the function of JNK in IL-4-induced M2 macrophage polarization remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that M0 macrophages can be polarized into M2 status in response to IL-4 stimulation with the increased expression of the M2-specific molecular markers. We also found that IL-4 induced higher expression of JNK and transcription factor c-Myc in M2 macrophages. Our Q-PCR and Western blot results showed that JNK increased the expression of c-Myc and M2 markers Arg1, Mrc1. We also demonstrated c-Myc was the downstream of IL-4-JNK pathway. Further, the depletion of c-Myc, Arg1 and Mrc1 could inhibit the migration ability of M2 macrophages. Taken together, our data establishes a new role for JNK signaling in IL-4-induced alternative activation of macrophages and may provide a novel strategy for immune therapy.

Abstract: Residency at high altitude (HA) demands adaptation to challenging environmental conditions with hypobaric hypoxia being the most important one. Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that chronic exposure to HA reduces cancer mortality and lowers prevalence of metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity implying that adaption to HA modifies a broad spectrum of physiological, metabolic and cellular programs with a generally beneficial outcome for humans. However, the complexity of multiple, potentially tumor-suppressive pathways at HA impedes the understanding of mechanisms leading to reduced cancer mortality. Many adaptive processes at HA are tightly interconnected and thus it cannot be ruled out that the entirety or at least some of the HA-related alterations act in concert to reduce cancer mortality. In this review we discuss tumor formation as a concept of competition between healthy and cancer cells with improved fitness – and therefore higher competitiveness – of healthy cells at high altitude. We discuss HA-related changes in glucose, lipid and iron metabolism that may have an impact on tumorigenesis. Additionally, we discuss two parameters with a strong impact on tumorigenesis, namely drug metabolism and physical activity, to underpin their potential contribution to HA-dependent reduced cancer mortality. Future studies are needed to unravel why cancer mortality is reduced at HA and how this knowledge might be used to prevent and to treat cancer patients.

Abstract: Mild hypothermia has been proven to be useful to treat brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. The present study was undertaken to determine whether mild hypothermia protects hippocampal neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion(OGD/R)-induced injury via improving lysosomal function and autophagic flux. The results showed that OGD/R induced the occurrence of autophagy, while the acidic environment inside the lysosomes was altered. The autophagic flux assay with RFP-GFP tf-LC3 was impeded in hippocampal neurons after OGD/R. Mild hypothermia recovered the lysosomal acidic fluorescence and the lysosomal marker protein expression of LAMP2, which decreased after OGD/R.Furthermore, we found that mild hypothermia up-regulated autophagic flux and promoted the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes in hippocampal neurons following OGD/R injury, but could be reversed by treatment with chloroquine, which acts as a lysosome inhibitor. We also found that mild hypothermia improved mitochondrial autophagy in hippocampal neurons following OGD/R injury. Finally,we found that chloroquine blocked the protective effects of mild hypothermia against OGD/R-induced cell death and injury. Taken together, the present study indicates that mild hypothermia protects hippocampal neurons against OGD/R-induced injury by improving lysosomal function and autophagic flux.

Abstract: Traumatic spinal cord injury is characterized by an initial cell loss that is followed by a concerted cellular response in an attempt to restore the damaged tissue. Nevertheless, little is known about the signaling mechanisms governing the cellular response to injury. Here, we have established an adult ex vivo system that exhibits multiple hallmarks of spinal cord injury and allows the study of complex processes that are difficult to address using animal models. We have characterized the ependymal cell response to injury in this model system and found that ependymal cells can become activated, proliferate, migrate out of the central canal lining and differentiate in a manner resembling the in vivo situation. Moreover, we show that these cells respond to external adenosine triphosphate and exhibit spontaneous Ca2+ activity, processes that may play a significant role in the regulation of their response to spinal cord injury. This model provides an attractive tool to deepen our understanding of the ependymal cell response after spinal cord injury, which may contribute to the development of new treatment options for spinal cord injury.

Abstract: The physical attributes of the zebrafish, including optical transparency during embryogenesis, large clutch sizes, external development, and rapid organogenesis were features that initially attracted developmental biologists to use this vertebrate as an experimental model system. With the progressive development of an extensive genetic “tool kit” and an ever-growing number of transgenic reporter lines, the zebrafish model has evolved into an informative system in which to mimic and study aspects of human disease, including those associated with bacterial infections. This chapter provides detailed protocols for microinjection of bacterial strains into zebrafish larvae and subsequent experiments to investigate single-larva bacterial burdens, live imaging of specific neutrophil and macrophage bactericidal functions, and how these protocols may be applied to drug discovery approaches to uncover novel immunomodulatory drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent labeling of amino acids in proteins by reactive small molecules, in particular at cysteine SH and lysine NH groups, is a powerful approach to identify and characterize proteins and their functions. However, for the less-reactive carboxylic acids present in Asp and Glu, hardly any methodology is available. Employing the lipoprotein binding chaperone PDE6δ as an example, we demonstrate that incorporation of isoxazolium salts that resemble the structure and reactivity of Woodward's reagent K into protein ligands provides a novel method for selective covalent targeting of binding site carboxylic acids in whole proteomes. Covalent adduct formation occurs via rapid formation of enol esters and the covalent bond is stable even in the presence of strong nucleophiles. This new method promises to open up hitherto unexplored opportunities for chemical biology research.

Abstract: Summary
Transition from symmetric to asymmetric cell division requires precise coordination of differential gene expression. We show that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) mainly express DIDO3 and that their differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal requires DIDO1 expression. C-terminal truncation of DIDO3 (Dido3ΔCT) impedes ESC differentiation while retaining self-renewal; small hairpin RNA-Dido1 ESCs have the same phenotype. Dido3ΔCT ESC differentiation is rescued by ectopic expression of DIDO3, which binds the Dido locus via H3K4me3 and RNA POL II and induces DIDO1 expression. DIDO1, which is exported to cytoplasm, associates with, and is N-terminally phosphorylated by PKCiota. It binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2, which contributes to cell fate by OCT4 degradation, to allow expression of primitive endoderm (PE) markers. PE formation also depends on phosphorylated DIDO3 localization to centrosomes, which ensures their correct positioning for PE cell polarization. We propose that DIDO isoforms act as a switchboard that regulates genetic programs for ESC transition from pluripotency maintenance to promotion of differentiation.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and irreversible lung disease. Studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in the development of IPF. The NLRP3 inflammasome is reported to be activated and play an important role in many respiratory diseases. However, whether the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in alveolar epithelial cells as well as the regulatory role of NLRP3 in EMT have not been reported. In this study, we transfected NLRP3 siRNA into A549 and RLE-6TN cells and treated them with bleomycin (BLM) for 24h. Then, we detected the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins, EMT-related proteins and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) via western blotting, immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR. The mRNA and protein level of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 increased after treatment with BLM. The IL-1β levels were significantly decreased after inhibition of NLRP3 and caspase-1. E-cadherin expression increased and α-SMA was reduced in the BLM group when inhibited by NLRP3. The level of TGF-β1 was reduced after NLRP3 silencing. These results indicated that the NLRP3 inflammasome was activated in alveolar epithelial cells and that NLRP3 may regulate EMT through TGF-β1. These results may extend our understanding of the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis and provide a new therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) contribute to myocardial repair after myocardial infarction (MI) by secreting a panel of growth factors and cytokines. This study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of the nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (NUCKS) in regulation of the profiles of BM-MSCs secretion and compare the therapeutic efficacy of NUCKS-/-- and wide type-BM-MSCs (WT-BM-MSCs) on MI. The secretion profiles between NUCKS-/-- and WT-BM-MSCs under hypoxia (1%O2) were analyzed. Gene function analysis showed that compared with WT-BM-MSCs-conditioned medium (CdM), some genes over-presented in NUCKS-/--BM-MSCs-CdM were closely associated with inflammatory response, regulation of cell proliferation, death, migration and secretion. Notably, VEGFa in NUCKS-/--BM-MSCs-CdM was higher than that of WT-BM-MSCs-CdM. WT-BM-MSCs and NUCKS-/--BM-MSCs were transplanted into the peri-infarct region in mice of MI. At 4 weeks after cell transplantation, NUCKS-/-- or WT-BM-MSCs group significantly improved heart function and vessels density and reduced infarction size and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, NUCKS-/--BM-MSCs provided better cardioprotective effects than WT-BM-MSCs against MI. Our study demonstrates that depletion of NUCKS enhances the therapeutic efficacy of BM-MSCs for MI via regulating the secretion.

Abstract: Fast-acting temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations are powerful conditional tools for studying transient cellular processes such as cytokinesis. Fast-acting ts cytokinesis-defective mutants are functional at the permissive temperature; yet show a fully penetrant loss-of-function cytokinesis failure phenotype when upshifted to the restrictive temperature. Fast-acting ts mutations thus allow functional tunability and rapid and reversible protein inactivation by simply shifting the temperature at precise times throughout cell division. In this chapter, we describe several techniques and discuss various approaches for harnessing the power of fast-acting ts mutants to study cytokinesis in Caenorhabditis elegans using both simple passive heat transfer and more advanced fluidic-based thermal control systems. We also provide detailed protocols for standard dissection, mounting, and imaging of early worm embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Ex vivo gene therapy based on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has shown promising results in clinical trials, but genetic engineering to high levels and in large scale remains challenging. We devised a sorting strategy that captures more than 90% of HSC activity in less than 10% of mobilized peripheral blood (mPB) CD34+ cells, and modeled a transplantation protocol based on highly purified, genetically engineered HSCs co-infused with uncultured progenitor cells. Prostaglandin E2 stimulation allowed near-complete transduction of HSCs with lentiviral vectors during a culture time of less than 38 hr, mitigating the negative impact of standard culture on progenitor cell function. Exploiting the pyrimidoindole derivative UM171, we show that transduced mPB CD34+CD38− cells with repopulating potential could be expanded ex vivo. Implementing these findings in clinical gene therapy protocols will improve the efficacy, safety, and sustainability of gene therapy and generate new opportunities in the field of gene editing.

Abstract: Mutations in the small heat shock protein chaperone CRYAB (αB-crystallin/HSPB5) and the intermediate filament protein desmin, phenocopy each other causing cardiomyopathies. Whilst the binding sites for desmin on CRYAB have been determined, desmin epitopes responsible for CRYAB binding and also the parameters that determine CRYAB binding to desmin filaments are unknown. Using a combination of co-sedimentation centrifugation, viscometric assays and electron microscopy of negatively stained filaments to analyse the in vitro assembly of desmin filaments, we show that the binding of CRYAB to desmin is subject to its assembly status, to the subunit organization within filaments formed and to the integrity of the C-terminal tail domain of desmin. Our in vitro studies using a rapid assembly protocol, C-terminally truncated desmin and two disease-causing mutants (I451M and R454W) suggest that CRYAB is a sensor for the surface topology of the desmin filament. Our data also suggest that CRYAB performs an assembly chaperone role because the assembling filaments have different CRYAB-binding properties during the maturation process. We suggest that the capability of CRYAB to distinguish between filaments with different surface topologies due either to mutation (R454W) or assembly protocol is important to understanding the pathomechanism(s) of desmin-CRYAB myopathies.

Abstract: Using primary cultures of normal human prostate epithelial cells, we developed a novel prostasphere-based, label-retention assay that permits identification and isolation of stem cells at a single cell level. Their bona fide stem cell nature was corroborated using in vitro and in vivo regenerative assays and documentation of symmetric/asymmetric division. Robust WNT10B and KRT13 levels without E-cadherin or KRT14 staining distinguished individual stem cells from daughter progenitors in spheroids. Following FACS to isolate label-retaining stem cells from label-free progenitors, RNA-seq identified unique gene signatures for the separate populations which may serve as useful biomarkers. Knockdown of KRT13 or PRAC1 reduced sphere formation and symmetric self-renewal highlighting their role in stem cell maintenance. Pathways analysis identified ribosome biogenesis and membrane estrogen-receptor signaling enriched in stem cells with NF-ĸB signaling enriched in progenitors; activities that were biologically confirmed. Further, bioassays identified heightened autophagy flux and reduced metabolism in stem cells relative to progenitors. These approaches similarly identified stem-like cells from prostate cancer specimens and prostate, breast and colon cancer cell lines suggesting wide applicability. Together, the present studies isolate and identify unique characteristics of normal human prostate stem cells and uncover processes that maintain stem cell homeostasis in the prostate gland.

Abstract: There have been paradoxical findings regarding the expression of DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and its role in predicting prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here we show that DEPTOR expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues and predicted good survival in early stage ESCC patients but not in advanced stage patients. In vitro，our studies showed that ESCC cell lines could be classified into relatively high and low DEPTOR-expressing subgroups according to esophageal squamous epithelial cell line Het-1A.In our study, different levels of DEPTOR expression absolutely determined the response to chemotherapy. In relatively low-expressing cell lines, DEPTOR increased chemotherapy sensitivity via deactivation of the AKT pathway. In relatively high-expressing cell lines, DEPTOR increased cell survival and chemoresistance by strong feedback activation of the IRS1-PI3K-AKT-survivin pathway that occurred after downregulation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K). Collectively, our findings highlight the dichotomous nature of DEPTOR functions in modulating chemotherapy sensitivity in different ESCC cells.
