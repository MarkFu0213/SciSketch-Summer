Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play key roles in developmental epigenetic regulation. Yet the mechanisms that target PRCs to specific loci in mammalian cells remain incompletely understood. In this study we show that Bmi1, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), binds directly to the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex. Genome-wide studies in megakaryocytic cells demonstrate significant chromatin occupancy overlap between the PRC1 core component Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ and functional regulation of a considerable fraction of commonly bound genes. Bmi1/Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ deficiencies generate partial phenocopies of one another in vivo. We also show that Ring1b occupies key Runx1 binding sites in primary murine thymocytes and that this occurs via PRC2-independent mechanisms. Genetic depletion of Runx1 results in reduced Ring1b binding at these sites in vivo. These findings provide evidence for site-specific PRC1 chromatin recruitment by core binding transcription factors in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) are a diverse population that commonly causes respiratory allergies in humans. Chironomid larvae can be used to indicate freshwater pollution, but accurate identification on the basis of morphological characteristics is difficult. In this study, we constructed a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)-based DNA barcode library for Korean chironomids. This library consists of 211 specimens from 49 species, including adults and unidentified larvae. The interspecies and intraspecies COI sequence variations were analyzed. Sophisticated indexes were developed in order to properly evaluate indistinct barcode gaps that are created by insufficient sampling on both the interspecies and intraspecies levels and by variable mutation rates across taxa. In a variety of insect datasets, these indexes were useful for re-evaluating large barcode datasets and for defining COI barcode gaps. The COI-based DNA barcode library will provide a rapid and reliable tool for the molecular identification of Korean chironomid species. Furthermore, this reverse-taxonomic approach will be improved by the continuous addition of other speceis’ sequences to the library.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β members are of key importance during embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Smad7 is a potent antagonist of TGF-β family/Smad-mediated responses, but the regulation of Smad7 activity is not well understood. We identified the RING domain-containing E3 ligase RNF12 as a critical component of TGF-β signaling. Depletion of RNF12 dramatically reduced TGF-β/Smad-induced effects in mammalian cells, whereas ectopic expression of RNF12 strongly enhanced these responses. RNF12 specifically binds to Smad7 and induces its polyubiquitination and degradation. Smad7 levels were increased in RNF12-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, resulting in mitigation of both BMP-mediated repression of neural induction and activin-induced anterior mesoderm formation. RNF12 also antagonized Smad7 during Nodal-dependent and BMP-dependent signaling and morphogenic events in early zebrafish embryos. The gastrulation defects induced by ectopic and depleted Smad7 were rescued in part by RNF12 gain and loss of function, respectively. These findings demonstrate that RNF12 plays a critical role in TGF-β family signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Stochasticity is a hallmark of cellular processes, and different classes of genes show large differences in their cell-to-cell variability (noise). To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated “noise regulons” operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems.

Abstract: Summary
Because MYC plays a causal role in many human cancers, including those with hypoxic and nutrient-poor tumor microenvironments, we have determined the metabolic responses of a MYC-inducible human Burkitt lymphoma model P493 cell line to aerobic and hypoxic conditions, and to glucose deprivation, using stable isotope-resolved metabolomics. Using [U-13C]-glucose as the tracer, both glucose consumption and lactate production were increased by MYC expression and hypoxia. Using [U-13C,15N]-glutamine as the tracer, glutamine import and metabolism through the TCA cycle persisted under hypoxia, and glutamine contributed significantly to citrate carbons. Under glucose deprivation, glutamine-derived fumarate, malate, and citrate were significantly increased. Their 13C-labeling patterns demonstrate an alternative energy-generating glutaminolysis pathway involving a glucose-independent TCA cycle. The essential role of glutamine metabolism in cell survival and proliferation under hypoxia and glucose deficiency makes them susceptible to the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES and hence could be targeted for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Background
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a tremendous resource for cell therapies and the study of human development; however to maintain their undifferentiated state in vitro they routinely require the use of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder-layers and exogenous protein media supplementation.
Results
These well established requirements can be overcome and in this study, it will be demonstrated that phenotypic stability of hESCs can be maintained using a novel, human plasma protein-based hydrogel as an extracellular culture matrix without the use of feeder cell co-culture. hESCs were resuspended in human platelet poor plasma (PPP), which was gelled by the addition of calcium containing DMEM-based hESC culture medium. Phenotypic and genomic expression of the pluripotency markers OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 were measured using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR respectively. Typical hESC morphology was demonstrated throughout in vitro culture and both viability and phenotypic stability were maintained throughout extended culture, up to 25 passages.
Conclusions
PPP-derived hydrogel has demonstrated to be an efficacious alternative to MEF co-culture with its hydrophilicity allowing for this substrate to be delivered via minimally invasive procedures in a liquid phase with polymerization ensuing in situ. Together this provides a novel technique for the study of this unique group of stem cells in either 2D or 3D both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The attachment of the SUMO modifier to proteins controls cellular signaling pathways through noncovalent binding to SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs). Canonical SIMs contain a core of hydrophobic residues that bind to a hydrophobic pocket on SUMO. Negatively charged residues of SIMs frequently contribute to binding by interacting with a basic surface on SUMO. Here we define acetylation within this basic interface as a central mechanism for the control of SUMO-mediated interactions. The acetyl-mediated neutralization of basic charges on SUMO prevents binding to SIMs in PML, Daxx, and PIAS family members but does not affect the interaction between RanBP2 and SUMO. Acetylation is controlled by HDACs and attenuates SUMO- and PIAS-mediated gene silencing. Moreover, it affects the assembly of PML nuclear bodies and restrains the recruitment of the corepressor Daxx to these structures. This acetyl-dependent switch thus expands the regulatory repertoire of SUMO signaling and determines the selectivity and dynamics of SUMO-SIM interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs target invaders for silencing in the CRISPR-Cas pathways that protect bacteria and archaea from viruses and plasmids. The CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) contain sequence elements acquired from invaders that guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins back to the complementary invading DNA or RNA. Here, we have analyzed essential features of the crRNAs associated with the Cas RAMP module (Cmr) effector complex, which cleaves targeted RNAs. We show that Cmr crRNAs contain an 8 nucleotide 5′ sequence tag (also found on crRNAs associated with other CRISPR-Cas pathways) that is critical for crRNA function and can be used to engineer crRNAs that direct cleavage of novel targets. We also present data that indicate that the Cmr complex cleaves an endogenous complementary RNA in Pyrococcus furiosus, providing direct in vivo evidence of RNA targeting by the CRISPR-Cas system. Our findings indicate that the CRISPR RNA-Cmr protein pathway may be exploited to cleave RNAs of interest.

Abstract: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a plant bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial blight (BB) disease, resulting in serious production losses of rice. The crystal structure of malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (XoMCAT), encoded by the gene fabD (Xoo0880) from Xoo, was determined at 2.3 Å resolution in complex with N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethansulfonic acid. Malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase transfers malonyl group from malonyl CoA to acyl carrier protein (ACP). The transacylation step is essential in fatty acid synthesis. Based on the rationale, XoMCAT has been considered as a target for antibacterial agents against BB. Protein-protein interaction between XoMCAT and ACP was also extensively investigated using computational docking, and the proposed model revealed that ACP bound to the cleft between two XoMCAT subdomains.

Abstract: Summary
During development, directional cell division is a major mechanism for establishing the orientation of tissue growth. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo asymmetric divisions perpendicular to the overlying epithelium to produce descendant neurons on the opposite side, thereby orienting initial neural tissue growth. However, the mechanism remains elusive. We provide genetic evidence that extrinsic GPCR signaling determines the orientation of cortical polarity underlying asymmetric divisions of neuroblasts relative to the epithelium. The GPCR Tre1 activates the G protein oα subunit in neuroblasts by interacting with the epithelium to recruit Pins, which regulates spindle orientation. Because Pins associates with the Par-complex via Inscuteable, Tre1 consequently recruits the polarity complex to orthogonally orient the polarity axis to the epithelium. Given the universal role of the Par complex in cellular polarization, we propose that the GPCR-Pins system is a comprehensive mechanism controlling tissue polarity by orienting polarized stem cells and their divisions.

Abstract: Summary
A canonical quantitative view of transcriptional regulation holds that the only role of operator sequence is to set the probability of transcription factor binding, with operator occupancy determining the level of gene expression. In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.

Abstract: MyoD and myogenin (Myog) recognize sets of distinct but overlapping target genes and play different roles in skeletal muscle differentiation. MyoD is sufficient for near-full expression of early targets, while Myog can only partially enhance expression of MyoD-initiated late muscle genes. However, the way in which Myog enhances the expression of MyoD-initiated late muscle genes remains unclear. Here, we examine the effects of Myog on chromatin remodeling at late muscle gene promoters and their activation within chromatin environment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that Myog selectively bound to the regulatory sequences of late muscle genes. Overexpression of Myog was found to overcome sodium butyrate-inhibited chromatin at late muscle genes in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, shifting the transcriptional activation of these genes to an earlier time period. Furthermore, overexpression of Myog led to increased hyperacetylation of core histone H4 in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts but not NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and hyperacetylated H4 was associated directly with the late muscle genes in differentiating C2C12, indicating that Myog can induce chromatin remodeling in the presence of MyoD. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) revealed that Myog was associated with the nuclear protein Brd4 in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. Together, these results suggest that Myog enhances the expression of MyoD-initiated late muscle genes through MyoD-dependent ability of Myog to induce chromatin remodeling, in which Myog-Brd4 interaction may be involved.

Abstract: The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Glomerulosa cells respond to the physiological stimuli, elevated extracellular [K+] and angiotensin II, with an intracellular Ca2+ signal. Cytosolic Ca2+ facilitates the transport of the steroid-precursor cholesterol to mitochondria and, after a few hours, it also induces the transcription of aldosterone synthase. Therefore, the cytosolic Ca2+ signal is regarded as the most important short and long-term mediator of aldosterone secretion. However, cytosolic Ca2+ is also taken up by mitochondria and, in turn, the mitochondrial Ca2+ response activates mitochondrial dehydrogenases resulting in stimulation of respiration and increase in reduced pyridine nucleotides. Since both cholesterol side-chain cleavage and all of the hydroxylation steps of steroid synthesis require NADPH as a cofactor, the importance of cytosolic Ca2+ - mitochondrial Ca2+ coupling and of appropriate NADPH supply in respect to hormone production can be assumed. However, the importance of the mitochondrial factors has been neglected so far. Here, after summarizing earlier findings we provide new results obtained through modifying mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by knocking down p38 MAPK or OPA1 and overexpressing S100G, supporting the notion that mitochondrial Ca2+ and reduced pyridine nucleotides are facilitating factors for both basal and stimulated steroid production.

Abstract: The molecular machinery underlying action potential-evoked, synchronous neurotransmitter release, has been intensely studied. It was presumed that two other forms of exocytosis, delayed (asynchronous) and spontaneous transmission, were mediated by the same voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs), intracellular Ca2+ sensors and vesicle pools. However, a recent explosion in the study of spontaneous and asynchronous release has shown these presumptions to be incorrect. Furthermore, the finding that different forms of synaptic transmission may mediate distinct physiological functions emphasizes the importance of identifying the mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates spontaneous and asynchronous release. In this article, we will briefly summarize new and published data on the role of Ca2+ in regulating spontaneous and asynchronous release at a number of different synapses. We will discuss how an increase of extracellular [Ca2+] increases spontaneous and asynchronous release, show that VACCs are involved at only some synapses, and identify regulatory roles for other ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors. In particular, we will focus on two novel pathways that play important roles in the regulation of non-synchronous release at two exemplary synapses: one modulated by the Ca2+-sensing receptor and the other by transient receptor potential cation channel sub-family V member 1.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are routinely treated with cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin. Through a genome-wide siRNA-based screen, we identified vitamin B6 metabolism as a central regulator of cisplatin responses in vitro and in vivo. By aggravating a bioenergetic catastrophe that involves the depletion of intracellular glutathione, vitamin B6 exacerbates cisplatin-mediated DNA damage, thus sensitizing a large panel of cancer cell lines to apoptosis. Moreover, vitamin B6 sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induction by distinct types of physical and chemical stress, including multiple chemotherapeutics. This effect requires pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), the enzyme that generates the bioactive form of vitamin B6. In line with a general role of vitamin B6 in stress responses, low PDXK expression levels were found to be associated with poor disease outcome in two independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC. These results indicate that PDXK expression levels constitute a biomarker for risk stratification among patients with NSCLC.

Abstract: In various cell types, depletion of intracellular Ca2+-stores results in store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) across the cellular membrane. However, the effects of SOCE on neuronal membrane excitability and mitochondrial functions in central neurons are not well defined. We investigated such cellular downstream effects in pyramidal neurons of rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures by applying electrophysiological and fluorescence imaging techniques. We report that SOCE is associated with (i) elevations of Ca2+-concentration in individual neuronal mitochondria ([Ca2+]m). In addition, SOCE can result in (ii) hyperpolarizing neuronal membrane currents, (iii) increase in extracellular K+-concentration ([K+]o), (iv) mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and (v) changes in intracellular redox state (NAD(P)H and FAD fluorescence), the latter reflecting responses of energy metabolism. These additional downstream effects of SOCE required concomitant muscarinic receptor activation by carbachol or acetylcholine, and were suppressed by agonist washout or application of antagonist, atropine. We conclude that muscarinic receptor activation determines the downstream effects of SOCE on neuronal membrane excitability and energy metabolism. This mechanism might have significant impact on information processing and neurometabolic coupling in central neurons.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to debilitating cognitive deficits. Recent evidence demonstrates that glutamate receptors are dysregulated by amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) oligomers, resulting in disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission which parallels early cognitive deficits. Although it is well accepted that neuronal death in AD is related to disturbed intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) homeostasis, little is known about the contribution of NMDARs containing GluN2A or GluN2B subunits on Aβ-induced Ca2+i rise and neuronal dysfunction. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the role of NMDAR subunits in dysregulation of Ca2+i homeostasis induced by Aβ 1–42 preparation containing both oligomers (in higher percentage) and monomers in rat cerebral cortical neurons. The involvement of NMDARs was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition with MK-801 or the selective GluN2A and GLUN2B subunit antagonists NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil, respectively. We show that Aβ, like NMDA, increase Ca2+i levels mainly through activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B subunits. Conversely, GluN2A-NMDARs antagonism potentiates Ca2+i rise induced by a high concentration of Aβ (1μM), suggesting that GluN2A and GluN2B subunits have opposite roles in regulating Ca2+i homeostasis. Moreover, Aβ modulate NMDA-induced responses and vice versa. Indeed, pre-exposure to Aβ (1μM) decrease NMDA-evoked Ca2+I rise and pre-exposure to NMDA decrease Aβ response. Interestingly, simultaneous addition of Aβ and NMDA potentiate Ca2+I levels, this effect being regulated by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in opposite manners. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of early AD pathogenesis, by exploring the role of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in the mechanism of Aβ toxicity in AD.

Abstract: AK007836 encodes a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) consisting of 2 exons. Since AK007836 is located just upstream of Pcna and transcribed in the opposite direction to that of Pcna, we analyzed its expression pattern. Both ncRNA and Pcna expressions were detected in in vitro and in vivo cells, showing a positive correlation. A 177 bp region separating the first exons of Pcna and AK007836 has a bidirectional promoter activity. When the expression of ncRNA was reduced by siRNA, Pcna expression was also reduced in normal cells, but not in cancer cells. These results suggest that the ncRNA is divergently transcribed from the bidirectional promoter, positively regulating the neighboring protein-coding Pcna gene transcription, and this regulatory function is somehow disrupted in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidation of lipid substrates is essential for survival in fasting and other catabolic conditions, sparing glucose for the brain and other glucose-dependent tissues. Here we show Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 (SRC-3) plays a central role in long chain fatty acid metabolism by directly regulating carnitine/acyl-carnitine translocase (CACT) gene expression. Genetic deficiency of CACT in humans is accompanied by a constellation of metabolic and toxicity phenotypes including hypoketonemia, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and impaired neurologic, cardiac and skeletal muscle performance, each of which is apparent in mice lacking SRC-3 expression. Consistent with human cases of CACT deficiency, dietary rescue with short chain fatty acids drastically attenuates the clinical hallmarks of the disease in mice devoid of SRC-3. Collectively, our results position SRC-3 as a key regulator of β-oxidation. Moreover, these findings allow us to consider platform coactivators such as the SRCs as potential contributors to syndromes such as CACT deficiency, previously considered as monogenic.

Abstract: Summary
During prometaphase, dense microtubule nucleation sites at centrosomes form robust spindles that align chromosomes promptly. Failure of centrosome maturation leaves chromosomes scattered, as seen routinely in cancer cells, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We previously reported that the Miki (LOC253012) gene is frequently deleted in MDS patients, and that low levels of Miki are associated with abnormal mitosis. Here we demonstrate that Miki localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by tankyrase-1 during late G2 and prophase. PARsylated Miki then translocates to mitotic centrosomes and anchors CG-NAP, a large scaffold protein of the γ-tubulin ring complex. Due to impairment of microtubule aster formation, cells in which tankyrase-1, Miki, or CG-NAP expression is downregulated all show prometaphase disturbances, including scattered and lagging chromosomes. Our data suggest that PARsylation of Miki by tankyrase-1 is a key initial event promoting prometaphase.

Abstract: Summary
Ars2 is a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex that contributes to microRNA biogenesis and is required for cellular proliferation. Here, we expand on the repertoire of Ars2-dependent microRNAs and determine that Ars2 regulates a number of mRNAs, the largest defined subset of which code for histones. Histone mRNAs are unique among mammalian mRNAs because they are not normally polyadenylated but, rather, are cleaved following a 3′ stem loop. A significant reduction in correctly processed histone mRNAs was observed following Ars2 depletion, concurrent with an increase in polyadenylated histone transcripts. Furthermore, Ars2 physically associated with histone mRNAs and the noncoding RNA 7SK. Knockdown of 7SK led to an enhanced ratio of cleaved to polyadenylated histone transcripts, an effect dependent on Ars2. Together, the data demonstrate that Ars2 contributes to histone mRNA 3′ end formation and expression and these functional properties of Ars2 are negatively regulated by interaction with 7SK RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Sound is detected and converted into electrical signals within the ear. The cochlea not only acts as a passive detector of sound, however, but can also produce tones itself. These otoacoustic emissions are a striking manifestation of the cochlea's mechanical active process. A controversy remains of how these mechanical signals propagate back to the middle ear, from which they are emitted as sound. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental studies to show that mechanical signals can be transmitted by waves on Reissner's membrane, an elastic structure within the cochlea. We develop a theory for wave propagation on Reissner's membrane and its role in otoacoustic emissions. Employing a scanning laser interferometer, we measure traveling waves on Reissner's membrane in the gerbil, guinea pig, and chinchilla. The results are in accord with the theory and thus support a role for Reissner's membrane in otoacoustic emissions.

Abstract: Epigenetic methylation change is a major process that occurs during cancer development. Even though many tumor-related genes have been identified based on their relationship between methylation and expression, few studies have been conducted to investigate the relevant biological pathways involved in these changes. To identify essential pathways likely to be affected by methylation in breast cancer, we examined a pool of genes in which expression was upregulated after induction of demethylation by 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (Aza) in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Genome-wide demethylation was confirmed by monitoring the demethylation of a previously known gene, SULT1A1. Overall, 210 and 213 genes were found to be upregulated and downregulated (fold change > 2), respectively, in common in cells treated with 5 and 10 μM of Aza. Network analysis of these 423 genes with altered expression patterns identified the involvement of a cancer related network of genes that were heavily regulated by TNF-α in breast tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation of cellular processes relevant to TNF-α-dependent apoptosis may be intimately involved in tumorigenesis in MCF-7 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal inflammatory signaling activation occurs commonly in cancer cells. However, how it is initiated and maintained and its roles in early stages of tumorigensis are largely unknown. Here, we report that the monocyte-derived MCP-1-induced transformation of immortal breast epithelial cells is triggered by transient activation of MEK/ERK and IKK/NF-κB pathways and maintained by constitutive activation of a feed-forward inflammatory signaling circuit composed of miR-200c, p65, JNK2, HSF1, and IL6. Suppression of miR-200c by IL6 constitutively activates p65/RelA and JNK2, and the latter phosphorylates and activates HSF1. In turn, HSF1 triggers demethylation of the IL6 promoter that facilitates the binding of p65 and c-Jun, which together drive constitutive IL6 transcription. Importantly, this signaling circuit is manifest in human cancer cells and in a mouse model of ErbB2-driven breast cancer, where IL6 loss significantly impairs tumorigenesis. Therefore, targeting this signaling circuit represents an effective therapeutic avenue for breast cancer prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitylation entails the concerted action of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. We recently reported that OTUB1, a deubiquitylase, inhibits the DNA damage response independently of its isopeptidase activity. OTUB1 does so by blocking ubiquitin transfer by UBC13, the cognate E2 enzyme for RNF168. OTUB1 also inhibits E2s of the UBE2D and UBE2E families. Here we elucidate the structural mechanism by which OTUB1 binds E2s to inhibit ubiquitin transfer. OTUB1 recognizes ubiquitin-charged E2s through contacts with both donor ubiquitin and the E2 enzyme. Surprisingly, free ubiquitin associates with the canonical distal ubiquitin-binding site on OTUB1 to promote formation of the inhibited E2 complex. Lys48 of donor ubiquitin lies near the OTUB1 catalytic site and the C terminus of free ubiquitin, a configuration that mimics the products of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chain cleavage. OTUB1 therefore co-opts Lys48-linked ubiquitin chain recognition to suppress ubiquitin conjugation and the DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
Bim is a proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. In response to death stimuli, Bim dissociates from the dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1/LC8), where it is inactive, and can then initiate Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. We found that Bim depletion increases autophagosome synthesis in cells and in vivo, and this effect is inhibited by overexpression of cell death-deficient Bim. Bim inhibits autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1, an autophagy regulator, and this interaction is facilitated by LC8. Bim bridges the Beclin 1-LC8 interaction and thereby inhibits autophagy by mislocalizing Beclin 1 to the dynein motor complex. Starvation, an autophagic stimulus, induces Bim phosphorylation, which abrogates LC8 binding to Bim, leading to dissociation of Bim and Beclin 1. Our data suggest that Bim switches locations between apoptosis-inactive/autophagy-inhibitory and apoptosis-active/autophagy-permissive sites.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle-dependent expression of canonical histone proteins enables newly synthesized DNA to be integrated into chromatin in replicating cells. However, the molecular basis of cell cycle-dependency in the switching of histone gene regulation remains to be uncovered. Here, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a molecular switcher, HERS (histone gene-specific epigenetic repressor in late S phase), for nucleosomal core histone gene inactivation in Drosophila. HERS protein is phosphorylated by a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) at the end of S-phase. Phosphorylated HERS binds to histone gene regulatory regions and anchors HP1 and Su(var)3-9 to induce chromatin inactivation through histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. These findings illustrate a salient molecular switch linking epigenetic gene silencing to cell cycle-dependent histone production.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion class G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCR) form the second largest group of seven-transmembrane-spanning (7TM) receptors whose molecular layout and function differ from canonical 7TM receptors. Despite their essential roles in immunity, tumorigenesis, and development, the mechanisms of aGPCR activation and signal transduction have remained obscure to date. Here, we use a transgenic assay to define the protein domains required in vivo for the activity of the prototypical aGPCR LAT-1/Latrophilin in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) motif, the molecular hallmark feature of the entire aGPCR class, is essential for LAT-1 signaling serving in two different activity modes of the receptor. Surprisingly, neither mode requires cleavage but presence of the GPS, which relays interactions with at least two different partners. Our work thus uncovers the versatile nature of aGPCR activity in molecular detail and places the GPS motif in a central position for diverse protein-protein interactions.

Abstract: The present study highlighted the aromatic-participant interactions in in vivo trimerization of HSF1 and got an insight into the process of HSF1 protecting against apoptosis. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mutations of mouse HSF1 (W37A, Y60A and F104A) resulted in a loss of trimerization activity, impaired binding of the heat shock element (HSE) and lack of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression after a heat shock. Under UV irradiation, wildtype mouse HSF1 protected the MEFs from UV-induced apoptosis, but none of the mutants offered protection. We found that normal expression of HSF1 was essential to the cell arrest in G2 phase, assisting with the cell cycle checkpoint. The cells that lack normal HSF1 failed to arrest in the G2 phase, resulting in the process of cell apoptosis. We conclude that the treatment with UV or heat shock stresses appears to induce the approach of HSF1 monomers directly via aromatic-participant interactions, followed by the formation of a HSF1 trimer. HSF1 protects the MEFs from the stresses through the expression of HSPs and a G2 cell cycle arrest.

Abstract: Summary
The removal of histone H3 lysine27 (H3K27) trimethylation mark is important for the robust induction of many cell type-specific genes during differentiation. Here we show that UTX, a H3K27 demethylase, acts as a critical switch to promote a cardiac-specific gene program. UTX-deficient ESCs failed to develop heart-like rhythmic contractions under a cardiac differentiation condition. UTX-deficient mice show severe defects in heart development and embryonic lethality. We found that UTX is recruited to cardiac-specific enhancers by associating with core cardiac transcription factors and demethylates H3K27 residues in cardiac genes. In addition, UTX facilitates the recruitment of Brg1 to the cardiac-specific enhancers. Together, our data reveal key roles for UTX in a timely transition from poised to active chromatin in cardiac genes during heart development and a fundamental mechanism by which a H3K27 demethylase triggers tissue-specific chromatin changes.

Abstract: Summary
Recent findings indicate that prevalent human carcinomas overexpress the mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1). Overexpression of IF1 inhibits the synthase activity of the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase and plays a crucial role in metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to enhanced aerobic glycolysis. Herein, we demonstrate that IF1 overexpression in colon cancer cells triggers mitochondrial hyperpolarization and the subsequent production of superoxide radical, a reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are required to promote the transcriptional activation of the NFκB pathway via phosphorylation-dependent IκBα degradation. Activation of NFκB results in a cellular adaptive response that includes proliferation and Bcl-xL mediated resistance to drug-induced cell death. Quenching the mitochondrial production of ROS prevents the activation of NFκB and abolishes the IF1-mediated cellular adaptive response. Overall, our findings provide evidence linking the activity of a mitochondrial protein with retrograde signaling to the nucleus to promote cellular proliferation and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx) are abundant antioxidant enzymes whose thioredoxin peroxidase activity plays an important role in protecting against oxidative stress, aging, and cancer. Paradoxically, this thioredoxin peroxidase activity is highly sensitive to inactivation by peroxide-induced Prx hyperoxidation. However, any possible advantage in preventing Prx from removing peroxides under oxidative stress conditions has remained obscure. Here we demonstrate that, in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, the Prx Tpx1 is a major substrate for thioredoxin in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and, as such, competitively inhibits thioredoxin-mediated reduction of other oxidized proteins. Consequently, we reveal that the hyperoxidation of Tpx1 is critical to allow thioredoxin to act on other substrates ensuring repair of oxidized proteins and cell survival following exposure to toxic levels of hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that the inactivation of the thioredoxin peroxidase activity of Prx is important to maintain thioredoxin activity and cell viability under oxidative stress conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration requires maintenance of adhesive contacts between adjacent cells, coordination of polarized cell protrusions, and generation of propulsive traction forces. We demonstrate that mechanical force applied locally to C-cadherins on single Xenopus mesendoderm cells is sufficient to induce polarized cell protrusion and persistent migration typical of individual cells within a collectively migrating tissue. Local tension on cadherin adhesions induces reorganization of the keratin intermediate filament network toward these stressed sites. Plakoglobin, a member of the catenin family, is localized to cadherin adhesions under tension and is required for both mechanoresponsive cell behavior and assembly of the keratin cytoskeleton at the rear of these cells. Local tugging forces on cadherins occur in vivo through interactions with neighboring cells, and these forces result in coordinate changes in cell protrusive behavior. Thus, cadherin-dependent force-inducible regulation of cell polarity in single mesendoderm cells represents an emergent property of the intact tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control of gene expression plays a key role in many biological processes. Consequently, the activity of the translation apparatus is under tight homeostatic control. eIF4E, the mRNA 5′ cap-binding protein, facilitates cap-dependent translation and is a major target for translational control. eIF4E activity is controlled by a family of repressor proteins, termed 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Here, we describe the surprising finding that despite the importance of eIF4E for translation, a drastic knockdown of eIF4E caused only minor reduction in translation. This conundrum can be explained by the finding that 4E-BP1 is degraded in eIF4E-knockdown cells. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1, which binds to eIF4E, is degraded, whereas hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 is refractory to degradation. We identified the KLHL25-CUL3 complex as the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1. Thus, the activity of eIF4E is under homeostatic control via the regulation of the levels of its repressor protein 4E-BP1 through ubiquitination.

Abstract: Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to systemic metabolic irregularities and obesity-linked metabolic disorders. Orosomucoid (ORM), an acute phase reactant protein, was shown to be produced in response to metabolic and inflammatory signals in the adipose tissue of obese mice, which protects them from severe inflammation and subsequent metabolic dysfunction. In this study, we examined whether there are sitespecific differences between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT and SAT, respectively) ORM gene and protein expression from individuals with a wide range of obesity and the relationship between expressed and circulating ORM levels and measures of adiposity, insulin resistance, and pro- and anti-inflammatory markers and adipokines. The level of circulating ORM correlated positively with BMI, body fat mass, and serum leptin. It also correlated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR values and C-reactive protein in men. There were no site-specific differences in ORM mRNA and protein expression between VAT and SAT, nor did we find a relationship between circulating ORM levels and its mRNA expression in either fat depot. We found that ORM mRNA expression correlated with mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and adiponectin in VAT, and with TNF-α and adiponectin in SAT. These observations are the first description linking adipose tissue ORM and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules in humans. The close links of ORM and measures of adiposity, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue inflammation in humans reinforce previous experimental data and warrant further studies to explore a possible role of ORM in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated metabolic derangements.

Abstract: Summary
Caspase inhibition is a promising approach for treating multiple diseases. Using a reconstituted assay and high-throughput screening, we identified a group of nonpeptide caspase inhibitors. These inhibitors share common chemical scaffolds, suggesting the same mechanism of action. They can inhibit apoptosis in various cell types induced by multiple stimuli; they can also inhibit caspase-1-mediated interleukin generation in macrophages, indicating potential anti-inflammatory application. While these compounds inhibit all the tested caspases, kinetic analysis indicates they do not compete for the catalytic sites of the enzymes. The cocrystal structure of one of these compounds with caspase-7 reveals that it binds to the dimerization interface of the caspase, another common structural element shared by all active caspases. Consistently, biochemical analysis demonstrates that the compound abates caspase-8 dimerization. Based on these kinetic, biochemical, and structural analyses, we suggest that these compounds are allosteric caspase inhibitors that function through binding to the dimerization interface of caspases.

Abstract: Bradykinin (BK) is involved in bone resorption in chronic inflammatory diseases. During bone formation, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+. In osteoblasts, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates transmembrane influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs). Voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels serve as crucial mediators of membrane excitability and many Ca2+-dependent functions, including bone growth, regulation of proliferation, enzyme activity and gene expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BK and 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSCC currents carried by Ba2+ (IBa). Application of 1,25(OH)2D3 facilitated IBa in a voltage-dependent manner. Pretreatment with SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) attenuated 1,25(OH)2D3-induced facilitation of IBa. Bradykinin and BK1 receptor agonist [Lys-des-Arg9]-BK also facilitated IBa. After 24h or 7days exposure to BK, that is, under chronic inflammatory conditions, application of 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited IBa. In addition, pretreatment with PD98,059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuated 1,25(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of IBa. These results indicate that, under normal conditions, 1,25(OH)2D3 acts with adenylate cyclase to facilitate VSCCs, whereas under chronic inflammatory conditions it acts with MAPK to inhibit VSCCs in pre-osteoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular determinants of spleen organogenesis and the etiology of isolated congenital asplenia (ICA), a life-threatening human condition, are unknown. We previously reported that Pbx1 deficiency causes organ growth defects including asplenia. Here, we show that mice with splenic mesenchyme-specific Pbx1 inactivation exhibit hyposplenia. Moreover, the loss of Pbx causes downregulation of Nkx2-5 and derepression of p15Ink4b in spleen mesenchymal progenitors, perturbing the cell cycle. Removal of p15Ink4b in Pbx1 spleen-specific mutants partially rescues spleen growth. By whole-exome sequencing of a multiplex kindred with ICA, we identify a heterozygous missense mutation (P236H) in NKX2-5 showing reduced transactivation in vitro. This study establishes that a Pbx/Nkx2-5/p15 regulatory module is essential for spleen development.

Abstract: Summary
The ATM kinase and p53 are key tumor suppressor factors that control the genotoxic stress response pathway. The ATM substrate Mdm2 controls p53 activity by either targeting p53 for degradation or promoting its synthesis by binding the p53 mRNA. The physiological role and regulation of Mdm2's dual function toward p53 is not known. Here we show that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser395 is required for the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction. This event also promotes SUMO-conjugation of Mdm2 and its nucleoli accumulation. Interfering with the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction prevents p53 stabilization and activation following DNA damage. These results demonstrate how ATM activity switches Mdm2 from a negative to a positive regulator of p53 via the p53 mRNA.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased cardiovascular and liver-related mortality. NAFLD is characterized by both triglyceride and free cholesterol (FC) accumulation without a corresponding increment in cholesterol esters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of cholesterol metabolic genes in NAFLD and relate these to disease phenotype. NAFLD was associated with increased SREBP-2 maturation, HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) expression and decreased phosphorylation of HMGCR. Cholesterol synthesis was increased as measured by the circulating desmosterol:cholesterol ratio. miR-34a, a microRNA increased in NAFLD, inhibited sirtuin-1 with downstream dephosphorylation of AMP kinase and HMGCR. Cholesterol ester hydrolase was increased while ACAT-2 remained unchanged. LDL receptor expression was significantly decreased and similar in NAFLD subjects on or off statins. HMGCR expression was correlated with FC, histologic severity of NAFLD and LDL-cholesterol. These data demonstrate dysregulated cholesterol metabolism in NAFLD which may contribute to disease severity and cardiovascular risks.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation under similar selective pressure often leads to comparable phenotypes. A longstanding question is whether such phenotypic repeatability entails similar (parallelism) or different genotypic changes (convergence). To better understand this, we characterized mutations that optimized expression of a plasmid-borne metabolic pathway during laboratory evolution of a bacterium. Expressing these pathway genes was essential for growth but came with substantial costs. Starting from overexpression, replicate populations founded by this bacterium all evolved to reduce expression. Despite this phenotypic repetitiveness, the underlying mutational spectrum was highly diverse. Analysis of these plasmid mutations identified three distinct means to modulate gene expression: (1) reducing the gene copy number, (2) lowering transcript stability, and (3) integration of the pathway-bearing plasmid into the host genome. Our study revealed diverse molecular changes beneath convergence to a simple phenotype. This complex genotype-phenotype mapping presents a challenge to inferring genetic evolution based solely on phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Voltage gated Ca2+ channels are effective voltage sensors of plasma membrane which convert cell depolarizations into Ca2+ signaling. The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla utilize a large number of Ca2+ channel types to drive the Ca2+-dependent release of catecholamines into blood circulation, during normal or stress-induced conditions. Some of the Ca2+ channels expressed in chromaffin cells (L, N, P/Q, R and T), however, do not control only vesicle fusion and catecholamine release. They also subserve a variety of key activities which are vital for the physiological and pathological functioning of the cell, like: (i) shaping the action potentials of electrical oscillations driven either spontaneously or by ACh stimulation, (ii) controlling the action potential frequency of tonic or bursts firing, (iii) regulating the compensatory and excess endocytosis following robust exocytosis and (iv) driving the remodeling of Ca2+ signaling which occurs during stressors stimulation. Here, we will briefly review the well-established properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels accumulated over the past three decades focusing on the most recent discoveries on the role that L- (Cav1.2, Cav1.3) and T-type (Cav3.2) channels play in the control of excitability, exocytosis and endocytosis of chromaffin cells in normal and stress-mimicking conditions

Abstract: The B cell receptor (BCR)-elicited calcium flux results in activation of mature B cells. We have recently shown that the adaptor protein Swiprosin-1/EFhd2 (EFhd2) amplifies the BCR-induced calcium flux in B cell lines. EFhd2 is a calcium binding adaptor protein with two predicted EF-hands. Here we asked whether these domains are functional and control its function. Using a blot-overlay assay with radioactive calcium we show that both EF-hands of EFhd2 have an intrinsic capacity to bind calcium. Equilibrium centrifugation confirmed that EFhd2 binds 2 calcium ions, with an apparent Kd of 110μM. Point mutations revealed that the conserved residues E116 and E152, which reside in the canonical calcium binding loop in EF-hands 1 and 2, are essential for calcium binding by EFhd2. These mutations as well as deletion of the EF-hands, in particular EF-hand 1, abolished the ability of EFhd2 to restore BCR-induced calcium signaling in EFhd2-deficient WEHI231 cells. N-terminal deletions, but not C-terminal deletions, acted similarly. Thus, the N-terminal part of EFhd2 as well as calcium binding to its EF-hands control the intracellular calcium concentration in response to BCR stimulation in WEHI231 cells. Hence, EFhd2 regulates the BCR-elicited calcium flux through a calcium-dependent positive feedback mechanism in WEHI231 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria play central roles in integrating pro- and antiapoptotic stimuli, and JNK is well known to have roles in activating apoptotic pathways. We establish a critical link between stress-induced JNK activation, mitofusin 2, which is an essential component of the mitochondrial outer membrane fusion apparatus, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). JNK phosphorylation of mitofusin 2 in response to cellular stress leads to recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1/HectH9/E3Histone/Lasu1 to mitofusin 2, with the BH3 domain of Huwe1 implicated in this interaction. This results in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of mitofusin 2, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced apoptotic cell death. The stability of a nonphosphorylatable mitofusin 2 mutant is unaffected by stress and protective against apoptosis. Conversely, a mitofusin 2 phosphomimic is more rapidly degraded without cellular stress. These findings demonstrate how proximal signaling events can influence both mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis through phosphorylation-stimulated degradation of the mitochondrial fusion machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Multidrug transporters are ubiquitous efflux pumps that provide cells with defense against various toxic compounds. In bacteria, which typically harbor numerous multidrug transporter genes, the majority function as secondary multidrug/proton antiporters. Proton-coupled secondary transport is a fundamental process that is not fully understood, largely owing to the obscure nature of proton-transporter interactions. Here we analyzed the substrate/proton coupling mechanism in MdfA, a model multidrug/proton antiporter. By measuring the effect of protons on substrate binding and by directly measuring proton binding and release, we show that substrates and protons compete for binding to MdfA. Our studies strongly suggest that competition is an integral feature of secondary multidrug transport. We identified the proton-binding acidic residue and show that, surprisingly, the substrate binds at a different site. Together, the results suggest an interesting mode of indirect competition as a mechanism of multidrug/proton antiport.

Abstract: Summary
In long-range transport of cargo, prototypical kinesin-1 steps along a single protofilament on the microtubule, an astonishing behavior given the number of theoretically available binding sites on adjacent protofilaments. Using a laser trap assay, we analyzed the trajectories of several representatives from the kinesin-2 class on freely suspended microtubules. In stark contrast to kinesin-1, these motors display a wide range of left-handed spiraling around microtubules and thus generate torque during cargo transport. We provide direct evidence that kinesin's neck region determines the torque-generating properties. A model system based on kinesin-1 corroborates this result: disrupting the stability of the neck by inserting flexible peptide stretches resulted in pronounced left-handed spiraling. Mimicking neck stability by crosslinking significantly reduced the spiraling of the motor up to the point of protofilament tracking. Finally, we present a model that explains the physical basis of kinesin's spiraling around the microtubule.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle atrophy induced by aging (sarcopenia), inactivity, and prolonged fasting states (starvation) is predominantly restricted to glycolytic type II muscle fibers and typical spares oxidative type I fibers. However, the mechanisms accounting for muscle fiber-type specificity of atrophy have remained enigmatic. In the current study, although the Fyn tyrosine kinase activated the mTORC1 signaling complex, it also induced marked atrophy of glycolytic fibers with relatively less effect on oxidative muscle fibers. This was due to inhibition of macroautophagy via an mTORC1-independent but STAT3-dependent reduction in Vps34 protein levels and decreased Vps34/p150/Beclin1/Atg14 complex 1. Physiologically, in the fed state endogenous Fyn kinase activity was increased in glycolytic but not oxidative skeletal muscle. In parallel, Y705-STAT3 phosphorylation increased with decreased Vps34 protein levels. Moreover, fed/starved regulation of Y705-STAT3 phosphorylation and Vps34 protein levels was prevented in skeletal muscle of Fyn null mice. These data demonstrate a Fyn/STAT3/Vps34 pathway that is responsible for fiber-type-specific regulation of macroautophagy and skeletal muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are crucial for neural coding and plasticity. However, little is known about the adaptive function of extrasynaptic NMDARs occurring mainly on dendritic shafts. Here, we find that in CA1 pyramidal neurons, backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) recruit shaft NMDARs exposed to ambient glutamate. In contrast, spine NMDARs are “protected,” under baseline conditions, from such glutamate influences by perisynaptic transporters: we detect bAP-evoked Ca2+ entry through these receptors upon local synaptic or photolytic glutamate release. During theta-burst firing, NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ entry either downregulates or upregulates an h-channel conductance (Gh) of the cell depending on whether synaptic glutamate release is intact or blocked. Thus, the balance between activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs can determine the sign of Gh plasticity. Gh plasticity in turn regulates dendritic input probed by local glutamate uncaging. These results uncover a metaplasticity mechanism potentially important for neural coding and memory formation.

Abstract: Available methods to measure mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M) include both targeted proteins and fluorescent dyes. Targeted proteins usually report much higher [Ca2+]M values than fluorescent dyes, up to two orders of magnitude. However, we show here that the low-Ca2+-affinity dye rhod-5N provides [Ca2+]M values similar to those reported by targeted aequorin, suggesting that the discrepancies are mainly due to the higher Ca2+-affinity of the fluorescent dyes used. We find rhod-5N has an apparent in situ intramitochondrial Kd around 0.5mM. Addition of Ca2+ buffers containing between 4.5 and 10μM [Ca2+] to permeabilized cells loaded with rhod-5N induced increases in calibrated [Ca2+]M up to the 100μM–1mM range, which were dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca2+ release from mitochondria was largely dependent on [Na+]. We have then used rhod-5N loaded cells to investigate the [Ca2+]M response to agonist stimulation at the single-cell and subcellular level. The [Ca2+]M peaks induced by histamine varied by nearly 10-fold among different cells, with a mean about 25μM. In the presence of the Ca2+ uniporter stimulator kaempferol, the [Ca2+]M peaks induced by histamine were also highly variable, and the mean [Ca2+]M peak was 3-fold higher. Simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] peaks showed little correlation among the heights of the peaks in both compartments. Studying the [Ca2+]M peaks at the subcellular level, we found significant heterogeneities among regions in the same cell. In particular, the [Ca2+]M increase in mitochondrial regions close to the nucleus was more than double that of mitochondrial regions far from the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
In this study we examine the mechanisms of dynamic DNA methylation of the p15ink4b tumor suppressor gene. Using conventional ChIP and ChiPseq, we identify the p15ink4b promoter as a target for the ZNF217 oncogene, the CoREST complex, and DNMT3A. Treatment of cells with TGF-β triggers active demethylation involving loss of ZNF217/CoREST/DNMT3A and the corecruitment of SMAD2/3, CBP, and the DNA glycosylase TDG. Knockdown of TDG, or its functional homolog MBD4, prevents TGF-β-dependent demethylation of p15ink4b. DNA immunoprecipitation of 5mC and 5hmC indicates that 5mC undergoes conversion to 5hmC prior to activation of p15ink4b. Remarkably, overexpression of ZNF217 inhibits active demethylation and expression of the p15ink4b gene by preventing recruitment of SMAD2/3 and TDG. These findings suggest that active demethylation is essential for regulating a subset of TGF-β-dependent genes. Importantly, disruption of active demethylation by the ZNF217 oncogene may be a paradigm for other oncogenic signals on DNA methylation dynamics.

Abstract: The concept of stimulus–secretion coupling was born from experiments performed in chromaffin cells 50 years ago. Stimulation of these cells with acetylcholine enhances calcium (Ca2+) entry and this generates a transient elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) that triggers the exocytotic release of catecholamines. The control of the [Ca2+]c signal is complex and depends on various classes of plasmalemmal calcium channels, cytosolic calcium buffers, the uptake and release of Ca2+ from cytoplasmic organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, chromaffin vesicles and the nucleus, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms, such as the plasma membrane Ca2+-stimulated ATPase, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Computation of the rates of Ca2+ fluxes between the different cell compartments support the proposal that the chromaffin cell has developed functional calcium tetrads formed by calcium channels, cytosolic calcium buffers, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria nearby the exocytotic plasmalemmal sites. These tetrads shape the Ca2+ transients occurring during cell activation to regulate early and late steps of exocytosis, and the ensuing endocytotic responses. The different patterns of catecholamine secretion in response to stress may thus depend on such local [Ca2+]c transients occurring at different cell compartments, and generated by redistribution and release of Ca2+ by cytoplasmic organelles. In this manner, the calcium tetrads serve to couple the variable energy demands due to exo–endocytotic activities with energy production and protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
In anaphase, sister chromatids separate abruptly and are then segregated by the mitotic spindle. The protease separase triggers sister separation by cleaving the Scc1/Mcd1 subunit of the cohesin ring that holds sisters together. Polo-kinase phosphorylation of Scc1 promotes its cleavage, but the underlying regulatory circuits are unclear. We developed a separase biosensor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that provides a quantitative indicator of cohesin cleavage in single cells. Separase is abruptly activated and cleaves most cohesin within 1 min, after which anaphase begins. Cohesin near centromeres and telomeres is cleaved at the same rate and time. Protein phosphatase PP2ACdc55 inhibits cohesin cleavage by counteracting polo-kinase phosphorylation of Scc1. In early anaphase, the previously described separase inhibition of PP2ACdc55 promotes cohesin cleavage. Thus, separase acts directly on Scc1 and also indirectly, through inhibition of PP2ACdc55, to stimulate cohesin cleavage, providing a feedforward loop that may contribute to a robust and timely anaphase.

Abstract: Recently, we isolated a subset of glycolipoproteins from Panax ginseng, that we designated gintonin, and demonstrated that it induced [Ca2+]i transients in cells via G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway(s). However, active components responsible for Ca2+ mobilization and the corresponding receptor(s) were unknown. Active component(s) for [Ca2+]i transients of gintonin were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and ion-mobility mass spectrometry, respectively. The corresponding receptor(s) were investigated through gene expression assays. We found that gintonin contains LPA C1S:2 and other LPAs. Proteomic analysis showed that ginseng major latex-like protein and ribonuclease-like storage proteins are protein components of gintonin. Gintonin induced [Ca2+]i transients in B103 rat neuroblastoma cells transfected with human LPA receptors with high affinity in order of LPA2 > LPA5 > LPA1 > LPA3 > LPA4. The LPA1/LPA3 receptor antagonist Ki16425 blocked gintonin action in cells expressing LPA1 or LPA3. Mutations of binding sites in the LPA3 receptor attenuated gintonin action. Gintonin acted via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and -insensitive G protein-phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-Ca2+ pathways. However, gintonin had no effects on other receptors examined. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) gintonin stimulated cell proliferation and migration. Gintonin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. PTX blocked gintonin-mediated migration and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In PC12 cells gintonin induced morphological changes, which were blocked by Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Gintonin contains GPCR ligand LPAs in complexes with ginseng proteins and could be useful in the development of drugs targeting LPA receptors.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels through mRNA degradation or translation inhibition. Little is known regarding miRNA participation in regulating hematopoietic, or more specifically erythroid differentiation. This study was aimed at identifying erythroid lineage-specific miRNAs expressed during in vitro erythropoiesis using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human umbilical cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells. CD34+ hematopoietic cells were produced from hESCs in vitro and subsequently induced to differentiate into erythroid cells by culture in sequence on OP9 feeder cells and then with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in the presence of cytokines. Expression profiles of erythroid lineage-specific miRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR during in vitro differentiation. Expression levels of miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-146a and miR-451 were dynamically changed during differentiation of hESCs to CD34+ hematopoietic cells, and in subsequent differentiation of the CD34+ cells into the erythroid lineage. This suggests that these four miRNAs might be involved in regulating erythropoiesis.

Abstract: Ginsenoside, one of the active ingredients of Panax ginseng, has a variety of physiological and pharmacological actions in various organs. However, little is known about the effects of ginsenosides on gastrointestinal (GI) motility. We studied the modulation of pacemaker potentials by ginsenoside in the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in the current clamp mode. Among ginsenosides, we investigated the effects of ginsenoside Rb1, Rg3 and Rf. While externally applied Rb1 and Rg3 had no effects on pacemaker potentials, Rf caused membrane depolarization. The application of flufenamic acid or niflumic acid abolished the generation of pacemaker potentials and inhibited the Rf-induced membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization induced by Rf was not inhibited by intracellular application of guanosine 5’-[β-thio]diphosphate trilithium salt. Pretreatment with a Ca2+-free solution, thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum, U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, or 2-APB, an IP3 receptor inhibitor, abolished the generation of pacemaker potentials and suppressed Rf-induced actions. However, treatment with chelerythrine and calphostin C, protein kinase C inhibitors, did not block Rf-induced effects on pacemaker potentials. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rf modulates the pacemaker activities of ICCs and therby regulates intestinal motility.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is coupled to mRNA processing and chromatin modifications via the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit, consisting of multiple repeats of the heptapeptide YSPTSPS. Pioneering studies showed that CTD serines are differentially phosphorylated along genes in a prescribed pattern during the transcription cycle. Genome-wide analyses challenged this idea, suggesting that this cycle is not uniform among different genes. Moreover, the respective role of enzymes responsible for CTD modifications remains controversial. Here, we systematically profiled the location of the RNAPII phosphoisoforms in wild-type cells and mutants for most CTD modifying enzymes. Together with results of in vitro assays, these data reveal a complex interplay between the modifying enzymes, and provide evidence that the CTD cycle is uniform across genes. We also identify Ssu72 as the Ser7 phosphatase and show that proline isomerization is a key regulator of CTD dephosphorylation at the end of genes.

Abstract: Summary
Higher-order chromosome structure is assumed to control various DNA-templated reactions in eukaryotes. Meiotic chromosomes implement developed structures called “axes” and “loops”; both are suggested to tether each other, activating Spo11 to catalyze meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at recombination hotspots. We found that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Spo11 homolog Rec12 and its partners form two distinct subcomplexes, DSBC (Rec6-Rec12-Rec14) and SFT (Rec7-Rec15-Rec24). Mde2, whose expression is strictly regulated by the replication checkpoint, interacts with Rec15 to stabilize the SFT subcomplex and further binds Rec14 in DSBC. Rec10 provides a docking platform for SFT binding to axes and can partially interact with DSB sites located in loops depending upon Mde2, which is indicative of the formation of multiprotein-based tethered axis-loop complex. These data lead us to propose a mechanism by which Mde2 functions as a recombination initiation mediator to tether axes and loops, in liaison with the meiotic replication checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
The connection between cancer and inflammation is widely recognized, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that TIPE2 provides a molecular bridge from inflammation to cancer by targeting the Ras signaling pathway. TIPE2 binds the Ras-interacting domain of the RalGDS family of proteins, which are essential effectors of activated Ras. This binding prevented Ras from forming an active complex, thereby inhibiting the activation of the downstream signaling molecules Ral and AKT. Consequently, TIPE2 deficiency led to heightened activation of Ral and AKT, resistance to cell death, increased migration, and dysregulation of exocyst complex formation. Conversely, TIPE2 overexpression induced cell death and significantly inhibited Ras-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Importantly, TIPE2 expression was either completely lost or significantly downregulated in human hepatic cancer. Thus, TIPE2 is an inhibitor of both inflammation and cancer, and a potential drug target for inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.

Star-PAP Control of BIK Expression and Apoptosis Is Regulated by Nuclear PIPKIα and PKCδ Signaling,

Abstract: Summary
BIK protein is an initiator of mitochondrial apoptosis, and BIK expression is induced by proapoptotic signals, including DNA damage. Here, we demonstrate that 3′ end processing and expression of BIK mRNA are controlled by the nuclear PI4,5P2-regulated poly(A) polymerase Star-PAP downstream of DNA damage. Nuclear PKCδ is a key mediator of apoptosis, and DNA damage stimulates PKCδ association with the Star-PAP complex where PKCδ is required for Star-PAP-dependent BIK expression. PKCδ binds the PI4,5P2-generating enzyme PIPKIα, which is essential for PKCδ interaction with the Star-PAP complex, and PKCδ activity is directly stimulated by PI4,5P2. Features in the BIK 3′ UTR uniquely define Star-PAP specificity and may block canonical PAP activity toward BIK mRNA. This reveals a nuclear phosphoinositide signaling nexus where PIPKIα, PI4,5P2, and PKCδ regulate Star-PAP control of BIK expression and induction of apoptosis. This pathway is distinct from the Star-PAP-mediated oxidative stress pathway indicating signal-specific regulation of mRNA 3′ end processing.

Abstract: We studied the role of a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p190RhoGEF) in dendritic cells (DCs), using transgenic (TG) mice that over-express a full gene of p190RhoGEF under the control of an invariant chain promoter. TG mice lacked localization of activated DCs to the T cell zone in the spleen and had reduced serum levels of IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. DCs from these mice also showed reduced surface expression of CD86, CD40, and CD205, but not MHCII, as well as a reduced capability to uptake antigen. Moreover, chemokine-driven migration and secretion of IL-6, but not of IL-12, were impaired after LPS-stimulation of TG DCs. Collectively, these results suggest that over-expressing p190RhoGEF negatively regulates conventional DC function in response to bacterial LPS infection.

Abstract: Summary
The nervous system is enormously complex, yet the number of cues that control axonal growth is surprisingly meager. Posttranslational modifications amplify diversity, but the degree to which they are employed is unclear. Here, we show that Furin and SKI-1 combine with autocatalytic cleavage and a disulfide bridge to generate four membrane-bound and three soluble forms of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGMa). We provide in vivo evidence that these proprotein convertases are involved in axonal growth and that RGMa cleavage is essential for Neogenin-mediated outgrowth inhibition. Surprisingly, despite no sequence homology, N- and C-RGMa fragments bound the same Fibronectin-like domains in Neogenin and blocked outgrowth. This represents an example in which unrelated fragments from one molecule inhibit outgrowth through a single receptor domain. RGMa is a tethered membrane-bound molecule, and proteolytic processing amplifies RGMa diversity by creating soluble versions with long-range effects as well.

Glis3 Regulates Neurogenin 3 Expression in Pancreatic β-Cells and Interacts with Its Activator, Hnf6,

Abstract: The Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, Glis3, has been associated with neonatal diabetes in humans and mice, and implicated in the regulation of pancreatic β-cell generation. However, its precise function in the development of pancreatic β-cells has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we provide evidence that Glis3 regulates Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) through its distal promoter region. Previous studies showed that the distal region and proximal region of Ngn3 promoter contains various transcription binding sites, including binding sites for pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), Hnf1β and Hnf6. Interestingly, putative Glis3 binding sites (Glis3BS) were found in the distal region of Ngn3 promoter close to the Hnf6 binding sites. This suggested that along with Hnf6, Glis3 may also be involved in the regulation of Ngn3 expression. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that Glis3 can bind to the Ngn3 promoter directly and activate Ngn3 transcriptional activity. Additionally, Glis3 can interact directly with Hnf6 in vitro and in vivo. The amino-terminus in Glis3 and the homeodomain of Hnf6 are critical for this interaction. These data suggest that crosstalk between Glis3 and Hnf6 may play an important role in the regulation of Ngn3 during pancreatic endocrine progenitor cell specification and development.

Abstract: The development of rapid and efficient strategies to generate selectable marker-free transgenic plants could help increase the consumer acceptance of genetically modified (GM) plants. To produce marker-free transgenic plants without conditional treatment or the genetic crossing of offspring, we have developed a rapid and convenient DNA excision method mediated by the Cre/IoxP recombination system under the control of a -46 minimal CaMV 35S promoter. The results of a transient expression assay showed that -46 minimal promoter::Cre recombinase (-46::Cre) can cause the IoxP-specific excision of a selectable marker, thereby connecting the 35S promoter and β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Analysis of stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated a positive correlation between IoxP-specific DNA excision and GUS expression. PCR and DNA gel-blot analysis further revealed that nine of the 10 tested T1 transgenic lines carried both excised and non-excised constructs in their genomes. In the subsequent T2 generation plants, over 30% of the individuals for each line were marker-free plants harboring the excised construct only. These results demonstrate that the -46::Cre fusion construct can be efficiently and easily utilized for producing marker-free transgenic plants.

Abstract: Cryptorchidism is associated with male infertility due to germ cell loss in response to elevated temperature. However, there is a great deal of contradictory information prevalent on the status of germ cells and their process of removal in the cryptorchid testis. In the present study, we investigate the cell removal from cryptorchid rat testis by the methods of morphology and stereology. The testis weight is reduced according to previous reports after surgical induction of cryptorchidism. Interestingly, the epididymal weight is significantly increased in 7 days after surgery, and the caput epididymis tubules show filling with countless round germ cells. We found that the elongating spermatids (steps 10–13), newborn spermatids (step 1) and the dividing spermatocytes are the most susceptible cells to elevated temperature, and are the first disappeared cells from the seminiferous tubules after surgery. Germ cell removal followed the order, starting first with elongating spermatids and newborn spermatids, followed by round spermatids and elongated spermatids and later extending to spermatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissues provide circulating nutrients and hormones. We present in vivo mouse studies highlighting roles for Wnt signals in both aspects of metabolism. β-catenin activation in PPARγ-expressing fat progenitors (PBCA) decreased fat mass and induced fibrotic replacement of subcutaneous fat specifically. In spite of lipodystrophy, PBCA mice did not develop the expected diabetes and hepatosteatosis, but rather exhibited improved glucose metabolism and normal insulin sensitivity. Glucose uptake was increased in muscle independently of insulin, associated with cell-surface translocation of glucose transporters and AMPK activation. Ex vivo assays showed these effects were likely secondary to blood-borne signals since PBCA sera or conditioned media from PBCA fat progenitors enhanced glucose uptake and activated AMPK in muscle cultures. Thus, adipose progenitor Wnt activation dissociates lipodystrophy from dysfunctional metabolism and highlights a fat-muscle endocrine axis, which may represent a potential therapy to lower blood glucose and improve metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila Hibris (Hbs), a member of the Nephrin Immunoglobulin Super Family, has been implicated in myogenesis and eye patterning. Here, we uncover a role of Hbs in Notch (N) signaling and γ-secretase processing. Loss of hbs results in classical N-signaling-associated phenotypes in Drosophila, including eye patterning, wing margin, and sensory organ specification defects. In particular, hbs mutant larvae display altered γ-secretase-dependent Notch proteolytic processing. Hbs also interacts molecularly and genetically with Presenilin (Psn) and other components of the γ-secretase complex. This Hbs function appears conserved, as mammalian Nephrin also promotes N signaling in mammalian cells. Our data suggest that Hbs is required for Psn maturation. Consistent with its role in Psn processing, Hbs genetically interacts with the Drosophila β-amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl) protein, the homolog of mammalian APP, the cleavage of which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Hbs/Nephrin appear to share a general requirement in Psn/γ-secretase regulation and associated processes.

Abstract: To develop and characterize a novel cell culture method for the generation of undifferentiated and differentiated human mesenchymal stem cell 3D structures, we utilized the RWV system with a gelatin-based scaffold. 3 × 106 cells generated homogeneous spheroids and maximum spheroid loading was accomplished after 3 days of culture. Spheroids cultured in undifferentiated spheroids of 3 and 10 days retained expression of CD44, without expression of differentiation markers. Spheroids cultured in adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation media exhibited oil red O staining and von Kossa staining, respectively. Further characterization of osteogenic lineage, showed that 10 day spheroids exhibited stronger calcification than any other experimental group corresponding with significant expression of vitamin D receptor, alkaline phosphatase, and ERp60 . In conclusion this study describes a novel RWV culture method that allowed efficacious engineering of undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cell spheroids and rapid osteogenic differentiation. The use of gelatin scaffolds holds promise to design implantable stem cell tissue of various sizes and shapes for future regenerative treatment.

Abstract: Aquaporins (AQPs), notably AQP-1 and AQP-9, may contribute to reabsorption of fluid and solute across the epididymis. Ethanol is related to be a toxicant affecting directly or indirectly the epididymis and the sperm motility. This study examined the expression of AQP-1 and AQP-9 in adult epididymis of the UChA and UChB 10% (v/v) ethanol-preferring rats, focusing the ethanol-induced hormonal disturbances upon the regulation of these AQPs. Chronic ethanol intake significantly decreased body weight, while UChA and UChB rats displayed a marked loss of epididymal weights. Both ethanol-consuming animals had a severe reduction of testosterone levels, whereas LH and 17β-estradiol were unchanged. Throughout the epididymis, a strong reaction to AQP-1 was observed in myoid and endothelial cells of the UChB ethanol-preferring rats, differently from a moderate intensity in the initial segment of the UChA rats. In addition, AQP-9 showed a strong immunoreaction in the apical membrane of principal cells at initial segment. In cauda epididymis, the level of AQP-9 was reduced along the microvillus projections in both UChA and UChB rats compared to controls. We conclude that chronic ethanol consumption modulates the androgen levels, thereby modifying the expression pattern of AQP-1 and 9 in the epididymis.

Abstract: Rice stripe virus (RSV) is a viral disease that seriously impacts rice production in East Asia, most notably in Korea, China, and Japan. Highly RSV-resistant transgenic japonica rice plants were generated using a dsRNAi construct designed to silence the entire sequence region of the RSV-CP gene. Transgenic rice plants were inoculated with a population of viruliferous insects, small brown planthoppers (SBPH), and their resistance was evaluated using ELISA and an infection rate assay. A correlation between the expression of the RSV-CP homologous small RNAs and the RSV resistance of the transgenic rice lines was discovered. These plants were also analyzed by comparing the expression pattern of invading viral genes, small RNA production and the stable transmission of the RSV resistance trait to the T3 generation. Furthermore, the agronomic trait was stably transmitted to the T4 generation of transgenic plants.

Abstract: Summary
Optogenetics has been enthusiastically pursued in recent neuroscience research, and the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior is becoming ever more accessible. Here, we established knockin-mediated enhanced gene expression by improved tetracycline-controlled gene induction (KENGE-tet) and succeeded in generating transgenic mice expressing a highly light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 mutant at levels sufficient to drive the activities of multiple cell types. This method requires two lines of mice: one that controls the pattern of expression and another that determines the protein to be produced. The generation of new lines of either type readily expands the repertoire to choose from. In addition to neurons, we were able to manipulate the activity of nonexcitable glial cells in vivo. This shows that our system is applicable not only to neuroscience but also to any biomedical study that requires understanding of how the activity of a selected population of cells propagates through the intricate organic systems.

Abstract: CLCA proteins (calcium-activated chloride channel regulators) have been linked to diseases involving secretory disorders, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma. They have been shown to modulate endogenous chloride conductance, possibly by acting as metalloproteases. Based on the differential processing of the subunits after post-translational cleavage, two subgroups of CLCA proteins can be distinguished. In one subgroup, both subunits are secreted, in the other group, the carboxy-terminal subunit possesses a transmembrane segment, resulting in shedding of only the amino-terminal subunit. Recent data on the post-translational cleavage and proteolytic activity of CLCA are limited to secreted CLCA. In this study, we characterized the cleavage of mCLCA6, a murine CLCA possessing a transmembrane segment. As for secreted CLCA, the cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum was not observed for a protein with the E157Q mutation in the HEXXH motif of mCLCA6, suggesting that this mutant protein and secreted CLCA family members share a similar autoprote-olytic cleavage mechanism. In contrast to secreted CLCA proteins with the E157Q mutation, the uncleaved precursor of the mCLCA6E157Q mutant reached the plasma membrane, where it was cleaved and the amino-terminal subunit was shed into the supernatant. Using crude membrane fractions, we showed that cleavage of the mCLCA6E157Q protein is zinc-dependent and sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors, suggesting secondary cleavage by a metalloprotease. Interestingly, anchorage of mCLCA6E157Q to the plasma membrane is not essential for its secondary cleavage, because the mCLCA6ΔTME157Q mutant still underwent cleavage. Our data suggest that the processing of CLCA proteins is more complex than previously recognized.

Abstract: TCR of CD8 T cells recognizes peptides of 8-9 amino acids in length (epitope) complexed with MHC class I. Peptide ligands differing from an epitope by one or two amino acids are thought to modulate the immune response specific to that epitope. H60 is a minor histocompatibility antigen for which the specific CD8 T-cell response dominates during alloresponse after MHC-matched allogeneic transplantation. In the present study, we developed a transgenic mouse (designated H60H Tg) expressing a variant of H60, designated H60H, in which the arginine residue at position 4 of the H60 epitope sequence (LTFNYRNL) is replaced by a histidine residue (LTFHYRNL). Immunization of female C57BL/6 mice with splenocytes from male H60H Tg induced a CD8 T cell primary response and memory response after re-challenge. The response was CD4 help-dependent, demonstrating the potency of H60H as a cellular antigen. The response induced by the H60H cellular antigen was comparable to that induced by H60 in its peak magnitude and overall immune kinetics. H60H challenge recruited broadly diverse TCRs to the specific response, shaping a TCR repertoire different from that of the natural H60 epitope. However, some of the TCRs did overlap between the H60H- and H60-specific CD8 T cells, suggesting that H60H might modulate the H60-specific response. These results may provide a basis for the modulation of the H60-specific CD8 T-cell response.

Abstract: Summary
Polo-like kinase Plk1 controls numerous aspects of cell-cycle progression. We show that it associates with tRNA and 5S rRNA genes and regulates their transcription by RNA polymerase III (pol III) through direct binding and phosphorylation of transcription factor Brf1. During interphase, Plk1 promotes tRNA and 5S rRNA expression by phosphorylating Brf1 directly on serine 450. However, this stimulatory modification is overridden at mitosis, when elevated Plk1 activity causes Brf1 phosphorylation on threonine 270 (T270), which prevents pol III recruitment. Thus, although Plk1 enhances net tRNA and 5S rRNA production, consistent with its proliferation-stimulating function, it also suppresses untimely transcription when cells divide. Genomic instability is apparent in cells with Brf1 T270 mutated to alanine to resist Plk1-directed inactivation, suggesting that chromosome segregation is vulnerable to inappropriate pol III activity.

Abstract: Summary
Current strategies combining anti-angiogenic drugs with chemotherapy provide clinical benefit in cancer patients. It is assumed that anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, transiently normalize abnormal tumor vasculature and contribute to improved delivery of subsequent chemotherapy. To investigate this concept, a study was performed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabeled docetaxel ([11C]docetaxel). In NSCLC, bevacizumab reduced both perfusion and net influx rate of [11C]docetaxel within 5 hr. These effects persisted after 4 days. The clinical relevance of these findings is notable, as there was no evidence for a substantial improvement in drug delivery to tumors. These findings highlight the importance of drug scheduling and advocate further studies to optimize scheduling of anti-angiogenic drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Caveolin-1 is a major structural component of raft structures within the plasma membrane and has been implicated as a regulator of cellular signal transduction with prominent expression in adipocytes. Here, we embarked on a comprehensive characterization of the metabolic pathways dysregulated in caveolin-1 null mice. We found that these mice display decreased circulating levels of total and high molecular weight adiponectin and a reduced ability to change substrate use in response to feeding/fasting conditions. Caveolin-1 null mice are extremely lean but retain muscle mass despite lipodystrophy and massive metabolic dysfunction. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is chronically elevated, while hepatic steatosis is reduced. Our data suggest that the complex phenotype of the caveolin-1 null mouse is caused by altered metabolic and mitochondrial function in adipose tissue with a subsequent compensatory response driven mostly by the liver. This mouse model highlights the central contributions of adipose tissue for system-wide preservation of metabolic flexibility.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus subtilis MifM uses polypeptide-instructed ribosomal stalling to control translation of YidC2, a membrane protein biogenesis factor. In contrast to other stalling systems involving a single arrest point, our in vitro translation/toeprint experiments show that the B. subtilis ribosome stalls consecutively at multiple codons of MifM. This mode of elongation arrest depends on nascent chain residues at the middle of the ribosomal exit tunnel and a few (four for the maximum functionality) negative charges residing proximally to the arrest points. The latter element does not require exact amino acid sequence, and this feature may underlie the multisite stalling. The arrested nascent chains were not efficiently transferred to puromycin, suggesting that growing MifM nascent chains inhibit peptidyl transferase center after acquiring an acidic residue(s). Multisite stalling seems to provide a unique means for MifM to achieve a sufficient duration of ribosomal stalling required for the regulatory function.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate physiological and pathological processes by inducing posttranscriptional repression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) via incompletely understood mechanisms. To discover factors required for human miRNA activity, we performed an RNAi screen using a reporter cell line of miRNA-mediated repression of translation initiation. We report that reduced expression of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) dissociated miRNA complexes from target mRNAs, leading to increased polysome association, translation, and stability of miRNA-targeted mRNAs relative to untargeted mRNAs. RNA sequencing of polysomes indicated substantial overlap in sets of genes exhibiting increased or decreased polysomal association after Argonaute or RPG knockdowns, suggesting similarity in affected pathways. miRNA profiling of monosomes and polysomes demonstrated that miRNAs cosediment with ribosomes. RPG knockdowns decreased miRNAs in monosomes and increased their target mRNAs in polysomes. Our data show that most miRNAs repress translation and that the levels of RPGs modulate miRNA-mediated repression of translation initiation.

Abstract: Cnu is a small 71-amino acid protein that complexes with H-NS and binds to a specific sequence in the replication origin of the E. coli chromosome. To understand the mechanism of interaction between Cnu and H-NS, we used bacterial genetics to select and analyze Cnu variants that cannot complex with H-NS. Out of 2,000 colonies, 40 Cnu variants were identified. Most variants (82.5%) had a single mutation, but a few variants (17.5%) had double amino acid changes. An in vitro assay was used to identify Cnu variants that were truly defective in H-NS binding. The changes in these defective variants occurred exclusively at charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, or Lys) on the surface of the protein. We propose that the attractive force that governs the Cnu-H-NS interaction is an ionic bond, unlike the hydrophobic interaction that is the major attractive force in most proteins.

Abstract: Summary
C. elegans 21U-RNAs are equivalent to the piRNAs discovered in other metazoans and have important roles in gametogenesis and transposon control. The biogenesis and molecular function of 21U-RNAs and piRNAs are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that transcription of each 21U-RNA is regulated separately through a conserved upstream DNA motif. We use genomic analysis to show that this motif is associated with low nucleosome occupancy, a characteristic of many promoters that drive expression of protein-coding genes, and that RNA polymerase II is localized to this nucleosome-depleted region. We establish that the most conserved 8-mer sequence in the upstream region of 21U-RNAs, CTGTTTCA, is absolutely required for their individual expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 8-mer is specifically recognized by Forkhead family (FKH) transcription factors and that 21U-RNA expression is diminished in several FKH mutants. Our results suggest that thousands of small noncoding transcription units are regulated by FKH proteins.

Abstract: Legumes have evolved symbiotic interactions with rhizobial bacteria to efficiently utilize nitrogen. Recent progress in symbiosis has revealed several key components of host plants required for nitrogen-fixing nodule organogenesis, in which complicated metabolic and signaling pathways in the host plant are reprogrammed to generate nodules in the cortex upon perception of the rhizobial Nod factor. Following the recognition of Nod factors, plant hormones are likely to be essential throughout nodule organogenesis for integration of developmental and environmental signaling cues into nodule development. Here, we review the molecular events involved in plant hormonal regulation and signaling cross-talk for nitrogen-fixing nodule development, and discuss how these signaling networks are integrated into Nod factor-mediated signaling during plantmicrobe interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Developing organisms have evolved a wide range of mechanisms for coping with recurrent environmental challenges. How they cope with rare or unforeseen challenges is, however, unclear as are the implications to their unchallenged offspring. Here, we investigate these questions by confronting the development of the fly, D. melanogaster, with artificial tissue distributions of toxic stress that are not expected to occur during fly development. We show that under a wide range of toxic scenarios, this challenge can lead to modified development that may coincide with increased tolerance to an otherwise lethal condition. Part of this response was mediated by suppression of Polycomb group genes, which in turn leads to derepression of developmental regulators and their expression in new domains. Importantly, some of the developmental alterations were epigenetically inherited by subsequent generations of unchallenged offspring. These results show that the environment can induce alternative patterns of development that are stable across multiple generations.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is an antiapoptotic transcription factor. We show that the antiapoptotic actions of NF-κB are mediated by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). TNF-α treatment triples H2S generation by stimulating binding of SP1 to the CSE promoter. H2S generated by CSE stimulates DNA binding and gene activation of NF-κB, processes that are abolished in CSE-deleted mice. As CSE deletion leads to decreased glutathione levels, resultant oxidative stress may contribute to alterations in CSE mutant mice. H2S acts by sulfhydrating the p65 subunit of NF-κB at cysteine-38, which promotes its binding to the coactivator ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3). Sulfhydration of p65 predominates early after TNF-α treatment, then declines and is succeeded by a reciprocal enhancement of p65 nitrosylation. In CSE mutant mice, antiapoptotic influences of NF-κB are markedly diminished. Thus, sulfhydration of NF-κB appears to be a physiologic determinant of its antiapoptotic transcriptional activity.

Abstract: The transient receptor potential M2 channel (TRPM2) is the Ca2+-permeable cation channel controlled by cellular redox status via β-NAD+ and ADP-ribose (ADPR). TRPM2 activity has been reported to underlie susceptibility to cell death and biological processes such as inflammatory cell migration and insulin secretion. However, little is known about the intracellular mechanisms that regulate oxidative stress-induced cell death via TRPM2. We report here a molecular and functional interaction between the TRPM2 channel and EF-hand motif-containing protein EFHC1, whose mutation causes juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) via mechanisms including neuronal apoptosis. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrates TRPM2 and EFHC1 are coexpressed in hippocampal neurons and ventricle cells, while immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates physical interaction of the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions of TRPM2 with the EFHC1 protein. Coexpression of EFHC1 significantly potentiates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- and ADPR-induced Ca2+ responses and cationic currents via recombinant TRPM2 in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, EFHC1 enhances TRPM2-conferred susceptibility of HEK293 cells to H2O2-induced cell death, which is reversed by JME mutations. These results reveal a positive regulatory action of EFHC1 on TRPM2 activity, suggesting that TRPM2 contributes to the expression of JME phenotypes by mediating disruptive effects of JME mutations of EFHC1 on biological processes including cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Impaired insulin and IGF-1 signaling (iIIS) in C. elegans daf-2 mutants extends life span more than 2-fold. Constitutively, iIIS increases mitochondrial activity and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. By contrast, acute impairment of daf-2 in adult C. elegans reduces glucose uptake and transiently increases ROS. Consistent with the concept of mitohormesis, this ROS signal causes an adaptive response by inducing ROS defense enzymes (SOD, catalase), culminating in ultimately reduced ROS levels despite increased mitochondrial activity. Inhibition of this ROS signal by antioxidants reduces iIIS-mediated longevity by up to 60%. Induction of the ROS signal requires AAK-2 (AMPK), while PMK-1 (p38) and SKN-1 (NRF-2) are needed for the retrograde response. IIIS upregulates mitochondrial L-proline catabolism, and impairment of the latter impairs the life span-extending capacity of iIIS while L-proline supplementation extends C. elegans life span. Taken together, iIIS promotes L-proline metabolism to generate a ROS signal for the adaptive induction of endogenous stress defense to extend life span.

Abstract: Neuroendocrine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells are a main output of the sympathetic nervous system. Acute stress activates the sympatho-adrenal stress reflex, excites adrenal chromaffin cells, and elicits catecholamine secretion into the circulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that stress-evoked serum catecholamine levels are greater in males. We investigated potential mechanistic bases for this gender dimorphism at the level of the adrenal medulla. We utilized in situ single-cell perforated patch voltage clamp to measure basic electrophysiological parameters that affect cell excitability. We found that chromaffin cells from male and female mice exhibit statistically identical depolarization-evoked calcium currents. However, the resting capacitance, an index of cell surface area, was significantly higher in cells from female mice. Thus the current density in female cells was significantly lower. We found that inhibition of protein kinase C, an enzyme shown to regulate both exocytosis and endocytosis, eliminates the cell surface area gender dimorphism. Finally, we performed kinetic simulations of the secretion process and report a predicted elevated secretory capacity in male cells. Thus, regulation of cell size may act to decrease cell excitability in female cells and may in-part represent the mechanistic basis for increased stress-evoked catecholamine secretion described in males.

Abstract: Summary
Olfactory stimuli are detected by over 1,000 odorant receptors in mice, with each receptor being mapped to specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. The trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a small family of evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptors whose contribution to olfaction remains enigmatic. Here, we show that a majority of the TAARs are mapped to a discrete subset of glomeruli in the dorsal olfactory bulb of the mouse. This TAAR projection is distinct from the previously described class I and class II domains, and is formed by a sensory neuron population that is restricted to express TAAR genes prior to choice. We also show that the dorsal TAAR glomeruli are selectively activated by amines at low concentrations. Our data uncover a hard-wired, parallel input stream in the main olfactory pathway that is specialized for the detection of volatile amines.

Abstract: Anionic lipids are native membrane components that have a profound impact on many cellular processes, including regulated exocytosis. Nonetheless, the full nature of their contribution to the fast, Ca2+-triggered fusion pathway remains poorly defined. Here we utilize the tightly coupled quantitative molecular and functional analyses enabled by the cortical vesicle model system to elucidate the roles of specific anionic lipids in the docking, priming and fusion steps of regulated release. Studies with cholesterol sulfate established that effectively localized anionic lipids could contribute to Ca2+-sensing and even bind Ca2+ directly as effectors of necessary membrane rearrangements. The data thus support a role for phosphatidylserine in Ca2+ sensing. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol would appear to serve regulatory functions in the physiological fusion machine, contributing to priming and thus the modulation and tuning of the fusion process. We note the complexities associated with establishing the specific roles of (anionic) lipids in the native fusion mechanism, including their localization and interactions with other critical components that also remain to be more clearly and quantitatively defined.

Abstract: Summary
Irs2-mediated insulin/IGF1 signaling in the CNS modulates energy balance and glucose homeostasis; however, the site for Irs2 function is unknown. The hormone leptin mediates energy balance by acting on leptin receptor (LepR-b)-expressing neurons. To determine whether LepR-b neurons mediate the metabolic actions of Irs2 in the brain, we utilized Leprcre together with Irs2L/L to ablate Irs2 expression in LepR-b neurons (LeprΔIrs2). LeprΔIrs2 mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Leptin action was not altered in young LeprΔIrs2 mice, although insulin-stimulated FoxO1 nuclear exclusion was reduced in LeprΔIrs2 mice. Indeed, deletion of Foxo1 from LepR-b neurons in LeprΔIrs2 mice normalized energy balance, glucose homeostasis, and arcuate nucleus gene expression. Thus, Irs2 signaling in LepR-b neurons plays a crucial role in metabolic sensing and regulation. While not required for leptin action, Irs2 suppresses FoxO1 signaling in LepR-b neurons to promote energy balance and metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination (HR) plays an important role in the maintenance of genome integrity. HR repairs broken DNA during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which is vital for cell proliferation and is frequently upregulated in cancer cells, phosphorylates the essential Rad51 recombinase at serine 14 (S14) during the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. Strikingly, S14 phosphorylation licenses subsequent Rad51 phosphorylation at threonine 13 (T13) by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which in turn triggers direct binding to the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene product, Nbs1. This mechanism facilitates Rad51 recruitment to damage sites, thus enhancing cellular resistance to genotoxic stresses. Our results uncover a role of Plk1 in linking DNA damage recognition with HR repair and suggest a molecular mechanism for cancer development associated with elevated activity of Plk1.

Abstract: Aiming to better understand folliculogenesis, this study evaluated cell death and proliferation of ovarian cells, besides cathepsin-D expression in Prochilodus argenteus captured in two sites of the São Francisco River downstream from the Três Marias Dam, Brazil. In the site immediately following the Dam (S1), low levels of dissolved oxygen were registered in the rainy period. The water temperature was higher in the São Francisco River immediately after the confluence with the Abaeté River (S2), regardless of the period. In S1, the ovaries showed smaller oocytes, high caspase-3 enzymatic activity and apoptosis, lower cells in proliferation and GSI, as well as a lesser quantity of cathepsin-D when compared to females captured from S2. Regarding relative frequency of ovarian structures, in the dry period, only oogonia and perinucleolar oocytes were found in fish ovaries from both sites. On the other hand, in the rainy period, the relative frequency of oogonia and perinucleolar oocytes decreased and the vitellogenic oocytes increased in S2. Postovulatory follicles were observed only in S2, whereas atretic follicles occurred at a higher frequency in S1. Our results showed that apoptosis, cell proliferation and cathepsina-D evaluation can be used as biomarkers of environmental impact.

Abstract: The DJ-1 superfamily (DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily) is distributed across all three kingdoms of life. These proteins are involved in a highly diverse range of cellular functions, including chaperone and protease activity. DJ-1 proteins usually form dimers or hexamers in vivo and show at least four different binding orientations via distinct interface patches. Abnormal oligomerization of human DJ-1 is related to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease, suggesting important functional roles of quaternary structures. However, the quaternary structures of the DJ-1 superfamily have not been extensively studied. Here, we focus on the diverse oligomerization modes among the DJ-1 superfamily proteins and investigate the functional roles of quaternary structures both computationally and experimentally. The oligomerization modes are classified into 4 types (DJ-1, YhbO, Hsp, and YDR types) depending on the distinct interface patches (I-IV) upon dimerization. A unique, rotated interface via patch I is reported, which may potentially be related to higher order oligomerization. In general, the groups based on sequence similarity are consistent with the quaternary structural classes, but their biochemical functions cannot be directly inferred using sequence information alone. The observed phyletic pattern suggests the dynamic nature of quaternary structures in the course of evolution. The amino acid residues at the interfaces tend to show lower mutation rates than those of non-interfacial surfaces.

Abstract: Summary
Decapping represents a critical control point in regulating expression of protein coding genes. Here, we demonstrate that decapping also modulates expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Specifically, levels of >100 lncRNAs in yeast are controlled by decapping and are degraded by a pathway that occurs independent of decapping regulators. We find many lncRNAs degraded by DCP2 are expressed proximal to inducible genes. Of these, we show several genes required for galactose utilization are associated with lncRNAs that have expression patterns inversely correlated with their mRNA counterpart. Moreover, decapping of these lncRNAs is critical for rapid and robust induction of GAL gene expression. Failure to destabilize a lncRNA known to exert repressive histone modifications results in perpetuation of a repressive chromatin state that contributes to reduced plasticity of gene activation. We propose that decapping and lncRNA degradation serve a vital role in transcriptional regulation specifically at inducible genes.

Abstract: Summary
We analyzed the usage and consequences of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in Drosophila melanogaster by using >1 billion reads of stranded mRNA-seq across a variety of dissected tissues. Beyond demonstrating that a majority of fly transcripts are subject to APA, we observed broad trends for 3′ untranslated region (UTR) shortening in the testis and lengthening in the central nervous system (CNS); the latter included hundreds of unannotated extensions ranging up to 18 kb. Extensive northern analyses validated the accumulation of full-length neural extended transcripts, and in situ hybridization indicated their spatial restriction to the CNS. Genes encoding RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and transcription factors were preferentially subject to 3′ UTR extensions. Motif analysis indicated enrichment of miRNA and RBP sites in the neural extensions, and their termini were enriched in canonical cis elements that promote cleavage and polyadenylation. Altogether, we reveal broad tissue-specific patterns of APA in Drosophila and transcripts with unprecedented 3′ UTR length in the nervous system.

Abstract: The higher plants of today array a large number of small chloroplasts in their photosynthetic cells. This array of small chloroplasts results from organelle division via prokaryotic binary fission in a eukaryotic plant cell environment. Functional abnormalities of the tightly coordinated biochemical event of chloroplast division lead to abnormal chloroplast development in plants. Here, we described an abnormal chloroplast phenotype in an ethylene insensitive ethylene response1-1 (etr1-1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. Extensive transgenic and genetic analyses revealed that this organelle abnormality was not linked to etr1-1 or ethylene signaling, but linked to a second mutation in ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATIONS (ARCS), which was further verified by genetic complementation analysis. Despite the normal expression of other plastid division-related genes, the loss of ARCS caused the enlargement of chloroplasts as well as the diminution of a photosynthetic protein Rubisco in etr1-1. Our study has suggested that the increased size of the abnormal chloroplasts may not be able to fully compensate for the loss of a greater array of small chloroplasts in higher plants.

Abstract: Summary
WTX encodes a tumor suppressor, frequently inactivated in Wilms tumor, with both plasma membrane and nuclear localization. WTX has been implicated in β-catenin turnover, but its effect on nuclear proteins is unknown. We report an interaction between WTX and p53, derived from the unexpected observation of WTX, p53, and E1B 55K colocalization within the characteristic cytoplasmic body of adenovirus-transformed kidney cells. In other cells without adenovirus expression, the C-terminal domain of WTX binds to the DNA-binding domain of p53, enhances its binding to CBP, and increases CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys 373/382. WTX knockdown accelerates CBP/p300 protein turnover and attenuates this modification of p53. In p53-reconstitution experiments, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and p53 target-gene expression are suppressed by depletion of WTX. Together, these results suggest that WTX modulates p53 function, in part through regulation of its activator CBP/p300.

Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton by Rap1 Binding to RacGEF1,

Abstract: Rap1 is rapidly and transiently activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation and helps establish cell polarity by locally modulating cytoskeletons. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which Rap1 controls actin cytoskeletal reorganization in Dictyostelium and found that Rap1 interacts with RacGEFI in vitro and stimulates Factin polymerization at the sites where Rap1 is activated upon chemoattractant stimulation. Live cell imaging using GFP-coronin, a reporter for F-actin, demonstrates that cells expressing constitutively active Rap1 (Rap1CA) exhibit a high level of F-actin uniformly distributed at the cortex including the posterior and lateral sides of the chemotaxing cell. Examination of the localization of a PH-domain containing PIP3 reporter, PhdA-GFP, and the activation of Akt/Pkb and other Ras proteins in Rap1CA cells reveals that activated Rap1 has no effect on the production of PIP3 or the activation of Akt/Pkb and Ras proteins in response to chemoattractant stimulation. Rac family proteins are crucial regulators in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In vitro binding assay using truncated RacGEFI proteins shows that Rap1 interacts with the DH domain of RacGEFI. Taken together, these results suggest that Rapl-mediated F-actin polymerization probably occurs through the Rac signaling pathway by directly binding to RacGEFI.

Abstract: Since tenascin C is a factor expressed highly in the tumor-associated matrix, it would be a desirable first step for targeting the tumor-specific microenvironment. In fact, a high level of tenascin C expression has been reported in most solid tumors, including lung cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma. Therefore, the targeted binding of tenascin C in tumor stroma would inhibit tumor metastasis by modulating cancer cell growth and migration. We isolated a peptide that bound to tenascin C by phage display peptide library selection, and the selected peptide specifically recognized tenascin C protein in xenograft mouse tissue. We also observed exclusive staining of tenascin C by the selected peptide in tumor patient tissues. Moreover, the peptide reduced tenascin C-induced cell rounding and migration. We propose that the tenascin C targeting peptide may be useful as a specific anti-cancer diagnostic and therapeutic tool for most human solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates and activates AGC kinase family members, including Akt, SGK1, and PKC, in response to insulin/IGF1. The liver is a key organ in insulin-mediated regulation of metabolism. To assess the role of hepatic mTORC2, we generated liver-specific rictor knockout (LiRiKO) mice. Fed LiRiKO mice displayed loss of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation and reduced glucokinase and SREBP1c activity in the liver, leading to constitutive gluconeogenesis, and impaired glycolysis and lipogenesis, suggesting that the mTORC2-deficient liver is unable to sense satiety. These liver-specific defects resulted in systemic hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypolipidemia. Expression of constitutively active Akt2 in mTORC2-deficient hepatocytes restored both glucose flux and lipogenesis, whereas glucokinase overexpression rescued glucose flux but not lipogenesis. Thus, mTORC2 regulates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism via insulin-induced Akt signaling to control whole-body metabolic homeostasis. These findings have implications for emerging drug therapies that target mTORC2.

Abstract: Summary
The altered metabolism of tumors has been considered a target for anticancer therapy. However, the relationship between distinct tumor-initiating lesions and anomalies of tumor metabolism in vivo has not been addressed. We report that MYC-induced mouse liver tumors significantly increase both glucose and glutamine catabolism, whereas MET-induced liver tumors use glucose to produce glutamine. Increased glutamine catabolism in MYC-induced liver tumors is associated with decreased levels of glutamine synthetase (Glul) and the switch from Gls2 to Gls1 glutaminase. In contrast to liver tumors, MYC-induced lung tumors display increased expression of both Glul and Gls1 and accumulate glutamine. We also show that inhibition of Gls1 kills cells that overexpress MYC and catabolize glutamine. Our results suggest that the metabolic profiles of tumors are likely to depend on both the genotype and tissue of origin and have implications regarding the design of therapies targeting tumor metabolism.

Abstract: Impaired Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) underlies a primary pathogenesis of heart failure in the aging heart. Sarcalumenin (SAR), a Ca2+-binding glycoprotein located in the longitudinal SR, regulates Ca2+ reuptake by interacting with SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Here we found that the expression levels of both SAR and SERCA2 proteins were significantly downregulated in senescent wild-type mice (18-month old) and that downregulation of SAR protein preceded downregulation of SERCA2 protein. The downregulation of SERCA2 protein was greater in senescent SARKO mice than in age-matched senescent wild-type mice, which was at least in part due to progressive degradation of SERCA2 protein in SARKO mice. Senescent SARKO mice exhibited typical findings of heart failure such as increased sympathetic activity, impaired exercise tolerance, and upregulation of biomarkers of cardiac stress. Consequently, cardiac function was progressively decreased in senescent SARKO. We also found that the expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were significantly increased in senescent SARKO mice, indicating that senescent SARKO mice exhibited ER stress. Thus we uncovered the important role of SAR in maintaining Ca2+ transport activity of SERCA2a and cardiac function in the senescent population.
