Abstract: VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and signaling via VEGFRs extends beyond the classical roles in blood vessel formation. We previously showed VEGFRs were also expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and activation of VEGFR-2 by ultraviolet B (UVB) was involved in the pro-survival mechanism. Here, we show that both VEGF165 and UVB enhanced the expression of VEGFRs (including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1) in normal human melanocytes, and increased expression of VEGFRs by UVB was mediated through hypoxia and oxidative stress. Also, VEGF165 and UVB promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, and UVB-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 required PKA but not P38 MAPK. In addition, UVB and VEGF165 contributed to the over-expression of melanogenic proteins in melanocytes, which could be reduced by neutralization of VEGFR-1 and/or VEGFR-2. UVB, but not VEGF165 promoted cell proliferation, while neutralization of VEGFR-1 and/or VEGFR-2 abolished this effect. UVB showed stronger than VEGF165 in promoting tyrosinase activity and melanin production, while neutralization of VEGFR-2 was stronger in reducing these effects than that of VEGFR-1. Furthermore, tranexamic acid (TA) decreased tyrosinase activity and melanin production via inhibiting activation of VEGFRs and subsequent expression of melanogenic proteins in melanocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate that VEGFRs are functionally involved in UVB-induced melanogenesis, and TA can inhibit melanogenesis at least in part by targeting VEGFRs in melanocytes.

Abstract: Summary
The PI5P4Ks have been demonstrated to be important for cancer cell proliferation and other diseases. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting these kinases is understudied due to a lack of potent, specific small molecules available. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of a pan-PI5P4K inhibitor, THZ-P1-2, that covalently targets cysteines on a disordered loop in PI5P4Kα/β/γ. THZ-P1-2 demonstrates cellular on-target engagement with limited off-targets across the kinome. AML/ALL cell lines were sensitive to THZ-P1-2, consistent with PI5P4K's reported role in leukemogenesis. THZ-P1-2 causes autophagosome clearance defects and upregulation in TFEB nuclear localization and target genes, disrupting autophagy in a covalent-dependent manner and phenocopying the effects of PI5P4K genetic deletion. Our studies demonstrate that PI5P4Ks are tractable targets, with THZ-P1-2 as a useful tool to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PI5P4K inhibition and inform drug discovery campaigns for these lipid kinases in cancer metabolism and other autophagy-dependent disorders.

Abstract: SET domain-containing 5 (SETD5) is an uncharacterized member of the protein lysine methyltransferase family. Although it was reported that SETD5 gene mutations are associated with the several types of human cancer, its functional role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we used tissue samples from 147 patients with ESCC and ESCC cell lines to determine the clinicopathological significance of SETD5 in ESCC and its effects on ESCC stemness. We performed immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence imaging, and tumor sphere formation, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing, Transwell, and western blotting assays. SETD5 expression was upregulated in ESCC tissue and associated with primary tumor (pT) stage, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, shorter overall survival rate, and disease-free survival rate. Cox regression analyses indicated that SETD5 is an independent poor prognostic factor of ESCC. In addition, SETD5 expression was correlated with cancer stemness-related protein, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and CD68 expression. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SETD5 was co-localized with CD44 and SOX2 in TE10 and TE11 cells and that exposing cells to cobalt chloride increased HIF-1α, SETD5, and stemness-related protein expression in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, SETD5 expression was significantly correlated with the expression of cell cycle-related genes and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins. Finally, knocking down SETD5 downregulated the expression of stemness-related and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway proteins, while inhibiting tumor spheroid formation, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in ESCC cells. These results indicate that SETD5 expression is associated with cancer stemness and that SETD5 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for ESCC.

Abstract: This study aims to clarify the role and molecular mechanism of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial homeostasis in high glucose (HG)-induced endometrial cancer (EC). Normal endometrium and tumor tissues of EC patients with normal and HG levels were collected, and Drp1 and p-Drp1 expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry. Human EC cells were cultured with different glucose concentrations, and Drp1 and p-Drp1 expression levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Cell models of control and siDrp1 groups under normal and HG conditions were established, and subsequent functional experiments were conducted. Histology and in vitro experiments showed that the HG environment increased Drp1 activation, which could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the imbalance of mitochondrial homeostasis mediated by Drp1 resulted in cell dysfunction, including altered glucose metabolism and increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion. All these changes caused by HG could be partially alleviated by Drp1 knockdown. This study revealed that Drp1 was involved in the progression of EC associated with HG, and Drp1 might be a new potential therapeutic target for EC patients with diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Alphaviruses are emerging, mosquito-transmitted RNA viruses with poorly understood cellular tropism and species selectivity. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We discovered that while expression of mouse, rat, chimpanzee, dog, horse, goat, sheep, and human Mxra8 enables alphavirus infection in cell culture, cattle Mxra8 does not. Cattle Mxra8 encodes a 15-amino acid insertion in its ectodomain that prevents Mxra8 binding to CHIKV. Identical insertions are present in zebu, yak, and the extinct auroch. As other Bovinae lineages contain related Mxra8 sequences, this insertion likely occurred at least 5 million years ago. Removing the Mxra8 insertion in Bovinae enhances alphavirus binding and infection, while introducing the insertion into mouse Mxra8 blocks CHIKV binding, prevents infection by multiple alphaviruses in cells, and mitigates CHIKV-induced pathogenesis in mice. Our studies on how this insertion provides resistance to CHIKV infection could facilitate countermeasures that disrupt Mxra8 interactions with alphaviruses.

Abstract: Increasing evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial regulatory role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. However, no study has examined the potential biological function and expression profile of circRNAs in keloid dermal fibroblasts (KDFs). Therefore, the aim of this study to investigate the expression profile of circRNAs and analyze their role in KDFs. Bioinformatic analyses and high-throughput RNA sequencing technology were applied to explore the expression profile of circRNAs in 3 human KDFs and normal dermal fibroblasts (NDFs). The differentially expressed circRNAs were verified by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. A circRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA interaction network was created using bioinformatics tools. Hsa_circ_0008259, was selected to confirm its function by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Collectively, 411 circRNAs, of which 206 were upregulated and 205 decreased, were found to be differentially expressed in KDFs and could bind to 2532 miRNA response elements (MREs). GO and KEGG pathways enrichment analyses showed that differentially expressed circRNAs were mainly involved in apoptosis, focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt and metabolic pathway, and may regulate the pathogenesis and development of keloid. Two candidate circRNAs (hsa_circRNA_0008259, hsa_circRNA_0005480) were verified to be significantly reduced in KDFs, and one candidate circRNA (hsa_circRNA_0002198) was significantly elevated in accordance with RNA-Seq data analysis. Overexpression of hsa_circRNA_0008259 inhibited type I and Ⅲ collagen expression. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that circRNAs exhibits differential expression in KDFs, and may be key players in the pathogenesis of keloid, or act as biomarkers of keloid.

Abstract: Advanced gastric cancer (GC) is aggressive with a high mortality rate. Rhesus family, C glycoprotein (RhCG) participates in tumor progression in many cancers, however its function in GC is still unknown. Here, we showed that RhCG was overexpressed in GC tissues at mRNA (P = 0.036) and protein levels (P < 0.05) compared with normal tissues. High RhCG level was correlated with poor differentiation (P = 0.037), TNM stage (P < 0.001), high HER-2 level (P = 0.018) and worse prognosis (P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard model indicated that RhCG level was an independent prognostic biomarker. RhCG knockdown significantly decreased pHi and impeded tumor cellular proliferation, migration and invasion and repressed β-catenin and c-myc expression in GC cells. Moreover, GC cells with high RhCG level had reduced oxaliplatin efficacy suggesting a role for RhCG as a therapeutic target for GC. Our findings revealed a function of RhCG in cancer pathogenesis, invasion and metastasis in human GC. We suggest that RhCG act may as a novel prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target for gastric adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: The immune system is felt to play an essential role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial in maintaining immune tolerance and immune homeostasis, but their role in the pathogenesis of PF is controversial and still unclear. We here explored the relationship between peripheral blood CD4+CD25+ Tregs and the course of bleomycin-induced PF in mice. Mouse PF models were established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Lung histology, hydroxyproline, Th1/Th2 balanc, CD4+CD25+ Tregse were analyzed at the 3rd，7th，14th，21st and 28th days after instillation. CD4+CD25+ Tregs were also transferred into mice with or without PF by tail vein injection. The trend of CD4+CD25+ Tregs changes was increased firstly, decreased, increased again from 7th to 28th days after bleomycin instillation, which had great relevance with alveolitis and fibrosis scores. There also were high Th1 polarization index from 3rd to 14th days and high Th2 polarization index at 21st and 28th days after bleomycin treatment. CD4+CD25+ Tregs could promote the secretion of Th2 cytokines and inhibit the secretion of Th1 cytokines, allow the Th1/Th2 balance to Th2 direction in PF. Moreover, preventive adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ Tregs may ameliorate the process of PF, while acute adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ Tregs may aggravate the process of PF. These findings suggested that the dynamic changes of CD4+CD25+ Tregs as dependent factor might designate a different course of PF induced by bleomycin in mice, and might be a selected drug use indicator for therapy of PF.

Abstract: Occupational exposure to silica dust particles was the major cause of pulmonary fibrosis, and many miRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate target mRNAs in silicosis. In the present study, we found that a decreasing level of miR-411–3p in silicosis rats and lung fibroblasts induced by TGF-β1. Enlargement of miR-411–3p could inhibit the cell proliferation and migration in lung fibroblasts with TGF-β1 treatment and attenuate lung fibrosis in silicotic mice. In addition, a mechanistic study showed that miR-411–3p exert its inhibitory effect on Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) expression and decrease ubiquitination degradation of Smad7 regulated by smurf2, result in blocking of TGF-β/Smad signaling. We proposed that increased expression of miR-411–3p abrogates silicosis by blocking activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling through decreasing ubiquitination degradation effect of smurf2 on Smad7.

Abstract: The present study sought to evaluate mRNA expression profiles in the cultured dermal fibroblasts of Tharparkar (zebu) and Karan-Fries (zebu, Tharparkar × taurine, Holstein Friesian) cattle in response to heat stress. Bioinformatics’ analysis identified temperature-regulated biological processes and pathways. Biological processes overrepresented among the earliest genes induced by temperature stress include regulation of stress responses, protein repair, metabolism, protein transport, cell division, and apoptosis. The present microarray platform contains 51,338 synthesized oligonucleotide probes corresponding to at least 36,713 unigenes. A total of 11,183 and 8126 transcripts were differentially expressed with a fold change of ≥ 2 in Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle, respectively. Randomly selected real-time validation showed 83.33% correlation with microarray data. Functional annotation and pathway study of the differentially expressed transcripts or genes (DEGs) reveal that upregulated genes significantly (P < 0.05) affect protein processing and NOD-like receptor pathways (NLRs), while downregulated genes were significantly (P < 0.05) found to be associated with cell cycle, metabolism, and protein transport. Gene expression changes include activation of heat shock factors (HSFs), increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), and apoptosis, while decreasing protein synthesis and another metabolism. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanism of the physiology of heat stress in Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle. Understanding the biology and mechanisms of heat stress is critical to developing approaches to ameliorate current production issues for improving animal performance and agriculture economics in tropical climatic conditions. In conclusion, the present study indicates that heat stress differentially affects the expression of the significant number of genes associated with stress response, metabolism, apoptosis, and protein transport in dermal fibroblasts of Tharparkar and Karan-Fries cattle.

Abstract: Summary
Several distinct differentiation protocols for deriving pancreatic progenitors (PPs) from human pluripotent stem cells have been described, but it remains to be shown how similar the PPs are across protocols and how well they resemble their in vivo counterparts. Here, we evaluated three differentiation protocols, performed RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing on isolated PPs derived with these, and compared them with fetal human pancreas populations. This enabled us to define a shared transcriptional and epigenomic signature of the PPs, including several genes not previously implicated in pancreas development. Furthermore, we identified a significant and previously unappreciated cross-protocol variation of the PPs through multi-omics analysis and demonstrate how such information can be applied to refine differentiation protocols for derivation of insulin-producing beta-like cells. Together, our study highlights the importance of a detailed characterization of defined cell populations derived from distinct differentiation protocols and provides a valuable resource for exploring human pancreatic development.

Abstract: Summary
The fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is the first identified demethylase of the internal RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which also exhibits demethylation activity toward N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) and N1-methyladenosine (m1A). Demethylation of m6A at specific sites on target transcripts is a key enzymatic function of FTO that modulates diverse physiological and/or pathological processes. However, how FTO selects target RNA and whether additional interaction proteins facilitate this process remain elusive. Herein, via the genetically encoded and site-specific photocrosslinking strategy, we identified the major RNA-binding protein SFPQ as a direct interaction partner of FTO. Our study showed that FTO and SFPQ were located in close proximity throughout the transcriptome and that overexpression of SFPQ led to the demethylation of adjacent m6As, likely through recruiting FTO to these specific RNA sites. These results uncovered a new layer of regulation mechanism that may assist FTO to gain substrate specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) contribute to bacterial adaptation and evolution; however, high-throughput, unbiased MGE detection remains challenging. We describe MGEfinder, a bioinformatic toolbox that identifies integrative MGEs and their insertion sites by using short-read sequencing data. MGEfinder identifies the genomic site of each MGE insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. We apply MGEfinder to 12,374 sequenced isolates of 9 prevalent bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and identify thousands of MGEs, including candidate insertion sequences, conjugative transposons, and prophage elements. The MGE repertoire and insertion rates vary across species, and integration sites often cluster near genes related to antibiotic resistance, virulence, and pathogenicity. MGE insertions likely contribute to antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Additionally, we identified thousands of mobility genes, a subset of which have unknown function opening avenues for exploration. Future application of MGEfinder to commensal bacteria will further illuminate bacterial adaptation and evolution.

Abstract: In female meiosis, oocyte meiotic maturation is a form of asymmetric cell division, producing the first polar body and a large oocyte, in which the asymmetry of oocyte meiotic division depends on spindle migration and positioning, and cortical polarization. In this study, we conclude that WDR62 (WD40-repeat protein 62) plays an important role in asymmetric meiotic division during mouse oocyte maturation. Our initial study demonstrated that WDR62 mainly co-localized with chromosomes during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Interference of Wdr62 by siRNA microinjection did not affect germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) but compromised the first polar body extrusion (PBE) with the large polar bodies generated, which is coupled with a higher incidence of spindle abnormality and chromosome misalignment. Further analysis concluded that loss of WDR62 blocked asymmetric spindle positioning and actin cap formation, which should be responsible for large polar body extrusion. Moreover, WDR62 decline intervened with the Arp2/3 complex, an upstream regulator for the cortical actin. Besides for p-MAPK, a critical regulator for the asymmetric division of oocyte, WDR62-depleted oocytes showed perturbation only in localization pattern but not expression level. In summary, our study defines WDR62 as an essential cytoskeletal regulator of spindle migration and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.

Abstract: SRY-related high-mobility-group box 12 (SOX12) has currently emerged as a key cancer-related protein in multiple human cancer types. However, little is known about the relevance of SOX12 in multiple myeloma (MM). The current study aimed to investigate the potential role of SOX12 in MM. Our results demonstrated that SOX12 expression was markedly elevated in MM cell lines. A series of cellular assays demonstrated that SOX12 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation and colony formation, and upregulated cell apoptosis of MM cells. By contrast, SOX12 overexpression promoted the proliferation, colony formation and decreased the apoptosis of MM cells, results that reveal its oncogenic effects. SOX12 regulated β-catenin expression and TCF/LEF transcriptional activity. Moreover, the SOX12-knockdown-mediated antitumor effect in MM cells was significantly reversed by transfecting a β-catenin expression vector. Notably, SOX12 inhibition retarded tumor growth in vivo of a MM-derived mouse xenograft model. In conclusion, our results suggest a potential oncogenic function for SOX12 in MM. Our findings reveal that SOX12 knockdown inhibits the growth of MM cells by downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, results that imply SOX12 may represent a novel therapeutic target for MM treatment.

Abstract: Loss of neuron homeostasis in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) is responsible for diet-induced-obesity (DIO). We previously reported that loss of Rb1 gene compromised the homeostasis of anorexigenic POMC neurons in ARC and induced obesity in mice. To evaluate the development of DIO, we propose to analyze the transcriptomic alteration of POMC neurons in mice following high fat diet (HFD) feeding. We isolated these neurons from established DIO mice and performed transcriptomic profiling using RNA-seq. In total, 1066 genes (628 upregulated and 438 downregulated) were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Pathway enrichment analysis with these DEGs further revealed that “cell cycle,” “apoptosis,” “chemokine signaling,” and “sphingolipid metabolism” pathways were correlated with DIO development. Moreover, we validated that the pRb protein, a key regulator of “cell cycle pathway,” was inactivated by phosphorylation in POMC neurons by HFD feeding. Importantly, the reversal of deregulated cell cycle by stereotaxic delivering of the unphosphorylated pRbΔP in ARC significantly meliorated the DIO. Collectively, our study provides insights into the mechanisms related to the loss of homeostasis of POMC neurons in DIO, and suggests pRb phosphorylation as a potential intervention target to treat DIO.

Abstract: FAM122A is a highly conserved protein in mammals, however its function is still largely unknown so far. In this study, we investigated the potential role of FAM122A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By analyzing HCC patient cohorts from RNA sequencing datasets, we found the expression level of FAM122A mRNA is significantly upregulated in HCC patients. Moreover, this abnormally higher expression pattern of FAM122A protein was also found in partial HCC tumor tissues, compared with the normal parts. Further, we demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FAM122A knockout significantly inhibits the growth, clonogenic potential and xenografts of HCC cells, induces cell cycle arrest and reduces the expression of proliferation-related genes. Interestingly, FAM122A deletion significantly enhances the cytotoxicity effect of Doxorubicin (Dox), a drug used in standard chemotherapy in HCC patients. In contrary, overexpression of FAM122A not only promotes HCC cell growth, but also inhibits Dox-induced DNA damage and cell death. Considering that FAM122A is previously identified as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, we asked whether FAM122A regulating HCC cell growth is associated with PP2A. The results showed FAM122A can also modulate PP2A activity in HCC cells although the modulated effect is relatively slight, however, treatment with a PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid did not rescue the inhibitory effects of cell growth and proliferation in FAM122A deletion cells, indicating that FAM122A may support HCC cell growth independent of its ability to modulate PP2A. Collectively, these results suggest that FAM122A is required for maintaining HCC cell growth, and its elimination combined with chemotherapy may represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.

Abstract: Abstract;
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely studied for their application in cell therapy. A noticed drawback of these cells in response to tissue injury is the low efficiency of homing. The present study was undertaken to explore a possible approach to promote the migration of MSCs. Primary cultures of rat adipose-derived stem cells (rADSCs) were cultured in standard L-DMEM media supplemented with or without copper (Cu) at its final concentration of 20 μM in cultures. The analyses of transwell and wound-healing assay revealed that Cu supplementation significantly promotes the migration of rADSCs in cultures. Further analysis found that Cu stimulated the phosphorylation of vimentin Ser39. Point mutation of vimentin Ser39 by substituting Ser with Ala prevented Cu-promoted migration of rADSCs. This study thus demonstrates that Cu promotes migration of rADSCs in cultures through at least in part Cu stimulation of vimentin Ser39 phosphorylation.

Abstract: Symptom of ventricular hypertrophy caused by cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) mutations is mild, while patients often showed high incidence of sudden cardiac death. The 92nd arginine to glutamine mutation (R92Q) of cTnT was one of the mutant hotspots in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are no such human disease models yet. To solve this problem, we generated TNNT2 R92Q mutant hESC cell lines (heterozygote or homozygote) using TALEN mediated homologous recombination in this study. After directed cardiac differentiation, we found a relative larger cell size in both heterozygous and homozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. Expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase2a (SERCA2a) were downregulated, while myocyte specific enhancer factor 2c (MEF2c) and the ratio of beta myosin to alpha myosin heavy chain (MYH7/MYH6) were increased in heterozygous TNNT2 R92Q hESC-cardiomyocytes. TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes exhibited efficient responses to heart-related pharmaceutical agents. We also found TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes showed increased calcium sensitivity and contractility. Further, engineered heart tissues (EHTs) prepared by combining rat decellularized heart extracellular matrices with heterozygous R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes showed similar drug responses as to HCM patients and increased sensitivity to caspofungin-induced cardiotoxicity. Using RNA-sequencing of TNNT2 R92Q heterozygous mutant cardiomyocytes, we found dysregulation of calcium might participated in the early development of hypertrophy. Our hESC-derived TNNT2 R92Q mutant cardiomyocytes and EHTs are good in vitro human disease models for future disease studies and drug screening.

Abstract: Human adipose tissue includes large quantities of mesenchymal stromal cells (atMSCs), which represent an abundant cell source for therapeutic applications in the field of regenerative medicine. Adipose tissue secrets various soluble factors including endocannabinoids, and atMSCs express the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This indicates that adipose tissue possesses an endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is also ascribed great significance for wound repair, e.g. by modulating inflammation. However, the exact effects of CB1/CB2 activation in human atMSCs have not been investigated, yet. In the present study, we stimulated human atMSCs with increasing concentrations (1–30 μM) of the unspecific cannabinoid receptor ligand WIN55,212–2 and the specific CB2 agonist JWH-133, either alone or co-applied with the receptor antagonist Rimonabant (CB1) or AM 630 (CB2). We investigated the effects on metabolic activity, cell number, differentiation and cytokine release, which are important processes during tissue regeneration. WIN decreased metabolic activity and cell number, which was reversed by Rimonabant. This suggests a CB1 dependent mechanism, whereas the number of atMSCs was increased after CB2 ligation. WIN and JWH increased the release of VEGF, TGF-β1 and HGF. Adipogenesis was enhanced by WIN, which could be reversed by blocking CB1. There was no effect on osteogenesis, and only WIN increased chondrogenic differentiation. Our results indicate that definite activation of the cannabinoid receptors exerted different effects in atMSCs, which could be of specific value in cell-based therapy for wound regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) has recently been devised as a label-free method for target validation of small compounds and monitoring the thermal stabilization or destabilization of proteins due to binding with the compound. Herein, we developed a modified method by combining the CETSA and proteomics analysis based on 2D gel electrophoresis, namely 2DE-CETSA, to identify the thermal stability-shifted proteins by binding with a new compound. We applied the 2DE-CETSA for analysis of a target-unknown compound, NPD10084, which exerts anti-proliferative activity against colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and identified pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) as a candidate target protein. Interestingly, NPD10084 interrupted protein-protein interactions between PKM2 and β-catenin or STAT3, with subsequent suppression of downstream signaling. We thus demonstrate that our 2DE-CETSA method is applicable for identification of target compounds discovered by phenotypic screening.

Abstract: Summary
In high-transmission regions, we expect parasite lineages within complex malaria infections to be unrelated due to parasite inoculations from different mosquitoes. This project was designed to test this prediction. We generated 485 single-cell genome sequences from fifteen P. falciparum malaria patients from Chikhwawa, Malawi—an area of intense transmission. Patients harbored up to seventeen unique parasite lineages. Surprisingly, parasite lineages within infections tend to be closely related, suggesting that superinfection by repeated mosquito bites is rarer than co-transmission of parasites from a single mosquito. Both closely and distantly related parasites comprise an infection, suggesting sequential transmission of complex infections between multiple hosts. We identified tetrads and reconstructed parental haplotypes, which revealed the inbred ancestry of infections and non-Mendelian inheritance. Our analysis suggests strong barriers to secondary infection and outbreeding amongst malaria parasites from a high transmission setting, providing unexpected insights into the biology and transmission of malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Artemisin combination therapy (ACT) is the main treatment option for malaria, which is caused by the intracellular parasite Plasmodium. However, increased resistance to ACT highlights the importance of finding new drugs. Recently, the aspartic proteases Plasmepsin IX and X (PMIX and PMX) were identified as promising drug targets. In this study, we describe dual inhibitors of PMIX and PMX, including WM382, that block multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. We demonstrate that PMX is a master modulator of merozoite invasion and direct maturation of proteins required for invasion, parasite development, and egress. Oral administration of WM382 cured mice of P. berghei and prevented blood infection from the liver. In addition, WM382 was efficacious against P. falciparum asexual infection in humanized mice and prevented transmission to mosquitoes. Selection of resistant P. falciparum in vitro was not achievable. Together, these show that dual PMIX and PMX inhibitors are promising candidates for malaria treatment and prevention.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt signaling is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs); however, the molecular mechanism involved is still obscure. SFRP1, a Wnt inhibitor, is downregulated in various human cancers; however, its role in tumor initiation and CSC regulation remains unexplored. Here, we used a skin carcinogenesis model, which showed early tumor initiation in Sfrp1−/− (Sfrp1 knockout) mice and increased tumorigenic potential of Sfrp1−/− CSCs. Expression profiling on Sfrp1−/− CSCs showed upregulation of genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, stemness, proliferation, and metastasis. Further, SOX-2 and SFRP1 expression was validated in human skin cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer. The data showed downregulation of SFRP1 and upregulation of SOX-2, establishing their inverse correlation. Importantly, we broadly uncover an inverse correlation of SFRP1 and SOX-2 in epithelial cancers that may be used as a potential prognostic marker in the management of cancer.

Abstract: Microtubule-binding proteins provide an alternative and vital pathway to the functional diversity of microtubules. Considerable work is still required to understand the complexities of microtubule-associated cellular processes and to identify novel microtubule-binding proteins. In this study, we identify Bcl2-associated athanogene cochaperone 6 (BAG6) as a novel microtubule-binding protein and reveal that it is crucial for primary ciliogenesis. By immunofluorescence we show that BAG6 largely colocalizes with intracellular microtubules and by co-immunoprecipitation we demonstated that it can interact with α-tubulin. Additionally, both the UBL and BAG domains of BAG6 are indispensable for its interaction with α-tubulin. Moreover, the assembly of primary cilia in RPE-1 cells is significantly inhibited upon the depletion of BAG6. Notably, BAG6 inhibition leads to an abnormal G0/G1 transition during the cell cycle. In addition, BAG6 colocalizes and interactes with the centrosomal protein γ-tubulin, suggesting that BAG6 might regulate primary ciliogenesis through its action in centrosomal function. Collectively, our findings suggest that BAG6 is a novel microtubule-bindng protein crucial for primary ciliogenesis.

Abstract: Regulation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates plays a crucial role in signal transduction, membrane trafficking or autophagy. Members of the myotubularin family of lipid phosphatases contribute to phosphoinositide metabolism by counteracting the activity of phosphoinositide kinases. The mechanisms determining their subcellular localization and targeting to specific membrane compartments are still poorly understood. We show here that the inactive phosphatase MTMR9 localizes to the intermediate compartment and to the Golgi apparatus and is able to recruit its active phosphatase partners MTMR6 and MTMR8 to these locations. Furthermore, MTMR8 and MTMR9 co-localize with the small GTPase RAB1A and regulate its localization. Loss of MTMR9 expression compromises the integrity of the Golgi apparatus and results in altered distribution of RAB1A and actin nucleation-promoting factor WHAMM. Loss or overexpression of MTMR9 leads to decreased rate of protein secretion. We demonstrate that secretion of physiologically relevant cargo exemplified by the WNT3A protein is affected after perturbation of MTMR9 levels.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobial resistance in tuberculosis (TB) is a public health threat of global dimension, worsened by increasing drug resistance. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging concept currently explored as an adjunct therapeutic strategy for TB. One potential host target is the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which binds TB virulence factors and controls antibacterial responses. Here, we demonstrate that in the context of therapy, the AhR binds several TB drugs, including front line drugs rifampicin (RIF) and rifabutin (RFB), resulting in altered host defense and drug metabolism. AhR sensing of TB drugs modulates host defense mechanisms, notably impairs phagocytosis, and increases TB drug metabolism. Targeting AhR in vivo with a small-molecule inhibitor increases RFB-treatment efficacy. Thus, the AhR markedly impacts TB outcome by affecting both host defense and drug metabolism. As a corollary, we propose the AhR as a potential target for HDT in TB in adjunct to canonical chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic mechanisms controlling adult mammalian stem cell (SC) dynamics might be critical for tissue regeneration but are poorly understood. Mouse skin and hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) display reduced histone H3 K4me3, K9me3, and K27me3 methylation levels (hypomethylation) preceding hair growth. Chemical inhibition of relevant histone demethylases impairs subsequent differentiation and growth of HFs and delays wound healing. In wounding, this impairs epithelial cell differentiation and blood vessel recruitment, but not proliferation and fibroblast recruitment. With Aspm-CreER as a newfound inter-follicular epidermis lineage-labeling tool, and Lgr5-CreER for hair follicles, we demonstrate a reduced contribution of both lineages to wound healing after interfering with hypomethylation. Blocked hypomethylation increases BMP4 expression and selectively upregulates H3 K4me3 on the Bmp4 promoter, which may explain the effects on HFSC quiescence, hair cycle, and injury repair. Thus, transient hypomethylation of histone H3 K4/9/27me3 is essential for adult skin epithelial SC dynamics for proper tissue homeostasis and repair.

Abstract: Gene expression studies and gene therapy require efficient gene delivery into cells. Different technologies by viral and non-viral mechanisms have been used for gene delivery into cells. Small gene vectors transfer across the cell membrane with a relatively high efficiency, but not large genes or entire loci spanning several kilobases, which do not remain intact following introduction. Previously, we developed an efficient delivery system based on herpes virus simplex type 1 (HSV-1) amplicons to transfer large fragments of DNA incorporated in human artificial chromosome (HAC) vectors into the nucleus of human cells. The HSV-1 amplicon lacks the signals for cleavage and replication of its own genome, yet each amplicon has the capacity to incorporate up to 150 kb of exogenous DNA. In this study, we investigated whether the capacity of gene delivery could be increased by simultaneously introducing multiple HSV-1 modified amplicons carrying a gene expressing HAC vector into cells with the aim of generating a single artificial chromosome containing the desired genes. Following co-transduction of two HSV-1 HAC amplicons, artificial chromosomes were successfully generated containing the introduced genes, which were appropriately expressed in different human cell types.

Abstract: Abundant with organelle-like membranous structures, the tumor microenvironment is composed of cancer cells that secrete exosomes. Studies have shown that these secreted exosomes transport RNA and active molecules to other cells to reshape the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor growth. In fact, we found that exosomes derived from melanoma cells drive pre-malignant transition in primary melanocytes. However, there is little available in the scientific literature on how exosomes modulate melanocytes in the microenvironment to optimize conditions for tumor progression and metastasis. We therefore focused this current study on identifying these conditions genetically. Through RNA sequencing, we analyzed gene expression levels of melanocytes driven by exosomes derived from melanoma and lung cancer cells compared with those without exosome controls. Significant differences were found in gene expression patterns of melanocytes driven by exosomes derived from melanoma and lung cancer cells. In the melanocytes responding to exosomes derived from melanoma cells, genes of lipopolysaccharide and regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis were predominant. In the melanocytes responding to exosomes derived from lung cancer cells, genes of DNA replication and mitotic nuclear division played an important role. These results provide further mechanistic understanding of tumor progression promoted by tumor-derived exosomes. This will also help identify potential therapeutic targets for melanoma progression.

Abstract: Reprogrammed glucose metabolism is essential for tumor initiation and development, especially for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Most cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed “the Warburg effect”, to support uncontrolled proliferation and evade apoptosis. However, the direct regulators of the Warburg effect remain areas of active investigation. In this study, we found that the highly conserved transcription factor, TWIST1, is a crucial regulator of aerobic glycolysis in PDAC. Genetic silencing of TWIST1 significantly inhibited the glycolytic phenotypes of PDAC cells as revealed by reduced glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate, which can be restored by re-expression of siRNA-resistant TWIST1. Moreover, tamoxifen-inducible expression of TWIST1 promoted the Warburg metabolism of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment, we showed that TWIST1 can directly increase the expression of several glycolytic genes, including SLC2A1, HK2, ENO1, and PKM2. Of note, the transcriptional regulation by TWIST1 was not dependent on HIF1α or c-Myc. In The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus accession GSE15471, we confirmed that TWIST1 was closely associated with the glycolysis pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that TWIST1 is likely to act as important regulator of the Warburg effect in PDAC.

Abstract: Background
Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a common malignant tumor of the biliary system, but the current treatment of GBC is unsatisfactory. Therefore, new treatment targets and strategies are urgently needed.
Methods
The expression of HASPIN in GBC was detected by immunohistochemical staining. HASPIN knockdown cell model was constructed by lentivirus infection, and the infection efficiency of lentivirus and knockdown efficiency of shHASPIN were verified by fluorescence immunoassay, qRT-PCR and Western blot. The effects of HASPIN knockdown on cell proliferation, clone-formation ability and apoptosis were determined by MTT, clone formation assay, flow cytometry and Human Apoptosis Antibody Array in vitro. Besides, the effect of HASPIN knockdown on the growth of GBC solid tumors was demonstrated in vivo.
Results
The expression of HASPIN in GBC was up-regulated and positively correlated with the pathological grade of GBC. ShHASPIN significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of HASPIN, suggesting that HASPIN knockdown cell model was successfully constructed in vitro. After HASPIN knockdown, the proliferation and clone-formation ability of GBC cells were observably inhibited, the apoptotic levels were markedly increased, and the expression of Caspase 3, IGFBP-5, p21 and sTNF-R1 related to apoptotic pathway was up-regulated. Furthermore, HASPIN knockdown inhibited the growth of GBC in vivo.
Conclusion
HASPIN was up-regulated in GBC and played an important role in promoting the progress of GBC.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have emerged as a powerful platform for in vitro modelling of cardiac diseases, safety pharmacology and drug screening. All these applications require large quantities of well-characterised and standardised batches of hiPSC-CMs. Cryopreservation of hiPSC-CMs without affecting their biochemical or biophysical phenotype is essential for facilitating this, but ideally requires the cells being unchanged by the freeze-thaw procedure. We therefore compared the in vitro functional and molecular characteristics of fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs generated from multiple independent hiPSC lines. While the frozen hiPSC-CMs exhibited poorer replating than their freshly-derived counterparts, there was no difference in the proportion of cardiomyocytes retrieved from the mixed population when this was factored in, although for several lines a higher percentage of ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs were recovered following cryopreservation. Furthermore, cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs from one line exhibited longer action potential durations. These results provide evidence that cryopreservation does not compromise the in vitro molecular, physiological and mechanical properties of hiPSC-CMs, though can lead to an enrichment in ventricular myocytes. It also validates this procedure for storing hiPSC-CMs, thereby allowing the same batch of hiPSC-CMs to be used for multiple applications and evaluations.

Abstract: Activation of coagulation occurs in sepsis and contributes to the development of thrombosis. Platelet α-granule exocytosis plays an important role in septic coagulation abnormalities. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of exogenous carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide-releasing molecules II (CORM-2)-liberated CO, on suppressing platelet α-granule exocytosis in sepsis. It was shown that CORM-2 weakened α-granule membrane fusion with platelet plasma membrane and attenuated α-granule contents exocytosis in LPS-Induced platelet. Further studies revealed that CORM-2 suppressed the expression of integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets stimulated by LPS. This was accompanied by a decrease in production and phosphorylation of PKCθ and Munc18a, SNARE complex assembly and subsequently platelet α-granule exocytosis. Taken together, we suggested that the potential mechanism of suppressive effect of CORM-2 on LPS-induced platelet SNAREs complex assembly and α-Granule Exocytosis might involve integrin αIIbβ3-mediated PKCθ/Munc18a pathway activation.

Abstract: Physiological cyclic stretch (CS), caused by artery deformation following blood pressure, plays important roles in the homeostasis of endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we detected the effect of physiological CS on endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and their roles in leukocyte recruitment to ECs, which is a crucial event in EC inflammation. The results showed compared with the static treatment, pretreatment of 5%–CS–derived EMVs with ECs significantly decreased the adherence level of leukocytes. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed 373 proteins differentially expressed between static-derived and 5%–CS–derived EMVs, in which 314 proteins were uniquely identified in static-derived EMVs, 34 proteins uniquely in 5%–CS–derived EMVs, and 25 proteins showed obvious differences. Based on the proteomic data, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis predicted intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in EMVs might be the potential molecule involved in EC-leukocyte adhesion. Western blot and flow cytometry analyses confirmed the significant decrease of ICAM1 in 5%–CS–derived EMVs, which subsequently inhibited the phosphorylation of VE-cadherin at Tyr731 in target ECs. Moreover, leukocyte adhesion was obviously decreased after pretreatment with ICAM1 neutralizing antibody. Our present research suggested that physiological stretch changes the components of EMVs, which in turn inhibits leukocyte adhesion. ICAM1 expressed on CS-induced EMVs may play an important role in maintaining EC homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
We report detailed susceptibility profiling of asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to clinical and experimental antimalarials, combined with metabolomic fingerprinting. Results revealed a variety of stage-specific and metabolic profiles that differentiated the modes of action of clinical antimalarials including chloroquine, piperaquine, lumefantrine, and mefloquine, and identified late trophozoite-specific peak activity and stage-specific biphasic dose-responses for the mitochondrial inhibitors DSM265 and atovaquone. We also identified experimental antimalarials hitting previously unexplored druggable pathways as reflected by their unique stage specificity and/or metabolic profiles. These included several ring-active compounds, ones affecting hemoglobin catabolism through distinct pathways, and mitochondrial inhibitors with lower propensities for resistance than either DSM265 or atovaquone. This approach, also applicable to other microbes that undergo multiple differentiation steps, provides an effective tool to prioritize compounds for further development within the context of combination therapies.

Abstract: Summary
We have previously established a concept of developing exogenic pancreas in a genetically modified pig fetus with an apancreatic trait, thereby proposing the possibility of in vivo generation of functional human organs in xenogenic large animals. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a further proof-of-concept of the compensation for disabled organogeneses in pig, including pancreatogenesis, nephrogenesis, hepatogenesis, and vasculogenesis. These dysorganogenetic phenotypes could be efficiently induced via genome editing of the cloned pigs. Induced dysorganogenetic traits could also be compensated by allogenic blastocyst complementation, thereby proving the extended concept of organ regeneration from exogenous pluripotent cells in empty niches during various organogeneses. These results suggest that the feasibility of blastocyst complementation using genome-edited cloned embryos permits experimentation toward the in vivo organ generation in pigs from xenogenic pluripotent cells.

Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by lymphocytic microparticles via TLR4 pathway contributes to airway inflammation,

Abstract: The presence of elevated T lymphocytic microparticles (TLMPs) during respiratory illness is associated with airway and lung inflammation and epithelial injuries. Although inflammasome and IL-1β signaling are crucial in airway inflammation, little was known about their regulatory mechanism. We hypothesized that TLMPs trigger inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells to induce airway and lung inflammation. In this study, TLMPs induced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and upregulated TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in alveolar (A549) and human airway epithelial (16HBE) cells. Pretreatment with CLI-095, a specific inhibitor of TLR4 signaling, dramatically diminished the TLMP-induced release of IL-1β and IL-18 by inhibiting the formation of NLRP3/ASC/pro-caspase-1 inflammasome in a dose-dependent manner. The TLMP-induced autophagy inhibition in epithelial cells was dependent on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which significantly increased NLRP3 expression and enhanced TLMP-induced inflammation. TLR4, IL-1β, and IL-18 proteins harbored in TLMPs were nonessential for the pro-inflammatory effect. In conclusion, TLMPs induce bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines by activating the TLR4 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and inhibiting autophagy. These effects lead to NLRP3 inflammasome formation and accumulation. TLMPs may be regarded as deleterious markers of airway and lung damage in respiratory diseases.

Abstract: CHK1 and WEE1 play pivotal roles in G2/M checkpoint following exogenous DNA damage and regulation of DNA replication under normal cellular conditions. Here, we monitored and compared the cell cycle kinetics of mitosis-associated events after CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitor treatments in a human tongue cancer cell line (SAS). A fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) that reflects SCFSKP2 and APCCDH1 E3 ligase activities was used to monitor cell cycle progression. Numerous γH2AX-positive cells were observed within the S phase population of cells following CHK1 inhibitor treatment, and polyploid cells exhibiting DNA damage emerged via abortive mitosis (endomitosis) at 24 h post treatment. While WEE1 inhibitor-treated cells exhibited similar polyploidy via endomitosis at later time points, they possessed fewer γH2AX foci during S phase, and polyploid cells exhibiting DNA damage were scarce. Instead, mitosis duration greatly extended and was accompanied by an abnormal emission of Fucci red fluorescence. Kinetic analysis of Fucci fluorescence revealed that abnormal emission occurred at early M phase in a manner independent of green fluorescence degradation as a marker of APCCDH1 activation. When an inhibitor of the essential spindle checkpoint factor MPS1 was co-treated with a WEE1 inhibitor, the elongated mitosis duration and abnormal red fluorescence were abrogated, and WEE1-induced reduction of clonogenic survival was offset. We demonstrate novel differential effects on mitosis-associated events following CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitor treatments.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offer a promising tool for regenerative medicine. The clinical application of PSCs inevitably requires a large-scale culture in a highly defined environment. The present study aimed to devise defined coating materials for the efficient adhesion and proliferation of human PSCs (hPSCs). We tested the activity of seven fibronectin-derived peptides and three laminin-derived peptides for the attachment and proliferation of hPSCs through their immobilization on the bottom of culture dishes by creating a fusion protein with the mussel adhesion protein. Among the extracellular matrix (ECM) mimetics tested, one fibronectin-derived peptide, PHSRN-GRGDSP, significantly promoted adhesion, enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity, and increased pluripotency-related gene expression in hPSCs compared to Matrigel. Furthermore, co-immobilization of a particular canofin peptide derived from fibroblast growth factor 2 increased pluripotency marker expression, which may offer the possibility of culture without growth factor supplementation. Our findings afford a novel defined condition for the efficient culture of hPSCs and may be utilized in future clinical applications.

Abstract: Recent studies revealed that macrophages are polarized towards the M2 phenotype in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic model. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are immune barriers in alveoli to various pathogens in the respiratory tract; AMs suppress Th2 cell proliferation, inhibit interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion, and protect against airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic asthma. However, the polarization status and effects of different types of AMs in the pathogenesis of asthma are not known. ATP/P2X7r, expressed mainly on macrophages and dendritic cells, is associated with acute and chronic asthmatic airway inflammation and Th2 immune responses in mice and humans and functions by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome complex and inducing proinflammatory cytokine release (IL-1β and IL-18). Therefore, we evaluated the association between the ATP/P2X7r axis and different types of AMs in the pathology of allergic asthma. A murine AM-depleted asthma model was established by administration of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes, and M1-or M2-AMs were adoptively transferred to confirm the effects of different AMs in allergic asthma. Brilliant Blue G and BzATP were administered to OVA/HDM-induced mice in vivo. Lipopolysaccharide + OVA, ATP, Brilliant Blue G, and BzATP were used to stimulate AMs isolated from control and asthmatic mice. We found that selective depletion of AMs aggravated lung inflammation in asthmatic mice. Further, M2-type AMs may play a key role in mediating asthmatic inflammatory responses via the adoptive transfer of M2-type AMs to AM-depleted asthmatic mice, and the phenotype of AMs differentiated to M2 type in asthma. P2X7r expression in M2-type AMs was higher than that in M1-type AMs. Activating P2X7r induced polarization of M2-type AMs and inhibited polarization of M1-type AMs, while blockage of P2X7r had the opposite effect. The ATP/P2X7r axis may participate in the pathogenesis of asthma by mediating the M2-type AM polarization.

Abstract: Although there have been reports of promising results regarding the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for neurodegenerative diseases through the use of neuronal differentiation or control of the microenvironment, traditional surgical transplantation methods like parenchymal or intravenous injection have limitations such as secondary injuries in the brain, infection, and low survival rate of stem cells in the target site. Focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment is an emerging modality for the treatment of brain diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. The various biological effects of FUS treatment have been investigated; therefore, the goal is now to improve the delivery efficiency and function of MSCs by capitalizing on the advantages of FUS. In this study, we demonstrated that FUS increases MSC transplantation into brain tissue by >2-fold, and that this finding might be related to the activation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial and subendothelial cells and vascular adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells.

Abstract: The rare gestational trophoblastic neoplasia placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) frequently demonstrates a high degree of vascularization, which may facilitate the tumor metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, we found that early growth response 1 (EGR1) was highly expressed in the carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of PSTT tissues. Further data showed that miR-363 down-regulated EGR1 expression whereas long non-coding RNA NONHSAT003875 (lnc003875) up-regulated EGR1 expression in PSTT derived CAFs. lnc003875 exerted no effect on miR-363 expression, but it recovered the decrease of EGR1 caused by miR-363 mimic. The conditioned media from PSTT CAFs treated with miR-363 mimic abrogated the tube formation capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which can be partially restored by lnc003875 over-expression. Moreover, over-expression of EGR1 promoted the secretion of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in PSTT derived CAFs and improved the tube formation of HUVECs, which could be effectively abrogated by Ang-1 siRNAs. In vivo vasculogenesis assay demonstrated that lnc003875/EGR1 in PSTT derived CAFs promoted the vasculogenesis of HUVECs in C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that lnc003875/miR-363/EGR1/Ang-1 in CAFs may be crucial for the angiogenesis of PSTT.

Abstract: Summary
Proprotein convertase substilisin-like/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in a protein-protein interaction with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor that has both human genetic and clinical validation. Blocking this protein-protein interaction prevents LDL receptor degradation and thereby decreases LDL cholesterol levels. Our pursuit of small-molecule direct binders for this difficult to drug PPI target utilized affinity selection/mass spectrometry, which identified one confirmed hit compound. An X-ray crystal structure revealed that this compound was binding in an unprecedented allosteric pocket located between the catalytic and C-terminal domain. Optimization of this initial hit, using two distinct strategies, led to compounds with high binding affinity to PCSK9. Direct target engagement was demonstrated in the cell lysate with a cellular thermal shift assay. Finally, ligand-induced protein degradation was shown with a proteasome recruiting tag attached to the high-affinity allosteric ligand for PCSK9.

Abstract: Background
The molecular mechanisms of abnormal palatogenesis were investigated in this study. A key regulator, miR-106a-5p, and its target pathway were analyzed.
Objectives
This research is trying to clarify the underlying mechanism of the modulation of miRNA transcription during the formation of cleft palate by 7T and 9.4T NMR metabolomic platforms.
Method
Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and verified by qRT-PCR. The protein expression in TGFβ signaling pathways were analyzed by Western Blotting. The relationship between miR-106a-5p and TGFβ were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. Cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometer. And finally, the metabonomics were analyzed by NMR and multivariate data analysis models (MVDA).
Results
The expression of miR-106a-5p increased in cleft palatal tissue and negatively correlated with the protein level of Tgfbr2. The luciferase assay further proved that the tgfbr2 was a direct target of miR-106a-5p. In another aspect, miR-106a-5p increased apoptosis level in palatal mesenchymal cells, possibly because its inhibition of TGFβ signaling pathway. Moreover, low cholesterol and choline levels with high citric acid and lipid levels were observed by 7T and 9.4T NMR metabonomic analysis, which inferred the disorder of cell membrane synthesis in cleft palate formation. Furthermore, transformation from choline to phosphatidylcholine regulated by miR-106a-5p was also disrupted, resulting in phosphatidic choline synthesis disorder and reduced cell membrane synthesis.
Conclusions
The regulatory mechanism of cleft palate was studied at transcriptional and metabolomics levels, which may provide important information in understanding the primary cause of this abnormality.

Abstract: Summary
A common strategy for multi-protein expression is to link genes by self-cleaving 2A peptide sequences. Yet, little is known how the 2A peptide-derived N-terminal proline or adjacent non-native residues introduced during cDNA cloning affects protein stoichiometry. Polycistronic reprogramming constructs with altered KLF4 protein stoichiometry can influence induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. We studied the impact of N-terminal 2A peptide-adjacent residues on the protein stability of two KLF4 isoforms, and assayed their capacity to generate iPSCs. Here, we show that the N-terminal proline remnant of the 2A peptide, alone or in combination with leucine, introduced during polycistronic cloning, destabilizes KLF4 resulting in increased protein degradation, which hinders reprogramming. Interestingly, the addition of charged and hydrophilic amino acids, such as glutamate or lysine stabilizes KLF4, enhancing reprogramming phenotypes. These findings raise awareness that N-terminal modification with 2A peptide-derived proline or additional cloning conventions may affect protein stability within polycistronic constructs.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is closely associated with profound vascular remodeling, especially pulmonary arterial medial hypertrophy and muscularization, due to aberrant proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Berberine, a drug commonly used to treat inflammation, may be a novel therapeutic option for PAH by improving pulmonary artery remodeling. The present study investigated whether berberine affected Trx1/β-catenin expression and/or activity and whether it could reduce the development of pulmonary hypertension in an experimental rat model and proliferation in human PASMCs (HPASMCs). The results showed that increased proliferation in hypoxia-induced healthy PASMCs or PAH PASMCs was associated with a significant increase in Trx1 and β-catenin expression. Treatment with the Trx1-specific inhibitor PX-12 significantly reduced pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular remodeling, as well as improved in vivo cardiac function and right ventricular hypertrophy, in Su/Hox-induced PAH rats. Berberine reversed right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy and decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling in the rats. Furthermore, berberine had an antiproliferative effect on hypoxia-induced HPASMC proliferation in a manner likely mediated by inhibiting Trx1 and its target gene β-catenin expression. Our work will help elucidate novel strategies for PAH treatment involving the traditional Chinese medicine berberine, and Trx1/β-catenin may be a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: Aggregation of α-Synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these α-Synuclein inclusions are not only present in brain, but also in gut. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are directly exposed to the gut lumen, can express α-Synuclein and directly connect to α-Synuclein-containing nerves. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) has been implicated as a driver for PD. Butyrate is an SCFA produced by the gut microbiota. Our aim was to demonstrate how α-Synuclein expression in EECs responds to butyrate stimulation. Interestingly, we found that sodium butyrate (NaB) increases α-Synuclein mRNA expression, enhances Atg5-mediated autophagy (increased LC3B-II and decreased SQSTM1 (also known as p62) expression) in murine neuroendocrine STC-1 cells. Further, α-Synuclein mRNA was decreased by the inhibition of autophagy by using inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or by silencing Atg5 with siRNA. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was activated by NaB. Conditioned media from NaB-stimulated STC-1 cells induced inflammation in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, NaB causes α-Synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient nutrient acquisition in the human gut is essential for microbial persistence. Although polysaccharides have been well-studied nutrients for the gut microbiome, other resources such as nucleic acids and nucleosides are less studied. We describe several ribose-utilization systems (RUSs) that are broadly represented in Bacteroidetes and appear to have diversified to access ribose from a variety of substrates. One Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron RUS variant is critical for competitive gut colonization in a diet-specific fashion. We used molecular genetics to probe the required functions of the system and the nature of the nutrient source(s) underlying this phenotype. Two RUS-encoded ribokinases were the only components required for this effect, presumably because they generate ribose-phosphate derivatives from products of an unlinked but essential nucleoside phosphorylase. Our results underscore the extensive mechanisms that gut symbionts have evolved to access nutrients and the potential for unexpected dependencies among systems that mediate colonization and persistence.

Abstract: The receptor tyrosine kinase MET plays a vital role in skeletal muscle development and in postnatal muscle regeneration. However, the effect of MET on myogenesis of myoblasts has not yet been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MET on myogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Decreased myonuclei and down-regulated expression of myogenesis-related markers were observed in Met p.Y1232C mutant heterozygous mice. To explore the effects of MET on myoblast proliferation and differentiation, Met was overexpressed or interfered in C2C12 myoblast cells through the lentiviral transfection. The Met overexpression cells exhibited promotion in myoblast proliferation, while the Met deficiency cells showed impediment in proliferation. Moreover, myoblast differentiation was enhanced by the stable Met overexpression, but was impaired by Met deficiency. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that SU11274, an inhibitor of MET kinase activity, suppressed myoblast differentiation, suggesting that MET regulated the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) and of desmin through the classical tyrosine kinase pathway. On the basis of the above findings, our work confirmed that MET promoted the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, deepening our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle development.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulation of the PRC2 complex, comprised of the core subunits EZH2, SUZ12, and EED, drives aberrant hypermethylation of H3K27 and tumorigenicity of many cancers. Although inhibitors of EZH2 have shown promising clinical activity, preclinical data suggest that resistance can be acquired through secondary mutations in EZH2 that abrogate drug target engagement. To address these limitations, we have designed several hetero-bifunctional PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimera) to efficiently target EED for elimination. Our PROTACs bind to EED (pKD ∼ 9.0) and promote ternary complex formation with the E3 ubiquitin ligase. The PROTACs potently inhibit PRC2 enzyme activity (pIC50 ∼ 8.1) and induce rapid degradation of not only EED but also EZH2 and SUZ12 within the PRC2 complex. Furthermore, the PROTACs selectively inhibit proliferation of PRC2-dependent cancer cells (half maximal growth inhibition [GI50] = 49–58 nM). In summary, our data demonstrate a therapeutic modality to target PRC2-dependent cancer through a PROTAC-mediated degradation mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Biological membranes are complex barriers in which membrane proteins and thousands of lipidic species participate in structural and functional interactions. Developing a strategic approach that allows uniform labeling of membrane proteins while maintaining a lipidic environment that retains functional interactions is highly desirable for in vitro fluorescence studies. Herein, we focus on complementing current methods by integrating the powerful processes of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, bioorthogonal labeling, and the detergent-free membrane protein solubilization based on the amphiphilic styrene-maleic acid (SMA) polymer. Importantly, the SMA polymer preserves a thermodynamically stable shell of phospholipids. The approach that we present is both rapid and generalizable providing a population of uniquely labeled membrane proteins in lipid nanoparticles for quantitative fluorescence-based studies.

Abstract: Human heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) is an autoantigen involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Epitopes derived from HSP60 can trigger activation of regulatory T cells (Treg). CIGB-814 is an altered peptide ligand (APL) derived from HSP60. In preclinical models, this peptide had anti-inflammatory effects and increased Treg. The results from phase I clinical trial indicated that CIGB-814 was safe and activated mechanisms associated with induction of tolerance. Biodistribution profile for inducers of tolerance is crucial for triggering its effects. The primary goal of this study in Lewis rats was to identify (1) the target organs of CIGB-814 and (2) the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile. 125I-CIGB-814 administered subcutaneously at three dose levels was distributed in the thyroid gland, but also at considerable levels to the stomach and small and large intestines. In addition, concentration of CIGB-814 was increased in lymph nodes (LNs) at 24 h, compared with 4-h post-administration. Small intestine and LNs are excellent sites for induction of tolerance, due to the characteristics of dendritic cells in these tissues. Maximum concentration of CIGB-814 in blood of Lewis rats at 0.5 to 1 h agrees with PK profile determined for patients. Altogether, these results support therapeutic possibilities of CIGB-814 for RA.

Abstract: Successful implantation happens only when the development of a competent blastocyst synchronized with the differentiation of a receptive uterus. The exact mechanism affecting embryo implantation competency is still unclear. Previous data from our laboratory showed that several members of the let-7 family were up-regulated in the implanting dormant blastocysts and prohibited embryo activation through down-regulation integrin-β3. However, how the mir-let-7 family is regulated is still a question. In this study, the in vitro co-culture model was applied to imitate implantation. Human embryo surrogate Jeg-3 spheroids and endometrium epithelial cells Ishikawa were used. The following views were demonstrated. Firstly，Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for Jeg-3 spheroids implantation. Secondly, mir-let-7a is repressed by Wnt signaling, and low let-7a is beneficial for spheroids attachment and outgrowth. Third, in contrast with let-7a, lin28a is up-regulated by Wnt and promotes attachment and outgrowth. Lastly, the function of Wnt in embryo surrogate spheroids in implantation is mediated through lin28a/let-7a axis. In summary, our findings suggest Wnt/β-catenin signaling strength human embryo surrogate spheroids implanting potential through regulation lin28a/let-7a axis.

Abstract: Summary
Stunting, a severe and multigenerational growth impairment, globally affects 22% of children under the age of 5 years. Stunted children have altered gut bacterial communities with higher proportions of Proteobacteria, a phylum with several known human pathogens. Despite the links between an altered gut microbiota and stunting, the role of bacteriophages, highly abundant bacterial viruses, is unknown. Here, we describe the gut bacterial and bacteriophage communities of Bangladeshi stunted children younger than 38 months. We show that these children harbor distinct gut bacteriophages relative to their non-stunted counterparts. In vitro, these gut bacteriophages are infectious and can regulate bacterial abundance and composition in an age-specific manner, highlighting their possible role in the pathophysiology of child stunting. Specifically, Proteobacteria from non-stunted children increased in the presence of phages from younger stunted children, suggesting that phages could contribute to the bacterial community changes observed in child stunting.

Abstract: The eye imaginal disc-specific knockdown of dFIG4, a Drosophila homolog of FIG4 that is one of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)-causing genes, induces an aberrant adult compound eye morphology, the so-called rough eye phenotype. We previously performed modifier screening on the dFIG4 knockdown-induced rough eye phenotype and identified several genes, including CR18854, encoding a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as genetic interactants with dFIG4. In the present study, in more extensive genetic screening, we found that the deletion of a gene locus encoding both Odorant rector 46a (Or46a) and lncRNA CR43467 effectively suppressed the rough eye phenotype induced by the knockdown of dFIG4. Both genes were located on the same locus, but oriented in opposite directions. In order to identify which of these genes is responsible for the suppression of the rough eye phenotype, we established a CR43467-specific knockdown line using the CRISPR-dCas9 system. By using this system, we demonstrated that the CR43467 gene, but not the Or46a gene, genetically interacted with the dFIG4 gene. The knockdown of CR43467 rescued the reductions in the length of synaptic branches and number of boutons at neuromuscular junctions induced by the knockdown of dFIG4. The vacuole enlargement phenotype induced by the fat body-specific dFIG4 knockdown was also effectively suppressed by the knockdown of CR43467. The knockdown of CR43467 also suppressed the rough eye phenotype induced by other peripheral neuropathy-related genes, such as dCOA7, dHADHB, and dPDHB. We herein identified another gene encoding lncRNA, CR43467 as a genetic interactant with the CMT-causing gene.

Abstract: Lysyl oxidase like 2, LOXL2, as a member of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family, has been shown to function similarly to LOX in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by promoting crosslinking of collagen and elastin. LOXL2 is also engaged to transcription regulation, cell signaling transduction and cell adhesion regulation. It has been reported that LOXL2 is highly expressed in several types of tumors and promotes cell proliferation and migration in various cancer cells. However, the regulatory mechanism of LOXL2 expression remains largely unknown. To further investigate its transcriptional regulatory mechanism, LOXL2 promoter region has been cloned and identified in the present study. Chromatin state analysis revealed that LOXL2 gene locus contained an active promoter near its first exon. We then constructed five different LOXL2 gene promoter luciferase reporter constructs covering 1.7 kb upstream of LOXL2 gene transcription initiation site. Series luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that all the five constructs showed notable promoter activity, and LOXL2 core promoter was located in a region of 185 bp near the transcription initiation site. Transcriptional factor binding analysis indicated that, LOXL2 promoter lacked classical TATA box, but contained putative binding sites for classic transcriptional factors such as Sp1 and NF-κB. Ectopic overexpression of Sp1 significantly enhanced LOXL2 promoter activity as well as its endogenous expression in cells. In contrast, mithramycin A (a selective Sp1 inhibitor) treatment repressed LOXL2 promoter as well as its endogenous transcription. Site directed mutagenesis assay further confirmed that the Sp1 binding sites were essential for proximal prompter activity of LOXL2 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that Sp1 bound LOXL2 promoter in vivo. Of note, the expression of Sp1 and LOXL2 are positively correlated, and the higher expression of LOXL2 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, strongly suggesting the implication of Sp1-mediated LOXL2 transactivation in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture conditions are often used to promote the differentiation of human cells as a prerequisite for the study of organotypic functions and environment-specific cellular responses. Here, we assessed the molecular and functional phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) cultured as 3D multilayered aggregates. Microarray studies revealed that these conditions decrease the expression of genes associated with cell cycle control and DNA replication and cease proliferation of VSMCs. This was accompanied by a lower activity level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 and an increase in autocrine TGFβ/SMAD2/3-mediated signaling – a determinant of VSMC differentiation. However, inhibition of TGFβ signaling did not affect markers of VSMC differentiation such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH11) but stimulated pro-inflammatory NFκB-associated gene expression in the first place while decreasing the protein level of NFKB1/p105 and NFKB2/p100 - inhibitors of NFκB transcriptional activity. Moreover, loss of TGFβ signaling also revived VSMC proliferation in 3D aggregates. In conclusion, assembly of VSMCs in multilayered aggregates alters their transcriptome to translate the cellular organization into a resting phenotype. In this context, TGFβ signaling appears to attenuate cell growth and NFκB-controlled gene expression representing important aspects of VSMC quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
Polo-like kinase 1 has hundreds of substrates and multiple functions that operate within the ∼60 min of mitosis. Herein, we describe a chemical-genetic system that allows particular substrates to be “toggled” into or out of chemical control using engineered phosphoacceptor selectivity. Biochemical assays and phosphoproteomic analysis of mitotic cell extracts showed that Plk1S (L197F) and Plk1T (L197S/L211A) selectively phosphorylate Ser and Thr, respectively. Plk1S but not Plk1T sustains mitotic progression to anaphase, affording the opportunity to toggle substrate residues between Ser and Thr to place them under chemical control. Using this system, we evaluated Kif2b, a known substrate of Plk1 that regulates chromosome alignment. Toggling Ser to Thr on Kif2b places these phosphorylation sites under reversible chemical control, as indicated by a sharp increase in the frequency of misaligned chromosomes and prometaphase arrest. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to chemically control a single substrate by a genetic Ser/Thr toggle.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons constitute between 15% and 20% of the genome. Although only a few copies have retained the ability to retrotranspose, evidence in brain and differentiating pluripotent cells indicates that L1 retrotransposition occurs and creates mosaics in normal somatic tissues. The function of de novo insertions remains to be understood. The transdifferentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to dopaminergic neuronal fate provides a suitable model for studying L1 dynamics in a defined genomic and unaltered epigenomic background. We found that L1 elements are specifically re-expressed and mobilized during the initial stages of reprogramming and that their insertions into specific acceptor loci coincides with higher chromatin accessibility and creation of new transcribed units. Those events accompany the maturation of neuronal committed cells. We conclude that L1 retrotransposition is a non-random process correlating with chromatin opening and lncRNA production that accompanies direct somatic cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Evolutionary developmental biology of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), is essential for understanding the origin of human traits. However, it is difficult to access developmental events in the chimpanzee in vivo because of technical and ethical restrictions. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an alternative in vitro model system to investigate developmental events by overcoming the limitations of in vivo study. Here, we generated chimpanzee iPSCs from adult skin fibroblasts and reconstructed early neural development using in vitro differentiation culture conditions. Chimpanzee iPSCs were established using straightforward methods, namely, lipofection of plasmid vectors carrying human reprogramming factors, combined with maintenance in a comprehensive feeder-free culture. Ultimately, direct neurosphere formation culture induced rapid and efficient differentiation of neural stem cells from chimpanzee iPSCs. Time course analysis of neurosphere formation demonstrated ontogenetic changes in gene expression profiles and developmental potency along an early neural development path from epiblasts to radial glia. Our iPSC culture system is a potent tool for investigating the molecular and cellular foundation underlying chimpanzee early neural development and better understanding of human brain evolution.

Abstract: Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) transferred between cells have been implicated in modulating the host immune response in microbial infections. In this study, we isolated exosomes from Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum)-stimulated macrophages and detected differential exosomal miRNA expression using both microarrays, and RT-qPCR. A total of 65 differentially expressed miRNAs (35 upregulated and 30 downregulated) were identified. Of all identiﬁed miRNAs, miR-146a-5p was one of the most signiﬁcantly changed miRNAs with high expression in exosomes from T. pallidum-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, we isolated plasma exosomes from early syphilis patients and healthy controls, and confirmed miR-146a-5p upregulation in the former group. We also show that exosomal miR-146a-5p is efficiently transported into endothelial cells, reducing monocyte transendothelial migration and endothelial permeability by targeting junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C). Luciferase reporter assays confirmed binding of exosomal miR-146a-5p to the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of JAM-C. We then demonstrated that also exosomes derived from macrophages stimulated by T. pallidum expressed high levels of miR-146a-5p which could be delivered to endothelial cells, and decreased monocyte transendothelial migration by targeting JAM-C. Overall, this work provides novel insights into the mechanism by which T. pallidum hampers inflammatory reactions of the host via a blockade of leukocytes transendothelial migration and endothelial permeability.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene found in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. Although it has been challenging to identify targeted therapies for cancers harboring KRAS mutations, KRASG12C can be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors that form covalent bonds with cysteine 12 (C12). Here, we designed a library of C12-directed covalent degrader molecules (PROTACs) and subjected them to a rigorous evaluation process to rapidly identify a lead compound. Our lead degrader successfully engaged CRBN in cells, bound KRASG12C in vitro, induced CRBN/KRASG12C dimerization, and degraded GFP-KRASG12C in reporter cells in a CRBN-dependent manner. However, it failed to degrade endogenous KRASG12C in pancreatic and lung cancer cells. Our data suggest that inability of the lead degrader to effectively poly-ubiquitinate endogenous KRASG12C underlies the lack of activity. We discuss challenges for achieving targeted KRASG12C degradation and proposed several possible solutions which may lead to efficient degradation of endogenous KRASG12C.

Abstract: Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) is initiated by mechanical force and featured as alveolar bone remodeling. Periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) are one of the major cell components in periodontium and responsible for the signal transduction during OTM. Up to now, the mechanical stress-induced genetic alteration and mechanotransduction mechanisms in PDLCs still remain not fully understood. In this study, we identified a novel compressive force responsive gene, Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), whose expression transcriptionally increased in human periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) after exposure to the static compressive force in vitro. Functional analyses proved that GDF15 could promote osteoclast differentiation of the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells. Molecular investigation uncovered that GDF15 could promote the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and RANKL/OPG ratio in PDLCs, while knockdown of GDF15 impaired their upregulation induced by compressive force. Additionally, administration of recombinant GDF15 protein stimulated the M1-like polarization of RAW264.7 cells and THP-1 induced macrophages. Mechanistically, siRNA-mediated suppression of GDF15 significantly disrupted the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and ERK phosphorylation in response to compressive force. Finally, Yes-associated protein (YAP) was demonstrated to be the upstream regulator of GDF15 in human PDLCs, implying a force-induced YAP-GDF15 regulation mechanism. Overall, these data suggested important roles of GDF15 in the functional modulation of both PDLCs and osteoclast progenitors in response to compressive force, providing novel insights into the molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction during OTM process.

Abstract: Summary
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare disorder caused by a point mutation in the Lamin A gene that produces the protein progerin. Progerin toxicity leads to accelerated aging and death from cardiovascular disease. To elucidate the effects of progerin on endothelial cells, we prepared tissue-engineered blood vessels (viTEBVs) using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived smooth muscle cells (viSMCs) and endothelial cells (viECs) from HGPS patients. HGPS viECs aligned with flow but exhibited reduced flow-responsive gene expression and altered NOS3 levels. Relative to viTEBVs with healthy cells, HGPS viTEBVs showed reduced function and exhibited markers of cardiovascular disease associated with endothelium. HGPS viTEBVs exhibited a reduction in both vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Preparing viTEBVs with HGPS viECs and healthy viSMCs only reduced vasodilation. Furthermore, HGPS viECs produced VCAM1 and E-selectin protein in TEBVs with healthy or HGPS viSMCs. In summary, the viTEBV model has identified a role of the endothelium in HGPS.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a common endocrine malignancy with an increasing occurrence and recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely acknowledged to be participated in human cancers. However, how these miRNAs exert roles and potential mechanisms in PTC regulatory networks is still lacking. The purpose of our study lies in discovering the regulatory basis of miR-200b/c and Rap1b for PTC tumorigenesis and malignant progression, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Herein, miR-200b/c expression was sharply dropped and Rap1b expression was up-regulated in PTC cells and tissues samples when compared to normal thyroid epithelial cells and normal tissues. miR-200b/c targeted Rap1 directly and negatively regulated its expression. miR-200b/c overexpression suppressed proliferative, colony forming, migratory and invasive capabilities and EMT as well as elevated apoptosis of PTC cells through inhibiting Rap1b. Furthermore, xenograft experiments showed miR-200b/c overexpression constrained growth of PTC xenograft and EMT. miR-200b/c inhibited NF-κB/Twist1 signals via regulating the Rap1b expression in cells and animal models. Taken together, our study suggested that upregulation of miR-200b/c-RAP1B axis constrained PTC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT. Also, the upregulation of miR-200b/c-RAP1B leaded to elevated apoptosis through inhibiting the NF-κB/Twist1 pathway, thus inhibiting PTC tumorigenesis and malignant progression.

Abstract: Mucosal hyperplasia is common sequela of otitis media (OM), leading to the secretion of mucus and the recruitment of leukocytes. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying hyperplasia are not well defined. Here, we investigated the role of the AKT pathway in the development of middle mucosal hyperplasia using in vitro mucosal explants cultures and an in vivo rat model. The Akt inhibitor MK2206 treatment inhibited the growth of middle ear mucosal explants in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, MK2206 also reduced mucosal hyperplasia. Unexpectedly, while PTEN is generally thought to act in opposition to AKT, the PTEN inhibitor BPV reduced mucosal explant growth in vitro. The results indicate that both AKT and PTEN are mediators of mucosal growth during OM, and could be potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common childhood illness primarily caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), for which there are no current vaccines or treatments. We identify three CVA16-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) with therapeutic potential: 18A7, 14B10, and NA9D7. We present atomic structures of these nAbs bound to all three viral particle forms—the mature virion, A-particle, and empty particle—and show that each Fab can simultaneously occupy the mature virion. Additionally, 14B10 or NA9D7 provide 100% protection against lethal CVA16 infection in a neonatal mouse model. 18A7 binds to a non-conserved epitope present in all three particles, whereas 14B10 and NA9D7 recognize broad protective epitopes but only bind the mature virion. NA9D7 targets an immunodominant site, which may overlap the receptor-binding site. These findings indicate that CVA16 vaccines should be based on mature virions and that these antibodies could be used to discriminate optimal virion-based immunogens.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few miRNAs have been identified and entered clinical practice. Herein, we report that miR-29a is downregulated in tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) and has an important function in liver T-ICs. Functional studies revealed that miR-29a knockdown promotes liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Conversely, a forced miR-29a expression inhibits liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we find that miR-29a downregulates Bcl-2 via binding its mRNA 3′UTR in liver T-ICs. The correlation between miR-29a and Bcl-2 is validated in human HCC tissues. Furthermore, the miR-29a expression determines the responses of hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. Analysis of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further demonstrated that the miR-29a high patients are more sensitive to sorafenib treatment. In conclusion, our findings revealed the crucial role of the miR-29a in liver T-ICs expansion and sorafenib response, rendering miR-29a as an optimal target for the prevention and intervention of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) therapy offers significant potential for osteochondral regeneration. Such applications require their ex vivo expansion in media frequently supplemented with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Particular heparan sulfate (HS) fractions stabilize FGF2-FGF receptor complexes. We show that an FGF2-binding HS variant (HS8) accelerates the expansion of freshly isolated bone marrow hMSCs without compromising their naivety. Importantly, the repair of osteochondral defects in both rats and pigs is improved after treatment with HS8-supplemented hMSCs (MSCHS8), when assessed histologically, biomechanically, or by MRI. Thus, supplementing hMSC culture media with an HS variant that targets endogenously produced FGF2 allows the elimination of exogenous growth factors that may adversely affect their therapeutic potency.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is a well-known transcription factor associated with podocyte injury and fibrosis. Recently, hypertensive nephropathy was discovered to be closely related to podocyte injury and fibrosis. However, methods to stimulate hypertension in vitro are lacking. Here, we constructed an in vitro model mimicking hypertension using a rotational force device to identify the role of KLF15 in fibrosis due to mechanically induced hypertensive injury. First, we found that KLF15 expression was decreased in patients with hypertensive nephropathy. Then, an in vitro study of hypertension due to rotational force was conducted, and an increase in fibrosis markers and decrease in KLF15 levels were determined after application of 4 mmHg pressure in primary cultured human podocytes. KLF15 and tight junction protein levels increased with retinoic acid treatment. siRNA-mediated inhibition of KLF15 exacerbated pressure-induced fibrosis injury, and KLF15 expression after treatment with angiotensin II was similar to that observed after treatment with the blood pressure modeling device. Furthermore, the reduced KLF15 levels after mechanical pressure application were restored after the administration of an antihypertensive drug. KLF15 expression was also low in vivo. We confirmed the protective role of KLF15 in fibrosis using a mechanically induced in vitro model of hypertensive injury.

Abstract: Stroke is a leading global cause of mortality and disability. However, the pathogenesis that contributes to stroke has not been fully understood. The tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing proteins usually exhibit essential regulatory roles during various biological processes. TRIM8 is a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing crucial roles in regulating inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study, we reported that TRIM8 expression was significantly induced in the peri-infarct cortex area of mice after stroke onset. TRIM8 siRNA in vivo transfection resulted in the attenuated cognitive impairments in mice with cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In addition, TRIM8 knockdown was neuroprotective, as evidenced by the reduced infarct area, decreased neurological deficit score and down-regulated number of TUNEL-positive cells in the peri-infarct area. Moreover, TRIM8 inhibition obviously repressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in peri-hematoma cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, inflammation induced by cerebral IR injury was highly restrained by TRIM8 knockdown in serum, peri-infarct area and hippocampus, which were along with the remarkable decreases in the phosphorylated expression of IκB kinase alpha (IKKα), inhibitory κB α (IκBα) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, TRIM8 knockdown significantly reduced apoptosis in hippocampus of mice with cerebral IR injury by reducing Caspase-3 cleavage. The in vitro experiment confirmed the neuroprotective role of TRIM8-knockdown in regulating cerebral IR injury. Intriguingly, we found that TRIM8 over-expression-promoted inflammatory response and apoptosis could be markedly attenuated by the inactivation of NF-κB signaling through pre-treatment of JSH-23 or QNZ in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-incubated astrocytes (ASTs). Therefore, TRIM8 positively regulated cerebral IR injury by activating NF-κB pathway to enhance inflammation and apoptosis. Targeting TRIM8 could provide feasible therapeutic treatment for stroke.

Abstract: The noble scallop Chlamys nobilis is an economically important marine bivalve cultivated in the southern sea of China since the 1980s. Unfortunately, mass mortality of this scallop species often occurs in summer. The present study was conducted to investigate whether the expression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and level of carotenoids could enhance high-temperature stress resistance in scallop. First, the HSP90 homolog of C. nobilis (designated CnHSP90) was identified and cloned. The complete cDNA sequence of CnHSP90 was 2631 bp, including a 2181-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 726 amino acid polypeptide with five HSP90 family signatures, and sharing high homology with members of the HSP90 family. CnHSP90 was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues including the intestine, kidney, adductor, mantle, gill, and gonad, with the highest in the gonad. Golden and brown scallops, which contain significantly different total carotenoid content (TCC), were subjected to acute thermal challenge, and the LTE50 (semi-lethal temperature at 36 h heat shock) and LTI50 (semi-lethal time after heat shock) as well as the correlation between CnHSP90 gene expression and TCC were determined. The LTE50 of golden scallop (32.14 °C) was higher than that of brown scallops (31.19 °C), with longer LTI50 at all tested temperatures, indicating that golden scallops were more resistant to thermal stress than brown scallops. Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of CnHSP90 in gill of golden scallops were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of brown scallops at 6, 12, 24, and 36 h, with a strong positive correlation between CnHSP90 expression level and TCC. This suggests that both carotenoids and HSP90 levels could improve thermal resistance in the noble scallops.

Abstract: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma associated with lichen sclerosus (VLS-VSCC) are rare tumors but with higher recurrence and worse prognosis than other types of VSCC. Lack of experimental models has limited the search for better understanding of the biology and development of treatment modalities. In this study, we isolated and characterized primary cells from VSCC (n = 7) and normal vulvar tissue adjacent to tumor (n = 7). Detailed characterization of the novel spontaneously immortalized cell line, VCC1 revealed a characteristic epithelial morphology in vitro and a well-differentiated keratinizing SCC histology in vivo, closely resembling the tumor of origin. VCC1 expressed higher levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and higher clonogenic properties as compared to other established non VLS-VSCC cell lines. In vitro 3D organotypic assays and in vivo xenografts revealed a prominent role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in VCC1 invasion and tumor formation. In conclusion, VCC1 mirrored several major VLS-VSCC features and provided a robust experimental tool for further elucidation of VLS-related oncogenesis and drug testing.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone, essential for cellular survival under diverse environments. Since this protein is employed by tumors to promote their prevalence, heat shock protein 90 inhibitors have been developed to oppose malignancies. The anti-cancer effects of those compounds appear to be associated with anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, ongoing laborious efforts investigate the possible application of those agents towards inflammatory disorders of the lungs, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Many intracellular bacteria can establish chronic infection and persist in tissues within granulomas composed of macrophages. Granuloma macrophages exhibit heterogeneous polarization states, or phenotypes, that may be functionally distinct. Here, we elucidate a host-pathogen interaction that controls granuloma macrophage polarization and long-term pathogen persistence during Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) infection. We show that STm persists within splenic granulomas that are densely populated by CD11b+CD11c+Ly6C+ macrophages. STm preferentially persists in granuloma macrophages reprogrammed to an M2 state, in part through the activity of the effector SteE, which contributes to the establishment of persistent infection. We demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling limits M2 granuloma macrophage polarization, thereby restricting STm persistence. TNF neutralization shifts granuloma macrophages toward an M2 state and increases bacterial persistence, and these effects are partially dependent on SteE activity. Thus, manipulating granuloma macrophage polarization represents a strategy for intracellular bacteria to overcome host restriction during persistent infection.

Abstract: The discovery of the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) protein family was initiated by the identification of the MLL partner TET1, and of mutations in the TET2 gene in hematological malignancies including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). TET1, 2 and 3 proteins hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and further oxidize 5-hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC). Previous studies highlight the involvement of TET proteins in somatic cells reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), particularly Tet1 and 2 in mouse and TET1 in human. Here, we asked whether endogenous TET2 knockdown also displays this function. Using different shRNA against TET2, we provide evidence that TET2 strongly decreases the reprogramming of human hematopoietic progenitor cells into iPSC. Importantly, using 2 MPN patients, we observed that TET2 mutations affecting catalytic domain allowed iPSC generation. Instead, using another TET2 and TET3-mutated patient, we could only reprogram IPSC with TET3 mutation alone, suggesting that the type of TET2 mutation and/or the cooperation with TET3 mutations may alter the reprogramming activity. Altogether, this work highlights the importance of endogenous TET in the reprogramming process of human hematopoietic progenitors.

Abstract: Periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)-based tissue engineering is an important method for regenerating lost bone in periodontitis. Maintaining or enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, as well as enhancing the resistance of PDLSCs to oxidative stress, is necessary in this process. As a common hypoglycemic drug, metformin has been reported to have multiple effects on cell functions. This study found that low concentrations of metformin did not affect cell proliferation but did inhibit adipogenic differentiation and promote osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. This positive effect was associated with activation of Akt signaling by metformin. Moreover, applying metformin as either a pretreatment or co-treatment could reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species, enhance antioxidant capacity, and rescue the cell viability and osteogenic differentiation that were negatively affected by H2O2-induced oxidative stress in PDLSCs. In addition, metformin was found to activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway in PDLSCs, and knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA impaired the protective effect of metformin. Taken together, these results indicate that metformin not only promotes osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, but also protects PDLSCs against oxidative stress-induced damage, suggesting that metformin could be potentially useful in promoting PDLSC-based bone regeneration in the treatment of periodontitis.

Abstract: IER5 gene encodes an activator of HSF1 and is a p53 target gene. The IER5 protein forms a ternary complex with HSF1 and PP2A, and promotes PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of HSF1 at a number of serine and threonine residues. This hypo-phosphorylated form of HSF1 is transcriptionally active and has been suggested to be responsible for the HSF1 activation observed in cancers. Here we report that IER5 possess a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) at amino acids 217–244 that is highly conserved among species and that mediates complex formation with importin-α and importin-β. We also demonstrate that the intact NLS is essential for HSF1 dephosphorylation and full activation by IER5. Thus, nuclear import of IER5 via importin-α and importin-β may be essential for IER5 function.

Abstract: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease in older men, and there is evidence that obesity is a causal factor. It is currently unclear whether the hormone leptin, which is positively correlated to obesity, is involved in BPH. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of leptin on testosterone-induced BPH in mice and to explore possible underlying mechanisms. Testosterone (3 mg/kg) was injected into wild-type and leptin-deﬁcient ob/ob male mice for 14 consecutive days, and prostate tissues were subjected to various analyses. Additionally, BPH epithelial-1 (BPH-1) cells were treated with leptin to further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Leptin deficiency attenuated testosterone-induced morphological and pathological changes of BPH in mice. Furthermore, leptin deficiency alleviated the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed the downregulation of bone morphogenic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) in testosterone-treated mice. The in vitro data revealed that leptin significantly increased the expression of the EMT-associated marker vimentin but decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and that upregulation of BAMBI mitigated the intensity of leptin-induced EMT responses. Our results suggest that leptin can promote EMT in BPH through downregulating BAMBI. Suppressing leptin might be a potential therapeutic approach in preventing BPH development and progression.

Abstract: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding. The clinical management of ITP currently remains a challenge for hematologists. We explored the role of interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the treatment of CD41-induced ITP, and investigated its underlying mechanisms in a CD41-induced ITP mouse model. IL-9 treatment increased the numbers of mature megakaryocytes (CD41+CD42d+) and CD41+Sca-1+ cells in the bone marrow in these model mice, while IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the process. Moreover, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), as a downstream molecule of IL-9R, was increased after IL-9 treatment. We next investigated the source of IL-9 in bone marrow, osteoblasts produced the highest level of IL-9. These results confirmed that IL-9 could prevent CD41-induced ITP in BALB/c mice by regulating osteoblasts and activating IL-9R/STAT5 signaling in megakaryocytes, thus providing further evidence for IL-9 as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of ITP.

Abstract: Summary
Rabies virus (RABV), the etiological agent for the lethal disease of rabies, is a deadly zoonotic pathogen. The RABV glycoprotein (RABV-G) is a key factor mediating virus entry and the major target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we report the crystal structures of RABV-G solved in the free form at ∼pH-8.0 and in the complex form with a neutralizing antibody 523-11 at ∼pH-6.5, respectively. RABV-G has three domains, and the basic-to-acidic pH change results in large domain re-orientations and concomitant domain-linker re-constructions, switching it from a bent hairpin conformation into an extended conformation. During such low-pH-induced structural transitions, residues located in the domain-linker are found to play important roles in glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion. Finally, the antibody interacts with RABV-G mainly through its heavy chain and binds to a bipartite conformational epitope in the viral protein for neutralization. These structures provide valuable information for vaccine and drug design.

Abstract: Notch3 can act as a tumor suppressor in the breast cancer epithelial cells. Unfortunately, Notch3 expression is decreased or lost, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, and the reasons remain unclear. Here, we found Notch3 was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells with 5-Aza treatment. Two CpG islands were observed in notch3 promoter. Interestingly, bisulfite sequencing exhibited that large amounts of unconverted cytosines were not only followed by guanine, but also adenine, cytosine and thymine, which implied that there simultaneously existed CpG and non-CpG methylation in notch3 promoter. To better analyze the methylation frequency of non-CpG locus, we designed CpG/non-CpG methylation analysis software. The results showed that the methylation frequency of notch3 gene in different breast cancer cell lines was in order T47D, MCF-7, SKBR3, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231. Furthermore, we identified that DNMT3b, DNMT1, DNMT3L, Mecp2 and EZH2 were important regulators of non-CpG locus of notch3 gene. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed a negative correlation between EZH2 and Notch3 from 22 luminal and 26 TNBC cases. In vitro methylation combined luciferase activity assays showed that non-CpG methylation was still crucial cause leading to notch3 transcriptional repression in TNBC. Our findings provide possible explanation for the downregulation or loss of Notch3 expression in TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Although antibodies are routinely used to label and isolate a desired cell type from a more complex mixture of cells, via either fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), such antibody labeling is not easily reversible. We describe an FACS and MACS compatible method to reversibly label and purify cells using aptamers. Magnetic beads loaded with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-binding antagonistic aptamer E07 specifically isolated EGFR-expressing cells, and pure, label-free cells were recovered via treatment with an “antidote” oligonucleotide complementary to the aptamer. Additionally, while FACS sorting cells with E07 or EGFR antibody yielded EGFR(+) cells with impeded EGFR signaling, stripping off the aptamer via antidote treatment restored receptor function, returning cells to their native state, which was not possible with the antibody. The ability to reversibly label or isolate cells without compromising their function is a valuable, versatile tool with important implications for both the laboratory and clinic.

Abstract: Summary
The triazine antitubercular JSF-2019 was of interest due to its in vitro efficacy and the nitro group shared with the clinically relevant delamanid and pretomanid. JSF-2019 undergoes activation requiring F420H2 and one or more nitroreductases in addition to Ddn. An intrabacterial drug metabolism (IBDM) platform was leveraged to demonstrate the system kinetics, evidencing formation of NO⋅ and a des-nitro metabolite. Structure-activity relationship studies focused on improving the solubility and mouse pharmacokinetic profile of JSF-2019 and culminated in JSF-2513, relying on the key introduction of a morpholine. Mechanistic studies with JSF-2019, JSF-2513, and other triazines stressed the significance of achieving potent in vitro efficacy via release of intrabacterial NO⋅ along with inhibition of InhA and, more generally, the FAS-II pathway. This study highlights the importance of probing IBDM and its potential to clarify mechanism of action, which in this case is a combination of NO⋅ release and InhA inhibition.

Abstract: Thermal stress induces a wide array of morphological and physiological changes in potato affecting its development and economic yield. Response to thermal stress in plants is mostly regulated by heat shock factors (hsfs). The current study aimed at improving heat tolerance by transforming potato plant with heat shock factor, HsfA1d, using Agrobacterium. Gateway cloning strategy was adopted for isolation of HsfA1d from Arabidopsis thaliana and cloning into plant expression vector. The target gene was introduced into potato by infecting internodal explants with Agrobacterium strain GV3101 carrying pGWB402Ω-HsfA1d construct. Upon exposure to heat stress, the wild-type plants turned yellowish, whereas no phenotypic effect on transgenic plants was observed. Expression of HsfA1d in transgenic plants was increased by 5.8-fold under thermal stress compared to room temperature. Transgenic plants exhibited 6-fold increase in the expression of downstream HSP70 under thermal stress compared to wild-type plants. Both chlorophyll a and b were significantly decreased in wild-type plants while no such decrease was recorded in transgenic plants under thermal stress. Heat stress was found to have no significant effect on carotenoid pigments of both wild-type and transgenic plants. Significantly lower electrolyte leakage from transgenic plants was witnessed compared to wild type upon exposure to thermal stress. Transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher proline content compared to wild-type plants under heat stress. It is concluded that HsfA1d plays a vital role in plant thermotolerance and hence can be effectively used to enhance the resistance of crop plants against heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens antagonize anti-bacterial immunity through translocated effector proteins that inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling. In addition, the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium initiates an anti-inflammatory transcriptional response in macrophages through its effector protein SteE. However, the target(s) and molecular mechanism of SteE remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SteE converts both the amino acid and substrate specificity of the host pleiotropic serine/threonine kinase GSK3. SteE itself is a substrate of GSK3, and phosphorylation of SteE is required for its activity. Remarkably, phosphorylated SteE then forces GSK3 to phosphorylate the non-canonical substrate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on tyrosine-705. This results in STAT3 activation, which along with GSK3 is required for SteE-mediated upregulation of the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage marker interleukin-4Rα (IL-4Rα). Overall, the conversion of GSK3 to a tyrosine-directed kinase represents a tightly regulated event that enables a bacterial virulence protein to reprogram innate immune signaling and establish an anti-inflammatory environment.

Abstract: Summary
The ex vivo production of platelets depleted of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) could serve as a universal measure to overcome platelet transfusion refractoriness caused by HLA-I incompatibility. Here, we developed human induced pluripotent cell-derived HLA-I-deficient platelets (HLA-KO iPLATs) in a clinically applicable imMKCL system by genetic manipulation and assessed their immunogenic properties including natural killer (NK) cells, which reject HLA-I downregulated cells. HLA-KO iPLATs were deficient for all HLA-I but did not elicit a cytotoxic response by NK cells in vitro and showed circulation equal to wild-type iPLATs upon transfusion in our newly established Hu-NK-MSTRG mice reconstituted with human NK cells. Additionally, HLA-KO iPLATs successfully circulated in an alloimmune platelet transfusion refractoriness model of Hu-NK-MISTRG mice. Mechanistically, the lack of NK cell-activating ligands on platelets may be responsible for evading the NK cell response. This study revealed the unique non-immunogenic property of platelets and provides a proof of concept for the clinical application of HLA-KO iPLATs.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma is a common malignancy of the bone tissue. The rapid growth exhibited by this cancer is a primary challenge in its treatment. In many types of cancers, FAT10, a ubiquitin-like protein, is involved in several biological activities, especially cell proliferation. Herein, we demonstrate that FAT10 plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to its expression in adjacent normal tissues. Functional assays revealed that knockdown of FAT10 expression significantly repressed the proliferation of osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicate that FAT10 exhibits oncogenic functions by regulating the level of YAP1, a key protein of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, and a significant positive correlation exists between the levels of FAT10 and YAP1. Further analysis showed that FAT10-induced growth of osteosarcoma cells is dependent on YAP1. Mechanistically, FAT10 stabilizes YAP1 expression by regulating its ubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our results link the two drivers of cell growth in osteosarcoma and reveal a novel pathway for FAT10 regulation. We provide new evidence for the biological and clinical significance of FAT10 as a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Background
Emerging evidence demonstrates that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as important active eicosanoids that regulate cardiovascular homeostasis, but the mechanisms underlying its favorable anti-hypertrophic benefits in overpressure model remain obscure.
Methods and results
Four weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC), TAC mice developed maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and consequent cardiac failure. Conversely, a cardiotropic adeno-associated viral vector (AAV9) encoding CYP2J2 prevented transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction. EET also conferred protection against phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Further investigations indicate CYP2J2/EET exerts protection against cardiac hypertrophy through opposing the increase of intracellular Ca2+ level and Ca2+-mediated calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling. Meanwhile, extended myocardial fibrosis in TAC mice was also effectively abolished with the administration of AAV9-2J2. Intriguingly, TAC mice display activated TGF-β/Samd-3 signaling with decreased Smad-7 expression, whereas AAV9-2J2 attenuated the phosphorylation of Smad-3 without altering TGF-β expression, whilst preservation of Smad-7. Subsequently, the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in the presence of TGF-β1 stimulation was significantly disrupted with EET treatment, accompanied by declined Smad-3 activation and collagen production, whereas inhibition of Smad-7 with SiRNA Smad-7 substantially abrogated these effects of EET on cardiac fibroblasts.
Conclusions
EET has synergistic actions on cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, preventing cardiac hypertrophy through inhibition of Ca2+-mediated calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling cascades, and ameliorating myocardial fibrosis dependent on Smad-7. This work further extends the potential mechanisms of EET, providing a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pathological remodeling and heart failure.

Abstract: In the multi-step differentiation protocol used to generate pancreatic endocrine cells from human pluripotent stem cells, the induction of NGN3+ endocrine precursors from the PDX1+/NKX6.1+ pancreatic endoderm is crucial for efficient endocrine cell production. Here, we demonstrate that transient, not prolonged FOXO1 inhibition results in enhanced NGN3+ endocrine precursors and hormone-producing cell production. FOXO1 inhibition does not directly induce NGN3 expression but stimulates PDX1+/NKX6.1+ cell proliferation. NOTCH activity, whose suppression is important for Ngn3 expression, is not suppressed but Wnt signaling is stimulated by FOXO1 inhibition. Reversely, Wnt inhibition suppresses the effects of FOXO1 inhibitor. These findings indicate that FOXO1 and Wnt are involved in regulating the proliferation of PDX1+/NKX6.1+ pancreatic endoderm that gives rise to NGN3+ endocrine precursors.

Abstract: Summary
The gut is a first point of contact with ingested xenobiotics, where chemicals are metabolized directly by the host or microbiota. Atrazine is a widely used pesticide, but the role of the microbiome metabolism of this xenobiotic and the impact on host responses is unclear. We exposed successive generations of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis to subtoxic levels of atrazine and observed changes in the structure and function of the gut microbiome that conveyed atrazine resistance. This microbiome-mediated resistance was maternally inherited and increased over successive generations, while also heightening the rate of host genome selection. The rare gut bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas protegens contributed to atrazine metabolism. Both of these bacteria contain genes that are linked to atrazine degradation and were sufficient to confer resistance in experimental wasp populations. Thus, pesticide exposure causes functional, inherited changes in the microbiome that should be considered when assessing xenobiotic exposure and as potential countermeasures to toxicity.

Abstract: Aerobic glycolysis promotes metastasis and correlates with poorer clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the controllers and mechanisms of abnormally activated glycolysis remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that the fifth component of the constitutive photomorphogenic 9 (COP9) signalosome complex (COPS5/CSN5) was a controller of glycolysis. For the first time, we found that CSN5 could influence the expression of glycolytic metabolism-associated proteins, especially hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme. In addition, we found that CSN5 was associated with HK2 overexpression in HCC tissues. Silencing CSN5 expression caused a decrease in the level of the HK2 protein, glucose uptake, glycolysis capacity and the production of glycolytic intermediates in HCC cells. Re-expression of HK2 rescued the decreased glycolytic flux induced by CSN5 knockdown, whereas inhibition of HK2 alleviated CSN5-enhanced glycolysis. Functionally, CSN5 regulated HCC cell invasion and metastasis via HK2-mediated glycolysis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CSN5 attenuated the ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated degradation of HK2 through its deubiquitinase function. Inhibition of CSN5 kinase activity by curcumin decreased HK2 protein expression and glycolysis, repressed the metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing nude mice. Overall, our study identified CSN5 as a controller of glycolysis, and it may be a potential treatment target for HCC.

Abstract: Bone resorption, caused by osteoclasts (OCs), is important to bone homeostasis. The abnormalities of bone resorption may induce a series of diseases, including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and aseptic peri-implant loosening. The latest research developed,a novel tyrosine and phosphoinositide kinase dual inhibitor, named PP121, inhibited Src in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell. However, the therapeutic function of PP121 on abnormal bone resorption is still uncertain. In the present study, we showed that PP121 could potently suppress osteoclast differentiation, osteoclast-specific gene expression and bone resorption via suppressing Src/MAPK (ERK and p38)/Akt-mediated NFATc1 induction in vitro. \It was found that PP121 could suppress the formation of osteoclasts from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without causing cytotoxicity, inhibit bone resorption and downregulate the mRNA level of osteoclast-specific markers, including calcitonin receptor (CTR), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), Cellular oncogene fos (C-Fos) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Consistent with in vitro observation, we found that PP121 greatly ameliorated LPS-induced bone resorption. Our results provide promising evidence of the therapeutic potential of PP121 for osteolytic diseases related to excessive osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

Abstract: Summary
Although a link between the gut microbiota and alcohol-related liver diseases (ALDs) has previously been suggested, the causative effects of specific taxa and their functions have not been fully investigated to date. Here, we analyze the gut microbiota of 410 fecal samples from 212 Korean twins by using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scales to adjust for host genetics. This analysis revealed a strong association between low AUDIT scores and the abundance of the butyrate-producing genus Roseburia. When Roseburia spp. are administered to ALD murine models, both hepatic steatosis and inflammation significantly improve regardless of bacterial viability. Specifically, the flagellin of R. intestinalis, possibly through Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) recognition, recovers gut barrier integrity through upregulation of the tight junction protein Occludin and helps to restore the gut microbiota through elevated expression of IL-22 and REG3γ. Our study demonstrates that Roseburia spp. improve the gut ecosystem and prevent leaky gut, leading to ameliorated ALDs.

In this ultrastructural study we utilised array tomography, a high-resolution volume scanning electron microscopy approach to 3D reconstruct the cellular relationships formed by leukocytes recruited to the luminal uterine epithelium 12 h post-mating in the rat. We report that following mating, neutrophils and macrophages are internalised by the luminal uterine epithelium, with multiple leukocytes internalised via contortion through a small tunnel in the apical membrane into a large membrane-bound vacuole within the cytoplasm of luminal uterine epithelial cells (UECs). Once internalised within the UECs, recruited leukocytes appear to phagocytose material within the membrane-bound vacuole and most ultimately undergo a specialised cell death, including vacuolisation and loss of membrane integrity. As these observations involve ultrastructurally normal leukocytic cells internalised within non-phagocytic epithelial cells, these observations are consistent with the formation of cell-in-cell structures via entosis, rather than phagocytic engulfment by UECs. Although cell-in-cell structures have been reported in normal and pathological conditions elsewhere, the data collected herein represents the first evidence of the formation of cell-in-cell structures within the uterine epithelium as a novel component of the maternal inflammatory response to mating.

Abstract: Summary
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme in DNA biogenesis and a target of several chemotherapeutics. Here, we investigate how anti-leukemic drugs (e.g., clofarabine [ClF]) that target one of the two subunits of RNR, RNR-α, affect non-canonical RNR-α functions. We discovered that these clinically approved RNR-inhibiting dATP-analogs inhibit growth by also targeting ZRANB3—a recently identified DNA synthesis promoter and nuclear-localized interactor of RNR-α. Remarkably, in early time points following drug treatment, ZRANB3 targeting accounted for most of the drug-induced DNA synthesis suppression and multiple cell types featuring ZRANB3 knockout/knockdown were resistant to these drugs. In addition, ZRANB3 plays a major role in regulating tumor invasion and H-rasG12V-promoted transformation in a manner dependent on the recently discovered interactome of RNR-α involving select cytosolic-/nuclear-localized protein players. The H-rasG12V-promoted transformation—which we show requires ZRANB3-supported DNA synthesis—was efficiently suppressed by ClF. Such overlooked mechanisms of action of approved drugs and a previously unappreciated example of non-oncogene addiction, which is suppressed by RNR-α, may advance cancer interventions.

Abstract: Phthalates, particularly di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are compounds widely used as plasticizers and have become serious global contaminants. Because of the bioaccumulation of such substances, the food chain is at risk. The food contamination by some phthalates has been linked to different side effects in experimental animals. That is why we have chosen the intestinal system’s cells which represent the primary targets of these compounds to test their toxic effects. Human colon carcinoma cells (HCT 116) were chosen to elucidate whether DEHP triggers oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results indicated that DEHP is cytotoxic; it induces the overexpression of Hsp70 protein and causes oxidative damage through the generation of free radicals leading to lipid peroxidation induction and the increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. In addition, cell treatment with DEHP resulted in a glutathione (GSH) content decrease and a decrease in the glutathione reductase (GR) activity. As new evidence provided in this study, we demonstrated that the DEHP affected the two enzymes’ activities of the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). This leads to a decrease in the level of NADPH used by the GR to maintain the regeneration of the reduced GSH. We also demonstrated that such effects can be responsible for DEHP-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial D2HGDH and L2HGDH catalyze the oxidation of D-2-HG and L-2-HG, respectively, into αKG. This contributes to cellular homeostasis in part by modulating the activity of αKG-dependent dioxygenases. Signals that control the expression/activity of D2HGDH/L2HGDH are presumed to broadly influence physiology and pathology. Using cell and mouse models, we discovered that MYC directly induces D2HGDH and L2HGDH transcription. Furthermore, in a manner suggestive of D2HGDH, L2HGDH, and αKG dependency, MYC activates TET enzymes and RNA demethylases, and promotes their nuclear localization. Consistent with these observations, in primary B cell lymphomas MYC expression positively correlated with enhancer hypomethylation and overexpression of lymphomagenic genes. Together, these data provide additional evidence for the role of mitochondria metabolism in influencing the epigenome and epitranscriptome, and imply that in specific contexts wild-type TET enzymes could demethylate and activate oncogenic enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) because of various hematologic problems, including myelosuppression. Here, we demonstrate that latently expressed HCMV miR-US5-2 downregulates the transcriptional repressor NGFI-A binding protein (NAB1) to induce myelosuppression of uninfected CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) through an increase in TGF-β production. Infection of HPCs with an HCMVΔmiR-US5-2 mutant resulted in decreased TGF-β expression and restoration of myelopoiesis. In contrast, we show that infected HPCs are refractory to TGF-β signaling as another HCMV miRNA, miR-UL22A, downregulates SMAD3, which is required for maintenance of latency. Our data suggest that latently expressed viral miRNAs manipulate stem cell homeostasis by inducing secretion of TGF-β while protecting infected HPCs from TGF-β-mediated effects on viral latency and reactivation. These observations provide a mechanism through which HCMV induces global myelosuppression following HSCT while maintaining lifelong infection in myeloid lineage cells.
