Abstract: Summary
Cerebral cortical development is controlled by key transcription factors that specify the neuronal identities in the different layers. The mechanisms controlling their expression in distinct cells are only partially known. We investigated the expression and stability of Tbr1, Bcl11b, Fezf2, Satb2, and Cux1 mRNAs in single developing mouse cortical cells. We observe that Satb2 mRNA appears much earlier than its protein and in a set of cells broader than expected, suggesting an initial inhibition of its translation, subsequently released during development. Mechanistically, Satb2 3′UTR modulates protein translation of GFP reporters during mouse corticogenesis. We select miR-541, a eutherian-specific miRNA, and miR-92a/b as the best candidates responsible for SATB2 inhibition, being strongly expressed in early and reduced in late progenitor cells. Their inactivation triggers robust and premature SATB2 translation in both mouse and human cortical cells. Our findings indicate RNA interference as a major mechanism in timing cortical cell identities.

Abstract: Ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), a mitochondrial membrane-associated flavoprotein, is essential for electron transfer and modulates p53-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells.FDXR may be implicated in epidermal and sebocytic differentiation, but its explicit function in sebocytes remains to be elucidated. In the present study, immunohistochemistry revealed that FDXR expression was increased in sebaceous cells of acne lesions. FDXR, PPARγ, LXRα/β, SREBP1 and Sox9 expression was incremental during sebocyte differentiation. FDXR overexpression induced by Ad-GFP-FDXR infection enhanced differentiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipogenesis and PPARγ expression, and consequnently inhibited proliferation in SZ95 sebocytes. Flow cytometry showed that FDXR overexpression induced significant blockade of G2/M phase but had no effect on sub-G1 (apoptotic) sebocytes. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced FDXR and PPARγ expression and lipogenesis were abolished by pretreatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results suggest that FDXR overexpression might promote differentiation and lipogenesis via ROS production and suppress proliferation via G2/S blockade in SZ95 sebocytes. IGF-1 could facilitate differentiation and lipogenesis through PI3K/Akt/FDXR pathway. FDXR could serve as a potential marker of advanced sebaceous differentiation, and its overexpression may be involved in the development of acne lesions.

Abstract: Exosomes have been shown to have therapeutic potential for cerebral ischemic diseases. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of normoxic and hypoxic bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes (N-BM-MSCs-Exo and H-BM-MSCs-Exo, respectively) on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells and rat primary cortical neurons. The proportions of dead cells in N2a and primary cortical neurons after OGD injury were significantly increased, and N-BM-MSCs-Exo (40 μg/ml) could reduce the ratios, noteworthily, the protective effects of H-BM-MSCs-Exo (40 μg/ml) were more potent. Western blotting analysis indicated that N-BM-MSCs-Exo decreased the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, cleaved IL-1β and IL-18 in N2a cells. However, H-BM-MSCs-Exo (40 μg/ml) was more powerful in inhibiting the expression of these proteins in comparison with N-BM-MSCs-Exo. Similar results were obtained in primary cortical neurons. Immunofluorescence assays showed that after N-BM-MSCs-Exo and H-BM-MSCs-Exo treatment, the co-localization of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and the GSDMD translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and membrane after OGD injury were reduced in N2a cells and primary cortical neurons, and H-BM-MSCs-Exo had a more obvious effect. In addition, N-BM-MSCs-Exo and H-BM-MSCs-Exo significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and the IL-18 levels in cell culture medium in N2a cells and primary cortical neurons. Once again H-BM-MSCs-Exo induced these effects more potently than N-BM-MSCs-Exo. All of these results demonstrated that N-BM-MSCs-Exo and H-BM-MSCs-Exo have significant neuroprotective effects against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. H-BM-MSCs-Exo has a more pronounced protective effect than N-BM-MSCs-Exo and may be used to ameliorate the progression of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia injury in patients.

Abstract: It has been reported that ACBD3 is closely related to the malignant process of cells, but its role in gastric cancer has not been elucidated. This study aims to investigate the expression and function of ACBD3 in human gastric cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were selected to analyze mRNA levels of ACBD3 in gastric cancer tissues and normal gastric epithelial tissues. qPCR and Western blot were conducted to detect the expression of ACBD3 in two normal gastric epithelial cell lines and five gastric cancer cell lines which were cultured in our laboratory. To exclude differences in individual background between different patients, we further detected the expression of ACBD3 in 8 pairs of malignant/non-malignant clinical gastric tissues. Through the establishment of stable cells, in vitro cell experiments and in vivo xenotransplantation models in mice, the role of ACBD3 in the proliferation of gastric cancer cells has been further explored. AKT inhibitors were used to deeply explore the molecular regulation mechanism of ACBD3. The results showed that the elevated ACBD3 in gastric cancer tissue were positively correlated with the clinical grade and prognosis of gastric cancer. In terms of molecular function, we found that ACBD3 can enhance the production and growth of gastric cancer cells. At the same time, the activation of AKT kinase played an important role in ACBD3's promotion of G1-to-S transition. The experiments generally indicate that ACBD3 is expected to become a potential diagnostic molecule or therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal birthdate is one of the major determinants of neuronal phenotypes. However, most birthdating methods are retrospective in nature, allowing very little experimental access to the classified neuronal subsets. Here, we introduce four neurogenic tagging mouse lines, which can assign CreER-loxP recombination to neuron subsets that share the same differentiation timing in living animals and enable various experimental manipulations of the classified subsets. We constructed a brain atlas of the neurogenic tagging mouse lines (NeuroGT), which includes holistic image data of the loxP-recombined neurons and their processes across the entire brain that were tagged on each single day during the neurodevelopmental period. This image database, which is open to the public, offers investigators the opportunity to find specific neurogenic tagging driver lines and the stages of tagging appropriate for their own research purposes.

Abstract: Monocultures of several cell types result in the formation of robust clusters called homotypic aggregates (HAs). How this physical aggregation affects cell fates in immune cell cultures, is poorly understood. We studied anti-CD40-stimulated primary B cell cultures, where cells assembled into large three-dimensional LFA1-driven HAs by 72 h. The dense packing in these aggregates restricts the infiltration of stimulants, such as antibodies, to cells inside the clusters. This creates a concentration gradient of stimulant availability across the cross-section of HAs. We describe a method to retain this positional information even after the disruption of HAs, for analysis by flow cytometry. Comparison of stage-specific cell-surface markers showed that the extent of stimulant-binding affected multiple fates non-uniformly. While germinal center and lineage markers were moderately upregulated, immunoglobulins and markers associated with memory were more than doubled in the peripheral cells binding more anti-CD40. These cells also experienced a strong repression of the plasma cell regulator Prdm1 and an upregulation of the oncogene Myc. Thus, cells at different locations in HAs are subjected to unequal doses of stimulants, leading to a hitherto unreported source of heterogeneity in cell fates. These findings can be extrapolated to understand the dose-dependent effects of stimulants in other three-dimensional cell clusters.

Abstract: Summary
The pluripotency factor OCT4 is essential for the maintenance of naive pluripotent stem cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the specific role of OCT4 in this process remains unknown. Here, we developed a rapid protein-level OCT4 depletion system that demonstrates that the immediate downstream response to loss of OCT4 is reduced expression of key pluripotency factors. Our data show a requirement for OCT4 for the efficient transcription of several key pluripotency factors and suggest that expression of trophectoderm markers is a subsequent event. In addition, we find that NANOG is able to bind to the genome in the absence of OCT4, and this binding is in fact enhanced. Globally, however, the active enhancer-associated histone mark H3K27ac is depleted. Our work establishes that, while OCT4 is required for the maintenance of the naive transcription factor network, at a normal embryonic stem cell levels it antagonizes this network through inhibition of NANOG binding.

Abstract: The deubiquitinating enzyme USP46 (ubiquitin-specific protease 46) is implicated in various cancers. However, its role and regulatory mechanism in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) are still unknown. In this study, we showed that USP46 is downregulated in HCC tissues and that low USP46 levels are associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In functional experiments, overexpression of USP46 impaired proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells, whereas knockdown of USP46 enhanced cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that USP46 suppresses HCC cell proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting YAP1. Ectopic expression of YAP1 rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis caused by USP46 overexpression. Mechanistically, USP46 promotes the degradation of YAP1 by increasing expression of MST1, and the increase in MST1 protein antagonizes YAP1 to suppress HCC progression. Finally, we demonstrated that USP46 stabilizes the MST1 protein by directly binding to it and decreasing its ubiquitination. Taken together, our results demonstrated that USP46 may be a novel tumor suppressor in HCC. Moreover, USP46 acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme of MST1 to potentiate MST1 kinase activity to suppress tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that USP46 activation may represent a potential treatment strategy for HCC.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is a key member of the HSP family that contributes to a pre-cancerous environment; however, its role in lung cancer remains poorly understood. The present study used geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) to induce HSP70 expression, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was used to construct an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) model by stimulating A549 cells in vitro. Western Blot was performed to detect protein levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and the EMT-associated proteins E-cadherin and vimentin both before and after HSP70 expression. Cell morphological changes were observed, and the effect of HSP70 on cell migration ability was detected via the wound healing. The results demonstrated that GGA at 50 and 200 μmol/L could significantly induce HSP70 expression in A549 cells (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HSP70 induced by 200 μmol/L GGA significantly inhibited the changes of E-cadherin, vimentin, and cell morphology induced by TGF-β (P < 0.05), while HSP70 induced by 50 μmol/L GGA did not. The results of the wound healing assay indicated that 200 μmol/L GGA significantly inhibited A549 cell migration induced by TGF-β. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that overexpression of HSP70 inhibited the TGF-β induced EMT process and changed the cell morphology and migratory ability induced by TGF-β in A549 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a revolutionary technique allowing production of pluripotent patient-specific cell lines used for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy. Integrity of nuclear DNA (nDNA) is mandatory to allow iPSCs utilization, while quality control of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is rarely included in the iPSCs validation process. In this study, we performed mtDNA deep sequencing during the transition from parental fibroblasts to reprogrammed iPSC and to differentiated neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) obtained from controls and patients affected by mitochondrial disorders. At each step, mtDNA variants, including those potentially pathogenic, fluctuate between emerging and disappearing, and some having functional implications. We strongly recommend including mtDNA analysis as an unavoidable assay to obtain fully certified usable iPSCs and NPCs.

Abstract: The cytoophidium, a filamentous structure formed by metabolic enzymes, has emerged as a novel regulatory machinery for certain proteins. The rate-limiting enzymes of de novo CTP and GTP synthesis, cytidine triphosphate synthase (CTPS) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), are the most characterized cytoophidium-forming enzymes in mammalian models. Although the assembly of CTPS cytoophidia has been demonstrated in various organisms including multiple human cancers, a systemic survey for the presence of CTPS cytoophidia in mammalian tissues in normal physiological conditions has not yet been reported. Herein, we examine major organs of adult mouse and observe that CTPS cytoophidia are displayed by a specific thymocyte population ranging between DN3 to early DP stages. Most of these cytoophidium-presenting cells have both CTPS and IMPDH cytoophidia and undergo rapid cell proliferation. In addition, we show that cytoophidium formation is associated with active glycolytic metabolism as the cytoophidium-presenting cells exhibit higher levels of c-Myc, phospho-Akt and PFK. Inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG, however, disrupts most of cytoophidium structures and impairs cell proliferation. Our findings not only indicate that the regulation of CTPS and IMPDH cytoophidia are correlated with the metabolic switch triggered by pre-TCR signaling, but also suggest physiological roles of the cytoophidium in thymocyte development.

Abstract: Summary
Uncoupling of mRNA expression from copy number (UECN) might be a strategy for cancer cells to a tolerate high degree of aneuploidy. To test the extent and role of UECN across cancers, we perform integrative multiomic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, encompassing ∼5,000 individual tumors. We find UECN is common in cancers and is associated with increased oncogenic signaling, proliferation, and immune suppression. UECN appears to be orchestrated by complex regulatory changes, with transcription factors (TFs) playing a prominent role. To further dissect the regulatory mechanisms, we develop a systems-biology approach to identify candidate TFs, which could serve as targets to disrupt UECN and reduce tumor fitness. Applying our approach to TCGA data, we identify 21 putative targets, 42.8% of which are validated by independent sources. Together, our study indicates that UECN is likely an important mechanism in development of aneuploid tumors and might be therapeutically targetable.

Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease characterized by inflammation and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Necroptosis plays a critical role in disease progression. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural dietary agonist of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), has shown alleviating effects on UC. However, its mechanisms of action have not been comprehensively elucidated. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the protective role of I3C in DSS-induced colitis mice models. I3C significantly ameliorated body weight loss, colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage in colitis mice, reduced disease activity index (DAI) and histological (HI) scores, as well as alleviated colonic necroptosis and inflammation. In vitro, I3C attenuated necroptosis and inflammation of colonoids and NCM460 cells. AHR, activated by I3C, inhibits activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and the subsequent assembly of necrosome in a time-dependent manner, as well as suppressing NF-κB activation and decreasing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 expression. Silencing of AHR aggravated necroptosis and inflammation of NCM460 cells, and did not be ameliorated by I3C. Furthermore, AHR activation induces the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and the ubiquitination of RIPK1. In conclusion, I3C exerts a protective effect in DSS-induced colitis mice models by alleviating the necroptosis and inflammation of IECs through activating AHR.

Abstract: DNA methylation is a common method of gene expression regulation, and this form of regulation occurs in the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Gene expression regulation via methylation is important for humans, although there is little understanding of the role of methylation in neuronal differentiation. We characterized the cellular differentiation potential of iPS cells derived from a patient with PWS with abnormal methylation (M-iPWS cells). A comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array revealed that, unlike iPWS cells (deletion genes type), the abnormally methylated M-iPWS cells had no deletion in the15q11.2-q13 chromosome region. In addition, methylation-specific PCR showed that M-iPWS cells had strong methylation in CpG island of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) on both alleles. To assess the effect of abnormal methylation on cell differentiation, the M-iPWS and iPWS cells were induced to differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs). The results suggest that iPWS and M-iPWS cells are defective at differentiation into ectoderm. Neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons derived from M-iPWS cells had fewer NSCs and mature neurons with low expression of NSCs and neuronal markers. We conclude that expression of the downstream of genes in the PWS region regulated by methylation is involved in neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, with its mortality rate reported to be in millions annually; one of the two subtypes is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated the interactions and expressions of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), microRNA-320a (miR-320a) and RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) in NSCLC tissues to determine the roles of ZEB1 in regulation of miR-320a and RAD51AP1 in the development and metastasis of NSCLC. First, the expression levels of miR-320a and ZEB1 were quantified in NSCLC tissues and cells. Transfection assay was conducted to identify the effects of miR-320a on the progression of NSCLC cells. The interaction of miR-320a with ZEB1 and RAD51AP1 was predicted and verified using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, subcutaneous xenograft tumors of 6-week mice and metastatic model tumors of 8-week mice were established to further explore the in vivo effect of miR-320a/ZEB1/RAD51AP1 on NSCLC. The findings revealed a lower expression of miR-320a in NSCLC tissues and cells, while this result was reversed regarding ZEB1 expression. ZEB1 suppressed miR-320a expression and upregulation of miR-320a resulted in the reduction of proliferation, invasion and metastasis rate of NSCLC cells, and promoted NSCLC cell apoptosis. ZEB1 promoted the expression of RAD51AP1 via inhibition of miR-320a, promoting tumor growth in vivo. ZEB1 transcriptionally inhibited the expression of miR-320a and upregulated the expression of RAD51AP1, thereby promoting metastasis in NSCLC.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening vascular disease with no effective pharmaceutical therapies currently available. Inflammation plays a key role in the progression of aneurysms. Dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, has showed alleviating effects on cells in vitro from TAAD patients. Here we performed a study aiming at investigating the protective role of DEX in a β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN)-induced TAAD mouse model. DEX (dose: 0.04 mg/kg/day) treatment significantly reduced the aortic diameter and inhibited TAAD formation. DEX reduced infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), expression of metalloproteinase 2/9, and extracellular matrix degradation in BAPN-treated TAAD mice. Furthermore, DEX therapy downregulated the expression of p-p65 in macrophages and VSMCs, which suggested that DEX might ameliorate BAPN-induced TAAD by suppressing NF-κB signaling. Therefore, DEX therapy attenuates the progression of BAPN-induced TAAD murine model and could be used as an effective adjuvant therapy for treating TAAD.

Abstract: Summary
Designing covalent inhibitors is increasingly important, although it remains challenging. Here, we present covalentizer, a computational pipeline for identifying irreversible inhibitors based on structures of targets with non-covalent binders. Through covalent docking of tailored focused libraries, we identify candidates that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while preserving the interactions of the original molecule. We found ∼11,000 cysteines proximal to a ligand across 8,386 complexes in the PDB. Of these, the protocol identified 1,553 structures with covalent predictions. In a prospective evaluation, five out of nine predicted covalent kinase inhibitors showed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 155 nM and 4.5 μM. Application against an existing SARS-CoV Mpro reversible inhibitor led to an acrylamide inhibitor series with low micromolar IC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The docking was validated by 12 co-crystal structures. Together these examples hint at the vast number of covalent inhibitors accessible through our protocol.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying biomarkers to predict the clinical outcomes of individual patients is a fundamental problem in clinical oncology. Multiple single-gene biomarkers have already been identified and used in clinics. However, multiple oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes are involved during the process of tumorigenesis. Additionally, the efficacy of single-gene biomarkers is limited by the extensively variable expression levels measured by high-throughput assays. In this study, we hypothesize that in individual tumor samples, the disruption of transcription homeostasis in key pathways or gene sets plays an important role in tumorigenesis and has profound implications for the patient's clinical outcome. We devised a computational method named iPath to identify, at the individual-sample level, which pathways or gene sets significantly deviate from their norms. We conducted a pan-cancer analysis and demonstrated that iPath is capable of identifying highly predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes, including overall survival, tumor subtypes, and tumor-stage classifications.

Abstract: In addition to fuel cell applications, water electrolysis affords several opportunities for producing high-grade heat by utilising electrolytic hydrogen and oxygen in combustion applications. This can reduce or eliminate the atmospheric emissions associated with the combustion of conventional fuels. Importantly, net-zero heat can be produced if the electrolyser is powered by renewable electricity, whereby the output gases may be termed green hydrogen and green oxygen. This paper provides an overview of prospective applications for electrolysers in the heat sector by considering three general implementation pathways based on how the electrolytic oxygen is used.

Abstract: Reprogrammed energy metabolism, especially the Warburg effect, is emerged as a hallmark of cancer. The protein lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 functions as an oncogene and is implicated in various malignant phenotypes of human cancers. However, the role of SMYD2 in tumor metabolism is still largely unknown. Here, we report that SMYD2 is highly expressed in human cervical cancer and its aberrant expression is linked to a poor prognosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a novel link between SMYD2 expression and aerobic glycolysis. Through loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that SMYD2 knockdown or inhibition induced a metabolic shift from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, as evidenced by glucose uptake, lactate production, extracellular acidification, and the oxygen consumption rate. In contrast, SMYD2 overexpression promoted glycolytic metabolism in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, SMYD2 was required for tumor growth in cervical cancer and this oncogenic activity was largely glycolysis-dependent. Mechanistically, SMYD2 altered the methylation status of p53 and inhibited its transcriptional activity. Genetic silencing of p53 largely abrogated the effects of SMYD2 in promoting aerobic glycolysis. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel function of SMYD2 in regulating the Warburg effect in cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The recent development of neurogenetic tools in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is beginning to shed light on the neural basis of behaviors that make this species a major vector of human disease. However, we still lack a pan-neuronal expression driver—a key tool that provides genetic access to all neurons. Here, we describe our efforts to fill this gap via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of reporters to broadly expressed neural genes and report on the generation of two strains, a Syt1:GCaMP6s strain that expresses synaptically localized GCaMP and a brp-T2A-QF2w driver strain that can be used to drive and amplify expression of any effector via the Q binary system. Both manipulations broadly and uniformly label the nervous system with only modest effects on behavior. We expect these strains to facilitate neurobiological research in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and document both successful and failed manipulations as a roadmap for similar tool development in other non-model species.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, on the basis of antibody-dependent agglutination of antigen-coated latex particles. When validated using plasma samples that are positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, the agglutination assay detected antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 100% specificity and ∼98% sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the strength of the S-RBD antibody response measured by the agglutination assay correlated with the efficiency of the plasma in blocking RBD binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in a surrogate neutralization assay, suggesting that the agglutination assay might be used to identify individuals with virus-neutralizing antibodies. Intriguingly, we found that >92% of patients had detectable antibodies on the day of a positive viral RNA test, suggesting that the agglutination antibody test might complement RNA testing for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1/p62) is involved in cellular processes such as autophagy and metabolic reprogramming. Mutations resulting in the loss of function of SQSTM1 lead to neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal dementia. The pathogenic mechanism that contributes to SQSTM1-related neurodegeneration has been linked to its role as an autophagy adaptor, but this is poorly understood, and its precise role in mitochondrial function and clearance remains to be clarified. Here, we assessed the importance of SQSTM1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons through the knockout of SQSTM1. We show that SQSTM1 depletion causes altered mitochondrial gene expression and functionality, as well as autophagy flux, in iPSC-derived neurons. However, SQSTM1 is not essential for mitophagy despite having a significant impact on early PINK1-dependent mitophagy processes including PINK1 recruitment and phosphorylation of ubiquitin on depolarized mitochondria. These findings suggest that SQSTM1 is important for mitochondrial function rather than clearance.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii must scavenge cholesterol and other lipids from the host to facilitate intracellular growth and replication. Enzymes responsible for neutral lipid synthesis have been identified but there is no evidence for enzymes that catalyze lipolysis of cholesterol esters and esterified lipids. Here, we characterize several T. gondii serine hydrolases with esterase and thioesterase activities that were previously thought to be depalmitoylating enzymes. We find they do not cleave palmitoyl thiol esters but rather hydrolyze short-chain lipid esters. Deletion of one of the hydrolases results in alterations in levels of multiple lipids species. We also identify small-molecule inhibitors of these hydrolases and show that treatment of parasites results in phenotypic defects reminiscent of parasites exposed to excess cholesterol or oleic acid. Together, these data characterize enzymes necessary for processing lipids critical for infection and highlight the potential for targeting parasite hydrolases for therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (RH5) is a leading Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage vaccine candidate. Another possible candidate, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), was not efficacious in malaria-endemic populations, likely due to pre-existing antimalarial antibodies that interfered with the activity of vaccine-induced AMA1 antibodies, as judged by in vitro growth inhibition assay (GIA). To determine how pre-existing antibodies interact with vaccine-induced RH5 antibodies, we purify total and RH5-specific immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) from malaria-exposed Malians and malaria-naive RH5 vaccinees. Infection-induced RH5 antibody titers are much lower than those induced by vaccination, and RH5-specific IgGs show differences in the binding site between the two populations. In GIA, Malian polyclonal IgGs show additive or synergistic interactions with RH5 human monoclonal antibodies and overall additive interactions with vaccine-induced polyclonal RH5 IgGs. These results suggest that pre-existing antibodies will interact favorably with vaccine-induced RH5 antibodies, in contrast to AMA1 antibodies. This study supports RH5 vaccine trials in malaria-endemic regions.

Abstract: CBL (Casitas B cell lymphoma), an important ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in protein folding, protein maturation, and proteasome-dependent protein catabolism in different cells. However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy is still unclear. In this study, we found that expression of CBL is increased in an Ang II-induced mouse cardiac hypertrophy animal model and in Ang II-treated H9C2 cells. Interference with CBL expression attenuates the degree of myocardial hypertrophy as well as the expression of hypertrophy-related genes in H9C2 cells. Further research found that CBL aggravates myocardial hypertrophy by activating HIF-1α, which is an aggravating factor for hypertrophy. The effect of CBL on promoting myocardial hypertrophy was reversed by interference with HIF-1α. Mechanistically, we found that CBL directly interacted with and degraded VHL by increasing its ubiquitination level, which is a widely accepted regulatory factor of HIF-1α. Finally, our results showed that CBL was partially dependent on degradation of VHL and that activation of HIF-1α promoted myocardial hypertrophy. Collectively, these findings suggest that strategies based on activation of the CBL/HIF-1α axis might be promising for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Summary
Natural products (NPs) encompass a rich source of bioactive chemical entities. Here, we used human cancer stem cells (CSCs) in a chemical genomics campaign with NP chemical space to interrogate extracts from diverse strains of actinomycete for anti-cancer properties. We identified a compound (McM25044) capable of selectively inhibiting human CSC function versus normal stem cell counterparts. Biochemical and molecular studies revealed that McM025044 exerts inhibition on human CSCs through the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) cascade, found to be hyperactive in a variety of human cancers. McM025044 impedes the SUMOylation pathway via direct targeting of the SAE1/2 complex. Treatment of patient-derived CSCs resulted in reduced levels of SUMOylated proteins and suppression of progenitor and stem cell capacity measured in vitro and in vivo. Our study overcomes a barrier in chemically inhibiting oncogenic SUMOylation activity and uncovers a unique role for SAE2 in the biology of human cancers.

Abstract: Twist related protein 2 (TWIST2) plays an important role in bone development, tumorigenesis, tumour progression and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). At present, there are few reports about the role of TWIST2 in lung cancer, which need to be further explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the role and molecular mechanism of TWIST2 in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. The expression of TWIST2 in tissues of patients and cell lines was measured using RT-qPCR and western blotting. MTT and CCK8 assays were used to detect cell proliferation and viability. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of EMT-related proteins, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Slug. The results revealed that TWIST2 is lowly expressed in the tissues of lung cancer patients and cell lines. Further studies found that overexpression of TWIST2 significantly induced apoptosis and promoted the expression of E-cadherin, as well as inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Slug. More importantly, TWIST2 induced oxidative stress in lung cancer cells. In addition, TWIST2 regulated the FGF21 and AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway, which is involved in the molecular mechanism of the gene in lung cancer cells. We suggest that the mechanism of TWIST2 inhibition of the progression of lung cancer is by regulating the FGF21-mediated AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic RAS proteins, common oncogenic drivers in many human cancers, have been refractory to conventional small-molecule and macromolecule inhibitors due to their intracellular localization and the lack of druggable pockets. Here, we present a feasible strategy for designing RAS inhibitors that involves intracellular delivery of RAS-binding domain (RBD), a nanomolar-affinity specific ligand of RAS. Screening of 51 different combinations of RBD and cell-permeable peptides has identified Pen-cRaf-v1 as a cell-permeable pan-RAS inhibitor capable of targeting both G12C and non-G12C RAS mutants. Pen-cRaf-v1 crosses the cell membrane via endocytosis, competitively inhibits RAS-effector interaction, and thereby exerts anticancer activity against several KRAS-mutant cancer cell lines. Moreover, Pen-cRaf-v1 exhibits excellent activity comparable with a leading pan-RAS inhibitor (BI-2852), as well as high target specificity in transcriptome analysis and alanine mutation analysis. These findings demonstrate that specific inhibition of oncogenic RAS, and possibly treatment of RAS-mutant cancer, is feasible by intracellular delivery of RBD.

Abstract: Summary
In response to corpus callosum (CC) demyelination, subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors (SVZdNPs) are mobilized and generate new myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLG). Here, we examine the putative immunomodulatory properties of endogenous SVZdNPs during demyelination in the cuprizone model. SVZdNP density was higher in the lateral and rostral CC regions, and demyelination was inversely correlated with activated microglial density and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that CC areas with high levels of SVZdNP mobilization were enriched in a microglial cell subpopulation with an immunomodulatory signature. We propose MFGE8 (milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-8) and β3 integrin as a ligand/receptor pair involved in dialogue between SVZdNPs and microglia. Immature SVZdNPs mobilized to the demyelinated CC were found highly enriched in MFGE8, which promoted the phagocytosis of myelin debris in vitro. Overall, these results demonstrate that, in addition to their cell replacement capacity, endogenous progenitors have immunomodulatory properties, highlighting a new role for endogenous SVZdNPs in myelin regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare X-linked recessive disease that is associated with severe progressive muscle degeneration culminating in death due to cardiorespiratory failure. We previously observed an unexpected proliferation-independent telomere shortening in cardiomyocytes of a DMD mouse model. Here, we provide mechanistic insights using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Using traction force microscopy, we show that DMD hiPSC-CMs exhibit deficits in force generation on fibrotic-like bioengineered hydrogels, aberrant calcium handling, and increased reactive oxygen species levels. Furthermore, we observed a progressive post-mitotic telomere shortening in DMD hiPSC-CMs coincident with downregulation of shelterin complex, telomere capping proteins, and activation of the p53 DNA damage response. This telomere shortening is blocked by blebbistatin, which inhibits contraction in DMD cardiomyocytes. Our studies underscore the role of fibrotic stiffening in the etiology of DMD cardiomyopathy. In addition, our data indicate that telomere shortening is progressive, contraction dependent, and mechanosensitive, and suggest points of therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Across species, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise during embryogenesis from a specialized arterial population, termed hemogenic endothelium. Here, we describe a mechanistic role for the epigenetic regulator, Enhancer of zeste homolog-1 (Ezh1), in vertebrate HSPC production via regulation of hemogenic commitment. Loss of ezh1 in zebrafish embryos favored acquisition of hemogenic (gata2b) and HSPC (runx1) fate at the expense of the arterial program (ephrinb2a, dll4). In contrast, ezh1 overexpression blocked hematopoietic progression via maintenance of arterial gene expression. The related Polycomb group subunit, Ezh2, functioned in a non-redundant, sequential manner, whereby inhibition had no impact on arterial identity, but was capable of blocking ezh1-knockdown-associated HSPC expansion. Single-cell RNA sequencing across ezh1 genotypes revealed a dropout of ezh1+/− cells among arterial endothelium associated with positive regulation of gene transcription. Exploitation of Ezh1/2 modulation has potential functional relevance for improving in vitro HSPC differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cell sources.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide spectrum of disease presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity and the levels of circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, including virus-neutralizing titers. A serological analysis of 536 convalescent healthcare workers reveals that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels are elevated in individuals that experience severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody is dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), with an IgG subclass ratio skewed toward elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. In addition, individuals that experience severe disease show elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody binding to the inflammatory receptor FcɣRIIIa. Based on these correlational studies, we propose that spike-specific IgG subclass utilization may contribute to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions. These results may have significant implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design and convalescent plasma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) ensure communication between motor neurons (MNs) and muscle; however, in MN disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), NMJs degenerate resulting in muscle atrophy. The aim of this study was to establish a versatile and reproducible in vitro model of a human motor unit to investigate the effects of ALS-causing mutations. Therefore, we generated a co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs and human primary mesoangioblast-derived myotubes in microfluidic devices. A chemotactic and volumetric gradient facilitated the growth of MN neurites through microgrooves resulting in the interaction with myotubes and the formation of NMJs. We observed that ALS-causing FUS mutations resulted in reduced neurite outgrowth as well as an impaired neurite regrowth upon axotomy. NMJ numbers were likewise reduced in the FUS-ALS model. Interestingly, the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, Tubastatin A, improved the neurite outgrowth, regrowth, and NMJ morphology, prompting HDAC6 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially described as a viral infection of the respiratory tract. It is now known, however, that several other organs are affected, including the brain. Neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, and psychiatric conditions have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but the neurotropic potential of the virus is still debated. Herein, we sought to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human neural cells. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of neural tissue is non-permissive, however, it can elicit inflammatory response and cell damage. These findings add to the hypothesis that most of the neural damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to a systemic inflammation leading to indirect harmful effects on the central nervous system despite the absence of local viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Untargeted metabolomics is used to refine the development of biomarkers for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Myocardial infarction (MI) has major individual and societal consequences for patients, who remain at high risk of secondary events, despite advances in pharmacological therapy. To monitor their differential response to treatment, we performed untargeted plasma metabolomics on 175 patients from the platelet inhibition and patient outcomes (PLATO) trial treated with ticagrelor and clopidogrel, two common P2Y12 inhibitors. We identified a signature that discriminates patients, which involves polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and particularly the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoate and eicosapentaenoate. The known cardiovascular benefits of PUFAs could contribute to the efficacy of ticagrelor. Our work, beyond pointing out the high relevance of untargeted metabolomics in evaluating response to treatment, establishes PUFA metabolism as a pathway of clinical interest in the recovery path from MI.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally. Elderly individuals are at a higher risk of developing NAFLD with severe clinical outcomes. Although NAFLD is closely related to liver aging, the role of hepatocyte senescence in the progression of NAFLD, especially in the development of fibrosis, is still unclear. The early stage of NAFLD is mainly characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, which could lead to severe oxidative stress, causing cellular senescence. In the present study, hepatocytes cultured in the presence of free fatty acids to induce lipid deposition were used as a hepatocyte senescence model in vitro. Senescent hepatocytes significantly increased the activation of co-cultured primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the expression of pro-fibrosis molecules. Moreover, the antioxidant regulator nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that was upregulated in senescent hepatocytes was found to be related to the activation of co-cultured HSCs. The Nrf2 agonist sulforaphane, which upregulated the transcriptional activity of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway, remarkably inhibited hepatocyte senescence and its activation effect on HSCs. However, the liver tissue obtained from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice with Nrf2 knockdown showed decreased antioxidation and significant liver senescence and fibrosis. In conclusion, this study confirmed that lipid accumulation induces hepatocyte senescence, which leads to HSC activation and development of hepatic fibrosis. Increasing the activity of the Nrf2-ARE antioxidant pathway in senescent hepatocytes elicited the opposite effect, suggesting that targeting Nrf2 may prevent or delay the progression of aging-related liver fibrosis in NASH.

Abstract: DYRK1A, one of the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs), plays an important role in various biological processes by regulating downstream targets via kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms. Here, we report a novel role of DYRK1A in maintaining tumor growth and stemness of oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Deletion of DYRK1A from OSCC cells abrogated their in vivo tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity, the key features of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs; also referred to as tumor-initiating cells). The DYRK1A deletion also induced the suppression of CSC populations and properties, such as migration ability and chemoresistance. Conversely, ectopic expression of DYRK1A in OSCC cells augmented their CSC phenotype. Among five DYRK members (DYRK1A, 1B, 2, 3, and 4), DYRK1A is the most dominantly expressed kinase, and its expression is upregulated in OSCC compared to normal oral epithelial cells. More importantly, DYRK1A was highly enriched in various CSC-enriched OSCC populations compared to their corresponding non-CSC populations, indicating its pivotal role in cancer progression and stemness. Further, our study revealed that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a key regulator in the DYRK1A-mediated CSC regulation. Functional studies demonstrated that the loss of DYRK1A inhibits CSC phenotype via reduction of FGF2. Overexpression of DYRK1A promotes CSC phenotype via upregulation of FGF2. Our study delineates a novel mechanism of cancer stemness regulation by DYRK1A-FGF2 axis in OSCC. Thus, inhibition of DYRK1A would lead to a potential novel therapeutic option for targeting CSCs in OSCC.

Abstract: Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been suggested as a novel treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effect remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of Notch signaling, which is crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation in ADSC-mediated treatment of NASH. Flow cytometry analysis of ADSCs showed that they expressed the Notch ligands JAG1, DLL1, and DLL4. The expression of genes associated with the Notch signaling pathway was attenuated in hepatocytes of NASH model mice. We further observed ADSC-mediated activation of Notch signaling in these hepatocytes in addition to an increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen+ cells and a decrease in TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling+ apoptotic cells. Co-culture of palmitic acid-induced steatotic hepatocytes and ADSCs resulted in the activation of Notch signaling and reduction of apoptosis of steatotic hepatocytes. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling by a γ-secretase inhibitor and knockdown of Notch ligands using siRNA attenuated the anti-apoptotic effect of co-cultured ADSCs in vitro. Our findings show that the Notch signaling pathway is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis and restoration of cellular proliferation of hepatocytes from NASH mice following ADSC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
While the standard regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 includes two doses administered 3 weeks apart, some public health authorities are spacing these doses, raising concerns about efficacy. However, data indicate that a single dose can be up to 90% effective starting 14 days post-administration. To assess the mechanisms contributing to protection, we analyzed humoral and T cell responses three weeks after a single BNT162b2 dose. We observed weak neutralizing activity elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals but strong anti-receptor binding domain and spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular CD4+ T cell responses. In previously infected individuals, a single dose boosted all humoral and T cell responses, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Our results highlight the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support for spacing doses to vaccinate more individuals in conditions of vaccine scarcity.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers with an extremely poor prognosis. Gemcitabine (Gem) is still the mainstay drug for the treatment of PDAC. However, rapid inactivation by cytidine deaminase (CDA) present in pancreatic cancer cells severely limits anticancer efficacy of Gem. In this study, we investigated the effect of a CDA inhibitor - Zebularine (Zeb) on anticancer activity of Gem in pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, and Panc-1. Zeb treatment synergistically increased Gem-induced cytotoxicity in all three pancreatic cancer cell lines. The strongest synergistic activity was found at 1:10 M ratio of Gem/Zeb (combination index 0.04–0.4). Additionally, Gem + Zeb treated cells showed marked decreased in the expressions of anti-apoptotic protein including Bcl-2 and survivin while significantly increased the cleaved caspase-3, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed. Multicellular 3D spheroids of MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with combination showed significant reduction (25–60%) in spheroid size, weight compared to single drug and control group. Live/dead cell imaging showed that Gem + Zeb treated spheroids exhibited a highly distorted surface with significantly higher number of dead cells (red). The results of the present study confirm that this synergistic combination is worthy of future investigations as a potential approach for the treatment of PDAC.

Abstract: Retinoblastoma protein (pRB) regulates cell cycle by utilizing different regions of its pocket domain for interacting with E2F family of transcription factors and with cellular and viral proteins containing an LxCxE motif. An LxCxE-like motif, LxCxD, is present in FZR1, an adaptor protein of the multi-subunit E3 ligase complex anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/CFZR1 complex regulates the timely degradation of multiple cell cycle proteins for mitotic exit and maintains G1 state. We report that FZR1 interacts with pRB via its LxCxD motif. By using point mutations, we found that the cysteine residue in the FZR1 LxCxD motif is critical for direct interaction with pRb. The direct binding of the LxCxD motif of FZR1 to the pRB LxCxE binding pocket is confirmed by using human papillomavirus protein E7 as a competitor, both in vitro and in vivo. While mutation of the cysteine residue significantly disrupts FZR1 interaction with pRB, this motif does not affect FZR1 and core APC/C association. Expression of the FZR1 point mutant results in accumulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), while p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 proteins are downregulated, indicating a G1 cell cycle defect. Consistently, cells containing point mutant FZR1 enter the S phase prematurely. Together our results suggest that the LxCxD motif of FZR1 is a critical determinant for the interaction between FZR1 and pRB and is important for G1 restriction.

Abstract: Stalled mRNA translation results in the production of incompletely synthesized proteins that are targeted for degradation by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Here we investigated the fate of defective proteins translated from stall-inducing, nonstop mRNA that escape ubiquitylation by the RQC protein LTN1. We found that nonstop protein products accumulated in nucleoli and this localization was driven by polylysine tracts produced by translation of the poly(A) tails of nonstop mRNA. Nucleolar sequestration increased the solubility of invading proteins but disrupted nucleoli, altering their dynamics, morphology, and resistance to stress in cell culture and intact flies. Our work elucidates how stalled translation may affect distal cellular processes and may inform studies on the pathology of diseases caused by failures in RQC and characterized by nucleolar stress.

Abstract: Summary
Small CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) sensitize HIV-1-infected cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by facilitating antibody recognition of epitopes that are otherwise occluded on the unliganded viral envelope (Env). Combining CD4mc with two families of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, which are frequently found in plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals, stabilizes Env in a conformation that is vulnerable to ADCC. We employed new-generation SRG-15 humanized mice, supporting natural killer (NK) cell and Fc-effector functions to demonstrate that brief treatment with CD4mc and CD4i-Abs significantly decreases HIV-1 replication, the virus reservoir and viral rebound after ART interruption. These effects required Fc-effector functions and NK cells, highlighting the importance of ADCC. Viral rebound was also suppressed in HIV-1+-donor cell-derived humanized mice supplemented with autologous HIV-1+-donor-derived plasma and CD4mc. These results indicate that CD4mc could have therapeutic utility in infected individuals for decreasing the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and/or achieving a functional cure.

Abstract: Proteins in cells undergo repeated binding to other molecules, thereby reducing the apparent extent of their intracellular diffusion. While much effort has been made to analytically decouple these combined effects of pure diffusion and chemical binding, it is difficult with conventional approaches to attribute the measured quantities to the nature of specific domains of the proteins. Motivated by the common goal in cell signaling research aimed at identifying the domains responsible for particular intermolecular interactions, here we describe a framework for determining the local physicochemical properties of cellular proteins associated with immobile scaffolds. To validate this new approach, we apply it to transgelin-2, an actin-binding protein whose intracellular dynamics remains elusive. We develop a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)-based framework, in which comprehensive combinations of domain-deletion mutants are created, and the difference among them in FRAP response is analyzed. We demonstrate that transgelin-2 in actin stress fibers (SFs) interacts with F-actin via two separate domains, and the chemical properties are determined for the individual domains. Its pure diffusion properties independent of the association to F-actin is also obtained. Our approach will thus be useful, as presented here for transgelin-2, in addressing the signaling mechanism of cellular proteins associated with SFs.

Abstract: Summary
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter with broad physiological activities, including protecting cells against stress, but little is known about the regulation of cellular H2S homeostasis. We have performed a high-content small-molecule screen and identified genotoxic agents, including cancer chemotherapy drugs, as activators of intracellular H2S levels. DNA damage-induced H2S in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DNA damage elevated autophagy and upregulated H2S-generating enzyme CGL; chemical or genetic disruption of autophagy or CGL impaired H2S induction. Importantly, exogenous H2S partially rescued autophagy-deficient cells from genotoxic stress. Furthermore, stressors that are not primarily genotoxic (growth factor depletion and mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP) increased intracellular H2S in an autophagy-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the role of autophagy in H2S production and suggest that H2S generation may be a common adaptive response to DNA damage and other stressors.

Abstract: Summary
Current super-resolution microscopy (SRM) methods suffer from an intrinsic complexity that might curtail their routine use in cell biology. We describe here random illumination microscopy (RIM) for live-cell imaging at super-resolutions matching that of 3D structured illumination microscopy, in a robust fashion. Based on speckled illumination and statistical image reconstruction, easy to implement and user-friendly, RIM is unaffected by optical aberrations on the excitation side, linear to brightness, and compatible with multicolor live-cell imaging over extended periods of time. We illustrate the potential of RIM on diverse biological applications, from the mobility of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in U2OS cells and kinetochore dynamics in mitotic S. pombe cells to the 3D motion of myosin minifilaments deep inside Drosophila tissues. RIM's inherent simplicity and extended biological applicability, particularly for imaging at increased depths, could help make SRM accessible to biology laboratories.

Abstract: Parietal epithelial cells (PECs) are epithelial cells in the kidney, surrounding Bowman's space. When activated, PECs increase in cell volume, proliferate, migrate to the glomerular tuft and excrete extracellular matrix. Activated PECs are crucially involved in the formation of sclerotic lesions, seen in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In FSGS, a number of glomeruli show segmental sclerotic lesions. Further disease progression will lead to increasing number of involved glomeruli and gradual destruction of the affected glomeruli. Although the involvement of PECs in FSGS has been acknowledged, little is known about the molecular processes driving PEC activation. To get more insights in this process, accurate in vivo and in vitro models are needed. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a novel conditionally immortalized human PEC (ciPEC) line. We demonstrated that ciPECs are differentiated when grown under growth-restrictive conditions and express important PEC-specific markers, while lacking podocyte and endothelial markers. In addition, ciPECs showed PEC-like morphology and responded to IL-1β treatment. We therefore conclude that we have successfully generated a novel PEC line, which can be used for future studies on the role of PECs in FSGS.

To facilitate drug development, it is desirable to develop in vitro disease models that enable the evaluation of DMD declines in contractile performance. Here, we show MYOD1-induced differentiation of hiPSCs into functional skeletal myotubes in vitro with collagen gel and electrical field stimulation (EFS). Long-term EFS training (0.5 Hz, 20 V, 2 ms, continuous for 2 weeks) mimicking muscle overuse recapitulates declines in contractile performance in dystrophic myotubes. A screening of clinically relevant drugs using this model detects three compounds that ameliorate this decline. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of adapting the model to a 96-well culture system using optogenetic technology for large-scale screening. Our results support a disease model using patient-derived iPSCs that allows for the recapitulation of the contractile pathogenesis of DMD and a screening strategy for drug development.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic dyneins are AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) motor proteins responsible for microtubule minus-end-directed intracellular transport. Dynein's unusually large size, four distinct nucleotide-binding sites, and conformational dynamics pose challenges for the design of potent and selective chemical inhibitors. Here we use structural approaches to develop a model for the inhibition of a well-characterized S. cerevisiae dynein construct by pyrazolo-pyrimidinone-based compounds. These data, along with functional assays of dynein motility and mutagenesis studies, suggest that the compounds inhibit dynein by engaging the regulatory ATPase sites in the AAA3 and AAA4 domains, and not by interacting with dynein's main catalytic site in the AAA1 domain. A double Walker B mutation of the AAA3 and AAA4 sites substantially reduces enzyme activity, suggesting that targeting these regulatory domains is sufficient to inhibit dynein. Our findings reveal how chemical inhibitors can be designed to disrupt allosteric communication across dynein's AAA domains.

Abstract: Self-organization of pluripotent stem cells during tissue formation is directed by the adhesion microenvironment, which defines the resulting tissue topography. Although the influence of tissue topography on pluripotency state has been inferred, this aspect of self-organization remains largely unexplored. In this study, to determine the effect of self-organized tissue topography on pluripotency loss, we designed novel island mesh substrates to confine the self-organization process of mouse embryonic stem cells, enabling us to generate isolated cell layers with an island-like topography and overhanging edges. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we determined that cells at the tissue edge exhibited deformed nuclei associated with low OCT3/4, in contrast with cells nested in the tissue interior which had round-shaped nuclei and exhibited sustained OCT3/4 expression. Interestingly, F-actin and phospho-myosin light chain were visibly enriched at the tissue edge where ERK activation and elevated AP-2γ expression were also found to be localized, as determined using both immunofluorescence microscopy and RT-qPCR analysis. Since actomyosin contractility is known to cause ERK activation, these results suggest that mechanical condition at the tissue edge can contribute to loss of pluripotency leading to differentiation. Thus, our study draws attention to the influence of self-organized tissue topography in stem cell culture and differentiation.

Abstract: Anti-angiogenic therapy represents one of the most promising treatment modalities for human cancers. However, the response to antiangiogenic therapy in gastric cancer (GC) remains dismal. To help identify new strategies for antiangiogenic therapy in GC, we evaluated miR-205–5p expression in GC tissues from TCGA database and our hospital, and its functions in angiogenesis were explored in vitro and in vivo. We investigated miR-205–5p expression and microvessel densities (MVDs) in GC tissues and liver metastases from patients. The function and mechanisms of miR-205–5p were examined in human cell lines and in xenograft mouse models. Associations between miR-205–5p expression and clinical characteristics were analyzed using either Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. Differences in overall survival (OS) distributions were evaluated using the log-rank test. Differences in measurement data were compared using Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. We found that miR-205–5p expression was downregulated in GC tissues and was negatively correlated with CD31 expression in both TCGA and our clinical samples. GC cell lines expressed low levels of miR-205–5p, and miR-205–5p upregulation significantly impaired the proliferation and angiogenesis of GC cells. Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) expression and activation of extracellular-related kinase (ERK) signaling were suppressed by miR-205–5p. MiR-205–5p inhibition promoted malignant phenotypes by enhancing VEGFA and FGF1 expression, as well as the activation of ERK signaling. Angiogenesis and ERK signaling were decreased in response to VEGFA and FGF1 downregulation induced by miR-205–5p overexpression. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that VEGFA and FGF1 were direct targets of miR-205–5p. Xenograft mouse models revealed that miR-205–5p suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting neovascularization. Altogether, these results demonstrate that miR-205–5p suppresses angiogenesis in GC by attenuating the expression of VEGFA and FGF1, indicating that upregulation of miR-205–5p may represent as an antiangiogenic therapy for GC.

Abstract: Drug efficacy assessment without using animals is important for development of cardiac fibrosis treatment. In this study, potential anti-fibrotic drugs were screened in a model of diseased myocardium using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and non-CM in in vitro and in vivo heart failure models. Cardiomyogenic differentiation was induced in hiPSC to generate cardiac tissue, including both iPSC-CM and non-CM expressing fibroblast markers. Stimulation with TGF-β significantly increased cardiac fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, and decreased cardiac contractile/relaxation velocity. Anti-fibrotic HGF significantly decreased fibrotic changes induced by TGF-β. A prostacyclin agonist, ONO-1301 (ONO), camostat mesilate (Cs), and pirfenidone (Pf) significantly decreased fibrotic ECM expression, and improved contraction/relaxation in the model stimulated with TGF-β. Consistent with the in vitro assay, the administration of ONO, Cs, or Pf for 8 weeks in J2N-k hamsters preserved the left ventricular ejection fraction and decreased cardiac fibrosis compared with the controls. The in vitro model simulating fibrotic cardiac tissue showed precise screening of anti-fibrotic drugs which indicated the expected therapeutic response in an in vivo heart failure model, suggesting that the in vitro model presented in this study is a useful tool for the screening of anti-fibrotic drugs.

Abstract: Larynx carcinoma (LC) is the most prevalent head and neck cancer among adults. LC xenograft mouse model was generated to verify the effect of VEGF on macrophage polarization and tumor growth in vivo. EdU assay was performed to measure the cell proliferation. Transwell assay was applied to assess cell migration. The expression of YAP and STAT3 was also significantly increased in LC tumor tissues. Moreover, both YAP and STAT3 overexpression in LC cells promoted the proliferation, migration, as well as the secretion of PD-L1 in M2-like TAMs. Mechanistically, the interaction between YAP and STAT3 facilitated the transcription of VEGF. Moreover, with a co-culture system, VEGF secretion in LC cells enhanced PD-L1 expression in M2-like TAMs via activating VEGFR1-TGFβ signaling pathway. Furthermore, VEGF secreted from LC cells also promoted the tumor growth of LC in vivo. We revealed that dysregulated YAP/STAT3 activity in LC cells could enhance the secretion of VEGF, which then functioned on M2-like TAMs via activating VEGFR1-TGFββ pathway to promote the expression of PD-L1 and immunosuppressive function of M2-like TAMs. Therefore, VEGF and PD-L1 might have a pivotal crosstalk between M2-like TAMs and LC cells, which provided a novel therapeutic target in regulating the metastasis of LC in future.

Abstract: Satellite cells represent the main myogenic population accounting for skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration. While our knowledge of the signaling pathways controlling satellite cell regenerative capability is increasing, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are still not clear, especially in the case of human satellite cells. Here, by performing chromatin accessibility profiling (ATAC-seq) in samples isolated from human and murine muscles, we investigated the changes in the epigenetic landscape occurring during the transition from activated satellite cells to myoblasts. Our analysis identifies a compendium of putative regulatory elements defining human activated satellite cells and myoblasts, respectively. A subset of these differentially accessible loci is shared by both murine and human satellite cells, includes elements associated with known self-renewal regulators, and is enriched for motifs bound by transcription factors participating in satellite cell regulation. Integration of transcriptional and epigenetic data reveals that known regulators of metabolic gene expression, such as PPARGC1A, represent potential PAX7 targets. Through characterization of genomic networks and the underlying effectors, our data represent an important starting point for decoding and manipulating the molecular mechanisms underlying human satellite cell muscle regenerative potential.

Abstract: Summary
Teredinibacter turnerae is an intracellular bacterial symbiont in the gills of wood-eating shipworms, where it is proposed to use antibiotics to defend itself and its animal host. Several biosynthetic gene clusters are conserved in T. turnerae and their host shipworms around the world, implying that they encode defensive compounds. Here, we describe turnercyclamycins, lipopeptide antibiotics encoded in the genomes of all sequenced T. turnerae strains. Turnercyclamycins are bactericidal against challenging Gram-negative pathogens, including colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Phenotypic screening identified the outer membrane as the likely target. Turnercyclamycins and colistin operate by similar cellular, although not necessarily molecular, mechanisms, but turnercyclamycins kill colistin-resistant A. baumannii, potentially filling an urgent clinical need. Thus, by exploring environments that select for the properties we require, we harvested the fruits of evolution to discover compounds with potential to target unmet health needs. Investigating the symbionts of shipworms is a powerful example of this principle.

Abstract: Cytidine triphosphate synthase (CTPS) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo CTP biosynthesis. An intracellular structure of CTPS, the cytoophidium, has been found in many organisms including prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Formation of the cytoophidium has been suggested to regulate the activity and stability of CTPS and may participate in certain physiological events. Herein, we demonstrate that both CTPS1a and CTPS1b in zebrafish are able to form the cytoophidium in cultured cells. A point mutation, H355A, abrogates cytoophidium assembly of zebrafish CTPS1a and CTPS1b. In addition, we show the presence of CTPS cytoophidia in multiple tissues of larval and adult fish under normal conditions, while treatment with a CTPS inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON) can induce more cytoophidia in some tissues. Our findings reveal that forming the CTPS cytoophidium is a natural phenomenon of zebrafish and provide valuable information for future research on the physiological importance of this intracellular structure in vertebrates.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) results from dysregulated metabolism of the extracellular matrix of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and involves the participation of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α. Bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) shows considerable potential for anti-inflammatory applications. Herein, we investigated the role of BRD7 in IDD. The immunohistochemistry results demonstrated decreased BRD7 expression in severely degenerated human NP tissues compared to those showing mild degeneration. Lentiviruses and adenoviruses were used to knock down or overexpress BRD7 and YAP1, respectively. Our results revealed that BRD7 knockdown promoted matrix degradation and suppressed PI3K and YAP1 expression, while BRD7 overexpression alleviated matrix degradation and promoted YAP1 and PI3K expression. In addition, PI3K inhibition augmented matrix degradation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced YAP1 expression, whereas YAP1 overexpression promoted matrix synthesis, suppressed apoptosis and promoted PI3K expression. Besides, BRD7 overexpression reversed the reductions in sulfated glycosaminoglycan levels induced by TNF-α, but this effect was blocked by PI3K or YAP1 inhibitors. Moreover, YAP1 and PI3K were shown to interact through coimmunoprecipitation analysis. In summary, our results demonstrate that BRD7 can regulate matrix metabolism and apoptosis in human NP cells through the BRD7-PI3K-YAP1 signaling axis. This study might provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of IDD.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need to identify which COVID-19 patients will develop life-threatening illness so that medical resources can be optimally allocated and rapid treatment can be administered early in the disease course, when clinical management is most effective. To aid in the prognostic classification of disease severity, we perform untargeted metabolomics on plasma from 339 patients, with samples collected at six longitudinal time points. Using the temporal metabolic profiles and machine learning, we build a predictive model of disease severity. We discover that a panel of metabolites measured at the time of study entry successfully determines disease severity. Through analysis of longitudinal samples, we confirm that most of these markers are directly related to disease progression and that their levels return to baseline upon disease recovery. Finally, we validate that these metabolites are also altered in a hamster model of COVID-19.

Abstract: Objective
ediatric acute leukemia (AL) is the most common hematological malignancy in childhood. However, the limitation of clinical specimens hindered the progress of research. Therefore, new research platforms are urgently needed to establish and clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric AL, and it is necessary to try to find novel targeted therapies for the clinical use. Here, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AL provide a reliable model for basic research.
Methods
eukemia cells were sorted by flow cytometry and then reprogrammed into iPSCs by Sendai virus. Cell cycle assay was used to analyze cell proliferation.
Results
iPS cell lines from T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were successfully established. The reprogramming efficiency of AML cells was much higher than that of ALL cells. Disease iPS cells switched off the expression of the disease marker genes at iPS and HPC stage. When different subtypes of AML-iPSCs were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells, iPS derived from acute megakaryocytic leukemia was more readily differentiated into megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors. Whereas, the differentiation of multipotent lymphoid progenitor (MLP) and granulocyte macrophage progenitor (GMP) were blocked. The iPS derived from acute monocyte leukemia (AMCL) also showed the differentiation of common myeloid progenitors (CMP), GMP and monocytes significantly increased but MLP differentiation was inhibited. The AML-iPSC could form teratomas and we could obverse three germ layers in vivo, indicating that the AML-iPSCs have full pluripotency. However, there were not enough blood cells in teratoma to identify the leukemia.
Conclusions
Our results provide a novel platform for AL research and critical insight into the difference of hematopoietic differentiation between ALL and AML.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related morbidity is associated with a decline in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, but the mechanisms of HSC aging remain unclear. We performed heterochronic HSC transplants followed by quantitative analysis of cell reconstitution. Although young HSCs outperformed old HSCs in young recipients, young HSCs unexpectedly failed to outcompete the old HSCs of aged recipients. Interestingly, despite substantial enrichment of megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) in old mice in situ and reported platelet (Plt) priming with age, transplanted old HSCs were deficient in reconstitution of all lineages, including MkPs and Plts. We therefore performed functional analysis of young and old MkPs. Surprisingly, old MkPs displayed unmistakably greater regenerative capacity compared with young MkPs. Transcriptome analysis revealed putative molecular regulators of old MkP expansion. Collectively, these data demonstrated that aging affects HSCs and megakaryopoiesis in fundamentally different ways: whereas old HSCs functionally decline, MkPs gain expansion capacity upon aging.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting solid tumors must overcome several major obstacles, in particular, the identification of elusive tumor-specific antigens. Here, we devise a strategy to help identify tumor-specific epitopes. Glypican 2 (GPC2) is overexpressed in neuroblastoma. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we show that exon 3 and exons 7–10 of GPC2 are expressed in cancer but are minimally expressed in normal tissues. Accordingly, we discover a monoclonal antibody (CT3) that binds exons 3 and 10 and visualize the complex structure of CT3 and GPC2 by electron microscopy. The potential of this approach is exemplified by designing CT3-derived chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that regress neuroblastoma in mice. Genomic sequencing of T cells recovered from mice reveals the CAR integration sites that may contribute to CAR T cell proliferation and persistence. These studies demonstrate how RNA-seq data can be exploited to help identify tumor-associated exons that can be targeted by CAR T cell therapies.

Abstract: Various proteins in the endometrial epithelium are differentially expressed in the receptive phase and play a pivotal role in embryo implantation. The Protein Disulphide Isomerase (PDI) family contains 21 members that function as chaperone proteins through their redox activities. Although total PDIA1 protein expression was high in four common receptive (Ishikawa and RL95-2) and non-receptive (HEC1-B and AN3CA) endometrial epithelial cell lines, significantly higher membrane PDIA1 expression was found in non-receptive AN3CA cells. In Ishikawa cells, oestrogen up-regulated while progesterone down-regulated membrane PDIA1 expression. Moreover, mid-luteal phase hormone treatment down-regulated membrane PDIA1 expression. Furthermore, oestrogen at 10 nM reduced spheroid attachment on Ishikawa cells. Interestingly, inhibition of PDIA1 function by bacitracin or 16F16 increased the spheroid attachment rate onto non-receptive AN3CA cells. Over-expression of PDIA1 in receptive Ishikawa cells reduced the spheroid attachment rate and significantly down-regulated integrin β3 levels, but not integrin αV and E-cadherin. Addition of reducing agent TCEP induced a sulphydryl-rich microenvironment and increased spheroid attachment onto AN3CA cells and human primary endometrial epithelial cells collected at LH+7/8 days. The luminal epithelial cells from human endometrial biopsies had higher PDIA1 protein expression in the proliferative phase than in the secretory phase. Our findings suggest oestrogen and progesterone regulate PDIA1 expression, resulting in the differential expressions of membrane PDIA1 protein to modulate endometrial receptivity. This suggests that membrane PDIA1 expression prior to embryo transfer could be used to predict endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation in women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM1) is an emerging cancer target with a unique dual expression profile. First, TEM1 is expressed in the stroma and neo-vasculature of many human carcinomas but is largely absent from healthy adult tissues. Second, TEM1 is expressed by tumor cells of mesenchymal origin, notably sarcoma. Here, we present two fully human anti-TEM1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) reagents, namely, 1C1m and 7G22, that recognize distinct regions of the extracellular domain and possess substantially different affinities. In contrast to other, well-described anti-TEM1 binders, these fragments confer cytolytic activity when expressed as 2nd generation chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Moreover, both molecules selectively redirect human T cell effector functions toward TEM1+ tumor cells when incorporated into experimental soluble bispecific trivalent engagers that we term TriloBiTEs (tBs). Furthermore, systemic delivery of 1C1m-tB prevents the establishment of Ewing sarcoma tumors in a xenograft model. Our observations confirm TEM1 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy and illustrate the prospective translational potential of certain scFv-based reagents.

Abstract: Oligodendroglial cells (oligodendrocytes) differentiate to form the myelin that wraps neuronal axons in the central nervous system (CNS). This myelin sheath supports the propagation of saltatory conduction and protects axons from physical stresses. When oligodendrocytes do not normally differentiate to myelinate axons, their key functions as oligodendrocytes in the CNS are severely impaired. The molecular mechanics that control differentiation still remain to be clarified. Arf6 belongs to the small GTPase family and is known to be a positive regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Here, we show that the phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 1 (PIP5K1) molecules, the major effectors of Arf6, are involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Knockdown of PLD1 or PIP5K type 1γ (PIP5K1C) by their respective specific siRNAs in mouse oligodendroglial FBD-102b cells inhibited morphological differentiation into structures bearing myelin-like processes; this finding is consistent with the concurrent changes in expression of differentiation and myelin marker proteins. Treatment with VU0155069 or UNC3230, specific inhibitors of PLD and PIP5K1, respectively, blunted morphological differentiation and decreased expression of myelin and differentiation marker proteins. Similar results have been obtained in studies using primary oligodendrocytes. These results suggest that the major Arf6 effector molecules PLD and PIP5K1 are among the molecules involved in the regulation of morphological differentiation in oligodendrocytes prior to myelination.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative information about the levels and dynamics of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is critical for an understanding of cellular functions. Protein arginine methylation (ArgMet) is an important subclass of PTMs and is involved in a plethora of (patho)physiological processes. However, because of the lack of methods for global analysis of ArgMet, the link between ArgMet levels, dynamics, and (patho)physiology remains largely unknown. We utilized the high sensitivity and robustness of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to develop a general method for the quantification of global protein ArgMet. Our NMR-based approach enables the detection of protein ArgMet in purified proteins, cells, organoids, and mouse tissues. We demonstrate that the process of ArgMet is a highly prevalent PTM and can be modulated by small-molecule inhibitors and metabolites and changes in cancer and during aging. Thus, our approach enables us to address a wide range of biological questions related to ArgMet in health and disease.

Abstract: In this study, we explored the regulatory effects of nitrogen permease regulator 2-like (NPRL2) on niraparib sensitivity, a PARP inhibitor (PARPi) in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program were retrospectively examined. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted between high and low NRPL2 expression prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cases in TCGA. CCK-8 assay, Western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins, and flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis were applied to test niraparib sensitivity. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were conducted to explore the proteins interacting with NPRL2. Results showed that the upregulation of a canonical protein-coding transcript of NPRL2 (ENST00000232501.7) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Bioinformatic analysis predicts a physical interaction between NPRL2 and UBE2M, which is validated by a following Co-IP assay. This interaction increases NPRL2 stability by reducing polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion of NPRL2 or UBE2M significantly increases the niraparib sensitivity of CRPC cells and enhances niraparib-induced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. NPRL2 cooperatively enhances UBE2M-mediated neddylation and facilitates the degradation of multiple substrates of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). In conclusion, this study identified a novel NPRL2-UBE2M complex in modulating neddylation and niraparib sensitivity of CRPC cells. Therefore, targeting NPRL2 might be considered as an adjuvant strategy for PARPi therapy.

Abstract: Anesthetics such as isoflurane are known to cause apoptosis in the developing mammalian brain. However, isoflurane may have protective effects on the heart via relieving ischemia and downregulating genes related to apoptosis. Ischemic preconditioning, e.g. through the use of low levels of carbon monoxide (CO), has promise in preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury and cell death. However, it is still unclear how it either triggers the stress response in neonatal hearts. For this reason, thirty-three microRNAs (miRNAs) known to be differentially expressed following anesthesia and/or ischemic or hypoxic heart damage were investigated in the hearts from neonatal mice exposed to isoflurane or low level of CO, using an air-exposed control group. Only miR-93-5p increased with isoflurane exposure, which may be associated with the suppression of cell death, autophagy, and inflammation. By contrast, twelve miRNAs were differentially expressed in the heart following CO treatment. Many miRNAs previously shown to be responsible for suppressing cell death, autophagy, and myocardial hypertrophy were upregulated (e.g., 125b-3p, 19-3p, and 21a-5p). Finally, some miRNAs (miR-103-3p, miR-1a-3p, miR-199a-1-5p) which have been implicated in regulating energy balance and cardiac contraction were also differentially expressed. Overall, this study demonstrated that CO-mediated miRNA regulation may promote ischemic preconditioning and cardioprotection based on the putative protective roles of the differentially expressed miRNAs explored herein and the consistency of these results with those that have shown positive effects of CO on heart viability following anesthesia and ischemia-reperfusion stress.

Abstract: Aberrant NF-κB activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with breast cancer progression. How NF-κB and NETs modulate each other in breast cancer development remains unclear. Here, we found that NETs induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate promote breast cancer cell progression. In turn, cancer cells–derived factors, such as IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, stimulate neutrophils to form NETs. Mechanistically, NETs increased the interaction of NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO) with IκB kinase (IKK)α/β and enhanced NF-κB activation. We then employed a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the NEMO-binding domain (NBD) of IKKα/β, termed NBD peptide, which disrupts NETs-mediated NEMO interaction with IKKα/β and abolished NF-κB activation in vitro. NBD peptide also reduced IL-8 level and NETs formation, and suppressed primary tumor growth and/or lung metastasis in human breast cancer mouse xenograft models and mouse spontaneous breast cancer model. Blockade of NET formation using a peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) pharmacologic inhibitor decreased NF-κB activation and tumor metastasis. Collectively, these data suggest that NF-κB associates with NETs to form a positive loop facilitating breast tumor progression and metastasis, and that selective inhibition of NF-κB and PAD4-dependent NETs provides an effective therapeutic approach for treating breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
A primary goal of the US National Cancer Institute's Ras initiative at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research is to develop methods to quantify RAS signaling to facilitate development of novel cancer therapeutics. We use targeted proteomics technologies to develop a community resource consisting of 256 validated multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based, multiplexed assays for quantifying protein expression and phosphorylation through the receptor tyrosine kinase, MAPK, and AKT signaling networks. As proof of concept, we quantify the response of melanoma (A375 and SK-MEL-2) and colorectal cancer (HCT-116 and HT-29) cell lines to BRAF inhibition by PLX4720. These assays replace over 60 western blots with quantitative mass-spectrometry-based assays of high molecular specificity and quantitative precision, showing the value of these methods for pharmacodynamic measurements and mechanism-of-action studies. Methods, fit-for-purpose validation, and results are publicly available as a resource for the community at assays.cancer.gov.

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major subtype of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). LINC00680 has been characterized as a novel oncogenic lncRNA in LUAD, but its regulatory mechanisms remain largely unclear. This study aimed to explore the subcellular localization of LINC00680 in LUAD and its regulation on the transcriptional process. LUAD cell lines (A549, H1650, and H1299) were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Results showed LINC00680 depletion resulted in G0/G1 phase arrest of LUAD cells and reduced CDK4 and cyclin D1 expression in H1650 and H1299 cells. LINC00680 overexpression promoted A549 cell proliferation and increased CDK4 and cyclin D1 expression. RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay showed that LINC00680 has both cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in LUAD cells. RNA pulldown and western blotting assays confirmed a physical interaction between LINC00680 and GATA6. In LUAD cells, GATA6 overexpression only slightly suppressed SOX12 transcription. ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase assay showed that GATA6 only weakly bound to the SOX12 promoter and decreased its activity. However, when LINC00680 was depleted, these transcriptional suppressive effects were significantly enhanced. These findings suggested that LINC00680 forms a complex with GATA6 and weakens its transcriptional suppressive effect on SOX12 expression. In the nude mice model, LINC00680 overexpression partly abrogated the growth-suppressive effects of GATA6 on A549 derived tumors. In summary, this study revealed a novel LINC00680-GATA6-SOX12 axis in promoting LUAD cell cycle progression and proliferation. Future studies should be conducted for a better understanding of the complex networking of LINC00680 in LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an accelerating global threat, yet the nature of AMR in the gut microbiome and how AMR is acquired during early life remain largely unknown. In a cohort of 662 Danish children, we characterized the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) acquired during the first year of life and assessed the impacts of diverse environmental exposures on ARG load. Our study reveals a clear bimodal distribution of ARG richness that is driven by the composition of the gut microbiome, especially E. coli. ARG profiles were significantly affected by various environmental factors. Among these factors, the importance of antibiotics diminished with time since treatment. Finally, ARG load and ARG clusters were also associated with the maturity of the gut microbiome and a bacterial composition associated with increased risk of asthma. These findings broaden our understanding of AMR in early life and have critical implications for efforts to mitigate its spread.

Abstract: Summary
Small molecules can be imaged in living cells using biosensors composed of RNA. However, RNA-based devices are difficult to design. Here, we describe a versatile platform for designing RNA-based fluorescent small-molecule sensors using naturally occurring highly stable three-way junction RNAs. We show that ligand-binding aptamers and fluorogenic aptamers can be inserted into three-way junctions and connected in a way that enables the three-way junction to function as a small-molecule-regulated fluorescent sensor in vitro and in cells. The sensors are designed so that the interhelical stabilizing interactions in the three-way junction are only induced upon ligand binding. We use these RNA-based devices to measure the dynamics of S-adenosylmethionine levels in mammalian cells in real time. We show that this strategy is compatible with diverse metabolite-binding RNA aptamers, fluorogenic aptamers, and three-way junctions. Overall, these data demonstrate a versatile method for readily generating RNA devices that function in living cells.

Abstract: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCPGs) are catecholamine-producing neuroendocrine tumors. Accumulating evidences indicate that the blockade of antioxidative pathways might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of PCPG. NIX has been confirmed to play a key role in maintaining redox homeostasis in tumors, while the function of NIX in PCPG remains unclear. In this study, the analyses of the disease-free survival (DFS) showed that high NIX protein level is related to poor prognosis in patients of PCPG. Consistent with this, high level of NIX protein upregulates the level of p-NF-κB and promotes the migration of PC12 cells. In NIX-over-expressing PC12 cells, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is decreased while trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) increased. But in NIX-silencing cells, ROS level is increased, while TEAC reversely reduced, consequently antioxidase and phase II enzymes of NRF2 signaling were activated, and elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was observed. Additionally, the apoptosis induced by luminespib/NVP-AUY922, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90, a cellular stress response factor), was enhanced in NIX-silencing cells but reduced in the NIX-over-expressing cells. All of these results indicated that high NIX protein level enhances antioxidant capacity of PC12 cells and reduces the apoptosis caused by cell stress, such as induced by luminespib/NVP-AUY922. Therefore, luminespib/NVP-AUY922 might be effective only for PCPG with low NIX level, while targeting NIX could be a further supplement to the therapeutic treatment strategy for PCPG patients with high NIX protein level.

Abstract: Inadequate trophoblast proliferation, shallow invasion and exaggerated rate of trophoblast apoptosis are implicated in early recurrent miscarriage (ERM). However, the mechanistic bases of this association have not been fully established. We aimed at investigating the involvement of fascin, an actin-bundling protein, in trophoblast activities and ERM. We found that fascin was downregulated in the cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and distal cytotrophoblasts (DCTs) of ERM placentae. Knockdown of fascin altered cellular and nucleolar morphology, and inhibited the proliferation but increased apoptosis of trophoblastic HTR8/SVneo cells. Furthermore, fascin knockdown decreased the expression of transcription factors such as Snail1/2, Twist and Zeb1/2, mesenchymal molecules such as Vimentin and N-cadherin, and the protein expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcript 3 (STAT3). Exposure of HTR-8/SVneo cells to hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) decreased fascin expression to affect the cells’ invasion. Our results indicate for the first time that the downregulation of fascin is involved in the pathogenesis of early recurrent miscarriage; and hence a potential therapeutic target against the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the introduction of public health measures and spike protein-based vaccines to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths continue to have a global impact. Previously, we used a structural design approach to develop picomolar range miniproteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain. Here, we investigated the capacity of modified versions of one lead miniprotein, LCB1, to protect against SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung disease in mice. Systemic administration of LCB1-Fc reduced viral burden, diminished immune cell infiltration and inflammation, and completely prevented lung disease and pathology. A single intranasal dose of LCB1v1.3 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung when given as many as 5 days before or 2 days after virus inoculation. Importantly, LCB1v1.3 protected in vivo against a historical strain (WA1/2020), an emerging B.1.1.7 strain, and a strain encoding key E484K and N501Y spike protein substitutions. These data support development of LCB1v1.3 for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Karyopherin beta 1 (Kpnβ1) is a major nuclear import receptor that mediates the import of cellular cargoes into the nucleus. Recently it has been shown that Kpnβ1 is highly expressed in several cancers, and its inhibition by siRNA induces apoptotic cancer cell death, while having little effect on non-cancer cells. This study investigated the effect of a novel small molecule, Inhibitor of Nuclear Import-60 (INI-60), on cancer cell biology, as well as nuclear import activities associated with Kpnβ1, and cancer progression in vivo using cervical and oesophageal cancer cell lines. INI-60 treatment resulted in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and induced a G1/S cell cycle arrest, followed by cancer cell death via apoptosis. Non-cancer cells were minimally affected by INI-60 at concentrations that inhibited cancer cells. INI-60 treatment altered the localisation of Kpnβ1 and its cargoes, NFκB/p65, NFAT and AP-1, and the overexpression of Kpnβ1 reduced INI-60 cytotoxicity. INI-60 also inhibited KYSE 30 oesophageal cancer cell line growth in vivo. Taken together, these results show that INI-60 inhibits the nuclear import of Kpnβ1 cargoes and interferes with cancer cell biology. INI-60 presents as a potential therapeutic approach for cancers of different tissue origins and warrants further investigation as a novel anti-cancer agent.

Abstract: White matter stroke (WMS) occurs as small infarcts in deep penetrating blood vessels in the brain and affects the regions of the brain that carry connections, termed the subcortical white matter. WMS progresses over years and has devastating clinical consequences. Unlike large grey matter strokes, WMS disrupts the axonal architecture of the brain and depletes astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, axons and myelinating cells, resulting in abnormalities of gait and executive function. An astrocytic cell-based therapy is positioned as a strong therapeutic candidate after WMS. In this study we report, the reliable generation of a novel stem cell-based therapeutic product, glial enriched progenitors (GEPs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). By transient treatment of hiPSC derived neural progenitors (hiPSC-NPCs) with the small molecule deferoxamine, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, for three days hiPSC-NPCs become permanently biased towards an astrocytic fate, producing hiPSC-GEPs. In preparation for clinical application, we have developed qualification assays to ensure identity, safety, purity, and viability of the cells prior to manufacture. Using tailored q-RT-PCR-based assays, we have demonstrated the lack of pluripotency in our final therapeutic candidate cells (hiPSC-GEPs) and we have identified the unique genetic profile of hiPSC-GEPs that is clearly distinct from the parent lines, hiPSCs and iPSC-NPCs. After completion of the viability assay, we have stablished the therapeutic window of use for hiPSC-GEPs in future clinical applications (7 h). Lastly, we were able to reliably and consistently produce a safe therapeutic final product negative for contamination by any human or murine viral pathogens, selected bacteria, common laboratory mycoplasmas, growth of any aerobes, anaerobes, yeast, or fungi and 100 times less endotoxin levels than the maximum acceptable value. This study demonstrates the reliable and safe generation of patient derived hiPSC-GEPs that are clinically ready as a cell-based therapeutic approach for WMS.

Abstract: Summary
Central nervous system injury and neurodegenerative diseases cause irreversible loss of neurons. Overexpression of exogenous specific transcription factors can reprogram somatic cells into functional neurons for regeneration and functional reconstruction. However, these practices are potentially problematic due to the integration of vectors into the host genome. Here, we showed that the activation of endogenous genes Ngn2 and Isl1 by CRISPRa enabled reprogramming of mouse spinal astrocytes and embryonic fibroblasts to motor neurons. These induced neurons showed motor neuronal morphology and exhibited electrophysiological activities. Furthermore, astrocytes in the spinal cord of the adult mouse can be converted into motor neurons by this approach with high efficiency. These results demonstrate that the activation of endogenous genes is sufficient to induce astrocytes into functional motor neurons in vitro and in vivo. This direct neuronal reprogramming approach may provide a novel potential therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injury.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering epigenetic regulation of gene expression requires measuring the epigenome and transcriptome jointly. Single-cell multi-omics technologies have been developed for concurrent profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression. However, multi-omics profiling of low-input bulk samples remains challenging. Therefore, we developed low-input ATAC&mRNA-seq, a simple and robust method for studying the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation in a single experiment with thousands of cells, to maximize insights from limited input material by obtaining ATAC-seq and mRNA-seq data simultaneously from the same cells with data quality comparable to that of conventional mono-omics assays. Integrative data analysis revealed similar strong association between promoter accessibility and gene expression when using the data of low-input ATAC&mRNA-seq as when using single-assay data, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of our dual-omics assay to generate both datum types simultaneously with just thousands of cells. We envision our method to be widely applied in many biological disciplines with limited materials.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common gastrointestinal cancer globally. Prevention of tumor cell proliferation and metastasis is vital for prolonging patient survival. Polyphenols provide a wide range of health benefits and prevention from cancer. In the gut, urolithins are the major metabolites of polyphenols. The objective of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anticancer effect of urolithin A (UA) on colorectal cancer cells. UA was found to inhibit the cell proliferation of CRC cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in HT29, SW480, and SW620 cells. Exposure to UA resulted in cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner along with alteration in the expression of cell cycle–related protein. Treatment of CRC cell lines with UA resulted in the induction of apoptosis. Treatment of HT29, SW480, and SW620 with UA resulted in increased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, p53 and p21. Similarly, UA treatment inhibited the anti-apoptotic protein expression of Bcl-2. Moreover, exposure of UA induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Furthermore, UA was found to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CRC cells. These findings indicate that UA possesses anticancer potential and may be used therapeutically for the treatment of CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in therapeutic neuromodulation devices have enabled concurrent stimulation and electrophysiology in the central nervous system. However, stimulation artifacts often obscure the sensed underlying neural activity. Here, we develop a method, termed Period-based Artifact Reconstruction and Removal Method (PARRM), to remove stimulation artifacts from neural recordings by leveraging the exact period of stimulation to construct and subtract a high-fidelity template of the artifact. Benchtop saline experiments, computational simulations, five unique in vivo paradigms across animal and human studies, and an obscured movement biomarker are used for validation. Performance is found to exceed that of state-of-the-art filters in recovering complex signals without introducing contamination. PARRM has several advantages: (1) it is superior in signal recovery; (2) it is easily adaptable to several neurostimulation paradigms; and (3) it has low complexity for future on-device implementation. Real-time artifact removal via PARRM will enable unbiased exploration and detection of neural biomarkers to enhance efficacy of closed-loop therapies.

Abstract: RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 is involved in cell proliferation and invasion in a variety of tumors. However, the expression, function, and mechanism of NSUN2 in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) remains unknown. We used a bioinformatics database, polymerase chain reaction, cell culture and transfection, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation assay, wound healing experiments, transwell assays, western blotting, RNA-seq detection, dual-luciferase reporter assay, in vivo experiments, and a dot blot assay to evaluate the role of NSUN2 in HPSCC. NSUN2 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in HPSCC; NSUN2 knockdown in vitro and in vivo decreased cell proliferation and invasion. Studies have shown that TEAD1, a transcription factor, may act downstream of NSUN2 in HPSCC. NSUN2 was found to promote the proliferation and invasion of HPSCC by upregulating TEAD1 in an 5-methylcytosine-dependent manner, thereby representing an oncogene and potential new target for treating HPSCC.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells can be accomplished by sequential activation of signaling pathways or through transcription factor programming. Multistep differentiation imitates embryonic development to obtain authentic cell types, but it suffers from asynchronous differentiation with variable efficiency. Transcription factor programming induces synchronous and efficient differentiation with higher reproducibility but may not always yield authentic cell types. We systematically explored the generation of dopaminergic induced neuronal cells from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. We found that the proneural factor Ascl1 in combination with mesencephalic factors Lmx1a and Nurr1 induce peripheral dopaminergic neurons. Co-delivery of additional midbrain transcription factors En1, FoxA2, and Pitx3 resulted in facile and robust generation of functional dopaminergic neurons of midbrain character. Our results suggest that more complex combinations of transcription factors may be needed for proper regional specification of induced neuronal cells generated by direct lineage induction.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic screening technologies to identify and validate macromolecular interactions (MMIs) essential for complex pathways remain an important unmet need for systems biology and therapeutics development. Here, we use a library of peptides from diverse prokaryal genomes to screen MMIs promoting the nuclear relocalization of Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3a), a tumor suppressor more frequently inactivated by post-translational modification than mutation. A hit peptide engages the 14-3-3 family of signal regulators through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction, modulates FOXO3a-mediated transcription, and suppresses cancer cell growth. In a crystal structure, the hit peptide occupies the phosphopeptide-binding groove of 14-3-3ε in a conformation distinct from its natural peptide substrates. A biophysical screen identifies drug-like small molecules that displace the hit peptide from 14-3-3ε, providing starting points for structure-guided development. Our findings exemplify “protein interference,” an approach using evolutionarily diverse, natural peptides to rapidly identify, validate, and develop chemical probes against MMIs essential for complex cellular phenotypes.

Abstract: The interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) pathway modulates immune response and inflammation, associated with allograft dysfunction and rejection. We hypothesized that IL-33/ST2 is a marker of renal allograft rejection and IL-33/ST2 expression may differ according to rejection type. IL-33/ST2 expression was measured in sera and kidney tissues from recipients with acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR), acute cell-mediated rejection (ACMR), chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR), and healthy controls. The soluble ST2 and IL-33/ST2 expression levels were higher in participants with all three rejection types than in controls. Although the expression levels in recipients with AAMR and ACMR were significantly higher than those with CAMR, there was no significant difference between the expression levels in AAMR and ACMR. Although IL-33, IL-8, and fibronectin expression were significantly increased after the addition of the recipients’ serum in primary cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, the levels decreased after treatment with an anti-ST2 antibody. Furthermore, the anti-ST2 antibody specifically suppressed the upregulation of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Boyden chamber assays demonstrated that anti-ST2 antibody abrogated chemotaxis induced by recombinant IL-33. Thus, IL-33 and ST2 are potent mediators of rejection. Treatment with an anti-ST2 antibody ameliorates rejection and could be a potential therapeutic strategy for renal allograft rejection.

Abstract: Summary
PARK2 (parkin) mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that participates in several cellular functions, including mitochondrial homeostasis. However, the specific metabolomic changes caused by parkin depletion remain unknown. Here, we used isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with and without PARK2 knockout (KO) to investigate the effect of parkin loss of function by comparative metabolomics supplemented with ultrastructural and functional analyses. PARK2 KO neurons displayed increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, perturbed mitochondrial ultrastructure, ATP depletion, and dysregulation of glycolysis and carnitine metabolism. These perturbations were combined with increased oxidative stress and a decreased anti-oxidative response. Key findings for PARK2 KO cells were confirmed using patient-specific iPSC-derived neurons. Overall, our data describe a unique metabolomic profile associated with parkin dysfunction and show that combining metabolomics with an iPSC-derived dopaminergic neuronal model of PD is a valuable approach to obtain novel insight into the disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulate glucose and energy homeostasis. Targeting both pathways with GIP receptor (GIPR) antagonist antibody (GIPR-Ab) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, by generating GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 bispecific molecules, is an approach for treating obesity and its comorbidities. In mice and monkeys, these molecules reduce body weight (BW) and improve many metabolic parameters. BW loss is greater with GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 than with GIPR-Ab or a control antibody conjugate, suggesting synergistic effects. GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 also reduces the respiratory exchange ratio in DIO mice. Simultaneous receptor binding and rapid receptor internalization by GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 amplify endosomal cAMP production in recombinant cells expressing both receptors. This may explain the efficacy of the bispecific molecules. Overall, our GIPR-Ab/GLP-1 molecules promote BW loss, and they may be used for treating obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Case fatality among African children with severe acute malnutrition remains high. We report a 3-arm pilot trial in 58 Ugandan children, comparing feeds targeting disordered gastrointestinal function containing cowpea (CpF, n = 20) or inulin (InF, n = 20) with conventional feeds (ConF, n = 18). Baseline measurements of gut permeability (lactulose:mannitol ratio 1.19 ± SD 2.00), inflammation (fecal calprotectin 539.0 μg/g, interquartile range [IQR] 904.8), and satiety (plasma polypeptide YY 62.6 pmol/l, IQR 110.3) confirm gastrointestinal dysfunction. By day 28, no differences are observable in proportion achieving weight gain >5 g/kg/day (87%, 92%, 86%; p > 0.05), mortality (16%, 30%, 17%; p > 0.05), or edema resolution (83%, 54%, 91%; p > 0.05) among CpF, InF, and ConF. Decreased fecal bacterial richness from day 1 (abundance-based coverage estimator [ACE] 53.2) to day 7 (ACE 40.8) is observed only in ConF (p = 0.025). Bifidobacterium relative abundance increases from day 7 (5.8% ± 8.6%) to day 28 (10.9% ± 8.7%) in CpF (corrected p = 1.000). Legume-enriched feeds support aspects of gut function and the microbiome.

Abstract: β-Glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been described to be effective antioxidants, but the specific antioxidation mechanism of β-glucan is unclear. The objectives of this research were to determine whether the β-glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae could regulate oxidative stress through the Dectin-1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In this study, we examined the effects of β-glucan on the enzyme activity or production of oxidative stress indicators in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells by biochemical analysis and the protein expression of key factors of Dectin-1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by immunofluorescence and western blot. The biochemical analysis results showed that β-glucan increased the LPS-induced downregulation of enzyme activity of intracellular heme oxygenase (HO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) while decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, immunofluorescence results showed that β-glucan can activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The antioxidant mechanism study indicated that β-glucan activated dendritic-cell-associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1) receptors mediated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby downregulating the production of ROS and thus produced the antioxidant effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that β-glucan potently alleviated oxidative stress via Dectin-1/Nrf2/HO-1 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

Abstract: Melanoma, which originates from neural crest derived melanocytes, causes severe pain and even death to numerous patients. Previous studies reported that Notchless Homolog 1 (NLE1) plays an important role in cell proliferation, transcription and signal transduction. However, the clinical significance and biological behavior of NLE1 in melanoma remain a mystery. Thus, the role of NLE1 in melanoma was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The expression of NLE1 in melanoma was elevated and the expression level was positively correlated with lymphatic metastasis and tumor stage. In addition, NLE1 knockdown by shRNA specifically inhibited proliferation, enhanced the apoptotic sensitivity and hindered migration of melanoma cells in vitro. Mice xenograft model further showed that NLE1 knockdown could inhibit the tumor formation of melanoma in vivo. Additionally, the induction of apoptosis of melanoma cells by NLE1 knockdown required the participation of a series of apoptosis-related proteins. Besides, NLE1 can activate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In summary, NLE1 was involved in the development and progression of melanoma, which may be a novel potential target for molecular therapy of melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-derived cell lines are often used in pre-clinical cancer research, but some cell lines are too different from tumors to be good models. Comparison of genomic and expression profiles can guide the choice of pre-clinical models, but typically not all features are equally relevant. We present TumorComparer, a computational method for comparing cellular profiles with higher weights on functional features of interest. In this pan-cancer application, we compare ∼600 cell lines and ∼8,000 tumor samples of 24 cancer types, using weights to emphasize known oncogenic alterations. We characterize the similarity of cell lines and tumors within and across cancers by using multiple datum types and rank cell lines by their inferred quality as representative models. Beyond the assessment of cell lines, the weighted similarity approach is adaptable to patient stratification in clinical trials and personalized medicine.

Abstract: Cisplatin (CDDP) is the first generation of platinum-based drug and is widely used to treat many cancers due to its potency. The present study aims to explore the effects of CDDP on lung carcinoma and its relationship with macrophage phagocytosis. In in vitro study, murine and human lung cancer cell lines were applied and treated with CDDP, CD47 antibody (aCD47), or CDDP plus aCD47. In in vivo study, a tumor xenograft animal model was treated with CDDP, aCD47, or CDDP plus aCD47. Real-time PCR was applied to determine the mRNA expressions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and Immunofluorescent staining were applied to determine the protein expressions. Flow cytometry was applied to analyze cell apoptosis, phagocytosis, and specific cell populations. CDDP enhanced the expressions of CD47 in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, the blockage of CD47 enhanced the macrophages' phagocytic activity on the CDDP-treated tumor cells. The treatment of CDDP and aCD47 exhibited anti-tumor effects and prolonged the LLC tumor-bearing mice survival time. Mechanistic studies revealed that the treatment of CDDP and aCD47 regulated the phagocytic activity of macrophage, percentage of CD8+ T cells, and cytokines (tumor growth factor (TGF)-β, interleukin (IL)12p70, and interferon (IFN)-γ) in the tumor-bearing model. CD47 blockade enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin against lung carcinoma in vivo and in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Omics experiments are ubiquitous in biological studies, leading to a deluge of data. However, it is still challenging to connect changes in these data to changes in cell functions because of complex interdependencies between genes, proteins, and metabolites. Here, we present a framework allowing researchers to infer how metabolic functions change on the basis of omics data. To enable this, we curated and standardized lists of metabolic tasks that mammalian cells can accomplish. Genome-scale metabolic networks were used to define gene sets associated with each metabolic task. We further developed a framework to overlay omics data on these sets and predict pathway usage for each metabolic task. We demonstrated how this approach can be used to quantify metabolic functions of diverse biological samples from the single cell to whole tissues and organs by using multiple transcriptomic datasets. To facilitate its adoption, we integrated the approach into GenePattern (www.genepattern.org—CellFie).

Abstract: Leptin is an adipokine of pleiotropic effects linked to energy metabolism, satiety, the immune response, and cardioprotection. We have recently shown that leptin causally conferred resistance to myocardial infarction-induced damage in transgenic αMUPA mice overexpressing leptin compared to their wild type (WT) ancestral mice FVB/N. Prompted by these findings, we have investigated here if leptin can counteract the inflammatory response triggered after LPS administration in tissues in vivo and in cardiomyocytes in culture. The results have shown that LPS upregulated in vivo and in vitro all genes examined here, both pro-inflammatory and antioxidant, as well as the leptin gene. Pretreating mice with leptin neutralizing antibodies further upregulated the expression of TNFα and IL-1β in the adipose tissue of both mouse types, and in the αMUPA heart. The antibodies also increased the levels of serum markers for cell toxicity in both mouse types. These results indicate that under LPS, leptin actually reduced the levels of these inflammatory-related parameters. In addition, pretreatment with leptin antibodies reduced the levels of HIF-1α and VEGF mRNAs in the heart, indicating that under LPS leptin increased the levels of these mRNAs. In cardiomyocytes, pretreatment with exogenous leptin prior to LPS reduced the expression of both pro-inflammatory genes, enhanced the expression of the antioxidant genes HO-1, SOD2 and HIF-1α, and lowered ROS staining. In addition, results obtained with leptin antibodies and the SMLA leptin antagonist indicated that endogenous and exogenous leptin can inhibit leptin gene expression. Together, these findings have indicated that under LPS, leptin concomitantly downregulated pro-inflammatory genes, upregulated antioxidant genes, and lowered ROS levels.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset incurable motor neuron (MN) disease. The reasons for selective MN vulnerability in ALS are unknown. Axonal pathology is among the earliest signs of ALS. We searched for novel modulatory genes in human MN axon shortening affected by TARDBP mutations. In transcriptome analysis of RNA present in the axon compartment of human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs, PHOX2B (paired-like homeobox protein 2B) showed lower expression in TARDBP mutant axons, which was consistent with axon qPCR and in situ hybridization. PHOX2B mRNA stability was reduced in TARDBP mutant MNs. Furthermore, PHOX2B knockdown reduced neurite length in human MNs. Finally, phox2b knockdown in zebrafish induced short spinal axons and impaired escape response. PHOX2B is known to be highly express in other types of neurons maintained after ALS progression. Collectively, TARDBP mutations induced loss of axonal resilience, which is an important ALS-related phenotype mediated by PHOX2B downregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Costello syndrome (CS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in HRAS. Although CS patients have skeletal abnormalities, the role of mutated HRAS in bone development remains unclear. Here, we use CS induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) undergoing osteogenic differentiation to investigate how dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling proteins contributes to impaired osteogenesis. Although CS patient-derived iPSCs develop normally to produce mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the resulting CS MSCs show defective osteogenesis with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and lower levels of bone mineralization. We found that hyperactivation of SMAD3 signaling during the osteogenic differentiation of CS MSCs leads to aberrant expression of ECM remodeling proteins such as MMP13, TIMP1, and TIMP2. CS MSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation also show reduced β-catenin signaling. Knockdown of TIMPs permits normal differentiation of CS MSCs into osteoblasts and enhances β-catenin signaling in a RUNX2-independent manner. Thus, this study demonstrates that enhanced TIMP expression induced by hyperactivated SMAD3 signaling impairs the osteogenic development of CS MSCs via an inactivation of β-catenin signaling.

Abstract: Background
Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation/activation is central to liver fibrosis and is innately linked to the immune response to liver injury. Exosomes (EXOs) are important means of communication between cell populations. This study sought to characterize EXO release from HSCs and the effect of HSC-EXOs on macrophage cytokine release/function.
Methods
Liver from a rat fibrosis model was analyzed for EXO expression and localization. Quiescent and culture-activated rat and mouse HSCs and activated human HSCs were analyzed for microRNA expression. Mouse, rat, and human HSCs were culture-activated and EXOs purified from culture medium prior to addition to macrophages, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNA and protein measured. The effect of activated HSC-EXOs on macrophage migration was assayed.
Results
Activation of rat HSCs led to increased EXO production in vivo, an effect mirrored by in vitro rat HSC culture-activation. Culture activation of mouse and rat HSCs led to altered EXO microRNA profiles, with a similar microRNA profile detected in activated human HSCs. Addition of activated HSC-EXOs to macrophages stimulated IL-6 and TNFα mRNA expression and protein secretion in mouse and human macrophages, but not for rat HSC-EXO-macrophages. Addition of human EXOs to macrophages stimulated migration, effects mirrored by the direct addition of rhIL-6 and rhTNFα.
Conclusions
HSC-EXOs associate with macrophages and stimulate cytokine synthesis-release and macrophage migration. Constructing a comprehensive understanding of EXO interactions between liver cell populations in the setting of inflammation/fibrosis increases the potential for developing new diagnostic/therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease, until now, is still the leading cause of death in the United States. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of adult hearts, the damage caused by heart injury cannot be reversed and eventually progress into heart failure. In need of cardiovascular disease treatment, many therapies aimed at either cell transplantation or cell regeneration have been proposed. Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) is considered to be a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. The induction of cardiomyocytes from non-myocytes can be achieved efficiently via ectopic expression of reprogramming factors both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse model, however, the generation of human induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (hiCMs) remains challenging. The inefficiency of hiCMs production called for the identification of the additional epigenetic memories in non-myocytes which might be damping the hiCM reprogramming. Here, we conducted an unbiased loss-of-function screening focusing on epigenetic regulators and identified enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as an important epigenetic barrier during hiCM reprogramming. We found that the removal of EZH2 via genetic knockdown or treatment of EZH2 selective degrader significantly increased the hiCM reprogramming efficiency and led to profound activation of cardiac genes and repression of collagen and extracellular matrix genes. Furthermore, EZH2 inhibitors targeting its catalytic activity also promotes hiCM reprogramming, suggesting that EZH2 may restrain cardiac conversion through H3K27me3-mediated gene repression. Indeed, genomic profiling of H3K27me3 revealed a subset of cardiac genes that remain repressed with high levels of H3K27me3 despite of the delivery of the reprogramming factors. Inhibition of EZH2, however, leads to reduced H3K27me3 occupancy and robust activation of these cardiac genes. Taken together, our data suggested that EZH2 inhibition facilitates the activation of cardiac genes in fibroblasts and eases the production of hiCMs.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with evidence of antibody escape highlight the importance of addressing whether the total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recognition is also affected. Here, we compare SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C lineages in COVID-19 convalescents and in recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. The total reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is similar in terms of magnitude and frequency of response, with decreases in the 10%–22% range observed in some assay/VOC combinations. A total of 7% and 3% of previously identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, respectively, are affected by mutations in the various VOCs. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 variants analyzed here do not significantly disrupt the total SARS-CoV-2 T cell reactivity; however, the decreases observed highlight the importance for active monitoring of T cell reactivity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.
