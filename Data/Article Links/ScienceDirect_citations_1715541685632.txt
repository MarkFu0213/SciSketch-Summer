Abstract: Summary
Secreted Hedgehog (HH) ligands signal through the canonical receptor Patched (PTCH1). However, recent studies implicate three additional HH-binding, cell-surface proteins, GAS1, CDO, and BOC, as putative coreceptors for HH ligands. A central question is to what degree these coreceptors function similarly and what their collective requirement in HH signal transduction is. Here we provide evidence that GAS1, CDO, and BOC play overlapping and essential roles during HH-mediated ventral neural patterning of the mammalian neural tube. Specifically, we demonstrate two important roles for these molecules: an early role in cell fate specification of multiple neural progenitors and a later role in motor neuron progenitor maintenance. Most strikingly, genetic loss-of-function experiments indicate an obligatory requirement for GAS1, CDO, and BOC in HH pathway activity in multiple tissues.

Abstract: To examine the changes of biological activities in hepatic oval cells (HOCs) elicited by 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) and understand the relationship between this cell and liver regeneration (LR), this study isolated and obtained the high purity HOCs (≥95%) from rat regenerating livers, and then monitored gene expression profiling of rat hepatic oval cells following surgical operation. Results showed that there were LR-related 1059 genes. These genes were grossly classified into three groups using a fold change cut-off threshold of three-fold: up-regulation, down-regulation and up/down regulation. Analyses of gene expression patterns combined with gene functional categorization suggested that genes in the categories “nucleic acid metabolism” and “cell cycle” were dominated by up-regulated expression. Genes in the functional groups “cell metabolism” and “oxidation reduction” were significantly enriched in expression pattern characterized by down-regulation. According to above mentioned results, the synchronized induction of DNA replication and cell proliferation-involved genes suggested that the peak of oval cell proliferation might occur between 30 and 36h post-PH. The amino acid transformation-involved genes were down-regulated at the early phase of LR, which perhaps trigger the storage of those amino acids essential for protein synthesis. Reduced oxidative-reduction activity at early phase might be related to negative influence of surgical operation on its detoxification capacity. Conclusively, the genome-wide transcriptional analysis of oval cells would contribute to our understanding of the nature of LR at cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Rosiglitazone is a PPARγ agonist commonly used to treat diabetes. In addition to improving insulin sensitivity, rosiglitazone restores normal vascular function by a mechanism that remains poorly understood. Here we show that adiponectin is required to mediate the PPARγ effect on vascular endothelium of diabetic mice. In db/db and diet-induced obese mice, PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone restores endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortae, whereas diabetic mice lacking adiponectin or treated with an anti-adiponectin antibody do not respond. Rosiglitazone stimulates adiponectin release from fat explants, and subcutaneous fat transplantation from rosiglitazone-treated mice recapitulates vasodilatation in untreated db/db recipients. Mechanistically, adiponectin activates AMPK/eNOS and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in aortae, which increase NO bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that adipocyte-derived adiponectin is required for PPARγ-mediated improvement of endothelial function in diabetes. Thus, the adipose tissue represents a promising target for treating diabetic vasculopathy.

ADF/Cofilin Regulates Secretory Cargo Sorting at the TGN via the Ca2+ ATPase SPCA1,

Abstract: Summary
Actin-severing proteins ADF/cofilin are required for the sorting of secretory cargo at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in mammalian cells. How do these cytoplasmic proteins interact with the cargoes in the lumen of the TGN? Put simply, how are these two sets of proteins connected across the TGN membrane? Mass spectrometry of cofilin1 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells revealed the presence of actin and the Ca2+ ATPase SPCA1. Moreover, cofilin1 was localized to the TGN and bound to SPCA1 via dynamic actin. SPCA1 knockdown, like ADF/cofilin1 knockdown, inhibited Ca2+ uptake into the TGN and caused missorting of secretory cargo. These defects were rescued by the overexpression of the TGN-localized SPCA1. We propose that ADF/cofilin-dependent severing of actin filaments exposes and promotes the activation of SPCA1, which pumps Ca2+ into the lumen of the TGN for the sorting of the class of secretory cargo that binds Ca2+.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), which uses the substrate adaptors CDC20 and CDH1 to target proteins for proteasomal degradation. The APCCDH1 substrate cyclin A is critical for the G1/S transition and, paradoxically, accumulates even when APCCDH1 is active. We show that the deubiquitinase USP37 binds CDH1 and removes degradative polyubiquitin from cyclin A. USP37 was induced by E2F transcription factors in G1, peaked at G1/S, and was degraded in late mitosis. Phosphorylation of USP37 by CDK2 stimulated its full activity. USP37 overexpression caused premature cyclin A accumulation in G1 and accelerated S phase entry, whereas USP37 knockdown delayed these events. USP37 was inactive in mitosis because it was no longer phosphorylated by CDK2. Indeed, it switched from an antagonist to a substrate of APCCDH1 and was modified with degradative K11-linked polyubiquitin.

Abstract: Summary
In animal cells, formation of the cytokinetic furrow requires activation of the GTPase RhoA by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ect2. How Ect2, which is associated with the spindle midzone, controls RhoA activity at the equatorial cortex during anaphase is not understood. Here, we show that Ect2 concentrates at the equatorial membrane during cytokinesis in live cells. Ect2 membrane association requires a pleckstrin homology domain and a polybasic cluster that bind to phosphoinositide lipids. Both guanine nucleotide exchange function and membrane targeting of Ect2 are essential for RhoA activation and cleavage furrow formation in human cells. Membrane localization of Ect2 is spatially confined to the equator by centralspindlin, Ect2's spindle midzone anchor complex, and is temporally coordinated with chromosome segregation through the activation state of CDK1. We propose that targeting of Ect2 to the equatorial membrane represents a key step in the delivery of the cytokinetic signal to the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (AGO) proteins are critical components of RNA silencing pathways that bind small RNAs and mediate gene silencing at their target sites. We found that Arabidopsis AGO2 is highly induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). Further genetic analysis demonstrated that AGO2 functions in antibacterial immunity. One abundant species of AGO2-bound small RNA is miR393b∗, which targets a Golgi-localized SNARE gene, MEMB12. Pst infection downregulates MEMB12 in a miR393b∗-dependent manner. Loss of function of MEMB12, but not SYP61, another intracellular SNARE, leads to increased exocytosis of an antimicrobial pathogenesis-related protein, PR1. Overexpression of miR393b∗ resembles memb12 mutant in resistance responses. Thus, AGO2 functions in antibacterial immunity by binding miR393b∗ to modulate exocytosis of antimicrobial PR proteins via MEMB12. Since miR393 also contributes to antibacterial responses, miR393∗/miR393 represent an example of a miRNA∗/miRNA pair that functions in immunity through two distinct AGOs: miR393∗ through AGO2 and miR393 through AGO1.

Abstract: Summary
Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is a γ-herpesvirus that expresses Sm class U RNAs (HSURs) in latently infected marmoset T cells. By deep sequencing, we identified six HVS microRNAs (miRNAs) that are derived from three hairpin structures located immediately downstream of the 3′ end processing signals of three of the HSURs. The viral miRNAs associate with Ago proteins and are biologically active. We confirmed that the expression of the two classes of viral noncoding RNAs is linked by identifying chimeric HSUR-pre-miRNA transcripts. We show that HVS miRNA biogenesis relies on cis-acting elements specifically required for synthesis and processing of Sm class RNAs. Knockdown of protein components in vivo and processing assays in vitro demonstrated that HVS does not utilize the Microprocessor complex that generates most host miRNAs. Instead, the Integrator complex cleaves to generate the 3′ end of the HSUR and the pre-miRNA hairpin. Exportin-5 and Dicer are then required to generate mature viral miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
We investigated the potential of in-depth quantitative proteomics to reveal plasma protein signatures that reflect lung tumor biology. We compared plasma protein profiles of four mouse models of lung cancer with profiles of models of pancreatic, ovarian, colon, prostate, and breast cancer and two models of inflammation. A protein signature for Titf1/Nkx2-1, a known lineage-survival oncogene in lung cancer, was found in plasmas of mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. An EGFR signature was found in plasma of an EGFR mutant model, and a distinct plasma signature related to neuroendocrine development was uncovered in the small-cell lung cancer model. We demonstrate relevance to human lung cancer of the protein signatures identified on the basis of mouse models.

Abstract: Summary
Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in control of energy balance, but the physiological importance of NPY in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) remains unclear. Here we report that knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH by adeno-associated virus-mediated RNAi reduced fat depots in rats fed regular chow and ameliorated high-fat diet-induced hyperphagia and obesity. DMH NPY knockdown resulted in development of brown adipocytes in inguinal white adipose tissue through the sympathetic nervous system. This knockdown increased uncoupling protein 1 expression in both inguinal fat and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT). Consistent with the activation of BAT, DMH NPY knockdown increased energy expenditure and enhanced the thermogenic response to a cold environment. This knockdown also increased locomotor activity, improved glucose homeostasis, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Together, these results demonstrate critical roles of DMH NPY in body weight regulation through affecting food intake, body adiposity, thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and physical activity.

Abstract: Parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor (PPR) signaling is known to be involved in tooth development. In bone, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin (OPN) is a negative regulator of PPR signaling in bone formation. However, the role of OPN in modulation of PPR action in tooth development is not understood. Therefore, we examined the tooth in double mutant mice. Constitutively active PPR was expressed specifically in the odontoblasts and osteoblasts (caPPR-tg) in the presence or absence of OPN. Radiographic analysis indicated that the length of the third molar (M3) and the incisor was decreased in the caPPR-tg mice compared to wild type, and such reduction in molar and incisor length was further enhanced in the absence of OPN (caPPR-tg OPN-KO). With respect to histology of incisors, caPPR-tg induced high cellularity and irregularity in odontoblastic shape and this was enhanced by the absence of OPN. These morphological observations suggest that OPN modulates PPR signaling that are involved in tooth formation.

Abstract: Summary
We present a molecular dissection of pause site-dependent transcriptional termination for mammalian RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-transcribed genes. We show that nascent transcripts form RNA/DNA hybrid structures (R-loops) behind elongating Pol II and are especially prevalent over G-rich pause sites positioned downstream of gene poly(A) signals. Senataxin, a helicase protein associated with AOA2/ALS4 neurodegenerative disorders, acts to resolve these R-loop structures and by so doing allows access of the 5′–3′ exonuclease Xrn2 at 3′ cleavage poly(A) sites. This affords 3′ transcript degradation and consequent Pol II termination. In effect, R-loops formed over G-rich pause sites, followed by their resolution by senataxin, are key steps in the termination process.

Abstract: Summary
Imbalances in glucose and energy homeostasis are at the core of the worldwide epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Here, we illustrate an important role of the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway in regulating glucose and energy homeostasis. Smad3-deficient mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Interestingly, the metabolic protection is accompanied by Smad3−/− white adipose tissue acquiring the bioenergetic and gene expression profile of brown fat/skeletal muscle. Smad3−/− adipocytes demonstrate a marked increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, with a corresponding increase in basal respiration, and Smad3 acts as a repressor of PGC-1α expression. We observe significant correlation between TGF-β1 levels and adiposity in rodents and humans. Further, systemic blockade of TGF-β signaling protects mice from obesity, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. Together, these results demonstrate that TGF-β signaling regulates glucose tolerance and energy homeostasis and suggest that modulation of TGF-β activity might be an effective treatment strategy for obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Androgen receptor (AR) is reactivated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through mechanisms including marked increases in AR gene expression. We identify an enhancer in the AR second intron contributing to increased AR expression at low androgen levels in CRPC. Moreover, at increased androgen levels, the AR binds this site and represses AR gene expression through recruitment of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and H3K4me1,2 demethylation. AR similarly represses expression of multiple genes mediating androgen synthesis, DNA synthesis, and proliferation while stimulating genes mediating lipid and protein biosynthesis. Androgen levels in CRPC appear adequate to stimulate AR activity on enhancer elements, but not suppressor elements, resulting in increased expression of AR and AR repressed genes that contribute to cellular proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The human ribonuclease Dicer and its double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein (dsRBP) partners TRBP and PACT play important roles in the biogenesis of regulatory RNAs. Following dicing, one dsRNA product strand is preferentially assembled into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The mechanism of strand selection in humans and the possible role of Dicer in this process remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that dsRNAs undergo significant repositioning within Dicer complexes following dicing. This repositioning enables directional binding of RNA duplexes, thereby biasing their orientation for guide strand selection according to the thermodynamic properties of the helix. Our findings indicate that Dicer is itself capable of sensing siRNA thermodynamic asymmetry regardless of the dsRBP to which it is bound. These results support a model in which Dicer employs two distinct RNA-binding sites—one for dsRNA processing and the other for sensing of siRNA thermodynamic asymmetry—during RISC loading in humans.

Abstract: Summary
A newly emerged oncogenic cell in the epithelial population has to confront antitumor selective pressures in the host tissue. However, the mechanisms by which surrounding normal tissue exerts antitumor effects against oncogenically transformed cells are poorly understood. In Drosophila imaginal epithelia, clones of cells mutant for evolutionarily conserved tumor suppressor genes such as scrib or dlg lose their epithelial integrity and are eliminated from epithelia when surrounded by wild-type tissue. Here, we show that surrounding normal cells activate nonapoptotic JNK signaling in response to the emergence of oncogenic mutant cells. This JNK activation leads to upregulation of PVR, the Drosophila PDGF/VEGF receptor. Genetic and time-lapse imaging analyses reveal that PVR expression in surrounding cells activates the ELMO/Mbc-mediated phagocytic pathway, thereby eliminating oncogenic neighbors by engulfment. Our data indicate that JNK-mediated cell engulfment could be an evolutionarily conserved intrinsic tumor-suppression mechanism that eliminates premalignant cells from epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Quorum-sensing bacteria communicate via small molecules called autoinducers to coordinate collective behaviors. Because quorum sensing controls virulence factor expression in many clinically relevant pathogens, membrane-permeable quorum sensing antagonists that prevent population-wide expression of virulence genes offer a potential route to novel antibacterial therapeutics. Here, we report a strategy for inhibiting quorum-sensing receptors of the widespread LuxR family. Structure-function studies with natural and synthetic ligands demonstrate that the dimeric LuxR-type transcription factor CviR from Chromobacterium violaceum is potently antagonized by molecules that bind in place of the native acylated homoserine lactone autoinducer, provided that they stabilize a closed conformation. In such conformations, each of the two DNA-binding domains interacts with the ligand-binding domain of the opposing monomer. Consequently, the DNA-binding helices are held apart by ∼60 Å, twice the ∼30 Å separation required for operator binding. This approach may represent a general strategy for the inhibition of multidomain proteins.

Abstract: Summary
All Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are released from producing cells despite being synthesized as N- and C-terminally lipidated, membrane-tethered molecules. Thus, a cellular mechanism is needed for Hh solubilization. We previously suggested that a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-mediated shedding of Sonic hedgehog (ShhNp) from its lipidated N and C termini results in protein solubilization. This finding, however, seemed at odds with the established role of N-terminal palmitoylation for ShhNp signaling activity. We now resolve this paradox by showing that N-palmitoylation of ShhNp N-terminal peptides is required for their proteolytic removal during solubilization. These peptides otherwise block ShhNp zinc coordination sites required for ShhNp binding to its receptor Patched (Ptc), explaining the essential yet indirect role of N-palmitoylation for ShhNp function. We suggest a functional model in which membrane-tethered multimeric ShhNp is at least partially autoinhibited in trans but is processed into fully active, soluble multimers upon palmitoylation-dependent cleavage of inhibitory N-terminal peptides.

Abstract: Respiratory tract exposure to viruses, air pollutants, or bacterial pathogens can lead to pulmonary diseases. The molecular mechanism of mucous overproduction increased by these pathogens provides the knowledge for developing new therapeutic strategies. There is established in vitro data demonstrating that the overexpression of MUC5AC is induced by peptidoglycan (PGN) derived from Staphylococcus aureus. However, the mechanisms by which PGN activates MUC5AC gene expression in the airway remain unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism of PGN-induced MUC5AC gene expression. We found that PGN could induce MUC5AC gene expressions in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activations of ERK1/2 and JNK increased after treatment of cells with PGN, whereas phosporylation of p38 was undetected. Of these MAPKs, pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 decreased PGN-induced MUC5AC gene expression. In addition, we checked the activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) as a downstream signaling target of ERK1/2 in PGN signaling. The activation of RSK1 was prevented by pretreatment with PD98059. We also found that RSK1 mediated the PGN-induced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the transcription of MUC5AC. Furthermore, the cAMPresponse element (CRE) in the MUC5AC promoter appears to be important for PGN-induced MUC5AC gene expression in NCI-H292 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The white-collar complex (WCC), the core transcription factor of the circadian clock of Neurospora, activates morning-specific expression of the transcription repressor CSP1. Newly synthesized CSP1 exists in a transient complex with the corepressor RCM1/RCO1 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR1. CSP1 is rapidly hyperphosphorylated and degraded via UBR1 and its ubiquitin conjugase RAD6. Genes controlled by CSP1 are rhythmically expressed and peak in the evening (i.e., in antiphase to morning-specific genes directly controlled by WCC). Rhythmic expression of these second-tier genes depends crucially on phosphorylation and rapid turnover of CSP1, which ensures tight coupling of CSP1 abundance and function to the circadian activity of WCC. Negative feedback of CSP1 on its own transcription buffers the amplitude of CSP1-dependent oscillations against fluctuations of WCC activity. CSP1 predominantly regulates genes involved in metabolism. It controls ergosterol synthesis and fatty acid desaturases and thereby modulates the lipid composition of membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related loss of muscle mass and force (sarcopenia) contributes to disability and increased mortality. Ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel required for muscle contraction. RyR1 from aged (24 months) rodents was oxidized, cysteine-nitrosylated, and depleted of the channel-stabilizing subunit calstabin1, compared to RyR1 from younger (3–6 months) adults. This RyR1 channel complex remodeling resulted in “leaky” channels with increased open probability, leading to intracellular calcium leak in skeletal muscle. Similarly, 6-month-old mice harboring leaky RyR1-S2844D mutant channels exhibited skeletal muscle defects comparable to 24-month-old wild-type mice. Treating aged mice with S107 stabilized binding of calstabin1 to RyR1, reduced intracellular calcium leak, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced tetanic Ca2+ release, muscle-specific force, and exercise capacity. Taken together, these data indicate that leaky RyR1 contributes to age-related loss of muscle function.

Abstract: Summary
PTPMT1 was the first protein tyrosine phosphatase found localized to the mitochondria, but its biological function was unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that whole body deletion of Ptpmt1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, suggesting an indispensable role for PTPMT1 during development. Ptpmt1 deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts compromises mitochondrial respiration and results in abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Lipid analysis of Ptpmt1-deficient fibroblasts reveals an accumulation of phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) along with a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylglycerol. PGP is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid regulating the membrane integrity and activities of the organelle. We further demonstrate that PTPMT1 specifically dephosphorylates PGP in vitro. Loss of PTPMT1 leads to dramatic diminution of cardiolipin, which can be partially reversed by the expression of catalytic active PTPMT1. Our study identifies PTPMT1 as the mammalian PGP phosphatase and points to its role as a regulator of cardiolipin biosynthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cdk specificity is determined by the intrinsic selectivity of the active site and by substrate docking sites on the cyclin subunit. There is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of these factors in the timing of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We analyzed major budding yeast cyclins (the G1/S-cyclin Cln2, S-cyclin Clb5, G2/M-cyclin Clb3, and M-cyclin Clb2) and found that the activity of Cdk1 toward the consensus motif increased gradually in the sequence Cln2-Clb5-Clb3-Clb2, in parallel with cell cycle progression. Further, we identified a docking element that compensates for the weak intrinsic specificity of Cln2 toward G1-specific targets. In addition, Cln2-Cdk1 showed distinct consensus site specificity, suggesting that cyclins do not merely activate Cdk1 but also modulate its active-site specificity. Finally, we identified several Cln2-, Clb3-, and Clb2-specific Cdk1 targets. We propose that robust timing and ordering of cell cycle events depend on gradual changes in the substrate specificity of Cdk1.

Abstract: Summary
The coordination of the several pathways involved in cell motility is poorly understood. Here, we identify SH3BP1, belonging to the RhoGAP family, as a partner of the exocyst complex and establish a physical and functional link between two motility-driving pathways, the Ral/exocyst and Rac signaling pathways. We show that SH3BP1 localizes together with the exocyst to the leading edge of motile cells and that SH3BP1 regulates cell migration via its GAP activity upon Rac1. SH3BP1 loss of function induces abnormally high Rac1 activity at the front, as visualized by in vivo biosensors, and disorganized and instable protrusions, as revealed by cell morphodynamics analysis. Consistently, constitutively active Rac1 mimics the phenotype of SH3BP1 depletion: slow migration and aberrant cell morphodynamics. Our finding that SH3BP1 downregulates Rac1 at the motile-cell front indicates that Rac1 inactivation in this location, as well as its activation by GEF proteins, is a fundamental requirement for cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and progression are linked tightly to progressive hepatic metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and chronic inflammation. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a major transactivator of stress proteins, increases survival by protecting cells against environmental stressors. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, but specific mechanisms by which HSF1 supports cancer development remain elusive. We propose a pathogenic mechanism whereby HSF1 activation promotes growth of premalignant cells and HCC development by stimulating lipid biosynthesis and perpetuating chronic hepatic metabolic disease induced by carcinogens. Our work shows that inactivation of HSF1 impairs cancer progression, mitigating adverse effects of carcinogens on hepatic metabolism by enhancing insulin sensitivity and sensitizing activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an important regulator of energy homeostasis and inhibitor of lipid synthesis. HSF1 is a potential target for the control of hepatic steatosis, hepatic insulin resistance, and HCC development.

Abstract: Summary
The miR-16 family, which targets genes important for the G1-S transition, is a known modulator of the cell cycle, and members of this family are often deleted or downregulated in many types of cancers. Here, we report the reciprocal relationship—that of the cell cycle controlling the miR-16 family. Levels of this family increase rapidly as cells are arrested in G0. Conversely, as cells are released from G0 arrest, levels of the miR-16 family rapidly decrease. Such rapid changes are made possible by the unusual instabilities of several family members. The repression mediated by the miR-16 family is sensitive to these cell-cycle changes, which suggests that the rapid upregulation of the miR-16 family reinforces cell-cycle arrest in G0. Upon cell-cycle re-entry, the rapid decay of several members allows levels of the family to decrease, alleviating repression of target genes and allowing proper resumption of the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of p53 by DNA damage results in either cell-cycle arrest, allowing DNA repair and cell survival, or induction of apoptosis. As these opposite outcomes are both mediated by p53 stabilization, additional mechanisms to determine this decision must exist. Here, we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is required for the p53-mediated induction of the proapoptotic BH3 only-protein PUMA, an essential mediator of p53-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of GSK-3 protected from cell death induced by DNA damage and promoted increased long-term cell survival. We demonstrate that GSK-3 phosphorylates serine 86 of the p53-acetyltransferase Tip60. A Tip60S86A mutant was less active to induce p53 K120 acetylation, histone 4 acetylation, and expression of PUMA. Our data suggest that GSK-3 mediated Tip60S86 phosphorylation provides a link between PI3K signaling and the choice for or against apoptosis induction by p53.

Import Oligomers Induce Positive Feedback to Promote Peroxisome Differentiation and Control Organelle Abundance,

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in cell biology is how cells control organelle composition and abundance. Woronin bodies are fungal peroxisomes centered on a crystalline core of the self-assembled HEX protein. Despite using the canonical peroxisome import machinery for biogenesis, Woronin bodies are scarce compared to the overall peroxisome population. Here, we show that HEX oligomers promote the differentiation of a subpopulation of peroxisomes, which become enlarged and highly active in matrix protein import. HEX physically associates with the essential matrix import peroxin, PEX26, and promotes its enrichment in the membrane of differentiated peroxisomes. In addition, a PEX26 mutant that disrupts differentiation produces increased numbers of aberrantly small Woronin bodies. Our data suggest a mechanism where HEX oligomers recruit a key component of the import machinery, which promotes the import of additional HEX. This type of positive feedback provides a basic mechanism for the production of an organelle subpopulation of distinct composition and abundance.

Abstract: Summary
Directed membrane trafficking is believed to be crucial for axon development during neuronal morphogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report a role of Lgl1, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila tumor suppressor Lethal giant larvae, in controlling membrane trafficking underlying axonal growth. We find that Lgl1 is associated with plasmalemmal precursor vesicles and enriched in developing axons. Lgl1 upregulation promoted axonal growth, whereas downregulation attenuated it as well as directional membrane insertion. Interestingly, Lgl1 interacted with and activated Rab10, a small GTPase that mediates membrane protein trafficking, by releasing GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) from Rab10. Furthermore, Rab10 lies downstream of Lgl1 in axon development and directional membrane insertion. Finally, both Lgl1 and Rab10 are required for neocortical neuronal polarization in vivo. Thus, the Lgl1 regulation of Rab10 stimulates the trafficking of membrane precursor vesicles, whose fusion with the plasmalemma is crucial for axonal growth.

Abstract: Summary
We have determined the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the Caulobacter crescentus genome by combining genome-wide chromatin interaction detection, live-cell imaging, and computational modeling. Using chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), we derive ∼13 kb resolution 3D models of the Caulobacter genome. The resulting models illustrate that the genome is ellipsoidal with periodically arranged arms. The parS sites, a pair of short contiguous sequence elements known to be involved in chromosome segregation, are positioned at one pole, where they anchor the chromosome to the cell and contribute to the formation of a compact chromatin conformation. Repositioning these elements resulted in rotations of the chromosome that changed the subcellular positions of most genes. Such rotations did not lead to large-scale changes in gene expression, indicating that genome folding does not strongly affect gene regulation. Collectively, our data suggest that genome folding is globally dictated by the parS sites and chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
The microbiome is being characterized by large-scale sequencing efforts, yet it is not known whether it regulates host metabolism in a general versus tissue-specific manner or which bacterial metabolites are important. Here, we demonstrate that microbiota have a strong effect on energy homeostasis in the colon compared to other tissues. This tissue specificity is due to colonocytes utilizing bacterially produced butyrate as their primary energy source. Colonocytes from germfree mice are in an energy-deprived state and exhibit decreased expression of enzymes that catalyze key steps in intermediary metabolism including the TCA cycle. Consequently, there is a marked decrease in NADH/NAD+, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP levels, which results in AMPK activation, p27kip1 phosphorylation, and autophagy. When butyrate is added to germfree colonocytes, it rescues their deficit in mitochondrial respiration and prevents them from undergoing autophagy. The mechanism is due to butyrate acting as an energy source rather than as an HDAC inhibitor.

Abstract: Summary
The autonomic nervous system regulates hormone secretion from the endocrine pancreas, the islets of Langerhans, thus impacting glucose metabolism. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves innervate the pancreatic islet, but the precise innervation patterns are unknown, particularly in human. Here we demonstrate that the innervation of human islets is different from that of mouse islets and does not conform to existing models of autonomic control of islet function. By visualizing axons in three dimensions and quantifying axonal densities and contacts within pancreatic islets, we found that, unlike mouse endocrine cells, human endocrine cells are sparsely contacted by autonomic axons. Few parasympathetic cholinergic axons penetrate the human islet, and the invading sympathetic fibers preferentially innervate smooth muscle cells of blood vessels located within the islet. Thus, rather than modulating endocrine cell function directly, sympathetic nerves may regulate hormone secretion in human islets by controlling local blood flow or by acting on islet regions located downstream.

Abstract: Summary
Hedgehog (Hh) proteins regulate important developmental processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. Although Patched acts as the main Hh receptor in Drosophila, Hh signaling absolutely requires the additional Hh-binding proteins Ihog and Boi. Here we show that, unexpectedly, cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) lacking Boc and Cdon, the vertebrate orthologs of Ihog and Boi, still proliferate in response to Hh. This is because in their absence, Gas1, an Hh-binding protein not present in Drosophila, mediates Hh signaling. Consistently, only CGNPs lacking all three molecules—Boc, Cdon, and Gas1—have a complete loss of Hh-dependent proliferation. In a complementary manner, we find that a mutated Hh ligand that binds Patched1 but not Boc, Cdon, or Gas1 cannot activate Hh signaling. Together, this demonstrates an absolute requirement for Boc, Cdon, and Gas1 in Hh signaling and reveals a distinct requirement for ligand-binding components that distinguishes the vertebrate and invertebrate Hh receptor systems.

Abstract: Summary
Tail-anchored (TA) proteins access the secretory pathway via posttranslational insertion of their C-terminal transmembrane domain into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Get3 is an ATPase that delivers TA proteins to the ER by interacting with the Get1-Get2 transmembrane complex, but how Get3's nucleotide cycle drives TA protein insertion remains unclear. Here, we establish that nucleotide binding to Get3 promotes Get3-TA protein complex formation by recruiting Get3 to a chaperone that hands over TA proteins to Get3. Biochemical reconstitution and mutagenesis reveal that the Get1-Get2 complex comprises the minimal TA protein insertion machinery with functionally critical cytosolic regions. By engineering a soluble heterodimer of Get1-Get2 cytosolic domains, we uncover the mechanism of TA protein release from Get3: Get2 tethers Get3-TA protein complexes into proximity with the ATPase-dependent, substrate-releasing activity of Get1. Lastly, we show that ATP enhances Get3 dissociation from the membrane, thus freeing Get1-Get2 for new rounds of substrate insertion.

Abstract: Summary
Although the structural core of the ribosome is conserved in all kingdoms of life, eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger and more complex than their bacterial counterparts. The extent to which these differences influence the molecular mechanism of translation remains elusive. Multiparticle cryo-electron microscopy and single-molecule FRET investigations of the mammalian pretranslocation complex reveal spontaneous, large-scale conformational changes, including an intersubunit rotation of the ribosomal subunits. Through structurally related processes, tRNA substrates oscillate between classical and at least two distinct hybrid configurations facilitated by localized changes in their L-shaped fold. Hybrid states are favored within the mammalian complex. However, classical tRNA positions can be restored by tRNA binding to the E site or by the eukaryotic-specific antibiotic and translocation inhibitor cycloheximide. These findings reveal critical distinctions in the structural and energetic features of bacterial and mammalian ribosomes, providing a mechanistic basis for divergent translation regulation strategies and species-specific antibiotic action.

Abstract: Summary
Protein toxins such as Ricin and Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) pose major public health challenges. Both toxins depend on host cell machinery for internalization, retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the ER, and translocation to cytosol. Although both toxins follow a similar intracellular route, it is unknown how much they rely on the same genes. Here we conducted two genome-wide RNAi screens identifying genes required for intoxication and demonstrating that requirements are strikingly different between PE and Ricin, with only 13% overlap. Yet factors required by both toxins are present from the endosomes to the ER, and, at the morphological level, the toxins colocalize in multiple structures. Interestingly, Ricin, but not PE, depends on Golgi complex integrity and colocalizes significantly with a medial Golgi marker. Our data are consistent with two intertwined pathways converging and diverging at multiple points and reveal the complexity of retrograde membrane trafficking in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle checkpoint is the prime cell-cycle control mechanism that ensures sister chromatids are bioriented before anaphase takes place. Aurora B kinase, the catalytic subunit of the chromosome passenger complex, both destabilizes kinetochore attachments that do not generate tension and simultaneously maintains the spindle checkpoint signal. However, it is unclear how the checkpoint is silenced following chromosome biorientation. We demonstrate that association of type 1 phosphatase (PP1Dis2) with both the N terminus of Spc7 and the nonmotor domains of the Klp5-Klp6 (kinesin-8) complex is necessary to counteract Aurora B kinase to efficiently silence the spindle checkpoint. The role of Klp5 and Klp6 in checkpoint silencing is specific to this class of kinesin and independent of their motor activities. These data demonstrate that at least two distinct pools of PP1, one kinetochore associated and the other motor associated, are needed to silence the spindle checkpoint.

Abstract: Summary
TP53 missense mutations dramatically influence tumor progression, however, their mechanism of action is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the fundamental role of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in mutant p53 oncogenic functions. Pin1 enhances tumorigenesis in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model and cooperates with mutant p53 in Ras-dependent transformation. In breast cancer cells, Pin1 promotes mutant p53 dependent inhibition of the antimetastatic factor p63 and induction of a mutant p53 transcriptional program to increase aggressiveness. Furthermore, we identified a transcriptional signature associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and, in a cohort of patients, Pin1 overexpression influenced the prognostic value of p53 mutation. These results define a Pin1/mutant p53 axis that conveys oncogenic signals to promote aggressiveness in human cancers.

The brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway includes two receptor-like kinases (BRI1 and BAK1), a plasma membrane-associated kinase (BSK1), two phosphatases (BSU1 and PP2A), a GSK3-like kinase (BIN2), and two homologous transcription factors (BZR1 and BES1/BZR2). But the mechanisms of signal relay are not fully understood. Here, we show that a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase named CDG1 mediates signal transduction from BRI1 to BSU1. Transgenic experiments confirm that CDG1 and its homolog CDL1 positively regulate BR signaling and plant growth. Mass spectrometry analysis identified BRI1 phosphorylation sites in CDG1 and CDG1 phosphorylation sites in BSU1. Mutations of these phosphorylation sites compromised the BR signaling functions. The results demonstrate that BRI1 phosphorylates S234 to activate CDG1 kinase, and CDG1 in turn phosphorylates S764 to activate BSU1, which inactivates BIN2 by dephosphorylating Y200 of BIN2. This study thus demonstrates a complete phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade linking a steroid-activated receptor kinase to a GSK3-like kinase in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulation of SHP2 is associated with malignant diseases as well as developmental disorders. Although SHP2 is required for full activation of RAS signaling, other potential roles in cell physiology have not been elucidated. Here we show that SHP2 dephosphorylates parafibromin/Cdc73, a core component of the RNA polymerase II-associated factor (PAF) complex. Parafibromin is known to act as a tumor suppressor that inhibits cyclin D1 and c-myc by recruiting SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, parafibromin can also act in the opposing direction by binding β-catenin, thereby activating promitogenic/oncogenic Wnt signaling. We found that, on tyrosine dephosphorylation by SHP2, parafibromin acquires the ability to stably bind β-catenin. The parafibromin/β-catenin interaction overrides parafibromin/SUV39H1-mediated transrepression and induces expression of Wnt target genes, including cyclin D1 and c-myc. Hence, SHP2 governs the opposing functions of parafibromin, deregulation of which may cause the development of tumors or developmental malformations.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used with success in several clinical applications for clinical treatment of ischemic hearts. However, the reported effects of MSC-based therapy on myocardial infarction (MI) are inconsistent. In particular, the preventive effects of MSC-based therapy on arrhythmic sudden death and metabolic disorders after infarction remain controversial. Here, we investigated the effects of MSCs on reverse remodeling in an infarcted myocardium, and found that MSC-therapy failed to achieve the complete regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Histological analyses showed that although infarct size and interstitial fibrosis induced by MI recovered significantly after MSC treatment, these improvements were marginal, indicating that a significant amount of damaged tissue was still present. Furthermore, transplanted MSCs had slight anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects in MSC-implanted regions and no significant improvements in cardiac function were observed, suggesting that naïve MSCs might not be the right cell type to treat myocardial infarction. Furthermore, small ion profiling using ToF-SIMS revealed that the metabolic stabilization provided by the MSCs implantation was not significant compared to the sham group. Together, these results indicate that pretreatment of MSCs is needed to enhance the benefits of MSCs, particularly when MSCs are used to treat arrhythmogenicity and metabolically stabilize infarcted myocardium.

Abstract: Summary
Protein acetylation has emerged as a major mechanism in regulating cellular metabolism. Whereas most glycolytic steps are reversible, the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase is irreversible, and the reverse reaction requires phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK1) to commit for gluconeogenesis. Here, we show that acetylation regulates the stability of the gluconeogenic rate-limiting enzyme PEPCK1, thereby modulating cellular response to glucose. High glucose destabilizes PEPCK1 by stimulating its acetylation. PEPCK1 is acetylated by the P300 acetyltransferase, and this acetylation stimulates the interaction between PEPCK1 and UBR5, a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, therefore promoting PEPCK1 ubiquitinylation and degradation. Conversely, SIRT2 deacetylates and stabilizes PEPCK1. These observations represent an example that acetylation targets a metabolic enzyme to a specific E3 ligase in response to metabolic condition changes. Given that increased levels of PEPCK are linked with type II diabetes, this study also identifies potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The protein kinase Bβ (Akt2) pathway is known to mediate insulin-stimulated glucose transport through increasing glucose transporter GLUT4 translocation from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane (PM). Combining quantitative phosphoproteomics with RNAi-based functional analyses, we show that a previously uncharacterized 138 kDa C2 domain-containing phosphoprotein (CDP138) is a substrate for Akt2, and is required for optimal insulin-stimulated glucose transport, GLUT4 translocation, and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the PM in live adipocytes. The purified C2 domain is capable of binding Ca2+ and lipid membranes. CDP138 mutants lacking the Ca2+-binding sites in the C2 domain or Akt2 phosphorylation site S197 inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 insertion into the PM, a rate-limiting step of GLUT4 translocation. Interestingly, CDP138 is dynamically associated with the PM and GLUT4-containing vesicles in response to insulin stimulation. Together, these results suggest that CDP138 is a key molecule linking the Akt2 pathway to the regulation of GLUT4 vesicle-PM fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired resistance to ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through ABL1 kinase domain mutations, particularly the gatekeeper mutant T315I, is a significant problem for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Using structure-based drug design, we developed compounds that bind to residues (Arg386/Glu282) ABL1 uses to switch between inactive and active conformations. The lead “switch-control” inhibitor, DCC-2036, potently inhibits both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ABL1 by inducing a type II inactive conformation, and retains efficacy against the majority of clinically relevant CML-resistance mutants, including T315I. DCC-2036 inhibits BCR-ABL1T315I-expressing cell lines, prolongs survival in mouse models of T315I mutant CML and B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and inhibits primary patient leukemia cells expressing T315I in vitro and in vivo, supporting its clinical development in TKI-resistant Ph+ leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Arginine methylation is a widespread posttranslational modification of proteins catalyzed by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). It is well established that PRMTs are implicated in various cellular processes, but their physiological roles remain unclear. Using nematodes with a loss-of-function mutation, we show that prmt-1, the major asymmetric arginine methyltransferase, is a positive regulator of longevity in C. elegans. This regulation is dependent on both its enzymatic activity and DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor, which is negatively regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation downstream of the DAF-2/insulin signaling. prmt-1 is also required for stress tolerance and fat storage but not dauer formation in daf-2 mutants. Biochemical analyses indicate that PRMT-1 methylates DAF-16, thereby blocking its phosphorylation by AKT. Disruption of PRMT-1 induces phosphorylation of DAF-16 with a concomitant reduction in the expression of longevity-related genes. Thus, we provide a mechanism by which asymmetric arginine dimethylation acts as an antiaging modification in C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
To metastasize, a tumor cell must acquire abilities such as the capacity to colonize new tissue and evade immune surveillance. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs can promote the evolution of malignant behaviors by regulating multiple targets. We performed a microRNA analysis of human melanoma, a highly invasive cancer, and found that miR-30b/30d upregulation correlates with stage, metastatic potential, shorter time to recurrence, and reduced overall survival. Ectopic expression of miR-30b/30d promoted the metastatic behavior of melanoma cells by directly targeting the GalNAc transferase GALNT7, resulted in increased synthesis of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and reduced immune cell activation and recruitment. These data support a key role of miR-30b/30d and GalNAc transferases in metastasis, by simultaneously promoting cellular invasion and immunosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
Proinflammatory cytokines are frequently observed in the tumor microenvironment, and chronic inflammation is involved in cancer initiation and progression. We show that cytokine signaling through the receptor subunit GP130-IL6ST and the kinase JAK1 generates actomyosin contractility through Rho-kinase dependent signaling. This pathway generates contractile force in stromal fibroblasts to remodel the extracellular matrix to create tracks for collective migration of squamous carcinoma cells and provides the high levels of actomyosin contractility required for migration of individual melanoma cells in the rounded, “amoeboid” mode. Thus, cytokine signaling can generate actomyosin contractility in both stroma and tumor cells. Strikingly, actomyosin contractility itself positively modulates activity of the transcription factor STAT3 downstream of JAK1, demonstrating positive feedback within the signaling network.

A PLCβ/PI3Kγ-GSK3 Signaling Pathway Regulates Cofilin Phosphatase Slingshot2 and Neutrophil Polarization and Chemotaxis,

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils, in response to a chemoattractant gradient, undergo dynamic F-actin remodeling, a process important for their directional migration or chemotaxis. However, signaling mechanisms for chemoattractants to regulate the process are incompletely understood. Here, we characterized chemoattractant-activated signaling mechanisms that regulate cofilin dephosphorylation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization and are critical for neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis. In neutrophils, chemoattractants induced phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3 via both PLCβ-PKC and PI3Kγ-AKT pathways, leading to the attenuation of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of the cofilin phosphatase slingshot2 and an increase in dephosphorylated, active cofilin. The relative contribution of this GSK3-mediated pathway to neutrophil chemotaxis regulation depended on neutrophil polarity preset by integrin-induced polarization of PIP5K1C. Therefore, our study characterizes a signaling mechanism for chemoattractant-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling and elucidates its context-dependent role in regulating neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis.

Granzyme B-Dependent Proteolysis Acts as a Switch to Enhance the Proinflammatory Activity of IL-1α,

Abstract: Summary
Granzyme B is a cytotoxic lymphocyte-derived protease that plays a central role in promoting apoptosis of virus-infected target cells, through direct proteolysis and activation of constituents of the cell death machinery. However, previous studies have also implicated granzymes A and B in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, via a mechanism that remains undefined. Here we show that IL-1α is a substrate for granzyme B and that proteolysis potently enhanced the biological activity of this cytokine in vitro as well as in vivo. Consistent with this, compared with full-length IL-1α, granzyme B-processed IL-1α exhibited more potent activity as an immunoadjuvant in vivo. Furthermore, proteolysis of IL-1α within the same region, by proteases such as calpain and elastase, was also found to enhance its biological potency. Thus, IL-1α processing by multiple immune-related proteases, including granzyme B, acts as a switch to enhance the proinflammatory properties of this cytokine.

Abstract: This report describes the use of Bayesian methods to analyze polyprotein coding region sequences (n = 217) obtained from GenBank to define the genome-wide phylogeny of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The results strongly supported the monophyly of five FMDV serotypes, O, A, Asia 1, C, and SAT 3, while sequences for the two remaining FMDV serotypes, SAT 1 and SAT 2 did not separate into entirely distinct clades. The phylogenomic tree revealed three sister-group relationships, serotype O + Asia 1, A + C, and SAT 1 + 3 + 2, with a new branching pattern: {[(O, Asia 1), (A, C)], (SAT 1, 2, 3)}. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMDVs. Analysis of the polyprotein coding region of these sequences provided evidence for the influence of purifying selection on the evolution of FMDV. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, the evolutionary rate of FMDV isolates that circulated during the years 1932-2007 was estimated to be 1.46 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus existed approximately 481 years ago. Bayesian skyline plot revealed a population expansion in the early 20th century that was followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20th century to the present day. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that impact on the evolution of this important livestock pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular architecture of centromere-specific nucleosomes containing histone variant CenH3 is controversial. We have biochemically reconstituted two distinct populations of nucleosomes containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae CenH3 (Cse4). Reconstitution of octameric nucleosomes containing histones Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B is robust on noncentromere DNA, but inefficient on AT-rich centromere DNA. However, nonhistone Scm3, which is required for Cse4 deposition in vivo, facilitates in vitro reconstitution of Cse4/H4/Scm3 complexes on AT-rich centromere sequences. Scm3 has a nonspecific DNA binding domain that shows preference for AT-rich DNA and a histone chaperone domain that promotes specific loading of Cse4/H4. In live cells, Scm3-GFP is enriched at centromeres in all cell cycle phases. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirms that Scm3 occupies centromere DNA throughout the cell cycle, even when Cse4 and H4 are temporarily dislodged in S phase. These findings suggest a model in which centromere-bound Scm3 aids recruitment of Cse4/H4 to assemble and maintain an H2A/H2B-deficient centromeric nucleosome.

Abstract: Summary
Eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) participates in the super elongation complex (SEC) with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) CTD kinase P-TEFb. SEC is a key regulator in the expression of HOX genes in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-based hematological malignancies, in the control of induced gene expression early in development, and in immediate early gene transcription. Here, we identify an SEC-like complex in Drosophila, as well as a distinct ELL-containing complex that lacks P-TEFb and other components of SEC named the “little elongation complex” (LEC). LEC subunits are highly enriched at RNA Pol II-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, and the loss of LEC results in decreased snRNA expression in both flies and mammals. The specialization of the SEC and LEC complexes for mRNA and snRNA-containing genes, respectively, suggests the presence of specific classes of elongation factors for each class of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II.

Abstract: Summary
Selective macroautophagy (autophagy) of ubiquitinated protein is implicated as a compensatory mechanism of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p62/SQSTM1 is a key molecule managing autophagic clearance of polyubiquitinated proteins. However, little is known about mechanisms controlling autophagic degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Here, we show that the specific phosphorylation of p62 at serine 403 (S403) in its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain increases the affinity between UBA and polyubiquitin chain, resulting in efficiently targeting polyubiquitinated proteins in “sequestosomes” and stabilizing sequestosome structure as a cargo of ubiquitinated proteins for autophagosome entry. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates S403 of p62 directly. Furthermore, CK2 overexpression or phosphatase inhibition reduces the formation of inclusion bodies of the polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin exon1 fragment in a p62-dependent manner. We propose that phosphorylation of p62 at S403 regulates autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated proteins and protein aggregates that are poorly degraded by proteasomes.

Abstract: Expansins are non-hydrolytic cell wall-loosening proteins that are involved in the cell wall modifications that underlie many plant developmental processes. Root hair growth requires the accumulation of cell wall materials and dynamic cell wall modification at the tip region. Although several lines of indirect evidence support the idea that expansin-mediated wall modification occurs during root hair growth, the involvement of these proteins remains to be demonstrated in vivo. In this study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to examine the biological function of Arabidopsis thaliana EXPANSIN A7 (AtEXPA7), which is expressed specifically in the root hair cell. The root hairspecific AtEXPA7 promoter was used to drive RNAi expression, which targeted two independent regions in the AtEXPA7 transcript. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses were used to examine AtEXPA7 transcript levels. In four independent RNAi transformant lines, RNAi expression reduced AtEXPA7 transcript levels by 25-58% compared to controls. Accordingly, the root hairs of RNAi transformant lines were 25-48% shorter than control plants and exhibited a broader range of lengths than the controls. Our results provide in vivo evidence that expansins are required for root hair tip growth.

Abstract: Summary
Sequences rich in glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) residues often fail to fold at the monomer level. This, coupled to their unusual hydrogen-bonding abilities, provides the driving force to switch between disordered monomers and amyloids. Such transitions govern processes as diverse as human protein-folding diseases, bacterial biofilm assembly, and the inheritance of yeast prions (protein-based genetic elements). A systematic survey of prion-forming domains suggested that Q and N residues have distinct effects on amyloid formation. Here, we use cell biological, biochemical, and computational techniques to compare Q/N-rich protein variants, replacing Ns with Qs and Qs with Ns. We find that the two residues have strong and opposing effects: N richness promotes assembly of benign self-templating amyloids; Q richness promotes formation of toxic nonamyloid conformers. Molecular simulations focusing on intrinsic folding differences between Qs and Ns suggest that their different behaviors are due to the enhanced turn-forming propensity of Ns over Qs.

Abstract: We aimed to investigate the application of adipose-derived stromal cells in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Animal models of stress urinary incontinence were established with Sprague–Dawley female rats by complete cutting of the pudendal nerve. Rat adipose-derived stromal cells were isolated, cultured and successfully transplanted into animal models. Effects of stem cell transplantation were evaluated through urodynamic testing and morphologic changes of the urethra and surrounding tissues before and after transplantation. Main urodynamic outcome measures were measured. Intra-bladder pressure and leak point pressure were measured during filling phase. Morphologic examinations were performed. Transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells significantly strengthened local urethral muscle layers and significantly improved the morphology and function of sphincters. Urodynamic testing showed significant improvements in maximum bladder capacity, abdominal leak point pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length. Morphologic changes and significant improvement in urination control were consistent over time. It was concluded that periurethral injection of adipose-derived stromal cells improves function of the striated urethral sphincter, resulting in therapeutic effects on SUI.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer initiating cells (BCICs), which can fully recapitulate the tumor origin and are often resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy, are currently considered as a major obstacle for breast cancer treatment. Here, we show that BIKDD, a constitutively active mutant form of proapoptotic gene, BIK, effectively induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells and synergizes with lapatinib. Most importantly, BikDD significantly reduces BCICs through co-antagonism of its binding partners Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy targeting BCICs. Furthermore, we developed a cancer-specific targeting approach for breast cancer that selectively expresses BikDD in breast cancer cells including BCICs, and demonstrated its potent antitumor activity and synergism with lapatinib in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: We found that the androgenic gland (AG) of Macrobrachium rosenbergii possesses three cell types. Type I cells are small polygonal shaped-cells (13.4μm in diameter), stain strongly with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E), have abundant multilayered rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and nuclei containing mostly heterochromatin. Type II cells are slightly larger (18.6μm in diameter), stain lightly with H&E, have rER with dilated cisternae, and nuclei containing mostly euchromatin. Type III cells (previously undescribed) are similar in size and shape to type I cells, but the cytoplasm is unstained and they have a high amount of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) and mitochondria with tubular cristae. Bilateral eyestalk-ablation resulted in AG hypertrophy with a proliferation and predominance of type I cells as determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Expression of insulin-like androgenic gland hormone (Mr-IAG), determined by immunohistochemistry, was weak in type I cells, strong in type II cells of both the intact and eyestalk-ablated, and negative in type III cells. It was also detected in spermatogonia, nurse cells, and epithelium lining of the spermatic duct. The function of Mr-IAG in these tissues is yet to be elucidated but the distribution implies a strong role in male reproduction.

Abstract: Summary
Mislocated enzymatic activity of DOT1L has been proposed as a driver of leukemogenesis in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). The characterization of EPZ004777, a potent, selective inhibitor of DOT1L is reported. Treatment of MLL cells with the compound selectively inhibits H3K79 methylation and blocks expression of leukemogenic genes. Exposure of leukemic cells to EPZ004777 results in selective killing of those cells bearing the MLL gene translocation, with little effect on non-MLL-translocated cells. Finally, in vivo administration of EPZ004777 leads to extension of survival in a mouse MLL xenograft model. These results provide compelling support for DOT1L inhibition as a basis for targeted therapeutics against MLL.

Abstract: Summary
Genome instability, a hallmark of cancer progression, is thought to arise through DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Studies in yeast and mammalian cells have shown that DSBs and instability can occur through RNA:DNA hybrids generated by defects in RNA elongation and splicing. We report that in yeast hybrids naturally form at many loci in wild-type cells, likely due to transcriptional errors, but are removed by two evolutionarily conserved RNase H enzymes. Mutants defective in transcriptional repression, RNA export and RNA degradation show increased hybrid formation and associated genome instability. One mutant, sin3Δ, changes the genome profile of hybrids, enhancing formation at ribosomal DNA. Hybrids likely induce damage in G1, S and G2/M as assayed by Rad52 foci. In summary, RNA:DNA hybrids are a potent source for changing genome structure. By preventing their formation and accumulation, multiple RNA biogenesis factors and RNase H act as guardians of the genome.

Abstract: Summary
Pin1 is a phospho-specific prolyl isomerase that regulates numerous key signaling molecules and whose deregulation contributes to disease notably cancer. However, since prolyl isomerases are often believed to be constitutively active, little is known whether and how Pin1 catalytic activity is regulated. Here, we identify death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a known tumor suppressor, as a kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Pin1 on Ser71 in the catalytic active site. Such phosphorylation fully inactivates Pin1 catalytic activity and inhibits its nuclear location. Moreover, DAPK1 inhibits the ability of Pin1 to induce centrosome amplification and cell transformation. Finally, Pin1 pSer71 levels are positively correlated with DAPK1 levels and negatively with centrosome amplification in human breast cancer. Thus, phosphorylation of Pin1 Ser71 by DAPK1 inhibits its catalytic activity and cellular function, providing strong evidence for an essential role of the Pin1 enzymatic activity for its cellular function.

Abstract: Summary
The human gene Ptpn11, which encodes the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, may act as a proto-oncogene because dominantly activating mutations have been detected in several types of leukemia. Herein we report a tumor-suppressor function of Shp2. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Shp2 promotes inflammatory signaling through the Stat3 pathway and hepatic inflammation/necrosis, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and development of tumors in aged mice. Furthermore, Shp2 ablation dramatically enhanced diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, which was abolished by concurrent deletion of Shp2 and Stat3 in hepatocytes. Decreased Shp2 expression was detected in a subfraction of human HCC specimens. Thus, in contrast to the leukemogenic effect of dominant-active mutants, Ptpn11/Shp2 has a tumor-suppressor function in liver.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes, and chromatin-remodeling enzymes underpins transcriptional regulation. Although it is known how single domains of chromatin “readers” bind specific histone modifications, how combinations of histone marks are recognized and decoded is poorly understood. Moreover, the role of histone binding in regulating the enzymatic activity of chromatin readers is not known. Here we focus on the TGF-β superfamily transcriptional repressor TIF1γ/TRIM33/Ectodermin and demonstrate that its PHD finger-bromodomain constitutes a multivalent histone-binding module that specifically binds histone H3 tails unmethylated at K4 and R2 and acetylated at two key lysines. TIF1γ's ability to ubiquitinate its substrate Smad4 requires its PHD finger-bromodomain, as does its transcriptional repressor activity. Most importantly, TIF1γ's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is induced by histone binding. We propose a model of TIF1γ activity in which it dictates the residence time of activated Smad complexes at promoters of TGF-β superfamily target genes.

Abstract: Summary
The G protein-coupled receptor TGR5 has been identified as an important component of the bile acid signaling network, and its activation has been linked to enhanced energy expenditure and improved glycemic control. Here, we demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in macrophages by 6α-ethyl-23(S)-methylcholic acid (6-EMCA, INT-777), a semisynthetic BA, inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, an effect mediated by TGR5-induced cAMP signaling and subsequent NF-κB inhibition. TGR5 activation attenuated atherosclerosis in Ldlr−/−Tgr5+/+ mice but not in Ldlr−/−Tgr5−/− double-knockout mice. The inhibition of lesion formation was associated with decreased intraplaque inflammation and less plaque macrophage content. Furthermore, Ldlr−/− animals transplanted with Tgr5−/− bone marrow did not show an inhibition of atherosclerosis by INT-777, further establishing an important role of leukocytes in INT-777-mediated inhibition of vascular lesion formation. Taken together, these data attribute a significant immune modulating function to TGR5 activation in the prevention of atherosclerosis, an important facet of the metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Physical interaction between the phosphorylated RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) and cellular capping enzymes is required for efficient formation of the 5′ mRNA cap, the first modification of nascent mRNA. Here, we report the crystal structure of the RNA guanylyltransferase component of mammalian capping enzyme (Mce) bound to a CTD phosphopeptide. The CTD adopts an extended β-like conformation that docks Tyr1 and Ser5-PO4 onto the Mce nucleotidyltransferase domain. Structure-guided mutational analysis verified that the Mce-CTD interface is a tunable determinant of CTD binding and stimulation of guanylyltransferase activity, and of Mce function in vivo. The location and composition of the CTD binding site on mammalian capping enzyme is distinct from that of a yeast capping enzyme that recognizes the same CTD primary structure. Thus, capping enzymes from different taxa have evolved different strategies to read the CTD code.

Abstract: Summary
Members of sirtuin family regulate multiple critical biological processes, yet their role in carcinogenesis remains controversial. To investigate the physiological functions of SIRT2 in development and tumorigenesis, we disrupted Sirt2 in mice. We demonstrated that SIRT2 regulates the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome activity through deacetylation of its coactivators, APCCDH1 and CDC20. SIRT2 deficiency caused increased levels of mitotic regulators, including Aurora-A and -B that direct centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and mitotic cell death. Sirt2-deficient mice develop gender-specific tumorigenesis, with females primarily developing mammary tumors, and males developing more hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Human breast cancers and HCC samples exhibited reduced SIRT2 levels compared with normal tissues. These data demonstrate that SIRT2 is a tumor suppressor through its role in regulating mitosis and genome integrity.

Abstract: Summary
Although expansion of CAG repeats in ATAXIN1 (ATXN1) causes Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, the functions of ATXN1 and ATAXIN1-Like (ATXN1L) remain poorly understood. To investigate the function of these proteins, we generated and characterized Atxn1L−/− and Atxn1−/−; Atxn1L−/− mice. Atxn1L−/− mice have hydrocephalus, omphalocele, and lung alveolarization defects. These phenotypes are more penetrant and severe in Atxn1−/−; Atxn1L−/− mice, suggesting that ATXN1 and ATXN1L are functionally redundant. Upon pursuing the molecular mechanism, we discovered that several Matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) genes are overexpressed and that the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) is destabilized in Atxn1L−/− lungs. Consistent with this, Cic deficiency causes lung alveolarization defect. Loss of either ATXN1L or CIC derepresses Etv4, an activator for Mmp genes, thereby mediating MMP9 overexpression. These findings demonstrate a critical role of ATXN1/ATXN1L-CIC complexes in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling during development and their potential roles in pathogenesis of disorders affecting ECM remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5mC) in the mammalian genome is a key epigenetic event critical for various cellular processes. The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of 5mC-hydroxylases, which convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), offers a way for dynamic regulation of DNA methylation. Here we report that Tet1 binds to unmodified C or 5mC- or 5hmC-modified CpG-rich DNA through its CXXC domain. Genome-wide mapping of Tet1 and 5hmC reveals mechanisms by which Tet1 controls 5hmC and 5mC levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We also uncover a comprehensive gene network influenced by Tet1. Collectively, our data suggest that Tet1 controls DNA methylation both by binding to CpG-rich regions to prevent unwanted DNA methyltransferase activity, and by converting 5mC to 5hmC through hydroxylase activity. This Tet1-mediated antagonism of CpG methylation imparts differential maintenance of DNA methylation status at Tet1 targets, ultimately contributing to mESC differentiation and the onset of embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Sumoylation is generally considered a repressive mark for many transcription factors. However, the in vivo importance of sumoylation for any given substrate remains unclear and is questionable because the extent of sumoylation appears exceedingly low for most substrates. Here, we permanently eliminated SF-1/NR5A1 sumoylation in mice (Sf-1K119R, K194R, or 2KR) and found that Sf-12KR/2KR mice failed to phenocopy a simple gain of SF-1 function or show elevated levels of well-established SF-1 target genes. Instead, mutant mice exhibited marked endocrine abnormalities and changes in cell fate that reflected an inappropriate activation of hedgehog signaling and other potential SUMO-sensitive targets. Furthermore, unsumoylatable SF-1 mutants activated Shh and exhibited preferential recruitment to Shh genomic elements in cells. We conclude that the sumoylation cycle greatly expands the functional capacity of transcription factors such as SF-1 and is leveraged during development to achieve cell-type-specific gene expression in multicellular organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Primary tumors have been shown to prepare distal organs for later colonization of metastatic cells by stimulating organ-specific infiltration of bone marrow derived cells. Here we demonstrate that neutrophils accumulate in the lung prior to the arrival of metastatic cells in mouse models of breast cancer. Tumor-entrained neutrophils (TENs) inhibit metastatic seeding in the lungs by generating H2O2 and tumor secreted CCL2 is a critical mediator of optimal antimetastatic entrainment of G-CSF-stimulated neutrophils. TENs are present in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients prior to surgical resection but not in healthy individuals. Thus, whereas tumor-secreted factors contribute to tumor progression at the primary site, they concomitantly induce a neutrophil-mediated inhibitory process at the metastatic site.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers tissue-specific responses that culminate in either cellular adaptation or apoptosis, but the genetic networks distinguishing these responses are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that ER stress induced in the developing zebrafish causes rapid apoptosis in the brain, spinal cord, tail epidermis, lens, and epiphysis. Focusing on the tail epidermis, we uncover an apoptotic response that depends on Puma, but not on p53 or Chop. puma is transcriptionally activated during this ER stress response in a p53-independent manner, and is an essential mediator of epidermal apoptosis. We demonstrate that the p63 transcription factor is upregulated to initiate this apoptotic pathway and directly activates puma transcription in response to ER stress. We also show that a mutation of human Connexin 31, which causes erythrokeratoderma variabilis, induces ER stress and p63-dependent epidermal apoptosis in the zebrafish embryo, thus implicating this pathway in the pathogenesis of inherited disease.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the cytoprotective effects of Inonotus obliquus against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and premature senescence. Pretreatment with I. obliquus scavenged intracellular ROS and prevented lipid peroxidation in hydrogen peroxide-treated human fibroblasts. As a result, I. obliquus exerted protective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis and premature senescence in human fibroblasts. In addition, I. obliquus suppressed UV-induced morphologic skin changes, such as skin thickening and wrinkle formation, in hairless mice in vivo and increased collagen synthesis through inhibition of MMP-1 and MMP-9 activities in hydrogen peroxide-treated human fibroblasts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that I. obliquus can prevent the aging process by attenuating oxidative stress in a model of stress-induced premature senescence.

A Strong Promoter Activity of Pre-B Cell Stage-Specific Crlz1 Gene Is Caused by One Distal LEF-1 and Multiple Proximal Ets Sites,

Abstract: The promoter of pre-B cell stage-specific Crlz1 gene, whose protein translocates the cytoplasmic core binding factor β (CBFβ) into the nucleus and thereby allows its heterodimerization with Runx, has a very strong activity, which is about 25% of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter activity and comparable to the EF-1α promoter activity. Its transcription start site was mapped at 155 nt upstream of translation initiation codon. 5’-truncation analysis of charged amino acids rich leucine zipper 1 (Crlz1) promoter revealed that one distal region from -612 to -536 and one proximal region from -198 to -100 as numbered from the transcription start site were critical for the promoter activity. The 3’-truncation analysis of the promoter revealed that the basal promoter sequence around the transcription start site, which should be necessary for the assembly of transcription initiation complex and the start of RNA polymerase II, was also essential, although not sufficient by itself. When transcription factor binding sites within those two critical regions were searched by in vivo footprinting, one distal LEF-1 and multiple proximal Ets consensus-like sites were found to be footprinted. Indeed, the protein causing a footprint over the distal region was found to be LEF-1, and the ones causing three footprints over the proximal region were found to be such Ets family members as Fli-1 and GABP, as verified by EMSA and ChIP analyses. Furthermore, those LEF-1 and Ets sites were shown to drive additively a strong transcription of Crlz1 gene.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic marks such as posttranslational histone modifications specify the functional states of underlying DNA sequences, though how they are maintained after their disruption during DNA replication remains a critical question. We identify the mammalian SWI/SNF-like protein SMARCAD1 as a key factor required for the re-establishment of repressive chromatin. The ATPase activity of SMARCAD1 is necessary for global deacetylation of histones H3/H4. In this way, SMARCAD1 promotes methylation of H3K9, the establishment of heterochromatin, and faithful chromosome segregation. SMARCAD1 associates with transcriptional repressors including KAP1, histone deacetylases HDAC1/2 and the histone methyltransferase G9a/GLP and modulates the interaction of HDAC1 and KAP1 with heterochromatin. SMARCAD1 directly interacts with PCNA, a central component of the replication machinery, and is recruited to sites of DNA replication. Our findings suggest that chromatin remodeling by SMARCAD1 ensures that silenced loci, such as pericentric heterochromatin, are correctly perpetuated.

To identify therapeutic opportunities for oncolytic viral therapy, we conducted genome-wide RNAi screens to search for host factors that modulate rhabdoviral oncolysis. Our screens uncovered the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathways as important modulators of rhabdovirus-mediated cytotoxicity. Further investigation revealed an unconventional mechanism whereby ER stress response inhibition preconditioned cancer cells, which sensitized them to caspase-2-dependent apoptosis induced by a subsequent rhabdovirus infection. Importantly, this mechanism was tumor cell specific, selectively increasing potency of the oncolytic virus by up to 10,000-fold. In vivo studies using a small molecule inhibitor of IRE1α showed dramatically improved oncolytic efficacy in resistant tumor models. Our study demonstrates proof of concept for using functional genomics to improve biotherapeutic agents for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Pathways defining susceptibility of normal cells to oncogenic transformation may be valuable therapeutic targets. We characterized the cell of origin and its critical pathways in MN1-induced leukemias. Common myeloid (CMP) but not granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) could be transformed by MN1. Complementation studies of CMP-signature genes in GMPs demonstrated that MN1-leukemogenicity required the MEIS1/AbdB-like HOX-protein complex. ChIP-sequencing identified common target genes of MN1 and MEIS1 and demonstrated identical binding sites for a large proportion of their chromatin targets. Transcriptional repression of MEIS1 targets in established MN1 leukemias demonstrated antileukemic activity. As MN1 relies on but cannot activate expression of MEIS1/AbdB-like HOX proteins, transcriptional activity of these genes determines cellular susceptibility to MN1-induced transformation and may represent a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can influence cancer progression and metastasis, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that breast TAMs abundantly produce CCL18, and its expression in blood or cancer stroma is associated with metastasis and reduced patient survival. CCL18 released by breast TAMs promotes the invasiveness of cancer cells by triggering integrin clustering and enhancing their adherence to extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we identify PITPNM3 as a functional receptor for CCL18 that mediates CCL18 effect and activates intracellular calcium signaling. CCL18 promotes the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer xenografts, whereas suppressing PITPNM3 abrogates these effects. These findings indicate that CCL18 derived from TAMs plays a critical role in promoting breast cancer metastasis via its receptor, PITPNM3.

Regulated Offloading of Cytoplasmic Dynein from Microtubule Plus Ends to the Cortex,

Abstract: Summary
Cytoplasmic dynein mediates spindle orientation from the cell cortex through interactions with astral microtubules, but neither the mechanism governing its cortical targeting nor the regulation thereof is well understood. Here we show that yeast dynein offloads from microtubule plus ends to the daughter cell cortex. Mutants with an engineered peptide inserted between the tail domain and the motor head retain wild-type motor activity but exhibit enhanced offloading and cortical targeting. Conversely, shortening the “neck” sequence between the tail and motor domains precludes offloading from the microtubule plus ends. Furthermore, chimeric mutants with mammalian dynein “neck” sequences rescue targeting and function. These findings provide direct support for an active microtubule-mediated delivery process that appears to be regulated by a conserved masking/unmasking mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutional epimutations of tumor suppressor genes manifest as promoter methylation and transcriptional silencing of a single allele in normal somatic tissues, thereby predisposing to cancer. Constitutional MLH1 epimutations occur in individuals with young-onset cancer and demonstrate non-Mendelian inheritance through their reversal in the germline. We report a cancer-affected family showing dominant transmission of soma-wide highly mosaic MLH1 methylation and transcriptional repression linked to a particular genetic haplotype. The epimutation was erased in spermatozoa but reinstated in the somatic cells of the next generation. The affected haplotype harbored two single nucleotide substitutions in tandem; c.-27C > A located near the transcription initiation site and c.85G > T. The c.-27C > A variant significantly reduced transcriptional activity in reporter assays and is the probable cause of this epimutation.

Abstract: Summary
Insulators are multiprotein-DNA complexes thought to affect gene expression by mediating inter- and intrachromosomal interactions. Drosophila insulators contain specific DNA-binding proteins plus common components, such as CP190, that facilitate these interactions. Here, we examine changes in the distribution of Drosophila insulator proteins during the heat-shock and ecdysone responses. We find that CP190 recruitment to insulator sites is the main regulatable step in controlling insulator function during heat shock. In contrast, both CP190 and DNA-binding protein recruitment are regulated during the ecdysone response. CP190 is necessary to stabilize specific chromatin loops and for proper activation of transcription of genes regulated by this hormone. These findings suggest that cells may regulate recruitment of insulator proteins to DNA to activate insulator activity at specific sites and create distinct patterns of nuclear organization that are necessary to achieve proper gene expression in response to different stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of apoptosis. Their involvement in other cellular processes has been so far overlooked. We have studied the role of the Bcl-2 homolog Nrz in the developing zebrafish. Nrz was found to be localized to the yolk syncytial layer, a region containing numerous mitochondria and ER membranes. Nrz knockdown resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation, due to free Ca2+ increase in the yolk cell, activating myosin light chain kinase, which led to premature contraction of actin-myosin cables in the margin and separation of the blastomeres from the yolk cell. In the yolk syncytial layer, Nrz appears to prevent the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum by directly interacting with the IP3R1 Ca2+ channel. Thus, the Bcl-2 family may participate in early development, not only by controlling apoptosis but also by acting on cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movements via Ca2+ fluxes inside the embryo.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of apoptosis is critical for controlling tissue homeostasis and preventing tumor formation and growth. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation plays a key role in such regulation. Here, we describe a HIF-1 target, Vasn/ATIA (anti-TNFα-induced apoptosis), which protects cells against TNFα- and hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Through the generation of ATIA knockout mice, we show that ATIA protects cells from apoptosis through regulating the function of the mitochondrial antioxidant, thioredoxin-2, and ROS generation. ATIA is highly expressed in human glioblastoma, and ATIA knockdown in glioblastoma cells renders them sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Therefore, ATIA is not only a HIF-1 target that regulates mitochondrial redox pathways but also a potentially diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in human glioblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular signaling pathways exhibit complex response profiles with features such as thresholds and steep activation (i.e., ultrasensitivity). In a reconstituted mitotic spindle orientation pathway, activation of Drosophila Pins (LGN in mammals) by Gαi is ultrasensitive (apparent Hill coefficient of 3.1), such that Pins recruitment of the microtubule binding protein Mud (NuMA) occurs over a very narrow Gαi concentration range. Ultrasensitivity is required for Pins function in neuroblasts as a nonultrasensitive Pins mutant fails to robustly couple spindle position to cell polarity. Pins contains three Gαi binding GoLoco domains (GLs); Gαi binding to GL3 activates Pins, whereas GLs 1 and 2 shape the response profile. Although cooperative binding is one mechanism for generating ultrasensitivity, we find GLs 1 and 2 act as “decoys” that compete against activation at GL3. Many signaling proteins contain multiple protein interaction domains, and the decoy mechanism may be a common method for generating ultrasensitivity in regulatory pathways.

Abstract: Orthodontic force causes gradual compression of the periodontal ligament tissues, which leads to local hypoxia in the compression side of the tissues. In this study, we investigated whether antioxidants exert a regulatory effect on two factors: the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) that were exposed to mechanical compression and hypoxia and the rate of orthodontic tooth movement in rats. Exposure of PDLFs to mechanical compression (0.5-3.0 g/cm2) or hypoxic conditions increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Hypoxic treatment for 24 h increased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PDLFs. Resveratrol (10 nM) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20 mM) diminished the transcriptional activity of hypoxiainducible factor-1 and hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF. Combined treatment with mechanical compression and hypoxia significantly increased the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and VEGF in PDLFs. These levels were suppressed by NAC and resveratrol. The maxillary first molars of rats were moved mesially for seven days using an orthodontic appliance. NAC decreased the amount of orthodontic tooth movement compared to the vehicle-treated group. The results from immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that NAC suppressed the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in the periodontal ligament tissues compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that antioxidants have the potential to negatively regulate the rate of orthodontic tooth movement through the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the compression sides of periodontal ligament tissues.

Abstract: Summary
A better understanding of the mechanisms through which anticancer drugs exert their effects is essential to improve combination therapies. While studying how genotoxic stress kills cancer cells, we discovered a large ∼2MDa cell death-inducing platform, referred to as “Ripoptosome.” It contains the core components RIP1, FADD, and caspase-8, and assembles in response to genotoxic stress-induced depletion of XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2. Importantly, it forms independently of TNF, CD95L/FASL, TRAIL, death-receptors, and mitochondrial pathways. It also forms upon Smac-mimetic (SM) treatment without involvement of autocrine TNF. Ripoptosome assembly requires RIP1's kinase activity and can stimulate caspase-8-mediated apoptosis as well as caspase-independent necrosis. It is negatively regulated by FLIP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP. Mechanistically, IAPs target components of this complex for ubiquitylation and inactivation. Moreover, we find that etoposide-stimulated Ripoptosome formation converts proinflammatory cytokines into prodeath signals. Together, our observations shed new light on fundamental mechanisms by which chemotherapeutics may kill cancer cells.

Growth Phase-Differential Quorum Sensing Regulation of Anthranilate Metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,

Abstract: Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) plays a role in the regulation of virulence genes and it is intertwined in the las/rhl quorum sensing (QS) circuits of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PQS is synthesized from anthranilate by pqsA-D and pqsH whose expression is influenced by the las/rhl systems. Since anthranilate can be degraded by functions of antABC and catBCA, PQS synthesis might be regulated by the balance between the expression of the pqsA-D/phnAB, pqsH, antABC, and catBCA gene loci. antA and catA are repressed by LasR during log phase and activated by RhlR in late stationary phase, whereas pqsA-E/phnAB is activated by LasR in log phase and repressed by RhlR. QscR represses both but each repression occurs in a different growth phase. This growth phasedifferential regulation appears to be accomplished by the antagonistic interplay of LasR, RhlR, and QscR, mediated by two intermediate regulators, AntR and PqsR, and their cofactors, anthranilate and PQS, where the expressions of antR and pqsR and the production of anthranilate and PQS are growth phase-differentially regulated by QS systems. Especially, the anthranilate level increases in an RhlR-dependent manner at late stationary phase. From these results, we suggest that RhlR and LasR regulate the anthranilate metabolism in a mutually antagonistic and growth phase-differential manner by affecting both the expressions and activities of AntR and PqsR, and that QscR also phase-differentially represses both LasR and RhlR functions in this regulation.

Abstract: In molecular testing using PCR, the target DNA is amplified via PCR and the sequence of interest is investigated via hybridization with short oligonucleotide capture probes that are either in a solution or immobilized on solid supports such as beads or glass slides. In this report, we report the discovery of assembly of DNA complex(es) between a capture probe and multiple strands of the PCR product. The DNA complex most likely has branched structure. The assembly of branched DNA was facilitated by the product of asymmetric PCR. The amount of branched DNA assembled was increased five fold when the asymmetric PCR product was denatured and hybridized with a capture probe all in the same PCR reaction mixture. The major branched DNA species appeared to contain three reverse strands (the strand complementary to the capture probe) and two forward strands. The DNA was sensitive to S1 nuclease suggesting that it had single-stranded gaps. Branched DNA also appeared to be assembled with the capture probes immobilized on the surface of solid support when the product of asymmetric PCR was hybridized. Assembly of the branched DNA was also increased when hybridization was performed in complete PCR reaction mixture suggesting the requirement of DNA synthesis. Integration of asymmetric PCR, heat denaturation and hybridization in the same PCR reaction mixture with the capture probes immobilized on the surface of solid support achieved dramatic increase in the signal and sensitivity of detection of DNA. Such a system should be advantageously applied for development of automated process for detection of DNA.

Abstract: Summary
It has been suspected that cell-cycle progression might be functionally coupled with RNA processing. However, little is known about the role of the precise splicing control in cell-cycle progression. Here, we report that SON, a large Ser/Arg (SR)-related protein, is a splicing cofactor contributing to efficient splicing of cell-cycle regulators. Downregulation of SON leads to severe impairment of spindle pole separation, microtubule dynamics, and genome integrity. These molecular defects result from inadequate RNA splicing of a specific set of cell-cycle-related genes that possess weak splice sites. Furthermore, we show that SON facilitates the interaction of SR proteins with RNA polymerase II and other key spliceosome components, suggesting its function in efficient cotranscriptional RNA processing. These results reveal a mechanism for controlling cell-cycle progression through SON-dependent constitutive splicing at suboptimal splice sites, with strong implications for its role in cancer and other human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are organelles centrally important for bioenergetics as well as regulation of apoptotic death in eukaryotic cells. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an evolutionarily conserved chromatin-associated protein which maintains nuclear homeostasis, is also a critical regulator of mitochondrial function and morphology. We show that heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1 or HSP27) is the downstream mediator of this effect. Disruption of the HSPB1 gene in embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type HMGB1 recapitulates the mitochondrial fragmentation, deficits in mitochondrial respiration, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis observed with targeted deletion of HMGB1. Forced expression of HSPB1 reverses this phenotype in HMGB1 knockout cells. Mitochondrial effects mediated by HMGB1 regulation of HSPB1 expression serve as a defense against mitochondrial abnormality, enabling clearance and autophagy in the setting of cellular stress. Our findings reveal an essential role for HMGB1 in autophagic surveillance with important effects on mitochondrial quality control.

Abstract: Summary
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively activated in certain cancers, following gene alterations such as chromosomal translocation, amplification, or point mutation. Here, we identified CH5424802, a potent, selective, and orally available ALK inhibitor with a unique chemical scaffold, showing preferential antitumor activity against cancers with gene alterations of ALK, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells expressing NPM-ALK fusion in vitro and in vivo. CH5424802 inhibited ALK L1196M, which corresponds to the gatekeeper mutation conferring common resistance to kinase inhibitors, and blocked EML4-ALK L1196M-driven cell growth. Our results support the potential for clinical evaluation of CH5424802 for the treatment of patients with ALK-driven tumors.

Abstract: When the intracellular calcium stores are depleted, a Ca2+ influx is activated to refill these stores. This store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) depends on the cooperation of several proteins as STIM1, Orai1, and, possibly, TRPC1. To elucidate this role of TRPC1 in skeletal muscle, TRPC1 was overexpressed in C2C12 cells and SOCE was studied by measuring the changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). TRPC1 overexpression significantly increased both the amplitude and the maximal rate-of-rise of SOCE. When YM-58483, an inhibitor of TRPC1 was used, these differences were eliminated, moreover, SOCE was slightly suppressed. A decrease in the expression of STIM1 together with the downregulation of SERCA was confirmed by Western-blot. As a consequence, a reduction in maximal Ca2+ uptake rate and a higher resting [Ca2+]i following the Ca2+ transients evoked by 120mM KCl were detected. Morphological changes also accompanied the overexpression of TRPC1. Differentiation of the myoblasts started later, and the myotubes were thinner in TRPC1-overexpressing cultures. For these changes the observed decrease in the nuclear expression of NFAT1 could be responsible. Our results suggest that enhanced expression of TRPC1 increases SOCE and has a negative effect on the STIM1-Orai1 system, indicating an interaction between these proteins.

Failure of Origin Activation in Response to Fork Stalling Leads to Chromosomal Instability at Fragile Sites,

Abstract: Summary
Perturbed DNA replication in early stages of cancer development induces chromosomal instability preferentially at fragile sites. However, the molecular basis for this instability is unknown. Here, we show that even under normal growth conditions, replication fork progression along the fragile site, FRA16C, is slow and forks frequently stall at AT-rich sequences, leading to activation of additional origins to enable replication completion. Under mild replication stress, the frequency of stalling at AT-rich sequences is further increased. Strikingly, unlike in the entire genome, in the FRA16C region additional origins are not activated, suggesting that all potential origins are already activated under normal conditions. Thus, the basis for FRA16C fragility is replication fork stalling at AT-rich sequences and inability to activate additional origins under replication stress. Our results provide a mechanism explaining the replication stress sensitivity of fragile sites and thus, the basis for genomic instability during early stages of cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme required for DNA synthesis and repair. Although iron is necessary for class Ia RNR activity, little is known about the mechanisms that control RNR in response to iron deficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that yeast cells control RNR function during iron deficiency by redistributing the Rnr2-Rnr4 small subunit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our data support a Mec1/Rad53-independent mechanism in which the iron-regulated Cth1/Cth2 mRNA-binding proteins specifically interact with the WTM1 mRNA in response to iron scarcity and promote its degradation. The resulting decrease in the nuclear-anchoring Wtm1 protein levels leads to the redistribution of the Rnr2-Rnr4 heterodimer to the cytoplasm, where it assembles as an active RNR complex and increases deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels. When iron is scarce, yeast selectively optimizes RNR function at the expense of other non-essential iron-dependent processes that are repressed, to allow DNA synthesis and repair.

Abstract: Summary
TFIIE and the archaeal homolog TFE enhance DNA strand separation of eukaryotic RNAPII and the archaeal RNAP during transcription initiation by an unknown mechanism. We have developed a fluorescently labeled recombinant M. jannaschii RNAP system to probe the archaeal transcription initiation complex, consisting of promoter DNA, TBP, TFB, TFE, and RNAP. We have localized the position of the TFE winged helix (WH) and Zinc ribbon (ZR) domains on the RNAP using single-molecule FRET. The interaction sites of the TFE WH domain and the transcription elongation factor Spt4/5 overlap, and both factors compete for RNAP binding. Binding of Spt4/5 to RNAP represses promoter-directed transcription in the absence of TFE, which alleviates this effect by displacing Spt4/5 from RNAP. During elongation, Spt4/5 can displace TFE from the RNAP elongation complex and stimulate processivity. Our results identify the RNAP “clamp” region as a regulatory hot spot for both transcription initiation and transcription elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic differentiation critically depends on combinations of transcriptional regulators controlling the development of individual lineages. Here, we report the genome-wide binding sites for the five key hematopoietic transcription factors—GATA1, GATA2, RUNX1, FLI1, and TAL1/SCL—in primary human megakaryocytes. Statistical analysis of the 17,263 regions bound by at least one factor demonstrated that simultaneous binding by all five factors was the most enriched pattern and often occurred near known hematopoietic regulators. Eight genes not previously appreciated to function in hematopoiesis that were bound by all five factors were shown to be essential for thrombocyte and/or erythroid development in zebrafish. Moreover, one of these genes encoding the PDZK1IP1 protein shared transcriptional enhancer elements with the blood stem cell regulator TAL1/SCL. Multifactor ChIP-Seq analysis in primary human cells coupled with a high-throughput in vivo perturbation screen therefore offers a powerful strategy to identify essential regulators of complex mammalian differentiation processes.

Abstract: Summary
E3 ligases mediate the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins thereby enabling ubiquitin-dependent signaling. Unraveling how E3 ligases are regulated is important because miscontrolled ubiquitylation can lead to disease. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins are E3 ligases that modulate diverse biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Here, we have solved the structure of the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of cIAP1 and identified that it is required for cIAP1 autoregulation. We demonstrate that the CARD inhibits activation of cIAP1's E3 activity by preventing RING dimerization, E2 binding, and E2 activation. Moreover, we show that the CARD is required to suppress cell proliferation and migration. Further, CARD-mediated autoregulation is also necessary to maximally suppress caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and vascular tree degeneration in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal mechanisms by which the E3 ligase activity of cIAP1 is controlled, and how its deregulation impacts on cell proliferation, migration and cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) restricts mitotic exit to cells that have completed chromosome-microtubule attachment. Cdc20 is a bifunctional protein. In complex with SAC proteins Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3, Cdc20 forms the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which binds the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and inhibits its mitotic exit-promoting activity. When devoid of SAC proteins, Cdc20 serves as an APC/C coactivator and promotes mitotic exit. During mitotic arrest, Cdc20 is continuously degraded via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and resynthesized. It is believed that this cycle keeps the levels of Cdc20 below a threshold above which Cdc20 would promote mitotic exit. We report that p31comet, a checkpoint antagonist, is necessary for mitotic destabilization of Cdc20. p31comet depletion stabilizes the MCC, super-inhibits the APC/C, and delays mitotic exit, indicating that Cdc20 proteolysis in prometaphase opposes the checkpoint. Our studies reveal a homeostatic network in which checkpoint-sustaining and -repressing forces oppose each other during mitotic arrest and suggest ways for enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.

Ouabain enhances exocytosis through the regulation of calcium handling by the endoplasmic reticulum of chromaffin cells,

Abstract: The augmentation of neurotransmitter and hormone release produced by ouabain inhibition of plasmalemmal Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is well established. However, the mechanism underlying this action is still controversial. Here we have shown that in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells ouabain diminished the mobility of chromaffin vesicles, an indication of greater number of docked vesicles at subplasmalemmal exocytotic sites. On the other hand, ouabain augmented the number of vesicles undergoing exocytosis in response to a K+ pulse, rather than the quantal size of single vesicles. Furthermore, ouabain produced a tiny and slow Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and gradually augmented the transient elevations of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c) triggered by K+ pulses. These effects were paralleled by gradual increments of the transient catecholamine release responses triggered by sequential K+ pulses applied to chromaffin cell populations treated with ouabain. Both, the increases of K+-elicited [Ca2+]c and secretion in ouabain-treated cells were blocked by thapsigargin (THAPSI), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and caffeine. These results are compatible with the view that ouabain may enhance the ER Ca2+ load and facilitate the Ca2+-induced-Ca2+ release (CICR) component of the [Ca2+]c signal generated during K+ depolarisation. This could explain the potentiating effects of ouabain on exocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
A human genome-wide linkage scan for obesity identified a linkage peak on chromosome 5q13–15. Positional cloning revealed an association of a rare haplotype to high body-mass index (BMI) in males but not females. The risk locus contains a single gene, “arrestin domain-containing 3” (ARRDC3), an uncharacterized α-arrestin. Inactivating Arrdc3 in mice led to a striking resistance to obesity, with greater impact on male mice. Mice with decreased ARRDC3 levels were protected from obesity due to increased energy expenditure through increased activity levels and increased thermogenesis of both brown and white adipose tissues. ARRDC3 interacted directly with β-adrenergic receptors, and loss of ARRDC3 increased the response to β-adrenergic stimulation in isolated adipose tissue. These results demonstrate that ARRDC3 is a gender-sensitive regulator of obesity and energy expenditure and reveal a surprising diversity for arrestin family protein functions.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic instability of cancer cells frequently causes drug resistance. We established mouse cancer models, which allowed targeting of an oncogene by drug-mediated inactivation or monospecific CD8+ effector T (TE) cells. Drug treatment of genetically unstable large tumors was effective but selected resistant clones in the long term. In contrast, TE cells completely rejected large tumors (≥500 mm3), if the target antigen was cancer-driving and expressed in sufficient amounts. Although drug-mediated oncogene inactivation selectively killed the cancer cells and left the tumor vasculature intact, which likely facilitated survival and growth of resistant clones, TE cell treatment led to blood vessel destruction and probably “bystander” elimination of escape variants, which did not require antigen cross-presentation by stromal cells.
