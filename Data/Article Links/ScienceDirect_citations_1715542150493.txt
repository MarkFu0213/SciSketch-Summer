Abstract: Summary
Melanoma accounts for more than 80% of skin cancer-related deaths, and current therapies provide only short-term benefit to patients. Here, we show in melanoma cells that maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is transcriptionally upregulated by the MAPK pathway via transcription factor E2F1. MELK knockdown or pharmacological inhibition blocked melanoma growth and enhanced the effectiveness of BRAFV600E inhibitor against melanoma cells. To identify mediators of MELK function, we performed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and identified 469 proteins that had downregulated phosphorylation after MELK inhibition. Of these proteins, 139 were previously reported as substrates of BRAF or MEK, demonstrating that MELK is an important downstream mediator of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we show that MELK promotes melanoma growth by activating NF-κB pathway activity via Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62). Altogether, these results underpin an important role for MELK in melanoma growth downstream of the MAPK pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, are crucial for host recognition of non-self RNAs, especially viral RNA. Thus, the expression and activation of RLRs play fundamental roles in eliminating the invading RNA viruses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, how RLR expression is tightly regulated remains to be further investigated. In this study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded gene, tripartite interaction motif 40 (TRIM40), as a suppressor of RLR signaling by directly targeting MDA5 and RIG-I. TRIM40 binds to MDA5 and RIG-I and promotes their K27- and K48-linked polyubiquitination via its E3 ligase activity, leading to their proteasomal degradation. TRIM40 deficiency enhances RLR-triggered signaling. Consequently, TRIM40 deficiency greatly enhances antiviral immune responses and decreases viral replication in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM40 limits RLR-triggered innate activation, suggesting TRIM40 as a potential therapeutic target for the control of viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that microfluidic organ-on-a-chip (organ chip) cell culture technology can be used to create in vitro human orthotopic models of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that recapitulate organ microenvironment-specific cancer growth, tumor dormancy, and responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy observed in human patients in vivo. Use of the mechanical actuation functionalities of this technology revealed a previously unknown sensitivity of lung cancer cell growth, invasion, and TKI therapeutic responses to physical cues associated with breathing motions, which appear to be mediated by changes in signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET protein kinase. These findings might help to explain the high level of resistance to therapy in cancer patients with minimal residual disease in regions of the lung that remain functionally aerated and mobile, in addition to providing an experimental model to study cancer persister cells and mechanisms of tumor dormancy in vitro.

Structural Basis for Polyproline-Mediated Ribosome Stalling and Rescue by the Translation Elongation Factor EF-P,

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes synthesizing proteins containing consecutive proline residues become stalled and require rescue via the action of uniquely modified translation elongation factors, EF-P in bacteria, or archaeal/eukaryotic a/eIF5A. To date, no structures exist of EF-P or eIF5A in complex with translating ribosomes stalled at polyproline stretches, and thus structural insight into how EF-P/eIF5A rescue these arrested ribosomes has been lacking. Here we present cryo-EM structures of ribosomes stalled on proline stretches, without and with modified EF-P. The structures suggest that the favored conformation of the polyproline-containing nascent chain is incompatible with the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome and leads to destabilization of the peptidyl-tRNA. Binding of EF-P stabilizes the P-site tRNA, particularly via interactions between its modification and the CCA end, thereby enforcing an alternative conformation of the polyproline-containing nascent chain, which allows a favorable substrate geometry for peptide bond formation.

Abstract: Summary
The heavy chain IGHV1-69 germline gene exhibits a high level of polymorphism and shows biased use in protective antibody (Ab) responses to infections and vaccines. It is also highly expressed in several B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. G6 is an anti-idiotypic monoclonal Ab that selectively binds to IGHV1-69 heavy chain germline gene 51p1 alleles that have been implicated in these Ab responses and disease processes. Here, we determine the co-crystal structure of humanized G6 (hG6.3) in complex with anti-influenza hemagglutinin stem-directed broadly neutralizing Ab D80. The core of the hG6.3 idiotope is a continuous string of CDR-H2 residues starting with M53 and ending with N58. G6 binding studies demonstrate the remarkable breadth of binding to 51p1 IGHV1-69 Abs with diverse CDR-H3, light chain, and antigen binding specificities. These studies detail the broad expression of the G6 cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) that further define its potential role in precision medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal oscillations in the rat hippocampus relate to both memory and locomotion, raising the question of how these cognitive and behavioral correlates interact to determine the oscillatory network state of this region. Here, rats freely locomoted while performing an object-location task designed to test hippocampus-dependent spatial associative memory. Rhythmic activity in theta, beta, slow gamma, and fast gamma frequency ranges were observed in both action potentials and local field potentials (LFPs) across four main hippocampal subregions. Several patterns of LFP oscillations corresponded to overt behavior (e.g., increased dentate gyrus-CA3 beta coherence during stationary moments and CA1-subiculum theta coherence during locomotion). In comparison, slow gamma (∼40 Hz) oscillations throughout the hippocampus related most specifically to object-location associative memory encoding rather than overt behavior. The results help to untangle how hippocampal oscillations relate to both memory and motion and single out slow gamma oscillations as a distinguishing correlate of spatial associative memory.

Abstract: Summary
Under conditions of homeostasis, dynamic changes in the length of individual adherens junctions (AJs) provide epithelia with the fluidity required to maintain tissue integrity in the face of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. While the contribution of AJ remodeling to developmental morphogenesis has been intensively studied, less is known about AJ dynamics in other circumstances. Here, we study AJ dynamics in an epithelium that undergoes a gradual increase in packing order, without concomitant large-scale changes in tissue size or shape. We find that neighbor exchange events are driven by stochastic fluctuations in junction length, regulated in part by junctional actomyosin. In this context, the developmental increase of isotropic junctional actomyosin reduces the rate of neighbor exchange, contributing to tissue order. We propose a model in which the local variance in tension between junctions determines whether actomyosin-based forces will inhibit or drive the topological transitions that either refine or deform a tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Isolated methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria (MMA) is a devastating metabolic disorder with poor outcomes despite current medical treatments. Like other mitochondrial enzymopathies, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is not available, and although promising, AAV gene therapy can be limited by pre-existing immunity and has been associated with genotoxicity in mice. To develop a new class of therapy for MMA, we generated a 5-methoxyU-modified codon-optimized mRNA encoding human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (hMUT), the enzyme most frequently mutated in MMA, and encapsulated it into biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of hMUT mRNA in two different mouse models of MMA resulted in a 75%–85% reduction in plasma methylmalonic acid and was associated with increased hMUT protein expression and activity in liver. Repeat dosing of hMUT mRNA reduced circulating metabolites and dramatically improved survival and weight gain. Additionally, repeat i.v. dosing did not increase markers of liver toxicity or inflammation in heterozygote MMA mice.

Abstract: Summary
A mesenchymal transition occurs both during the natural evolution of glioblastoma (GBM) and in response to therapy. Here, we report that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR56/ADGRG1, inhibits GBM mesenchymal differentiation and radioresistance. GPR56 is enriched in proneural and classical GBMs and is lost during their transition toward a mesenchymal subtype. GPR56 loss of function promotes mesenchymal differentiation and radioresistance of glioma initiating cells both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, a low GPR56-associated signature is prognostic of a poor outcome in GBM patients even within non-G-CIMP GBMs. Mechanistically, we reveal GPR56 as an inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, thereby providing the rationale by which this receptor prevents mesenchymal differentiation and radioresistance. A pan-cancer analysis suggests that GPR56 might be an inhibitor of the mesenchymal transition across multiple tumor types beyond GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila spermatogenesis constitutes a paradigmatic system to study maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation of adult stem cell lineages. Each Drosophila testis contains 6–12 germ stem cells (GSCs) that divide asymmetrically to produce gonialblast cells that undergo four transit-amplifying (TA) spermatogonial divisions before entering spermatocyte differentiation. Mechanisms governing these crucial transitions are not fully understood. Here, we report the essential role of the germline linker histone dBigH1 during early spermatogenesis. Our results suggest that dBigH1 is a general silencing factor that represses Bam, a key regulator of spermatogonia proliferation that is silenced in spermatocytes. Reciprocally, Bam represses dBigH1 during TA divisions. This double-repressor mechanism switches dBigH1/Bam expression from off/on in spermatogonia to on/off in spermatocytes, regulating progression into spermatocyte differentiation. dBigH1 is also required for GSC maintenance and differentiation. These results show the critical importance of germline H1s for male GSC lineage differentiation, unveiling a regulatory interaction that couples transcriptional and translational repression.

Abstract: Summary
The BCL-2 family proteins are central regulators of apoptosis. However, cells deficient for BAX and BAK or overexpressing BCL-2 still succumb to oxidative stress upon DNA damage or matrix detachment. Here, we show that ΔNp63α overexpression protects cells from oxidative stress induced by oxidants, DNA damage, anoikis, or ferroptosis-inducing agents. Conversely, ΔNp63α deficiency increases oxidative stress. Mechanistically, ΔNp63α orchestrates redox homeostasis through transcriptional control of glutathione biogenesis, utilization, and regeneration. Analysis of a lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that TP63 amplification/overexpression upregulates the glutathione metabolism pathway in primary human tumors. Strikingly, overexpression of ΔNp63α promotes clonogenic survival of p53−/−Bax−/−Bak−/− cells against DNA damage. Furthermore, co-expression of BCL-2 and ΔNp63α confers clonogenic survival against matrix detachment, disrupts the luminal clearance of mammary acini, and promotes cancer metastasis. Our findings highlight the need for a simultaneous blockade of apoptosis and oxidative stress to promote long-term cellular well-being.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic mutations in BRAF are believed to initiate serrated colorectal cancers; however, the mechanisms of BRAF-driven colon cancer are unclear. We find that oncogenic BRAF paradoxically suppresses stem cell renewal and instead promotes differentiation. Correspondingly, tumor formation is inefficient in BRAF-driven mouse models of colon cancer. By reducing levels of differentiation via genetic manipulation of either of two distinct differentiation-promoting factors (Smad4 or Cdx2), stem cell activity is restored in BRAFV600E intestines, and the oncogenic capacity of BRAFV600E is amplified. In human patients, we observe that reduced levels of differentiation in normal tissue is associated with increased susceptibility to serrated colon tumors. Together, these findings help resolve the conditions necessary for BRAF-driven colon cancer initiation. Additionally, our results predict that genetic and/or environmental factors that reduce tissue differentiation will increase susceptibility to serrated colon cancer. These findings offer an opportunity to identify susceptible individuals by assessing their tissue-differentiation status.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in tumor cells is predominately in the latent phase, but the virus can undergo lytic reactivation in response to various stimuli. However, the cellular factors that control latency and lytic replication are poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrated that a cellular factor, PIAS1, restricts EBV lytic replication. PIAS1 depletion significantly facilitated EBV reactivation, while PIAS1 reconstitution had the opposite effect. Remarkably, we found that various lytic triggers promote caspase-dependent cleavage of PIAS1 to antagonize PIAS1-mediated restriction and that caspase inhibition suppresses EBV replication through blocking PIAS1 cleavage. We further demonstrated that a cleavage-resistant PIAS1 mutant suppresses EBV replication upon B cell receptor activation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PIAS1 acts as an inhibitor for transcription factors involved in lytic gene expression. Collectively, these results establish PIAS1 as a key regulator of EBV lytic replication and uncover a mechanism by which EBV exploits apoptotic caspases to antagonize PIAS1-mediated restriction.

Abstract: Summary
GATA transcription factors and their FOG cofactors play a key role in tissue-specific development and differentiation, from worms to humans. Mammals have six GATA and two FOG factors. We recently demonstrated that interactions between retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and GATA-1 are crucial for erythroid proliferation and differentiation. We show here that the LXCXE pRb-binding site of FOG-2 is involved in adipogenesis. Unlike GATA-1, which inhibits cell division, FOG-2 promotes proliferation. Mice with a knockin of a Fog2 gene bearing a mutated LXCXE pRb-binding site are resistant to obesity and display higher rates of white-to-brown fat conversion. Thus, each component of the GATA/FOG complex (GATA-1 and FOG-2) is involved in pRb/E2F regulation, but these molecules have markedly different roles in the control of tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin triggers an extensive signaling cascade to coordinate adipocyte glucose metabolism. It is considered that the major role of insulin is to provide anabolic substrates by activating GLUT4-dependent glucose uptake. However, insulin stimulates phosphorylation of many metabolic proteins. To examine the implications of this on glucose metabolism, we performed dynamic tracer metabolomics in cultured adipocytes treated with insulin. Temporal analysis of metabolite concentrations and tracer labeling revealed rapid and distinct changes in glucose metabolism, favoring specific glycolytic branch points and pyruvate anaplerosis. Integrating dynamic metabolomics and phosphoproteomics data revealed that insulin-dependent phosphorylation of anabolic enzymes occurred prior to substrate accumulation. Indeed, glycogen synthesis was activated independently of glucose supply. We refer to this phenomenon as metabolic priming, whereby insulin signaling creates a demand-driven system to “pull” glucose into specific anabolic pathways. This complements the supply-driven regulation of anabolism by substrate accumulation and highlights an additional role for insulin action in adipocyte glucose metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The host metalloprotease meprin β is required for mucin 2 (MUC2) cleavage, which drives intestinal mucus detachment and prevents bacterial overgrowth. To gain access to the cleavage site in MUC2, meprin β must be proteolytically shed from epithelial cells. Hence, regulation of meprin β shedding and activation is important for physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate that meprin β activation and shedding are mutually exclusive events. Employing ex vivo small intestinal organoid and cell culture experiments, we found that ADAM-mediated shedding is restricted to the inactive pro-form of meprin β and is completely inhibited upon its conversion to the active form at the cell surface. This strict regulation of meprin β activity can be overridden by pathogens, as demonstrated for the bacterial protease Arg-gingipain (RgpB). This secreted cysteine protease potently converts membrane-bound meprin β into its active form, impairing meprin β shedding and its function as a mucus-detaching protease.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras. Stabilization of MLL provides us with a paradigm in the development of therapies for aggressive MLL leukemia and perhaps for other cancers caused by translocations.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosomes are believed to carry epigenetic information through the cell cycle, including through DNA replication. It has been known for decades that parental histones are reassembled on newly replicated chromatin, but the mechanisms underlying histone inheritance and dispersal during DNA replication are not fully understood. We monitored the fate of histones H3 or H4 from a single nucleosome through DNA replication in two in vitro systems. In the SV40 system, histones assembled on a single nucleosome positioning sequence can be inherited by their own daughter DNA but are dispersed from their original location. In Xenopus laevis extracts, histones are dynamic, and nucleosomes are repositioned independent of and prior to DNA replication. Nevertheless, a high fraction of histones H3 and H4 that are inherited through DNA replication remains near its starting location. Thus, inheritance of histone proteins and their dispersal can be mechanistically uncoupled.

Abstract: Summary
Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (HCS), a rare autosomal disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in NOTCH2, is clinically characterized by acro-osteolysis, severe osteoporosis, short stature, neurological symptoms, cardiovascular defects, and polycystic kidneys. Recent studies identified that aberrant NOTCH2 signaling and consequent osteoclast hyperactivity are closely associated with the bone-related disorder pathogenesis, but the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sustained osteoclast activity is largely due to accumulation of NOTCH2 carrying a truncated C terminus that escapes FBW7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Mice with osteoclast-specific Fbw7 ablation revealed osteoporotic phenotypes reminiscent of HCS, due to elevated Notch2 signaling. Importantly, administration of Notch inhibitors in Fbw7 conditional knockout mice alleviated progressive bone resorption. These findings highlight the molecular basis of HCS pathogenesis and provide clinical insights into potential targeted therapeutic strategies for skeletal disorders associated with the aberrant FBW7/NOTCH2 pathway as observed in patients with HCS.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of ZIKV infection has prompted a global effort to develop safe and effective vaccines. We engineered a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding wild-type or variant ZIKV structural genes and tested immunogenicity and protection in mice. Two doses of modified mRNA LNPs encoding prM-E genes that produced virus-like particles resulted in high neutralizing antibody titers (∼1/100,000) that protected against ZIKV infection and conferred sterilizing immunity. To offset a theoretical concern of ZIKV vaccines inducing antibodies that cross-react with the related dengue virus (DENV), we designed modified prM-E RNA encoding mutations destroying the conserved fusion-loop epitope in the E protein. This variant protected against ZIKV and diminished production of antibodies enhancing DENV infection in cells or mice. A modified mRNA vaccine can prevent ZIKV disease and be adapted to reduce the risk of sensitizing individuals to subsequent exposure to DENV, should this become a clinically relevant concern.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels underlie the control of rhythmic activity in cardiac and neuronal pacemaker cells. In HCN, the polarity of voltage dependence is uniquely reversed. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels tune the voltage response, enabling sympathetic nerve stimulation to increase the heart rate. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human HCN channel in the absence and presence of cAMP at 3.5 Å resolution. HCN channels contain a K+ channel selectivity filter-forming sequence from which the amino acids create a unique structure that explains Na+ and K+ permeability. The voltage sensor adopts a depolarized conformation, and the pore is closed. An S4 helix of unprecedented length extends into the cytoplasm, contacts the C-linker, and twists the inner helical gate shut. cAMP binding rotates cytoplasmic domains to favor opening of the inner helical gate. These structures advance understanding of ion selectivity, reversed polarity gating, and cAMP regulation in HCN channels.

Abstract: Summary
In animal cells, nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) is required for proper chromosome segregation. Whereas mitotic kinases have been implicated in NEBD, how they coordinate their activity to trigger this event is unclear. Here, we show that both in human cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, the Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) is recruited to the nuclear pore complexes, just prior to NEBD, through its Polo-box domain (PBD). We provide evidence that PLK-1 localization to the nuclear envelope (NE) is required for efficient NEBD. We identify the central channel nucleoporins NPP-1/Nup58, NPP-4/Nup54, and NPP-11/Nup62 as the critical factors anchoring PLK-1 to the NE in C. elegans. In particular, NPP-1, NPP-4, and NPP-11 primed at multiple Polo-docking sites by Cdk1 and PLK-1 itself physically interact with the PLK-1 PBD. We conclude that nucleoporins play an unanticipated regulatory role in NEBD, by recruiting PLK-1 to the NE thereby facilitating phosphorylation of critical downstream targets.

Abstract: Summary
Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress immune responses, are highly proliferative in vivo. However, it remains unclear how the active replication of Treg cells is maintained in vivo. Here, we show that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including isoleucine, are required for maintenance of the proliferative state of Treg cells via the amino acid transporter Slc3a2-dependent metabolic reprogramming. Mice fed BCAA-reduced diets showed decreased numbers of Foxp3+ Treg cells with defective in vivo proliferative capacity. Mice lacking Slc3a2 specifically in Foxp3+ Treg cells showed impaired in vivo replication and decreased numbers of Treg cells. Slc3a2-deficient Treg cells showed impaired isoleucine-induced activation of the mTORC1 pathway and an altered metabolic state. Slc3a2 mutant mice did not show an isoleucine-induced increase of Treg cells in vivo and exhibited multi-organ inflammation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that BCAA controls Treg cell maintenance via Slc3a2-dependent metabolic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The hallmark of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an inherited disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the SMN protein, is the selective degeneration of subsets of spinal motor neurons. Here, we show that cell-autonomous activation of p53 occurs in vulnerable but not resistant motor neurons of SMA mice at pre-symptomatic stages. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of p53 prevents motor neuron death, demonstrating that induction of p53 signaling drives neurodegeneration. At late disease stages, however, nuclear accumulation of p53 extends to resistant motor neurons and spinal interneurons but is not associated with cell death. Importantly, we identify phosphorylation of serine 18 as a specific post-translational modification of p53 that exclusively marks vulnerable SMA motor neurons and provide evidence that amino-terminal phosphorylation of p53 is required for the neurodegenerative process. Our findings indicate that distinct events induced by SMN deficiency converge on p53 to trigger selective death of vulnerable SMA motor neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila pharyngeal taste organs are poorly characterized despite their location at important sites for monitoring food quality. Functional analysis of pharyngeal neurons has been hindered by the paucity of molecular tools to manipulate them, as well as their relative inaccessibility for neurophysiological investigations. Here, we generate receptor-to-neuron maps of all three pharyngeal taste organs by performing a comprehensive chemoreceptor-GAL4/LexA expression analysis. The organization of pharyngeal neurons reveals similarities and distinctions in receptor repertoires and neuronal groupings compared to external taste neurons. We validate the mapping results by pinpointing a single pharyngeal neuron required for feeding avoidance of L-canavanine. Inducible activation of pharyngeal taste neurons reveals functional differences between external and internal taste neurons and functional subdivision within pharyngeal sweet neurons. Our results provide roadmaps of pharyngeal taste organs in an insect model system for probing the role of these understudied neurons in controlling feeding behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Secretory cells produce diverse cargoes, yet how they regulate concomitant secretory traffic remains insufficiently explored. Rab GTPases control intracellular vesicular transport. To map secretion pathways, we generated a library of lentivirus-expressed dominant-negative Rab mutants and used it in a large-scale screen to identify regulators of hepatic lipoprotein secretion. We identified several candidate pathways, including those mediated by Rab11 and Rab8. Surprisingly, inhibition of Rab1b, the major regulator of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, differently affected the secretion of the very-low-density lipoprotein components ApoE and ApoB100, despite their final association on mature secreted lipoprotein particles. Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) incorporates ApoE and ApoB100 into its virus particle, we also investigated infectious HCV secretion and show that its regulation by Rab1b mirrors that of ApoB100. These observations reveal differential regulation of hepatocyte secretion by Rab1b and advance our understanding of lipoprotein assembly and lipoprotein and HCV secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful cellular differentiation requires temporally precise activation of gene expression programs, which are coordinated at the transcriptional and translational levels. Neurons express the most complex set of mRNAs of any human tissue, but translational changes during neuronal differentiation remain incompletely understood. Here, we induced forebrain neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and measured genome-wide RNA and translation levels with transcript-isoform resolution. We found that thousands of genes change translation status during differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identified mTOR signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs. In contrast, translational repression in active neurons is mediated by regulatory sequences in 3′ UTRs. Together, our findings identify extensive translational control changes during human neuronal differentiation and a crucial role of 3′ UTRs in driving cell-type-specific translation.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced activity of nutrient-sensing signaling networks can extend organismal lifespan, yet the underlying biology remains unclear. We show that the anti-aging effects of rapamycin and reduced intestinal insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) require the Drosophila FoxA transcription factor homolog Fork Head (FKH). Intestinal FKH induction extends lifespan, highlighting a role for the gut. FKH binds to and is phosphorylated by AKT and Target of Rapamycin. Gut-specific FKH upregulation improves gut barrier function in aged flies. Additionally, it increases the expression of nutrient transporters, as does lowered IIS. Evolutionary conservation of this effect of lowered IIS is suggested by the upregulation of related nutrient transporters in insulin receptor substrate 1 knockout mouse intestine. Our study highlights a critical role played by FKH in the gut in mediating anti-aging effects of reduced IIS. Malnutrition caused by poor intestinal absorption is a major problem in the elderly, and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved will have important therapeutic implications for human aging.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of CDK4 in the cell cycle have been extensively studied, but less is known about the mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation by CDK4. Here, we report that CDK4 promotes anaerobic glycolysis and represses fatty acid oxidation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by targeting the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We also show that fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is specifically induced by AMPK complexes containing the α2 subunit. Moreover, we report that CDK4 represses FAO through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPKα2. The expression of non-phosphorylatable AMPKα2 mutants, or the use of a CDK4 inhibitor, increased FAO rates in MEFs and myotubes. In addition, Cdk4−/− mice have increased oxidative metabolism and exercise capacity. Inhibition of CDK4 mimicked these alterations in normal mice, but not when skeletal muscle was AMPK deficient. This novel mechanism explains how CDK4 promotes anabolism by blocking catabolic processes (FAO) that are activated by AMPK.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic transmission is critically dependent on synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling. Although the precise mechanisms of SV retrieval are still debated, it is widely accepted that a fundamental role is played by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a form of endocytosis that capitalizes on the clathrin/adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2) coat and several accessory factors. Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized protein KIAA1107, predicted by bioinformatics analysis to be involved in the SV cycle, is an AP2-interacting clathrin-endocytosis protein (APache). We found that APache is highly enriched in the CNS and is associated with clathrin-coated vesicles via interaction with AP2. APache-silenced neurons exhibit a severe impairment of maturation at early developmental stages, reduced SV density, enlarged endosome-like structures, and defects in synaptic transmission, consistent with an impaired clathrin/AP2-mediated SV recycling. Our data implicate APache as an actor in the complex regulation of SV trafficking, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Colon cancer is a heterogeneous tumor driven by a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). To study CSCs in colon cancer, we used limiting dilution spheroid and serial xenotransplantation assays to functionally define the frequency of CSCs in a panel of patient-derived cancer organoids. These studies demonstrated cancer organoids to be enriched for CSCs, which varied in frequency between tumors. Whole-transcriptome analysis identified WNT and Hedgehog signaling components to be enhanced in CSC-enriched tumors and in aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSCs. Canonical GLI-dependent Hedgehog signaling is a negative regulator of WNT signaling in normal intestine and intestinal tumors. Here, we show that Hedgehog signaling in colon CSCs is autocrine SHH-dependent, non-canonical PTCH1 dependent, and GLI independent. In addition, using small-molecule inhibitors and RNAi against SHH-palmitoylating Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), we demonstrate that non-canonical Hedgehog signaling is a positive regulator of WNT signaling and required for colon CSC survival.

Abstract: Summary
Elimination of lymphoid tissue reservoirs is a key component of HIV eradication strategies. CD8+ T cells play a critical role in control of HIV, but their functional attributes in lymph nodes (LNs) remain unclear. Here, we show that memory, follicular CXCR5+, and HIV-specific CD8+ T cells from LNs do not manifest the properties of cytolytic CD8+ T cells. While the frequency of follicular CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells was strongly inversely associated with peripheral viremia, this association was not dependent on cytolytic CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the poor cytolytic activity of LN CD8+ T cells was linked to a compartmentalized dissociation between effector programming and the transcription factor T-bet. In line with this, activation of LN CD8+ T cells only partially induced the acquisition of cytolytic functions relative to peripheral blood CD8+ T cells. These results suggest that a state of immune privilege against CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolysis exists in lymphoid tissue, potentially facilitating the persistence of HIV.

Abstract: Summary
Liver cancer has become the second most deadly malignant disease, with no efficient targeted or immune therapeutic agents available yet. While dissecting the roles of cytoplasmic signaling molecules in hepatocarcinogenesis using an inducible mouse gene targeting system, Mx1-cre, we identified a potent liver tumor-inhibitory effect of synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIC), an inducer of the Mx1-cre system. Injection of pIC at the pre-cancer stage robustly suppressed liver tumorigenesis either induced by chemical carcinogens or by Pten loss and associated hepatosteatosis. The immunostimulatory dsRNA inhibited liver cancer initiation, apparently by boosting multiple anti-tumor activities of innate immunity, including induction of immunoregulatory cytokines, activation of NK cells and dendritic cells, and reprogramming of macrophage polarization. This study paves the way for the development of preventive and early interfering strategies for liver cancer to reduce the rapidly increasing incidences of liver cancer in an ever-growing population with chronic liver disorders.

Abstract: The epithelium of the gastric mucosa and its glands in the corpus of rat stomach contains mucous surface cells (MSCs), parietal cells, mucous neck cells (MNCs), zymogenic or chief cells (ZCs), several types of enteroendocrine cells, and intermediate cells with characteristics between MNCs and ZCs also called transitional or prezymogenic cells (pre-ZCs). The aim of our work was to analyze the expression of Mannose (Man) in the rat gastric glands by means of Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA) histochemistry to identify the differences between MNC, pre-ZCs and ZCs and to establish the relationships between these cells. Most of the cytoplasm of MNCs was negative for GNA histochemistry. Intensity of GNA labeling in the gastric gland showed a graduation from pre-ZCs (weak labeling) to ZCs (moderate labeling). Labeling of ZCs was stronger at the perinuclear and apical cytoplasm. In the last years, strong evidence has been reported supporting that ZCs differentiate from MNCs. Our work also supports the origin of ZCs from MNCs, because the GNA labeling graduation might be due to oligosaccharides which are not expressed in MNCs, start to express in pre-ZCs and are more abundant in ZCs, indicating that differentiation from MNCs to ZCs is a process in which glycans with Man moieties are synthesized.

Abstract: Summary
Latent replication-competent HIV-1 persists in individuals on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed the Full-Length Individual Proviral Sequencing (FLIPS) assay to determine the distribution of latent replication-competent HIV-1 within memory CD4+ T cell subsets in six individuals on long-term ART. FLIPS is an efficient, high-throughput assay that amplifies and sequences near full-length (∼9 kb) HIV-1 proviral genomes and determines potential replication competency through genetic characterization. FLIPS provides a genome-scale perspective that addresses the limitations of other methods that also genetically characterize the latent reservoir. Using FLIPS, we identified 5% of proviruses as intact and potentially replication competent. Intact proviruses were unequally distributed between T cell subsets, with effector memory cells containing the largest proportion of genetically intact HIV-1 proviruses. We identified multiple identical intact proviruses, suggesting a role for cellular proliferation in the maintenance of the latent HIV-1 reservoir.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb-repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 play a key role in chromosome silencing induced by the non-coding RNA Xist. Polycomb recruitment is initiated by the PCGF3/5-PRC1 complex, which catalyzes chromosome-wide H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation, signaling recruitment of other PRC1 complexes, and PRC2. However, the molecular mechanism for PCGF3/5-PRC1 recruitment by Xist RNA is not understood. Here we define the Xist RNA Polycomb Interaction Domain (XR-PID), a 600 nt sequence encompassing the Xist B-repeat element. Deletion of XR-PID abolishes Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment, in turn abrogating Xist-mediated gene silencing and reversing Xist-induced chromatin inaccessibility. We identify the RNA-binding protein hnRNPK as the principal XR-PID binding factor required to recruit PCGF3/5-PRC1. Accordingly, synthetically tethering hnRNPK to Xist RNA lacking XR-PID is sufficient for Xist-dependent Polycomb recruitment. Our findings define a key pathway for Polycomb recruitment by Xist RNA, providing important insights into mechanisms of chromatin modification by non-coding RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Vision influences behavior, but ongoing behavior also modulates vision in animals ranging from insects to primates. The function and biophysical mechanisms of most such modulations remain unresolved. Here, we combine behavioral genetics, electrophysiology, and high-speed videography to advance a function for behavioral modulations of visual processing in Drosophila. We argue that a set of motion-sensitive visual neurons regulate gaze-stabilizing head movements. We describe how, during flight turns, Drosophila perform a set of head movements that require silencing their gaze-stability reflexes along the primary rotation axis of the turn. Consistent with this behavioral requirement, we find pervasive motor-related inputs to the visual neurons, which quantitatively silence their predicted visual responses to rotations around the relevant axis while preserving sensitivity around other axes. This work proposes a function for a behavioral modulation of visual processing and illustrates how the brain can remove one sensory signal from a circuit carrying multiple related signals.

Abstract: Summary
Replication fork integrity is challenged in conditions of stress and protected by the Mec1/ATR checkpoint to preserve genome stability. Still poorly understood in fork protection is the role played by the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) cohesin complex. We uncovered a role for the Rsp5Bul2 ubiquitin ligase in promoting survival to replication stress by preserving stalled fork integrity. Rsp5Bul2 physically interacts with cohesin and the Mec1 kinase, thus promoting checkpoint-dependent cohesin ubiquitylation and cohesin-mediated fork protection. Ubiquitylation mediated by Rsp5Bul2 promotes cohesin mobilization from chromatin neighboring stalled forks, likely by stimulating the Cdc48/p97 ubiquitin-selective segregase, and its timely association to nascent chromatids. This Rsp5Bul2 fork protection mechanism requires the Wpl1 cohesin mobilizer as well as the function of the Eco1 acetyltransferase securing sister chromatid entrapment. Our data indicate that ubiquitylation facilitates cohesin dynamic interfacing with replication forks within a mechanism preserving stalled-fork functional architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Cockayne syndrome (CS) is caused by mutations in CSA and CSB. The CSA and CSB proteins have been linked to both promoting transcription-coupled repair and restoring transcription following DNA damage. We show that UV stress arrests transcription of approximately 70% of genes in CSA- or CSB-deficient cells due to the constitutive presence of ATF3 at CRE/ATF sites. We found that CSB, CSA/DDB1/CUL4A, and MDM2 were essential for ATF3 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. ATF3 removal was concomitant with the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the restart of transcription. Preventing ATF3 ubiquitination by mutating target lysines prevented recovery of transcription and increased cell death following UV treatment. Our data suggest that the coordinate action of CSA and CSB, as part of the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery, regulates the recruitment timing of DNA-binding factors and provide explanations about the mechanism of transcription arrest following genotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
The attenuation of ancestral pro-regenerative pathways may explain why humans do not efficiently regenerate damaged organs. Vertebrate lineages that exhibit robust regeneration, including the teleost zebrafish, provide insights into the maintenance of adult regenerative capacity. Using established models of spinal cord, heart, and retina regeneration, we discovered that zebrafish Treg-like (zTreg) cells rapidly homed to damaged organs. Conditional ablation of zTreg cells blocked organ regeneration by impairing precursor cell proliferation. In addition to modulating inflammation, infiltrating zTreg cells stimulated regeneration through interleukin-10-independent secretion of organ-specific regenerative factors (Ntf3: spinal cord; Nrg1: heart; Igf1: retina). Recombinant regeneration factors rescued the regeneration defects associated with zTreg cell depletion, whereas Foxp3a-deficient zTreg cells infiltrated damaged organs but failed to express regenerative factors. Our data delineate organ-specific roles for Treg cells in maintaining pro-regenerative capacity that could potentially be harnessed for diverse regenerative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
One potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is to use antibodies that bind to small soluble protein aggregates to reduce their toxic effects. However, these therapies are rarely tested in human CSF before clinical trials because of the lack of sensitive methods that enable the measurement of aggregate-induced toxicity at low concentrations. We have developed highly sensitive single vesicle and single-cell-based assays that detect the Ca2+ influx caused by the CSF of individuals affected with AD and healthy controls, and we have found comparable effects for both types of samples. We also show that an extracellular chaperone clusterin; a nanobody specific to the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ); and bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody raised against Aβ, could all reduce the Ca2+ influx caused by synthetic Aβ oligomers but are less effective in CSF. These assays could be used to characterize potential therapeutic agents in CSF before clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic cells, diverse stresses trigger coalescence of RNA-binding proteins into stress granules. In vitro, stress-granule-associated proteins can demix to form liquids, hydrogels, and other assemblies lacking fixed stoichiometry. Observing these phenomena has generally required conditions far removed from physiological stresses. We show that poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in vitro upon exposure to physiological stress conditions. Other RNA-binding proteins depend upon low-complexity regions (LCRs) or RNA for phase separation, whereas Pab1’s LCR is not required for demixing, and RNA inhibits it. Based on unique evolutionary patterns, we create LCR mutations, which systematically tune its biophysical properties and Pab1 phase separation in vitro and in vivo. Mutations that impede phase separation reduce organism fitness during prolonged stress. Poly(A)-binding protein thus acts as a physiological stress sensor, exploiting phase separation to precisely mark stress onset, a broadly generalizable mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
T and B cell compartmentalization is a hallmark of secondary lymphoid organs and is maintained by chemokine-expressing stromal cells. How this stromal cell network initially develops and differentiates into two distinct subsets is poorly known, especially for the splenic white pulp (WP). Here, we show that perivascular fibroblast precursors are triggered by LTα1β2 signals to expand, express CCL19/21, and then differentiate into two functionally distinct fibroblast subsets responsible for B and T cell clustering and WP compartmentalization. Failure to express or sense CCL19 leads to impaired T zone development, while lack of B cells or LTα1β2 leads to an earlier and stronger impairment in WP development. We therefore propose that WP development proceeds in multiple steps, with LTα1β2+ B cells acting as major inducer cells driving the expansion and gradual differentiation of perivascular fibroblasts into T and B zone organizer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Delivery of neurotrophins and neuropeptides via long-range trafficking of dense core vesicles (DCVs) from the cell soma to nerve terminals is essential for synapse modulation and circuit function. But the mechanism by which transiting DCVs are captured at specific sites is unknown. Here, we discovered that Synaptotagmin-4 (Syt4) regulates the capture and spatial distribution of DCVs in hippocampal neurons. We found that DCVs are highly mobile and undergo long-range translocation but switch directions only at the distal ends of axons, revealing a circular trafficking pattern. Phosphorylation of serine 135 of Syt4 by JNK steers DCV trafficking by destabilizing Syt4-Kif1A interaction, leading to a transition from microtubule-dependent DCV trafficking to capture at en passant presynaptic boutons by actin. Furthermore, neuronal activity increased DCV capture via JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the S135 site of Syt4. Our data reveal a mechanism that ensures rapid, site-specific delivery of DCVs to synapses.

Abstract: Summary
Human brain imaging studies have revealed the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region for mediating visceral-pain-cognitive interactions. Recently, we characterized impairments of long-term potentiation and spike-field coherence in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-ACC network in association with a decision-making deficit in rats with visceral hypersensitivity (VH). Now, by combining integrative neurobiological approaches, we show that ACC-reactive astrogliosis and activity-dependent impairment of lactate release occur in VH rats. Exogenous lactate supply rescues chronic-visceral-pain-caused impairments of ACC phase locking and decision making, which can be mimicked by optogenetic activation of ACC astrocytes. Large-scale electrophysiological recordings in free-moving animals during a decision-making task indicate that optogenetic astrocytic activation improves decision-making performance and engages ACC phase locking and BLA-to-ACC information flow. Collectively, these observations support the idea of an “astrocyte-neuron l-lactate shuttle” and suggest that targeting astrocytes may help with cognitive dysfunctions under chronic visceral pain.

Abstract: Summary
The brain regulates food intake by processing sensory cues and peripheral physiological signals, but the neural basis of this integration remains unclear. Hypothalamic, agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons are critical regulators of food intake. AgRP neuron activity is high during hunger and is rapidly reduced by the sight and smell of food. Here, we reveal two distinct components of AgRP neuron activity regulation: a rapid but transient sensory-driven signal and a slower, sustained calorie-dependent signal. We discovered that nutrients are necessary and sufficient for sustained reductions in AgRP neuron activity and that activity reductions are proportional to the calories obtained. This change in activity is recapitulated by exogenous administration of gut-derived satiation signals. Furthermore, we showed that the nutritive value of food trains sensory systems—in a single trial—to drive rapid, anticipatory AgRP neuron activity inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate that nutrients are the primary regulators of AgRP neuron activity.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the synthesis and screening of small-molecule libraries have accelerated the discovery of chemical probes for studying biological processes. Still, only a small fraction of the human proteome has chemical ligands. Here, we describe a platform that marries fragment-based ligand discovery with quantitative chemical proteomics to map thousands of reversible small molecule-protein interactions directly in human cells, many of which can be site-specifically determined. We show that fragment hits can be advanced to furnish selective ligands that affect the activity of proteins heretofore lacking chemical probes. We further combine fragment-based chemical proteomics with phenotypic screening to identify small molecules that promote adipocyte differentiation by engaging the poorly characterized membrane protein PGRMC2. Fragment-based screening in human cells thus provides an extensive proteome-wide map of protein ligandability and facilitates the coordinated discovery of bioactive small molecules and their molecular targets.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage triggers chromatin remodeling by mechanisms that are poorly understood. The oncogene and chromatin remodeler ALC1/CHD1L massively decompacts chromatin in vivo yet is inactive prior to DNA-damage-mediated PARP1 induction. We show that the interaction of the ALC1 macrodomain with the ATPase module mediates auto-inhibition. PARP1 activation suppresses this inhibitory interaction. Crucially, release from auto-inhibition requires a poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) binding macrodomain. We identify tri-ADP-ribose as a potent PAR-mimic and synthetic allosteric effector that abrogates ATPase-macrodomain interactions, promotes an ungated conformation, and activates the remodeler’s ATPase. ALC1 fragments lacking the regulatory macrodomain relax chromatin in vivo without requiring PARP1 activation. Further, the ATPase restricts the macrodomain’s interaction with PARP1 under non-DNA damage conditions. Somatic cancer mutants disrupt ALC1’s auto-inhibition and activate chromatin remodeling. Our data show that the NAD+-metabolite and nucleic acid PAR triggers ALC1 to drive chromatin relaxation. Modular allostery in this oncogene tightly controls its robust, DNA-damage-dependent activation.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining cell fate relies on robust mechanisms that prevent the differentiation of specified cells into other cell types. This is especially critical during embryogenesis, when extensive cell proliferation, patterning, and migration events take place. Here we show that vertebrate primordial germ cells (PGCs) are protected from reprogramming into other cell types by the RNA-binding protein Dead end (Dnd). PGCs knocked down for Dnd lose their characteristic morphology and adopt various somatic cell fates. Concomitantly, they gain a gene expression profile reflecting differentiation into cells of different germ layers, in a process that we could direct by expression of specific cell-fate determinants. Importantly, we visualized these events within live zebrafish embryos, which provide temporal information regarding cell reprogramming. Our results shed light on the mechanisms controlling germ cell fate maintenance and are relevant for the formation of teratoma, a tumor class composed of cells from more than one germ layer.

Abstract: As a component of the neurovascular unit, cerebral smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) are an important mediator in the development of cerebral vascular diseases such as stroke. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are the products of arachidonic acid catalyzed by cytochrome P450 epoxygenase. EETs are shown to exert neuroprotective effects. In this article, the role of EET in the growth and apoptosis of CSMCs and the underlying mechanisms under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions were addressed. The viability of CMSCs was decreased significantly in the OGD group, while different subtypes of EETs, especially 14,15-EET, could increase the viability of CSMCs under OGD conditions. RAPA (serine/threonine kinase Mammalian Target of Rapamycin), a specific mTOR inhibitor, could elevate the level of oxygen free radicals in CSMCs as well as the anti-apoptotic effects of 14,15-EET under OGD conditions. However, SP600125, a specific JNK (c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase) pathway inhibitor, could attenuate oxygen free radicals levels in CSMCs as well as the anti-apoptotic effects of 14,15-EET under OGD conditions. These results strongly suggest that EETs exert protective functions during the growth and apoptosis of CSMCs, via the JNK/c-Jun and mTOR signaling pathways in vitro. We are the first to disclose the beneficial roles and underlying mechanism of 14,15-EET in CSMC under OGD conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) derive from embryonic precursors, but little is known about how or when this occurs. We have addressed this issue using single-cell RNA sequencing at multiple developmental time points to analyze the embryonic murine cortex, one source of adult forebrain NSCs. We computationally identify all major cortical cell types, including the embryonic radial precursors (RPs) that generate adult NSCs. We define the initial emergence of RPs from neuroepithelial stem cells at E11.5. We show that, by E13.5, RPs express a transcriptional identity that is maintained and reinforced throughout their transition to a non-proliferative state between E15.5 and E17.5. These slowly proliferating late embryonic RPs share a core transcriptional phenotype with quiescent adult forebrain NSCs. Together, these findings support a model wherein cortical RPs maintain a core transcriptional identity from embryogenesis through to adulthood and wherein the transition to a quiescent adult NSC occurs during late neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) contribute to all aspects of tumor progression. Use of CSF1R inhibitors to target TAM is therapeutically appealing, but has had very limited anti-tumor effects. Here, we have identified the mechanism that limited the effect of CSF1R targeted therapy. We demonstrated that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are major sources of chemokines that recruit granulocytes to tumors. CSF1 produced by tumor cells caused HDAC2-mediated downregulation of granulocyte-specific chemokine expression in CAF, which limited migration of these cells to tumors. Treatment with CSF1R inhibitors disrupted this crosstalk and triggered a profound increase in granulocyte recruitment to tumors. Combining CSF1R inhibitor with a CXCR2 antagonist blocked granulocyte infiltration of tumors and showed strong anti-tumor effects.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent innate versions of T helper and cytotoxic T cells that differentiate from committed ILC precursors (ILCPs). How ILCPs give rise to mature tissue-resident ILCs remains unclear. Here, we identify circulating and tissue ILCPs in humans that fail to express the transcription factors and cytokine outputs of mature ILCs but have these signature loci in an epigenetically poised configuration. Human ILCPs robustly generate all ILC subsets in vitro and in vivo. While human ILCPs express low levels of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor C (RORC) transcripts, these cells are found in RORC-deficient patients and retain potential for EOMES+ natural killer (NK) cells, interferon gamma-positive (IFN-γ+) ILC1s, interleukin (IL)-13+ ILC2s, and for IL-22+, but not for IL-17A+ ILC3s. Our results support a model of tissue ILC differentiation (“ILC-poiesis”), whereby diverse ILC subsets are generated in situ from systemically distributed ILCPs in response to local environmental signals.

Abstract: Summary
Puberty is characterized by dynamic tissue remodeling in the mammary gland involving ductal elongation, resolution into the mature epithelial bilayer, and lumen formation. To decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying these processes, we studied the fate of putative stem cells, termed cap cells, present in terminal end buds of pubertal mice. Employing a p63CreERT2-based lineage-tracing strategy, we identified a unipotent fate for proliferative cap cells that only generated cells with basal features. Furthermore, we observed that dislocated “cap-in-body” cells underwent apoptosis, which aided lumen formation during ductal development. Basal lineage-specific profiling and genetic loss-of-function experiments revealed a critical role for FOXO transcription factors in mediating these proliferative versus apoptotic fates. Importantly, these studies revealed a mode of WNT signaling-mediated FOXO1 inhibition, potentially mediated through AKT. Together, these data suggest that the WNT pathway confers proliferative and survival advantages on cap cells via regulation of FOXO1 localization.

Abstract: Summary
Feeding requires the integration of homeostatic drives with emotional states relevant to food procurement in potentially hostile environments. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates feeding and anxiety, but how these are controlled in a concerted manner remains unclear. Using pharmacogenetic, optogenetic, and calcium imaging approaches with a battery of behavioral assays, we demonstrate that VMH steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons constitute a nutritionally sensitive switch, modulating the competing motivations of feeding and avoidance of potentially dangerous environments. Acute alteration of SF1 neuronal activity alters food intake via changes in appetite and feeding-related behaviors, including locomotion, exploration, anxiety, and valence. In turn, intrinsic SF1 neuron activity is low during feeding and increases with both feeding termination and stress. Our findings identify SF1 neurons as a key part of the neurocircuitry that controls both feeding and related affective states, giving potential insights into the relationship between disordered eating and stress-associated psychological disorders in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the immune compartment of tumors facilitates the development of revolutionary new therapies. We used a Kras(G12D)-driven mouse model of lung cancer to establish an immune signature and identified a contribution of Gr1+ neutrophils to disease progression. Depletion experiments showed that Gr1+ cells (1) favor tumor growth, (2) reduce T cell homing and prevent successful anti-PD1 immunotherapy, and (3) alter angiogenesis, leading to hypoxia and sustained Snail expression in lung cancer cells. In turn, Snail accelerated disease progression and increased intratumoral Cxcl2 secretion and neutrophil infiltration. Cxcl2 was produced mainly by neutrophils themselves in response to a factor secreted by Snail-expressing tumor cells. We therefore propose a vicious cycle encompassing neutrophils and Snail to maintain a deleterious tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
The central mechanism by which neurotensin (Nts) potentiates weight loss has remained elusive. We leveraged chemogenetics to reveal that Nts-expressing neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) promote weight loss in mice by increasing volitional activity and restraining food intake. Intriguingly, these dual weight loss behaviors are mediated by distinct signaling pathways: Nts action via NtsR1 is essential for the anorectic effect of the LHA Nts circuit, but not for regulation of locomotor or drinking behavior. Furthermore, although LHA Nts neurons cannot reduce intake of freely available obesogenic foods, they effectively restrain motivated feeding in hungry, weight-restricted animals. LHA Nts neurons are thus vital mediators of central Nts action, particularly in the face of negative energy balance. Enhanced action via LHA Nts neurons may, therefore, be useful to suppress the increased appetitive drive that occurs after lifestyle-mediated weight loss and, hence, to prevent weight regain.

Abstract: Summary
GADD34, a stress-induced regulatory subunit of the phosphatase PP1, is known to function in hyperosmotic stress through its well-known role in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Adaptation to hyperosmotic stress is important for the health of corneal epithelial cells exposed to changes in extracellular osmolarity, with maladaptation leading to dry eye syndrome. This adaptation includes induction of SNAT2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-processed protein, which helps to reverse the stress-induced loss of cell volume and promote homeostasis through amino acid uptake. Here, we show that GADD34 promotes the processing of proteins synthesized on the ER during hyperosmotic stress independent of its action in the ISR. We show that GADD34/PP1 phosphatase activity reverses hyperosmotic-stress-induced Golgi fragmentation and is important for cis- to trans-Golgi trafficking of SNAT2, thereby promoting SNAT2 plasma membrane localization and function. These results suggest that GADD34 is a protective molecule for ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
The local environment may affect the development and function of tissue-resident T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are crucial for controlling inflammation. Although the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), an environmental sensor, is expressed by Tregs, its role in Treg cell development and/or function remains elusive. Here, we generated mouse genetic models to ablate or activate Ahr expression specifically in Tregs. We showed that Ahr was expressed more abundantly by peripherally induced Tregs (pTregs) in the gut and that its expression was independent of microbiota. Ahr was important for Treg gut homing and function. Ahr inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by Tregs but was dispensable for Treg stability. Furthermore, Ahr-expressing Tregs had enhanced in vivo suppressive activity compared with Tregs lacking Ahr expression in a T cell transfer model of colitis. Our data suggest that Ahr signaling in Tregs may be important for gut immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of the endocytic machinery is a constitutively active process that is important for the organization of the plasma membrane, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking. Existing research has focused on the stochastic nature of endocytosis. Here, we report the emergence of the collective dynamics of endocytic proteins as periodic traveling waves on the cell surface. Coordinated clathrin assembly provides the earliest spatial cue for cortical waves and sets the direction of propagation. Surprisingly, the onset of clathrin waves, but not individual endocytic events, requires feedback from downstream factors, including FBP17, Cdc42, and N-WASP. In addition to the localized endocytic assembly at the plasma membrane, intracellular clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate predict the excitability of the plasma membrane and modulate the geometry of traveling waves. Collectively, our data demonstrate the multiplicity of clathrin functions in cortical pattern formation and provide important insights regarding the nucleation and propagation of single-cell patterns.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurring within fragile zones of less than 200 base pairs account for the formation of the most common human chromosomal translocations in lymphoid malignancies, yet the mechanism of how breaks occur remains unknown. Here, we have transferred human fragile zones into S. cerevisiae in the context of a genetic assay to understand the mechanism leading to DSBs at these sites. Our findings indicate that a combination of factors is required to sensitize these regions. Foremost, DNA strand separation by transcription or increased torsional stress can expose these DNA regions to damage from either the expression of human AID or increased oxidative stress. This damage causes DNA lesions that, if not repaired quickly, are prone to nuclease cleavage, resulting in DSBs. Our results provide mechanistic insight into why human neoplastic translocation fragile DNA sequences are more prone to enzymes or agents that cause longer-lived DNA lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages (phages) typically exhibit a narrow host range, yet they tremendously impact horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we investigate phage dynamics in communities harboring phage-resistant (R) and sensitive (S) bacteria, a common scenario in nature. Using Bacillus subtilis and its lytic phage SPP1, we demonstrate that R cells, lacking SPP1 receptor, can be lysed by SPP1 when co-cultured with S cells. This unanticipated lysis was triggered in part by phage lytic enzymes released from nearby infected cells. Strikingly, we discovered that occasionally phages can invade R cells, a phenomenon we termed acquisition of sensitivity (ASEN). We found that ASEN is mediated by R cells transiently gaining phage attachment molecules from neighboring S cells and provide evidence that this molecular exchange is driven by membrane vesicles. Exchange of phage attachment molecules could even occur in an interspecies fashion, enabling phage adsorption to non-host species, providing an unexplored route for HGT.

Abstract: Cancer as a multistep and complicated disease is regulated by several molecular and cellular events. Cancer treatment could be managed at the early stages when the tumor is confined in the tissue. However, disseminated cancer cells metastasize to other body parts and generate new tumors resulting in mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found in different body parts and helps adult tissue regeneration. The role of MSCs in cancer progression has emerged as one of the important aspects in cancer biology and is the aim of interest in recent years. In the current study, effects of Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) on PC-3 prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration were conducted by cell proliferation, apoptosis, gene expression and cell migration analysis in vitro. Condition medium (CM) obtained from DPSCs increased cell proliferation of PC-3 cells and decreased apoptosis. Either administration of CM or trans well co-culture of DPSCs increased cell migration in scratch assay, confirmed by gene expression analysis of migratory genes including fibronectin, laminin and collagen type I (Col I). Furthermore, DPSCs participated in a self-organized structure with PC-3 cells in co-culture conditions. Overall, results indicated that DPSCs could promote PC-3 cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in co-culture conditions in vitro.

Abstract: Background
Diabetes mellitus represents one of the disorders in the metabolism that affects all body systems including CNS. Cerebrolysin contains many neurotrophic factors, and many studies reported that it can be used treatment of many neurological disorders.
Aim of the work
The aim of the current study was to study the potential neuroprotective effect of cerebrolysin on the cerebellum of diabetic rat.
Materials and methods
Sprague Dawley male rats were divided randomly into four groups: control, cerebrolysin (Cbl), diabetes and diabetes treated with Cbl groups. Induction of diabetes was performed by intraperitoneal injection of 60mg/kg streptozotocin once. Eight weeks later, the rats were anaesthetized, sacrificed and the cerebellum was removed. Cerebellum oxidative stress markers were analysis. Cerebellar tissue was subjected to histolopathological examination and immune-histological assessment of GFAP and Synaptophysin.
Results
As compared to the control group, diabetes caused degenerative changes in the cerebellum with significant elevation of MDA and decrease of SOD levels and gliosis confirmed by increase the GFAP expression area fraction. Diabetes increased significantly the optical density of synaptophysin expression with increase in its area fraction in the granular layer. Although Cbl treatment succeeded in minimizing the changes in the oxidative stress markers, it had no effect on pathological changes of the diabetic cerebellum. Cerebrolysin treatment of diabetic rats decreased the area fraction of GFAP positive immunoreactivity and had no effect on synaptophysin expression.
Conclusion
Cerebrolysin can potentially protect against diabetes induced changes in the cerebellum through minimizing the oxidative stress and improving the gliosis.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer arising from sympatho-adrenal neural crest cells. Disseminated forms have high frequency of multiple tumoral foci whose etiology remains unknown; NB embryonic origin limits investigations in patients and current models. We developed an avian embryonic model driving human NB tumorigenesis in tissues homologous to patients. We found that aggressive NBs display a metastatic mode, secondary dissemination via peripheral nerves and aorta. Through tumor transcriptional profiling, we found that NB dissemination is induced by the shutdown of a pro-cohesion autocrine signal, SEMA3C, which constrains the tumoral mass. Lowering SEMA3C levels shifts the balance toward detachment, triggering NB cells to collectively evade the tumor. Together with patient cohort analysis, this identifies a microenvironment-driven pro-metastatic switch for NB.

Abstract: Summary
R-loop, a three-stranded RNA/DNA structure, has been linked to induced genome instability and regulated gene expression. To enable precision analysis of R-loops in vivo, we develop an RNase-H-based approach; this reveals predominant R-loop formation near gene promoters with strong G/C skew and propensity to form G-quadruplex in non-template DNA, corroborating with all biochemically established properties of R-loops. Transcription perturbation experiments further indicate that R-loop induction correlates to transcriptional pausing. Interestingly, we note that most mapped R-loops are each linked to a nearby free RNA end; by using a ribozyme to co-transcriptionally cleave nascent RNA, we demonstrate that such a free RNA end coupled with a G/C-skewed sequence is necessary and sufficient to induce R-loop. These findings provide a topological solution for RNA invasion into duplex DNA and suggest an order for R-loop initiation and elongation in an opposite direction to that previously proposed.

Abstract: Summary
Contradicting observations have been made regarding the relative contributions of immune sensors to shaping the microbiome, yet the reasons for these discrepancies are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of environmental factors in shaping the microbiome in mice deficient in adaptive immunity (Rag2−/−) and Nlrp6, an immune sensor proposed to be involved in regulation of microbiota composition. In conventionally housed Nlrp6−/− mice, familial transmission has a significant effect on microbiota composition, complicating the analysis of genotype-dependent effects. Notably, after rederivation into standardized specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions devoid of pathobionts, microbiota composition was indistinguishable between WT, Rag2−/−, and Nlrp6−/− mice. However, upon reintroduction of a pathobiont-containing community host, genotype-dependent differences reappear, specifically affecting the relative abundance of pathobionts such as Helicobacter spp. Our results show that the impact of Nlrp6 and also of adaptive immunity on microbiota composition depends on community structure and primarily influences pathobionts but not commensals.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy and autophagy-related genes (Atg) have been attributed prominent roles in tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles called exosomes are also implicated in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that exosome production is strongly reduced in cells lacking Atg5 and Atg16L1, but this is independent of Atg7 and canonical autophagy. Atg5 specifically decreases acidification of late endosomes where exosomes are produced, disrupting the acidifying V1V0-ATPase by removing a regulatory component, ATP6V1E1, into exosomes. The effect of Atg5 on exosome production promotes the migration and in vivo metastasis of orthotopic breast cancer cells. These findings uncover mechanisms controlling exosome release and identify means by which autophagy-related genes can contribute to metastasis in autophagy-independent pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs have emerged as a new class of mobile signals. Here, we investigate their mechanism of action and show that mobile small RNAs generate sharply defined domains of target gene expression through an intrinsic and direct threshold-based readout of their mobility gradients. This readout is highly sensitive to small RNA levels at the source, allowing plasticity in the positioning of a target gene expression boundary. Besides patterning their immediate targets, the readouts of opposing small RNA gradients enable specification of robust, uniformly positioned developmental boundaries. These patterning properties of small RNAs are reminiscent of those of animal morphogens. However, their mode of action and the intrinsic nature of their gradients distinguish mobile small RNAs from classical morphogens and present a unique direct mechanism through which to relay positional information. Mobile small RNAs and their targets thus emerge as highly portable, evolutionarily tractable regulatory modules through which to create pattern.

Abstract: Summary
Sexual preference for the opposite sex is a fundamental behavior underlying reproductive success, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined the role of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) in governing chemosensory-mediated preference for females in TrpC2−/− and wild-type male mice. TrpC2−/− males, deficient in VNO-mediated signaling, do not display mating or olfactory preference toward females. We found that, during social interaction with females, TrpC2−/− males do not show increased NAcc dopamine levels, observed in wild-type males. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA-NAcc dopaminergic neurons in TrpC2−/− males during exposure to a female promoted preference response to female pheromones and elevated copulatory behavior toward females. Additionally, we found that signaling through the D1 receptor in the NAcc is necessary for the olfactory preference for female-soiled bedding. Our study establishes a critical role for the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in governing pheromone-mediated responses and mate choice in male mice.

Abstract: Summary
Activity-dependent synthesis of plasticity-related proteins is necessary to sustain long-lasting synaptic modifications and consolidate memory. We investigated the role of the translational regulator cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2) in learning and memory because regulated mRNA translation contributes to synaptic plasticity. Forebrain-restricted CPEB2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibited impaired hippocampus-dependent memory in contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze tests. CPEB2 cKO hippocampi showed impaired long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. Reduced surface, but not total, expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in CPEB2 KO neurons led us to identify that CPEB2 enhanced the translation of GRASP1 mRNA to facilitate recycling and maintain the surface level of AMPARs. Ectopic expression of CPEB2 or GRASP1 in CA1 areas of CPEB2 cKO mouse hippocampi rescued long-term potentiation and spatial memory in a water maze test. Thus, CPEB2-regulated GRASP1 mRNA translation is pivotal for AMPAR recycling, long-term plasticity, and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Condensins load onto DNA to organize chromosomes. Smc-ScpAB clearly loads onto the parS sites bound by Spo0J, but other loading site(s) must operate independently of parS. In this study, we asked where and how Smc-ScpAB normally selects its loading site. Our results suggest that rDNA is also a loading site. A pull-down assay revealed that Smc-ScpAB preferentially loads onto rDNA in the wild-type cell and even in a Δspo0J mutant but not in a Δsmc mutant. Moreover, we showed that deletion mutants of rDNAs cause a defect in nucleoid separation, and at least two rDNAs near oriC are essential for separation. Full-length rDNA, including promoters, is required for loading and nucleoid separation. A synthetic defect by deletions of both rDNA and spo0J resulted in more aberrant nucleoid separation. We propose that a single-stranded segment of DNA that is exposed at highly transcribed rRNA operons would become a target for Smc-ScpAB loading.

Abstract: Summary
Naturally stalled replication forks are considered to cause structurally abnormal chromosomes in tumor cells. However, underlying mechanisms remain speculative, as capturing naturally stalled forks has been a challenge. Here, we captured naturally stalled forks in tumor cells and delineated molecular processes underlying the structural evolution of circular mini-chromosomes (double-minute chromosomes; DMs). Replication forks stalled on the DM by the co-directional collision with the transcription machinery for long non-coding RNA. RPA, BRCA2, and DNA polymerase eta (Polη) were recruited to the stalled forks. The recruitment of Polη was critical for replication to continue, as Polη knockdown resulted in DM loss. Rescued stalled forks were error-prone and switched replication templates repeatedly to create complex fusions of multiple short genomic segments. In mice, such complex fusions circularized the genomic region surrounding MYC to create a DM during tumorigenesis. Our results define a molecular path that guides stalled replication forks to complex chromosomal rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
Direct cell programming via overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) aims to control cell fate with the degree of precision needed for clinical applications. However, the regulatory steps involved in successful terminal cell fate programming remain obscure. We have investigated the underlying mechanisms by looking at gene expression, chromatin states, and TF binding during the uniquely efficient Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 motor neuron programming pathway. Our analysis reveals a highly dynamic process in which Ngn2 and the Isl1/Lhx3 pair initially engage distinct regulatory regions. Subsequently, Isl1/Lhx3 binding shifts from one set of targets to another, controlling regulatory region activity and gene expression as cell differentiation progresses. Binding of Isl1/Lhx3 to later motor neuron enhancers depends on the Ebf and Onecut TFs, which are induced by Ngn2 during the programming process. Thus, motor neuron programming is the product of two initially independent transcriptional modules that converge with a feedforward transcriptional logic.

Abstract: Summary
A wide range of Ca2+-mediated functions are enabled by the dynamic properties of Ca2+, all of which are dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a scaffold protein that is involved in the function of intracellular organelles and is linked to cognitive and emotional deficits. Here, we demonstrate that DISC1 localizes to the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM). At the MAM, DISC1 interacts with IP3R1 and downregulates its ligand binding, modulating ER-mitochondria Ca2+ transfer through the MAM. The disrupted regulation of Ca2+ transfer caused by DISC1 dysfunction leads to abnormal Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria following oxidative stress, which impairs mitochondrial functions. DISC1 dysfunction alters corticosterone-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. Together, these findings link stress-associated neural stimuli with intracellular ER-mitochondria Ca2+ crosstalk via DISC1, providing mechanistic insight into how environmental risk factors can be interpreted by intracellular pathways under the control of genetic components in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) can exert their functions through multiple suppressive mechanisms; however, it is unclear how Tregs exactly employ these mechanisms. In this study, we found that interleukin-35 (IL-35)-producing Tregs were a distinct effector population from the IL-10-producing subset. We also revealed that these two subsets of effector Tregs have different transcription factor dependency. Terminal differentiation regulator Blimp1 was only critical for IL-10 production, but not for IL-35; Foxp3 was essential for IL-35 but dispensable for IL-10 production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IL-35-producing and IL-10-producing Tregs have a different activation status, do not share the same geographic locations in secondary lymphoid organs, and work in a complementary way to prevent autoimmunity. Thus, our study highlights the importance of effector Treg generation. We also provide evidence of Treg activation status tuning the generation of distinct effector Treg subsets, which work cooperatively to maintain immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
TP53 missense mutations significantly influence the development and progression of various human cancers via their gain of new functions (GOF) through different mechanisms. Here we report a unique mechanism underlying the GOF of p53-R249S (p53-RS), a p53 mutant frequently detected in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is highly related to hepatitis B infection and aflatoxin B1. A CDK inhibitor blocks p53-RS’s nuclear translocation in HCC, whereas CDK4 interacts with p53-RS in the G1/S phase of the cells, phosphorylates it, and enhances its nuclear localization. This is coupled with binding of a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) to p53-RS, but not the p53 form with mutations of four serines/threonines previously shown to be crucial for PIN1 binding. As a result, p53-RS interacts with c-Myc and enhances c-Myc-dependent rDNA transcription key for ribosomal biogenesis. These results unveil a CDK4-PIN1-p53-RS-c-Myc pathway as a novel mechanism for the GOF of p53-RS in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Immune responses involve coordination across cell types and tissues. However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection.

Abstract: Summary
The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays a central role in diverse cellular processes. GSK3 has two mammalian isozymes, GSK3α and GSK3β, whose functions remain ill-defined because of a lack of inhibitors that can distinguish between the two highly homologous isozymes. Here, we show that GSK3α and GSK3β can be selectively inhibited in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using a chemical-genetic approach. Selective inhibition of GSK3β is sufficient to maintain mouse ESC self-renewal, whereas GSK3α inhibition promotes mouse ESC differentiation toward neural lineages. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis reveals that GSK3α and GSK3β have distinct sets of downstream targets. Furthermore, selective inhibition of individual GSK3 isozymes yields distinct phenotypes from gene deletion, highlighting the power of the chemical-genetic approach in dissecting kinase catalytic functions from the protein’s scaffolding functions. Our study opens new avenues for defining GSK3 isozyme-specific functions in various cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
Uncontrolled microglial activation may lead to the development of inflammation-induced brain damage. Here, we uncover a ribosome-based mechanism/checkpoint involved in control of the innate immune response and microglial activation. Using an in vivo model system for analysis of the dynamic translational state of microglial ribosomes, with mRNAs as input and newly synthesized peptides as an output, we find a marked dissociation of microglia mRNA and protein networks following innate immune challenge. Highly upregulated and ribosome-associated mRNAs were not translated, resulting in two distinct microglial molecular signatures, a highly specialized pro-inflammatory mRNA signature and an immunomodulatory/homeostatic protein signature. We find that this is due to specific translational suppression of highly expressed mRNAs through a 3′ UTR-mediated mechanism involving the RNA-binding protein SRSF3. This discovery suggests avenues for therapeutic modulation of innate immune response in resident microglia.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of the host plant is a prerequisite for infection by pathogenic bacteria. However, how bacterial cells sense plant-derived stimuli, especially chemicals that function in regulating plant development, remains completely unknown. Here, we have identified a membrane-bound histidine kinase of the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, PcrK, as a bacterial receptor that specifically detects the plant cytokinin 2-isopentenyladenine (2iP). 2iP binds to the extracytoplasmic region of PcrK to decrease its autokinase activity. Through a four-step phosphorelay, 2iP stimulation decreased the phosphorylation level of PcrR, the cognate response regulator of PcrK, to activate the phosphodiesterase activity of PcrR in degrading the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid. 2iP perception by the PcrK-PcrR remarkably improves bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress by regulating the transcription of 56 genes, including the virulence-associated TonB-dependent receptor gene ctrA. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved, inter-kingdom signaling by which phytopathogenic bacteria intercept a plant hormone signal to promote adaptation to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Lgr5+ adult intestinal stem cells are highly proliferative throughout life. Single Lgr5+ stem cells can be cultured into three-dimensional organoids containing all intestinal epithelial cell types at near-normal ratios. Conditions to generate the main cell types (enterocyte, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M cells) are well established, but signals to induce the spectrum of hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here, we induce Lgr5+ stem cell quiescence in vitro by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in organoids and show that their quiescent state is readily reverted. Quiescent Lgr5+ stem cells acquire a distinct molecular signature biased toward EEC differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch, and MAPK pathways efficiently generates a diversity of EEC hormone-expressing subtypes in vitro. Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent proliferation and provide an approach for the study of the elusive EECs in a defined environment.

Abstract: Summary
The sole nonredundant role of the thymic medulla is to induce central tolerance, a vital process that depends on promiscuous gene expression (pGE), a unique feature of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Although pGE enhances transcription of >3,000 genes in mTECs, its impact on the regulation of protein homeostasis remains unexplored. Here, we report that, because of pGE, mature mTECs synthesize substantially more proteins than other cell types and are exquisitely sensitive to loss of immunoproteasomes (IPs). Indeed, IP deficiency causes proteotoxic stress in mTECs and leads to exhaustion of postnatal mTEC progenitors. Moreover, IP-deficient mice show accelerated thymic involution, which is characterized by a selective loss of mTECs and multiorgan autoimmune manifestations. We conclude that pGE, the quintessential feature of mTECs, is a major burden for the maintenance of proteostasis, which is alleviated by the constitutive expression of IPs in mTECs.

Abstract: Summary
The oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is a signature biomarker in various cancers, where it accumulates as a result of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). The metabolic source of 2-HG, in a wide variety of cancers, dictates both its generation and also potential therapeutic strategies, but this remains difficult to access in vivo. Here, utilizing patient-derived chondrosarcoma cells harboring endogenous mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, we report that 2-HG can be rapidly generated from glutamine in vitro. Then, using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI), we demonstrate that in vivo HP [1-13C] glutamine can be used to non-invasively measure glutamine-derived HP 2-HG production. This can be readily modulated utilizing a selective IDH1 inhibitor, opening the door to targeting glutamine-derived 2-HG therapeutically. Rapid rates of HP 2-HG generation in vivo further demonstrate that, in a context-dependent manner, glutamine can be a primary carbon source for 2-HG production in mutant IDH tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Sexual reproduction is almost universal in eukaryotic life and involves the fusion of male and female haploid gametes into a diploid cell. The sperm-restricted single-pass transmembrane protein HAP2-GCS1 has been postulated to function in membrane merger. Its presence in the major eukaryotic taxa—animals, plants, and protists (including important human pathogens like Plasmodium)—suggests that many eukaryotic organisms share a common gamete fusion mechanism. Here, we report combined bioinformatic, biochemical, mutational, and X-ray crystallographic studies on the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii HAP2 that reveal homology to class II viral membrane fusion proteins. We further show that targeting the segment corresponding to the fusion loop by mutagenesis or by antibodies blocks gamete fusion. These results demonstrate that HAP2 is the gamete fusogen and suggest a mechanism of action akin to viral fusion, indicating a way to block Plasmodium transmission and highlighting the impact of virus-cell genetic exchanges on the evolution of eukaryotic life.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism is an emerging stem cell hallmark tied to cell fate, pluripotency, and self-renewal, yet systems-level understanding of stem cell metabolism has been limited by the lack of genome-scale network models. Here, we develop a systems approach to integrate time-course metabolomics data with a computational model of metabolism to analyze the metabolic state of naive and primed murine pluripotent stem cells. Using this approach, we find that one-carbon metabolism involving phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, folate synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis is a key pathway that differs between the two states, resulting in differential sensitivity to anti-folates. The model also predicts that the pluripotency factor Lin28 regulates this one-carbon metabolic pathway, which we validate using metabolomics data from Lin28-deficient cells. Moreover, we identify and validate metabolic reactions related to S-adenosyl-methionine production that can differentially impact histone methylation in naive and primed cells. Our network-based approach provides a framework for characterizing metabolic changes influencing pluripotency and cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Nascent polypeptides can modulate the polypeptide elongation speed on the ribosome. Here, we show that nascent chains can even destabilize the translating Escherichia coli ribosome from within. This phenomenon, termed intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD), occurs in response to a special amino acid sequence of the nascent chain, without involving the release or the recycling factors. Typically, a consecutive array of acidic residues and those intermitted by alternating prolines induce IRD. The ribosomal protein bL31, which bridges the two subunits, counteracts IRD, such that only strong destabilizing sequences abort translation in living cells. We found that MgtL, the leader peptide of a Mg2+ transporter (MgtA), contains a translation-aborting sequence, which sensitizes the ribosome to a decline in Mg2+ concentration and thereby triggers the MgtA-upregulating genetic scheme. Translation proceeds at an inherent risk of ribosomal destabilization, and nascent chain-ribosome complexes can function as a Mg2+ sensor by harnessing IRD.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have suggested that changes in extracellular ion concentrations initiate the transition from an activity state that characterizes sleep in cortical neurons to states that characterize wakefulness. However, because neuronal activity and extracellular ion concentrations are interdependent, isolating their unique roles during sleep-wake transitions is not possible in vivo. Here, we extend the Averaged-Neuron model and demonstrate that, although changes in extracellular ion concentrations occur concurrently, decreasing the conductance of calcium-dependent potassium channels initiates the transition from sleep to wakefulness. We find that sleep is governed by stable, self-sustained oscillations in neuronal firing patterns, whereas the quiet awake state and active awake state are both governed by irregular oscillations and chaotic dynamics; transitions between these separable awake states are prompted by ionic changes. Although waking is indicative of a shift from stable to chaotic neuronal firing patterns, we illustrate that the properties of chaotic dynamics ensure that the transition between states is smooth and robust to noise.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2-EZH2) methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and is required to maintain gene repression during development. Misregulation of PRC2 is linked to a range of neoplastic malignancies, which is believed to involve methylation of H3K27. However, the full spectrum of non-histone substrates of PRC2 that might also contribute to PRC2 function is not known. We characterized the target recognition specificity of the PRC2 active site and used the resultant data to screen for uncharacterized potential targets. The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription elongation factor, Elongin A (EloA), is methylated by PRC2 in vivo. Mutation of the methylated EloA residue decreased repression of a subset of PRC2 target genes as measured by both steady-state and nascent RNA levels and perturbed embryonic stem cell differentiation. We propose that PRC2 modulates transcription of a subset of low expression target genes in part via methylation of EloA.

Abstract: Summary
Sodium accumulates in the interstitium and promotes inflammation through poorly defined mechanisms. We describe a pathway by which sodium enters dendritic cells (DCs) through amiloride-sensitive channels including the alpha and gamma subunits of the epithelial sodium channel and the sodium hydrogen exchanger 1. This leads to calcium influx via the sodium calcium exchanger, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), phosphorylation of p47phox, and association of p47phox with gp91phox. The assembled NADPH oxidase produces superoxide with subsequent formation of immunogenic isolevuglandin (IsoLG)-protein adducts. DCs activated by excess sodium produce increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and promote T cell production of cytokines IL-17A and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). When adoptively transferred into naive mice, these DCs prime hypertension in response to a sub-pressor dose of angiotensin II. These findings provide a mechanistic link between salt, inflammation, and hypertension involving increased oxidative stress and IsoLG production in DCs.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of irreparable cellular damage restricts healthspan after acute stress or natural aging. Senescent cells are thought to impair tissue function, and their genetic clearance can delay features of aging. Identifying how senescent cells avoid apoptosis allows for the prospective design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether homeostasis can also be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivot in senescent cell viability. We designed a FOXO4 peptide that perturbs the FOXO4 interaction with p53. In senescent cells, this selectively causes p53 nuclear exclusion and cell-intrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions where it was well tolerated in vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralized doxorubicin-induced chemotoxicity. Moreover, it restored fitness, fur density, and renal function in both fast aging XpdTTD/TTD and naturally aged mice. Thus, therapeutic targeting of senescent cells is feasible under conditions where loss of health has already occurred, and in doing so tissue homeostasis can effectively be restored.

Abstract: Summary
Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secreted signaling protein that is implicated in cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and cancer. Outside of its role in lipid metabolism, ANGPTL4 signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we identify ANGPTL4 as a Wnt signaling antagonist that binds to syndecans and forms a ternary complex with the Wnt co-receptor Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). This protein complex is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes, leading to attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Angptl4 is expressed in the Spemann organizer of Xenopus embryos and acts as a Wnt antagonist to promote notochord formation and prevent muscle differentiation. This unexpected function of ANGPTL4 invites re-interpretation of its diverse physiological effects in light of Wnt signaling and may open therapeutic avenues for human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we present a large (n = 107,207) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of general cognitive ability (“g”), further enhanced by combining results with a large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic loci associated with general cognitive ability. Results showed significant enrichment for genes causing Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability phenotype. Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed that the implicated loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions (most strongly in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic correlations between cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including psychiatric disorders, several autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at first birth.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the consequences of the complete elimination of E2F regulation, we profiled the proteome of Drosophila dDP mutants that lack functional E2F/DP complexes. The results uncovered changes in the larval fat body, a differentiated tissue that grows via endocycles. We report an unexpected mechanism of E2F/DP action that promotes quiescence in this tissue. In the fat body, dE2F/dDP limits cell-cycle progression by suppressing DNA damage responses. Loss of dDP upregulates dATM, allowing cells to sense and repair DNA damage and increasing replication of loci that are normally under-replicated in wild-type tissues. Genetic experiments show that ectopic dATM is sufficient to promote DNA synthesis in wild-type fat body cells. Strikingly, reducing dATM levels in dDP-deficient fat bodies restores cell-cycle control, improves tissue morphology, and extends animal development. These results show that, in some cellular contexts, dE2F/dDP-dependent suppression of DNA damage signaling is key for cell-cycle control and needed for normal development.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in PARK6 (PINK1) and PARK2 (Parkin) are linked to rare familial cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in these genes result in pathological dysregulation of mitophagy, contributing to neurodegeneration. Here, we report that environmental factors causing a specific posttranslational modification on PINK1 can mimic these genetic mutations. We describe a molecular mechanism for impairment of mitophagy via formation of S-nitrosylated PINK1 (SNO-PINK1). Mitochondrial insults simulating age- or environmental-related stress lead to increased SNO-PINK1, inhibiting its kinase activity. SNO-PINK1 decreases Parkin translocation to mitochondrial membranes, disrupting mitophagy in cell lines and human-iPSC-derived neurons. We find levels of SNO-PINK1 in brains of α-synuclein transgenic PD mice similar to those in cell-based models, indicating the pathophysiological relevance of our findings. Importantly, SNO-PINK1-mediated deficits in mitophagy contribute to neuronal cell death. These results reveal a direct molecular link between nitrosative stress, SNO-PINK1 formation, and mitophagic dysfunction that contributes to the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
MYC proteins bind globally to active promoters and promote transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). To identify effector proteins that mediate this function, we performed mass spectrometry on N-MYC complexes in neuroblastoma cells. The analysis shows that N-MYC forms complexes with TFIIIC, TOP2A, and RAD21, a subunit of cohesin. N-MYC and TFIIIC bind to overlapping sites in thousands of Pol II promoters and intergenic regions. TFIIIC promotes association of RAD21 with N-MYC target sites and is required for N-MYC-dependent promoter escape and pause release of Pol II. Aurora-A competes with binding of TFIIIC and RAD21 to N-MYC in vitro and antagonizes association of TOP2A, TFIIIC, and RAD21 with N-MYC during S phase, blocking N-MYC-dependent release of Pol II from the promoter. Inhibition of Aurora-A in S phase restores RAD21 and TFIIIC binding to chromatin and partially restores N-MYC-dependent transcriptional elongation. We propose that complex formation with Aurora-A controls N-MYC function during the cell cycle.

Abstract: We report the biological functions of a zebrafish homologue of RING-finger protein 152 (rnf152) during embryogenesis. rnf152 was initially identified as a brain-enriched E3 ligase involved in early embryogenesis of zebrafish. Expression of rnf152 was ubiquitous in the brain at 24 hpf but restricted to the eyes, midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), and rhombomeres at 48 hpf. Knockdown of rnf152 in zebrafish embryos caused defects in the eyes, MHB, and rhombomeres (r1–7) at 24 hpf. These defects in rnf152-deficient embryos were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) using neuroD, deltaD, notch1a, and notch3 probes. NeuroD expression was abolished in the marginal zone, outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the eyes at 27 hpf. Furthermore, deltaD and notch1a expression was remarkably reduced in the ONL, INL, subpallium, tectum, cerebellum, and rhombomeres (r1–7) at 24 hpf, whereas notch3 expression was reduced in the tectum, cerebellum, and rhombomeres at 24 hpf. Finally, we confirmed that expression of Notch target genes, her4 and ascl1a, also decreased significantly in these areas at 24 hpf. Thus, we propose that Rnf152 is essential for development of the eyes, midbrain and hindbrain, and that Delta-Notch signaling is involved.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous carcinoma in which various tumor-suppressor genes are lost by mutation, deletion, or silencing. Here we report a tumor-suppressive mode of action for growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and an unusual mechanism of its inactivation in TNBC. GDF11 promotes an epithelial, anti-invasive phenotype in 3D triple-negative cultures and intraductal xenografts by sustaining expression of E-cadherin and inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2). Surprisingly, clinical TNBCs retain the GDF11 locus and expression of the protein itself. GDF11 bioactivity is instead lost because of deficiencies in its convertase, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), causing inactive GDF11 precursor to accumulate intracellularly. PCSK5 reconstitution mobilizes the latent TNBC reservoir of GDF11 in vitro and suppresses triple-negative mammary cancer metastasis to the lung of syngeneic hosts. Intracellular GDF11 retention adds to the concept of tumor-suppressor inactivation and reveals a cell-biological vulnerability for TNBCs lacking therapeutically actionable mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Angiogenesis inhibitors are important for cancer therapy, but clinically approved anti-angiogenic agents have shown only modest efficacy and can compromise wound healing. This necessitates the development of novel anti-angiogenesis therapies. Here, we show significantly increased EGFL6 expression in tumor versus wound or normal endothelial cells. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo studies with orthotopic and genetically engineered mouse models, we demonstrate the mechanisms by which EGFL6 stimulates tumor angiogenesis. In contrast to its antagonistic effects on tumor angiogenesis, EGFL6 blockage did not affect normal wound healing. These findings have significant implications for development of anti-angiogenesis therapies.
