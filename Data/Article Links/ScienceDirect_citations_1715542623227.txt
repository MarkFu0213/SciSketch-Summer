Abstract: Independent studies from our group and others have provided evidence that sphingolipids (SLs) influence the antimycotic susceptibility of Candida species. We analyzed the molecular SL signatures of drug-resistant clinical isolates of Candida auris, which have emerged as a global threat over the last decade. This included Indian hospital isolates of C. auris, which were either resistant to fluconazole (FLCR) or amphotericin B (AmBR) or both drugs. Relative to Candida glabrata and Candida albicans strains, these C. auris isolates were susceptible to SL pathway inhibitors such as myriocin and aureobasidin A, suggesting that SL content may influence azole and AmB susceptibilities. Our analysis of SLs confirmed the presence of 140 SL species within nine major SL classes, namely the sphingoid bases, Cer, αOH-Cer, dhCer, PCer, αOH-PCer, αOH-GlcCer, GlcCer, and IPC. Other than for αOH-GlcCer, most of the SLs were found at higher concentrations in FLCR isolates as compared to the AmBR isolates. SLs were at intermediate levels in FLCR + AmBR isolates. The observed diversity of molecular species of SL classes based on fatty acyl composition was further reflected in their distinct specific imprint, suggesting their influence in drug resistance. Together, the presented data improves our understanding of the dynamics of SL structures, their synthesis, and link to the drug resistance in C. auris.

Abstract: We studied the mechanism of HDL denaturation with concomitant apoA-I dissociation with HDL preparations from 48 patients with a wide range of plasma HDL-C and evaluated the contribution of lipid-free apoA-I into cholesterol efflux from macrophage, in particular, mediated by cholesterol transporter ABCA1. We prepared HDL by precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins by polyethylene glycol and used the chaotropic agent urea to denature HDL preparations. Apo-I dissociation from urea-treated HDL was assessed by the increase of preβ-band fraction with agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electro transfer and immunodetection and by the increase of ABCA1-mediated efflux of fluorescent analogue BODIPY-Cholesterol from RAW 264.7 macrophages. The HDL denaturation is governed by a single transition to fully dissociated apoA-I and the transition cooperativity decreases with increasing HDL-C. The apoA-I release depends on phospholipid concentration of HDL preparation and HDL compositional and structural heterogeneity and is well described by apolipoprotein partition between aqueous and lipid phases. Dissociated apoA-I determines the increase of ABCA1-mediated efflux of BODIPY-Cholesterol from RAW 264.7 macrophages to patient HDL. The increase in apoA-I dissociation is associated with the increase of ABCA1 gene transcript in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients. The low level of plasma HDL particles may be compensated by their increased potency for apoA-I release, thus suggesting apoA-I dissociation as a new HDL functional property.

Abstract: Myocardin (MYOCD) plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. However, its underlying impact on atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a key membrane-associated lipid transporter which maintains intracellular lipid homeostasis, has a protective function in atherosclerosis progress. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how the effect of MYOCD on atherosclerosis is associated with ABCA1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found both MYOCD and ABCA1 expression were dramatically decreased in atherosclerotic patient aortas compared to control. MYOCD knockdown inhibited ABCA1 expression in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs), leading to reduced cholesterol efflux and increased intracellular cholesterol contents. MYOCD overexpression exerted the opposite effect. Mechanistically, MYOCD regulates ABCA1 expression in an SRF-dependent manner. Consistently, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice treated with MYOCD shRNA developed more plaques in the aortic sinus, which is associated with reduced ABCA1 expression, increased cholesterol retention in the aorta, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the plasma. Our data suggest that MYOCD deficiency exacerbates atherosclerosis by downregulating ABCA1 dependent cholesterol efflux from VSMCs, thereby providing a novel strategy for the therapeutic treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLR) are crucial for recognizing bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens and to orchestrate the appropriate immune response. The widely expressed TLR2 and TLR4 differentially recognize various pathogens to initiate partly overlapping immune cascades. To better understand the physiological consequences of both immune responses, we performed comparative lipidomic analyses of local paw inflammation in mice induced by the TLR2 and TLR4 agonists, zymosan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, which are commonly used in models for inflammation and inflammatory pain. Doses for both agonists were chosen to cause mechanical hypersensitivity with identical strength and duration. Lipidomic analysis showed 5 h after LPS or zymosan injection in both models an increase of ether-phosphatidylcholines (PC O) and their corresponding lyso species with additional lipids being increased only in response to LPS. However, zymosan induced stronger immune cell recruitment and edema formation as compared to LPS. Importantly, only in LPS-induced inflammation the lipid profile in the contralateral paw was altered. Fittingly, the plasma level of various cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1β and IL-6, were significantly increased only in LPS-treated mice. Accordingly LPS induced distinct changes in the lipid profiles of ipsilateral and contralateral paws. Here, oxydized fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were uniquely upregulated on the contralateral side. Thus, both models cause increased levels of PC O and lyso-PC O lipids at the site of inflammation pointing at a common role in inflammation. Also, LPS initiates systemic changes, which can be detected by changes in the lipid profiles.

Abstract: MicroRNA-221-3p (miR-221-3p) is associated with both metabolic diseases and cancers. However, its role in terminal adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism are uncharacterized. miR-221-3p or its inhibitor was transfected into differentiating or mature human adipocytes. Triglyceride (TG) content and adipogenic gene expression were monitored, global lipidome analysis was carried out, and mechanisms underlying the effects of miR-221-3p were investigated. Finally, cross-talk between miR-221-3p expressing adipocytes and MCF-7 breast carcinoma (BC) cells was studied, and miR-221-3p expression in tumor-proximal adipose biopsies from BC patients analyzed. miR-221-3p overexpression inhibited terminal differentiation of adipocytes, as judged from reduced TG storage and gene expression of the adipogenic markers SCD1, GLUT4, FAS, DGAT1/2, AP2, ATGL and AdipoQ, whereas the miR-221-3p inhibitor increased TG storage. Knockdown of the predicted miR-221-3p target, 14-3-3γ, had similar antiadipogenic effects as miR-221-3p overexpression, indicating it as a potential mediator of mir-221-3p function. Importantly, miR-221-3p overexpression inhibited de novo lipogenesis but increased the concentrations of ceramides and sphingomyelins, while reducing diacylglycerols, concomitant with suppression of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, ATP citrate lyase, and acid ceramidase. miR-221-3p expression was elevated in tumor proximal adipose tissue from patients with invasive BC. Conditioned medium of miR-221-3p overexpressing adipocytes stimulated the invasion and proliferation of BC cells, while medium of the BC cells enhanced miR-221-3p expression in adipocytes. Elevated miR-221-3p impairs adipocyte lipid storage and differentiation, and modifies their ceramide, sphingomyelin, and diacylglycerol content. These alterations are relevant for metabolic diseases but may also affect cancer progression.

Abstract: Combined exposure to dietary nutrients and environmental chemicals may elicit significantly different physiological effects than single exposures. Exposure to dietary saturated fats and environmental toxins is a physiologically-significant dual exposure that is particularly associated with lower socioeconomic status, potentially placing these individuals at heightened risk of xenobiotic toxicities. However, no prior studies have examined interactions between specific lipids and environmental xenobiotics in modulating cellular health. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we have discovered that prior exposure to the saturated fatty acid, palmitate, exacerbates cellular toxicity associated with the industrial plasticizer, bisphenol A (BPA). Cell death upon BPA exposure following palmitate pre-treatment was greater than that occurring with either exposure alone. Mechanistically, cell death was preceded by increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in palmitate plus BPA exposed cells, leading to increased caspase-3 cleavage and subsequent apoptosis. Interestingly, inclusion of the unsaturated fatty acid, oleate, along with palmitate during the pre-treatment period completely abrogated the ER stress, mitochondrial toxicity, and cell death induced by subsequent exposure to BPA. Thus, our data identify for the first time an important interaction between a fatty acid and an environmental toxin and have implications for developing nutritional interventions to mitigate the deleterious effects of such xenobiotic exposures.

Abstract: We have reported that acrolein-conjugated low-density lipoprotein (Acro-LDL) uptake by scavenger receptor class A type 1 (SR-A1) can mediate macrophage foam cell formation. The purpose of this study was to determine which amino acid residues of apoB protein in LDL are conjugated with acrolein. Acro-apoB was prepared by incubation of LDL with acrolein (10 to 60 μM) at 37 °C for 7 days. Identification of acrolein-conjugated amino acid residues in apoB was performed using LC-MS/MS. The levels of acrolein-conjugated amino acid residues of apoB as well as crosslinking apoB increased in proportion to acrolein concentration. The level of LDL uptake by macrophages was parallel with the acrolein-conjugated monomer apoB. Acrolein-conjugated amino acid residues in apoB were C212, K327, K742, K949, K1087, H1923, K2634, K3237 and K3846. The NH2-teriminal four amino acid residues (C212, K327, K742 and K949) were located at the scavenger receptor SR-A1 recognition site, suggesting that these four acrolein-conjugated amino acids are involved in the rapid uptake of Acro-LDL by macrophages. It is proposed that the rapid uptake of LDL by macrophages is dependent on acrolein conjugation of four amino acids residues at the scavenger receptor recognition site of apoB in LDL.

Lysophosphatidic acid receptors 2 and 3 regulate erythropoiesis at different hematopoietic stages,

Abstract: Hematopoiesis, the complex developmental process that forms blood components and replenishes the blood system, involves multiple intracellular and extracellular mechanisms. We previously demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid growth factor, has opposing regulatory effects on erythrocyte differentiation through activation of LPA receptors 2 and 3; yet the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, LPA2 is observed that highly expressed in common myeloid progenitors (CMP) in murine myeloid cells, whereas the expression of LPA3 displaces in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) of later stage of myeloid differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the switching expression of LPA2 and LPA3 determine the hematic homeostasis of mammalian megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage. In vitro colony-forming unit assays of murine progenitors reveal that LPA2 agonist GRI reduces the erythroblast differentiation potential of CMP. In contrast, LPA3 agonist OMPT increases the production of erythrocytes from megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEP). In addition, treatment with GRI reduces the erythroid, CMP, and MEP populations in mice, indicating that LPA2 predominantly inhibits myeloid differentiation at an early stage. In contrast, activation of LPA3 increases the production of terminally differentiated erythroid cells through activation of erythropoietic transcriptional factor. We also demonstrate that the LPA3 signaling is essential for restoration of phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced acute hemolytic anemia in mice and correlates to erythropoiesis impairment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria Symptom (HGPS) premature aging expressed K562 model. Our results reveal the distinct roles of LPA2 and LPA3 at different stages of hematopoiesis in vivo, providing potentiated therapeutic strategies of anemia treatment.

Abstract: Sphingolipids represent a family of cellular lipid-molecules that regulate physiological and pathophysiological processes. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the simplest glycosphingolipid (GSL), is synthesized from ceramide and UDP-glucose by GlcCer synthase (GCS). Both GlcCer (and resulting GSLs) and ceramide regulate various cellular functions including cell death and multiple drug resistance. Src family tyrosine kinases are up-regulated in various human cancer cells. We examined the effect of v-Src expression on GCS activity, the formation of 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-labeled GlcCer from NBD-ceramide, and the effect of tyrosine132 mutation in GCS on ceramide-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. Expression of v-Src increased the formation of NBD-GlcCer in both intact cells without marked changes in other sphingolipid metabolites and cell homogenates without changing affinities of NBD-ceramide and UDP-glucose. Expression of v-Src also increased tyrosine-phosphorylated levels in GCS proteins in HeLa and HEK293T cells. In HEK293T cells transiently expressing the GCS mutant, GCS-Y132F-HA, showing replacement of the tyrosine132 residue with phenylalanine, tyrosine-phosphorylated levels in GCS proteins were significantly lower than those in control cells expressing the GCS-wild-type-HA. The formation of NBD-GlcCer in HeLa cells stably expressing GCS-Y132F-HA was significantly lower than that in the control. Ceramide-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa-GCS-Y132F-HA cells was significantly greater than in the control. In this study, we showed for the first time that expression of v-Src up-regulated GCS activity via tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme in a post-translational manner. Mechanisms of Src-induced resistance to ceramide-induced cytotoxicity are discussed in relation to the Src-induced up-regulation of GCS activity.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that AKR vs. DBA/2 mouse bone marrow derived macrophages have higher levels of free cholesterol and lower levels of esterified cholesterol after cholesterol loading, and that AKR, but not DBA/2, macrophages induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression after cholesterol loading. We earlier determined that the free and esterified cholesterol level effect is due to a truncation in the sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (Soat1) gene, encoding acetyl-coenzyme A acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). Here we examined the mechanism for the differential induction of CHOP by cholesterol loading. CHOP was induced in both strains after incubation with tunicamycin, indicating both strains have competent endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. CHOP was induced when DBA/2 macrophages were cholesterol loaded in the presence of an ACAT inhibitor, indicating that the difference in free cholesterol levels were responsible for this strain effect. This finding was confirmed in macrophages derived from DBA/2 embryonic stem cells. Cholesterol loading of Soat1 gene edited cells, mimicking the AKR allele, led to increased free cholesterol levels and restored CHOP induction. The upstream pathway of free cholesterol induced endoplasmic reticulum stress was investigated; and, RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α protein kinase (IRE1α) pathways were required for maximal CHOP expression.

Abstract: A comprehensive molecular mechanistic role of lutein on adipogenesis is not well understood. The present study focused to evaluate the effect of lutein at the early and late phase of adipocyte differentiation in vitro using a 3T3-L1 cell model. The effect of purified carotenoid on the viability of normal and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells was analyzed by WST-1 assay. Oil Red O and Nile red staining were employed to observe lipid droplets in mature adipocytes. The effect of lutein on gene and protein expression of major transcription factors and adipogenic markers was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The role of lutein on mitotic clonal expansion was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the accumulation of lipid droplets in lutein-treated (5 μM) cells. Inhibition in lipid accumulation was associated with down-regulated expression of CEBP-α and PPAR-γ at gene and protein levels. Subsequently, lutein repressed gene expression of FAS, FABP4, and SCD1 in mature adipocytes. Interestingly, it blocks the protein expression of CEBP-α and PPAR-γ in the initial stages of adipocyte differentiation. This early-stage inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is linked with repressed phosphorylation AKT and ERK. Further, upregulated cyclin D and down-regulated CDK4 and CDK2 in lutein treated adipocytes enumerate its role in delaying the cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. Our results emphasize that adipogenesis inhibitory efficacy of lutein is potentiated by halting early phase regulators of adipocyte differentiation, which strengthens the competency of lutein besides its inevitable presence in the human body.
