Abstract: Summary
RNA can regulate its own synthesis without auxiliary proteins. For example, U-rich RNA sequences signal RNA polymerase (RNAP) to pause transcription and are required for transcript release at intrinsic terminators in all kingdoms of life. In contrast, the regulatory RNA putL suppresses pausing and termination in cis. However, how nascent RNA modulates its own synthesis remains largely unknown. We present cryo-EM reconstructions of RNAP captured during transcription of putL variants or an unrelated sequence at a U-rich pause site. Our results suggest how putL suppresses pausing and promotes its synthesis. We demonstrate that transcribing a U-rich sequence, a ubiquitous trigger of intrinsic termination, promotes widening of the RNAP nucleic-acid-binding channel. Widening destabilizes RNAP interactions with DNA and RNA to facilitate transcript dissociation reminiscent of intrinsic transcription termination. Surprisingly, RNAP remains bound to DNA after transcript release. Our results provide the structural framework to understand RNA-mediated intrinsic transcription termination.

Abstract: Summary
To determine which transcripts should reach the cytoplasm for translation, eukaryotic cells have established mechanisms to regulate selective mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The nuclear basket, a substructure of the NPC protruding into the nucleoplasm, is thought to function as a stable platform where mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) are rearranged and undergo quality control prior to export, ensuring that only mature mRNAs reach the cytoplasm. Here, we use proteomic, genetic, live-cell, and single-molecule resolution microscopy approaches in budding yeast to demonstrate that basket formation is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription and subsequent mRNP processing. We further show that while all NPCs can bind Mlp1, baskets assemble only on a subset of nucleoplasmic NPCs, and these basket-containing NPCs associate a distinct protein and RNA interactome. Taken together, our data point toward NPC heterogeneity and an RNA-dependent mechanism for functionalization of NPCs in budding yeast through nuclear basket assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in cancer cells undergoing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes survival. However, how UPR in tumor cells impacts anti-tumor immune responses remains poorly described. Here, we investigate the role of the UPR mediator pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) in cancer cells in the modulation of anti-tumor immunity. Deletion of PERK in cancer cells or pharmacological inhibition of PERK in melanoma-bearing mice incites robust activation of anti-tumor T cell immunity and attenuates tumor growth. PERK elimination in ER-stressed malignant cells triggers SEC61β-induced paraptosis, thereby promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and systemic anti-tumor responses. ICD induction in PERK-ablated tumors stimulates type I interferon production in dendritic cells (DCs), which primes CCR2-dependent tumor trafficking of common-monocytic precursors and their intra-tumor commitment into monocytic-lineage inflammatory Ly6C+CD103+ DCs. These findings identify how tumor cell-derived PERK promotes immune evasion and highlight the potential of PERK-targeting therapies in cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neurotransmission mediated by diverse subtypes of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is fundamental for basic brain functions and development as well as neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders. NMDARs are glycine- and glutamate-gated ion channels that exist as heterotetramers composed of obligatory GluN1 and GluN2(A-D) and/or GluN3(A-B). The GluN2C and GluN2D subunits form ion channels with distinct properties and spatio-temporal expression patterns. Here, we provide the structures of the agonist-bound human GluN1-2C NMDAR in the presence and absence of the GluN2C-selective positive allosteric potentiator (PAM), PYD-106, the agonist-bound GluN1-2A-2C tri-heteromeric NMDAR, and agonist-bound GluN1-2D NMDARs by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. Our analysis shows unique inter-subunit and domain arrangements of the GluN2C NMDARs, which contribute to functional regulation and formation of the PAM binding pocket and is distinct from GluN2D NMDARs. Our findings here provide the fundamental blueprint to study GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing NMDARs, which are uniquely involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Copper deficiency has emerged to be associated with various lipid metabolism diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms that dictate the association between copper deficiency and metabolic diseases remain obscure. Here, we reveal that copper restoration caused by hepatic ceruloplasmin (Cp) ablation enhances lipid catabolism by promoting the assembly of copper-load SCO1-LKB1-AMPK complex. Overnutrition-mediated Cp elevation results in hepatic copper loss, whereas Cp ablation restores copper content to the normal level without eliciting detectable hepatotoxicity and ameliorates NAFLD in mice. Mechanistically, SCO1 constitutively interacts with LKB1 even in the absence of copper, and copper-loaded SCO1 directly tethers LKB1 to AMPK, thereby activating AMPK and consequently promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, this study reveals a mechanism by which copper, as a signaling molecule, improves hepatic lipid catabolism, and it indicates that targeting copper-SCO1-AMPK signaling pathway ameliorates NAFLD development by modulating AMPK activity.

Abstract: Summary
Plants have evolved signaling mechanisms that guide growth away from adverse environments that can cause yield losses. Root halotropism is a sodium-specific negative tropism that is crucial for surviving and thriving under high salinity. Although root halotropism was discovered some years ago, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated root twisting determines halotropism in Arabidopsis. An ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinase (SnRK2.6) phosphorylates the microtubule-associated protein SP2L at Ser406, which induces a change in the anisotropic cell expansion at the root transition zone and is required for root twisting during halotropism. Salt stress triggers SP2L-mediated cortical microtubule reorientation, which guides cellulose microfibril patterns. Our findings thus outline the molecular mechanism of root halotropism and indicate that anisotropic cell expansion through microtubule reorientation and microfibril deposition has a central role in mediating tropic responses.

Abstract: Summary
How cancer-associated chromatin abnormalities shape tumor-immune interaction remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have linked DNA hypomethylation and de-repression of retrotransposons to anti-tumor immunity through the induction of interferon response. Here, we report that inactivation of the histone H3K36 methyltransferase NSD1, which is frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and induces DNA hypomethylation, unexpectedly results in diminished tumor immune infiltration. In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Inhibition of EZH2 restores immune infiltration and impairs the growth of Nsd1-mutant tumors. Thus, our work uncovers a druggable chromatin cross talk that regulates the viral mimicry response and enables immune evasion of DNA hypomethylated tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The function and regulation of different heterogeneous reactive states of astrocytes in depression remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that neurotoxic reactive (A1-like) astrocytes are strongly induced, prior to behavioral impairments and dendritic atrophy, in depression-like mice. More interestingly, global or microglia-specific knockout of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (Nlrp3) markedly mitigates A1-like astrocyte induction, whereas astrocyte-specific Nlrp3 depletion is ineffective. Microglial Nlrp3 ablation also alleviates the neuronal dysfunction induced by A1-like astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. We further show that in microglia the NF-κB pathway activates the NLRP3 inflammasome which in turn activates caspase-1 to induce the secretion of A1 inductors, leading to the production of A1-like astrocytes. Altogether, this study reveals the function of microglial NLRP3 inflammasome in the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes via activating neuroinflammatory caspase-1 pathway in response to chronic stress and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for depression.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heritable metabolic disorder. While population studies have identified hundreds of common genetic variants associated with T2D, the role of rare (frequency < 0.1%) protein-coding variation is less clear. We performed exome sequence analysis in 418,436 (n = 32,374 T2D cases) individuals in the UK Biobank. We identified previously reported genes (GCK, GIGYF1, HNF1A) in addition to missense variants in ZEB2 (n = 31 carriers; odds ratio [OR] = 5.5 [95% confidence interval = 2.5–12.0]; p = 6.4 × 10−7), MLXIPL (n = 245; OR = 2.3 [1.6–3.2]; p = 3.2 × 10−7), and IGF1R (n = 394; OR = 2.4 [1.8–3.2]; p = 1.3 × 10−10). Carriers of damaging missense variants within IGF1R were also shorter (−2.2 cm [−1.8 to –2.7]; p = 1.2 × 10−19) and had higher circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) protein levels (2.3 nmol/L [1.7–2.9]; p = 2.8 × 10−14), indicating relative IGF-1 resistance. A likely causal role of IGF-1 resistance was supported by Mendelian randomization analyses using common variants. These results increase understanding of the genetic architecture of T2D and highlight the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Episodic memories formed in early childhood rapidly decay, but their latent traces remain stored long term. These memories require the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and seem to undergo a developmental critical period. It remains to be determined whether the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), a major mechanism of critical periods, contributes to memory development. Here, we show that episodic infantile learning significantly increases the levels of parvalbumin in the dHPC 48 h after training. Chemogenetic inhibition of PVIs before learning indicated that these neurons are required for infantile memory formation. A bilateral dHPC injection of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor agonist diazepam after training elicited long-term memory expression in infant rats, although direct PVI chemogenetic activation had no effect. Finally, PVI activity was required for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent maturation of memory competence, i.e., adult-like long-term memory expression. Thus, dHPC PVIs are critical for the formation of infantile memories and for memory development.

Abstract: Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cellular fate across species, being important for the differentiation and development of several cell types. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Notch inhibition pathway by dibenzazepine (DBZ) in histological and inflammatory alterations and, tissue parasitism in acute Toxoplasma gondii infection. For this, C57BL/6 mice were treated with DBZ before infection with T. gondii, and the small intestine, lungs and liver were analyzed. The genes related to Notch signaling pathway were assayed through qPCR in the organs, and cytokine measurement was performed in serum samples. In the small intestine, T. gondii infection impaired the Hes1 and Math1 mRNA expressions, increased the inflammation and decreased goblet and Paneth cell numbers. The DBZ-treatment was able to partially preserve these cells, however, the parasitism and inflammation were not altered. In parallel, the high IL-2, IL-6, TNF and, IFN-γ levels induced by infection were not changed with the DBZ treatment, with the IFN-γ levels even higher. In contrast, in the liver and lungs, the DBZ-treatment diminished parasitism and inflammation. Our results highlight that Notch pathway inhibition in T.gondii infection results in different parasitological and inflammatory outcomes depending on the organ analyzed.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the revolution of immunotherapy in cancer treatment, patients eventually progress due to the emergence of resistance. In this scenario, the selection of the tumor antigen can be decisive in the success of the clinical response. T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are engineered molecules that include binding sites to the T cell receptor and to a tumor antigen. Using gastric CEA+/HER2+ MKN45 cells and TCBs directed against CEA or HER2, we show that the mechanism of resistance to a TCB is dependent on the tumor antigen. Acquired resistant models to a high-affinity-CEA-targeted TCB exhibit a reduction of CEA levels due to transcriptional silencing, which is reversible upon 5-AZA treatment. In contrast, a HER2-TCB resistant model maintains HER2 levels and exhibit a disruption of the interferon-gamma signaling. These results will help in the design of combinatorial strategies to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies and to anticipate and overcome resistances.

Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV employs diverse strategies to evade host antiviral innate immune responses to mediate a persistent infection. In the present study, we show that nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interacts with an NF-κB inhibitor immunomodulatory kinase, IKKε, and subsequently downregulates beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter activity. We further demonstrate that NS5A inhibits DDX3-mediated IKKε and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation. We also note that hyperphosphorylation of NS5A mediates protein interplay between NS5A and IKKε, thereby contributing to NS5A mediated modulation of IFN-β signaling. Lastly, NS5A inhibits IKKε-dependent p65 phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. Based on these findings, we propose NS5A as a novel regulator of IFN signaling events, specifically by inhibiting IKKε downstream signaling cascades through its interaction with IKKε. Taken together, these data suggest an additional mechanistic means by which HCV modulates host antiviral innate immune responses to promote persistent viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110β is involved in tumorigenesis and hemostasis. However, it remains unclear if p110β also regulates platelet-mediated immune responses, which could have important consequences for immune modulation during anti-cancer treatment with p110β inhibitors. Thus, we investigate how platelet p110β affects inflammation and infection. Using a mouse model of Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced pneumonia, we find that both platelet-specific p110β deficiency and pharmacologic inhibition of p110β with TGX-221 exacerbate disease pathogenesis by preventing platelet-monocyte and neutrophil interactions, diminishing their infiltration and enhancing bacterial dissemination. Platelet p110β mediates neutrophil phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae in vitro and curtails bacteremia in vivo. Genetic deficiency or inhibition of platelet p110β also impairs macrophage recruitment in an independent model of sterile peritonitis. Our results demonstrate that platelet p110β dysfunction exacerbates pulmonary infection by impeding leukocyte functions. Thereby, our findings provide important insights into the immunomodulatory potential of PI3K inhibitors in bacterial infection.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapy often depends on recognition of peptide epitopes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is enriched for peroxynitrite (PNT), a potent oxidant produced by infiltrating myeloid cells and some tumor cells. We demonstrate that PNT alters the profile of MHC class I bound peptides presented on tumor cells. Only CTLs specific for PNT-resistant peptides have a strong antitumor effect in vivo, whereas CTLs specific for PNT-sensitive peptides are not effective. Therapeutic targeting of PNT in mice reduces resistance of tumor cells to CTLs. Melanoma patients with low PNT activity in their tumors demonstrate a better clinical response to immunotherapy than patients with high PNT activity. Our data suggest that intratumoral PNT activity should be considered for the design of neoantigen-based therapy and also may be an important immunotherapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Cytoskeleton proteins have been reported to be involved in the host antiviral immune responses. However, how cytoskeleton proteins regulate host antiviral immune responses is not fully understood. Here we report that the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN-I) production upon viral infection. Ectopic expression of vimentin suppresses RNA- and DNA viruses-induced IFN-I production, whereas knockout of vimentin expression enhances IFN-I production. Viral infection increases vimentin expression and ultimately inhibits IFN-I production. Mechanistically, upregulated vimentin interacts with TBK1 and IKKε to disrupt the interactions of TBK1-IRF3 and IKKε-IRF3, resulting in inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we generate vimentin knockout mice to confirm that deficiency of vimentin gene in mice suppressed encephalomyocarditis virus replication in vivo. Our findings demonstrates that vimentin plays an important role in regulating IFN-I production, revealing its antiviral function of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin.

Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are essential elements of striatal circuits and functions. Although acetylcholine signaling via muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) has been well studied, more recent data indicate that postsynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) located on striatal GABAergic interneurons (GINs) are equally critical. One example is that CIN stimulation induces large disynaptic inhibition of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) mediated by nAChR activation of GINs. Although these circuits are ideally positioned to modulate striatal output, the neurons involved are not definitively identified because of an incomplete mapping of CINs-GINs interconnections. Here, we show that CINs modulate four GINs populations via an intricate mechanism involving co-activation of presynaptic and postsynaptic mAChRs and nAChRs. Using optogenetics, we demonstrate the participation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing GINs in the disynaptic inhibition of SPNs via heterotypic electrical coupling with neurogliaform interneurons. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of CINs in regulating GINs microcircuits via complex synaptic/heterosynaptic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP)ribosylation inhibitors (PARPis) are toxic to cancer cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency but not to HR-proficient cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). As TAMs can promote or inhibit tumor growth, we set out to examine the effects of PARP inhibition on TAMs in BRCA1-related breast cancer (BC). The PARPi olaparib causes reprogramming of TAMs toward higher cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. A PARPi-related surge in NAD+ increases glycolysis, blunts oxidative phosphorylation, and induces reverse mitochondrial electron transport (RET) with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcriptional reprogramming. This reprogramming occurs in the absence or presence of PARP1 or PARP2 and is partially recapitulated by addition of NAD derivative methyl-nicotinamide (MNA). In vivo and ex vivo, the effect of olaparib on TAMs contributes to the anti-tumor efficacy of the PARPi. In vivo blockade of the “don’t-eat-me signal” with CD47 antibodies in combination with olaparib improves outcomes in a BRCA1-related BC model.

Abstract: Summary
Noradrenergic afferents to hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons provide a major excitatory drive to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via α1 adrenoreceptor activation. Noradrenergic afferents are recruited preferentially by somatic, rather than psychological, stress stimuli. Stress-induced glucocorticoids feed back onto the hypothalamus to negatively regulate the HPA axis, providing a critical autoregulatory constraint that prevents glucocorticoid overexposure and neuropathology. Whether negative feedback mechanisms target stress modality-specific HPA activation is not known. Here, we describe a desensitization of the α1 adrenoreceptor activation of the HPA axis following acute stress in male mice that is mediated by rapid glucocorticoid regulation of adrenoreceptor trafficking in CRH neurons. Glucocorticoid-induced α1 receptor trafficking desensitizes the HPA axis to a somatic but not a psychological stressor. Our findings demonstrate a rapid glucocorticoid suppression of adrenergic signaling in CRH neurons that is specific to somatic stress activation, and they reveal a rapid, stress modality-selective glucocorticoid negative feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Self versus non-self discrimination is a key element of innate and adaptive immunity across life. In bacteria, CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems recognize non-self nucleic acids through their sequence and their methylation state, respectively. Here, we show that the Wadjet defense system recognizes DNA topology to protect its host against plasmid transformation. By combining cryoelectron microscopy with cross-linking mass spectrometry, we show that Wadjet forms a complex similar to the bacterial condensin complex MukBEF, with a novel nuclease subunit similar to a type II DNA topoisomerase. Wadjet specifically cleaves closed-circular DNA in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis by the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) ATPase subunit JetC, suggesting that the complex could use DNA loop extrusion to sense its substrate’s topology, then specifically activate the nuclease subunit JetD to cleave plasmid DNA. Overall, our data reveal how bacteria have co-opted a DNA maintenance machine to specifically recognize and destroy foreign DNAs through topology sensing.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic genome is organized in 3D at different scales. This structure is driven and maintained by different chromatin states and by architectural factors, such as the zinc finger protein CTCF. Zygotic genome structure is established de novo after fertilization, but its impact during the first stages of mammalian development is unclear. We show that deletion of Ctcf in mouse embryos impairs the establishment of chromatin structure, but the first cell fate decision is unperturbed and embryos are viable until the late blastocyst. Furthermore, maternal CTCF is not necessary for development. Gene expression changes in metabolic and protein homeostasis programs that occur during the morula-to-blastocyst transition depend on CTCF. However, these changes do not correlate with disruption of chromatin but with binding of CTCF to the promoter of downregulated genes. Our results show that CTCF regulates both 3D genome organization and transcription during mouse preimplantation development, but as independent processes.

Abstract: Summary
Ketone bodies are increasingly understood to have regulatory effects on immune cell function, with β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerting a predominantly anti-inflammatory response. Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body availability such as the ketogenic diet (KD) have recently been shown to alleviate inflammation of the respiratory tract. However, the role of BHB has not been addressed. Here, we observe that BHB suppresses group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)-mediated airway inflammation. Central to this are mast cells, which support ILC2 proliferation through interleukin-2 (IL-2). Suppression of the mast cell/IL-2 axis by BHB attenuates ILC2 proliferation and the ensuing type 2 cytokine response and immunopathology. Mechanistically, BHB directly inhibits mast cell function in part through GPR109A activation. Similar effects are achieved with either the KD or 1,3-butanediol. Our data reveal the protective role of BHB in ILC2-driven airway inflammation, which underscores the potential therapeutic value of ketone body supplementation for the management of asthma.

Abstract: Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the cell envelope in most bacteria, responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell and protecting the cell from environmental stresses. The growth of the PG layer during cell elongation and division is facilitated by the coordinated activities of PG synthases and hydrolases. PG synthases are regulated from inside the cell by components of the elongasome and divisome complexes driven by the cytoskeletal proteins MreB and FtsZ. In Escherichia coli the PG synthases PBP1A and PBP1B require the activation by outer membrane (OM)-anchored lipoproteins LpoA and LpoB, respectively. These have an elongated structure and are capable to span the periplasm to reach their cognate, cytoplasmic membrane (CM)-anchored PG synthase through the PG layer. Presumably, the Lpo proteins activate the PBPs at sites where the PG mesh is stretched or defective, resulting in coupling of PG synthase activation with cell growth or PG repair. Here we investigated the importance of OM-anchoring on the function of Lpo proteins in regulating PG synthesis in response to environmental stresses. We investigated the effects of an artificially CM-tethered LpoB on cell morphology and PG synthesis. Our results indicate that mis-localization of LpoB affects the growth and morphology of cells in high osmolarity growth medium, and PG synthesis rate upon an osmotic upshift.

Abstract: Summary
A scarcity of functionally validated enhancers in the human genome presents a significant hurdle to understanding how these cis-regulatory elements contribute to human diseases. We carry out highly multiplexed CRISPR-based perturbation and sequencing to identify enhancers required for cell proliferation and fitness in 10 human cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that the cell fitness enhancers, unlike their target genes, display high cell-type specificity of chromatin features. They typically adopt a modular structure, comprised of activating elements enriched for motifs of oncogenic transcription factors, surrounded by repressive elements enriched for motifs recognized by transcription factors with tumor suppressor functions. We further identify cell fitness enhancers that are selectively accessible in clinical tumor samples, and the levels of chromatin accessibility are associated with patient survival. These results reveal functional enhancers across multiple cancer cell lines, characterize their context-dependent chromatin organization, and yield insights into altered transcription programs in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Translation of 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs encoding the protein synthesis machinery is strictly regulated by an amino-acid-sensing mTOR pathway. However, its regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TOP mRNA translation positively correlates with its poly(A) tail length under mTOR active/amino-acid-rich conditions, suggesting that TOP mRNAs are post-transcriptionally controlled by poly(A) tail-length regulation. Consistent with this, the tail length of TOP mRNAs dynamically fluctuates in response to amino acid availability. The poly(A) tail shortens under mTOR active/amino-acid-rich conditions, whereas the long-tailed TOP mRNAs accumulate under mTOR inactive/amino-acid-starved (AAS) conditions. An RNA-binding protein, LARP1, is indispensable for the process. LARP1 interacts with non-canonical poly(A) polymerases and induces post-transcriptional polyadenylation of the target. Our findings illustrate that LARP1 contributes to the selective accumulation of TOP mRNAs with long poly(A) tails under AAS, resulting in accelerated ribosomal loading onto TOP mRNAs for the resumption of translation after AAS.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional control is a highly dynamic process that changes rapidly in response to various cellular and extracellular cues, making it difficult to define the mechanism of transcription factor function using slow genetic methods. We used a chemical-genetic approach to rapidly degrade a canonical transcriptional activator, PAX3-FOXO1, to define the mechanism by which it regulates gene expression programs. By coupling rapid protein degradation with the analysis of nascent transcription over short time courses and integrating CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, and eRNA analysis with deep proteomic analysis, we defined PAX3-FOXO1 function at a small network of direct transcriptional targets. PAX3-FOXO1 degradation impaired RNA polymerase pause release and transcription elongation at most regulated gene targets. Moreover, the activity of PAX3-FOXO1 at enhancers controlling this core network was surprisingly selective, affecting single elements in super-enhancers. This combinatorial analysis indicated that PAX3-FOXO1 was continuously required to maintain chromatin accessibility and enhancer architecture at regulated enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
GM-CSF co-expressing T17 cells instigate pathologic inflammation during autoimmune disorders, but their function in immunity to infections is unclear. Here, we demonstrate the role of GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells for vaccine immunity against lethal fungal pneumonia and the cytokine requirements for their induction and memory homeostasis. Vaccine-induced GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells are necessary to bolster pulmonary fungal immunity without inflating pathology. Although GM-CSF expressing Tc17 cells preferentially elevate during the memory phase, their phenotypic attributes strongly suggest they are more like Tc17 cells than IFNγ-producing Tc1 cells. IL-1 and IL-23, but not GM-CSF, are necessary to elicit GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells following vaccination. IL-23 is dispensable for memory Tc17 and GM-CSF+ Tc17 cell maintenance, but recall responses of effector or memory Tc17 cells in the lung require it. Our study reveals the beneficial, nonpathological role of GM-CSF+ Tc17 cells during fungal vaccine immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) incises DNA containing ribonucleotides to generate complex DNA lesions that are resolved by APE2 (Apn2 in yeast). How Apn2 engages and processes this DNA damage is unclear. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures and biochemical analysis of Apn2-DNA complexes to demonstrate how Apn2 frays and cleaves 3′ DNA termini via a wedging mechanism that facilitates 1–6 nucleotide endonucleolytic cleavages. APN2 deletion and DNA-wedge mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains display mutator phenotypes, cell growth defects, and sensitivity to genotoxic stress in a ribonucleotide excision repair (RER)-defective background harboring a high density of Top1-incised ribonucleotides. Our data implicate a wedge-and-cut mechanism underpinning the broad-specificity Apn2 nuclease activity that mitigates mutagenic and genome instability phenotypes caused by Top1 incision at genomic ribonucleotides incorporated by DNA polymerase epsilon.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between the epithelium and the immune system are critical in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we mapped the transcriptional landscape of human colonic epithelial organoids in response to different cytokines responsible for mediating canonical mucosal immune responses. By profiling the transcriptome of human colonic organoids treated with the canonical cytokines interferon gamma, interleukin-13, -17A, and tumor necrosis factor alpha with next-generation sequencing, we unveil shared and distinct regulation patterns of epithelial function by different cytokines. An integrative analysis of cytokine responses in diseased tissue from patients with IBD (n = 1,009) reveals a molecular classification of mucosal inflammation defined by gradients of cytokine-responsive transcriptional signatures. Our systems biology approach detected signaling bottlenecks in cytokine-responsive networks and highlighted their translational potential as theragnostic targets in intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza infection imparts an age-related increase in mortality and morbidity. The most effective countermeasure is vaccination; however, vaccines offer modest protection in older adults. To investigate how aging impacts the memory B cell response, we track hemagglutinin-specific B cells by indexed flow sorting and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in 20 healthy adults that were administered the trivalent influenza vaccine. We demonstrate age-related skewing in the memory B cell compartment 6 weeks after vaccination, with younger adults developing hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells with an FcRL5+ “atypical” phenotype, showing evidence of somatic hypermutation and positive selection, which happened to a lesser extent in older persons. We use publicly available scRNA-seq from paired human lymph node and blood samples to corroborate that FcRL5+ atypical memory B cells can derive from germinal center (GC) precursors. Together, this study shows that the aged human GC reaction and memory B cell response following vaccination is defective.

Abstract: Summary
Genomics-driven drug discovery is indispensable for accelerating the development of novel therapeutic targets. However, the drug discovery framework based on evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has not been established, especially for cross-population GWAS meta-analysis. Here, we introduce a practical guideline for genomics-driven drug discovery for cross-population meta-analysis, as lessons from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI). Our drug discovery framework encompassed three methodologies and was applied to the 13 common diseases targeted by GBMI (Nmean = 1,329,242). Individual methodologies complementarily prioritized drugs and drug targets, which were systematically validated by referring previously known drug-disease relationships. Integration of the three methodologies provided a comprehensive catalog of candidate drugs for repositioning, nominating promising drug candidates targeting the genes involved in the coagulation process for venous thromboembolism and the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling pathway for gout. Our study highlighted key factors for successful genomics-driven drug discovery using cross-population meta-analyses.

Abstract: Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain constitute a major source of cholinergic inputs to the forebrain, modulate diverse functions including sensory processing, memory and attention, and are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we classified cholinergic neurons into two distinct subpopulations; calbindin D28K-expressing (D28K+) versus D28K-lacking (D28K−) neurons. Yet, which of these two cholinergic subpopulations are selectively degenerated in AD and the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective degeneration remain unknown. Here, we reported a discovery that D28K+ neurons are selectively degenerated and this degeneration induces anxiety-like behaviors in the early stage of AD. Neuronal type specific deletion of NRADD effectively rescues D28K+ neuronal degeneration, whereas genetic introduction of exogenous NRADD causes D28K− neuronal loss. This gain- and loss-of-function study reveals a subtype specific degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the disease progression of AD and hence warrants a novel molecular target for AD therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in subsets of aggressive cancer. Recent studies have revealed that telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) promotes ALT-associated HDR (ALT-HDR). Here, we report that RAD51AP1, a crucial ALT factor, interacts with TERRA and utilizes it to generate D- and R-loop HR intermediates. We also show that RAD51AP1 binds to and might stabilize TERRA-containing R-loops as RAD51AP1 depletion reduces R-loop formation at telomere DNA breaks. Proteomic analyses uncover a role for RAD51AP1-mediated TERRA R-loop homeostasis in a mechanism of chromatin-directed suppression of TERRA and prevention of transcription-replication collisions (TRCs) during ALT-HDR. Intriguingly, we find that both TERRA binding and this non-canonical function of RAD51AP1 require its intrinsic SUMO-SIM regulatory axis. These findings provide insights into the multi-contextual functions of RAD51AP1 within the ALT mechanism and regulation of TERRA.

Abstract: Summary
Condensins are evolutionarily conserved molecular motors that translocate along DNA and form loops. To address how DNA topology affects condensin translocation, we applied auxin-inducible degradation of topoisomerases I and II and analyzed the binding and function of an interphase condensin that mediates X chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans. TOP-2 depletion reduced long-range spreading of condensin-DC (dosage compensation) from its recruitment sites and shortened 3D DNA contacts measured by Hi-C. TOP-1 depletion did not affect long-range spreading but resulted in condensin-DC accumulation within expressed gene bodies. Both TOP-1 and TOP-2 depletion resulted in X chromosome derepression, indicating that condensin-DC translocation at both scales is required for its function. Together, the distinct effects of TOP-1 and TOP-2 suggest two distinct modes of condensin-DC association with chromatin: long-range DNA loop extrusion that requires decatenation/unknotting of DNA and short-range translocation across genes that requires resolution of transcription-induced supercoiling.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, which can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) regulates NAFLD by regulating metabolism-related gene expression, but an extrachromosomal role for SIRT6 in NAFLD development remains elusive. We investigated whether SIRT6 functions on NAFLD in the cytoplasm. We found that SIRT6 binds saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid. This binding leads to its nuclear export, where it deacetylates long-chain acyl-CoA synthase 5 (ACSL5), thereby facilitating fatty acid oxidation. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD is suppressed by ACSL5 hepatic overexpression but is exacerbated by its depletion. As confirmation, overexpression of a deacetylated ACSL5 mimic attenuated NAFLD in Sirt6 liver-specific knockout mice. Moreover, NASH-hepatic tissues from both patients and diet-fed mice exhibited significantly reduced cytoplasmic SIRT6 levels and increased ACSL5 acetylation. The SIRT6/ACSL5 signaling pathway has a critical role in NAFLD progression and might constitute an avenue for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of appropriate cell states involves epigenetic mechanisms, including Polycomb-group (PcG)-mediated transcriptional repression. While PcG proteins are known to induce chromatin compaction, how PcG proteins gain access to DNA in compact chromatin to achieve long-term silencing is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) co-activator is associated with two-thirds of PcG regions and required for PcG occupancy at many of these in Drosophila and mouse cells. CBP stabilizes RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at PcG-bound repressive sites and promotes Pol II pausing independently of its histone acetyltransferase activity. CBP and Pol II pausing are necessary for RNA-DNA hybrid (R-loop) formation and nucleosome depletion at Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), whereas transcription beyond the pause region is not. These results suggest that non-enzymatic activities of the CBP co-activator have been repurposed to support PcG-mediated silencing, revealing how chromatin regulator interplay maintains transcriptional states.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus is a multi-host pathogen that causes infections in animals and humans globally. The specific genetic loci—and the extent to which they drive cross-species switching, transmissibility, and adaptation—are not well understood. Here, we conducted a population genomic study of 437 S. aureus isolates to identify bacterial genetic variation that determines infection of human and animal hosts through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using linear mixed models. We found genetic variants tagging φSa3 prophage-encoded immune evasion genes associated with human hosts, which contributed ∼99.9% of the overall heritability (∼88%), highlighting their key role in S. aureus human infection. Furthermore, GWAS of pairs of phylogenetically matched human and animal isolates confirmed and uncovered additional loci not implicated in GWAS of unmatched isolates. Our findings reveal the loci that are critical for S. aureus host transmissibility, infection, switching, and adaptation and how their spread alters the specificity of host-adapted clones.

Abstract: Summary
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries that can lead to thrombosis, infarction, and stroke and is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Immunization of pro-atherogenic mice with malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) neo-antigen is athero-protective. However, the immune response to MDA-LDL and the mechanisms responsible for this athero-protection are not completely understood. Here, we find that immunization of mice with MDA-LDL elicits memory B cells, plasma cells, and switched anti-MDA-LDL antibodies as well as clonal expansion and affinity maturation, indicating that MDA-LDL triggers a bona fide germinal center antibody response. Further, Prdm1fl/fl Aicda-Cre+/ki Ldlr−/− pro-atherogenic chimeras, which lack germinal center-derived plasma cells, show accelerated atherosclerosis. Finally, we show that MDA-LDL immunization is not athero-protective in mice lacking germinal-center-derived plasma cells. Our findings give further support to the development of MDA-LDL-based vaccines for the prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
While intermittent fasting is a safe strategy to benefit health, it remains unclear whether a “timer” exists in vivo to record fasting duration and trigger a transcriptional switch. Here, we map a circadian transcriptional pathway atlas from 600 samples across four metabolic tissues of mice under five feeding regimens. Results show that 95.6% of detected canonical pathways are rhythmic in a tissue-specific and feeding-regimen-specific manner, while only less than 25% of them induce changes in transcriptional function. Fasting for 16 h initiates a circadian resonance of 43 pathways in the liver, and the resonance punctually switches following refeeding. The hepatic proteasome coordinates the resonance, and most genes encoding proteasome subunits display a 16-h fasting-dependent transcriptional switch. These findings indicate that the hepatic proteasome may serve as a fasting timer and a coordinator of pathway transcriptional resonance, which provide a target for revealing the underlying mechanism of intermittent fasting.

Abstract: Summary
Dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We previously showed that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) in mice induces gut dysbiosis, social dysfunction, and underlying synaptic plasticity deficits in male offspring (F1). Here, we reason that, if HFD-mediated changes in maternal gut microbiota drive offspring social deficits, then MHFD-induced dysbiosis in F1 female MHFD offspring would likewise impair F2 social behavior. Metataxonomic sequencing reveals reduced microbial richness among female F1 MHFD offspring. Despite recovery of microbial richness among MHFD-descendant F2 mice, they display social dysfunction. Post-weaning Limosilactobacillus reuteri treatment increases the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa and rescues MHFD-descendant F2 social deficits. L. reuteri exerts a sexually dimorphic impact on gut microbiota configuration, increasing discriminant taxa between female cohorts. Collectively, these results show multigenerational impacts of HFD-induced dysbiosis in the maternal lineage and highlight the potential of maternal microbiome-targeted interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of energy level to drive movements and material exchange with the environment is a basic principle of life. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses energy level and is a major regulator of cellular energy responses. The gamma subunit of AMPK senses elevated ratio of AMP to ATP and allosterically activates the alpha catalytic subunit to phosphorylate downstream effectors. Here, we report that knockout of AMPKγ, but not AMPKα, suppressed phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) induced by energy starvation. We identified PPP6C as an AMPKγ-regulated phosphatase of eEF2. AMP-bound AMPKγ sequesters PPP6C, thereby blocking dephosphorylation of eEF2 and thus inhibiting translation elongation to preserve energy and to promote cell survival. Further phosphoproteomic analysis identified additional targets of PPP6C regulated by energy stress in an AMPKγ-dependent manner. Thus, AMPKγ senses cellular energy availability to regulate not only AMPKα kinase, but also PPP6C phosphatase and possibly other effectors.

Abstract: Summary
In animals and plants, Dicer enzymes collaborate with double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) proteins to convert precursor-microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into miRNA duplexes. We report six cryo-EM structures of Drosophila Dicer-1 that show how Dicer-1 and its partner Loqs‑PB cooperate (1) before binding pre-miRNA, (2) after binding and in a catalytically competent state, (3) after nicking one arm of the pre-miRNA, and (4) following complete dicing and initial product release. Our reconstructions suggest that pre-miRNA binds a rare, open conformation of the Dicer‑1⋅Loqs‑PB heterodimer. The Dicer-1 dsRBD and three Loqs‑PB dsRBDs form a tight belt around the pre-miRNA, distorting the RNA helix to place the scissile phosphodiester bonds in the RNase III active sites. Pre-miRNA cleavage shifts the dsRBDs and partially closes Dicer-1, which may promote product release. Our data suggest a model for how the Dicer‑1⋅Loqs‑PB complex affects a complete cycle of pre-miRNA recognition, stepwise endonuclease cleavage, and product release.

Abstract: Summary
Blood-vessel formation generates unique vascular patterns in each individual. The principles governing the apparent stochasticity of this process remain to be elucidated. Using mathematical methods, we find that the transition between two fundamental vascular morphogenetic programs—sprouting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling—is established by a shift of collective front-to-rear polarity of endothelial cells in the mouse retina. We demonstrate that the competition between biochemical (VEGFA) and mechanical (blood-flow-induced shear stress) cues controls this collective polarity shift. Shear stress increases tension at focal adhesions overriding VEGFA-driven collective polarization, which relies on tension at adherens junctions. We propose that vascular morphogenetic cues compete to regulate individual cell polarity and migration through tension shifts that translates into tissue-level emergent behaviors, ultimately leading to uniquely organized vascular patterns.

Abstract: Serine protease 2 (PRSS2) plays a pivotal role in tum or pathogenesis as a serine protease. In this paper, we investigated the expression and role of PRSS2 in gastric cancer (GC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to detect PRSS2 expression in GC tissues. The correlations between PRSS2 and clinicopathological variables and prognosis were analyzed. The effects of PRSS2 on gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation assay, migration and invasion test, and nude mouse experiment. We observed that the PRSS2 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in GC tissues, and PRSS2 expression was associated with GC N stage. Patients with high PRSS2 expression have a poor prognosis. Finally, the regulatory effect of PRSS2 on the biological behaviors of GC cells was assessed in GC cells transfected with lentiviral interference fragments of PRSS2. The results suggested that PRSS2 knockdown decreased the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells and downregulated MMP-9 expression. In summary, PRSS2 overexpression is associated with poor postoperative prognosis in GC patients and can be used as a potential biomarker to assess the prognosis of GC.

Abstract: Summary
Prevention or amelioration of declining β cell mass is a potential strategy to cure diabetes. Here, we report the pathways utilized by β cells to robustly replicate in response to acute insulin resistance induced by S961, a pharmacological insulin receptor antagonist. Interestingly, pathways that include CENP-A and the transcription factor E2F1 that are independent of insulin signaling and its substrates appeared to mediate S961-induced β cell multiplication. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of E2F1 blocks β-cell proliferation in S961-injected mice. Serum from S961-treated mice recapitulates replication of β cells in mouse and human islets in an E2F1-dependent manner. Co-culture of islets with adipocytes isolated from S961-treated mice enables β cells to duplicate, while E2F1 inhibition limits their growth even in the presence of adipocytes. These data suggest insulin resistance-induced proliferative signals from adipocytes activate E2F1, a potential therapeutic target, to promote β cell compensation.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of alternative splicing in prostate cancer is linked to transcriptional programs activated by AR, ERG, FOXA1, and MYC. Here, we show that FOXA1 functions as the primary orchestrator of alternative splicing dysregulation across 500 primary and metastatic prostate cancer transcriptomes. We demonstrate that FOXA1 binds to the regulatory regions of splicing-related genes, including HNRNPK and SRSF1. By controlling trans-acting factor expression, FOXA1 exploits an “exon definition” mechanism calibrating alternative splicing toward dominant isoform production. This regulation especially impacts splicing factors themselves and leads to a reduction of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-targeted isoforms. Inclusion of the NMD-determinant FLNA exon 30 by FOXA1-controlled oncogene SRSF1 promotes cell growth in vitro and predicts disease recurrence. Overall, we report a role for FOXA1 in rewiring the alternative splicing landscape in prostate cancer through a cascade of events from chromatin access, to splicing factor regulation, and, finally, to alternative splicing of exons influencing patient survival.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) facilitates cancer invasion and is initiated by mesenchyme-driving transcription factors and actin cytoskeletal assembly. We show a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear transport gradient of the EMT transcription factor Zeb1 toward sites of invasion in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), driven by the EMT inducer Tgfb, which is expressed in M2 polarized macrophages. We show that Zeb1 binds free actin monomers and RhoA in the cytoplasm to inhibit actin polymerization, blocking cell migration and Yap1 nuclear transport. Tgfb causes turnover of the scaffold protein Rassf1a, which targets RhoA. Release of this RhoA inhibition in response to Tgfb overcomes Zeb1’s block of cytoskeleton assembly and frees it for nuclear transport. A ZEB1 nuclear transport signature highlights EMT progression, identifies dedifferentiated invasive/metastatic human LUADs, and predicts survival. Blocking Zeb1 nuclear transport with a small molecule identified in this study inhibits cytoskeleton assembly, cell migration, Yap1 nuclear transport, EMT, and precancerous-to-malignant transition.

Abstract: Antigen receptor stimulation triggers cytosolic Ca2+ signals, which activate transcriptional and metabolic programs critical for immune function. B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement causes rapid cytosolic Ca2+ rise through the ubiquitous store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway. Slc8b1, which encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), extrudes Ca2+ out of the mitochondria and maintains optimal SOCE activity. Inhibition of NCLX in DT40 and A20 B lymphocyte lines was recently shown to impair cytosolic Ca2+ transients in response to antigen-receptor stimulation, however the downstream functional consequences of this impairment remain unclear. Here, we generated Slc8b1 knockout A20 B-cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and B-cell specific Slc8b1 knockout mice. Surprisingly, while loss of Slc8b1 in B lymphocytes led to reduction in SOCE, it had a marginal effect on mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion, suggesting that NCLX is not the major mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in B cells. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content and rates of ER depletion and refilling remained unaltered in Slc8b1 knockout B cells. Slc8b1 deficiency increased mitochondrial production of oxidants, reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics and altered mitochondrial ultrastructure. B-cell specific Slc8b1 knockout mice showed reduced germinal center B cell responses following foreign antigen and pathogen driven immune responses. Our studies provide novel insights into the function of Slc8b1 in germinal center B cells and its contribution to B-cell signaling and effector function.

Abstract: Summary
Morphological and gene expression profiling can cost-effectively capture thousands of features in thousands of samples across perturbations by disease, mutation, or drug treatments, but it is unclear to what extent the two modalities capture overlapping versus complementary information. Here, using both the L1000 and Cell Painting assays to profile gene expression and cell morphology, respectively, we perturb human A549 lung cancer cells with 1,327 small molecules from the Drug Repurposing Hub across six doses, providing a data resource including dose-response data from both assays. The two assays capture both shared and complementary information for mapping cell state. Cell Painting profiles from compound perturbations are more reproducible and show more diversity but measure fewer distinct groups of features. Applying unsupervised and supervised methods to predict compound mechanisms of action (MOAs) and gene targets, we find that the two assays not only provide a partially shared but also a complementary view of drug mechanisms. Given the numerous applications of profiling in biology, our analyses provide guidance for planning experiments that profile cells for detecting distinct cell types, disease phenotypes, and response to chemical or genetic perturbations.

Abstract: Summary
The phylum Actinobacteria includes important human pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae and renowned producers of secondary metabolites of commercial interest, yet only a small part of its diversity is represented by sequenced genomes. Here, we present 824 actinobacterial isolate genomes in the context of a phylum-wide analysis of 6,700 genomes including public isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). We estimate that only 30%–50% of projected actinobacterial phylogenetic diversity possesses genomic representation via isolates and MAGs. A comparison of gene functions reveals novel determinants of host-microbe interaction as well as environment-specific adaptations such as potential antimicrobial peptides. We identify plasmids and prophages across isolates and uncover extensive prophage diversity structured mainly by host taxonomy. Analysis of >80,000 biosynthetic gene clusters reveals that horizontal gene transfer and gene loss shape secondary metabolite repertoire across taxa. Our observations illustrate the essential role of and need for high-quality isolate genome sequences.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, mediated by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, regulates oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Previous studies suggest that non-neuronal uniporters are exclusively regulated by a MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer. Here, we show that skeletal-muscle and kidney uniporters also complex with a MICU1-MICU1 homodimer and that human/mouse cardiac uniporters are largely devoid of MICUs. Cells employ protein-importation machineries to fine-tune the relative abundance of MICU1 homo- and heterodimers and utilize a conserved MICU intersubunit disulfide to protect properly assembled dimers from proteolysis by YME1L1. Using the MICU1 homodimer or removing MICU1 allows mitochondria to more readily take up Ca2+ so that cells can produce more ATP in response to intracellular Ca2+ transients. However, the trade-off is elevated ROS, impaired basal metabolism, and higher susceptibility to death. These results provide mechanistic insights into how tissues can manipulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake properties to support their unique physiological functions.

Abstract: Summary
The Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) is a population-based cohort of ∼229,000 individuals recruited in four waves beginning in 1984 in Trøndelag County, Norway. Approximately 88,000 of these individuals have available genetic data from array genotyping. HUNT participants were recruited during four community-based recruitment waves and provided information on health-related behaviors, self-reported diagnoses, family history of disease, and underwent physical examinations. Linkage via the Norwegian personal identification number integrates digitized health care information from doctor visits and national health registries including death, cancer and prescription registries. Genome-wide association studies of HUNT participants have provided insights into the mechanism of cardiovascular, metabolic, osteoporotic, and liver-related diseases, among others. Unique features of this cohort that facilitate research include nearly 40 years of longitudinal follow-up in a motivated and well-educated population, family data, comprehensive phenotyping, and broad availability of DNA, RNA, urine, fecal, plasma, and serum samples.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by extensive microvascular hyperproliferation. In addition to supplying blood to the tumor, GBM vessels also provide trophic support to glioma cells and serve as conduits for migration into the surrounding brain, promoting recurrence. Here, we enrich CD31-expressing glioma vascular cells (GVCs) and A2B5-expressing glioma tumor cells (GTCs) from primary GBM and use RNA sequencing to create a comprehensive molecular interaction map of the secreted and extracellular factors elaborated by GVCs that can interact with receptors and membrane molecules on GTCs. To validate our findings, we utilize functional assays, including a hydrogel-based migration assay and in vivo mouse models to demonstrate that one identified factor, the little-studied integrin binding sialoprotein (IBSP), enhances tumor growth and promotes the migration of GTCs along the vasculature. This perivascular niche interactome will serve as a resource to the research community in defining the potential functions of the GBM vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
Respiratory tract infections are among the deadliest communicable diseases worldwide. Severe cases of viral lung infections are often associated with a cytokine storm and alternating platelet numbers. We report that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sense a non-systemic influenza A virus (IAV) infection via inflammatory cytokines. Irrespective of antiviral treatment or vaccination, at a certain threshold of IAV titer in the lung, CD41-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enter the cell cycle while endothelial protein C receptor-positive CD41-negative HSCs remain quiescent. Active CD41-positive HSCs represent the source of megakaryocytes, while their multi-lineage reconstitution potential is reduced. This emergency megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin independent and attenuated in IAV-infected interleukin-1 receptor-deficient mice. Newly produced platelets during IAV infection are immature and hyper-reactive. After viral clearance, HSC quiescence is re-established. Our study reveals that non-systemic viral respiratory infection has an acute impact on HSCs via inflammatory cytokines to counteract IAV-induced thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma is a deadly form of cancer characterized by remarkable therapy resistance. Analyzing the transcriptome of MAPK inhibitor sensitive- and resistant-melanoma, we discovered that APAF-1 is negatively regulated by MITF in resistant tumors. This study identifies the MITF/APAF-1 axis as a molecular driver of MAPK inhibitor resistance. A drug-repositioning screen identified quinacrine and methylbenzethonium as potent activators of apoptosis in a context that mimics drug resistance mediated by APAF-1 inactivation. The compounds showed anti-tumor activity in in vitro and in vivo models, linked to suppression of MITF function. Both drugs profoundly sensitize melanoma cells to MAPK inhibitors, regulating key signaling networks in melanoma, including the MITF/APAF-1 axis. Significant activity of the two compounds in inhibiting specific epigenetic modulators of MITF/APAF-1 expression, such as histone deacetylases, was observed. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting the MITF/APAF-1 axis may overcome resistance and could be exploited as a potential therapeutic approach to treat resistant melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are associated with the aggregation and propagation of specific pathogenic protein species (e.g., Aβ, α-synuclein). However, whether disruption of synaptic homeostasis results from protein misfolding per se rather than accumulation of a specific rogue protein is an unexplored question. Here, we show that error-prone translation, with its frequent outcome of random protein misfolding, is sufficient to recapitulate many early features of NDDs, including perturbed Ca2+ signaling, neuronal hyperexcitability, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mice expressing the ribosomal ambiguity mutation Rps9 D95N exhibited disrupted synaptic homeostasis resulting in behavioral changes reminiscent of early Alzheimer disease (AD), such as learning and memory deficits, maladaptive emotional responses, epileptiform discharges, suppressed circadian rhythmicity, and sleep fragmentation, accompanied by hippocampal NPY expression and cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Collectively, our findings suggest that random protein misfolding may contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related NDDs, providing an alternative framework for understanding the initiation of AD.

Abstract: Summary
The use of alternative promoters, splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) generates mRNA isoforms that expand the diversity and complexity of the transcriptome. Here, we uncovered thousands of previously undescribed 5′ uncapped and polyadenylated transcripts (5′ UPTs). We show that these transcripts resist exonucleases due to a highly structured RNA and N6-methyladenosine modification at their 5′ termini. 5′ UPTs appear downstream of APA sites within their host genes and are induced upon APA activation. Strong enrichment in polysomal RNA fractions indicates 5′ UPT translational potential. Indeed, APA promotes downstream translation initiation, non-canonical protein output, and consistent changes to peptide presentation at the cell surface. Lastly, we demonstrate the biological importance of 5′ UPTs using Bcl2, a prominent anti-apoptotic gene whose entire coding sequence is a 5′ UPT generated from 5′ UTR-embedded APA sites. Thus, APA is not only accountable for terminating transcripts, but also for generating downstream uncapped RNAs with translation potential and biological impact.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator (MED) is a conserved factor with important roles in basal and activated transcription. Here, we investigate the genome-wide roles of yeast MED by rapid depletion of its activator-binding domain (Tail) and monitoring changes in nascent transcription. Rapid Tail depletion surprisingly reduces transcription from only a small subset of genes. At most of these Tail-dependent genes, in unperturbed conditions, MED is detected at both the UASs and promoters. In contrast, at most Tail-independent genes, we find MED primarily at promoters but not at the UASs. These results suggest that MED Tail and activator-mediated MED recruitment regulates only a small subset of genes. Furthermore, we define three classes of genes that differ in PIC assembly pathways and the requirements for MED Tail, SAGA, TFIID, and BET factors Bdf1/2. Our combined results have broad implications for the roles of MED, other coactivators, and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation at different gene classes.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind cognate DNA motif sequences in cis-regulatory elements (CREs). The combinations of DNA motifs acting within homeostasis and disease, however, are unclear. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated and a random-forest-based model was applied to identify 7,531 cell-type-specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across 15 diploid human cell types. A co-enrichment framework within CRMs nominated 838 cell-type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Cancer cells engaged DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes operative in normal cells while also activating new DMCs only seen in the neoplastic state. This integrative approach identifies cell-type-specific cis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motifs in diverse normal and diseased human cells and represents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory sequence logic in gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) require co-operation of innate and adaptive immune cells, which influence tumor progression and immunotherapy. Caspase-activated gasdermins facilitate tumor death and promote anti-tumor immunity. How pyroptosis in immune cells affects the TME remains unclear. TME expression of gasdermin D (GSDMD) is highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and correlates with immune checkpoint signatures. Through conditional deletion of GSDMD, we demonstrate that GSDMD in TME APCs restricts anti-tumor immunity during PD-L1 inhibition. Loss of GSDMD in APCs enhances interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby promoting CD8+ T cell activation in a cGAS-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and PD-L1 improve anti-tumor immunity, highlighting the potential of combining GSDMD/PD-L1 inhibition for immunotherapy as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Innate immunity is an ancestral process that can induce pro- and anti-inflammatory states. A major challenge is to characterize transcriptional cascades that modulate the response to inflammation. Since the Drosophila glial cells missing (Gcm) transcription factor has an anti-inflammatory role, we explored its regulation and evolutionary conservation. Here, we show that the murine Gcm2 (mGcm2) gene is expressed in a subpopulation of aged microglia (chronic inflammation) and upon lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced central nervous system (CNS) demyelination (acute inflammation). Moreover, mGcm2 conditional knockout mice show an increased inflammatory phenotype upon aging or LPC injection, and hGCM2 is expressed in active demyelinating lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis. Finally, Drosophila Gcm expression is induced upon aging and acute challenge, and its overexpression decreases the inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, these data indicate that the inducible Gcm cascade is conserved from flies to humans and represents a potential therapeutic target in the control of the inflammatory response.

Abstract: Summary
The pause-release model of transcription proposes that 40–100 bases from the start site RNA Pol II pauses, followed by release into productive elongation. Pause release is facilitated by the PTEFb phosphorylation of the RNA Pol II elongation factor, Spt5. We mapped paused polymerases by eNET-seq and found frequent pausing in zones that extend ∼0.3–3 kb into genes even when PTEFb is inhibited. The fraction of paused polymerases or pausing propensity declines gradually over several kb and not abruptly as predicted for a discrete pause-release event. Spt5 depletion extends pausing zones, suggesting that it promotes the maturation of elongation complexes to a low-pausing state. The expression of mutants after Spt5 depletion showed that phosphomimetic substitutions in the CTR1 domain diminished pausing throughout genes. By contrast, mutants that prevent the phosphorylation of the Spt5 RNA-binding domain strengthened pausing. Thus, distinct Spt5 phospho-isoforms set the balance between pausing and elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Low-dose human interleukin-2 (hIL-2) treatment is used clinically to treat autoimmune disorders due to the cytokine’s preferential expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, off-target immune cell activation and short serum half-life limit the clinical potential of IL-2 treatment. Recent work showed that complexes comprising hIL-2 and the anti-hIL-2 antibody F5111 overcome these limitations by preferentially stimulating Tregs over immune effector cells. Although promising, therapeutic translation of this approach is complicated by the need to optimize dosing ratios and by the instability of the cytokine/antibody complex. We leverage structural insights to engineer a single-chain hIL-2/F5111 antibody fusion protein, termed F5111 immunocytokine (IC), which potently and selectively activates and expands Tregs. F5111 IC confers protection in mouse models of colitis and checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus. These results provide a roadmap for IC design and establish a Treg-biased immunotherapy that could be clinically translated for autoimmune disease treatment.

Abstract: Summary
BRAF is frequently mutated in human cancer and the RASopathy syndromes, with RASopathy mutations often observed in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Although the CRD participates in phosphatidylserine (PS) binding, the RAS-RAF interaction, and RAF autoinhibition, the impact of these activities on RAF function in normal and disease states is not well characterized. Here, we analyze a panel of CRD mutations and show that they increase BRAF activity by relieving autoinhibition and/or enhancing PS binding, with relief of autoinhibition being the major factor determining mutation severity. Further, we show that CRD-mediated autoinhibition prevents the constitutive plasma membrane localization of BRAF that causes increased RAS-dependent and RAS-independent function. Comparison of the BRAF- and CRAF-CRDs also indicates that the BRAF-CRD is a stronger mediator of autoinhibition and PS binding, and given the increased catalytic activity of BRAF, our studies reveal a more critical role for CRD-mediated autoinhibition in BRAF regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Recent work showed that the dominant post-menopausal estrogen, estrone, cooperates with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to stimulate inflammation, while pre-menopausal 17β-estradiol opposes NF-κB. Here, we show that post-menopausal estrone, but not 17β-estradiol, activates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes to stimulate breast cancer metastasis. HSD17B14, which converts 17β-estradiol to estrone, is higher in cancer than normal breast tissue and in metastatic than primary cancers and associates with earlier metastasis. Treatment with estrone, but not 17β-estradiol, and HSD17B14 overexpression both stimulate an EMT, matrigel invasion, and lung, bone, and liver metastasis in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer models, while HSD17B14 knockdown reverses the EMT. Estrone:ERα recruits CBP/p300 to the SNAI2 promoter to induce SNAI2 and stimulate an EMT, while 17β-estradiol:ERα recruits co-repressors HDAC1 and NCOR1 to this site. Present work reveals novel differences in gene regulation by these estrogens and the importance of estrone to ER+ breast cancer progression. Upon loss of 17β-estradiol at menopause, estrone-liganded ERα would promote ER+ breast cancer invasion and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular fate after infection with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is typically death. Previous data suggest, however, that the transcriptional state of an individual cell may sometimes allow additional outcomes of infection. Here, to probe the range of interactions a permissive cell type can have with a HCoV, we perform a CRISPR activation screen with HCoV-229E. The screen identified the transcription factor ZBTB7A, which strongly promotes cell survival after infection. Rather than suppressing viral infection, ZBTB7A upregulation allows the virus to induce a persistent infection and homeostatic state with the cell. We also find that control of oxidative stress is a primary driver of cellular survival during HCoV-229E infection. These data illustrate that, in addition to the nature of the infecting virus and the type of cell that it encounters, the cellular gene expression profile prior to infection can affect the eventual fate.

Abstract: Summary
Asthma is a complex disease that varies widely in prevalence across populations. The extent to which genetic variation contributes to these disparities is unclear, as the genetics underlying asthma have been investigated primarily in populations of European descent. As part of the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative, we conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study of asthma (153,763 cases and 1,647,022 controls) via meta-analysis across 22 biobanks spanning multiple ancestries. We discovered 179 asthma-associated loci, 49 of which were not previously reported. Despite the wide range in asthma prevalence among biobanks, we found largely consistent genetic effects across biobanks and ancestries. The meta-analysis also improved polygenic risk prediction in non-European populations compared with previous studies. Additionally, we found considerable genetic overlap between age-of-onset subtypes and between asthma and comorbid diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most frequent and lethal malignancies in the world. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression is limited. Here, we generate a series of primary GC models in mice with genome-edited gastric organoids, which elucidate the genetic drivers for sequential transformation from dysplasia to well-differentiated and poorly differentiated GC. Further, we find that the orthotopic GC, but not the subcutaneous GC even with the same genetic drivers, display remote metastasis, suggesting critical roles of the microenvironment in GC metastasis. Through single-cell RNA-seq analyses and functional studies, we show that the interaction between fibronectin 1 on stomach-specific macrophages and integrin a6β4 on GC cells promotes remote metastases. Taken together, our studies propose a strategy to model GC and dissect the genetic and microenvironmental factors driving the full-range gastric tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Background and objective
Renal tissue injuries by free radicals are an essential reason in pathogenesis of urinary tract stones. Ethylene glycol is one of the toxic agents which can causes to the increases in biosynthesis of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress condition. Natural antioxidants have been reported to protective efficacy against renal stones formation. Accordingly, the aim of the current experiment was to identify the renal protective effect of chlorogenic acid as a well-prominent antioxidant on ethylene glycol-induced renal stone model targeting the NFKB-RUNX2-AP1-OSTERIX signaling pathway.
Materials and methods
Renal stones model were established by ethylene glycol (Percent: 0.75) within the daily drinking water for rats. Treatment groups received cystone (750 mg/kg) and chlorogenic acid (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, day: 15th to 28th, gavage). After 4 weeks, the renal function parameters (calcium, uric acid, creatinine, total protein, oxalate, and citrate) in plasma, urine, and renal tissue were measured. Moreover, oxidative stress factors and gene expression of NFKB, RUNX2, AP1, and OSTERIX were also evaluated.
Results
The results showed improved renal function in chlorogenic acid-treated groups. The total proteins and creatinine excretion were decreased. Also the gene expression of oxidative stress pathway (NFKB-RUNX2-AP1-OSTERIX) were decreased which caused to increases of antioxidant enzymes.
Conclusions
the antioxidant activity increases by chlorogenic acid treatment may have a critical role in prevention of calcium oxalate formation via inhibition of the NFKB-RUNX2-AP1-OSTERIX signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a hallmark of obesity-induced liver steatosis and contributes to the progress of steatosis and insulin resistance in liver. However, its influence on adipose function is still unclear. Here, we identify a hepatic ER stress-induced activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP)-angiopoietin-related protein3 (ANGPTL3) cascade critical for the regulation of adipose browning. We find that obesity increases CIRP expression in liver through ER stress-induced ATF4. CIRP in turn binds to the 3′ UTR and increases mRNA stability of ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 secreted from liver suppresses uncoupling protein 1 expression through integrin αvβ3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in adipose tissue. While hepatic expression of either ATF4, CIRP, or ANGPTL3 suppresses adipose browning, knockdown of CIRP and ANGPTL3 in liver or administration of integrin αvβ3 inhibitor cilengitide increases adipose browning process. Taken together, we identify a communication mechanism to link hepatic ER stress and adipose browning that may imply a reciprocal regulation of obesity and liver steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
The plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In this study, the gene that encodes a heme-binding protein in the pulmonary surfactant (PS) of the pika is identified. The protein is a homotetrameric hemoglobin (δ4) encoded by HBD (δ). HBD is expressed in alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) and type I (ATI) cells, upregulated by hypoxia. δ4 is secreted into alveolar cavities through osmiophilic multilamellar bodies. HBD expression is downregulated by RNAi, which significantly increases hypoxia-inducible factor 1α expression in lung tissue and red blood cells and hemoglobin and blood lactate concentrations but significantly decreases arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Our results indicate that plateau pikas physiologically show hypoxemia when HBD expression is downregulated. Therefore, specific HBD expression in the lungs helps plateau pikas to obtain oxygen under hypoxia by maintaining higher PaO2. These findings provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms of plateau pikas to withstand high-altitude environments.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that protein S-nitrosylation is enzymatically regulated and that specificity in S-nitrosylation derives from dedicated S-nitrosylases and denitrosylases that conjugate and remove S-nitrosothiols, respectively. Here, we report that mice deficient in the protein denitrosylase SCoR2 (S-nitroso-Coenzyme A Reductase 2; AKR1A1) exhibit marked reductions in serum cholesterol due to reduced secretion of the cholesterol-regulating protein PCSK9. SCoR2 associates with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory machinery to control an S-nitrosylation cascade involving ER cargo-selection proteins SAR1 and SURF4, which moonlight as S-nitrosylases. SAR1 acts as a SURF4 nitrosylase and SURF4 as a PCSK9 nitrosylase to inhibit PCSK9 secretion, while SCoR2 counteracts nitrosylase activity by promoting PCSK9 denitrosylation. Inhibition of PCSK9 by an NO-based drug requires nitrosylase activity, and small-molecule inhibition of SCoR2 phenocopies the PCSK9-mediated reductions in cholesterol observed in SCoR2-deficient mice. Our results reveal enzymatic machinery controlling cholesterol levels through S-nitrosylation and suggest a distinct treatment paradigm for cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau) in the brain is associated with cognitive and motor impairments, and ultimately neurodegeneration. We investigate how human pTau affects cells and network activity in the hippocampal formation of the THY-Tau22 tauopathy model mice in vivo. We find that pTau preferentially accumulates in deep-layer pyramidal neurons, leading to neurodegeneration, and we establish that pTau spreads to oligodendrocytes. During goal-directed virtual navigation in aged transgenic mice, we detect fewer high-firing prosubicular pyramidal cells, but the firing population retains its coupling to theta oscillations. Analysis of network oscillations and firing patterns of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons recorded in head-fixed and freely moving mice suggests preserved neuronal coordination. In spatial memory tests, transgenic mice have reduced short-term familiarity, but spatial working and reference memory are surprisingly normal. We hypothesize that unimpaired subcortical network mechanisms maintain cortical neuronal coordination, counteracting the widespread pTau aggregation, loss of high-firing cells, and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification and its modulators play critical roles and show promise as therapeutic targets in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IGF2BP2 was recently reported as an m6A binding protein that enhances mRNA stability and translation. However, its function in AML remains largely elusive. Here we report the oncogenic role and the therapeutic targeting of IGF2BP2 in AML. High expression of IGF2BP2 is observed in AML and associates with unfavorable prognosis. IGF2BP2 promotes AML development and self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiation cells by regulating expression of critical targets (e.g., MYC, GPT2, and SLC1A5) in the glutamine metabolism pathways in an m6A-dependent manner. Inhibiting IGF2BP2 with our recently identified small-molecule compound (CWI1-2) shows promising anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results reveal a role of IGF2BP2 and m6A modification in amino acid metabolism and highlight the potential of targeting IGF2BP2 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumoral heterogeneity is a seminal feature of human tumors contributing to tumor progression and response to treatment. Current technologies are still largely unsuitable to accurately track phenotypes and clonal evolution within tumors, especially in response to genetic manipulations. Here, we developed epitopes for imaging using combinatorial tagging (EpicTags), which we coupled to multiplexed ion beam imaging (EpicMIBI) for in situ tracking of barcodes within tissue microenvironments. Using EpicMIBI, we dissected the spatial component of cell lineages and phenotypes in xenograft models of small cell lung cancer. We observed emergent properties from mixed clones leading to the preferential expansion of clonal patches for both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancer cell states in these models. In a tumor model harboring a fraction of PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we observed a non-autonomous increase of clonal patch size in PTEN wild-type cancer cells. EpicMIBI facilitates in situ interrogation of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic processes involved in intratumoral heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly population with unclear pathogenic mechanism. Herein, we detect downregulated circSPECC1 expression in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of AMD patients. In RPE cells, circSPECC1 insufficiency leads to oxidative stress-induced ferroptosis, depolarization, and irregular lipid metabolism. Consistently, in mice, circSPECC1 deficiency induces visual impairments and RPE anomalies and interrupts retinal homeostasis. Mechanically, nuclear export of circSPECC1 transcript depends on its N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level with YTHDC1 as the reader. CircSPECC1 directly sponges miR-145-5p to block its interaction with CDKN1A. Overexpressing miR-145-5p aggravates RPE dysfunctions, mimicking circSPECC1 silencing effects. Retinal phenotypes induced by circSPECC1 insufficiency are alleviated by miR-145-5p inhibition and are aggravated by miR-145-5p overexpression. Collectively, circSPECC1, mediated by m6A modification and sponging miR-145-5p, resists oxidative stress injuries and maintains lipid metabolism in RPE. Pharmacological supplementation of circSPECC1 is a promising therapeutic option for atrophic retinopathies like AMD.

Abstract: Summary
Microorganisms are detected in multiple cancer types, including in putatively sterile organs, but the contexts in which they influence oncogenesis or anti-tumor responses in humans remain unclear. We recently developed single-cell analysis of host-microbiome interactions (SAHMI), a computational pipeline to recover and denoise microbial signals from single-cell sequencing of host tissues. Here we use SAHMI to interrogate tumor-microbiome interactions in two human pancreatic cancer cohorts. We identify somatic-cell-associated bacteria in a subset of tumors and their near absence in nonmalignant tissues. These bacteria predominantly pair with tumor cells, and their presence is associated with cell-type-specific gene expression and pathway activities, including cell motility and immune signaling. Modeling results indicate that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes closely resemble T cells from infected tissue. Finally, using multiple independent datasets, a signature of cell-associated bacteria predicts clinical prognosis. Tumor-microbiome crosstalk may modulate tumorigenesis in pancreatic cancer with implications for clinical management.

Abstract: Aims
This study aimed to evaluate the gastroduodenal protective action of crude fraction extracted from P. caribaeorum mucus in Wistar rats.
Main method
Initially, phytochemical screening was performed to measure secondary metabolites present in the extract. Subsequently, studies of gastroprotective action in Wistar rats were developed. The animals were randomly divided into six experimental groups: SF0.9% group, misoprostol group, and test groups (200, 100, 10, and 1 mg/kg) that received different doses of the crude fraction of zoanthid mucus (CFZM) diluted in SF0.9%. After 14 days of treatment, acute gastric ulcers were induced by gavage by administering aspirin (200 mg/kg). The stomach and duodenum were removed for histopathological and gene analysis of the mucosa.
Key findings
The present study found that all investigated metabolites showed negative results. The crude fraction showed a gastric and duodenal protective effect evidenced by an increase in the amount and production of mucins (MUC1 and MUC5AC) and mucus production area in the stomach. Histopathological analysis evidenced a decrease in epithelial damage in the duodenum, with a more significant extension of intestinal villi and a greater amount of goblet cells.
Significance
The crude fraction, extracted from P. caribaeorum, showed gastric and duodenal protective action and is not inert in murine gastroduodenal tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular chloride ion concentration ([Cl–]i) homeostasis is critical for excitatory/inhibitory balance and volume regulation in neurons. We quantitatively map spatiotemporal dendritic [Cl–]i dynamics during N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity to determine how Cl– changes contribute to localized dendritic swelling (blebbing) in stroke-like conditions. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology combined with simultaneous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of the Cl– dye N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAE; MQAE-FLIM) reliably report resting and dynamic [Cl–]i shifts in dendrites. NMDA application generates spatially restricted and persistent high [Cl–]i subdomains at dendritic blebs in a process that requires Ca2+ influx and the subsequent opening of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. We propose sustained and localized K+ efflux increased extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]o) sufficiently at discrete regions to reverse K+-Cl– cotransporter (KCC2) transport and trigger synaptic swelling. Together, our data establish a mechanism for KCC2 to generate pathological [Cl–]i microdomains in blebbing with relevance for multiple neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) fuel adult bone with stemness resources to maintain homeostasis and support regeneration, which depends on the precise determination of the osteogenic lineage commitment of SSCs. In this study, using Cre-loxP reporter lineage tracking, we identified and characterized a population of NFATc1+ SSCs in bone regeneration. Pre-existing NFATc1+ SSCs are involved in early bone callus formation. Subsequently, these NFATc1+ SSCs produce osteolineage descendants in the subsequent stages of regeneration. The Ca2+-triggered transcriptional activity of NFATc1 constitutes the pre-imprinted memory of the trajectory to intrinsically orchestrate osteogenesis of SSCs. Inhibition of Ca2+/NFATc1 signaling in SSCs directly impairs osteogenesis and bone regeneration. In summary, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of adult bone regeneration through the regulation of NFATc1+ SSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Mutational signature analysis is commonly performed in cancer genomic studies. Here, we present SigProfilerExtractor, an automated tool for de novo extraction of mutational signatures, and benchmark it against another 13 bioinformatics tools by using 34 scenarios encompassing 2,500 simulated signatures found in 60,000 synthetic genomes and 20,000 synthetic exomes. For simulations with 5% noise, reflecting high-quality datasets, SigProfilerExtractor outperforms other approaches by elucidating between 20% and 50% more true-positive signatures while yielding 5-fold less false-positive signatures. Applying SigProfilerExtractor to 4,643 whole-genome- and 19,184 whole-exome-sequenced cancers reveals four novel signatures. Two of the signatures are confirmed in independent cohorts, and one of these signatures is associated with tobacco smoking. In summary, this report provides a reference tool for analysis of mutational signatures, a comprehensive benchmarking of bioinformatics tools for extracting signatures, and several novel mutational signatures, including one putatively attributed to direct tobacco smoking mutagenesis in bladder tissues.

Abstract: Summary
To ensure successful offspring ploidy, vertebrate oocytes must halt the cell cycle in meiosis II until sperm entry. Emi2 is essential to keep oocytes arrested until fertilization. However, how this arrest is implemented exclusively in meiosis II and not prematurely in meiosis I has until now remained enigmatic. Using mouse and frog oocytes, we show here that cyclin B3, an understudied B-type cyclin, is essential to keep Emi2 levels low in meiosis I. Direct phosphorylation of Emi2 at an evolutionarily highly conserved site by Cdk1/cyclin B3 targets Emi2 for degradation. In contrast, Cdk1/cyclin B1 is inefficient in Emi2 phosphorylation, and this provides a molecular explanation for the requirement of different B-type cyclins for oocyte maturation. Cyclin B3 degradation at exit from meiosis I enables Emi2 accumulation and thus timely arrest in meiosis II. Our findings illuminate the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that control oocyte arrest for fertilization at the correct cell-cycle stage, which is essential for embryo viability.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I is an essential innate immune receptor for detecting and responding to infection by RNA viruses. RIG-I specifically recognizes the unique molecular features of viral RNA molecules and selectively distinguishes them from closely related RNAs abundant in host cells. The physical basis for this exquisite selectivity is revealed through a series of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of RIG-I in complex with host and viral RNA ligands. These studies demonstrate that RIG-I actively samples double-stranded RNAs in the cytoplasm and distinguishes them by adopting two different types of protein folds. Upon binding viral RNA, RIG-I adopts a high-affinity conformation that is conducive to signaling, while host RNA induces an autoinhibited conformation that stimulates RNA release. By coupling protein folding with RNA binding selectivity, RIG-I distinguishes RNA molecules that differ by as little as one phosphate group, thereby explaining the molecular basis for selective antiviral sensing and the induction of autoimmunity upon RIG-I dysregulation.

To declare the biochemical, histopathological and ultrastructural impact of electronic cigarette exposure on the tissues of respiratory passage.
Material and methods
Twenty adult male Wistar albino rats were allocated into two groups of 10 animals in each; group I as control group and group II which was exposed to 1 ml/day for one hour of E-liquid involving (18 mg/ml nicotine) for 5 sequential days/ week for 4 weeks. Assessment of markers of oxidative stress; malondialdehyde (MDA) & total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was performed. Specimens of their larynxes and lungs were subjected to histopathological examination with light microscopy (H&E, toluidine blue and orcein stain) with histopathological injury scoring, electron microscopic, histo-morphometric, and immune-histochemical studies of protein α-SMA, p53 and ki-67
Results
E-liquid vapors exposed rats exhibited a significant elevation of MDA and suppression in TAC levels in comparison with the control group in all respiratory pathway organs. Microscopic analysis of respiratory epithelium of exposed group revealed hyperplasia, loss of their cilia and vascular dilatation in lamina propria while the lung examination showed thickened alveolar septa, inflammatory infiltrate and congested thick wall blood vessels. The bronchus was lined with multilayered dark stained nuclei epithelium, and there were thickened irregular smooth muscle fibers. Morphometric analysis revealed increase of area percent of elastic fibers in experimental rats’ lungs. Increase of α-SMA and P53 immuno-expression but decrease of Ki-67 immuno-expression in exposed groups were observed when compared to control. Ultrastructural examination showed cilial loss in respiratory epithelium with shrunken type 1 & 2 alveolar cells, with cytoplasmic vacuolations, atypical lamellar bodies and shrunken nuclei. Significant increase of the score of histopathological injury in larynx and lung.
Conclusion
Exposure to e-liquid with nicotine induces oxidative stress and has adverse impact on respiratory pathway including histo-pathological and ultrastructural disorganization of respiratory epithelium and lung tissues.

Abstract: Summary
We show that a gene (CpGap1) encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica is differentially expressed by Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV1) infection. Functional analysis using a CpGap1-null mutant results in no observed changes in cultural morphology other than hypersensitivity to ROS. Analysis of the protein product of the CpGap1 gene (CpGAP1) confirmed motifs with antioxidizing properties. The virulence of the CpGap1-null mutant is significantly decreased, and phytotoxic activity is seen in the peptides of CpGAP1. CHV1 transfer to the CpGap1-null mutant results in severely retarded colonial growth, and virus-titer is significantly increased in the mycelia of CHV1-infected CpGap1-null mutant. These results indicate that CpGAP1 functions as a protective barrier against plant defenses, but also acts as a virulence factor. Moreover, our study demonstrates that the CpGap1 gene is a host-tolerating antiviral factor that helps maintain fungal growth and suppress viral titer after CHV1 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNTs) represent a spectrum of neural-crest-derived tumors, including neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma. Malignant cells in PNTs are theorized to interconvert between adrenergic/noradrenergic and mesenchymal/neural crest cell states. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of 10 PNTs demonstrates extensive transcriptomic heterogeneity. Trajectory modeling suggests that malignant neuroblasts move between adrenergic and mesenchymal cell states via an intermediate state that we term “transitional.” Transitional cells express programs linked to a sympathoadrenal development and aggressive tumor phenotypes such as rapid proliferation and tumor dissemination. Among primary bulk tumor patient cohorts, high expression of the transitional gene signature is predictive of poor prognosis compared with adrenergic and mesenchymal expression patterns. High transitional gene expression in neuroblastoma cell lines identifies a similar transitional H3K27-acetylation super-enhancer landscape. Collectively, our study supports the concept that PNTs have phenotypic plasticity and uncovers potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle is populated with a reservoir of quiescent muscle stem cells (MuSCs), which regenerate the tissue after injury. Here, we show that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr116 is essential for long-term maintenance of the MuSC pool. Quiescent MuSCs express high levels of Gpr116, which is rapidly downregulated upon MuSC activation. MuSCs deficient for Gpr116 exhibit progressive depletion over time and are defective in self-renewal. Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors contain an agonistic peptide sequence, called the “Stachel” sequence, within their long N-terminal ectodomains. Stimulation of MuSCs with the GPR116 Stachel peptide delays MuSC activation and differentiation. Stachel peptide stimulation of GPR116 leads to strong interaction with β-arrestins. Stimulation of GPR116 increases the nuclear localization of β-arrestin1, where it interacts with cAMP response element binding protein to regulate gene expression. Altogether, we propose a model by which GPR116 maintains the MuSC pool via nuclear functions of β-arrestin1.

Abstract: Summary
Contagious itch behavior informs conspecifics of adverse environment and is crucial for the survival of social animals. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its receptor (GRPR) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus mediates contagious itch behavior in mice. Here, we show that intrinsically photosensitive retina ganglion cells (ipRGCs) convey visual itch information, independently of melanopsin, from the retina to GRP neurons via PACAP-PAC1R signaling. Moreover, GRPR neurons relay itch information to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT). Surprisingly, neither the visual cortex nor superior colliculus is involved in contagious itch. In vivo calcium imaging and extracellular recordings reveal contagious itch-specific neural dynamics of GRPR neurons. Thus, we propose that the retina-ipRGC-SCN-PVT pathway constitutes a previously unknown visual pathway that probably evolved for motion vision that encodes salient environmental cues and enables animals to imitate behaviors of conspecifics as an anticipatory mechanism to cope with adverse conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Cells possess several conserved adaptive mechanisms to respond to stress. Stress signaling is initiated to reestablish cellular homeostasis, but its effects on the tissue or systemic levels are far less understood. We report that the secreted luminal domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer CREB3L2 (which we name TAILS [transmissible activator of increased cell livability under stress]) is an endogenous, cell non-autonomous activator of neuronal resilience. In response to oxidative insults, neurons secrete TAILS, which potentiates hedgehog signaling through direct interaction with Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and its receptor PTCH1, leading to improved antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial function in neighboring neurons. In an in vivo model of ischemic brain injury, administration of TAILS enables survival of CNS neurons and fully preserves cognitive function in behavioral tests. Our findings reveal an SHH-mediated, cell non-autonomous branch of cellular stress signaling that confers resilience to oxidative stress in the mature brain, providing protection from ischemic neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient sensing and damage sensing are two fundamental processes in living organisms. While hyperglycemia is frequently linked to diabetes-related vulnerability to microbial infection, how body glucose levels affect innate immune responses to microbial invasion is not fully understood. Here, we surprisingly found that viral infection led to a rapid and dramatic decrease in blood glucose levels in rodents, leading to robust AMPK activation. AMPK, once activated, directly phosphorylates TBK1 at S511, which triggers IRF3 recruitment and the assembly of MAVS or STING signalosomes. Consistently, ablation or inhibition of AMPK, knockin of TBK1-S511A, or increased glucose levels compromised nucleic acid sensing, while boosting AMPK-TBK1 cascade by AICAR or TBK1-S511E knockin improves antiviral immunity substantially in various animal models. Thus, we identify TBK1 as an AMPK substrate, reveal the molecular mechanism coupling a dual sensing of glucose and nuclei acids, and report its physiological necessity in antiviral defense.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease, and CD4+ T cells are known to promote SLE development. Here, we explore heterogeneities in the CD4+ T cell regulome and their associations with SLE pathogenesis by performing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and single-cell transcriptome sequencing (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) of peripheral CD4+ T cells from 72 SLE patients and 30 healthy controls. Chromatin accessibility signatures of CD4+ T cells are correlated with disease severity. Further, we generate 34,176 single-cell transcriptomes of healthy and SLE CD4+ T cells and reveal transcriptional dysfunction of regulatory T (Treg) cells, identifying two Treg subpopulations, among which the CCR7lowCD74hi Treg subgroup features type I interferon-induced functional exhaustion in SLE patients. These transcriptome-level findings for SLE Tregs are mirrored in trends from the ATAC-seq data. Our study establishes a rich empirical foundation for understanding SLE and uncovers previously unknown contributions of Treg with exhaustion-like properties to SLE pathogenesis.

Abstract: Background
To explore the regulatory effect of serine/arginine repetitive matrix 1 (SRRM1) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential pathway.
Methods
SRRM1 level in the tissue was tested by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were tested by EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and Transwell, respectively. The potential mechanism of SRRM1 was explored through GSEA enrichment analysis and GeneMANIA protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect PPI. Levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Cleaved caspase 3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 were tested by Western blot. SRRM1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues, and was related to the survival and prognosis of patients.
Results
SRRM1 is significantly upregulated in HCC tumour tissues and correlated with progression of HCC. Overexpression of SRRM1 accelerated the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, and inhibited cell apoptosis, but low expression of SRRM1 had the opposite effect. SRRM1 positively correlated with the expression of IL6ST (GP130) and activated the JAK/STAT signaling pathways. SRRM1 affected the level of key molecules p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3, and STAT3 in the JAK/STAT pathway.
Conclusion
SRRM1 played a significant role in the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of HCC, and promoted cancer by regulating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The structural and functional organization of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) remains intensely debated. Here, we show the co-existence of two separate MRC organizations in human cells and postmitotic tissues, C-MRC and S-MRC, defined by the preferential expression of three COX7A subunit isoforms, COX7A1/2 and SCAFI (COX7A2L). COX7A isoforms promote the functional reorganization of distinct co-existing MRC structures to prevent metabolic exhaustion and MRC deficiency. Notably, prevalence of each MRC organization is reversibly regulated by the activation state of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Under oxidative conditions, the C-MRC is bioenergetically more efficient, whereas the S-MRC preferentially maintains oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) upon metabolic rewiring toward glycolysis. We show a link between the metabolic signatures converging at the PDC and the structural and functional organization of the MRC, challenging the widespread notion of the MRC as a single functional unit and concluding that its structural heterogeneity warrants optimal adaptation to metabolic function.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cell divisions are coordinated with cell loss to preserve epithelial integrity. However, how epithelia adapt their rate of cell division to changes in cell number, for instance during homeostatic turnover or wounding, is not well understood. Here, we show that epithelial cells sense local cell density through mechanosensitive E-cadherin adhesions to control G2/M cell-cycle progression. As local cell density increases, tensile forces on E-cadherin adhesions are reduced, which prompts the accumulation of the G2 checkpoint kinase Wee1 and downstream inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1. Consequently, dense epithelia contain a pool of cells that are temporarily halted in G2 phase. These cells are readily triggered to divide following epithelial wounding due to the consequent increase in intercellular forces and resulting degradation of Wee1. Our data collectively show that epithelial cell division is controlled by a mechanical G2 checkpoint, which is regulated by cell-density-dependent intercellular forces sensed and transduced by E-cadherin adhesions.

Abstract: Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl) and Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) can change the biochemical and biophysical properties of dentin. However, the response of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) to NaOCl and EDTA-treated dentin remains unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of NaOCl and EDTA on cell proliferation, osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation, and the response to mechanosensitive gene expression in hDPSCs. Dentin slices were treated with 5.25% NaOCl, 17% EDTA, and saline (0.9% NaCl) separately. The cell viability and osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, cell counting assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Besides, the hardness was measured by a Vickers microhardness tester. The expression of mechanosensitive genes was detected by the qPCR assay. All the irrigant-treated dentin allowed cell attachment. The EDTA-treated dentin significantly boosted the ALP and osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation, followed by NaCl and NaOCl groups. Remarkably, these trends were similar to the expression of mechanosensitive genes but were different from the trends of hardness values. The effect of irrigant-treated dentin on regulating hDPSCs differentiation might correlate with mechanosensitive signals. Whereas, the hardness changes between groups might not produce significant roles in regulating osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation of stem cells on dentin surfaces.

Abstract: Summary
The signaling mechanisms neurons use to modulate myelination of circuits in the central nervous system (CNS) are only partly understood. Through analysis of isoform-specific neuregulin1 (nrg1) mutants in zebrafish, we demonstrate that nrg1 type II is an important regulator of myelination of two classes of spinal cord interneurons. Surprisingly, nrg1 type II expression is prominent in unmyelinated Rohon-Beard sensory neurons, whereas myelination of neighboring interneurons is reduced in nrg1 type II mutants. Cell-type-specific loss-of-function studies indicate that nrg1 type II is required in Rohon-Beard neurons to signal to other neurons, not oligodendrocytes, to modulate spinal cord myelination. Together, our data support a model in which unmyelinated neurons express Nrg1 type II proteins to regulate myelination of neighboring neurons, a mode of action that may coordinate the functions of unmyelinated and myelinated neurons in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
We identify ADIRF-AS1 circadian long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Deletion of ADIRF-AS1 in U2OS cells alters rhythmicity of clock-controlled genes and expression of extracellular matrix genes. ADIRF-AS1 interacts with all components of the PBAF (PBRM1/BRG1) complex in U2OS cells. Because PBRM1 is a tumor suppressor mutated in over 40% of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) cases, we evaluate ADIRF-AS1 in ccRCC cells. Reducing ADIRF-AS1 expression in ccRCC cells decreases expression of some PBAF-suppressed genes. Expression of these genes is partially rescued by PBRM1 loss, consistent with ADIRF-AS1 acting in part to modulate PBAF. ADIRF-AS1 expression correlates with survival in human ccRCC, particularly in PBRM1 wild-type, but not mutant, tumors. Loss of ADIRF-AS1 eliminates in vivo tumorigenesis, partially rescued by concurrent loss of PBRM1 only when co-injected with Matrigel, suggesting a PBRM1-independent function of ADIRF-AS1. Our findings suggest that ADIRF-AS1 functions partly through PBAF to regulate specific genes as a BMAL1-CLOCK-regulated, oncogenic lncRNA.

Abstract: Summary
Concurrent mutation of a RAS oncogene and the tumor suppressor p53 is common in tumorigenesis, and inflammation can promote RAS-driven tumorigenesis without the need to mutate p53. Here, we show, using a well-established mutant RAS and an inflammation-driven mouse skin tumor model, that loss of the p53 inhibitor iASPP facilitates tumorigenesis. Specifically, iASPP regulates expression of a subset of p63 and AP1 targets, including genes involved in skin differentiation and inflammation, suggesting that loss of iASPP in keratinocytes supports a tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, JNK-mediated phosphorylation regulates iASPP function and inhibits iASPP binding with AP1 components, such as JUND, via PXXP/SH3 domain-mediated interaction. Our results uncover a JNK-iASPP-AP1 regulatory axis that is crucial for tissue homeostasis. We show that iASPP is a tumor suppressor and an AP1 coregulator.

Abstract: Introduction
The calcium-binding protein S100A4 has been found in fibroblasts in many tissues. It has been well studied in the regulating process of inflammation and tumor metastasis. However, as a calcium regulating protein, its expression in the dental pulp has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the in situ expression of S100A4 in dental pulp tissue.
Methods
Five intact and three carious human teeth were collected and sectioned. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to locate areas reflecting the characteristics of the tooth. Based on this initial evaluation, the slides adjacent to these areas were immunohistochemically stained with S100A4 and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) antibodies.
Results
In both the crown and root, S100A4 staining was observed in the odontoblast layer and in odontoblast-like cells, but not in other pulp cells. In contrast, DSPP was expressed in most cells of the dental pulp.
Conclusion
S100A4 is expressed in the odontoblast layer and in odontoblast-like cells in mature human pulp tissue. This protein can be used as a marker to differentiate these two kinds of cells from pulp cells.
