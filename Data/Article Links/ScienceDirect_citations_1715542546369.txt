Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevailing chronic disease in Orthopedics that characterized with severely damaged cartilage and subchondral bone, thus leading to profound disorders of synovial joints. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been applied as a popular non-operative treatment option for promoting musculoskeletal healing. Our previous work demonstrated that PRP protected chondrocytes from interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced apoptosis in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism behind the treatment remains unclear. The current study aimed to unveil the molecular signaling underlying its protective role in chondrocytes. Rat chondrocytes were isolated from newborn Sprague Dawley rats and treated with 5 ng/mL IL-1β for 24 h. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) was determined in both mRNA and protein levels. Next, loss- and gain-of-function assays for HIF-2α were performed using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for HIF-2α and adenovirus-mediated HIF-2α overexpression, respectively. In addition, cell apoptosis markers, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, 3, -9 and -13, and extracellular matrix-related genes were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that IL-1β induced distinct inflammation in chondrocytes. In addition, HIF-2α upregulated in the IL-1β-treated chondrocytes compared to the untreated cells. Interestingly, 10% PRP protected chondrocytes against IL-1β-induced apoptosis and matrix degradation, and meanwhile suppressed the HIF-2α activation. Furthermore, HIF-2α siRNA and HIF-2α overexpression experiments indicated that PRP induced chondroprotection through targeting HIF-2α. Taken together, our findings indicated that PRP attenuates IL-1β-induced chondrocyte apoptosis and inflammation at least partially through inhibiting HIF-2α.

Abstract: Summary
Uncovering vulnerable steps in the life cycle of viruses supports the rational design of antiviral treatments. However, information on viral replication dynamics obtained from traditional bulk assays with host cell populations is inherently limited as the data represent averages over a multitude of unsynchronized replication cycles. Here, we use time-lapse imaging of virus replication in thousands of single cells, combined with computational inference, to identify rate-limiting steps for dengue virus (DENV), a widespread human pathogen. Comparing wild-type DENV with a vaccine candidate mutant, we show that the viral spread in the mutant is greatly attenuated by delayed onset of productive replication, whereas wild-type and mutant virus have identical replication rates. Single-cell analysis done after applying the broad-spectrum antiviral drug, ribavirin, at clinically relevant concentrations revealed the same mechanism of attenuating viral spread. We conclude that the initial steps of infection, rather than the rate of established replication, are quantitatively limiting DENV spread.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionarily conserved ULK1 kinase complex acts as gatekeeper of canonical autophagy and regulates induction of autophagosome biogenesis. To better understand control of ULK1 and analyze whether ULK1 has broader functions that are also linked to the later steps of autophagy, we perform comprehensive phosphoproteomic analyses. Combining in vivo with in vitro data, we identify numerous direct ULK1 target sites within autophagy-relevant proteins that are critical for autophagosome maturation and turnover. In addition, we highlight an intimate crosstalk between ULK1 and several phosphatase complexes. ULK1 is not only a PP2A target but also directly phosphorylates the regulatory PP2A subunit striatin, activating PP2A and serving as positive feedback to promote autophagy-dependent protein turnover. Thus, ULK1 and phosphatase activities are tightly coordinated to robustly regulate protein degradation by autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Elevation in homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with insulin resistance; however, the causality between them and the underlying mechanism remain elusive. Here, we show that Hcy induces insulin resistance and causes diabetic phenotypes by protein cysteine-homocysteinylation (C-Hcy) of the pro-insulin receptor (pro-IR). Mechanistically, Hcy reacts and modifies cysteine-825 of pro-IR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and abrogates the formation of the original disulfide bond. C-Hcy impairs the interaction between pro-IR and the Furin protease in the Golgi apparatus, thereby hindering the cleavage of pro-IR. In mice, an increase in Hcy level decreases the mature IR level in various tissues, thereby inducing insulin resistance and the type 2 diabetes phenotype. Furthermore, inhibition of C-Hcy in vivo and in vitro by overexpressing protein disulfide isomerase rescues the Hcy-induced phenotypes. In conclusion, C-Hcy in the ER can serve as a potential pharmacological target for developing drugs to prevent insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic rewiring and redox balance play pivotal roles in cancer. Cellular senescence is a barrier for tumorigenesis circumvented in cancer cells by poorly understood mechanisms. We report a multi-enzymatic complex that reprograms NAD metabolism by transferring reducing equivalents from NADH to NADP+. This hydride transfer complex (HTC) is assembled by malate dehydrogenase 1, malic enzyme 1, and cytosolic pyruvate carboxylase. HTC is found in phase-separated bodies in the cytosol of cancer or hypoxic cells and can be assembled in vitro with recombinant proteins. HTC is repressed in senescent cells but induced by p53 inactivation. HTC enzymes are highly expressed in mouse and human prostate cancer models, and their inactivation triggers senescence. Exogenous expression of HTC is sufficient to bypass senescence, rescue cells from complex I inhibitors, and cooperate with oncogenic RAS to transform primary cells. Altogether, we provide evidence for a new multi-enzymatic complex that reprograms metabolism and overcomes cellular senescence.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is a fundamental determinant of mRNA metabolism, but its role in innate immunity-driven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity is not known. Here, we show that myeloid lineage-restricted deletion of the m6A “writer” protein Methyltransferase Like 3 (METTL3) prevents age-related and diet-induced development of NAFLD and obesity in mice with improved inflammatory and metabolic phenotypes. Mechanistically, loss of METTL3 results in the differential expression of multiple mRNA transcripts marked with m6A, with a notable increase of DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4) mRNA level. In METTL3-deficient macrophages, there is a significant downregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway activity in response to cellular stress and cytokine stimulation, which can be restored by knockdown of DDIT4. Taken together, our findings identify the contribution of METTL3-mediated m6A modification of Ddit4 mRNA to macrophage metabolic reprogramming in NAFLD and obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose tolerance represents a complex phenotype in which many tissues play important roles and interact to regulate metabolic homeostasis. Here, we perform an analysis of 13C6-glucose tissue distribution, which maps the metabolome and lipidome across 12 metabolically relevant mouse organs and plasma, with integrated 13C6-glucose-derived carbon tracing during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). We measure time profiles of water-soluble metabolites and lipids and integrate the global metabolite response into metabolic pathways. During the OGTT, glucose use is turned on with specific kinetics at the organ level, but fasting substrates like β-hydroxybutyrate are switched off in all organs simultaneously. Timeline profiling of 13C-labeled fatty acids and triacylglycerols across tissues suggests that brown adipose tissue may contribute to the circulating fatty acid pool at maximal plasma glucose levels. The GTTAtlas interactive web application serves as a unique resource for the exploration of whole-body glucose metabolism and time profiles of tissue and plasma metabolites during the OGTT.

Abstract: Summary
Assessing drug response within live native tissue provides increased fidelity with regards to optimizing efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. Here, using longitudinal intravital imaging of a Rac1-Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor mouse coupled with in vivo photoswitching to track intratumoral movement, we help guide treatment scheduling in a live breast cancer setting to impair metastatic progression. We uncover altered Rac1 activity at the center versus invasive border of tumors and demonstrate enhanced Rac1 activity of cells in close proximity to live tumor vasculature using optical window imaging. We further reveal that Rac1 inhibition can enhance tumor cell vulnerability to fluid-flow-induced shear stress and therefore improves overall anti-metastatic response to therapy during transit to secondary sites such as the lung. Collectively, this study demonstrates the utility of single-cell intravital imaging in vivo to demonstrate that Rac1 inhibition can reduce tumor progression and metastases in an autochthonous setting to improve overall survival.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), typically interact with two distinct signal-transducers, i.e., G proteins and β-arrestins (βarrs). Interestingly, there are some non-canonical 7TMRs that lack G protein coupling but interact with βarrs, although an understanding of their transducer coupling preference, downstream signaling, and structural mechanism remains elusive. Here, we characterize two such non-canonical 7TMRs, namely, the decoy D6 receptor (D6R) and the complement C5a receptor subtype 2 (C5aR2), in parallel with their canonical GPCR counterparts. We discover that D6R and C5aR2 efficiently couple to βarrs, exhibit distinct engagement of GPCR kinases (GRKs), and activate non-canonical downstream signaling pathways. We also observe that βarrs adopt distinct conformations for D6R and C5aR2, compared to their canonical GPCR counterparts, in response to common natural agonists. Our study establishes D6R and C5aR2 as βarr-coupled 7TMRs and provides key insights into their regulation and signaling with direct implication for biased agonism.

Abstract: Summary
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters the nucleus to establish infection, but the role of nuclear envelope proteins in this process is incompletely understood. Inner nuclear transmembrane proteins SUN1 and SUN2 connect nuclear lamins to the cytoskeleton and participate in the DNA damage response (DDR). Increased levels of SUN1 or SUN2 potently restrict HIV infection through an unresolved mechanism. Here, we find that the antiviral activities of SUN1 and SUN2 are distinct. HIV-1 and HIV-2 are preferentially inhibited by SUN1 and SUN2, respectively. We identify DNA damage inducers that stimulate HIV-1 infection and show that SUN1, but not SUN2, neutralizes this effect. Finally, we show that chromatin movements and nuclear rotations are associated with the effects of SUN proteins and Lamin A/C on infection. These results reveal an emerging role of chromatin dynamics and the DDR in the control of HIV infection by structural components of the nuclear envelope.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription progression is governed by multitasking regulators including SPT5, an evolutionarily conserved factor implicated in virtually all transcriptional steps from enhancer activation to termination. Here we utilize a rapid degradation system and reveal crucial functions of SPT5 in maintaining cellular and chromatin RNA polymerase II (Pol II) levels. Rapid SPT5 depletion causes a pronounced reduction of paused Pol II at promoters and enhancers, distinct from negative elongation factor (NELF) degradation resulting in short-distance paused Pol II redistribution. Most genes exhibit downregulation, but not upregulation, accompanied by greatly impaired transcription activation, altered chromatin landscape at enhancers, and severe Pol II processivity defects at gene bodies. Phosphorylation of an SPT5 linker at serine 666 potentiates pause release and is antagonized by Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) targeting SPT5 and Pol II, while phosphorylation of the SPT5 C-terminal region links to 3′ end termination. Our findings position SPT5 as an essential positive regulator of global transcription.

Abstract: The development of new vaccines for TB needs to be underpinned by an understanding of both the molecular and cellular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions and how the immune response can be modulated to achieve protection from disease. Complement orchestrates many aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about the contribution of the complement pathways during TB disease, particularly with respect to mycobacterial phenotype. Extracellular communities (biofilms) of M. tuberculosis are found in the acellular rim of granulomas, during disease, and these are likely to be present in post-primary TB episodes, in necrotic lesions. Our study aimed to determine which mycobacterial cell wall components were altered during biofilm growth and how these cell wall alterations modified the complement response. We have shown that M. tuberculosis biofilms modified their cell wall carbohydrates and elicited reduced classical and lectin pathway activation. Consistent with this finding was the reduction of C3b/iC3b deposition on biofilm cell wall carbohydrate extracts. Here, we have highlighted the role of cell wall carbohydrate alterations during biofilm growth of M. tuberculosis and subsequent modulation of complement activation.

Abstract: Summary
Human Vδ2 cells are innate-like γδ T effectors performing potent immune surveillance against tumors. The constitutive expression of NKG2A identifies a subset of Vδ2 T cells licensed with an intrinsic hyper-responsiveness against cancer. Indeed, the transcriptomic profiles of NKG2A+ and NKG2A− cells characterize two distinct “intralineages” of Vδ2 T lymphocytes that appear early during development, keep their phenotypes, and show self-renewal capabilities in adult life. The hyper-responsiveness of NKG2A+ Vδ2 T cells is counterbalanced by the inhibitory signaling delivered by human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E) expressed on malignant cells as a tumor-escape mechanism. However, either masking or knocking out NKG2A restores the capacity of Vδ2 T cells to exert the highest effector functions even against HLA-E+ tumors. This is highly relevant in the clinic, as the different degrees of engagement of the NKG2A-HLA-E checkpoint in hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer directly impact patients’ overall survival. These findings open avenues for developing combined cellular and immunologic anticancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid protein degradation enables cells to quickly modulate protein abundance. Dysregulation of short-lived proteins plays essential roles in disease pathogenesis. A focused map of short-lived proteins remains understudied. Cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor, is widely used in targeted studies to measure degradation kinetics for short-lived proteins. Here, we combined cycloheximide chase assays with advanced quantitative proteomics to map short-lived proteins under translational inhibition in four human cell lines. Among 11,747 quantified proteins, we identified 1,017 short-lived proteins (half-lives ≤ 8 h). These short-lived proteins are less abundant, evolutionarily younger, and less thermally stable than other proteins. We quantified 103 proteins with different stabilities among cell lines. We showed that U2OS and HCT116 cells express truncated forms of ATRX and GMDS, respectively, which have lower stability than their full-length counterparts. This study provides a large-scale resource of human short-lived proteins under translational arrest, leading to untapped avenues of protein regulation for therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Sea urchin sperm swimming is regulated by speract, a decapeptide released from egg jelly that induces chemotaxis and triggers membrane potential (Em) changes, intracellular increases in cyclic nucleotides (cGMP, cAMP), pH (pHi) and calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The identity of the ionic transporters associated with the [Ca2+]i changes required for chemotaxis is not fully known. CatSper, a sperm exclusive Ca2+ channel has been detected by proteomic analysis and immunofluorescence in sea urchin sperm and there is evidence for its involvement in chemotaxis. This work presents an electrophysiological characterization of a CatSper channel in sea urchin sperm. By swelling sperm suspending them in 10-fold diluted artificial sea water (ASW) we achieve on-cell patch-clamp recordings that document a mildly voltage and pHi dependent Na+ permeable channel (in absence of divalent ions in the pipette), sensitive to speract, and blocked by Mibefradil (Mibe), NNC55–0396 (NNC) and RU1968 (RU) resembling CatSper. We also recorded a voltage dependent Cl− channel inhibited by Niflumic Acid and the TMEM16A blocker.

Abstract: Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing an anti-rabies monoclonal antibody (mAb), SO57, was obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) was tagged to the C-terminus of the anti-rabies mAb heavy chain to localize the mAb to the ER and enhance its accumulation. When the inaccurately folded proteins accumulated in the ER exceed its storage capacity, it results in stress that can affect plant development and growth. We generated T1 transformants and obtained homozygous T3 seeds from transgenic Arabidopsis to investigate the effect of KDEL on plant growth. The germination rate did not significantly differ between plants expressing mAb SO57 without KDEL (SO plant) and mAb SO57 with KDEL (SOK plant). The primary roots of SOK agar media grown plants were slightly shorter than those of SO plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed that expression of all 11 ER stress-related genes were not significantly changed in SOK plants relative to SO plants. SOK plants showed approximately three-fold higher mAb expression levels than those of SO plants. Consequently, the purified mAb amount per unit of SOK plant biomass was approximately three times higher than that of SO plants. A neutralization assay revealed that both plants exhibited efficient rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test values against the rabies virus relative to commercially available human rabies immunoglobulins. KDEL did not upregulate ER stress-related genes; therefore, the enhanced production of the mAb did not affect plant growth. Thus, KDEL fusion is recommended for enhancing mAb production in plant systems.

Abstract: Summary
Transcranial neurostimulation methods are utilized as therapies for various neuropsychiatric disorders. Primarily, they entail the delivery of weak subthreshold currents across the brain, which modulate neuronal excitability. However, it is still a puzzle how such weak electrical fields actuate their effects. Previous studies showed that axons are the most sensitive subcellular compartment for direct current stimulation, and maximal polarization is achieved at their terminals. Nonetheless, polarization of axon terminals according to models was predicted to be weak, and the mechanism for substantial axon terminals polarization was obscure. Here, we show that a weak subthreshold electrical field modifies the conductance of voltage-dependent sodium channels in axon terminals, subsequently amplifying their membrane polarization. Moreover, we show that this amplification has substantial effects on synaptic functioning.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an advanced stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with serious consequences that currently lacks approved pharmacological therapies. Recent studies suggest the close relationship between the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the dysregulation of RNA splicing machinery. Here, we reveal death-associated protein kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase-2 (DRAK2) is markedly upregulated in the livers of both NAFLD/NASH patients and NAFLD/NASH diet-fed mice. Hepatic deletion of DRAK2 suppresses the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH. Comprehensive analyses of the phosphoproteome and transcriptome indicated a crucial role of DRAK2 in RNA splicing and identified the splicing factor SRSF6 as a direct binding protein of DRAK2. Further studies demonstrated that binding to DRAK2 inhibits SRSF6 phosphorylation by the SRSF kinase SRPK1 and regulates alternative splicing of mitochondrial function-related genes. In conclusion, our findings reveal an indispensable role of DRAK2 in NAFLD/NASH and offer a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

Abstract: Summary
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produces hallucinations, which are perceptions uncoupled from the external environment. How LSD alters neuronal activities in vivo that underlie abnormal perceptions is unknown. Here, we show that when rats run along a familiar track, hippocampal place cells under LSD reduce their firing rates, their directionality, and their interaction with visual cortical neurons. However, both hippocampal and visual cortical neurons temporarily increase firing rates during head-twitching, a behavioral signature of a hallucination-like state in rodents. When rats are immobile on the track, LSD enhances cortical firing synchrony in a state similar to the wakefulness-to-sleep transition, during which the hippocampal-cortical interaction remains dampened while hippocampal awake reactivation is maintained. Our results suggest that LSD suppresses hippocampal-cortical interactions during active behavior and during immobility, leading to internal hippocampal representations that are degraded and isolated from external sensory input. These effects may contribute to LSD-produced abnormal perceptions.

Abstract: Summary
Viral entry and egress are important determinants of virus infectivity and pathogenicity. β-coronaviruses, including the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), exploit the lysosomal exocytosis pathway for egress. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, but not SARS-CoV ORF3a, promotes lysosomal exocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a facilitates lysosomal targeting of the BORC-ARL8b complex, which mediates trafficking of lysosomes to the vicinity of the plasma membrane, and exocytosis-related SNARE proteins. The Ca2+ channel TRPML3 is required for SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a-mediated lysosomal exocytosis. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a greatly elevates extracellular viral release in cells infected with the coronavirus MHV-A59, which itself lacks ORF3a. In SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, Ser171 and Trp193 are critical for promoting lysosomal exocytosis and blocking autophagy. When these residues are introduced into SARS-CoV ORF3a, it acquires the ability to promote lysosomal exocytosis and inhibit autophagy. Our results reveal a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host factors to promote its extracellular egress.

Abstract: Summary
The selection of goal-directed behaviors is supported by neural circuits located within the frontal cortex. Frontal cortical afferents arise from multiple brain areas, yet the cell-type-specific targeting of these inputs is unclear. Here, we use monosynaptic retrograde rabies mapping to examine the distribution of afferent neurons targeting distinct classes of local inhibitory interneurons and excitatory projection neurons in mouse infralimbic frontal cortex. Interneurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide receive a large proportion of inputs from the hippocampus, while interneurons expressing neuron-derived neurotrophic factor receive a large proportion of inputs from thalamic regions. A similar dichotomy is present among the four different excitatory projection neurons. These results show a prominent bias among long-range hippocampal and thalamic afferent systems in their targeting to specific sets of frontal cortical neurons. Moreover, they suggest the presence of two distinct local microcircuits that control how different inputs govern frontal cortical information processing.

Abstract: Summary
Although humans can produce billions of IgG1 variants through recombination and hypermutation, the diversity of IgG1 clones circulating in human blood plasma has largely eluded direct characterization. Here, we combined several mass-spectrometry-based approaches to reveal that the circulating IgG1 repertoire in human plasma is dominated by a limited number of clones in healthy donors and septic patients. We observe that each individual donor exhibits a unique serological IgG1 repertoire, which remains stable over time but can adapt rapidly to changes in physiology. We introduce an integrative protein- and peptide-centric approach to obtain and validate a full sequence of an individual plasma IgG1 clone de novo. This IgG1 clone emerged at the onset of a septic episode and exhibited a high mutation rate (13%) compared with the closest matching germline DNA sequence, highlighting the importance of de novo sequencing at the protein level. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy, has limited treatment options beyond platinum-based chemotherapy, whereafter acquired resistance is rapid and common. By analyzing expression data from SCLC tumors, patient-derived models, and established cell lines, we show that the expression of TIAM1, an activator of the small GTPase RAC1, is associated with a neuroendocrine gene program. TIAM1 depletion or RAC1 inhibition reduces viability and tumorigenicity of SCLC cells by increasing apoptosis associated with conversion of BCL2 from its pro-survival to pro-apoptotic function via BH3 domain exposure. This conversion is dependent upon cytoplasmic translocation of Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor. TIAM1 interacts with and sequesters Nur77 in SCLC cell nuclei and TIAM1 depletion or RAC1 inhibition promotes Nur77 translocation to the cytoplasm. Mutant TIAM1 with reduced Nur77 binding fails to suppress apoptosis triggered by TIAM1 depletion. In conclusion, TIAM1-RAC1 signaling promotes SCLC cell survival via Nur77 nuclear sequestration.

Abstract: Summary
The etiological role of NSD2 enzymatic activity in solid tumors is unclear. Here we show that NSD2, via H3K36me2 catalysis, cooperates with oncogenic KRAS signaling to drive lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) pathogenesis. In vivo expression of NSD2E1099K, a hyperactive variant detected in individuals with LUAD, rapidly accelerates malignant tumor progression while decreasing survival in KRAS-driven LUAD mouse models. Pathologic H3K36me2 generation by NSD2 amplifies transcriptional output of KRAS and several complementary oncogenic gene expression programs. We establish a versatile in vivo CRISPRi-based system to test gene functions in LUAD and find that NSD2 loss strongly attenuates tumor progression. NSD2 knockdown also blocks neoplastic growth of PDXs (patient-dervived xenografts) from primary LUAD. Finally, a treatment regimen combining NSD2 depletion with MEK1/2 inhibition causes nearly complete regression of LUAD tumors. Our work identifies NSD2 as a bona fide LUAD therapeutic target and suggests a pivotal epigenetic role of the NSD2-H3K36me2 axis in sustaining oncogenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Ribonucleoprotein condensates can exhibit diverse physical states in vitro and in vivo. Despite considerable progress, the relevance of condensate physical states for in vivo biological function remains limited. Here, we investigated the physical properties of processing bodies (P bodies) and their impact on mRNA storage in mature Drosophila oocytes. We show that the conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase Me31B forms viscous P body condensates, which adopt an arrested physical state. We demonstrate that structurally distinct proteins and protein-protein interactions, together with RNA, regulate the physical properties of P bodies. Using live imaging and in situ hybridization, we show that the arrested state and integrity of P bodies support the storage of bicoid (bcd) mRNA and that egg activation modulates P body properties, leading to the release of bcd for translation in the early embryo. Together, this work provides an example of how physical states of condensates regulate cellular function in development.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneous family of complexes comprising Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is instrumental for establishing facultative heterochromatin that is repressive to transcription. However, two PRC1 species, ncPRC1.3 and ncPRC1.5, are known to comprise novel components, AUTS2, P300, and CK2, that convert this repressive function to that of transcription activation. Here, we report that individuals harboring mutations in the HX repeat domain of AUTS2 exhibit defects in AUTS2 and P300 interaction as well as a developmental disorder reflective of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is mainly associated with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CREBBP/EP300. Moreover, the absence of AUTS2 or mutation in its HX repeat domain gives rise to misregulation of a subset of developmental genes and curtails motor neuron differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. The transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) has a novel and integral role in this neurodevelopmental process, being required for ncPRC1.3 recruitment to chromatin.

Abstract: Summary
During tumor progression, lysosome function is often maladaptively upregulated to match the high energy demand required for cancer cell hyper-proliferation and invasion. Here, we report that mucolipin TRP channel 1 (TRPML1), a lysosomal Ca2+ and Zn2+ release channel that regulates multiple aspects of lysosome function, is dramatically upregulated in metastatic melanoma cells compared with normal cells. TRPML-specific synthetic agonists (ML-SAs) are sufficient to induce rapid (within hours) lysosomal Zn2+-dependent necrotic cell death in metastatic melanoma cells while completely sparing normal cells. ML-SA-caused mitochondria swelling and dysfunction lead to cellular ATP depletion. While pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of TRPML1 in metastatic melanoma cells prevents such cell death, overexpression of TRPML1 in normal cells confers ML-SA vulnerability. In the melanoma mouse models, ML-SAs exhibit potent in vivo efficacy of suppressing tumor progression. Hence, targeting maladaptively upregulated lysosome machinery can selectively eradicate metastatic tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Early blastomeres of mouse preimplantation embryos exhibit bi-potential cell fate, capable of generating both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages in blastocysts. Here we identify three major two-cell-stage (2C)-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) as the molecular hallmark of this bi-potential plasticity. Using the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of all three 2C-specific ERVs, we identify Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) as their major upstream regulator. Klf5 is essential for bi-potential cell fate; a single Klf5-overexpressing embryonic stem cell (ESC) generates terminally differentiated embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages in chimeric embryos, and Klf5 directly induces inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) specification genes. Intriguingly, Klf5 and Klf4 act redundantly during ICM specification, whereas Klf5 deficiency alone impairs TE specification. Klf5 is regulated by multiple 2C-specific transcription factors, particularly Dux, and the Dux/Klf5 axis is evolutionarily conserved. The 2C-specific transcription program converges on Klf5 to establish bi-potential cell fate, enabling a cell state with dual activation of ICM and TE genes.

Impact of vaginal distention on cell senescence in an animal model of pelvic organ prolapse,

Abstract: Objective
Cellular senescence, associated with aging, leads to impaired tissue regeneration. We hypothesize that vaginal injury initiates cell senescence, further propagated during aging resulting in pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Our objective was to employ a mouse model of POP (Fibulin-5 knockout mice, Fbln5-/-) to determine if vaginal distention leads to cellular senescence and POP.
Methods
6wk old females [wild-type (WT), n = 81; Fbln5-/-, n = 47)] were assigned to control vs vaginal distention, which approximated vaginal delivery. Serial POP measurements were obtained until vagina were harvested from euthanized mice at 24, 48, 72 h and 1wk. Markers of cell senescence were quantified by immunofluorescence. DNA damage was assessed with γ-H2Ax.
Results
WT distended mice showed decreased p53 (p = 0.0230) and γ-H2Ax (p = 0.0008) in vaginal stromal cells at 1wk compared to controls. In WT mice, SA-β-Gal activity increased 1wk after distention (p = 0.05). In Fbln5-/- mice, p53 and γ-H2Ax did not decrease, but p16 decreased 72 h after distention (p = 0.0150). SA-β-Gal activity also increased in Fbln5-/-, but at earlier time points and 1wk after distention (p < 0.0001). Fbln5-/- mice developed POP after distention earlier than non distended animals (p = 0.0135).
Conclusions
Vaginal distention downregulates p53 and γ-H2Ax in WT mice, thereby promoting cell proliferation 1wk after injury. This was absent among Fbln5-/- distention mice suggesting they do not escape senescence. These findings indicate a failure of cellular protection from senescence in animals predisposed to POP.

Abstract: Summary
Previous large-scale studies have uncovered many features that determine the processing of microRNA (miRNA) precursors; however, they have been conducted in vitro. Here, we introduce MapToCleave, a method to simultaneously profile processing of thousands of distinct RNA structures in living cells. We find that miRNA precursors with a stable lower basal stem are more efficiently processed and also have higher expression in vivo in tissues from 20 animal species. We systematically compare the importance of known and novel sequence and structural features and test biogenesis of miRNA precursors from 10 animal and plant species in human cells. Lastly, we provide evidence that the GHG motif better predicts processing when defined as a structure rather than sequence motif, consistent with recent cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies. In summary, we apply a screening assay in living cells to reveal the importance of lower basal stem stability for miRNA processing and in vivo expression.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory processing is essential for motor control. Climbing fibers from the inferior olive transmit sensory signals to Purkinje cells, but how the signals are represented in the cerebellar cortex remains elusive. To examine the olivocerebellar organization of the mouse brain, we perform quantitative Ca2+ imaging to measure complex spikes (CSs) evoked by climbing fiber inputs over the entire dorsal surface of the cerebellum simultaneously. The surface is divided into approximately 200 segments, each composed of ∼100 Purkinje cells that fire CSs synchronously. Our in vivo imaging reveals that, although stimulation of four limb muscles individually elicits similar global CS responses across nearly all segments, the timing and location of a stimulus are derived by Bayesian inference from coordinated activation and inactivation of multiple segments on a single trial basis. We propose that the cerebellum performs segment-based, distributed-population coding that represents the conditional probability of sensory events.

Abstract: Summary
Apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages (efferocytosis) promotes resolution signaling pathways, which can be triggered by molecules derived from the phagolysosomal degradation of apoptotic cells. We show here that nucleotides derived from the hydrolysis of apoptotic cell DNA by phagolysosomal DNase2a activate a DNA−PKcs−mTORC2/Rictor pathway that increases Myc to promote non-inflammatory macrophage proliferation. Efferocytosis-induced proliferation expands the pool of resolving macrophages in vitro and in mice, including zymosan-induced peritonitis, dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis, and atherosclerosis regression. In the dexamethasone-thymus model, hematopoietic Rictor deletion blocked efferocytosing macrophage proliferation, apoptotic cell clearance, and tissue resolution. In atherosclerosis regression, silencing macrophage Rictor or DNase2a blocked efferocyte proliferation, apoptotic cell clearance, and plaque stabilization. In view of previous work showing that other types of apoptotic cell cargo can promote resolution in individual efferocytosing macrophages, the findings here suggest that signaling-triggered apoptotic cell-derived nucleotides can amplify this benefit by increasing the number of these macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a prime environmental stressor that our epidermis is exposed to on a daily basis. To avert UV-induced damage, epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) become pigmented via a process of heterotypic interaction between melanocytes and EpSCs; however, the molecular mechanisms of this interaction are not well understood. In this study, we show that the function of a key chromatin regulator, the Polycomb complex, was reduced upon UV exposure in human and mouse epidermis. Genetic ablation of key Polycomb subunits in murine EpSCs, mimicking depletion upon UV exposure, results in an increased number of epidermal melanocytes and subsequent epidermal pigmentation. Genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin studies show that Polycomb regulates the expression of UV-responsive genes and identifies type II collagen (COL2A1) as a critical secreted regulator of melanogenesis and epidermal pigmentation. Together, our findings show how UV exposure induces Polycomb-mediated changes in EpSCs to affect melanocyte behavior and promote epidermal pigmentation.

Abstract: Summary
The endosomal recycling system dynamically tunes synaptic strength, which underlies synaptic plasticity. Exocytosis is involved in the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), as postsynaptic cleavage of the SNARE (soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor) protein VAMP2 by tetanus toxin blocks LTP. Moreover, induction of LTP increases the exocytosis of transferrin receptors (TfRs) and markers of recycling endosomes (REs), as well as post-synaptic AMPA type receptors (AMPARs). However, the interplay between AMPAR and TfR exocytosis remains unclear. Here, we identify VAMP4 as the vesicular SNARE that mediates most dendritic RE exocytosis. In contrast, VAMP2 plays a minor role in RE exocytosis. LTP induction increases the exocytosis of both VAMP2- and VAMP4-labeled organelles. Knock down (KD) of VAMP4 decreases TfR recycling but increases AMPAR recycling. Moreover, VAMP4 KD increases AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, which consequently occludes LTP expression. The opposing changes in AMPAR and TfR recycling upon VAMP4 KD reveal their sorting into separate endosomal populations.

Abstract: Summary
To survive, mammalian cells must adapt to environmental challenges. While the cellular response to mild stress has been widely studied, how cells respond to severe stress remains unclear. We show here that under severe hyperosmotic stress, cells enter a transient hibernation-like state in anticipation of recovery. We demonstrate this adaptive pausing response (APR) is a coordinated cellular response that limits ATP supply and consumption through mitochondrial fragmentation and widespread pausing of mRNA translation. This pausing is accomplished by ribosome stalling at translation initiation codons, which keeps mRNAs poised to resume translation upon recovery. We further show that recovery from severe stress involves ISR (integrated stress response) signaling that permits cell cycle progression, resumption of growth, and reversal of mitochondria fragmentation. Our findings indicate that cells can respond to severe stress via a hibernation-like mechanism that preserves vital elements of cellular function under harsh environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Variability in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease severity between individuals is partly due to genetic factors. Here, we identify 4 genomic loci with suggestive associations for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and 19 for COVID-19 disease severity. Four of these 23 loci likely have an ethnicity-specific component. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals in 11 loci colocalize with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of 20 genes in 62 tissues/cell types (range: 1:43 tissues/gene), including lung, brain, heart, muscle, and skin as well as the digestive system and immune system. We perform genetic fine mapping to compute 99% credible SNP sets, which identify 10 GWAS loci that have eight or fewer SNPs in the credible set, including three loci with one single likely causal SNP. Our study suggests that the diverse symptoms and disease severity of COVID-19 observed between individuals is associated with variants across the genome, affecting gene expression levels in a wide variety of tissue types.

Abstract: Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent cell mass, called callus, which can be subsequently used for de novo shoot regeneration through a two-step in vitro tissue culture method. MET1-dependent CG methylation has been implicated in plant regeneration in Arabidopsis, because the met1-3 mutant exhibits increased shoot regeneration compared with the wild-type. To understand the role of MET1 in de novo shoot regeneration, we compared the genome-wide DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of wild-type and met1-3 callus and leaf. The CG methylation patterns were largely unchanged during leaf-to-callus transition, suggesting that the altered regeneration phenotype of met1-3 was caused by the constitutively hypomethylated genes, independent of the tissue type. In particular, MET1-dependent CG methylation was observed at the blue light receptor genes, CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) and CRY2, which reduced their expression. Coexpression network analysis revealed that the CRY1 gene was closely linked to cytokinin signaling genes. Consistently, functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in met1-3 showed that gene ontology terms related to light and hormone signaling were overrepresented. Overall, our findings indicate that MET1-dependent repression of light and cytokinin signaling influences plant regeneration capacity and shoot identity establishment.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic proto-oncogene variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to technical advances in single-cell biology, the appreciation of cellular heterogeneity has increased, which has aided our understanding of organ function, homeostasis, and disease progression. The oviduct (also known as the fallopian tube) is the distalmost portion of the female reproductive tract. It is essential for reproduction and the proposed origin of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). In mammals, the oviduct is morphologically segmented along the ovary-uterus axis into four evolutionally conserved regions. It is unclear, however, if there is a diversification of epithelial cell characteristics between these regions. In this study, we identify transcriptionally distinct populations of secretory and multiciliated cells restricted to the distal and proximal regions of the oviduct. We demonstrate that distal and proximal populations are distinct lineages specified early in Müllerian duct development and are maintained separately. These results aid our understanding of epithelial development, homeostasis, and initiation of disease from the oviduct.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents. However, it causes pulmonary toxicity which decreases its clinical use in human cancer therapy. The present study was undertaken to obtain an insight into the potential protective effect of hesperetin (HES) against doxorubicin-induced pulmonary toxicity in rats. The animals were divided into 4 groups with 7 rats per group. The experimental treatments were as follows: Control, DOX, DOX + HES, and HES groups. DOX was administered at the dosage of 15 mg/kg i.p for a single dose. HES was administered at the dosage of 50 mg/kg by oral gavage every other day. After 28 days, biochemical parameters, oxidative stress status, histopathological changes, apoptosis-related genes and apoptotic index (AI) were examined of lung tissue. Histopathological changes, Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), Caspase-3 (Casp3), Cytochrome c (Cytc), apoptosis-related genes, and AI significantly increased in the DOX group relative to the control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) decreased in the DOX group relative to the control group. However, histopathological findings, MDA, AI, and PAPR1, Casp3 protein expression, mRNA expression of Cytc significantly decreased, while SOD, GPx increased in the DOX + HES group relative to the DOX group. These results attested HES might be a potential agent for the treatment of DOX-induced pulmonary toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI proteins are known as mediators of transposon silencing in animal germlines but are also found in adult pluripotent stem cells of highly regenerative animals, where they are essential for regeneration. Study of the nuclear PIWI protein SMEDWI-2 in the planarian somatic stem cell system reveals an intricate interplay between transposons and cell differentiation in which a subset of transposons is inevitably activated during cell differentiation, and the PIWI protein is required to regain control. Absence of SMEDWI-2 leads to tissue-specific transposon derepression related to cell-type-specific chromatin remodeling events and in addition causes reduced accessibility of lineage-specific genes and defective cell differentiation, resulting in fatal tissue dysfunction. Finally, we show that additional PIWI proteins provide a stem-cell-specific second layer of protection in planarian neoblasts. These findings reveal a far-reaching role of PIWI proteins and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in stem cell biology and cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) are increasingly suspected to play an exacerbating role in a range of acute brain injuries, including stroke, possibly through their interactions with cortical blood flow. We use simultaneous wide-field imaging of neural activity and hemodynamics in Thy1-GCaMP6f mice to explore the neurovascular dynamics of CSDs during and following Rose Bengal-mediated photothrombosis. CSDs are observed in all mice as slow-moving waves of GCaMP fluorescence extending far beyond the photothrombotic area. Initial CSDs are accompanied by profound vasoconstriction and leave residual oligemia and ischemia in their wake. Later, CSDs evoke variable responses, from constriction to biphasic to vasodilation. However, CSD-evoked vasoconstriction is found to be more likely during rapid, high-amplitude CSDs in regions with stronger oligemia and ischemia, which, in turn, worsens after each repeated CSD. This feedback loop may explain the variable but potentially devastating effects of CSDs in the context of acute brain injury.

Abstract: Metabolomics, the application of analytical chemistry methodologies to survey the chemical composition of a biological system, is used to globally profile and compare metabolites in one or more groups of samples. Given that metabolites are the terminal end-products of cellular metabolic processes, or ‘phenotype’ of a cell, tissue, or organism, metabolomics is valuable to the study of the maternal-fetal interface as it has the potential to reveal nuanced complexities of a biological system as well as differences over time or between individuals. The placenta acts as the primary site of maternal-fetal exchange, the success of which is paramount to growth and development of offspring during pregnancy and beyond. Although the study of metabolomics has proven moderately useful for the screening, diagnosis, and understanding of the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications, the placental metabolome in the context of a healthy pregnancy remains poorly characterized and understood. Herein, we discuss the technical aspects of metabolomics and review the current literature describing the placental metabolome in human and animal models, in the context of health and disease. Finally, we highlight areas for future opportunities in the emerging field of placental metabolomics.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of physiological modulators of nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) activity is paramount for understanding the link between metabolism and transcriptional networks that orchestrate development and cellular physiology. Using libraries of metabolic enzymes alongside their substrates and products, we identify 1-deoxysphingosines as modulators of the activity of NR2F1 and 2 (COUP-TFs), which are orphan NHRs that are critical for development of the nervous system, heart, veins, and lymphatic vessels. We show that these non-canonical alanine-based sphingolipids bind to the NR2F1/2 ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and modulate their transcriptional activity in cell-based assays at physiological concentrations. Furthermore, inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis phenocopies NR2F1/2 deficiency in endothelium and cardiomyocytes, and increases in 1-deoxysphingosine levels activate NR2F1/2-dependent differentiation programs. Our findings suggest that 1-deoxysphingosines are physiological regulators of NR2F1/2-mediated transcription.

Abstract: Summary
In this work, we show that Not4 and Not5 from the Ccr4-Not complex modulate translation elongation dynamics and change ribosome A-site dwelling occupancy in a codon-dependent fashion. These codon-specific changes in not5Δ cells are very robust and independent of codon position within the mRNA, the overall mRNA codon composition, or changes of mRNA expression levels. They inversely correlate with codon-specific changes in cells depleted for eIF5A and positively correlate with those in cells depleted for ribosome-recycling factor Rli1. Not5 resides in punctate loci, co-purifies with ribosomes and Rli1, but not with eIF5A, and limits mRNA solubility. Overexpression of wild-type or non-complementing Rli1 and loss of Rps7A ubiquitination enable Not4 E3 ligase-dependent translation of polyarginine stretches. We propose that Not4 and Not5 modulate translation elongation dynamics to produce a soluble proteome by Rps7A ubiquitination, dynamic condensates that limit mRNA solubility and exclude eIF5A, and a moonlighting function of Rli1.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy that includes subtypes defined by differential expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (SCLC-A, -N, and -P, respectively). To define the heterogeneity of tumors and their associated microenvironments across subtypes, we sequenced 155,098 transcriptomes from 21 human biospecimens, including 54,523 SCLC transcriptomes. We observe greater tumor diversity in SCLC than lung adenocarcinoma, driven by canonical, intermediate, and admixed subtypes. We discover a PLCG2-high SCLC phenotype with stem-like, pro-metastatic features that recurs across subtypes and predicts worse overall survival. SCLC exhibits greater immune sequestration and less immune infiltration than lung adenocarcinoma, and SCLC-N shows less immune infiltrate and greater T cell dysfunction than SCLC-A. We identify a profibrotic, immunosuppressive monocyte/macrophage population in SCLC tumors that is particularly associated with the recurrent, PLCG2-high subpopulation.

Abstract: Summary
The CBX family of proteins is central to proper mammalian development via key roles in Polycomb-mediated maintenance of repression. CBX proteins in differentiated lineages have chromatin compaction and phase separation activities that might contribute to maintaining repressed chromatin. The predominant CBX protein in pluripotent cells, CBX7, lacks the domain required for these activities. We inserted this functional domain into CBX7 in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to test the hypothesis that it contributes a key epigenetic function. ESCs expressing this chimeric CBX7 were impaired in their ability to properly form embryoid bodies and neural progenitor cells and showed reduced activation of lineage-specific genes across differentiation. Neural progenitors exhibited a corresponding inappropriate maintenance of Polycomb binding at neural-specific loci over the course of differentiation. We propose that a switch in the ability to compact and phase separate is a central aspect of Polycomb group function during the transition from pluripotency to differentiated lineages.

Abstract: Summary
DNA sequencing data continue to progress toward longer reads with increasingly lower sequencing error rates. Here, we define an algorithmic approach, mdBG, that makes use of minimizer-space de Bruijn graphs to enable long-read genome assembly. mdBG achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in both speed and memory usage over existing methods without compromising accuracy. A human genome is assembled in under 10 min using 8 cores and 10 GB RAM, and 60 Gbp of metagenome reads are assembled in 4 min using 1 GB RAM. In addition, we constructed a minimizer-space de Bruijn graph-based representation of 661,405 bacterial genomes, comprising 16 million nodes and 45 million edges, and successfully search it for anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in 12 min. We expect our advances to be essential to sequence analysis, given the rise of long-read sequencing in genomics, metagenomics, and pangenomics. Code for constructing mdBGs is freely available for download at https://github.com/ekimb/rust-mdbg/.

Abstract: Summary
Lengthy multidrug chemotherapy is required to achieve a durable cure in tuberculosis. However, we lack well-validated, high-throughput in vitro models that predict animal outcomes. Here, we provide an extensible approach to rationally prioritize combination therapies for testing in in vivo mouse models of tuberculosis. We systematically measured Mycobacterium tuberculosis response to all two- and three-drug combinations among ten antibiotics in eight conditions that reproduce lesion microenvironments, resulting in >500,000 measurements. Using these in vitro data, we developed classifiers predictive of multidrug treatment outcome in a mouse model of disease relapse and identified ensembles of in vitro models that best describe in vivo treatment outcomes. We identified signatures of potencies and drug interactions in specific in vitro models that distinguish whether drug combinations are better than the standard of care in two important preclinical mouse models. Our framework is generalizable to other difficult-to-treat diseases requiring combination therapies. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane contact between intracellular organelles is important in mediating organelle communication. However, the assembly of molecular machinery at membrane contact site and its internal organization correlating with its functional activity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a gel-like condensation of Cidec, a crucial protein for obesity development by facilitating lipid droplet (LD) fusion, occurs at the LD-LD contact site (LDCS) through phase separation. The homomeric interaction between the multivalent N terminus of Cidec is sufficient to promote its phase separation both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, Cidec condensation at LDCSs generates highly plastic and lipid-permeable fusion plates that are geometrically constrained by donor LDs. In addition, Cidec condensates are distributed unevenly in the fusion plate generating stochastic sub-compartments that may represent unique lipid passageways during LD fusion. We have thus uncovered the organization and functional significance of geometry-constrained Cidec phase separation in mediating LD fusion and lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Pairs of paralogs may share common functionality and, hence, display synthetic lethal interactions. As the majority of human genes have an identifiable paralog, exploiting synthetic lethality between paralogs may be a broadly applicable approach for targeting gene loss in cancer. However, only a biased subset of human paralog pairs has been tested for synthetic lethality to date. Here, by analyzing genome-wide CRISPR screens and molecular profiles of over 700 cancer cell lines, we identify features predictive of synthetic lethality between paralogs, including shared protein-protein interactions and evolutionary conservation. We develop a machine-learning classifier based on these features to predict which paralog pairs are most likely to be synthetic lethal and to explain why. We show that our classifier accurately predicts the results of combinatorial CRISPR screens in cancer cell lines and furthermore can distinguish pairs that are synthetic lethal in multiple cell lines from those that are cell-line specific. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric G-protein-coupled receptors activated by the main excitatory neurotransmitter, L-glutamate. mGluR activation by agonists binding in the venus flytrap domain is regulated by positive (PAM) or negative (NAM) allosteric modulators binding to the 7-transmembrane domain (7TM). We report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of fully inactive and intermediate-active conformations of mGlu5 receptor bound to an antagonist and a NAM or an agonist and a PAM, respectively, as well as the crystal structure of the 7TM bound to a photoswitchable NAM. The agonist induces a large movement between the subunits, bringing the 7TMs together and stabilizing a 7TM conformation structurally similar to the inactive state. Using functional approaches, we demonstrate that the PAM stabilizes a 7TM active conformation independent of the conformational changes induced by agonists, representing an alternative mode of mGlu activation. These findings provide a structural basis for different mGluR activation modes.

Abstract: Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is a membrane protein with four transmembrane helices that form an octameric ion channel with voltage-dependent activation. There are four conserved cysteine (Cys) residues in the extracellular domain that form two intramolecular disulfide bonds. We investigated the roles of C42-C127 and C44-C161 in human CALHM1 channel biogenesis and the ionic current (ICALHM1). Replacing Cys with Ser or Ala abolished the membrane trafficking as well as ICALHM1. Immunoblotting analysis revealed dithiothreitol-sensitive multimeric CALHM1, which was markedly reduced in C44S and C161S, but preserved in C42S and C127S. The mixed expression of C42S and wild-type did not show a dominant-negative effect. While the heteromeric assembly of CALHM1 and CALHM3 formed active ion channels, the co-expression of C42S and CALHM3 did not produce functional channels. Despite the critical structural role of the extracellular cysteine residues, a treatment with the membrane-impermeable reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP, 2 mM) did not affect ICALHM1 for up to 30 min. Interestingly, incubation with TCEP (2 mM) for 2-6 h reduced both ICALHM1 and the surface expression of CALHM1 in a time-dependent manner. We propose that the intramolecular disulfide bonds are essential for folding, oligomerization, trafficking and maintenance of CALHM1 in the plasma membrane, but dispensable for the voltage-dependent activation once expressed on the plasma membrane.

Abstract: CXCR4 plays an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and metastasis. Some previous studies have indicated CXCR4 as a therapeutic target in cancer. CXCR4 is known as a direct target of miR-146a. The present study aimed to investigate how exogenous induction of miR-146a affects CXCR4 gene and protein expression and also proliferation, apoptosis and migration of CRC cells. Transfection of Caco-2 and SW480 cells by a synthetic miR-146a mimic led to downregulation of CXCR4 expression at both gene and protein levels. It also downregulated expression of several miR-146a targets, including GSK3B, IRAK1, TRAF6, AKT2, SMAD4, EGFR and NFKB1, mostly in SW480 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest in the both cell lines, while the apoptotic rate was also decreased. In regards to epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors, VIM was downregulated in the both cell lines, but SNAI1 was upregulated in Caco-2 cells. The wound closure assay showed a reduction in cell migration in SW480 cells, but an opposite effect was detected in Caco-2 cells following transfection with miR-146a mimic. Therefore, our results are indicating that overexpression of miR-146a, despite downregulation of oncogenic CXCR4, may not lead to a universal tumor suppressive effect in all CRC cells, and this is possibly due to differences in miR-146a effects on signaling pathways in each cell type. Selection of miR-146a for tumor suppression requires enough details regarding the signaling profile of cancer cells otherwise it may produce unexpected outcome.

Abstract: Summary
The mortality risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has been linked to the cytokine storm caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the inflammatory responses shared between COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that feature cytokine storms may therefore help in developing improved therapeutic strategies. Here, we use integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptomes to characterize the inflammatory signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19, sepsis, and HIV infection. We identify ten hyperinflammatory cell subtypes in which monocytes are the main contributors to the transcriptional differences in these infections. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients share hyperinflammatory signatures with HIV infection and immunosuppressive signatures with sepsis. Finally, we construct a “three-stage” model of heterogeneity among COVID-19 patients, related to the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive signatures in monocytes. Our study thus reveals cellular and molecular insights about inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and provides therapeutic guidance to improve treatments for subsets of COVID-19 patients.

Abstract: Summary
A heterozygous missense mutation of the islet β cell-enriched MAFA transcription factor (p.Ser64Phe [S64F]) is found in patients with adult-onset β cell dysfunction (diabetes or insulinomatosis), with men more prone to diabetes than women. This mutation engenders increased stability to the unstable MAFA protein. Here, we develop a S64F MafA mouse model to determine how β cell function is affected and find sex-dependent phenotypes. Heterozygous mutant males (MafAS64F/+) display impaired glucose tolerance, while females are slightly hypoglycemic with improved blood glucose clearance. Only MafAS64F/+ males show transiently higher MafA protein levels preceding glucose intolerance and sex-dependent changes to genes involved in Ca2+ signaling, DNA damage, aging, and senescence. MAFAS64F production in male human β cells also accelerate cellular senescence and increase senescence-associated secretory proteins compared to cells expressing MAFAWT. These results implicate a conserved mechanism of accelerated islet aging and senescence in promoting diabetes in MAFAS64F carriers in a sex-biased manner.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) are a family of kinases that control fundamental processes, including cell growth, DNA damage repair, and gene expression. Although their regulation and activities are well characterized, little is known about how PIKKs fold and assemble into active complexes. Previous work has identified a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) cochaperone, the TTT complex, that specifically stabilizes PIKKs. Here, we describe a mechanism by which TTT promotes their de novo maturation in fission yeast. We show that TTT recognizes newly synthesized PIKKs during translation. Although PIKKs form multimeric complexes, we find that they do not engage in cotranslational assembly with their partners. Rather, our findings suggest a model by which TTT protects nascent PIKK polypeptides from misfolding and degradation because PIKKs acquire their native state after translation is terminated. Thus, PIKK maturation and assembly are temporally segregated, suggesting that the biogenesis of large complexes requires both dedicated chaperones and cotranslational interactions between subunits.

Abstract: Summary
Young adult cancer has increased in incidence worldwide, but its molecular etiologies remain unclear. We systematically characterize genomic profiles of young adult tumors with ages of onset ≤50 years and compare them to later-onset tumors using over 6,000 cases across 14 cancer types. While young adult tumors generally show lower mutation burdens and comparable copy-number variation rates compared to later-onset cases, they are enriched for multiple driver mutations and copy-number alterations in subtype-specific contexts. Characterization of tumor immune microenvironments reveals pan-cancer patterns of elevated TGF-β response/dendritic cells and lower IFN-γ response/macrophages relative to later-onset tumors, corresponding to age-related responses to immunotherapy in several cancer types. Finally, we identify prevalent clinically actionable events that disproportionally affect young adult or later-onset cases. The resulting catalog of age-related molecular drivers can guide precision diagnostics and treatments for young adult cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a commonly inherited form of autism and intellectual disability, is associated with emotional symptoms that implicate dysfunction of the amygdala. However, current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is based primarily on studies in the hippocampus and neocortex, where FXS defects have been corrected by inhibiting group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Here, we observe that activation, rather than inhibition, of mGluRs in the basolateral amygdala reverses impairments in a rat model of FXS. FXS rats exhibit deficient recall of auditory conditioned fear, which is accompanied by a range of in vitro and in vivo deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity. We find presynaptic mGluR5 in the amygdala, activation of which reverses deficient synaptic transmission and plasticity, thereby restoring normal fear learning in FXS rats. This highlights the importance of modifying the prevailing mGluR-based framework for therapeutic strategies to include circuit-specific differences in FXS pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence for prefrontal cortical (PFC) GABAergic dysfunction is one of the most consistent findings in schizophrenia and may contribute to cognitive deficits. Recent studies suggest that the mGlu1 subtype of metabotropic glutamate receptor regulates cortical inhibition; however, understanding the mechanisms through which mGlu1 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) regulate PFC microcircuit function and cognition is essential for advancing these potential therapeutics toward the clinic. We report a series of electrophysiology, optogenetic, pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging, and animal behavior studies demonstrating that activation of mGlu1 receptors increases inhibitory transmission in the prelimbic PFC by selective excitation of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs). An mGlu1 PAM reverses cortical hyperactivity and concomitant cognitive deficits induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Using in vivo optogenetics, we show that prelimbic SST-INs are necessary for mGlu1 PAM efficacy. Collectively, these findings suggest that mGlu1 PAMs could reverse cortical GABAergic deficits and exhibit efficacy in treating cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebral cortex executes highly skilled movement, necessitating that it connects accurately with specific brainstem and spinal motor circuitry. Corticospinal neurons (CSN) must correctly target specific spinal segments, but the basis for this targeting remains unknown. In the accompanying report, we show that segmentally distinct CSN subpopulations are molecularly distinct from early development, identifying candidate molecular controls over segmentally specific axon targeting. Here, we functionally investigate two of these candidate molecular controls, Crim1 and Kelch-like 14 (Klhl14), identifying their critical roles in directing CSN axons to appropriate spinal segmental levels in the white matter prior to axon collateralization. Crim1 and Klhl14 are specifically expressed by distinct CSN subpopulations and regulate their differental white matter projection targeting—Crim1 directs thoracolumbar axon extension, while Klhl14 limits axon extension to bulbar-cervical segments. These molecular regulators of descending spinal projections constitute the first stages of a dual-directional set of complementary controls over CSN diversity for segmentally and functionally distinct circuitry.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokines are typically single gene products, except for the heterodimeric interleukin (IL)-12 family. The two subunits (IL-12p40 and IL-12p35) of the prototype IL-12 are known to be simultaneously co-expressed in activated myeloid cells, which secrete the fully active heterodimer to promote interferon (IFN)γ production in innate and adaptive cells. We find that chimeric mice containing mixtures of cells that can only express either IL-12p40 or IL-12p35, but not both together, generate functional IL-12. This alternate two-cell pathway requires IL-12p40 from hematopoietic cells to extracellularly associate with IL-12p35 from radiation-resistant cells. The two-cell mechanism is sufficient to propel local T cell differentiation in sites distal to the initial infection and helps control systemic dissemination of a pathogen, although not parasite burden, at the site of infection. Broadly, this suggests that early secretion of IL-12p40 monomers by sentinel cells at the infection site may help prepare distal host tissues for potential pathogen arrival.

Abstract: Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) subunit plays a critical role in the adaptive cellular response of hypoxic tumor cells to low oxygen tension by activating gene-expression programs that control cancer cell metabolism, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance. Phosphorylation is involved in the stabilization and regulation of HIF-1α transcriptional activity. HIF-1α is activated by several factors, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily. MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP-3) is a cytoplasmic dual-specificity phosphatase specific for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). Recent evidence indicates that hypoxia increases the endogenous levels of both MKP-3 mRNA and protein. However, its role in the response of cells to hypoxia is poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrated that small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of MKP-3 enhanced HIF-1α (not HIF-2α) levels. Conversely, MKP-3 overexpression suppressed HIF-1α (not HIF-2α) levels, as well as the expression levels of hypoxia-responsive genes (LDHA, CA9, GLUT-1, and VEGF), in hypoxic colon cancer cells. These findings indicated that MKP-3, induced by HIF-1α in hypoxia, negatively regulates HIF-1α protein levels and hypoxia-responsive genes. However, we also found that long-term hypoxia (>12 h) induced proteasomal degradation of MKP-3 in a lactic acid-dependent manner. Taken together, MKP-3 expression is modulated by the hypoxic conditions prevailing in colon cancer, and plays a role in cellular adaptation to tumor hypoxia and tumor progression. Thus, MKP-3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote metastasis and inhibit T cells, but macrophages can be polarized to kill cancer cells. Macrophage polarization could thus be a strategy for controlling cancer. We show that macrophages from metastatic pleural effusions of breast cancer patients can be polarized to kill cancer cells with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and interferon (IFN) γ. MPLA + IFNγ injected intratumorally or intraperitoneally reduces primary tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer mouse models, suppresses metastasis, and enhances chemotherapy response in an ovarian cancer model. Both macrophages and T cells are critical for the treatment's anti-metastatic effects. MPLA + IFNγ stimulates type I IFN signaling, reprograms CD206+ TAMs to inducible NO synthase (iNOS)+ macrophages, and activates cytotoxic T cells through macrophage-secreted interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). MPLA and IFNγ are used individually in clinical practice and together represent a previously unexplored approach for engaging a systemic anti-tumor immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying movement is critical for understanding animal behavior. Advances in computer vision now enable markerless tracking from 2D video, but most animals move in 3D. Here, we introduce Anipose, an open-source toolkit for robust markerless 3D pose estimation. Anipose is built on the 2D tracking method DeepLabCut, so users can expand their existing experimental setups to obtain accurate 3D tracking. It consists of four components: (1) a 3D calibration module, (2) filters to resolve 2D tracking errors, (3) a triangulation module that integrates temporal and spatial regularization, and (4) a pipeline to structure processing of large numbers of videos. We evaluate Anipose on a calibration board as well as mice, flies, and humans. By analyzing 3D leg kinematics tracked with Anipose, we identify a key role for joint rotation in motor control of fly walking. To help users get started with 3D tracking, we provide tutorials and documentation at http://anipose.org/.

Abstract: Summary
The human microbiota plays a critical role in host health. Proper development of the infant microbiome is particularly important. Its dysbiosis leads to both short-term health issues and long-term disorders lasting into adulthood. A central way in which the microbiome interacts with the host is through the production of effector molecules, such as proteins and small molecules. Here, a metagenomic library constructed from 14 infant stool microbiomes is analyzed for the production of effectors that modulate three distinct host pathways: immune response (nuclear factor κB [NF-κB] activation), autophagy (LC3-B puncta formation), and redox potential (NADH:NAD ratio). We identify microbiome-encoded bioactive metabolites, including commendamide and hydrogen sulfide and their associated biosynthetic genes, as well as a previously uncharacterized autophagy-inducing operon from Klebsiella spp. This work extends our understanding of microbial effector molecules that are known to influence host pathways. Parallel functional screening of metagenomic libraries can be easily expanded to investigate additional host processes.

Abstract: The development of efficient insulin producing cells (IPC) induction system is fundamental for the regenerative clinical applications targeting Diabetes Mellitus. This study was set to generate IPC from human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) capable of surviving under hypoxic conditions in vitro and in vivo.
Methods
hDPSCs were cultured in IPCs induction media augmented with Cerium or Yttrium oxide nanoparticles along with selected growth factors & cytokines. The generated IPC were subjected to hypoxic stress in vitro to evaluate the ability of the nanoparticles to combat hypoxia. Next, they were labelled and implanted into diabetic rats. Twenty eight days later, blood glucose and serum insulin levels, hepatic hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were measured. Pancreatic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), pancreatic duodenal homeobox1 (Pdx-1), hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and Caspase-3 genes expression level were evaluated.
Results
hDPSCs were successfully differentiated into IPCs after incubation with the inductive media enriched with nanoparticles. The generated IPCs released significant amounts of insulin in response to increasing glucose concentration both in vitro & in vivo. The generated IPCs showed up-regulation in the expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes in concomitant with down-regulation in the expression levels of hypoxic, and apoptotic genes. The in vivo study confirmed the homing of PKH-26-labeled cells in pancreas of treated groups. A significant up-regulation in the expression of pancreatic VEGF and PDX-1 genes associated with significant down-regulation in the expression of pancreatic HIF-1α and caspase-3 was evident.
Conclusion
The achieved results highlight the promising role of the Cerium & Yttrium oxide nanoparticles in promoting the generation of IPCs that have the ability to combat hypoxia and govern diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Summary
Cold-induced thermogenesis in endotherms demands adaptive thermogenesis fueled by mitochondrial respiration and Ucp1-mediated uncoupling in multilocular brown adipocytes (BAs). However, dietary regulation of thermogenesis in BAs isn’t fully understood. Here, we describe that the deficiency of Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing-protein (Lrpprc) in BAs reduces mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression, causes ETC proteome imbalance, and abolishes the mitochondria-fueled thermogenesis. BA-specific Lrpprc knockout mice are cold resistant in a 4°C cold-tolerance test in the presence of food, which is accompanied by the activation of transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and proteome turnover in BAs. ATF4 activation genetically by BA-specific ATF4 overexpression or physiologically by a low-protein diet feeding can improve cold tolerance in wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice. Furthermore, ATF4 activation in BAs improves systemic metabolism in obesogenic environment regardless of Ucp1’s action. Therefore, our study reveals a diet-dependent but Ucp1-independent thermogenic mechanism in BAs that is relevant to systemic thermoregulation and energy homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Current coronavirus (CoV) vaccines primarily target immunodominant epitopes in the S1 subunit, which are poorly conserved and susceptible to escape mutations, thus threatening vaccine efficacy. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to remove the S1 subunit from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein and develop stabilized stem (SS) antigens. Vaccination with MERS SS elicits cross-reactive β-CoV antibody responses and protects mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. High-throughput screening of antibody-secreting cells from MERS SS-immunized mice led to the discovery of a panel of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. Among them, antibody IgG22 binds with high affinity to both MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 S proteins, and a combination of electron microscopy and crystal structures localizes the epitope to a conserved coiled-coil region in the S2 subunit. Passive transfer of IgG22 protects mice against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Collectively, these results provide a proof of principle for cross-reactive CoV antibodies and inform the development of pan-CoV vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid alternations between exploration and defensive reactions require ongoing risk assessment. How visual cues and internal states flexibly modulate the selection of behaviors remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN)—a major retinorecipient structure—is a critical node in the network controlling defensive behaviors to visual threats. We find that vLGNGABA neuron activity scales with the intensity of environmental illumination and is modulated by behavioral state. Chemogenetic activation of vLGNGABA neurons reduces freezing, whereas inactivation dramatically extends the duration of freezing to visual threats. Perturbations of vLGN activity disrupt exploration in brightly illuminated environments. We describe both a vLGN→nucleus reuniens (Re) circuit and a vLGN→superior colliculus (SC) circuit, which exert opposite influences on defensive responses. These findings reveal roles for genetic- and projection-defined vLGN subpopulations in modulating the expression of behavioral threat responses according to internal state.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer that contains membrane proteins such as spike, responsible for target-cell binding and virus fusion. We found that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, spike becomes lipid modified, through the sequential action of the S-acyltransferases ZDHHC20 and 9. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics, and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid nanodomains in the early Golgi, where viral budding occurs. Finally, S-acylation of spike allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity. Our study points toward S-acylating enzymes and lipid biosynthesis enzymes as novel therapeutic anti-viral targets.

Abstract: Summary
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) results from a complex interplay of damage to the sensory cells of the inner ear, dysfunction of its lateral wall, axonal retraction of type 1C spiral ganglion neurons, and activation of the immune response. We use RiboTag and single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the cell-type-specific molecular landscape of the mouse inner ear before and after noise trauma. We identify induction of the transcription factors STAT3 and IRF7 and immune-related genes across all cell-types. Yet, cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes dominate the response. The ATF3/ATF4 stress-response pathway is robustly induced in the type 1A noise-resilient neurons, potassium transport genes are downregulated in the lateral wall, mRNA metabolism genes are downregulated in outer hair cells, and deafness-associated genes are downregulated in most cell types. This transcriptomic resource is available via the Gene Expression Analysis Resource (gEAR; https://umgear.org/NIHL) and provides a blueprint for the rational development of drugs to prevent and treat NIHL.

Abstract: Summary
Deconvolution of regulatory mechanisms that drive transcriptional programs in cancer cells is key to understanding tumor biology. Herein, we present matched transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution from human ovarian and endometrial tumors processed immediately following surgical resection. This dataset reveals the complex cellular heterogeneity of these tumors and enabled us to quantitatively link variation in chromatin accessibility to gene expression. We show that malignant cells acquire previously unannotated regulatory elements to drive hallmark cancer pathways. Moreover, malignant cells from within the same patients show substantial variation in chromatin accessibility linked to transcriptional output, highlighting the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity. Finally, we infer the malignant cell type-specific activity of transcription factors. By defining the regulatory logic of cancer cells, this work reveals an important reliance on oncogenic regulatory elements and highlights the ability of matched scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq to uncover clinically relevant mechanisms of tumorigenesis in gynecologic cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) are antiviral defense operons that protect bacteria from phage replication. Here, we discover a widespread class of CBASS transmembrane (TM) effector proteins that respond to antiviral nucleotide signals and limit phage propagation through direct membrane disruption. Crystal structures of the Yersinia TM effector Cap15 reveal a compact 8-stranded β-barrel scaffold that forms a cyclic dinucleotide receptor domain that oligomerizes upon activation. We demonstrate that activated Cap15 relocalizes throughout the cell and specifically induces rupture of the inner membrane. Screening for active effectors, we identify the function of distinct families of CBASS TM effectors and demonstrate that cell death via disruption of inner-membrane integrity is a common mechanism of defense. Our results reveal the function of the most prominent class of effector protein in CBASS immunity and define disruption of the inner membrane as a widespread strategy of abortive infection in bacterial phage defense.

Abstract: Summary
piRNAs guide Piwi/Panoramix-dependent H3K9me3 chromatin modification and transposon silencing during Drosophila germline development. The THO RNA export complex is composed of Hpr1, Tho2, and Thoc5–7. Null thoc7 mutations, which displace Thoc5 and Thoc6 from a Tho2-Hpr1 subcomplex, reduce expression of a subset of germline piRNAs and increase transposon expression, suggesting that THO silences transposons by promoting piRNA biogenesis. Here, we show that the thoc7-null mutant combination increases transposon transcription but does not reduce anti-sense piRNAs targeting half of the transcriptionally activated transposon families. These mutations also fail to reduce piRNA-guided H3K9me3 chromatin modification or block Panoramix-dependent silencing of a reporter transgene, and unspliced transposon transcripts co-precipitate with THO through a Piwi- and Panoramix-independent mechanism. Mutations in piwi also dominantly enhance germline defects associated with thoc7-null alleles. THO thus functions in a piRNA-independent transposon-silencing pathway, which acts cooperatively with Piwi to support germline development.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity is tightly regulated by cellular redox status, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Protein S-nitrosylation, the nitric-oxide-mediated cysteine thiol protein modification, plays important roles in cellular redox regulation. Here we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) and acute cold exposure elevate BAT protein S-nitrosylation, including UCP1. This thermogenic-induced nitric oxide bioactivity is regulated by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR; alcohol dehydrogenase 5 [ADH5]), a denitrosylase that balances the intracellular nitroso-redox status. Loss of ADH5 in BAT impairs cold-induced UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and worsens obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Adh5 expression is induced by the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and administration of an HSF1 activator to BAT of DIO mice increases Adh5 expression and significantly improves UCP1-mediated respiration. Together, these data indicate that ADH5 controls BAT nitroso-redox homeostasis to regulate adipose thermogenesis, which may be therapeutically targeted to improve metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
Currently, many genetic methods are available for mapping chemical connectivity, but analogous methods for electrical synapses are lacking. Here, we present pupylation-based interaction labeling (PUPIL), a genetically encoded system for noninvasively mapping and stamping transient electrical synapses in the mouse brain. Upon fusion of connexin 26 (CX26) with the ligase PafA, pupylation yields tag puncta following conjugation of its substrate, a biotin- or fluorescent-protein-tagged PupE, to the neighboring proteins of electrical synapses containing CX26-PafA. Tag puncta are validated to correlate well with functional electrical synapses in immature neurons. Furthermore, puncta are retained in mature neurons when electrical synapses mostly disappear—suggesting successful stamping. We use PUPIL to uncover spatial subcellular localizations of electrical synapses and approach their physiological functions during development. Thus, PUPIL is a powerful tool for probing electrical connectivity patterns in complex nervous systems and has great potential for transient receptors and ion channels as well.

Abstract: Summary
Human ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 (UQCRC1) is an evolutionarily conserved core subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. We recently identified the disease-associated variants of UQCRC1 from patients with familial parkinsonism, but its function remains unclear. Here we investigate the endogenous function of UQCRC1 in the human neuronal cell line and the Drosophila nervous system. Flies with neuronal knockdown of uqcrc1 exhibit age-dependent parkinsonism-resembling defects, including dopaminergic neuron reduction and locomotor decline, and are ameliorated by UQCRC1 expression. Lethality of uqcrc1-KO is also rescued by neuronally expressing UQCRC1, but not the disease-causing variant, providing a platform to discern the pathogenicity of this mutation. Furthermore, UQCRC1 associates with the apoptosis trigger cytochrome c (cyt-c), and uqcrc1 deficiency increases cyt-c in the cytoplasmic fraction and activates the caspase cascade. Depleting cyt-c or expression of the anti-apoptotic p35 ameliorates uqcrc1-mediated neurodegeneration. Our findings identify a role for UQCRC1 in regulating cyt-c-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The dense variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat of African trypanosomes represents the primary host-pathogen interface. Antigenic variation prevents clearing of the pathogen by employing a large repertoire of antigenically distinct VSG genes, thus neutralizing the host’s antibody response. To explore the epitope space of VSGs, we generate anti-VSG nanobodies and combine high-resolution structural analysis of VSG-nanobody complexes with binding assays on living cells, revealing that these camelid antibodies bind deeply inside the coat. One nanobody causes rapid loss of cellular motility, possibly due to blockage of VSG mobility on the coat, whose rapid endocytosis and exocytosis are mechanistically linked to Trypanosoma brucei propulsion and whose density is required for survival. Electron microscopy studies demonstrate that this loss of motility is accompanied by rapid formation and shedding of nanovesicles and nanotubes, suggesting that increased protein crowding on the dense membrane can be a driving force for membrane fission in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
Nearly one-third of proteins are initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where they are correctly folded and then delivered to their final cellular destinations. To prevent the accumulation of misfolded membrane proteins, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) moves these clients from the ER membrane to the cytosol, a process known as retrotranslocation. Our recent work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals a derlin rhomboid pseudoprotease, Dfm1, is involved in the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated ERAD membrane substrates. In this study, we identify conserved residues of Dfm1 that are critical for retrotranslocation. We find several retrotranslocation-deficient Loop 1 mutants that display impaired binding to membrane substrates. Furthermore, Dfm1 possesses lipid thinning function to facilitate in the removal of ER membrane substrates, and this feature is conserved in its human homolog, Derlin-1, further implicating that derlin-mediated retrotranslocation is a well-conserved process.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms of Myc-driven liver tumorigenesis are inadequately understood. Herein we show that Myc-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dramatically aggravated in mice with hepatocyte-specific Ptpn11/Shp2 deletion. However, Myc-induced tumors develop selectively from the rare Shp2-positive hepatocytes in Shp2-deficent liver, and Myc-driven oncogenesis depends on an intact Ras-Erk signaling promoted by Shp2 to sustain Myc stability. Despite a stringent requirement of Shp2 cell autonomously, Shp2 deletion induces an immunosuppressive environment, resulting in defective clearance of tumor-initiating cells and aggressive tumor progression. The basal Wnt/β-catenin signaling is upregulated in Shp2-deficient liver, which is further augmented by Myc transfection. Ablating Ctnnb1 suppresses Myc-induced HCC in Shp2-deficient livers, revealing an essential role of β-catenin. Consistently, Myc overexpression and CTNNB1 mutations are frequently co-detected in HCC patients with poor prognosis. These data elucidate complex mechanisms of liver tumorigenesis driven by cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling in cooperation with a tumor-promoting microenvironment generated by disrupting the specific oncogenic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The function of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in myelination and remyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) remains enigmatic. Here, we report that PARP1 is an intrinsic driver for oligodendroglial development and myelination. Genetic PARP1 depletion impairs the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes and impedes CNS myelination. Mechanistically, PARP1-mediated PARylation activity is not only necessary but also sufficient for OPC differentiation. At the molecular level, we identify the RNA-binding protein Myef2 as a PARylated target, which controls OPC differentiation through the PARylation-modulated derepression of myelin protein expression. Furthermore, PARP1’s enzymatic activity is necessary for oligodendrocyte and myelin regeneration after demyelination. Together, our findings suggest that PARP1-mediated PARylation activity may be a potential therapeutic target for promoting OPC differentiation and remyelination in neurological disorders characterized by arrested OPC differentiation and remyelination failure such as multiple sclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacterial pathogens secrete A(2)B5 toxins comprising two functionally distinct yet complementary “A” and “B” subunits to benefit the pathogens during infection. The lectin-like pentameric B subunits recognize specific sets of host glycans to deliver the toxin into target host cells. Here, we offer the molecular mechanism by which neutralizing antibodies, which have the potential to bind to all glycan-receptor binding sites and thus completely inhibit toxin binding to host cells, are inhibited from exerting this action. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)-based analyses indicate that the skewed positioning of the toxin A subunit(s) toward one side of the toxin B pentamer inhibited neutralizing antibody binding to the laterally located epitopes, rendering some glycan-receptor binding sites that remained available for the toxin binding and endocytosis process, which is strikingly different from the counterpart antibodies recognizing the far side-located epitopes. These results highlight additional features of the toxin-antibody interactions and offer important insights into anti-toxin strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbial diversity decreases with aging, but existing studies have used stool samples, which do not represent the entire gut. We analyzed the duodenal microbiome in 251 subjects aged 18–35 (n = 32), 36–50 (n = 41), 51–65 (n = 96), and 66–80 (n = 82). Decreased duodenal microbial diversity in older subjects is associated with combinations of chronological age, number of concomitant diseases, and number of medications used, and also correlated with increasing coliform numbers (p < 0.0001). Relative abundance (RA) of phylum Proteobacteria increases in older subjects, with increased RA of family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera Escherichia and Klebsiella, and is associated with alterations in the RA of other duodenal microbial taxa and decreased microbial diversity. Increased RA of specific genera are associated with chronological age only (Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus), number of medications only (Klebsiella), or number of concomitant diseases only (Clostridium and Bilophila). These findings indicate the small intestinal microbiome changes significantly with age and the aging process.

Abstract: Summary
The ring-like structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex MukBEF folds the genome of Escherichia coli and related bacteria into large loops, presumably by active DNA loop extrusion. MukBEF activity within the replication terminus macrodomain is suppressed by the sequence-specific unloader MatP. Here, we present the complete atomic structure of MukBEF in complex with MatP and DNA as determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). The complex binds two distinct DNA double helices corresponding to the arms of a plectonemic loop. MatP-bound DNA threads through the MukBEF ring, while the second DNA is clamped by the kleisin MukF, MukE, and the MukB ATPase heads. Combinatorial cysteine cross-linking confirms this topology of DNA loop entrapment in vivo. Our findings illuminate how a class of near-ubiquitous DNA organizers with important roles in genome maintenance interacts with the bacterial chromosome.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARPi) have entered the clinic for the treatment of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cancers. Despite the success of this approach, preclinical and clinical research with PARPi has revealed multiple resistance mechanisms, highlighting the need for identification of novel functional biomarkers and combination treatment strategies. Functional genetic screens performed in cells and organoids that acquired resistance to PARPi by loss of 53BP1 identified loss of LIG3 as an enhancer of PARPi toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. Enhancement of PARPi toxicity by LIG3 depletion is dependent on BRCA1 deficiency but independent of the loss of 53BP1 pathway. Mechanistically, we show that LIG3 loss promotes formation of MRE11-mediated post-replicative ssDNA gaps in BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1/53BP1 double-deficient cells exposed to PARPi, leading to an accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. LIG3 depletion also enhances efficacy of PARPi against BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors in mice, suggesting LIG3 as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Atg6Beclin 1 mediates autophagy and endosomal trafficking. We investigated how Atg6 influences replication stress. Combining genetic, genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic approaches, we found that the Vps34-Vps15-Atg6Beclin 1-Vps38UVRAG-phosphatydilinositol-3 phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) axis sensitizes cells to replication stress by favoring the degradation of plasma membrane amino acid (AA) transporters via endosomal trafficking and ESCRT proteins, while the PtdIns(3)P phosphatases Ymr1 and Inp53 promote survival to replication stress by reversing this process. An impaired AA uptake triggers activation of Gcn2, which attenuates protein synthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α. Mec1Atr-Rad53Chk1/Chk2 activation during replication stress further hinders translation efficiency by counteracting eIF2α dephosphorylation through Glc7PP1. AA shortage-induced hyperphosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits the synthesis of 65 stress response proteins, thus resulting in cell sensitization to replication stress, while TORC1 promotes cell survival. Our findings reveal an integrated network mediated by endosomal trafficking, translational control pathways, and checkpoint kinases linking AA availability to the response to replication stress.

Abstract: Summary
Recognition of N-linked glycan at residue N276 (glycan276) at the periphery of the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-envelope trimer is a formidable challenge for many CD4bs-directed antibodies. To understand how this glycan can be recognized, here we isolate two lineages of glycan276-dependent CD4bs antibodies. Antibody CH540-VRC40.01 (named for donor-lineage.clone) neutralizes 81% of a panel of 208 diverse strains, while antibody CH314-VRC33.01 neutralizes 45%. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of these two antibodies and 179NC75, a previously identified glycan276-dependent CD4bs antibody, in complex with HIV-envelope trimer reveal substantially different modes of glycan276 recognition. Despite these differences, binding of glycan276-dependent antibodies maintains a glycan276 conformation similar to that observed in the absence of glycan276-binding antibodies. By contrast, glycan276-independent CD4bs antibodies, such as VRC01, displace glycan276 upon binding. These results provide a foundation for understanding antibody recognition of glycan276 and suggest its presence may be crucial for priming immunogens seeking to initiate broad CD4bs recognition.

Abstract: Histopathological images are widely used to diagnose diseases including skin cancer. As digital histopathological images are typically of very large size, in the order of several billion pixels, automated identification of all abnormal cell nuclei and their distribution within multiple tissue sections would assist rapid comprehensive diagnostic assessment. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based technique to segment the melanoma regions in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathological images. In this technique, the nuclei in the image are first segmented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The segmented nuclei are then used to generate melanoma region masks. Experimental results with a small melanoma dataset show that the proposed method can potentially segment the nuclei with more than 94 % accuracy and segment the melanoma regions with a Dice coefficient of around 85 %. The proposed technique also has a small execution time making it suitable for clinical diagnosis with a fast turnaround time.

Abstract: Summary
Paternal exposure to environmental stressors elicits distinct changes to the sperm sncRNA profile, modifications that have significant post-fertilization consequences. Despite this knowledge, there remains limited mechanistic understanding of how paternal exposures modify the sperm sncRNA landscape. Here, we report the acute sensitivity of the sperm sncRNA profile to the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Furthermore, we trace the differential accumulation of acrylamide-responsive sncRNAs to coincide with sperm transit of the proximal (caput) segment of the epididymis, wherein acrylamide exposure alters the abundance of several transcription factors implicated in the expression of acrylamide-sensitive sncRNAs. We also identify extracellular vesicles secreted from the caput epithelium in relaying altered sncRNA profiles to maturing spermatozoa and dysregulated gene expression during early embryonic development following fertilization by acrylamide-exposed spermatozoa. These data provide mechanistic links to account for how environmental insults can alter the sperm epigenome and compromise the transcriptomic profile of early embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that neurodevelopmental alterations might contribute to increase the susceptibility to develop neurodegenerative diseases. We investigate the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in dopaminergic neurons in a model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We monitor the differentiation of human patient-specific neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) into dopaminergic neurons. Using high-throughput image analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing, we observe that the PD-associated LRRK2-G2019S mutation alters the initial phase of neuronal differentiation by accelerating cell-cycle exit with a concomitant increase in cell death. We identify the NESC-specific core regulatory circuit and a molecular mechanism underlying the observed phenotypes. The expression of NR2F1, a key transcription factor involved in neurogenesis, decreases in LRRK2-G2019S NESCs, neurons, and midbrain organoids compared to controls. We also observe accelerated dopaminergic differentiation in vivo in NR2F1-deficient mouse embryos. This suggests a pathogenic mechanism involving the LRRK2-G2019S mutation, where the dynamics of dopaminergic differentiation are modified via NR2F1.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs (sRNAs) are important gene regulators in bacteria. Many sRNAs act post-transcriptionally by affecting translation and degradation of the target mRNAs upon base-pairing interactions. Here we present a general approach combining imaging and mathematical modeling to determine kinetic parameters at different levels of sRNA-mediated gene regulation that contribute to overall regulation efficacy. Our data reveal that certain sRNAs previously characterized as post-transcriptional regulators can regulate some targets co-transcriptionally, leading to a revised model that sRNA-mediated regulation can occur early in an mRNA’s lifetime, as soon as the sRNA binding site is transcribed. This co-transcriptional regulation is likely mediated by Rho-dependent termination when transcription-coupled translation is reduced upon sRNA binding. Our data also reveal several important kinetic steps that contribute to the differential regulation of mRNA targets by an sRNA.

Abstract: Summary
The current paradigm for data use oversight of biomedical datasets is onerous, extending the timescale and resources needed to obtain access for secondary analyses, thus hindering scientific discovery. For a researcher to utilize a controlled-access dataset, a data access committee must review her research plans to determine whether they are consistent with the data use limitations (DULs) specified by the informed consent form. The newly created GA4GH data use ontology (DUO) holds the potential to streamline this process by making data use oversight computable. Here, we describe an open-source software platform, the Data Use Oversight System (DUOS), that connects with DUO terminology to enable automated data use oversight. We analyze dbGaP data acquired since 2006, finding an exponential increase in data access requests, which will not be sustainable with current manual oversight review. We perform an empirical evaluation of DUOS and DUO on selected datasets from the Broad Institute’s data repository. We were able to structure 118/123 of the evaluated DULs (96%) and 52/52 (100%) of research proposals using DUO terminology, and we find that DUOS’ automated data access adjudication in all cases agreed with the DAC manual review. This first empirical evaluation of the feasibility of automated data use oversight demonstrates comparable accuracy to human-based data access oversight in real-world data governance.

Abstract: Summary
The global impact of somatic structural variants (SVs) on gene regulation in advanced tumors with complex treatment histories has been mostly uncharacterized. Here, using whole-genome and RNA sequencing from 570 recurrent or metastatic tumors, we report the altered expression of hundreds of genes in association with nearby SV breakpoints, including oncogenes and G-protein-coupled receptor-related genes such as PLEKHG2. A significant fraction of genes with SV-expression associations correlate with worse patient survival in primary and advanced cancers, including SRD5A1. In many instances, SV-expression associations involve retrotransposons being translocated near genes. High overall SV burden is associated with treatment with DNA alkylating agents or taxanes and altered expression of metabolism-associated genes. SV-expression associations within tumors from topoisomerase I inhibitor-treated patients include chromatin-related genes. Within anthracycline-treated tumors, SV breakpoints near chromosome 1p genes include PDE4B. Patient treatment and history can help understand the widespread SV-mediated cis-regulatory alterations found in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
SARM1 is an inducible TIR-domain NAD+ hydrolase that mediates pathological axon degeneration. SARM1 is activated by an increased ratio of NMN to NAD+, which competes for binding to an allosteric activating site. When NMN binds, the TIR domain is released from autoinhibition, activating its NAD+ hydrolase activity. The discovery of this allosteric activating site led us to hypothesize that other NAD+-related metabolites might activate SARM1. Here, we show the nicotinamide analog 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP), first identified as a neurotoxin in the 1940s, is converted to 3-APMN, which activates SARM1 and induces SARM1-dependent NAD+ depletion, axon degeneration, and neuronal death. In mice, systemic treatment with 3-AP causes rapid SARM1-dependent death, while local application to the peripheral nerve induces SARM1-dependent axon degeneration. We identify 2-aminopyridine as another SARM1-dependent neurotoxin. These findings identify SARM1 as a candidate mediator of environmental neurotoxicity and suggest that SARM1 agonists could be developed into selective agents for neurolytic therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are highly heterogeneous. With the lack of a comprehensive understanding of CAFs' functional distinctions, it remains unclear how cancer treatments could be personalized based on CAFs in a patient's tumor. We have established a living biobank of CAFs derived from biopsies of patients' non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) that encompasses a broad molecular spectrum of CAFs in clinical NSCLC. By functionally interrogating CAF heterogeneity using the same therapeutics received by patients, we identify three functional subtypes: (1) robustly protective of cancers and highly expressing HGF and FGF7; (2) moderately protective of cancers and highly expressing FGF7; and (3) those providing minimal protection. These functional differences among CAFs are governed by their intrinsic TGF-β signaling, which suppresses HGF and FGF7 expression. This CAF functional classification correlates with patients' clinical response to targeted therapies and also associates with the tumor immune microenvironment, therefore providing an avenue to guide personalized treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, causing defects of social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Here, we identify a de novo heterozygous gene-truncating mutation of the Sentrin-specific peptidase1 (SENP1) gene in people with ASD without neurodevelopmental delay. We find that Senp1+/− mice exhibit core autistic-like symptoms such as social deficits and repetitive behaviors but normal learning and memory ability. Moreover, we find that inhibitory and excitatory synaptic functions are severely affected in the retrosplenial agranular (RSA) cortex of Senp1+/− mice. Lack of Senp1 leads to increased SUMOylation and degradation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), also implicated in syndromic ASD. Importantly, re-introducing SENP1 or FMRP specifically in RSA fully rescues the defects of synaptic function and autistic-like symptoms of Senp1+/− mice. Together, these results demonstrate that disruption of the SENP1-FMRP regulatory axis in the RSA causes autistic symptoms, providing a candidate region for ASD pathophysiology.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms regulating exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and responsiveness to PD-1 blockade remain partly unknown. In human ovarian cancer, we show that tumor-specific CD8+ TIL accumulate in tumor islets, where they engage antigen and upregulate PD-1, which restrains their functions. Intraepithelial PD-1+CD8+ TIL can be, however, polyfunctional. PD-1+ TIL indeed exhibit a continuum of exhaustion states, with variable levels of CD28 costimulation, which is provided by antigen-presenting cells (APC) in intraepithelial tumor myeloid niches. CD28 costimulation is associated with improved effector fitness of exhausted CD8+ TIL and is required for their activation upon PD-1 blockade, which also requires tumor myeloid APC. Exhausted TIL lacking proper CD28 costimulation in situ fail to respond to PD-1 blockade, and their response may be rescued by local CTLA-4 blockade and tumor APC stimulation via CD40L.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of cell fate in the CD8+ T cell response to infection. Although there are several examples of miRNAs acting on effector CD8+ T cells after infection, it is unclear whether differential expression of one or more miRNAs in the naive state is consequential in altering their long-term trajectory. To answer this question, we examine the role of miR-29 in neonatal and adult CD8+ T cells, which express different amounts of miR-29 only prior to infection and adopt profoundly different fates after immune challenge. We find that manipulation of miR-29 expression in the naive state is sufficient for age-adjusting the phenotype and function of CD8+ T cells, including their regulatory landscapes and long-term differentiation trajectories after infection. Thus, miR-29 acts as a developmental switch by controlling the balance between a rapid effector response in neonates and the generation of long-lived memory in adults.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile acids (BAs) play an important role in energy balance and host metabolism via G protein-coupled receptors and/or nuclear receptors. Emerging evidence suggests that BAs are important for maintaining innate immune responses via these receptors. However, the effect of BAs on autoimmune uveitis is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate decreased microbiota-related secondary BA concentration in feces and serum of animals with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Restoration of the gut BAs pool attenuates severity of EAU in association with inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-related pro-inflammatory cytokines in dendritic cells (DCs). TGR5 deficiency partially reverses the inhibitory effect of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on DCs. TGR5 signaling also inhibits NF-κB activation via the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in DCs. Additionally, both DCA and TGR5 agonists inhibit human monocyte-derived DC activation. Taken together, our results suggest that BA metabolism plays an important role in adaptive immune responses and might be a therapeutic target in autoimmune uveitis.
