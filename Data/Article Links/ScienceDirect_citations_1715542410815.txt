Abstract: A cross-talk between androgen/androgen receptor signaling and the AP-1 transcription factor has been proposed. In this study, we asked whether activation of AP-1 modifies androgen-responsive gene transcription, and whether androgens effect AP-1-regulated gene transcription. We show that activation of AP-1 via expression of a constitutively active mutant of mitogen-activated/extracellular signal responsive kinase kinase (MEK) kinase-1 did not increase the activity of the androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Likewise, expression of a constitutively active mutant of the transcription factor c-Jun, which is a major constitutent of AP-1, did not increase the activity of the probasin promoter. In contrast, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) activated both the probasin promoter and the AP-1-regulated collagenase promoter in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The AP-1 binding site within the collagenase promoter was identified as DHT-responsive element. In line with this, DHT increased the activities of the c-Jun promoter and the tumor necrosis factor alpha promoter, which both contain AP-1 binding sites. The signal transduction pathway coupling DHT stimulation with AP-1 activation required c-Jun, MAP kinases and androgen receptors, but was independent of transient receptor potential melastatin-8 (TRPM8) channels, proposed to function as ionotropic testosterone receptors. Expression of the GTPase activating protein RGS2 attenuated DHT-induced activation of AP-1, indicating that the DHT-induced signaling cascade involves G proteins.

Abstract: Nanostructured mesoporous Ni-PANI thin film electrodes are fabricated on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass substrates using a pulse potential electro-polymerization technique. The Ni-PANI film is amorphous in nature and exhibits a mesoporous cauliflower like morphology. The multifunctional characteristics of Ni-PANI as an electrode for a smart supercapacitor are investigated using electrochemical and optical techniques in 0.5 M LiClO4 +PC electrolyte. It is dark blue when it is charged at 0.7 V (vs SCE), and it is transparent when it is discharged at −0.7 V (vs SCE). Moreover, it can exhibit other colours like sky blue and parrot green in intermediate states. Specific discharge capacitance of 543 Fg−1 and 267 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 is obtained for Ni-PANI and pure PANI respectively. The observed colouration efficiency is 45.9 cm2C−1 for Ni-PANI and 35.1 cm2C−1 for pure PANI at a wavelength of 630 nm. An outstanding optical modulation of 55.6% with a capacity retention of 90% after 5000 cycles is obtained for Ni-PANI electrode. The robust synthesis of Ni-PANI electrodes with efficient smart supercapacitor activity can be used as alternative materials in smart energy storage devices.

Abstract: In this work the influence of unstructured charge-extraction/transport layers on solar cell photocurrent measurements is investigated. Photovoltaic cells incorporating unstructured conductive layers exhibit a significant amount of photoactive area spreading. This can lead to a large error in determining solar cell short circuit current density and fill factor from I-V measurements. To counteract this effect an analytical model is developed to describe the photoactive area spreading. The developed model requires only solar cell contact geometry and transport layer sheet resistance in order to calculate the spreading current from measured I-V data. Thus total removal of unwanted spreading current from experimental data and calculation of realistic solar cell efficiency is achieved. As an example this model is applied to unstructured metal mesh based organic solar cells, and presented data show that it yields more accurate results compared to the conventional shadow masking approach.

Abstract: In this study, the fabrication and structural characterization of Antimony (Sb) doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO) based interdigitated Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors are reported. Sb doped p-ZnO nanostructures were grown using the sol-gel and hydrothermal methods on flexible ITO/PET substrates. Aluminium (Al) interdigitated contacts of thickness 20 nm, were deposited using the thermal evaporation technique to realise planar MSM structures. The structural morphology and element analysis of the as-prepared samples were studied using XRD, FESEM and EDS methods. At an applied magnetic field of 1 T, the Hall measurements revealed that the device had a resistivity of 2.0697 × 10−3 Ω·cm, a hole mobility of 1922 m2/(V·s), and hole concentration of 0.1571 × 1019 cm−3. The optoelectrical characterization (without and with 365 nm of UV light) was performed on the MSM photodetectors with different finger electrode spacing i.e. gap sizes (0.1 cm, 0.2 cm and 0.3 cm). The results show that the device with finger spacing of 0.1 cm exhibited the maximum photocurrent. The responsivity and external-quantum-efficiency were calculated as 3.797 A/W and 1292% respectively. The flexible device was subjected to mechanical stress, and the dark current and photocurrent were measured for various bending/ convex arc angles (29.98⁰, 48.72⁰, 64.96⁰ and 97.45⁰). It was observed that the dark current and photocurrent reduce with the increase in bending angles. The current values were reproducible even with repeated flexing and relaxing of the device. This proved that the adhesion of the active layer of Sb doped p-ZnO to the ITO/PET substrate is good, which makes it a good device.

Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BVO) as one of the promising photoanodes suffers from low charge transport mobility and conductivity. Here, dip coating of successive layers of bismuth vanadate (BVO) precursor were utilized to prepared BVO photoanode. Ag-doped BVO electrodes were also prepared by adding a trace amount of Ag+ in the bismuth vanadate precursor and codepositing Ag with the BVO film. In the Ag-doped BVO, Ag+ ions substitutionally replaced Bi3+ ions and increased the electron concentration in BVO. The photocurrent density and photoconductivity of Ag-doped BVO were monitored by changing the loading percentage of Ag (1–5%). At optimum Ag-doping percentage (2% Ag-doped BVO), the photocurrent density is found to be 5.5-fold greater than that of pure BVO. Deterministic investigation indicated that the enhanced PEC performance of the 2% Ag-BVO was attributed to significantly increased donor concentration (30-fold), greater visible light absorption, decreased recombination process of charge carriers (9-fold), thinner space charge layer (6-fold) and reduced flat band potential (16%). The water splitting experiment showed that the total generated H2 after 2 h of irradiation for 2% Ag-BVO was estimated as 5.2 μmol cm-2 and the equivalent value for O2 was 2.70 μmol cm-2.

Abstract: In this study, interfacial recombination observed by activation energy (Ea) is reduced with an improvement in the built-in potential (Vbi) by raising the conduction band minimum (EC) in Al-doped (Zn, Mg)O (AZMO) layer for pure-sulfide Cu(In, Ga)S2 (CIGS) solar cells. It is observed that the optical band gap in AZMO films can be widened from 3.56 to 3.97 eV with increasing Mg/(Mg + Zn) ratio from 0 to 0.23, suggesting the shift of EC toward the vacuum level. AZMO layers with Mg/(Mg + Zn) ratio of 0–0.23 are applied as transparent conductive oxide (TCO) for the pure-sulfide CIGS solar cells. The open-circuit voltage is clearly enhanced from 0.641 to 0.713 V with increasing Mg/(Mg + Zn) ratio from 0 to 0.09 and then decreased to 0.651 V at Mg/(Mg + Zn) ratio of 0.23 in the AZMO layer. Reverse saturation current density (J0) was minimized to 9.4 × 10−7 A/cm2 at Mg/(Mg + Zn) of 0.09, although J0 was 4.7 × 10−6 A/cm2 in Al-doped ZnO (Mg/(Mg + Zn) of 0). From Mott-Schottky plot, it is observed that Vbi for the pure-sulfide CIGS solar cells gradually enhanced with an increase in Mg/(Mg + Zn) from 0 to 0.23 in the AZMO layer. These results suggest that Vbi improves by controlling EC in the TCO layer, which ultimately reduces the recombination at the hetero interface owing to strengthened electric field.

Abstract: Concentrating solar thermal technologies have experienced an important boost in the last few years. Besides the production of electricity, they are particularly useful for the supply of industrial process heat. The industrial atmospheres affecting these solar plants typically contain gaseous pollutants that are likely to promote corrosion on the components of the solar facility, specifically solar reflectors, thereby compromising their optimal performance and the overall system efficiency. Seven accelerated aging tests were designed to study the effects of three air pollutants (H2S, SO2 and NO2) on the durability of two commercially available reflector types (silvered-glass and aluminum), both in single-gas tests and in multicomponent gas mixtures. Additionally, the same material types were exposed outdoors at five representative polluted sites, including industrial, urban and coastal environments. Reflectance and optical microscope monitoring corroborated which degree of corrosion was developed on a specific type of reflector in the different tests with gaseous pollutants, as well as the synergistic effects of gas combinations. For example, tests with sulfur were harmful for silvered-glass reflectors (up to a total of 16 corrosion spots), whereas aluminum was particularly affected by tests with NO2 (numerous micro spots of around 50 μm size). Moreover, comparisons of the corrosion patterns found in accelerated-aging and outdoor exposures revealed which laboratory test reproduced the different real polluted atmospheres in the most realistic way, which is the main goal of this work. For instance, the degradation found at Site 2 was reproduced by Test NO2+SO2, with an acceleration factor of 27.

Abstract: Recently, kesterite-based thin film solar cells (TFSCs) gained significant attention in the photovoltaic (PV) sector for their elemental earth abundancy and low toxicity. The emerging kesterite-based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) TFSCs have gained a steady rise to the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.6%, which is still significantly lower than its predecessor chalcopyrite Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) TFSCs. Relatively the low device efficiency in kesterite-based TFSCs is mainly observed due to the instability of back interface during the high temperature thermal annealing (HTTA) process. During the HTTA process the detrimental reactions at Mo/absorber create unsolicited defects like MoS(e)2 layer, secondary phases and voids which consequently reduce the device efficiency. The present review offers some deep insights of the back-contact interface and interface related defects, besides different solutions to overcome these defects in detail. The interfacial-defects like the formation of MoS(e)2 layer, secondary phases and voids at Mo/absorber interface are conversed broadly with their respective reaction mechanism. Moreover, the plausible band theory of back contact interface in the presence of interfacial MoS(e)2 layer and the criteria for ideal back contact are also addressed. In conclusion, this review envisions the contests and perception for achieving high efficiency in kesterite based TFSCs by signifying an improvement in back interface related defects.

Abstract: Clay minerals are excellent supporting materials to synthesize shape-stabilized phase change materials (ssPCMs) because of outstanding pore structure, excellent thermal stability, perfect organic compatibility and eco-friendly features. However, previous clay-based ssPCMs show very low thermal energy storage capacity due to little loading of working PCMs (<65 wt%). In this work, stearic acid (SA) encapsulated by two-dimensional montmorillonite nanosheets (MtNS) has been designed in order to form core-shell structural MtNS/SA composite PCMs with ultra-high core mass fraction and dramatic latent heat capacity. This study mainly investigates the effect of MtNS shell thickness on thermal energy storage performances, including latent heat, thermal transfer ability, shape stability and cycling performances. Self-assembly mechanism of MtNS/SA was attributed to that the positively charged MtNS strongly attached on the surface of negatively charged SA latex particles and formed a core-shell structure mainly through electrostatic interaction. The MtNS/SA composite showed very large latent heat capacity (184.88 J/g) due to encapsulation of massive SA (>85 wt%). Besides, the composite PCMs also displayed improved thermal transfer ability due to the combination of MtNS, which leads to outstanding thermal charging/discharging rate and excellent photo-thermal conversion efficiency. It was also found that the thinner the MtNS, the better the thermal conductivity and latent heat storage capacity. In addition, the MtNS/SA composites show thermal and structural stability, no leakage occurred even under the encapsulation of the thinnest MtNS shell. Also, the cycling performances of this composite PCMs are very outstanding owing to the effective protection of MtNS shell. Hence, this non-leaking and green MtNS/SA composite PCMs with high-performance heat storage properties can be applied in sustainable energy field.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage plays a vital role to solve the problems related to the intermittent nature of solar energy. Phase change materials (PCMs) have shown promising applications in different thermal energy storage systems. Cascaded Thermal Storage (CTS) PCMs (multiple PCMs in a descending order of their melting temperatures), added new advantages to the applications of PCMs in thermal energy storage systems. Solar water collectors (SWCs) that utilize PCMs have been used to achieve economic and environmental benefits via substituting large-scale demand of energy. This literature review focuses on the different developments of PCMs and CTSPCMs and their implementation in SWC storage tanks. The novel and most recent developments of PCMs and CTSPCMs utilized in solar storage tanks with SWCs, such as, multi-storage tank with cascaded PCM, packed bed storage units, different configurations of heat exchanger storage units, and other innovative storage tank designs, are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the existing studies that evaluated the PCM heat transfer improvement, thermal storage performance, thermodynamic optimization, and applications of cascaded thermal storage systems are also reviewed. The reviewed results in this work showed that the CTSPCM system can promote a significant improvement in the PCM heat transfer and stored rates of entransy, energy, and exergy, as well as lead to an increased storage energy and exergy efficiencies compared to the single stage PCM system. It is also revealed that: the multi-tank integrated with cascaded PCMs system is the best amongst the studied PCM storage tank systems within SWCs, for augmenting the storage capacity and improving the overall thermal efficiency of the water heating system. A noteworthy observations, important proportionalities, and future trends are also discussed for each technique.

Abstract: Fullerene-free organic photovoltaics have recently reached impressive power conversion efficiencies above 14% for single junctions, increasing their competitiveness with respect to alternative thin-film technologies. In most record devices, electron-donating conjugated polymers are combined with novel generation small molecule acceptors. All-polymer organic solar cells, on the other hand, still lag behind in efficiency, although they have specific advantages in terms of ink formulation and long-term operational stability. Another point of attention is the synthetic complexity of the active layer materials, notably on the side of the new acceptor molecules. Therefore, the present study focuses on the implementation of the stable and cost-effective perylene diimide structure as the key component of high-performance electron-accepting polymers. The synthesis, structural and optoelectronic characterization of four push-pull type copolymers containing the electron-deficient bis(perylene diimide) (bis-PDI) unit is reported, as well as the photovoltaic analysis of these acceptor materials in combination with a well-known donor polymer (PTB7-Th). The acceptor polymers differ in the electron-rich part of the alternating push-pull structure and their solar cell power conversion efficiencies range from 3.2 to 4.7%. The maximum efficiency - the best performance achieved with a bis-PDI polymer so far - is obtained for the structurally most simple polymer, containing merely thiophene as the electron-rich building block. Controlled degradation under blue light in air is monitored by the bleaching of the relevant UV–Vis absorption bands, demonstrating high stability for the bis-PDI-thiophene containing polymers as compared to some prototype small molecule acceptors (FBR and ITIC).

Abstract: To boost the energy conversion efficiency in a thin-film Si solar cell, the effect of applying simple and generalized Fibonacci and Thue-Morse quasi-periodic multilayers in the front and back sides have been investigated. The anti-reflection coating and the back reflector are composed of SiO2/TiO2 and SiO2/Si sequences, respectively and the obtained results are in a good agreement with previous studies. Also, a 2D square array photonic crystal with 12-fold basis has been introduced to enhance the optical path length and hence, the absorption probability for longer wavelengths due to excitation of higher-order diffraction modes. The study has been carried out using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods and the electrical characteristics have been obtained implementing the drift-diffusion. A reasonable enhancement of ~115% and more than 120% in the short circuit current density and conversion efficiency have been achieved, respectively in the optimized structure.

Abstract: Ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) is used as a passivating and tunneling layer in high efficiency passivated contact silicon (Si) wafer solar cells. In this work, the emitter surface passivation quality using a low-cost, low-temperature (40 °C), non-acidic and safe chemical oxide passivation process (named as NCPRE-oxide) grown using sodium hypochlorite solution is compared with other existing oxide growth or deposition processes such as dry thermal oxide, Radio Corporation of America standard clean-2 (RCA-2) chemical oxide, nitric acid based oxide, sulphuric acid based (Piranha) oxide, ozone based oxide and deposited oxide by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition on standard 6-inch textured Si wafers. All the oxides layers are capped with hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (SiNy:H) improve passivation of the n+-type Si surface. There is a substantial improvement in the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) for SiOx/SiNy:H stack on the phosphorous diffused pyramidal textured Si surface. Further, to compare the influence of NCPRE-oxide process with other oxide processes on the electrical performance of the final device, these different processes were included in the fabrication of large area industrial aluminum-back surface field (Al-BSF) solar cells. A comprehensive analysis based on ellipsometry for film thickness measurement, τeff measurement, cell current-voltage characteristics, photoluminescence imaging, internal quantum efficiency mapping, and front surface recombination velocity measurement is presented. The NCPRE-oxide process resulted in a similar improvement in passivation and cell efficiency as other oxide processes for Al-BSF cells. In addition, its low-cost, low thermal budget, easy waste disposal, and single-component nature make it viable for industrial scale implementation.

Abstract: Molten salts have extended applications in concentrated solar power (CSP) installations, both as heat transfer and energy storage materials. In this study, a set of Lennard-Jones interatomic parameters are introduced for simulating NaNO3 and KNO3, as well as their most frequently industrially used mixture the so-called solar-salt (60% NaNO3 – 40% KNO3). Local structures are studied via radial distribution functions. Furthermore, density, thermal conductivity, self-diffusivity, viscosity and surface tension are calculated, from melting to decomposition temperature, and compared with experimental data. The local structures are calculated with both existing and presented interatomic potentials and are found to be in excellent agreement. Additionally, density, viscosity and surface tension present minor differences from literature data. Thermal conductivity, in terms of absolute values is in the proximity of reported data but is questionable in terms of trend. Finally, self-diffusion coefficients declinate from measured values, but are similar in terms of trend. Results are found to be in good agreement. This work represents the first extended validated effort in modelling molten nitrate salts and their mixtures at elevated temperatures using a Lennard-Jones potential, providing new tools that can aid in the fundamental understanding of molten salt structures at the molecular scale.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel flexible solar air heater (FSAH) has been rationally designed and fully investigated by practical experiments. The main part of the FSAH is an integrated flexible warp-knitted spacer fabric composite, in which spacer filaments are coated with solar energy absorbing materials by the air spraying method. In this system, flexible spacer fabric composite not only works as a solar thermal energy harvesting layer, but also provides airflow channels for energy transmission. By comparison test, it is found that the outlet temperature and thermal efficiency of FSAH were improved by introducing nano-black carbon particles as solar energy absorbing materials coated on the surface of spacer filaments. An analysis of net energy gain and effective efficiency was then carried out and the best thermohydraulic performance of the as-fabricated FSAH was found at the mass flow velocity of 0.037 kg m−2 s−1. The optimization experiments demonstrated that with the increase of heater length, the outlet temperature and energy gain of FSAH increased, while their thermal efficiency and effective efficiency decreased. Furthermore, to reduce the heat losses from the top layer to the surrounding ambient, another layer of transparent spacer fabric composite was assembled with the FSAH as a thermal insulation layer and its thermal efficiency and effective efficiency were found to be increased by 20%.

Abstract: A major challenge facing silicon solar cells used in building-integrated concentrator photovoltaics (BICPV) is their reduced electrical response when exposed to light of short or long wavelengths. In an attempt to tackle this problem, single cell static CPV modules were fabricated with some of the devices containing rare earth doped compounds which were dispersed into the system in varying concentrations and geometries. Under a solar simulator at 1000 W/m2, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices improved up to 11.1% relative through the addition of these materials. At lower irradiances and compared to cells without concentrators, the relative efficiency gains were more pronounced and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements suggested spectral conversion was responsible for these enhancements. For a large scale BICPV system, a simple analysis showed cost per watt could fall by up to 8.1% and power output increased from 25.7 to 28.4 W/m2 through this approach.

Abstract: Highly transparent and conductive oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) electrodes comprising aluminum-doped zinc-oxide (AZO) and ultrathin Ag or oxygen (O2)-doped Ag (AgOx) metal layers were fabricated for use in thin-film silicon solar cells. The surface morphologies of the metal layers and the transparencies and conductivities of OMO electrodes were investigated near the percolation thickness values of the metal layers. The percolation metal thickness, which means the metal layer is morphologically continuous, could be used to optimize the transparent OMO electrode. Additionally, thin Ag-based OMO (AgOx OMO) with superior performance could be fabricated by adding O2. The optimized AgOx OMO electrodes yielded the highest average transmittance (Tavg) of 93.5% and the lowest average optical loss (OLavg) of 1.01% within 500–800 nm at the percolation thickness of ~6 nm, thus, maintaining low conductivity. These outcomes were superior to the responses of the percolated Ag OMO (Tavg = 87.2%; OLavg = 1.01%). Using the OMO structure at the rear electrode, transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin-film solar was fabricated for building integrated photovoltaic windows. The best figure-of-merit (FOM; equal to the product of Tavg and efficiency η) values of the OMO-based transparent solar cells could be obtained for percolated OMO structures. The cells using AgOx OMO (AgOx cells) performed better than the Ag cells; the best FOMs of AgOx and Ag cells were 140.8 (Tavg = 27.8%; η = 5.51%) and 104.6% (Tavg = 18.9%; η = 5.54%), respectively. These results could contribute to the development of high-performance transparent solar cells or optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: We have developed a low-voltage modulated inorganic electrochromic device using a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). UV-cured electrolytes with various ferrocene (Fc) concentrations of 0, 0.05, and 0.1 M were developed. The electrochromic evaluation of the device using an Fc concentration of 0.1 M indicated high transmittance changes of >60% under a low potential change of 2.5 V due to the Fc in the electrolyte assisting with ion transfer to thin films, resulting in the lowest resistance within the device. Moreover, this electrochromic device, with an excellent self-bleaching effect, showed improved transmittance by 37% for 2000 s. We have fabricated a large smart window with a size of 20 × 20 cm2 using the optimized conditions, with stable cyclic transmittance change up to 100 cycles upon a potential change of 2.5 V. Therefore, an electrochromic device with high transmittance difference and stable switching performance was successfully demonstrated using 0.1 M Fc-based SPE.

Abstract: We present a numerical simulation study of the effects of low-angle grain boundaries (GBs) in a single-crystal-like GaAs thin-film material on its photovoltaic performance. Here, 1D and 2D modeling are employed to simulate a solar-cell (SC) device based on the properties of single-crystal-like GaAs thin films grown on metal tape. Properties include minority carriers’ mobility, carrier lifetimes, and diffusion length. The 1D model, by incorporating a uniform biaxially textured GaAs compared to single crystal GaAs, predicts an efficiency ∼21% for average carrier lifetimes of 1 ns. This result is not consistent with an experimental results showing an efficiency of 4.3%. 1D simulation generally works well for the prediction of conventional crystalline SC I-V characteristics, but it fails for newly-developed single-crystal-like GaAs SC devices with different material properties and non-vertical device geometry. Hence, we develop a 2D model to study the effect of localized recombination centers in the material by defining different regions of defective low-angle grain boundaries and single crystalline intra-grains. The 2D model is comparable to the experimental results mainly due to its capability to consider localized material inhomogeneity and lateral carriers dynamic. The effect of grain boundary density on SC performance is studied by 2D modeling. Increasing the grain size of GaAs from 2 μm to 50 μm can improve efficiency from 4.8% to 12.3%. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) shows more sensitivity to varying grain boundary densities than other SC characteristic factors. The 2D model is also employed to study bulk passivation of GBs and suggests that an efficiency of ∼19.5% is achievable in the single-crystal-like GaAs SCs even with a small grain size of 2 μm, if effective grain boundary passivation is applied.

Abstract: Herein, we report the dual functionality of a single n-type gallium nitride (n-GaN) layer as an electron transporter and transparent conductor, which has applications in reusable organic solar cells. After silicon doping with an optimized electron concentration, thin-film layer of GaN showed exceptional electrical properties including charge carrier mobility of 161 cm2 V−1s−1, electrical conductivity of 1.4ⅹ106 S cm−1, and sheet resistance of 11.1 Ω cm−2. Organic solar cells based on n-GaN exhibited power conversion efficiency comparable to those based on a conventional ITO/ZnO bilayered cathode. Furthermore, the n-GaN substrates exhibited reusability; due to excellent chemical stability of n-GaN, the reconstructed organic solar cells maintained their initial performance after the substrates were recycled. We suggest a new type of reusable n-GaN cathode layer featuring an integrated electron transporting layer and transparent electrode.

Abstract: Salt hydrate based composite materials are promising to be used for long-term thermochemical heat storage. MgSO4-Zeolite 13x composite materials were prepared in the present work using the solution impregnation method to reveal detailed characteristics of salt hydrates-zeolite composite materials. The porous structure of the composite materials with different MgSO4 contents was characterized, and the adsorption ability and hydration state of MgSO4 of the composite materials under different relative humidities (RH) were investigated. The results show, although the porous surface area and the pore volume were reduced after the penetration of the MgSO4 salt, the water adsorption ability can still be increased. The water adsorption ability also depended highly on the RH. Besides, not all the MgSO4 formed the hydrate state of MgSO4·6H2O and no MgSO4·7H2O were detected even for the equilibrium adsorption at high RH of 80%. The composite with 8 wt% MgSO4 showed the best performance, and could be a promising thermochemical material for long-term heat storage.

Abstract: As diamond wire sawn (DWS) technique for multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si) becomes mainstream wafering technology in Si-based photovoltaic industry, metal assisted chemical etching (MACE) method will become a key technique to improve conversion efficiency. Due to the intrinsic characteristic of Ag nanoparticles precipitation reaction in solution in the first step of MACE, a large number of deep nanopores are produced on the surface of mc-Si wafer in the following etching step. The deep nanopores can lead to the degradation of mc-Si solar cell's performances. Thus, the influences of Ag-ion concentration in the first step of MACE on the solar cell's performances was carefully studied. It's found that with the increasing of Ag-ion concentration, the light trapping capabilities keeps improving. However, the solar cell's electric performances deteriorate dramatically when Ag-ion concentration reaches to a certain value. Optical and electrical simulation is performed to explain the influences of deep nanopores on the mc-Si solar cell's performances. It is found that there is an optimum Ag-ion concentration value to enhance the mc-Si solar cell's performances, and an efficiency of 18.94% is obtained for large size of 156.75 × 156.75 mm2 wafer. An absolute efficiency of 0.5% was improved as compared to the conventional acidic textured DWS mc-Si solar cell. It shows the necessity of controlling the Ag-ion concentration in the manufacture of black silicon.

Abstract: The accumulation of dust and soil on the surface of solar reflectors is an important factor reducing the effective use of solar energy, especially for concentrating solar power plants. In this study, we investigated glass-based mirrors exposed in the desert and mirrors soiled in the laboratory. We achieved artificial, controlled soiling with different soil types by use of an in-house dusting device and measured scattering, hemispherical and specular reflectance. Results showed that small-angle scattering due to dust is noticeable and severely reduces reflectance of mirrors with otherwise high specularity. Prominent result is a significant decrease of reflectance for increasing local solar incidence angles, for example from 0.91 at 8° incidence angle to 0.84 at 70° incidence angle. Therefore, we present a model to predict specular reflectance for different levels of cleanliness. The model applies the Lambert-Beer law and relates the incidence angle dependent attenuation of solar radiation to the dust layer. An application of our model to optical yield prediction indicated a significant relative decrease in predicted annual optical efficiency of up to 1.5% for parabolic trough power plants. In future research, a similar method could be adapted to predict optical losses of photovoltaic modules with flat cover glass.

Abstract: The use of solid particles as heat transfer fluid (HTF) presents a great potential to overcome drawbacks addressed in commercial Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. The solid particles thermal energy storage (TES) system allows achieving both high thermal performance at high temperature and low cost from the material perspective. The conversion efficiency of CSP solid particles-based systems at high temperatures strongly depends on the optical properties and thermophysical properties of materials used both as HTF and as storage medium. The present study is aimed to provide more experimental data and evidences of the potential in using particulate solids for CSP application. The solar absorptance and the specific heat capacity of silicon carbide (SiC), silica sand (SiO2), and hematite (Fe2O3) are studied after different aging times at 750 °C and 900 °C. The solar absorptance slightly increases over the aging process except for the silica sand, which decreases its absorptance in the first 100 h, reaching a plateau. After the aging treatment, the specific heat capacity is increased for both SiC and silica sand. However, for the iron oxide the specific heat capacity is lower after aging. The black silicon carbide SiC is proven to be the best option to be used up to 900 °C as it shows the highest solar absorptance (96%) and the highest heat storage capacity.

Abstract: The directional spectral emissivities of four new copper-alloyed spinel coatings for concentrated solar power applications were measured up to 800 °C and compared Pyromark 2500®, deposited in the same conditions on Inconel 625. Reproducible results were found for all coatings at all temperatures, with similar spectral features at working temperatures. The temperature and angular dependences are related to the morphology and composition of the samples. The total hemispherical emissivity increases up to 400 °C for all coatings and then stabilizes, with similar values for most materials, except for the porous Cu0.5Cr1.1Mn1.4O4 coating. This coating offers a reduced total hemispherical emissivity due to increased semitransparency at high angles arising from its porosity. This porosity is linked to an increase in both the solar absorptance and the emissivity in the normal direction due to enhanced light trapping, which means that this coating shows signs of directional selectivity. These results, together with the data dispersion reported for Pyromark, suggest that structural properties are key for the high-temperature emissivity of the coatings and highlight the importance of direct emissivity characterization. Combined with absorptance measurements, these emissivity measurements allow for accurate calculations of the high-temperature efficiencies of the coatings, which reach values up to 0.929.

Abstract: The spatial distribution of device performance parameters of solar cells provides important insight into their operation, including the type and magnitude of conversion losses and potential areas of improvement. In most of the procedures used to create these parameter images, a uniform (i.e., global) short-circuit current density (JSC) is usually assumed. However, JSC is known to vary over the surface of a solar cell, especially in polycrystalline absorber materials like multicrystalline silicon. In this work, a high speed quantum efficiency measurement rastered over the surface of a solar cell is used to obtain images of JSC. These JSC images are then used to calculate images of series resistance, dark saturation current density, fill factor, and conversion efficiency. Comparisons are made between the images created with a global JSC and with the spatially-resolved JSC. Negligible variation is observed in the series resistance and dark saturation current density images, but a drastic change is observed in the efficiency images between these two methods.

Abstract: As potential candidates of solid−liquid phase change materials (PCM) for latent heat storage in the low-to-medium temperature range (80–250 °C), the temperature-dependent rheological behaviors of five select sugar alcohols were characterized over a wide range of shear rates from 10−3 s−1 to 104 s−1. It was found that the four linear-structured sugar alcohols, i.e., xylitol, erythritol, d-mannitol, and d-dulcitol, are Newtonian fluids above their respective critical shear rates, in both the molten and supercooled liquid states, and that they exhibit typical shear thinning behaviors below the critical shear rates. In particular, d-mannitol and d-dulcitol, with relatively higher melting points, behave like Herschel-Bulkley fluids, which experience slight yield under small yield stresses (0.0001–0.0099 Pa s and 0.0078–0.0528 Pa s for d-mannitol and d-dulcitol, respectively). Inositol, the only cyclic-structured sugar alcohol with the highest melting point (497.65 K), also behaves like a Herschel-Bulkley fluid in both the molten and supercooled liquid states. The dynamic viscosity curves of inositol were found to agree with the Cross model, leading to determination on its zero shear and infinite shear viscosities. An Arrhenius-type dynamic viscosity-temperature curve was observed for inositol over the entire temperature range at the highest shear rate of 104 s−1.

Abstract: One of the most promising approaches to produce industrial-compatible Transparent Conducting Materials (TCMs) with excellent characteristics is the fabrication of TCO/metal/TCO multilayers. In this article, we report on the electro-optical properties of a novel high-performing TCO/metal/TCO structure in which the intra-layer is a micro-structured metallic grid instead of a continuous thin film. The grid is obtained by evaporation of Ag through a mask of polystyrene colloidal micro-spheres deposited by the Langmuir-Blodgett method and partially dry-etched in plasma. IZO/Ag grid/IZO structures with different thicknesses and mesh dimensions have been fabricated, exhibiting excellent electrical characteristics (sheet resistance below 10 Ω/□) and particularly high optical transmittance in the near-infrared spectral region as compared to planar (unstructured) TCM multilayers. Numerical simulations were also used to highlight the role of the Ag mesh parameters on the electrical properties.

Abstract: We report an alternative method adopting Near InfraRed (NIR) radiations for annealing CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films. This technique provides fast crystallization of perovskite domains as thermal energy is transferred through radiation (non-contact) as well as conduction (contact) mode. While, in case of conventional annealing method (hot plate), thermal energy is released through conduction (contact) mode only. The champion cell fabricated via NIR radiation annealing method shows power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.33% compared to 10.92% by conventional hot plate thermal annealing. The films are characterized by morphological (SEM), optical (UV-ViS) and structural (XRD) aspects. The improved performance owes to smooth and compact morphology, higher absorption, enhanced crystallinity, lower series resistance, improved charge separation and collection in case of NIR annealed perovskite films. The charge transfer resistance and series resistance of interfaces are manifested by Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It can be stated that method and mode of annealing plays a great role in crystallization of perovskite films, which can be adopted for large area industrial processing techniques for these materials.

Abstract: We present effects of counter anions on electrochromic behavior of asymmetrically substituted viologens, 1-hexyl-1′-nonafluorohexyl viologens (HERFVs). For this purpose, two anions, hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]–) and bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide ([TFSI]–), were employed for both HERFVs and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BMIM]+)-based ionic liquids. The HERFV-containing electrochromic devices (ECDs) exhibited apparent dependence on the counter ions in terms of optical contrast, switching speed, long-term cyclic stability, coloration efficiency, and memory effect. Specifically, the ECDs based on [HERFV][PF6]2 showed a redox response at −1.0 V with a color change from colorless to blue. Meanwhile, the coloration of [HERFV][TFSI]2 appeared at −3.0 V, and a significantly long optical memory effect was observed with unstable cyclic repeatability. We attributed this discrepancy to the nature of counter ions, such as size and electronegativity, which may influence the electron transfer process during redox reactions. These results demonstrated that counter anions can exert a significant impact on the EC behaviors of asymmetrically substituted viologens. The presented approach suggests a potential tool for controlling EC properties of viologen derivatives for applications in transmissive windows and eye wear.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 as a rising star semiconducting material with a bandgap of 1.1 eV has played a role of the absorber in the thin film solar cells. Regular device architectures such as metal grids/buffer/Sb2Se3/metal electrode, or transparent electrode film/buffer/Sb2Se3/metal electrode have been fabricated both experimentally and theoretically and exhibit relatively good photovoltaic performances. Yet the theoretical power-conversion efficiency is not competitive with commercial thin film solar cells. Therefore, we propose an inverted architecture with top illumination through ITO substrate, with allocating the hole transport layer (HTL) on top of Sb2Se3 and stacking electron transport layer beneath the Sb2Se3. Indeed an optimal power conversion efficiency of 24.7% and fill factor of 80.3% have been simulated in the solar devices with the selected NiO as the HTL. The improvement in solar cell performances stems from the satisfying bandgap alignment and improved hole conductivity due to the high acceptor concentration of the chosen material. Further increase of the device performances depend on the high quality Sb2Se3 thin films, i.e., with negligible defects states and the suppression of defects at the Sb2Se3/HTL interfaces.

Abstract: In this work, electrolysis with a Mg anode is presented to purify the molten chloride salt (MgCl2/KCl/NaCl 60/20/20 mol.%) for reducing its corrosivity. Using a Mg anode, the production of toxic gases like Cl2 on an inert anode (e.g., tungsten) can be avoided. Moreover, compared to an inert anode, a lower over-potential is required to remove the corrosive impurity MgOH+ in the molten salt due to the high reactivity of Mg. In order to evaluate the effect of the salt purification, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method developed in our previous work is used to in-situ measure the concentration of the corrosive MgOH+ impurity in the molten salt. The CV measurements indicate that the corrosive impurity is efficiently removed by electrolysis. For decreasing the cathode inactivation due to produced MgO on the surface, a pulsed potential applied on the tungsten cathode during electrolysis shows to be promising. This electrochemical salt purification method has shown to be promising by efficiently controlling the corrosivity of the molten chloride salt. The potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) measurements on a commercial high-temperature alloy (Incoloy 800 H) immersed in the molten salt indicate that the corrosion rate of the alloy is significantly reduced due to the salt purification. It could also lead to a reduction of the cost of the conventional salt purification step, structural container materials, and piping in next generation concentrated solar power (Gen3 CSP) plants.

Abstract: In parallel with soaring efficiency, interest in multi-functional semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) has emerged for special applications such as windows and tandem cells. To demonstrate air-stable as well as efficient ITO-free semitransparent PeSCs, ultra thin Cu and Ni, which are well-known non-precious metals having sufficient electrical conductivity, are investigated as bottom transparent electrode and optimization of devices is systematically carried out. Semitransparent Ni/NiOX based PeSC exhibits the average visible transmittance (AVT) of 22% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.20%. Considering required AVT for the application of power-generating window of ∼25% and recent reports, this result is one of the best performances reported to date.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic analysis of the transport mechanism and surface passivation of tunneling oxide (SiO2)/p-type poly-silicon (poly-Si(p)) junctions applied to p-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells by means of TCAD numerical simulations. We report on the impact of the buried doped region (BDR) in the c-Si wafer on the transport and passivation of SiO2/poly-Si(p) junctions. We show that a BDR is not necessary for carrier selective contacts (CSCs) with a tunnel oxide thinner than 1.2 nm and for surface recombination velocity at SiO2/c-Si interface below 1·103 cm/s. Then, we explore alternative semiconductors to poly-Si for tunnel oxide passivating contacts. We find that 3C–SiC(p) is a promising candidate thanks to its valence band offset with respect to silicon, driving the wafer surface into a condition of strong accumulation. We show that excellent SiO2/3C–SiC(p) junctions are obtained for doping density of the 3C–SiC(p) larger than 5·1019 cm−3 and for SiO2 thinner than <1.2 nm. Finally, with the aim of deriving guidelines for material selection, we present an investigation on the influence of the electron affinity and bandgap of the semiconductor layer forming the passivating contact, demonstrating that conversion efficiency is maximized for built-in voltages between 0.4 and 2.6 eV.

Abstract: The development of various cost-effective multifunctional contrast agent for specific targeting molecular imaging of tumors presents a great challenge. We report here the in vivo targeting imaging of folic acid (FA) gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through cysteamine (Cys) linking for targeted of human nasopharyngeal head and neck cancer by computed tomography (CT). The toxicity of nanoparticles in kidney, heart, spleen, brain and liver was evaluated by H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) assay. We showed that the formed FA-Cys-AuNPs with an Au core size of ˜13 nm are non-cytotoxic in the particle concentration of 3 × 103 μg/ ml. The nude mice were scanned using a 64-slice CT scan with parameters (80 kVp, slice thickness: 0.625 mm, mAs: 200, pitch: 1). CT scan was performed before and after (Three and six hours) I.V (Intra Venous) injection of AuNPs and FA-Cys-AuNPs. The distribution of nanoparticles in the nude mice was evaluated by imaging and coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. The findings clearly illustrated that a small tumor, which is undetectable via computed tomography, is enhanced by X-ray attenuation and becomes visible (4.30-times) by the molecularly targeted AuNPs. It was further demonstrated that active tumor cells targeting (FA-Cys-AuNPs) is more specific and efficient (2.03-times) than passive targeting AuNPs. According to the results, FA-Cys-AuNPs can be employed as a promising contrast agent in CT scan imaging and maybe in radiotherapy that require enhanced radiation dose.

Abstract: This work proposes a detailed method to estimate the amount of power produced by photovoltaic energy harvesting in realistic indoor conditions, not only featuring artificial light sources and low levels of irradiance (0.1–1 mW/cm2) but also oblique directional and diffuse lighting. The method is based on a model of performance of a commercial silicon and an organic solar cells under diffuse and oblique light and on simulations of indoor light in a rectangular room of various dimensions. It is found that the solar cells absorb diffuse light almost as efficiently as if it were direct normal light. Diffuse light accounts for 30% to more than 70% of the total illuminance in the indoor configurations investigated. Indoor, the angle of incidence at the point of maximum illuminance on a wall depends solely on the directivity of the source and is usually comprised within 30o-60°, representing 15%–50% of power loss compared to normal incidence. The organic cell can achieve a power generation of up to 27 μW/cm2 under 600 lux in a 4 m2 room, and at least 7 μW/cm2 under a typical indoor illuminance of 200 lux. The performance of the organic cell is found superior to the commercial silicon cell used in this study (7 μW/cm2 under 600 lux), even if the power conversion efficiency of the silicon cell under one sun (12.7%) is higher than the one of the organic cell (5.4%).

Abstract: The inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein and senses cellular unfolded/misfolded proteins. Upon activation, IRE1α removes a 26-bp nucleotide from the mRNA encoding X-box binding protein (XBP) 1 to generate a spliced active form of this transcription factor (XBP1s). Though IRE1α is implicated in development of cancer, the role and underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that IRE1α regulates colon cancer cell metastasis through regulating the expression of fibronectin-1 (FN1). We found that knockdown of IRE1α inhibited colon cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Knockdown of IRE1α decreased the formation of XBP1s and attenuated the expression of FN1, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Src and FAK and inactivation the downstream effector GTPases including RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42. Addition of exogenous FN1 reversed Src/FAK phosphorylation and cell migration inhibited by IRE1α knockdown. We found that XBP1s bound FN1 promoter and acted as a transcription factor to initiate FN1 expression. Our results suggest that IRE1α modulates metastatic potential of colon cancer cells through regulating the expression of FN1.

Abstract: Manufacturing of flexible electrochromic (EC) devices requires the use of low-temperature films for deposition on electronically conductive foils. With this aim, low-temperature V-oxide films were spin-coated from a dispersion prepared by milling of crystalline V2O5 powder in vanadium(V) tri-n-propoxide oxide/isopropanol sol as dispersant. TEM images showed that the milling procedure enables the introduction of some V2O5 nanocrystallites into the matrix of the V-oxide pigmented film prepared at 150 °C. The electrochromic properties were analyzed using in situ UV–visible absorbance spectroelectrochemistry. The low transmittance values of as-prepared pigmented films revealed the presence of a greater amount of reduced V4+ centers compared to the crystalline sol-gel V2O5 model films. Significant bleaching of pigmented V-oxide films occurred during subsequent 521 cycles in the safe potential range. Three different types of vibrational spectroscopies were applied to examine the powdered V-oxide film, and the results were compared to the band changes for the sol-gel crystalline V2O5 films. For initial films, the modes in the IR reflection-absorption spectra were systematically shifted to higher wavenumbers with regard to the modes in the IR absorbance spectra. Both IR techniques confirmed the reversible shift of the vanadyl V-OA band to lower frequencies and the disappearance of the bridging V-OB-V mode upon intercalation. Raman spectra showed the appearance of two vanadyl stretching modes at 986 and 961 cm−1 that occurred simultaneously with the decrease in the intensity of the bands in the 750–400 cm−1 spectral region. After the deintercalation, the Raman spectra of the low-temperature films showed broad bands that remained after the second bleaching. Finally, a flexible NiO1-x/ormolyte/V-oxide EC device was constructed. The device was composed of two different pigmented films and demonstrated the practical applicability of the low-temperature pigmented films.

Abstract: This research investigated the electrochromic, optical and binding-energy performances of Tantalum Pentoxide (Ta2O5) and Zirconium Dioxide (ZrO2) films as the ion conduction layer for an all-solid-state electrochromic device (ECD). The Ta2O5 film was commonly prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with different oxygen/argon (O2/Ar) ratio, while the ZrO2 film was prepared by a cathodic arc with different deposition pressure because the ZrO2 film deposited with RF magnetron sputtering achieved poor electrochromic efficiency. The results exhibited that the Ta2O5 film deposited with O2/Ar ratio of 0.1 had the maximum colored/bleached variation (ΔT) of 52.9%@550 nm, color efficiency (CE) of 21.1 cm2/C, ionic conducting rate of 3 × 10−7 S/cm, and the lowest resistance of 14.3 kΩ. On the other hand, the ZrO2 film deposited with deposition pressure of 45 mTorr had the maximum ΔT of 55.43%@550 nm, CE of 35 cm2/C, ion conducting rate of 3.44 × 10−6 S/cm, and the lowest resistance of 19.37 kΩ. The colored/bleached variation of ZrO2 film was better than that of the Ta2O5 film, as proved by the location shifting of the binding-energy of Zr3d deposited by cathodic arc being larger than that of the Ta4f deposited by RF sputtering. However, the economic ZrO2 film has the potential to replace the traditional Ta2O5 film for an all-solid-state ECD.

Abstract: Passivating the contacts of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells with a poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer on top of a thin silicon oxide (SiOx) is currently sparking interest for reducing recombination at the interface between the metal electrode and the c-Si substrate. Hole-selective poly-Si/SiOx structures could be particularly relevant to passivate the rear side of mass-produced p-type c-Si solar cells (i.e. PERC solar cells). In this study, we elaborate on the optimization of a hole-selective passivating structure consisting of a boron-doped poly-Si layer on top of a chemically grown thin SiOx. The poly-Si layer is prepared by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition, which enables single-side deposition. However, if not optimized, this deposition technique leads to degradation of the poly-Si layer through a “blistering” phenomenon due to high hydrogen incorporation in the layer. To tackle this, a study of the interplay between process parameters and blistering is undertaken in order to obtain highly passivating and blister-free poly-Si/SiOx structures. By addition of a hydrogenation step, the implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) provided by the structure is further improved, leading to a maximum value of 734 mV demonstrated on symmetrical samples made from large area wafers. We also conduct a Conductive-Atomic Force Microscopy (C-AFM) study with the aim of investigating the pinholes formation in the SiOx interfacial layer that could explain the transport of free charge carriers within the poly-Si/SiOx structure. We show that the current levels detected by C-AFM are affected by an oxide layer that grows at the poly-Si top surface. We also demonstrate that conductive spots detected by C-AFM are not likely to mirror conductive pinholes within the SiOx layer but are rather linked to the poly-Si layer.

Abstract: Soiling, which consists of dust, dirt and particles accumulated on the surface of conventional or concentrator photovoltaic modules, absorbs, scatters, and reflects part of the incoming sunlight. Therefore, it reduces the amount of energy converted by the semiconductor solar cells. This work focuses on the effect of soiling on the spectral performance of multi-junction (MJ) cells, widely used in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) applications. Novel indexes, useful to quantify the spectral impact of soiling are introduced, and their meanings are discussed. The results of a one-year experimental investigation conducted in Spain are presented and are used to discuss how soiling impacts each of the subcells of a MJ cell, as well as the cell current-matching. Results show that soiling affects the current balance among the junctions, i.e. the transmittance losses have found to be around 4% higher in the top than in the middle subcell. The spectral nature of soiling has demonstrated to increase the annual spectral losses of around 2%. Ideal conditions for the mitigation of soiling are also discussed and found to be in blue-rich environments, where the higher light intensity at the shorter wavelengths can limit the impact of soiling on the overall production of the CPV system.

Abstract: The microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs) are very promising in thermal storage due to the shape-stable structure that can prevent the leakage of liquid phase change materials during the solid-liquid phase transformation. However, the relatively low thermal conductivity significantly lowers the heat exchange efficiency. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to improve the stability and thermal conductivity by depositing carbon on the surface of Al@Al2O3 composite via in-situ catalytic methane decomposition. In this method, the Al spheres (20–50 μm) are firstly coated by a thin layer of nano Ni species which can promote the oxidation of the surface layer of Al to Al2O3 during the calcination in air. Thereafter, the carbon is produced on the surface of Al@Al2O3 composite when it is submitted to CH4 flow at relatively high temperature (e.g., 650 °C) due to the catalytic methane decomposition by Ni species, obtaining the Al@Al2O3–C composite. The Al@Al2O3–C composite exhibits high phase transition enthalpy (266 J g−1), high thermal conductivity (8 W (m K)−1), and low degree of supercooling in the exothermic process during cooling. In addition, the nesting of the deposited carbon on the surface of phase change material also contributes to obtain dense shell, owning excellent stability in multiple heating/cooling cycles.

Abstract: In this work we present a new epitaxial lift-off (ELO) approach based on the use of a strained AlAs/InAlAs superlattice (SL) as sacrificial layer for InP related materials. Such an ELO process enables the fabrication and transfer of a thin active III-V heterostructure via its separation from its III-V parent substrate using selective chemical etching. The strategy is of particular interest for large area devices such as solar cells. The process studied here also allows the substrate reuse for a low-cost approach based on III-V-based device fabrication. In order to realize the ELO process on InP substrates, the main difficulty is the lack of lattice-matched materials offering the high chemical etching selectivity needed over both the substrate and the lattice-matched alloys of the active heterostructure. The present study therefore contributes effective strategy for overcoming the latter constraints. The AlAs/InAlAs SL was thus explored as a potential candidate as sacrificial layer for the InP lattice matched materials. The growth conditions of such SLs were investigated to produce low defect SLs compatible with the properties of an optimal sacrificial layer. The under-etching behavior of such SLs in a hydrofluoric acid-based solution was also studied in detail. The results show that advantageous under-etching rates, high enough for a full wafer detachment, combined with a low defect density, can be obtained with novel sacrificial layers based on such thin AlAs/InAlAs SL. Finally, the fabrication of solar cells via an active heterostructure grown over an optimized SL on a monolithic substrate and via a thin reported active heterostructure was performed. The solar cells perform well and demonstrate the suitability of such SLs as a sacrificial layer for InP related materials.

Abstract: Brownmillerite KBiFe2O5 (KBFO) absorbs large part of the solar spectrum due to its smaller bandgap. This optical response has immense potential in photocatalytic applications. In this work, KBFO was successfully synthesized using citrate combustion method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as Mössbauer spectroscopic studies, identify the valence state of Iron (Fe) as Fe3+. The strong magneto-dielectric coupling in KBFO was demonstrated by integrating both magnetization (M) and dielectric constant (ε) characteristics as a function of temperature. Magnetic and dielectric transitions were observed in close proximity in temperature range ∼780 K–760 K respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the photoelectrochemical properties of as developed KBFO were analyzed for the first time revealing a significant photoresponse with an average photocurrent density of 0.1  μA cm−2. The photocatalytic properties of KBFO were investigated by degrading organic effluent methylene blue (MB) under direct sunlight followed by a comparison with the photodegradation performance of perovskite BiFeO3 (BFO). KBFO showed enhanced photocatalytic performance as compared to BFO due to its enhanced structural and optical properties.

Abstract: Dislocation clusters and sub-grain boundaries (Sub-GBs) induced by the misorientation between adjacent seeds are destructive to the quasi-single crystal (QSC) Si ingot quality and the solar cell efficiency. Here, we have designed an artificial Σ13 GB between two adjacent <100>-oriented seeds at the crucible bottom. It is found that the generation of dislocation clusters and sub-GBs from the seed junctions is significantly suppressed owing to the low energy barrier potential of the Σ13 GB. Although some twins could generate from the vertical Σ13 GB, they will not give a bad influence on the ingot quality. The efficiency of solar cells is absolutely high in industrial circles, with an average value of 20.1%. These results pave a new way to the fabrication of high quality QSC-Si ingots for photovoltaic application.

Abstract: Thermal conductivity is a crucial factor for selecting appropriate phase change material (PCM) for use in the field of thermal storage. In the current work, sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) was combined with xanthan gum and copper foam to prepare a composite PCM using a vacuum impregnation method, with the main purpose of increasing its thermal conductivity. The latent heat of SAT/xanthan gum (SAT/X) containing 98 wt% SAT and 2 wt% xanthan gum was measured to be 255.5 J/g, close to the theoretical value according to the content of SAT in the composite SAT/X. The saturated mass fraction of SAT/X in SAT/xanthan gum/copper foam (SAT/X/CF) was calculated to be equal to 77.2%, therefore the SAT/X/CF can have an estimated latent heat of 197.2 J/g. The thermal conductivity of final composite PCM was 2.10 W/(m·K), 1.76 times higher than that of SAT/X, suggesting that copper foam performs well in the area of thermal conductivity enhancement. A heating/cooling cycle was carried out 200 times to examine the cycling stability of SAT/X and SAT/X/CF. The experimental analysis illustrated that the latent heat of SAT/X decreased by only 5.9%, as compared with that of the prepared one. Improved thermal conductivity, high heat storage capacity together with great thermal cycling stability make SAT/X/CF a very promising material in solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: This work focuses on reducing the hysteresis and improving the stability of TiO2-based perovskite solar cells. A simple slow hydrolysis and rapid evaporation (SHRE) method was developed to deposit amorphous nanoporous WOx up on the TiO2 base at low temperature to form a TiO2-WOx bilayer as composite electron transport materials (ETMs) for efficient CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells. In the composite bilayers, the nanoporous WOx sublayer functions as an effective scaffold to modify the electrical contact between the perovskite and TiO2, and also as an anti-reflective film to enhance light transmittance. The WOx modifying layer much reduces the serious hysteresis and the dependence of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) on the J–V scan rates. Moreover, it has also significantly enhanced the long-term stability of solar cells. The functioning mechanism for the WOx modifying layer in the TiO2-WOx composite ETMs is explored and interpreted in terms of nanoporous inorganic scaffolds and also the salutary effect of capacitive currents from the high-capacitance WOx.

Abstract: The semiconducting and non-toxic enzymatic polygallic acid (PGAL) produces water dispersible poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-PGAL) and polyaniline (PANI-PGAL). The results indicate that PGAL is a template for the model polymers, and thereby, the complexes are processable by spray coating to produce flexible electrochromic devices (ECDs). The materials were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and conductivity measurements in pellet form. Additionally, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic techniques in combination with UV-spectroscopy assess these materials. The produced ECDs based on PEDOT-PGAL has a ΔT of up to 19% and a life span lower than 100 cycles. However, when the PEDOT-PGAL architecture is complementary with PANI-PGAL displays up to 1000 times with a ΔT of 15% and coloring efficiencies of 275 cm2/C. The color of this PGAL-based device changes from dark violet to light green which differs from the common complementary EDCs. Additionally, complementary ECD fabricated with PEDOT-PSS against PANI-PGAL enhances the coloring efficiency up to 517 cm2/C (ΔT = 26%) and cycled 1000 times.

Abstract: Soiling is a severe problem for solar energy production. For the development and evaluation of new mitigation strategies such as innovative coatings for PV modules, reliable and realistic test methods are needed. An advanced laboratory soiling test setup and sequential test procedures were used to evaluate the anti-soiling performance of glass coatings. The test method comprises the process of dust deposition by sedimentation in a dust chamber at controlled environmental conditions and two approaches to simulate natural self-cleaning processes by wind, i.e. wind blow testing and rotational force tests (RFT). In order to evaluate the effects of particle rebound during dust deposition and the two different particle removal mechanisms in detail, a physical model including relevant particle adhesion and removal forces is presented. The theoretical analysis shows that the physical processes involved are significantly influenced by particle sizes. Accordingly, soiling test results for uncoated solar glass, an Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) and an Anti-Soiling Coating (ASC) were analyzed with respect to individual particle sizes and interpreted with the help of the theoretical models. In addition, a statistical approach is presented for determination of coating specific particle adhesion forces from rotational force tests. The newly developed test methods may be used as a practical approach for coating evaluation and future coating development, whereby the presented models and evaluation results for industry-relevant coatings enable a better understanding of particle detachment mechanisms relevant for soiling.

Abstract: Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA) expression is reduced or absent in several types of cancer and cancer cell lines; however, their expression and regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) increase SERCA3 mRNA expression in gastric and breast cancer cell lines by increasing H3K9ac and binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the promoter; however, the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Our results show that ATP2A3 (SERCA3) gene expression is decreased in human HCC samples and rat HCC AS-30D cells compared to normal liver, and HCC patients with high expression of ATP2A3 had longer overall survival than those with low expression. Sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA) increase SERCA3 mRNA expression in AS-30D cells, whereas SERCA2b mRNA expression did not change. NaB and TSA increase H3K9ac and H3K27ac in two ATP2A3 promoter regions. Besides, NaB treated cells increased Sp1 and Sp3 occupancy at ATP2A3 promoter; whereas TSA treated cells showed increased p300 levels at ATP2A3 promoter. Inhibition of p300 by C646, a specific inhibitor, mitigates SERCA3 mRNA induction by TSA, and reduces more than 70% of basal SERCA3 mRNA expression, suggesting that p300 is important for ATP2A3 gene transcription in AS-30D cells. Moreover, inhibition of p300 decreases H3K9ac in TSA treated cells. Our results provide evidence of decreased SERCA3 expression in human HCC samples and rat AS-30D cells and a correlation of SERCA3 expression with overall survival in HCC patients. Also, reveal new insights in SERCA3 transcriptional regulation mediated by HDACi.

Abstract: Loss of E-cadherin expression is a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor progression. Because previous findings suggested that homeobox C8 (HOXC8) promotes EMT in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we investigated whether E-cadherin is a target of HOXC8 protein. In this study, we report that HOXC8 binds to the E-cadherin promoter and acts as a transcriptional repressor to regulate E-cadherin transcription in NSCLC. We further show that loss of E-cadherin leads to an increase in anchorage-independent growth and migration of NSCLC cells, and the inhibitory effects mediated by HOXC8 knockdown can be largely rescued by reduction of E-cadherin expression, suggesting that the HOXC8-E-cadherin pathway is involved in lung cancer progression. Moreover, analysis of E-cadherin and HOXC8 expression indicates that expression of HOXC8 is strongly correlated with loss of E-cadherin expression, and high HOXC8 / low E-cadherin expression is significantly correlated with poor survival for lung cancer patients. Taken together, these data indicate that E-cadherin is a target gene of HOXC8 and that the loss of E-cadherin promotes the growth and migration of NSCLC.

Abstract: The silica/polyaniline (SiO2/PANI) nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization. The SiO2/PANI nanocomposite film shows improved electrochromic properties, compared with dense PANI film. The all-solid-state electrochromic device based on SiO2/PANI nanocomposite film (ECD-SiPN) is fabricated by assembling SiO2/PANI and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) films as the anode and cathode, respectively. Large optical modulation (62% at 700 nm), short switching time (5.7 s for bleaching, 3.2 s for coloring), high coloration efficiency (135.1 cm2/C), and good cycling stability are realized by the ECD-SiPN. And the spray-processable, large-area and all-solid-state electrochromic device also maintain good electrochromic performance. Furthermore, the high-quality patterned all-solid-state electrochromic display was successfully prepared by assembling spray-deposited patterned silica/polyaniline (SiO2/PANI) nanocomposite film as electrochromic active layer and spray-coated patterned PEDOT:PSS film layer as counter electrode. The patterned electrochromic display exhibits promising features for applications in electronic books, large area electronic cards, large area electronic advertising boards, energy efficient displays etc.

Abstract: A simple yet reproducible method to deposit high quality aluminium oxide (AlOx) film by spray coating is presented. Excellent thickness and refractive index uniformity is demonstrated. The AlOx film was found to be nearly stoichiometric with an oxygen to aluminium ratio of 1.7 from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. An interfacial layer with thickness of about 2 nm was observed in transmission electron microscopy analysis. The interfacial layer was determined to be aluminium silicate from XPS data. Electrical characterization of the films on Czochralski (Cz) p-type silicon yielded dielectric constant of 6.5 and mean breakdown field of 4.7 MV cm−1. Interface state density of 8.7×1010 eV−1cm−2 and fixed charge density of −5.5×1012 cm−2 were obtained from the electrical characterization of metal insulator semiconductor capacitors. The excellent interface quality with low interface state density and high negative charge is suitable for passivation of p-type silicon in solar cell applications. Effective surface recombination velocity of 12 cm s−1 and 48 cm s−1 were obtained for Cz p-type silicon surface for annealing temperature of 750°C and 790°C respectively without the use of capping layer.

Abstract: Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) shows great promise in thin film photovoltaic application due to its reasonable band gap, low cost and non-toxic earth-abundant composition. Post-selenization is the generally adopted approach to obtain CZTSSe film with large-grain size. Thoroughly understanding and well controlling the grain growth process during selenization is thus essential for achieving high-performance solar cell devices. Here we demonstrate that the absorber microstructure can be adjusted by altering selenization conditions, especially the heating rate and annealing time. It is found that heating rate determines formation manner of top CZTSSe layer, while annealing time affects both the crystallization degree of bottom CZTSSe layer and the selenization of Mo contact layer. Properly adjusting the annealing time at an optimized heating rate is proven to successfully eliminate the fine-grain layer and obtain high quality CZTSSe thin films with large-size grains. Based on the observations, growth mechanisms for the microstructure development during selenization of solution processed Cu2ZnSnS4 films are suggested. Finally, CZTSSe device efficiency of 9.24% is achieved at an optimal selenization condition.

Photo-thermochromic properties of oxygen-containing yttrium hydride and tungsten oxide composite films,

Abstract: Monolayer oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHx:O) and tungsten oxide (WO3) films show photochromic properties and have many potential energy-saving applications. YHx:O/WO3 composite films have better solar energy regulation properties than their monolayers because of the photochromic synergistic effects between the YHx:O and WO3 thin films. However, the reversion of these films to their initial transparent state is slow at room temperature, which limits their use in energy-saving windows. In this work, we developed a photo-thermochromic optical switching method that reversibly changes YHx:O/WO3 films between their transparent and infrared (IR) absorption states smoothly. The YHx:O/WO3 composite films were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering, and the reversible optical switching properties and photochromic mechanism were investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The composite films changed from their transparent state to their absorption state under illumination within 10 min, and returned to their transparent state when they were heated at 60–100 °C for 5 min. Compared with the single-layer YHx:O film, the YHx:O/WO3 composite films had a high color change rate and high solar transmittance (ΔTsol = 50.46%). We speculate that the mobile H in the YHx:O layer diffuses to the WO3 layer after illumination, converting WO3 to a tungsten bronze structure, increasing the IR absorption of the composite films. The diffusion of H in the YHx:O and WO3 layers was reversible and had good switching repeatability, and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that H moved reversibly in films and played an important role in the photochromic process.

Abstract: This paper assesses the mechanical stability and dehydration behaviour of a new composite material constituted by magnesium sulphate hepta-hydrate, used as filler at vary contents, and a porous silicone, used as matrix in order to evaluate its applicability in sorption thermal energy storage field. This new composite was developed to avoid the typical issues of salt hydrates such as swelling, agglomeration and corrosion issues occurring during hydration/dehydration process. A preliminary physical-mechanical characterization, by means of morphological and calorimetric analysis, was carried out to investigate the main properties of the composite foams. The morphological characterization showed that the foam pores were homogenously distributed and well interconnected to each other. Thermo-gravimetric dehydration tests, have demonstrated that the tested samples are able to exchange efficiently water. Static compression tests evidenced a high compression stability of the material, indicating a high flexibility of the cellular silicone structure. Furthermore, cyclic compression test was performed to evaluate the progressive loss of salt at increasing number of the cycles. After 50 cycles, a reduction of salt hydrate up to 13% was observed. This behaviour, that is potentially a critical factor in these composite structures, was studied for showing that the loss of the salt does not compromise considerably the sorption storage performance of the filled silicone foams. Eventually, the assessment of thermo-gravimetric characteristics and mechanical stability was performed on the MgSO4·7H2O silicone composite foam.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxides (VO2) thermochromic materials could exhibit reversible change in optical transmittance in response to external temperature. However, traditional VO2-based smart window is limited to an insufficient solar modulation ability as well as excessive transition temperature. Herein, we designed an all-solid form of YOxHy/VO2 multilayer film structure on quartz glass substrate, which can separately regulate visible and NIR light transmittance responding to environmental light and temperature, respectively. The hybrid film exhibits transparency under normal condition of room temperature and weak illumination, and solar energy transmittance can be dynamically regulated from 43% to 28%, 16% and finally 14% by controlling the conditions of temperature and illumination. Also, the optical and electrical transition temperature of m-VO2 shows an obvious decline. This hybrid film features high solar modulation ability and great conditional responsiveness with zero-energy consumption and low transition temperature. Our current results would supply new opportunities for smart-window applications, and also provide a new strategy for solar transmittance modulation.

Abstract: Recently, the idea of radiative cooling by dissipating infrared thermal energy to the cold space through the atmospheric window, especially from 8 to 13 μm in wavelength, has become an attractive way to cool down outdoor devices. Here we show that thin silica (SiO2) micro-gratings as solar-transparent and radiatively cooling coatings for silicon solar cells. The well-designed silica micro-gratings were fabricated with plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, photolithography, and reactive ion etching processes. Spectrometric measurements showed that the SiO2 micro-gratings atop doped silicon wafer could remarkably enhance the infrared emittance up to 100% within the atmospheric window and increase the solar absorptance with anti-reflection. Numerical modeling confirmed the measured optical and radiative properties and elucidated the underlying physical mechanisms for the anti-reflection in the solar spectrum and enhanced infrared thermal emission. The radiative cooling performance calculated based on a heat transfer model signified that by enhancing the radiative heat dissipation to the space, the grating structure could increase the radiative cooling power when the structure temperature is higher than 45 °C, and reduce the stagnation temperature by up to 20 °C depending on convective heat transfer coefficients. Furthermore, an outdoor field test has been conducted to experimentally demonstrate the cooling performance of the silica micro-gratings, where the grating covered sample showed a lower temperature than the bare silicon sample did under direct sunlight.

Abstract: Many solution based methods of fabricating thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell absorbers can be described as a two step process, consisting of initial precursor deposition followed by high temperature post processing. This post processing step is termed “selenization” when the sample is treated in a selenium-rich environment, and is responsible for transforming the nanocrystalline or amorphous precursor layer into the large crystal grains that are necessary for high efficiency solar cells. Here we study the selenization of nanoparticle Cu(In,Ga)S2 precursor layers by a rapid thermal processing method, and develop a liquid assisted growth model to explain how large grain Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 crystals nucleate and grow. We find that processing with saturated selenium, achieved by maintaining a higher temperature for the selenium source than the sample, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for grain growth of a 1–2 μm thick Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 film. An additional necessary condition is an external supply of Na, without which grain growth of films on soda-lime glass stagnates at about 400 nm thickness, with the remainder of the film consisting of a bottom layer of fine grains. This stagnation of grain growth is hypothesized to be caused by diffusion limitations of Cu, In and Ga containing species from the coarsened selenized particles in the fine grain layer as well as accumulation of carbon left behind by the solution processing method which is rejected during grain growth. We find that deposition of a NaF layer on the nanoparticle precursor film followed by selenization at temperatures greater than 534 °C under a saturated selenium atmosphere results in large surface grains that span the thickness of the film, with only a thin bottom small grain layer primarily composed of carbon and selenium. Grain growth prior to stagnation is well described by a normal grain growth model, and our kinetic study yielded an estimated rate constant activation energy of 126.1 kJ/mol. Attempting to grow grains beyond the stagnation point results in abnormal grain growth. We develop a liquid assisted grain growth model to explain these observations.

Abstract: Rhodium (Rh) oxide thin films were prepared by reactive sputtering at different substrate temperatures under an oxygen or water (H2O) vapor atmosphere, and their crystal structure, density, optical properties, and electrochromic properties were investigated. The film density decreased with decreasing substrate temperature, and the lowest density of 4.2 g/cm3 was obtained for the film deposited at −20 °C under a H2O vapor atmosphere. The Rh oxide films deposited at −20 °C under a H2O vapor atmosphere showed anodic electrochromism between light yellow and olive i.e., bleached and colored states, respectively using an aqueous 1 M potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte; these films also exhibited the largest transmittance change, of 26%, at a wavelength of 600 nm.

Abstract: Formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3), as one promising Pb-free halide perovskite, has received extensive attention. But perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on FASnI3 films have yet to realize the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved in its Pb-based counterparts. To investigate the limitation of FASnI3-based perovskite solar cells with inverted p-i-n planar structures, the influences of various parameters on the device performance are analyzed through device simulation. The results reveal that defect density at front hole transport material (HTM)/absorber interface is critical for high efficiency. And it is interesting to note that the doping density, rather than the doping type and its space distribution, dominates the device properties, and an upper limit of 1 × 1016 cm−3 is achieved. In addition, the response of device to band offset is investigated, and an optimum electron affinity of 3.9 eV is obtained. Finally, the effects of relative permittivity and thickness of the absorber with different carrier lifetime are studied. A maximum PCE of 9.75% is achieved at absorber thickness of 300 nm with carrier lifetime of 0.1 ns? These results show that optimizing the interface property and band offset, improving the stability of Sn2+ and reducing the defect density of absorber layer are the main challenges for high-performance FASnI3-based PSCs in the future research.

Abstract: Improving solar energy modulation ability while maintaining high visible-light transmittance has been a challenge of VO2 application in smart window. The improvement of solar modulation ability will often be accompanied by the decrease of visible light transmittance. In the present work, we propose a solution to improve the solar energy modulation ability and maintain high visible-light transmittance through etching the sputtered VO2 thin film by dilute sulfuric acid, which is based on the strong resonance coupling effect. We prepared planar VO2 thin film and acid-treated film with the similar transmittance. Their transmittances (Tlum) are about 57%. However, the solar energy modulation rate (ΔTsol) of acid-treated VO2 particles is increased by 277.8% compared with planar VO2 film. FDTD method is used to calculate the optical properties of acid-treated and planar VO2 film, the simulation results are consistent with experimental results. The increment of ΔTsol is related to the surface plasmon resonance and its coupled electromagnetic field of metallic state VO2. These results demonstrate that surface plasmon resonance and its coupling effect can be used to further enhance the solar energy modulation while maintaining the visible light transmittance. We hope these results will contribute to the area of smart window and other fields.

Abstract: Conjugated polymers have been extensively used for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, thin-film transistors and electrochromics. Over the past decade, a large number of donor-acceptor type conjugated polymers with an alternating array of electron donors and acceptors have been designed and synthesised for organic electrochromics application. The selection of proper electron donors and in particular electron acceptors to construct desired conjugated polymers allows scientists to precisely tailor optical and electronic properties of resulting conjugated polymers. In this review, electrochromic conjugated polymers will be summarised based on a category of widely-used electron acceptors including benzothiadiazole, benzoselenadiazole, benzooxazole, benzotriazole, benzoimidazole, quinoxalines and diketopyrrolopyrroles. This paper would help scientists understand how structurally different electron acceptors to control and modulate the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital by sophisticatedly synthesizing appropriate electron acceptors, thus creating a broad colour palette, and eventually delivering a variety of desired electrochromic parameters such as switching speed, optical contrast, colouration efficiency as well as long-term stability. This summary account will give an insight into design principle and structure-properties relationship of electrochromic conjugated polymers for interested researchers to find optimal performance electrochromic polymeric materials.

Furthermore, WWP1 (WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) inhibits NF-κB activation that is strongly correlated with gliomagenesis. Using the GEO database and bioinformatics analyses, we identified WWP1 was downregulated in glioma tissues and might be a putative target for miR-30a-5p. Hence, this study aims to explore the interaction among miR-30a-5p, WWP1, and NF-κB and their roles in the regulation of glioma development. We found decreased WWP and increased miR-30a-5p expression and p65 phosphorylation in glioma tissues. Furthermore, WWP1 mRNA level was negatively correlated with miR-30a-5p expression in glioma tissues. Interestingly, miR-30a-5p targeted WWP1 expression. Additionally, NF-κB p65 overexpression increased miR-30a-5p expression through direct binding of NF-κB RelA subunit to the promoter of miR-30a-5p. We also confirmed that WWP1 overexpression decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Importantly, miR-30a-5p promoted glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via targeting WWP1. Furthermore, NF-κB p65 overexpression inhibited WWP1 expression and promoted glioma cell malignant behaviors via inducing miR-30a-5p transcription. Moreover, WWP1 overexpression decreased miR-30a-5p expression and inhibited glioma cell malignant behaviors via inhibiting NF-κB p65. Our further assay showed that WWP1 inhibited in vivo growth of xenograft tumors of glioma cells, accompanied with a decrease in miR-30-5p expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. In conclusion, there is a “miR-30a-5p-WWP1-NF-κB” positive feedback loop, which plays an important role in regulating glioma development and might provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioma.

Abstract: We present a versatile, cost-effective formulation platform for highly conductive silver pastes used in front-side metallization of silicon (Si) solar cells. Pastes based on the capillary suspension concept include silver particles, glass frit and two immiscible fluids. Capillary forces inferred from the second fluid added only in small fractions induce the formation of a percolating particle network. This provides extended shelf-life and distinct flow properties adjustable in a wide range as demanded by the respective printing process, thus yielding residual-free sintered electrodes. Si-wafers are successfully metallized with such pastes using conventional screen-printing, knotless screen and Pattern Transfer Printing™. Paste spreading is studied via high-speed imaging during screen-printing on glass plates. Morphology of printed lines is analyzed using laser scanning microscopy. Electrical properties of the cells are characterized employing a solar simulator and electroluminescence spectroscopy. Results are compared to those obtained using commercial pastes including the same silver particles and glass frits. Paste performance strongly depends on the selected secondary fluid. Aspect ratios ≈0.4–0.5 can be reached and cell efficiencies ηeff ≈ 21% on Cz- and 18.6% on mc Si-wafers are obtained. Additional investigations are necessary to further reduce paste spreading and line interruptions thus improving cell performance.

Abstract: In this work, a mixture of polyethylene and ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer is used as a base polymer to prepare the paraffin/expanded graphite composite by extrusion technology. The as-prepared phase change material has tensile strength of 8.1 MPa, bending strength of 14.7 MPa, thermal conductivity of 2.08 W m-1 K-1 and melting enthalpy of 139 J g-1. We found that the polyethylene has an advantage of increasing the compactness of phase change material and the ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer could improve the compatibility of phase change material. The polyethylene and ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer could confine the phase change materials in the narrow space to improve the mechanical property, and the optimized ratio of polyethylene and ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer could improve the dispersity of expanded graphite to increase thermal conductivity. The optimized phase change material shows great photo-thermal performance with storage capacity of 1700J in 270s, which takes 8.3% of time than pure paraffin. This work provides a strategy to prepare a robust phase change material with good mechanical and thermal properties and photo-thermal performance.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is an ideal thermochromic material for “smart window” which can reduce energy consumption of air conditioning in modern architectures. However, the application of VO2-based smart window is always limited by the poor luminous transmittance (Tlum), low solar regulation efficiency (ΔTsol) and unsightly brown color. According to previous researches, compositing has been approved to be an effective method to solve all of above issues for VO2-based smart window simultaneously. In this work, a new thermochromic ionic liquid (nickel-bromine-ionic liquid (or Ni-Br-IL, for short)) was synthesized and introduced to be composited with VO2 nanoparticles for enhanced performance. The composite film demonstrates ultrahigh optical properties: ΔTsol = 27.0%, which is 1.91 times higher than that of pure VO2 film (14.1%) at a rather high Tlum (Tl,lum = 65.9% and Th,lum = 55.3%) with little loss of visible light at high temperature (ΔTlum = 10.6%). Meanwhile, it can be observed the color change from light yellow to green clearly as the temperature rises. Such enhanced performance will benefit the publicity and application for VO2-based smart window.

Abstract: Lead halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for solar energy conversion because of their electronic and optical properties. Using first principles we obtain these properties for the chlorine, bromine and iodine lead halide perovskites. In order to analyze the contributions of the different atoms and orbitals to the absorption coefficient, we split them into a many-species expansion. It allows the atomic and orbital contributions to be identified and quantified as a photon energy function.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a facile and feasible strategy to prepare natural tubular clay halloysites nanotubes (HNT)@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanocomposites as an electrochromic material. The HNT@PEDOT nanocomposites were formed by coating PEDOT on the outer surface of HNT through in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization. Due to the hollow tubular and hierarchical porous structure of the hybrid nanocomposites, the surface area of active materials is enlarged and the diffusion distance of ions is shortened. Consequently, the HNT@PEDOT film delivers higher optical contrast (59.3%), coloration efficiency value (174.3 cm2/C) and long-cycle stability compared to pure PEDOT film. Besides, the as-prepared solution processable electrochromic material enables the utilization of printing or spraying methods and applies for large area and patterned films.

Abstract: We demonstrate single junction GaInNAsSb solar cells with high nitrogen content, i.e. in the range of 5–8%, and bandgap energies close to 0.7 eV grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A good crystalline quality is demonstrated for the entire range of N concentrations. An average external quantum efficiency of 0.45 is demonstrated for GaInNAsSb solar cell with 6.2% N exhibiting a bandgap of 0.78 eV (no antireflection coatings has been applied). The internal quantum efficiency for the cell is 0.65 at Eg + 0.2 eV. The solar cells exhibited bandgap-voltage offsets between 0.55 V (for N = 5.3%) and 0.66 V (for N = 7.9%). When used in a six-junction solar cell architecture under AM1.5D illumination, the estimated short-circuit current density corresponding to the 0.78 eV cell is 8.2 mA/cm2. Furthermore, using the parameters obtained for the GaInNAsSb junction with 6.2% N, we have estimated that such six-junction solar cell architecture could realistically attain an efficiency of over 50% at 1000 suns concentration.

Abstract: Aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) has been considered as a prospective material for application as transparent electrodes in solar cells. In this application, an improvement of the Hall mobility is desired to achieve the high conductivity, because an increase in the carrier concentration results in a decrease in transmission at near-infrared wavelengths. However, the achievement of high Hall mobility is still a challenge. Another challenge associated with AZO is the low thermal stability of the electrical properties, which limits the application of AZO. This limitation originates from Zn desorption and migration of oxygen from the environment into the AZO film. It has been shown that using an ultrathin Al capping layer on an AZO film can greatly improve its thermal stability. An improvement in the Hall mobility was obtained for an Al capped AZO film after annealing in N2 gas at 400 °C. The Hall mobility reached 49.1 cm2/V, which is close to the theoretical limit of the mobility for an AZO polycrystalline film, with a moderate carrier concentration of 2.8 × 1020 cm−3, ensuring high transparency in the visible and near-infrared ranges. The obtained results are due to the passivation effect of the AlOx film formed by natural oxidation of Al film. Zn desorption was suppressed and the migration of O from the environment was reduced, leading to an improvement in the thermal stability. Once Zn desorption is prevented, improvement of the crystalline perfection due to thermal annealing can contribute to an improvement in the Hall mobility.

Abstract: The preparation of VO2-based polymer coatings with simultaneously high visible transmittance and high solar modulation ability has been elusive for smart window design. In this work, reflux synthesis was examined with ammonium metavanadate as a non-toxic precursor, being reduced by aspartic acid in a water-based approach for the synthesis of monoclinic vanadium dioxide [VO2(M)]. The optimum synthesis conditions were determined for an oxidation stable, W-doped, monoclinic vanadium oxide showing a low transition temperature (Tc) between its monocline and tetragonal phases with small hysteresis. Systematically the molar ratio of ammonium metavanadate and aspartic acid, the annealing temperature and time on the VO2(M) crystal structure were varied. The results showed that an aspartic acid/NH4VO3 molar ratio of 0.6/1, calcined at 800 °C for 2 h delivered VO2(M) in high yields without containing V2O5. Optimized VO2(M) was then doped with tungsten with nominal concentrations up to 4 at.%. Again annealing conditions were optimized. The lowest Tc of 53.6 °C was found for the 3 at.% W-nominal doping concentration with an 800 °C annealing for 2 h. This material was shown stable against oxidation and exhibited a visible transparency (Tlum) of 68.3% at 22 °C and a solar modulation efficiency (ΔTsol) of 20.4% between 22 °C and 80 °C in a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coating. In addition, a pure VO2(M) phase was achieved at lower annealing temperatures and shorter times with the addition of W or PVP, which was not possible for the un-doped or pristine sample.

Abstract: Solar absorbing coating is a critical component in concentrated solar power (CSP) system. How to further decrease costs and enhance thermal stability of coatings is crucial for large-scaled CSP systems. Herein, we present a cost-effective and facile strategy to prepare the MoSi2–SiO2 based coatings, which can survive at 850 °C in air for 100 h due to the formation of a SiO2 barrier in cermet that prevents the coatings from further oxidation. The absorbers demonstrate a high absorptance of ∼95%, and the total efficiency using this absorber could reach 63.5% with the conditions of a solar concentration ratio of C = 1000 at 850 °C, which exceeds most of spectrally selective coatings. These results suggest that the MoSi2–SiO2 based absorbing coating would be a potential candidate for a large-scale deployment in high-temperature solar thermal conversion systems.

Abstract: Hydrogen is a highly relevant impurity in crystalline silicon associated with a variety of effects particularly important in solar cell technology such as defect and surface passivation. It has been the subject of countless studies. Much of this however relies to a certain degree on speculation due to limitations in hydrogen measurement capability, making a direct quantitative correlation of these phenomena with the hydrogen content largely impossible so far. In this contribution, we apply recent advances in the understanding of hydrogen introduction and behaviour in silicon - in particular the conversion of quenched in dimeric hydrogen to boron hydrogen pairs (BH) - and introduce an easy-to-apply methodology to determine quantitatively the hydrogen concentration in bulk boron-doped silicon. The technique involves the measurement and analysis of changes to the bulk resistivity, as recorded by contactless eddy-current measurements, due to the formation of BH pairs during annealing at temperatures between 140 and 180 °C. To demonstrate the method, we apply it to boron-doped float-zone silicon wafers with SiNx:H coatings of different compositions, introducing different total hydrogen concentrations between 5 × 1014 and 1.3 × 1015 cm−3 into the silicon bulk during a fast-firing step. Without firing, the hydrogen content is below the detection limit of 3 × 1014 cm−3 for the 1 Ω cm test sample used.

Abstract: We present a module fabrication process enabling gap-free interconnection of c-Si solar cells using solder-based interconnection technology with ribbons or wires. The interconnect-shingling process increases the module efficiency by avoiding the gaps between the solar cells. The process is applicable to bifacial cells and uses well-proven interconnection technologies. In contrast to previous adhesive-based shingled modules, the current transport is supported by interconnects, thus reducing the silver consumption for the cells’ metallization and avoiding cell overlap. We lay down the cells on structured encapsulant layers to reduce mechanical stress at the cell edges during lamination. Alternatively, the lamination process can be adapted to allow the encapsulant to reflow. This also results in a low pressure at sensitive cell parts. Both approaches avoid crack formation. We demonstrate the interconnect-shingling process with a proof-of-concept module having a aperture area efficiency of 22.1%. Applying 200 thermal cycles does not cause any crack formation.

Abstract: We report an industrial compatible tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) structure on solar-grade p-type c-Si wafer as the rear emitter for high-efficiency solar cells, where the ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) is made by plasma-assisted oxidation and the P-doped n-type poly-Si (n+-poly-Si) contact layer by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with in-situ doping with PH3 and following the high-temperature annealing. The fabrication processes of SiOx and n+-poly-Si layers are systematically optimized. It is found that the optimized annealing temperature for the crystallization and dopant activation is in the range of 850 °C and 880 °C, which is higher than the similar structure with chemically oxidized SiOx (820 °C). In addition, the samples made with higher PH3/SiH4 doping ratio during the a-Si:H deposition need a lower annealing temperature to reach the similar dopant distribution within the samples made with lower doping ratio but annealed at higher temperature, it means that the optimized annealing temperature decreases with the increase of the PH3/SiH4 doping ratio during the deposition of a-Si:H precursor. The optimized process with post-hydrogenation yields excellent surface passivation on the p-type Si substrate with the implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of ∼742 mV, the single-side saturated recombination current density (J0) of ∼3.0 fA/cm2, the contact resistivity (ρc) of ∼2–4 mΩ cm2, and the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) of ∼1050 μs (Δn = 1 × 1015 cm-3). With these passivation parameters, a simulation study demonstrates the advantage of rear emitter over the conventional front emitter TOPCon solar cell with ∼22.8% achievable efficiency on solar-grade p-type wafers with current industrial constraints, and ∼24.9% on high quality p-type c-Si wafers with the optimized conditions in R&D laboratories. Our study suggests that the p-type c-Si solar cell with a rear n+-poly-Si TOPCon emitter is a viable structure for high-efficiency solar cell production.

This paper reports on a novel multicolor ECD with a simple hybrid capacitor architecture (glass/ITO/multi-EC gel/carbon/glass), containing both anodic and cathodic EC materials. By employing the carbon capacitor electrode having porous morphology and large surface area as a counter electrode, even large charge amount consumed by multiple redox pairs’ cathodic materials was adequately compensated. The successful fabrication of the device, consequently, it provides four well-defined colors (white, green, yellow, and red) in one single device.

Abstract: miR-182 was revealed to be upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and contributed to CRC development. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of miR-182 in the progression of CRC remains largely elusive. Herein, miR-182 was upregulated in CRC serum samples, CRC tissues and cells. miR-182 expression was evidently reduced in postoperative serum samples, compared with preoperative serum samples, whereas miR-182 expression was re-elevated in serum samples from CRC patients who developed postoperative recurrence. Exogenous miR-182 promoted the proliferation, colony formation, increased ki67 level and facilitated the invasion capability of CRC cells by enhancing the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9, while inhibition of miR-182 showed the opposite effects. Additionally, miR-182 was demonstrated to target DAB2IP and suppress its expression in CRC cells. Downregulation of miR-182 inhibited CRC tumor growth in vivo by upregulating DAB2IP. Moreover, restoration of DAB2IP attenuated miR-182-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in CRC cells. Taken together, our findings showed that miR-182 exerted its oncogenic role in CRC by targeting DAB2IP, which may be involved in activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, shedding a novel light on the molecular mechanism of CRC tumorigenesis.

Abstract: In this work, we presented our effort to understand the effect of the operating parameters of the microwave oven (power and irradiation time) on the structural and morphological changes in ceria (CeO2) nanostructures. A series of controlled experiments were carried out to understand the crucial factors determining the formation of ceria nanostructures with spheres and rods like morphology. By adjusting the experimental parameters different ceria nanostructures such as spheres, cubes and rods were obtained. The variation of the lattice parameter and morphology of the prepared samples was discussed by structural studies. The WH analysis was implemented to calculate the average crystallite size and microstrain. The influence of morphology and microstrain on the band gap energy, luminescence and photocatalytic activity of the synthesized samples was discussed. The observed variation in the band gap was explained based on the variation of the crystallite size. Also, the observed variation in the ratio of the intensity of band gap related emission (IBg) and defects related emission (Idef) was discussed. In addition, the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the prepared ceria nanostructures with different morphology was discussed.

Abstract: We investigated the microstructures and their formation mechanisms of carbonate salt based composite phase change materials (CPCMs). Such materials typically consist of a carbonate salt as the phase change material (PCM), a thermal conductivity enhancement material (TCEM) and a ceramic skeleton material (CSM) for structure stabilisation, and are mainly for medium and high temperature thermal energy storage applications. Two carbonate salt based composites were studied with one being eutectic NaLiCO3 and the other Na2CO3. MgO and graphite flakes were used respectively as the CSM and TCEM for fabricating the composite modules. A scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was used to observe the microstructures and the salt distribution and redistribution within the composite structures during repeated melting-solidification cycles. The results showed salt migration within the composite structure during the thermal cycling. Such a microscopic motion led to a more homogenous distribution of not only the salt but also the CSM and TCEM. At a low graphite flake loading, breakage of the graphite flake was observed, suggesting stress generation during thermal cycling. The extent of the breakage reduced with increasing graphite flake loading, suggesting the stress generation be related to microscopic motion. The MgO based CSM particles were likely to be sintered, forming a porous structure. Such a structure reduced the swelling effect partially due to the use of graphite on which the salts had a poor wettability.

Abstract: Rho GTPases have been shown previously to play important roles in several cellular processes by regulating the organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. However, the mechanisms of Rho GTPases that integrate the cellular responses during regeneration have not been thoroughly elucidated. The planarian flatworm, which contains a large number of adult somatic stem cells (neoblasts), is a unique model to study stem cell lineage development in vivo. Here, we focus on cdc42, which is an extensively characterized member among Rho GTPases. We found that cdc42 is required for the maintenance of epidermal lineage. Cdc42 RNAi induced a sustained increased of cell death and led to a loss of the mature epidermal cells but without affected cell division. Our results indicate that cdc42 function as an inhibitor to block the excessive apoptotic cell death in planarian epidermal regeneration and homeostasis.

Abstract: We study the role of defects on the band-edges of bismuth-based ternary halide perovskites (A3Bi2I9) formed with cesium and methylammonium (MA) ions at the A-site. We consider a range of precursor-stoichiometries leading to different reaction environments. The intrinsic defects formed during the perovskite formation affect the materials’ band-energies. We introduce scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to probe the band-edges. Fermi energy of the perovskites could be seen to remain always closer to valence band (VB) as compared to conduction band (CB) inferring their p-type nature. Acceptor-type defects having a least formation energy have been considered to result the p-type behavior. Upon a variation in the precursor-stoichiometry in forming the perovskites, STS studies evidence a decrease in the band gap of the materials formed with BiI3-rich precursors. The change in band-energies occurs due to formation of deep-defects above the VB-edge; a shift in the CB-edge towards the Fermi energy is due to a change in the contribution of Bi(p) orbitals which form the CB of the perovskite. With methylammonium at the singly-protonated site, the material becomes defect-tolerant as evidenced by absence of deep level defects and an improvement in the parameters of solar cells formed with (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9.

Abstract: Potential induced degradation (PID) of solar cells can severely reduce a PV module's performance. In case of bifacial solar cells, the rear side is another source of PID as was found for industrially produced bifacial PERC solar cells from three different manufacturers. It is shown that a rear-side PID test can lead to more than 12% power degradation. The observed PID mechanisms are not completely recoverable implying long-term losses under field operation. This new, non-recoverable PID effects are characterized by a locally increased recombination at the rear side of the cells. From nano-scale analytics by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) are performed and PID related defects are traced back to a local Si corrosion and delamination of the passivation layers. At the Si passivation interface an increased amount of SiOx, Na and further impurities are found that indicate an electrochemically driven corrosion process under cathodic conditions.

Abstract: In this work, Cobalt Phosphate Group (Co−Pi) Modified nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoanodes films were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass by means of the hydrothermal process. The α-Fe2O3 film morphology can be tuned from nanoparticle – based patterns to high-density cabbage-like structures as Co−Pi deposition time is increased. Systematic studies were performed to clarify the mechanisms that enhance water-splitting performance of α-Fe2O3 electrodes as Co−Pi deposition time increases. All samples followed morphological and structural studies using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Chronoamperometry measurements showed that Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited higher photoelectrochemical activity than the α-Fe2O3 films. The maximum photocurrent density and incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were obtained for 30 s Co-Pi/α-Fe2O3 photoanode. All samples reached their best IPCE at 400 nm. IPCE values for 30 s Co-Pi hematite films were 5 times higher than that of α-Fe2O3 sample. For the α-Fe2O3 photoanode, the H2 evolution rate was ∼5.14 μmol cm−2 h−1. After decoration by Co-Pi, the rate increases to ∼7.31 μmol cm−2 h−1, showing an enhancement of about ∼ 42.2%. It was found that under illumination, the Co−Pi catalyst can efficiently collect and store photogenerated holes from the α-Fe2O3 electrode. This charge separation reduces surface state recombination, leading to the enhancement of the efficiency of water oxidation. Thicker catalytic Co−Pi films were found to increase charge separation and surface area, which in turn increase water oxidation efficiency. These results provide important new understanding of the catalytic enhancement and limitations of the Co−Pi catalyst once coupled to semiconductor electrodes for water-splitting applications.

Abstract: This paper deals with the synthesis, characterization, thermal properties and thermal reliability of 1-tetradecanol and 1-octadecanol-succinic acid esters as a novel solid–liquid phase change materials (PCM) for thermal energy storage (TES). Ditetradecyl succinate (DTS) and dioctadecyl succinate (DOS) were synthesized by using succinic acid and excessive amount of fatty alcohol under vacuum and without catalyst. The esterification reaction yield was found above 95%. High purity ester compounds were characterized structurally by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy techniques as thermophysical properties were investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). DSC method was exploited for determination of phase change temperature, enthalpy, total enthalpy and specific heat (Cp) of DTS and DOS. Thermophysical properties of the produced esters were similar to fatty alcohols. Phase change temperatures and enthalpies were slightly lower than those of pristine fatty alcohols which were explained by the succinate distortion replaced by hydrogen bonding interactions. The DSC analyses pointed out that the phase change temperatures of TDS for heating period were between 47 °C and 46 °C as corresponding enthalpy for cooling period was between 202.4 and 197.5 Jg-1 respectively. The phase change temperature and enthalpy of DOS were between 64 °C and 63 °C and 194.9 and 191.7 Jg-1 respectively. In addition, the thermal cycling test including 1000 accelerated cyclings was conducted to determine the thermal reliability of the synthesized PCMs and structural and thermal consistency of the material were checked by post FT-IR and DSC analysis. Morphology and thermal endurance limits of the DTS and DOS were also investigated using POM and TGA respectively. Based on the results, it was concluded that the synthesized novel PCMs had considerable potential due to their satisfactory thermal properties, thermal reliability and stability.

Abstract: Bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) has been demonstrated as a potential candidate for photovoltaic material because of favorite band gap (1.5 eV), effective charge dissociation, high carrier mobility, and long carrier lifetime. In this work, we synthesis the Bi2O2S nanocrystals by hydrothermal method, and incorporate Bi2O2S nanocrystals as a third component into poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b'] dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-(2-ethylhexy) carbonyl] thieno [3,4-b] thiophenediyl]] (PTB7):acceptor [6,6]-pheny C71-butyric acid methy ester (PC71BM) binary polymer solar cells (PSCs). The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary PSCs is obviously improved by 21.8% in comparison with binary PSCs (from 8.79% to 10.71%) by adding 1 wt% Bi2O2S nanocrystals. Introduction of Bi2O2S nanocrystals into the PTB7:PC71BM system can expand absorption range of sunlight in the PSCs, effectively enhance the crystallinity of PTB7 and optimize the surface morphology of photoactive layer, which leads to more efficient photon harvesting, enhances exciton dissociation, accelerates charge carrier transport and reduces charge recombination. Moreover, the addition of appropriate amounts of Bi2O2S nanocrystals into PTB7:PC71BM can effectively improve the lifetime of PSCs due to the improvement of crystallinity of PTB7. This work demonstrates the great potential use of bismuth compounds for photovoltaic devices fields.

Abstract: The way of application is an important issue in thermal energy storage (TES) materials. Phase change materials are encapsulated to prevent leakage and to get application advantage. At the last decade, microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs) are produced with functional outer surfaces. In this work preparation, characterization, and thermophysical property determination of microencapsulated n-octadecane in poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene-co-acrylamide) shell was studied. N-octadecane core P(St-co-DVB-co-AAm) shell microcapsules were prepared with 0.5, 1, and 2% AAm contend to make the outer surface functional. Divinylbenzene was used as the cross-linker to produce stability and unimodal microcapsule size distribution. Microcapsules were synthesized by miniemulsion polymerization method, and characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), polarized optical microscopy (POM), particle sizer distribution (PSD) instrument, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. The average melting and freezing onset temperatures of the MEPCMs were found slightly lower than the phase transition temperatures of n-octadecane core material as the enthalpy values were affected from the amide pendant group contend. Besides, produced microcapsules were found stable up to 148 °C.

Abstract: Recently, deep colored inorganic pigments with high infrared reflectance have attracted much attention for using in the building coating field because of their ability to reflect solar heat radiation and reduce the temperature of the roofs and outside walls. However, pollutants that are present in the air require the coatings to possess self-cleaning and anti-soiling properties. In this work, black infrared-reflective pigments, fluorinated acrylic resin emulsion and a small number of SiO2 nanoparticles were mixed in silicon resin emulsion, and the resulting mixture was coated on an aluminum plate. After drying, black coatings with high infrared reflectance, superhydrophobic (SH) and obvious anti-soiling properties were created. Between wavelengths of 1250–2500 nm, the infrared-reflectivity of the prepared cool coating is higher than that of the white SiO2 coatings. Under the radiation of a 275-Watt infrared lamp positioned at a height of 40 cm, the surface temperature of the cool coating is 30 °C lower than that of the carbon black coating (90 °C), and only 5–10 °C higher than that of the white SiO2 coating. Furthermore, the heat-reflective coating exhibited stable SH properties to both rain and UV irradiation, which allow for the coating to possess self-cleaning ability and retain its heat-reflective properties over a long period of time.

Abstract: PH1000/graphene (Gra) composite film with thermally-induced wrinkles has been employed as an electrode in organic solar cells (OSCs) to enhance the device efficiency. The wrinkled PH1000/Gra composite electrode exhibits excellent transmittance of 88.5% at 550 nm, decreased sheet resistance of 147.5 Ω sq−1 and appropriate work function of ~4.9 eV compared to pristine graphene. OSCs with wrinkled composite electrode possess enhanced short circuit current (JSC) compared to that of planar devices due to the wrinkles-induced enhancements in light absorption and charge collection. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs with wrinkled composite electrode is 4.67%, which is 60% or 35% higher than that of planar devices based on the pristine graphene (2.93%) or PH1000 (3.45%) electrode, respectively. Corresponding PCE is comparable to that of the conventional ITO-based OSCs (5.08%). Even better, flexible OSCs with PH1000/Gra composite electrode exhibited excellent mechanical stability compared to ITO device. The enhanced efficiency of the OSCs demonstrates that the wrinkled PH1000/Gra composite electrode is a promising candidate for efficient and flexible optoelectronic application.

Abstract: Background
Long non-coding RNA H19 (lncRNA H19) has been widely reported in esophageal cancer (EC), and previous study had found that lncRNAH19 was up-regulated in EC and promoted cell proliferation and metastasis. However, the mechanism still needs further studied.
Methods
Levels of lncRNA H19 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in matched samples from 30 patients. Expression levels of lncRNA H19, let-7, STAT3 and EZH2 were additionally identified by qRT-PCR and western blotting in five EC cell lines. The effects of lncRNA H19 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in cell lines were performed by MTT assay, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry in vitro, and tumor formation was detected by xenograft nude mice model in vivo. The expression level of STAT3, EZH2, β-catenin, and EMT and metastasis related molecules such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail-1 and MMP-9 was assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Finally, luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were used to verify the interaction between lncRNA H19 and let-7c, and their subsequent regulation of STAT3.
Results
Knockdown of lncRNA H19 repressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as EMT and metastasis via STAT3-EZH2-β-catenin pathway, while lncRNA H19 regulated STAT3 negatively regulated let-7c in EC cell lines.
Conclusions
lncRNA H19 facilitates EMT and metastasis of EC through let-7c/STAT3/EZH2/β-catenin axis.

Abstract: A new type of gel polymer electrolyte composed of free-standing aramid nanofibers was used to fabricate all-solid-state near-infrared (NIR) electrochromic devices for NIR sheltering applications. This new type of gel polymer electrolyte showed excellent mechanical and heat endurance compared with currently available gel polymer electrolytes. The good film-forming ability of the aramid nanofibers makes assembling the electrochromic devices more convenient. The as-fabricated device showed an optical modulation of about 40% at 980 nm and achieved a coloration efficiency of 79.5 cm2 C−1, values that are larger than those previously reported for other electrochromic devices with similar structures. It is expected that aramid nanofibers-LiClO4-based electrolyte films with high mechanical and heat endurance will have potential applications in spacecraft thermal control, optical communication, and biomedical analysis.

Abstract: Spectrally-selective solar absorbing coatings based on the Ti1-xAlxN system were deposited using DC magnetron sputtering. Due to their refractory nature and very suitable optical properties, these were considered for high temperature solar thermal energy conversion. The composition of Ti1-xAlxN, (effectively, the Ti/Al ratio) was optimized to achieve a maximized solar absorptance. The optimum composition was then tested in a tandem absorber which included anti-reflective layers. A stainless steel substrate was used in order to simulate service in parabolic trough-based power plants that use stainless steel pipe to carry the heat-transfer fluid. High temperature annealing of the stack caused structural modifications but the solar absorptance of 92% was retained even after annealing at 900 °C.

Abstract: Utilizing solar energy to evaporate water is a green and promising approach in addressing the issue of global freshwater shortage and water pollution. Carbon materials have gained extensive research attention as efficient solar absorbers for solar steam generation owing to the non-toxic nature and environmental friendliness. In this work, the metal-organic framework (MOF) derived porous carbon (MDPC) materials were first employed as solar absorbers for enhancing water evaporation. An efficient surface heating and evaporation system was designed by coating the leaf-like two-dimensional (2D) MOF precursor on stainless steel mesh followed by calcination (MDPC/SS mesh), and then in conjunction with a floating air-laid paper wrapped polyethylene (EPE) foam. The prepared solar evaporator with unique light trapping structures shows a high solar absorption (>97%), excellent hydrophilicity, and great surface heat localization for solar steam generation. Consequently, a photo-thermal conversion efficiency of 84.3% with an evaporation rate of 1.222 kg m−2 h−1 was achieved under one sun illumination. Furthermore, the MDPC/SS mesh shows good recyclability and durability. This work opens a new avenue for the application of MOF derived carbon as photo-thermal material in the field of solar steam generation.

Abstract: A combination of near infra-red (NIR) photon harvesting and cobalt electrolytes having deeper redox energy level are needed for the fabrication of high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A logical molecular design of unsymmetrical squaraine dye (SQ-110) as a representative of NIR dyes has been demonstrated to function well in DSSC using cobalt complex redox electrolyte. Problem of mass transport limitations due to the bulky cobalt complex ions leading to relatively enhanced charge recombination was amicably solved by single as well as multiple compact metal oxide surface passivation on both of the transparent conducting oxide substrate as well as mesoporous TiO2. Complete absence of light absorption beyond 550 nm wavelength region by D-35 and utilization of a complementary light harvesting dye SQ-110 led to efficient wide wavelength photon harvesting. DSSC fabricated using a dye cocktail of D-35 and SQ-110 in 4:1 ratio resulted in to photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.2%, which is much higher as compared to the constituent individual sensitizers D-35 (3.6%) and SQ-110 (1.9%). This synergistic enhancement in PCE by dye cocktail was associated with the mutual co-operation of respective dyes in terms controlling the dye aggregation and complementary photon harvesting. In this dye cocktail system, D-35 is involved in the prevention of dye aggregation, lower wavelength photon harvesting and energy transfer induced photocurrent enhancement.

Abstract: This study analyses thermomechanical stresses in silicon solar cells after the soldering process by finite element modeling. An experimentally validated model shows compressive and tensile stresses, longitudinal and transversal to a busbar or a pad row on the surface of a silicon solar cell. The impact of the interconnector segments at and in between two solder pads was investigated and characteristic locations of maximum stress were identified. In addition, the influence of the layout of the contact metallization on the thermomechanical stress was identified by geometry variations to reveal design guidelines that lead to reduced thermomechanical stress in a solar cell after the soldering process. The model results reveal maxima of the tensile stress located at the outermost contacts. Furthermore, a significant influence of the distance between the outermost contact areas and the solar cell edge was determined; with decreasing distance, the compressive stress maxima are higher, but in contrast the more critical tensile stress maxima decrease. For connected pad rows tensile stress maxima are larger compared to single pad connection, which shows the influence of the interconnector segments in between the solder joints of a pad row. After several stages of thermal cycling, electroluminescence measurements showed, in compliance with the model results, contact damages, mainly at the outermost contacts. Furthermore, connected pad rows revealed a steadily growing amount of damaged contacts, whereas single solder joints showed no defects up to 400 thermal cycles.

Abstract: Advancements in solar energy harvesting technologies call for innovative approaches to meet the ever-growing energy demand. This study exploits the plasmonic interaction of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) with fluorophores to improve the optical performance of Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs). Plasmonic Luminescent Solar Concentrator (PLSC) with dimensions of 45 × 45 × 3 mm3 containing Lumogen Red305 dye and gold core silver shell nanocuboids (Au@Ag NCs) were fabricated and characterized. Plasmonic coupling in the PLSC device was influenced through spacing and spectral overlap between the nanocuboids (NCs) and Red305 dye. The spacing between Au@Ag NCs and Red305 dye was controlled by the doping concentration of Au@Ag NCs for acquiring a homogeneous sample. The optical performance of PLSC waveguides was investigated through edge emission measurements of the waveguides while varying the doping concentration of Au@Ag NCs. A maximum enhancement of 30% in the fluorescence was achieved for PLSC device containing an optimal doping concentration (1.1 ppm) of Au@Ag NCs. A transition from maximum fluorescence enhancement to quenching was demonstrated, emphasizing the importance of MNP doping concentration and spectral overlap when coupling Au@Ag NC and Red305 dye molecules. At high doping concentrations of Au@Ag NCs, non-radiative energy transfer from Red305 dye molecules to the Au@Ag NCs made quenching a dominant effect. Monocrystalline silicon solar cells were attached to one edge of the PLSC waveguides. For the sample with 1.1 ppm Au@Ag NCs doping concentration, the power conversion efficiency was found to be 1.2 times higher than the power conversion efficiency of 0 ppm sample.

Abstract: We demonstrated the use of an additional cathode layer of zirconium acetylacetonate (ZAC) prepared in IPA for Perovskite solar cells (PSC) and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 15.2%, which is about 25% higher when compared to a control device with only PCBM. Our results indicated that IPA was the best alcohol-based solvent to obtain a smooth film and also prevented any corrosion of the underlying layers. We investigated the surface effects of adding the layer and also realized an optimized concentration of 1.5 mg/ml was best for device efficiency as well as reduced the RMS to 3 nm. Dark-current time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were used to understand the effect of the thickness and concentration of the ZAC layer on the performance of the device.

Abstract: We report on the use of a high bandgap metal-oxide at the front interface of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells in a point contact concept for reduced interface recombination. Highly resistive HfO2 is applied on the CIGS surface by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Aspects of the surface passivating effect of HfO2 on CIGS were investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), electron beam induced current (EBIC) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Two structuring methods for point contact formation are compared, a lithographic top-down and a simple bottom-up approach using NaCl as template. The former method employed a plasma etch step which was found to degrade the performance of solar cells when applied on the CIGS surface. The template method omitted sputtering and allowed patterning of HfO2 up to 10 nm thickness without adversely impacting the open-circuit voltage (VOC). EBIC revealed an improved carrier collection due to the HfO2 coating and a long term stable PL decay was observed. Yet, the point contact concept with HfO2 was not significantly influencing the performance of a CIGS solar cell for the investigated parameter range.

Abstract: In order to overcome the freezing and overheating problems of solar collectors, a novel dual-phase change material (PCM) flat plate collector was proposed in this research. There were two layers of PCMs in the solar collector, one layer material with a phase change temperature of 70 °C and another with a phase change temperature of 15 °C, respectively. They were placed in the space under the absorber plate in the dual-PCM collector. Frost and High-temperature resistance performance of the novel dual-phase change material solar collector was tested systematically in a laboratory. The experimental results showed that the time taken for the temperature of the absorber plate to increase from 60 °C to 78 °C could be prolonged by 1.6 h under high temperature conditions. Furthermore, the low-melting point PCM can substantially slow the temperature decrease of the collector by solidifying and releasing heat under the low-temperature conditions. And the time taken for the temperature of the absorber plate to decrease from 19 °C to 10 °C could be prolonged by 6.4 h and 3.1 h when low-melting PCM placed below high-melting PCM and the high-melting PCM placed below low-melting PCM. Thus it can be seen that the dual-PCM collector can be used to overcome the phenomenon of overheating and freezing. In addition, compared with an ordinary flat plate collector, the efficiency of the dual-PCM collector was increased by 24.1% and 19.6% when placing low-melting PCM below high-melting PCM and in the opposite condition respectively.

Abstract: Sb2Se3 is a rapidly advancing sustainable thin film solar cell technology demonstrating 9.2% conversion efficiency recently. Because of its unique quasi-1D crystal structure, the orientation of absorbers plays a key role in charged carrier transport and therefore in solar cell performance. However, deeper understanding how deposition conditions affect film orientation and ability to control it are missing. Herein using vapor transport deposition (VTD) method we studied growth process of Sb2Se3 on Mo, MoSe2, CdS, ZnO and TiO2 substrates. We varied the temperature of substrate and source to imitate various growth conditions. We have found three distinct growth regimes at which films exhibit characteristic features. Compact and large grained morphology with explicit (hkl, l≠0) orientation was achieved when high growth rate regime governed by evolution selection principle was induced on all substrates. Proposed growth model takes into account the influence of substrate and provides directions to obtain Sb2Se3 films with desired morphology and orientation. In conclusion, we have compared morphological properties of Sb2Se3 films synthesized by various evaporation based methods in literature with the properties predicted by the model. A fair agreement was found, proposing that this model can serve as a guideline for Sb2Se3 thin film optimization using evaporation based methods.
