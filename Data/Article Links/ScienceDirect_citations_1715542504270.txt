Abstract: The electron diffusion in the nanostructured photoanode of a dye-sensitized solar cell is affected by both the nanoparticle film morphology and the electron traps in the nanoparticles. The effect of the traps is to reduce the diffusion coefficient from its trap free value, which is deleterious to the cell performance. However, there is a time for the effect of the traps to be felt, which can be identified with a local or quasi equilibration time. We address this issue here and show how the volume of the nanoparticles, the equilibrium chemical potential and the temperature affect this time and can make the local equilibration time comparable to the electron transit time across the film.

Abstract: Nanowire arrays (NWAs) have sufficient “light trapping effect” to more efficiently collect sunlight. Due to the excellent detection background of the solar blind band UV detector, and in order to improve the quantum efficiency of the photocathode, the core component of the detector, the graded Al-component AlxGa1-xN nanowire arrays (NWAs) photocathode with the built-in electric field is proposed. Based on the geometric optimization of wave optics, the effects of the number of layers and the thickness of the graded compositional nanowires on light absorption are also studied, and we designed three kinds of graded Al-component AlxGa1-xN nano-arrays with variable structure (nano-cylinder, truncated nano-cones, nano-cones). The results show that the conical nanowires can enhance the light-trapping ability of the solar-blind band and obtain the high sensitivity characteristics of the threshold wavelength, which effectively concentrate the light in the center of nanostructure. Therefore, we strongly recommend the introduction of conical nanostructures to address the high reflectance and carrier lifetime of short-wavelength UV detectors, which would be a beneficial innovation for graded Al-component AlxGa1-xN NWAs photocathodes.

Abstract: Here we report a certified efficiency of up to 25.11% for silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells on a full size n-type M2 monocrystalline-silicon (c-Si) wafer (total area, 244.5 cm2). An ultra-thin intrinsic a-Si:H buffer layer was introduced on the c-Si wafer surface using a 13.56 MHz home-made RF-PECVD with low deposition rate showing superior surface passivation. The ultra-thin i-a-Si:H film with both higher microstructure factor (R*) and H content evidently increases the SHJ solar cell open-circuit voltage (VOC) by 2 mV, and moreover, short-circuit current (ISC) and fill factor (FF) are also notably improved, resulting in a 0.52% absolute cell efficiency enhancement, in which FF is the main cause. In order to explore high conversion efficiency SHJ solar cells, both home-made RF-PECVD and commercial VHF-PECVD (40.68 MHz) are employed for deposition of the i-a-Si:H passivation layer. As a result, the efficiency of RF-PECVD-prepared SHJ cell is 0.21% higher than that of VHF-PECVD-prepared, mainly driven by VOC and ISC boost. This work offers a useful tool for fabrication of high performance SHJ solar cells which could be employed in mass production.

Abstract: Dynamic radiative cooling with variable emissive power is experimentally demonstrated in this study by a wavelength-selective tunable metafilm emitter, which consists of an opaque aluminum film, a sputtered silicon spacer, and a thermochromic vanadium dioxide (VO2) layer fabricated by a furnace oxidation method. The temperature-dependent spectral emittance, experimentally obtained from spectral reflectance measurements, clearly shows a pronounced emission peak around 10 μm wavelength when the VO2 experiences an insulator-to-metal phase transition near 65 °C. The tunable metafilm emitter achieves a significant total emittance increase from 0.14 at room temperature to 0.60 at 100 °C. Theoretical modeling based on thin-film optics indicates that the emission enhancement at high temperatures is realized by Fabry-Perot cavity resonance with the metallic VO2 film. Moreover, a calorimetry-based thermal vacuum experiment was conducted and the enhanced thermal emission of the fabricated tunable metafilm sample was experimentally demonstrated at temperatures higher than the phase transition temperature, compared to black, aluminum and doped silicon samples, whose emittance changes little near room temperatures. The developed tunable metafilm emitter with variable spectrally-selective emittance in the mid-infrared holds great promise for both terrestrial and extraterrestrial dynamic radiative cooling applications.

Abstract: In this work, electrochromic polymer (ECP)/exfoliated graphene (EG)/silver nanowires (AgNWs) composite film on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate (ECP/EG/AgNWs/ITO) is prepared, and further assembled into the electrochromic device (ECD). We investigate the performance, bleaching and coloration kinetics of device based on the composite film using polythiothene (PT) as model polymer. The results indicate that the ECD based on PT/EG/AgNWs/ITO possesses large optical contrast (36%), high coloration efficiency (234 cm2/C), fast response time (the coloration and bleaching time are 6.63 and 0.71 s), and exhibits stable cycling. In comparison with the device based on PT film on bare ITO (PT/ITO), the optical contrast of device based on PT/EG/AgNWs/ITO is doubled (18 → 36%), and its coloration efficiency increases by 42% (165 → 234 cm2/C). Additionally, we can find that the dynamic processes of bleaching and coloration are all divided into three parts: I, primary stage; II, middle stage; III, late stage. The primary bleaching and coloration are completed in the first two stages. In stage II, the rate constants of bleaching and coloration can be obtained from the linear regression curves, and these rate constants of ECD based on PT/EG/AgNWs/ITO are higher. This study lays a foundation for quantitative analysis of bleaching and coloration processes and the construction of EC kinetic model.

Abstract: Amorphous tin-gallium oxide (a-SGO) grown with atomic layer deposition was evaluated as a buffer layer in (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells in search for a new material that is compatible with a variety of absorber band gaps. Hard and soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on absorber/a-SGO stacks combined with J–V characterization of solar cells that were fabricated, showed that the conduction band alignment at the absorber/a-SGO interface can be tuned by varying the cation composition and/or growth temperature. Here, the surface band gap was 1.1 eV for the absorber. However, optical band gap data for a-SGO indicate that a suitable conduction band alignment can most likely be achieved even for wider absorber band gaps relevant for tandem top cells. A best efficiency of 17.0% was achieved for (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se2/a-SGO devices, compared to η = 18.6% for the best corresponding CdS reference. Lower fill factor and open-circuit voltage values were responsible for lower cell efficiencies. The reduced fill factor is explained by a larger series resistance, seemingly related to interface properties, which are yet to be optimized. Some layer constellations resulted in degradation in fill factor during light soaking as well. This may partly be explained by light-induced changes in the electrical properties of a-SGO, according to analysis of Al/SGO/n-Si metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors that were fabricated and characterized with J–V and C–V. Moreover, the introduction of a 1 nm thick Ga2O3 interlayer between the absorber and a-SGO improved the open-circuit voltage, which further indicates that the absorber/a-SGO interface can be improved.

Abstract: Reflective coating for cool pavement is one of the most effective ways to reduce pavement temperature, save energy, improve human thermal comfort and mitigate surface urban heat island effect. However, combined natural weathering condition affect the optical properties of reflective cool pavement coatings and often cause performance deterioration over time. Besides, natural weathering exposure experiment often costs long periods and leads to poor comparison. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a reliable evaluation method of accelerated weathering experiment and investigate the effect of weathering on the performance of coatings. This study determines the accelerated weathering periods through the combined accelerated factor calculation considering single factor of temperature, moisture and ultraviolet radiation. Ten types of reflective cool pavement coatings contained three different anti-aging additives with the initial reflectance of 40%–75% were prepared. The optical properties, color space and chemical reactions of them before and during the accelerated process were explored. This study yields a total reflectance change of white coatings by less than 10% and that of colored coatings by less than 5%, which is mainly related to yellowness and fading. Reflective cool pavement coatings in light colors are more likely to be weathering aged. The variation of lightness and optical properties is still in a linear relationship during the weathering process. Finally, coatings with 2% ZnO in nanoparticle sizes could effectively slow down the degradation of chain scission reactions and thus improve the durability of reflective coatings.

Abstract: Mutations in fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) and TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43; TARDBP) are known to cause the severe adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Proteinopathy caused by cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, mitochondrial stress and proteasomal stress and the formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic aggregates and inclusions is a hallmark of ALS. FUS and TDP-43, which are DNA/RNA binding proteins that regulate transcription, RNA homeostasis and protein translation are implicated in ALS proteinopathy. Disease-causing mutations in FUS and TDP-43 cause sequestration of these proteins and their interacting partners in the cytoplasm, which leads to aggregation. This mislocalization and formation of aggregates and SGs is cytotoxic and a contributor to neuronal death. We explore how loss-of-nuclear-function and gain-of-cytoplasmic function mechanisms that affect FUS and TPD-43 localization can generate a ‘stressed out’ neuronal pathology and proteinopathy that drives ALS progression.

Abstract: We investigate the stability of the effective lifetime τeff and the recombination current density parameter J0 in n-type silicon samples with symmetric phosphorus doped poly-Si/SiOx structures, and identify factors that contribute to the passivation degradation behavior. It is found that the surface passivation quality of phosphorus doped polysilicon passivating contacts degrades upon dark annealing and light soaking at temperatures between 75 °C and 200 °C, which can lead to a pronounced increase of the recombination current density parameter J0 (one-side) from below 10 fA/cm2 to 50 fA/cm2 or above. The degradation is only detected on fired wafers, whereas the surface passivation quality is found to be stable in the non-fired sister samples. Surprisingly, a recovery of τeff and J0 is observed after the degradation. The degradation and regeneration behaviors depend strongly on temperature and light intensity, and the presence of silicon nitride (SiNx) capping layers during the light soaking. Increasing the annealing temperature dramatically increases the rate of the degradation and the regeneration process, and at the same time reduces the magnitude of the degradation. The regeneration process appears to be affected by the presence of SiNx films during the light soaking treatment. Samples with SiNx films removed after firing suffer a significantly larger degradation upon light soaking without any lifetime regeneration. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements reveal negligible change in the structural property and crystalline quality of the polysilicon layer during the degradation.

Abstract: Objective
The purpose of this study was to establish and validate a nomogram to predict the prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from multiple perspectives.
Results
A total of 98,640 eligible patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 69,048) and a validation set (n = 29,592). The baseline characteristics of the two sets were similar. We used clinical data from patients in the training set for univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Twelve independent risk factors were incorporated for constructed a prognostic nomogram. And the nomogram with a concordance index of 0.777 (95 % CI, 0.775 to 0.779) for overall survival. The calibration curve results showed that the actual survival rate was consistent with the predicted survival rate. The area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that the nomogram has a high prediction of the overall survival rate in patients with NSCLC.
Conclusion
We have developed a nomogram with high prediction accuracy and discrimination ability, which can help clinicians making personalized survival predictions for NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Sunlight-induced phase-change PEG/SiO2-dye composites based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dye-grafted silicon dioxide (SiO2) network were prepared by a facile sol-gel process. The structure and thermal properties of PEG/SiO2-dye composites were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, DSC and TG. The developed PEG/SiO2-dye composites exhibited unique characteristics, such as excellent shape-stabilized properties, thermal stability, a broad sunlight absorption range, and high phase change enthalpy (167.0 J/g). More importantly, the PEG/SiO2-dye composites exhibited a high light-to-thermal energy conversion and storage efficiency (85%–88%). After 300 light-induced phase transition cycles, PEG/SiO2-dye composites maintained thermal reliability and long-term sunlight exposure durability. Thus, PEG/SiO2-dye composites as a novel sunlight-induced phase change material showed great potential for applications in solar energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: Activating foreign genes in bovine skeletal muscle is necessary in the study of the role of related genes in skeletal muscle development and the effects on skeletal muscle formation, especially in the study of transgenic cattle. At this time, a skeletal muscle-specific promoter should be selected to initiate a functional foreign gene. Here, calpain3 (CAPN3) was found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle and skeletal muscle cells by real-time PCR. Next, 5′ deletion analysis of the bovine CAPN3 promoter was performed and showed that Q5(−495/+40) region was the core promoter of the bovine CAPN3. A key regulatory site (−465/−453) in CAPN3 core promoter was associated with the transcription factor, MyoD, which is a skeletal muscle-specific transcription factor. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of MyoD and CAPN3 were positively correlated during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. The overexpression of MyoD enhanced the activity of the bovine CAPN3 core promoter. The core promoter Q5(−495/+40) could drive the exogenous gene EGFP and the fat-specific expression gene PPARγ in skeletal muscle cells. In summary, our study obtained a bovine skeletal muscle-specific promoter and provided a basis for studying the role of functional genes in the growth and development of skeletal muscle. It also provides a basis for studying the transcriptional regulation mechanism of CAPN3.

Abstract: Laser doping is a promising route to realise industrially compatible processing of local contacts for high-efficiency solar cells, especially when the same film acts as both dopant source and passivation layer. In this work we demonstrate simultaneous local contact opening and n+ laser doping of silicon from positively charged POx/Al2O3 thin-film stacks, which also provide outstanding passivation of n-type silicon surfaces. Local n+ doped regions with sheet resistance ranging from 35 to ~540 Ω/□ are formed using single nanosecond laser pulses with varying fluence. ECV profiling shows net n-type doping in all cases, confirmed by SIMS profiling to be due to phosphorus from the POx layer. J0 of metallised laser-doped regions is consistent with values achieved for state-of-the-art furnace diffusions with similar sheet resistance, confirming that laser-induced recombination-active defects are avoided. A minimum J0 of 540 fA cm−2 is obtained for metallised laser-doped regions formed from POx/Al2O3 passivation stacks having J0 of 2.5 fA cm−2. The combination of outstanding passivation of uncontacted n-type regions offered by POx/Al2O3, with self-aligned formation of locally-diffused contact openings via single-step laser processing, opens up exciting possibilities for simplified fabrication of high-efficiency cell structures.

Abstract: Cesium tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) has potential applications in the field of energy-saving window glasses due to its visible light transparency and near-infrared (NIR) shielding ability. In order to further improve the NIR shielding performance and realize low-cost large-scale production of tungsten bronze, in this work, K, Cs co-doped tungsten bronze (KmCsnWO3, m + n = 0.32) were fabricated by facile solid-state reaction method. It has been clarified that K, Cs co-doping could promote the formation of W5+ and thus enhance the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Moreover, the K, Cs co-doping is conducive to the formation of single or double bond between W5+ and O, and the double bond W5+=O can increase the strength of small polaron effect and greatly improve the NIR shielding at wavelength 730–1100 nm. Particularly, when K:Cs (mol) = 0.2:0.8, the maximum visible light transmittance of 66.89% and near-infrared shielding rate of 98.25% could be achieved respectively. This work is of great significance for developing CsxWO3 tungsten bronze with improved NIR shielding performance and realizing its industrial production and practical applications in the field of energy-saving windows.

Abstract: The NaCl–KCl–NaF eutectic salt was designed and developed by Pandat software and experiment. Thermal transport and storage performances were determined by experimental measurements. The melting point of the NaCl–KCl–NaF eutectic salt is 604.1 °C and the fusion enthalpy is up to 398.4 J/g. The thermal conductivity average value was 1.037 ± 0.074 W/m−1·°C−1. The weight loss of NaCl–KCl–NaF eutectic salt is still less than 6.0% even up to 900 °C and the eutectic salt have very excellent thermal stability. The NaCl–KCl–NaF eutectic salt with high latent and suitable temperature have good economy performance even with expensive individual salt of NaF. The NaCl–KCl–NaF eutectic salt with suitable phase change temperature, low cost, high latent heat, excellent stability and good economy performance can be a candidate phase change material for next generation concentrated solar power with supercritical CO2 cycles.

Abstract: Storing energy as heat at temperatures above 200 °C is necessary for both efficient industrial processes and continuous solar energy generation. In this study composite shape-stabilized phase change materials were obtained using mesoporous silica as matrix and the NaNO3 – KNO3 eutectic mixture as the active heat storage component. Five types of mesoporous matrices, including hexagonal MCM-41 and SBA-15, cubic FDU-12 and two mesocellular foam silica were investigated. With the exception of MCM-41, all mesoporous matrices yielded shape-stabilized phase change materials with thermal stability above 500 °C and two melting and two crystallization events, indicating the presence of both nanoconfined and interparticle molten salts phases. The materials do not present significant enthalpy change over 50 heating – cooling cycles. The composites containing 80% wt. nitrate eutectic exhibit total heat of fusion of 69–84 Jg-1, representing ~79–96% of the theoretical values. The melting point depressions of the nanoconfined phase and “missing” heat of fusion are evidence for the presence of a non-melting, layer at the silica - nitrate interface, having a thickness of 1.9 nm. A theoretical model of the non-melting layer was used to compare the salt distribution between the layer and nanoconfined phase with experimental data. FDU-12 and mesocellular foam silica were found suitable matrices for NaNO3–KNO3 molten salts, which could be used to tailor the heat storage distribution and temperature range.

Abstract: Simple co-precipitation method followed by calcination was adopted to synthesize ZnCdSO ternary semiconductor photocatalyst. In the composite material highly crystalline and hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO along with hexagonal CdS and cubic CdO phases were separately identified. Oxygen vacancies (VO) in ZnO network and CdO phase resulted in narrowing the optical band gap, facilitating increased visible light absorption. CdS–CdO phase mediated surface defects increased significantly over the core/bulk defects in pristine ZnO, which simultaneously acted as trap-sites for charge carriers and active adsorption-sites for dyes for photocatalytic degradation. In photocatalytic Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism CdS with a higher negative potential conduction band acted as efficient reduction site and created superoxide radical anions (O2•−), whereas ZnO and CdO both having lower valence band potential acted as efficient oxidation sites and created hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Spatial separation of photo-generated charge carriers enhanced their lifetime and facilitated creating superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which, by virtue of their powerful and respective reducing and oxidizing properties, efficiently degraded the dye molecules. The hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and holes (h+) dominantly contributed in sequence, in the dye degradation process, while electrons (e−) and superoxide radicals (O2•−) had gradually lesser inputs to the phenomenon, as evidently identified via radical scavenging experiment with optical absorption study. Thus, photoactive ternary ZnO–CdS–CdO composite, produced via formation of CdO phase upon low temperature (300 °C) calcination, offered a significantly photostable superior photocatalyst for efficient dye degradation under visible light via a double Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism.

Abstract: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of interfacial engineering and defect passivation in the bulk of mixed perovskite absorber to achieve high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It is found that the extent of I–V hysteresis is most significant in PSCs with a single-layer electron transport layer (ETL) composed of SnO2 quantum dots (QD-SnO2) or SnO2 nanoparticles (NP–SnO2). The hysteresis of the PSCs can be effectively suppressed by adopting a multilayer structure for the ETL to optimize the ETL/perovskite interface. Furthermore, the performance of the PSCs can be enhanced by incorporating a controlled amount of an organic cross linker, 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis (ethylammonium iodide) (EDAI), in the mixed perovskite absorber layers. The experimental results consistently show that incorporation of an optimal amount of EDAI is effective in passivating defect states in the bulk of mixed perovskite as well as the grain boundaries and film surface, while excessive EDAI significantly degrades the photovoltaic (PV) performance of PSCs due to generation of defects and electrically insulating properties of EDAI itself. Owing to the synergistic effect contributed from optimized ETL/perovskite interface and the mixed perovskite thin film, the PSC with an active area of 0.06 cm2 exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~19.0% with negligible hysteresis and improved stability. The proposed strategies were also applied to fabricate larger area devices from 0.15 cm2 to 0.85 cm2, exhibiting the PCEs of ~12%–18% with negligible hysteresis.

Abstract: Select emerging solar cell technologies, ranging from very narrow screen-printed fingers to perovskite/silicon tandems, would benefit from a reduction of the height of the standard pyramidal texture of monocrystalline silicon wafers to below 1 μm. However, fabricating such small surface features usually compromises the requisite low reflectance and high passivation quality. Through systematic design of experiments, we demonstrate that conventional alkaline-based wet-chemical etching processes can be tuned to produce dense, spatially homogeneous, and uniformly sized sub-micrometer pyramids. Precise texture size can be further controlled by adding potassium silicate to the texturing solution to effectively slow the pyramid growth rate and promote nucleation. With pyramid size distribution data—extracted from multiple atomic force microscopy images across each wafer—we demonstrate 16 nanotextures with average pyramid sizes ranging from 62 to 512 nm, with the largest having only 0.3% of its pyramids taller than 1 μm. Six of the nanotextures exhibit light trapping and surface defect densities comparable to state-of-the-art microtextured wafers. The best nanotexture achieved an AM1.5G-weighted reflectance of 11.8% and a minority-carrier lifetime of 3.4 ms after passivation with amorphous silicon, demonstrating that smaller textures need not deteriorate solar cell performance.

Abstract: Research in the field of solar cells is generally based on balancing the trade-off between high absorption in thicker and efficient carrier extraction in thinner samples. Nanoparticle-assisted forward-scattering of the sunlight results in an artificial thickness increase for the absorption while keeping the carrier extraction thickness at its initial optimal value. According to the Beer–Lambert law, where thickness and absorption coefficients are placed alongside, thickness variations can be assumed as absorption shifts. In this study, by proposing a model based on the calculation of the effective thicknesses, we arrive at a relation for the modified absorption coefficient. Scattering efficiency and angular distribution for metallic nanoparticles with different geometrical shapes are calculated. It is shown that pyramidal, cubical and cylindrical nanoparticles offer higher Mie scattering efficiency and forward scattering ratio than those of spherical and triangular shapes. As an application, non-fullerene absorber of PTQ:IDIC with lower absorption below 500 nm is chosen to evaluate the capability of forward-scattering nanoparticles for efficiency enhancements. Our studies are conducted through fitting experimental results of this absorber by the Drift-Diffusion equations. Other than optimizing the shape, cross-section, aspect and covering ratio of the introduced nanoparticles, we demonstrate that the back contact reflectivity plays an essential role after scattering the sunlight into the absorber layer. Finally, it is demonstrated that metallic particles located in the buffer layer reduce the optimal thickness of the sample, enabling fabrication of thinner solar cells.

Abstract: Extensive application of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) in everyday life results in increased exposure to these NPs. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) guarantee sperm production throughout the male reproductive life by providing a balance between self-renewal and differentiation. We used an in vitro platform to investigate the ZnO NPs effects on SSCs. We successfully synthesized ZnO NPs. In order to investigate these NPs, we isolated SSCs from mouse testes and cultured them in vitro. Our results confirmed the uptake of ZnO NPs by the cultured SSCs. We observed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in SSC viability. Both spherical and nanosheet ZnO NPs had the same cytotoxic effects on the SSCs, irrespective of their shapes. Moreover, we have shown that short time (one day) exposure of SSCs to a low concentration of ZnO NPs (10 μg/mL) promoted expressions of specific genes (Plzf, Gfr α1 and Bcl6b) for SSC self-renewal and differentiation genes (Vasa, Dazl, C-kit and Sycp3) expressed by spermatogonia during spermatogenesis. Our study provides the first insight into ZnO NPs function in SSCs and suggests a new function for ZnO NPs in the male reproductive system. We demonstrated that ZnO NPs might promote spermatogenesis via upregulation of gene expression related to SSC self-renewal and differentiation at low concentrations. Additional research should clarify the possible effect of ZnO NPs on the SSC genome and its effects on human SSCs.

Abstract: Background
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in tumor development. The miRNA sponge is a common role played by circRNAs in various tumors, including breast cancer.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the role of circ-ZEB1 in the proliferation and apoptosis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.
Methods
The expressions of several circRNAs which were predicted to be bound with miR-448 were detected in 30 clinical TNBC tumor tissues and paired paracancer tissues. The cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to detect the TNBC cell proliferation. The TNBC cell apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL assay. The binding between circ-ZEB1 and miR-448, as well as between miR-448 and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2 K), was detected using the RNA pull-down assay and/or the luciferase reporter assay. The effect of circ-ZEB1 knockdown on TNBC tumor growth was detected using the mouse xenograft model.
Results
Compared with normal tissues and breast epithelial cells, the expression of circ-ZEB1 was markedly higher in TNBC tumor tissues and tumor cell lines. The small hairpin RNA-mediated circ-ZEB1 knockdown inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. The RNA pull-down assay and the luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding between circ-ZEB1 and miR-448, as well as between miR-448 and eEF2 K. The knockdown of circ-ZEB1 was proven to inhibit TNBC cell proliferation and tumor growth via releasing miR-448, and subsequently reducing the expression of the miR-448 target, eEF2 K.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our findings identified a new functional circ-ZEB1 in TNBC tumorigenesis, and revealed the important regulatory role of circ-ZEB1 via sponging miR-448, providing a novel insight for TNBC pathogenesis.

Abstract: In the majority of studies involving injection dependent lifetime spectroscopy, it is assumed that the investigated defect is a single-level defect following Shockley-Read-Hall recombination statistics. Nevertheless, in real life, two-level defects or multi-level defects are more common than single-level defects. In this study, we first investigated the possible consequences of misinterpreting a two-level defect as two single-level defects. A procedure to properly fit two-level defects in lifetime spectroscopy is subsequently proposed. At the end, we use boron-oxygen related defects as an experimental demonstration. Our experimental results reveal that the recombination statistics of boron-oxygen related defects cannot be explained by the coexistence of two independent single-level defects. A two-level defect parameterization appears to be more suitable.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor is a cancer driver whose nuclear localization has been associated with the progression of prostate cancer to the castration-resistant phenotype. Previous reports indicated a functional interaction between this receptor and the protein Annexin A1, which has also been associated with aggressive tumors. The molecular pathogenesis of castration-resistant prostate cancer remains largely unresolved, and herein we have demonstrated the correlation between the expression levels and localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor and Annexin A1 in prostate cancer samples and cell lines. Interestingly, a higher expression of both proteins was detected in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and the strongest correlation was seen at the nuclear level. We verified that Annexin A1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor, and by using prostate cancer cell lines knocked down for Annexin A1, we succeeded in demonstrating that Annexin A1 promotes the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor. Finally, we showed that Annexin A1 activates an autocrine signaling in castration-resistant prostate cells through the formyl peptide receptor 1. The inhibition of such signaling by Cyclosporin H inhibits the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor and its downstream signaling. The present work sheds light on the functional interaction between nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear Annexin A1 in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, strategies to inhibit the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor through the suppression of the Annexin A1 autocrine loop could represent an important intervention strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Abstract: Thin films comprising three dimensional germanium (Ge) quantum dot lattices formed by nitrogen (N) assisted magnetron sputtering deposition in alumina (Al2O3) matrix have been studied for light harvesting purposes. In order to expand the application of this material it is necessary to reduce germanium oxidation and to achieve stabilization of the germanium/alumina interface. Effects of tuning the N concentration, substrate temperature and Ge sputtering power during the films preparation are monitored. It is shown that the N presence not only reduces Ge oxidation during annealing but also affects the internal structure, size and arrangement of Ge quantum dots. Additionally, the deposition temperature and Ge sputtering power are used to tune the Ge quantum dot size, separation and the regularity of their positions. It is shown that the optical and electrical properties of the films, especially their photo-induced current, and quantum efficiency are strongly tunable by the deposition conditions. Moreover, a significant photo-response and effect of multiple exciton generation effect is observed. The materials presented could be used as a sensitive layer for photodetectors or photovoltaic light harvesting devices. The presented tools can be used for future fine tuning of the material to achieve the optimal quantum efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, interfacial solar-driven evaporation has received tremendous attention due to its potential for enhancing solar thermal conversation ability via heat localization at the evaporation interface. Diverse materials and configurations have been explored to boost the evaporation using plastic foam as the thermal insulator at the cost of complex assembly and environmental threats. Herein, we demonstrate a biodegradable, cost-effective, and scalable three-dimensional (3D) cotton paper-based solar steam generator prepared by one-step laser-induced forward transfer in the ambient atmosphere. The as-prepared evaporator has excellent solar absorption ability. The defining advantages of this method are that it can easily form a 3D structure and it is free from hazardous raw material involvement and waste generation. With further novel design by using a natural air gap instead of artificial plastic material to insulate the steam generation area and the underlying bulk water, the as-prepared evaporation system can achieve a high evaporation rate of 1711 g m−2 h−1 with a corresponding efficiency of 83% under one sun illumination. Such solar vaporization functions offer new insights into the future development of high-performance solar steam generators through an environmentally friendly and cost-effective pathway.

Abstract: Molten chlorides are promising heat transfer fluids (HTF) and thermal energy storage (TES) materials for third-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Despite their low cost and wide operating temperature ranges (400–800 °C), structural materials experience severe corrosion in commercially available chloride salts. The understanding of the corrosion mechanisms is therefore critical for successful plant design to ensure constant power generation over the 30 years of expected lifetime. This work investigates the corrosion behavior of ferritic-martensitic P91 steel and Inconel 600 nickel-based alloy in molten NaCl-KCl-MgCl2 (24.5-20.5-55.0 wt%) under isothermal conditions at 700 °C in Ar. For both alloys, the corrosion attack is associated with the selective dissolution of Cr and the removal of Cr-rich carbides from the alloy matrix leaving subsurface voids. The initial “impurity-driven” corrosion mechanism associated with the cathodic reduction of MgOH+ impurities leads to the formation of insoluble MgO on the substrates’ surface. Compositional and microstructural features of the alloys, especially the distribution of Cr-rich carbides as well as the solubility and mobility of carbon within the metallic matrix, are found to significantly affect their corrosion resistance. The experimental observations indicate, that the formation of galvanic pairs and solid-state diffusion mechanisms play a major role regarding the corrosion attack of the alloys. The systematic corrosion experiments conducted in this study indicate a lower corrosiveness of NaCl-KCl-MgCl2 ternary mixture than that of NaCl-KCl binary mixture in static conditions at 700 °C under Ar. This work gives significant insights into corrosion issues that may be expected in third-generation industrial CSP plants.

Abstract: Front/back poly-Si/SiO2 contact devices suffer from low short-circuit current density, Jsc, due to parasitic optical absorption in the front poly-Si layer. Thin poly-Si (~20 nm) allows for high Jsc but is not compatible with screen-printed fire-through contacts. We therefore study the effects of post-deposition etching of a thick poly-Si (200 nm) front layer by reactive ion etching (RIE) using the metal grid lines as a self-aligned mask. We show that passivation is maintained in the device during RIE and that Jsc is increased by a gain in the blue quantum efficiency response. However, our specific etching parameters cause non-uniform etching of the poly-Si leading to premature loss of passivation without optimal gain in Jsc. Etched, unpassivated layers can be re-passivated with a H-containing dielectric layer leading to a gain in Jsc, open circuit voltage,Voc, Fill-Factor, FF, and efficiency.

Abstract: The major obstacles delaying the commercialization of thin film solar cells based on hybrid organic halide perovskite are the expensive materials, instability of the devices and the complicated multi-step fabrication process. To solve these challenges, we present a simple and high material utilization strategy which employing the polyethyleneimine (PEI) interface abduction to in-situ fabricate perovskite layer and hole transporting layer (HTL) from MAPbI3 and Spiro-OMeTAD (SPI) mixed precursors in single step. Analyzation find that the in-situ phase separation is induced by the PEI abduction. The existence of PEI blocks SPI form Ti–O bond with bottom TiO2 surface and converting the interaction between SPI and bottom interface to Van der Waals interaction. Employing this fabrication technique for PSCs, remarkably improves materials utilization of perovskite and SPI, as well as exhibiting superior stability of about 95% initial efficiency even after 68 days of storage in ambient condition without encapsulation. We believe that our strategy will pave a new way for simple, economical and stable PSCs preparation, and provide an inspiration to simplify fabrication process for organic-inorganic electronic devices.

Abstract: Recently, the asymmetric transmission has been employed to enhance the cooling power of daytime radiative cooler [Wong et al., Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells 2018, 186: 330–339]. we argue here that the radiative cooling power cannot be improved by integrating the radiative cooler with an asymmetric electromagnetic transmission device. The reason is that the equivalence between the absorption and emission of the whole structure cannot be broken by adding the asymmetric transmission device. The theoretical analyses are provided to tackle this problem. The scattering matrix method is used to prove that the asymmetric transmission can be realized in reciprocal materials only when there is mode-to-mode conversion. However, the ray tracing method did not take the mode-to-mode conversion into account in Wong's paper, thus the absorption and emission of the whole structure could not be accurately calculated. We believe this work can prevent researchers from advancing in the improper way.

Abstract: Chromatin regulators control transcription and replication, however if and how they might influence the coordination of these processes still is largely unknown. RUVBL1 and the related ATPase RUVBL2 participate in multiple nuclear processes and are implicated in cancer. Here, we report that both the excess and the deficit of the chromatin regulator RUVBL1 impede DNA replication as a consequence of altered transcription. Surprisingly, cells that either overexpressed or were silenced for RUVBL1 had slower replication fork rates and accumulated phosphorylated H2AX, dependent on active transcription. However, the mechanisms of transcription-dependent replication stress were different when RUVBL1 was overexpressed and when depleted. RUVBL1 overexpression led to increased c-Myc-dependent pause release of RNAPII, as evidenced by higher overall transcription, much stronger Ser2 phosphorylation of Rpb1- C-terminal domain, and enhanced colocalization of Rpb1 and c-Myc. RUVBL1 deficiency resulted in increased ubiquitination of Rpb1 and reduced mobility of an RNAP subunit, suggesting accumulation of stalled RNAPIIs on chromatin. Overall, our data show that by modulating the state of RNAPII complexes, RUVBL1 deregulation induces replication-transcription interference and compromises genome integrity during S-phase.

Abstract: Since 2017, the efficiency record for cast multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells has been 22.3% using a TOPCon design on a 2 × 2 cm2 area of an n-type wafer processed in the laboratory. As the efficiency of industrial PERC and TOPCon cells on monocrystalline wafers has been higher than that, there is widespread expectation that multi-crystalline materials will be used less and less. Recently, we applied our industrial TOPCon (i-TOPCon) technology to 157.4 mm × 157.4 mm quasi-mono n-type wafers and achieved an efficiency of 23.22% with Voc of 711.9 mV with illumination for the front side, independently confirmed by ISFH CalTeC in Germany. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solar cell based on cast-mono material that exceed 23% efficiency. This gives scope that cast materials may still be used in future cell fabrication because such high efficiencies and lower cost may offset the lower production yield compared to Czochralski (Cz) wafers. We report on details about our cell structure and processing, we analyze the bulk lifetime before and after cell fabrication, and give details about the optimization of the rear passivating contact.

Abstract: A novel spectrally selective multilayer coating: Cr-(CrN/TiAlN)m-AlSiN-AlSiO on SS316 substrate/tube was deposited via Cathodic Arc Physical Vapor Deposition (CAPVD) technique. The coating exhibited state-of-the-art absorptivity (α = 0.95–0.96) and emissivity (ε = 0.09–0.11). In view of open-air solar thermal application requirements, the coating has been systematically analysed for its thermal, environmental (corrosion) and mechanical stability. The thermal cycling studies carried out at 500 °C in open-air conditions have shown no change in optical properties for about 150 cycles. Further, accelerated thermal aging tests have shown an extrapolated service life of 25 years at 411 °C. In the case of corrosion studies, up to 520 h of exposure to 5% NaCl medium, no considerable change in optical properties was observed. Further, the coatings were well adherent to the substrates/tubes (6 N of critical load) with a considerable hydrophobicity (104° contact angle). The observed results indicate that, Cr-(CrN/TiAlN)2–AlSiN–AlSiO coating may be a good choice for developing receiver tubes used in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems with best solar selective properties and the capability to withstand harsh environments like solar flux variations, thermal shocks in the presence of open-air pollutants, dust and humidity.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a scheme using the conformal coating of p-NiOx nanoparticles on the n-GaN photoanode to prevent the photoelectrodes from corrosion and thereby enhance conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the various weight ratios of NiOx (1:5 and 3:2) are explored to optimize the study. NiOx nanoparticles avoid corrosion on the n-GaN surface, decrease the solar water-splitting reaction overpotential, and enhance the photocurrent density at a working electrode applied bias of 1 V in the two-electrode system. Finally, in the stability test, the hydrogen evolution rate of NiOx (3:2) is more effective than that of pristine n-GaN even after 5 h. These results indicate that NiOx nanoparticle-decorated n-GaN gains higher photostability and hydrogen production performance in PEC cells.

Abstract: In this paper, the effect of temperature on the process of optical degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells is studied. First, we promote the theory of the degradation process we have already presented, which leads to more accurate results. Previously, in the proposed model, we had considered the density of the vacancies distributed in the perovskite layer to be constant, while in reality, their density changes over time. In order to obtain the electric field resulting from the migration of vacancies, which is, in fact, the cause of the optical degradation of the perovskite solar cells, we need the initial density of the vacancies and its temperature dependence as well as migration energy (potential barrier against the migration) of the vacancies. Using the Gibbs free energy resulting from the formation of the vacancies, the density of the vacancies is obtained. Also, by calculating the changes in electrostatic energy between the lattice ions during displacement, the migration energy is obtained. When the required parameters are presented, the temperature dependence of the optical degradation process is discussed using the proposed theory, and the results show the appropriate accuracy of this theory.

Abstract: The nuclear pore protein NUP62 localizes to spindle poles in mitosis and plays a role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis. In this study, we found that NUP62-depleted cells exhibited a defective spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and that depletion of NUP62 caused a slight decrease in MAD2 protein levels after nocodazole treatment. However, depletion of NUP62 did not cause a failure in kinetochore localization of the SAC proteins BUBR1, MAD1, and MAD2 in prometaphase. NUP62 depletion slightly prolonged mitotic timing but did not affect cell doubling time. In addition, NUP62 depletion caused a SAC defect and induced aneuploidy in human neural stem cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NUP62Q391P, a mutant protein causing autosomal recessive infantile bilateral striatal necrosis, resulted in a defect in the SAC, indicating that the amino acid residue Q391 in NUP62 is crucial for its effect on the SAC. Overall, we conclude that NUP62 maintains the SAC downstream of kinetochores and thereby ensures maintenance of chromosomal stability.

Abstract: In the past few years, a hot topic in both research and industrialization of p-type multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells is to investigate the mechanism, measurement and mitigation of the light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID), which has been found to be a bulk-sensitive degradation behavior and is dependent on the degradation condition. In this paper, we study the influence of silicon bulk property on LeTID from five representative positions along a relative low resistivity (0.82–1.33 Ω cm) p-type mc-Si brick. The evolution of degradation and regeneration under different laser illumination conditions are investigated. Identical defect capture cross section ratio k values of ~35 at mid-gap along the brick height are found. For the first time, the activation energy for degradation (Ea,deg) and regeneration (Ea,reg) along the brick are studied, which shows Ea,deg = Ea,reg and a tendency of larger values towards the brick bottom. These results indicate that the LeTID in the whole brick might be induced by a single defect and thus mitigated in a single manner. Besides, a laser illumination of 45 kW/m2 at 142 °C for 100 s is able to induce over 90% degradation for all wafers, which could be used as a universal and fast LeTID test condition.

Abstract: Poly (triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising hole transport materials (HTM) for perovskite solar cells. Highly efficient PTAA-devices have been demonstrated in both direct (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) architectures. In the inverted structures, the device suffers from poor coverage of the perovskite film over the hydrophobic PTAA surface. To address this issue, we exploited an easy and efficient approach utilizing a short-time UV treatment of the PTAA layer prior to the perovskite deposition. The UV-treatment improved the optical properties of PTAA layers, which synergistically helps the light harvesting of the perovskite. Enhanced grain sizes, together with the decrease of recombination centers in the UV treated dopant-free PTAA, lead to efficient perovskite solar cell with PCE reaching 19.17% for 0.09 cm2 active area. Moreover, the device retains over 75% of its initial efficiency after 1400 h storage in ambient condition with average relative humidity (RH) of 50%. Additionally, the effect of UV light was studied on PTAA with different molecular weights. Non-destructive UV exposure more predominantly improved the efficiency of lower molecular weight PTAA-based device. A maximum PCE of 12.3% for 1 cm2-sized cells using 5 min-UV PTAA with low MW is achieved. This investigation points to the main roles of the HTL quality for the development of high-efficiency photovoltaic solar cells and provides a fast, easy and cost-effective method toward upscaling.

Abstract: Next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are expected to work above the current temperature limit of 565 °C for the benefit of enhanced efficiency. This poses significant challenges in the construction materials, among others, in terms of corrosion. In this work, we investigate the spray-graphitization method to improve the compatibility of SS310 and SS347 with molten Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 carbonate salt. Improved compatibility was observed due to the formation of protective carbonate or carbide layers on SS347 and SS310 surfaces, respectively. Detailed characterization of the corrosion products, including chemical reactions and wettability allowed the mechanism of anticorrosion protection to be proposed, which could be used for other construction materials in direct contact with high-temperature molten salts for next-generation CSP plants and beyond.

Abstract: Reflection is the most disconcerting phenomenon for solar cover glass, and Omnidirectional Broadband Antireflective coating (OBAR) enhances the transmission of the solar cover glass and power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell. In this connection, a facile synthesis route is adapted to develop hollow MgF2 nanoparticles using Magnesium carbonate as a precursor for the first time. Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) quantifies the spatial dimensions of the nanosized substructure, and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) utilized to investigate the morphological information of MgF2 hollow nanoparticles. The deposition of MgF2 hollow nanoparticles on the solar cover glass results in OBAR coating and exhibits enhancement of 5.8–31.7% by varying angle of incidence ranging from 10 to 80o in the wavelength range of 400–1100 nm is a breakthrough of its kind. Moreover, the average transmittance results to be 97.88% in spectral range (400–1100 nm) and 99.2% in the visible spectrum at normal incidence. Further, OBAR coated glass encapsulated polycrystalline Si solar cell has shown >10% net increment in the efficiency compared to that of uncoated glass encapsulated device. Also, the developed OBAR coatings exhibited excellent mechanical and weather stability.

Abstract: Next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) technology requires a high-temperature heat-transfer fluid and thermal energy storage media. Molten MgCl2-KCl-NaCl is considered a potential candidate salt due to its thermophysical properties. However, MgCl2 presents various challenges because of its hygroscopic nature. To keep corrosion under control, this molten chloride needs to remain free of hydrates and other impurities. Here, we have developed an effective purification method for MgCl2-containing salts by 1) combining known laboratory-scale, batch-style thermal and chemical purification processes to enable scalable, continuous-style processes for commercial next-generation CSP operation; 2) improving overall efficiency and minimizing the major corrosive impurity MgOHCl by optimizing key engineering parameters such as heating temperature/time and amount of elemental Mg addition; and 3) investigating the addition of halite (NaCl) to carnallite (KMgCl3) to reduce the liquidus temperature. Laboratory-scale results suggest that 1) adding 6.5 wt% of halite and less than 0.1 wt% of elemental Mg to commercial carnallite and 2) following a heating schedule to at least 650 °C with ~3 h of holding time at that temperature can produce a ternary MgCl2-KCl-NaCl salt composition with a low liquidus temperature of about 400 °C. It also reduces the presence of the corrosive impurity, MgOHCl, from ~1 to 2 wt.% to ~0.1 wt%. Findings of these key engineering parameters should provide a pathway toward a scalable, continuous-style salt-purification process at a scale of metric tons per hour that can produce a corrosion-controlled chloride molten salt for CSP applications.

Abstract: Copper plating can provide significant cost savings over screen printed Ag for industrially produced Si photovoltaic modules, however concerns exist with regard to the durability of Cu-plated modules. This study investigated the effect of different capping layers and their method of application on the durability of Cu-plated PERC one-cell modules, with a focus on durability after damp heat (DH) testing. It is shown that the adhesion of Cu-plated fingers capped with immersion-plated Ag and Sn was poorer than that of fingers capped with light-induced plated (LIP) Ag due to the under-etching of Cu finger by corrosive additives that are present in the immersion plating formulations. It is proposed that the weak finger adhesion resulted in fingers dislodging during DH testing of the modules, thereby opening a pathway for Cu to in-diffuse into Si resulting initially in an increased non-ideal recombination and then increased series resistance due to encapsulant flowing under the dislodged finger. Increased recombination due to the Cu in-diffusion was evident in cells with poor finger adhesion through an increase of the non-ideal recombination current density, J02, of 166%, 253%, 266% for LIP Ag, immersion Ag and immersion Sn, respectively, during the first 1000 h of DH. In comparison, with stronger finger adhesion, J02 increases were <60% in the same DH period. This result highlights the importance of strong finger contact adhesion, and not just busbar adhesion, for durable Cu-plated modules and suggests that both finger and busbar adhesion are routinely monitored in the processing of Cu-plated cells.

Abstract: It is well known that the quality of contact passivation can greatly influence the efficiency of Si solar cells. In this work, the impact of annealing a wet-chemically formed silicon oxide (SiOx) tunnel layer (prior to poly-Si capping) to form SiOx/n+ poly-Si passivated contacts for high efficiency solar cells is investigated. The effect of different annealing temperatures (ranging from 425 to 900 °C) and ambients (air and forming gas), on the overall performance of the resulting SiOx/n+ poly-Si passivated contacts are studied. The efficiency potential of these SiOx/n+ poly-Si contacts is calculated from the measured values of the recombination current density (J0,contact), and the effective contact resistivity (ρcontact), according to the generalized Brendel's model. The results are compared to the reference case, i.e. non-annealed SiOx tunnel layer with poly-Si deposition. The lifetime, the fixed charge and also the SiOx tunnel layer thickness increase upon annealing at higher temperatures. The sample annealed in forming gas at 900 °C shows an increase in field effect passivation (Qtot = 1 × 1012 cm−2) as well as in chemical passivation (Dit = 3 × 1011 eV−1 cm−2), along with reduced ρcontact, indicating pinhole formation upon annealing at 900 °C. The best SiOx/n+ poly-Si passivated contact achieved J0,contact = 4.2 fA cm−2, ρcontact = 0.27 Ω cm−2 and a corresponding maximum ideal efficiency potential of 27.9%. This is 1.2% absolute higher as compared to the reference case, when no annealing of the tunnel layer is performed.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand can induce cell apoptosis in various tumor cells. However, many cancer cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand. Therefore, overcoming the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance makes it possible for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-based anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we took mesenchymal epithelial transition factor as the research target to study its role in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma. Mesenchymal epithelial transition factor gene has been proved to be an effective predictor of recurrence after hepatocellular carcinoma resection. The expression of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 were measured in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant and non-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Cyclin B1-knockdown and cyclin B1-overexpression hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand; mesenchymal epithelial transition factor knockout, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor re-introduction and cyclin B1 restored in hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand were established. And MTT, bromodeoxyuridine, flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to evaluate the effect of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand. In addition, subcutaneous tumor transplantation in nude mice was conducted to access the effect of mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and cyclin B1 on tumor formation in vivo. In conclusion, cyclin B1 enhanced the cell growth and inhibited apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. And mesenchymal epithelial transition factor promoted the cell growth and apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating cyclin B1. Therefore, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor regulates the cyclin B1 to regulate tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for regulating tumor necrosis factor-related apoptotic induction ligand resistance, which might be helpful to select drug targets in the treatment of liver cancer.

Abstract: Latent heat storage systems are applied to keep temperature of a local environment within a constant range. The process takes place via release/storage of latent heat during freezing/melting of a corresponding phase change material embedded in a shape stabilizer, which is the scaffold keeping the phase change material stationary in its molten form. In this work, a highly siliceous ZSM-5 and modified versions thereof were chosen as shape stabilizers for molecular and polymeric phase change materials (namely lauric acid and polyethylene glycol), to be impregnated using solvent assisted vacuum impregnation. The dominantly microporous analogues, parent ZSM-5 and its acid-treated derivative, were limited to 40% uptake for each phase change material. Contrastingly, a mesopore rich analogue (as formed under basic conditions) reached 65% impregnation for lauric acid and 70% for polyethylene glycol, without any leakage at 70 °C, resulting in latent heats of 106.9 J/g and 118.6 J/g for each composite, respectively. A simple prototypical real-world application demonstrated that the prepared lauric acid and polyethylene glycol composites of mesopore enriched ZSM-5 could maintain their temperatures up to 27% and 22% lower than the ambient environment under solar heating, as well as up to 20% and 26% higher when solar heating stops. The presented findings indicate mesopore enrichment improves phase change material uptake in these low cost, non-toxic zeolitic shape stabilizers, hence making them good candidates as isolation materials to address energy loss during heating/cooling of household environments.

Abstract: Full area transparent contacts are the next step in order to enhance the efficiency of silicon based passivated emitter rear cells. Here we present a full area contact based on Al2O3 and reduced TiOx. The thin Al2O3 acts as passivating tunneling layer, whereas the TiOx is used for charge carrier transport. This work provides a way to enhance the conductivity of TiOx by forming gas annealing (FGA) and doping with tantalum. Furthermore, it addresses the native SiOx without chemical treatment. A thin titanium interlayer (Ti-IL) serves this purpose. Current-voltage measurements reveal a contact resistance of 30 Ωcm2 for 50 nm of pure TiOx. Ta-doping combined with a 6 nm thick Ti-IL reduces the contact resistance by two orders of magnitude down to 0.36 Ωcm2. The passivation by an Al2O3/TiOx layer stack leads to an excellent surface recombination velocity (SRV) of 5.6 cm/s with only 3 nm Al2O3 but results in a large contact resistance of about 100 Ωcm2. This contact resistance can be reduced by three orders of magnitude down to 0.25 Ωcm2 including a 10 nm Ti-IL while still providing a sufficient SRV of about 60 cm/s. The absorption coefficient of 6.3×105 cm−1 inhibits the usage as front contact for solar cells. However, it could be used as a backside contact, since the transmission is less important on the backside of a monofacial solar cell.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a p-type semiconductor, considered as an excellent photovoltaic absorber for its high absorption coefficient in the visible region and a nearly optimal band-gap for single-junction solar cells. The simple binary composition, together with non-toxic and earth-abundant constituents make this material very promising toward industrial production of low-cost thin-film solar cells. Theoretical calculations and experimental data have confirmed that Sb2Se3 exhibits strong anisotropic optoelectronic properties, due to the presence of infinite covalent (Sb4Se6)n ribbons along the (001) direction, whereas weak van der Waals interactions occur between ribbons. In such anisotropic materials, electronic transport is strongly affected by crystal structure: when ribbons are aligned perpendicularly to the solar cell surface, a better collection of photogenerated current occurs, leading to larger photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. In order to understand the alignment mechanisms of ribbons, Sb2Se3 thin films were grown by Low-Temperature Pulsed Electron Deposition (LT-PED) technique at different temperatures (from 200 °C to 400 °C) on a variety of substrates, such as glass, molybdenum, CdS, Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) and nanostructured ZnO. The structural and morphological characterization of the Sb2Se3 films, performed by out-of-plane and in-plane X-Ray Diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that ribbon alignment along the surface normal is strongly dependent on the used substrate. The comparison between solar cells grown in substrate configuration on Mo and FTO, clearly demonstrates the influence of ribbon orientation on short-circuit current.

Abstract: The bifacial p-type silicon (p-Si) passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) are predicted to dominate the industrial bifacial solar cells. In this work, we have investigated the impact of different rear surface morphologies on the electrical performance of bifacial PERCs with both five-busbar (5BB) and nine-busbar (9BB) grid design. The passivation and optical properties with differing rear surfaces are evaluated on semi-device structures. The depth of local aluminum back surface field is hardly affected by the rear surface morphology. The calculated efficiency loss analysis indicates that the negative electrical impact with enlarged rear surface area is more serious for rear side than that of front side. The batch conversion efficiency of 9BB bifacial PERCs increases by 0.2%–0.3% comparing to 5BB ones depending on the rear surface roughness. Consequently, a highest front-side average efficiency of 22.57%, with a champion efficiency of 22.75%, has been achieved for 9BB bifacial p-Si PERCs with a nearly planar rear surface. A highest bifaciality of 78.7% is realized for both 5BB and 9BB bifacial PERCs with the roughest rear surface. We have further simulated the relative enhancement of electric generation to compare the performance of bifacial PERCs in practical application.

In addition, the thermal and optimal properties of MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid were compared to those of MWCNT and Fe3O4 nanofluids. The photo-thermal energy conversion efficiency of Fe3O4, MWCNT nanofluids and MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid increased with the concentration and decreased with the operating time. An external magnetic field significantly enhanced the photo-thermal energy conversion efficiency at 0.2 wt% MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid, the photo-thermal energy conversion efficiency was 32.8% and 45.1% with the absence and presence of an external magnetic field. Adding MWCNT nanoparticles can increase the thermal properties of the Fe3O4 nanofluid. In addition, the increase of magnetic force significantly improved the thermal conductivity of the Fe3O4 nanofluid and MWCNT/Fe3O4 hybrid nanofluid.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage system (TCES) is a novel generation of concentrated solar power (CSP) heat storage system, which has the characteristics of higher heat storage density and long-term heat storage. Ca(OH)2 is a low-cost and widely available material with great application prospects, especially in CSP system because of the suitable heat storage temperature. This research focuses on improving the heat storage efficiency of Ca(OH)2/CaO TCES system by KNO3 addition. In order to further study the effect of KNO3 addition on Ca(OH)2/CaO heat storage process, the kinetic analysis of the thermal storage process of pure and KNO3 added Ca(OH)2 was carried out and the kinetic control equations were obtained, which can provide guidance for the design of the Ca(OH)2/CaO TCES system. Results show that 10 wt% KNO3 addition can reduce the heat storage temperature to 428.49 °C and greatly accelerate the reaction with nearly no loss of heat storage density. The cycling stability of the pure as well as KNO3 added Ca(OH)2/CaO system was investigated in air and nitrogen atmospheres. The failure process of the KNO3 added Ca(OH)2/CaO in air atmosphere is revealed and it is verified that the composite material has a good cyclic stability in nitrogen atmosphere.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage at temperatures above 400 °C is critical for efficient industrial processes and continuous solar thermal power generation. Phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for both latent heat storage and improved conversion efficiencies, but their use has been prevented by the large, 5–25 % change in molar volume. Herein, shape-stabilized PCMs are prepared using 20% wt. mesoporous silica matrices and NaCl–NaBr–Na2MoO4 salt eutectic. The pristine salt mixture has a total enthalpy of 216 Jg-1 divided into a solid-solid transition at 455 °C and solid – liquid transition at 522 °C. Six mesoporous silica materials of the MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41), SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous) and mesocellular foam types were investigated as potential matrices for high temperature, shape-stabilized PCMs. All resulting composites have good thermal stability up to 650 °C. High – temperature optical microscopy shows that all samples retain their macroscopic solid shape above the salt melting point. Electron microscopy revealed a good dispersion of the silica matrix inside the molten salt phases. Both MCM-41 and SBA-15-type matrices yield PCMs with high total heat of fusion values between 169 – 178 Jg-1, in accordance to the 80% wt. salt fraction. The melting point is decreased with 5–10 °C for all composite materials, indicating nanoconfinement effects of the interparticle salt phase. This work therefore provides a new strategy for obtaining shape-stabilized materials useful for high – temperature heat storage.

Abstract: Recently, the technology of mixing phase change materials with high thermal conductivity fillers was developed, which has allowed thermal energy storage to be implemented in a wide range of industrial technologies and processes. In the present study, a hierarchical bionic porous nano-composite was prepared, which efficiently merged the nanomaterial characteristics of magnetism and high thermal conductivity in order to form a magnetically-accelerated solar-thermal energy storage method. The morphology and thermo-physical properties of materials were analysed. The experimental outcomes of phase change heat transfer demonstrated that the maximum storage efficiency increases by 102.7% when the hierarchical bionic porous structure is used, and a further 27.1% improvement can be achieved with the magnetic field. At the same time, the heat transfer process of energy storage in hierarchical porous composites under external physical fields is explained by simulation. Therefore, this magnetically-accelerated method demonstrated the superior solar-thermal energy storage characteristics within a hierarchical bionic porous structure which is particularly beneficial for the utilisation of solar direct absorption collectors and energy storage technology.

Abstract: Optically transparent p-type materials play a critical role in transparent electronics including photovoltaic (PV) devices. P-type sulfide materials offer an alternative to oxides for PV application due to improved hole transport properties. Here, we report the solution-based synthesis of earth-abundant p-type transparent conducting barium copper sulfide (α-BaCu4S3, BCS) thin films. These films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometry, Raman spectroscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. BCS films of ~100 nm thickness transmit >70% of visible light. We report on tests of the hole transport properties of these BCS films for cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics, finding that the BCS deposition process forms a beneficial tellurium (Te) rich surface on CdTe by selectively removing Cd from the surface. Based on our study, the BCS interface layer plays dual functions for CdTe PV devices as a hole transport material and as an etchant, enhancing the resulting device performance. We observed a significant increase in open-circuit voltage of CdTe solar cells with the BCS buffer layer. Additionally, we discuss semitransparent CdTe solar cells with BCS as a hole transport layer and indium tin oxide as a finishing electrode. Semitransparent CdTe solar cells shows 13.3% conversion efficiency for the front side illumination and 1.2% efficiency for back side illumination, indicating high recombination of charge carriers generated close to the rear CdTe/BCS/ITO contact.

Human CLPB forms ATP-dependent complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space,

Abstract: Human caseinolytic peptidase B protein homolog (CLPB), also known as suppressor of potassium transport defect 3 (SKD3), is a broadly-expressed member of the family of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+). Mutations in the human CLPB gene cause 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type VII. CLPB is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it contributes to anti-cancer drug resistance. The biological function of CLPB in human cells and mechanistic links to the clinical phenotypes are currently unknown. Herein, subcellular fractionation of human HEK-293 and BT-549 cells showed that a single 57-kDa form of CLPB was present in the mitochondria and not in the cytosolic fraction. Immunofluorescence staining of HEK-293 and BT-549 cells with anti-CLPB antibody co-localized with the mitochondrial staining using a MitoTracker dye. In purified intact mitochondria, CLPB was protected against externally added proteinase K, but it was susceptible to degradation after disruption of the outer membrane, indicating that CLPB resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Overexpressed CLPB, while properly trafficked to the mitochondria, appeared to form large clusters/aggregates that were resistant to extraction with non-ionic detergents and were readily visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Importantly, endogenous CLPB formed high molecular weight protein complexes in an ATP-dependent manner that were detected by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results demonstrate that ATP induces a structural change in CLPB and controls its ability to self-associate or form complexes with other proteins in the intermembrane space of mitochondria.

Abstract: Background/Aims
Myocardial infarction (MI) increases myocardial fibrosis (MF) and subsequent cardiac remodeling. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) is expressed in cardiomyocytes and plays an important role in cardiovascular regulation. In this study, we intend to use a rat model of myocardial infarction to evaluate the effects of CCK-8 on myocardial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into 3 groups: sham operation, MI + NaCl, and MI + CCK-8. All rats were subjected to left coronary artery ligation to induce MI or sham operation and then treated with CCK-8 or saline for 28 days. After 4 weeks, echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function and myocardial fibrosis was evaluated using H&E and Masson's Trichrome-stained sections. The levels of BNP, CCK-8 in the plasma of all rats were detected by ELISA; RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was also adapted to detect differentially expressed genes in myocardial tissues of each group. Myocardial expression of fibrosis markers was analyzed by western blotting, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR.
Results
CCK-8 was demonstrated to improve left ventricular function and results of H&E staining, Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed that CCK-8 attenuated MF. Gene expression profiles of the left ventricles were analysed by RNA-seq and validated by qRT-PCR. Cardiac fibrosis genes were downregulated by CCK-8 in the left ventricle.
Significance
CCK-8 can alleviate fibrosis in the noninfarcted regions and delay the left ventricular remodeling and the progress of heart failure in a MI rat model.

Abstract: The present work is a continuation of our earlier work in which high entropy alloy MoNbHfZrTi is used as a raw material to prepare solar absorber coating. In this work, we have further investigated a novel Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 multilayer color solar selective absorbing coating, including structure, optical properties, thermal stability and corrosion performance. The results of TEM and XRD indicate that the Al film has nanocrystalline nature and MoNbHfZrTiN, MoNbHfZrTiON and SiO2 are amorphous structure. The results of the mapping confirm the thickness of each layer and distribution of elements. The simulation of optical constants (n and k values) are carried out by CODE software, the results of which indicate that the n and k values decrease from substrate to surface. Neutral salt spray test is preformed to measure the ability of anti-corrosion, which indicates the coating has a good optical performance in 3.5% NaCl solution for 24 h.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) graphene-reinforced structural materials with excellent solar-thermal conversion, mechanical and thermal transfer properties present attractive prospects for the fabrication of high-performance composite phase change materials (PCMs). Herein, multifunctional 3D continuous sponge frameworks wrapping with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are facilely prepared via simply circular impregnation and in-suit reduction process. Further, the stable combination of 3D support material and phase change matrix through vacuum melting infiltration can successfully obtain the rGO@sponge framework/paraffin wax (rGO@SF/PW) composite shape-stabilized PCMs. As an advanced energy conversion and storage PCMs, the rGO@SF/PW achieves efficient solar-thermal conversion effciency of 85%, excellent energy storage properties (phase-change enthalpy of 170.4 J/g for the loading amount of 90 wt%), high thermal transfer performance and good cycling thermal stability. Based on the comprehensive performances of the rGO@SF/PW, domestic storage systems for solar-thermal water are designed to broaden the application of PCMs in the solar-thermal energy area.

Abstract: This work aims to unveil the optimal annealing conditions and surface treatments of CZGeSe absorbers, synthesized using vacuum-based deposition technique, with an eye to optimizing the main parameters allowing better control of secondary phases formation and improving crystalline quality of this absorber. Firstly, a comparative study is given of one and two-step annealing profiles, where, for each thermal treatment, the optimal temperature is probed. The second section of this study underlines the evaluation of the surface treatment effect on the as-annealed absorber using different etching agents. Finally, the effect of different post-annealing treatment temperatures on the overall performance of the fabricated devices is evaluated. For the studied optimizations, a deep understanding of the cell behavior is provided through structural, morphological and electrical characterizations. Preliminary results have given an efficiency up to 5.6% with higher Voc = 572 mV and FF = 65% compared to the reported record cell using similar absorber (Voc = 558 mV, FF = 59%). This performance is linked to the implementation of a two-step annealing process with lower temperatures (330 °C/480 °C) as it showed the best crystallinity-efficiency trade-off along with the smallest amount of ZnSe secondary phase among all the thermal routines studied. In addition, after the evaluation of several etching agents, the implementation of a KCN etching has shown to be the most effective leading to a remarkable improvement of the PN junction through a surface passivation.

Abstract: An ultrathin (<~0.5 nm) ZnS interfacial passivation layer (IPL) was produced by atomic layer deposition in order to improve the performance of CdS quantum-dot (QD) sensitized solar cells. The mutable role of the top ZnS IPL, deposited after QD sensitization, enhanced light absorbance by acting as an anti-reflective coating resulting in increased photocurrent. The bottom ZnS IPL deposited on the TiO2 photoanode before QD sensitization led to a uniform distribution of smaller-sized QD microaggregates by modification of the surface energy of TiO2, which improved the photo-generated charge carrier injection from QD to TiO2. Furthermore, both ZnS IPLs have roles as the recombination barrier layer. Consequently, the photoconversion efficiency was enhanced by approximately 15% and 30% in cells with top and bottom ZnS IPLs, respectively.

Abstract: A vital part of poly-Si passivating contacts is the ultrathin interfacial oxide layer sandwiched between heavily-doped poly-Si and c-Si absorber that will herein be investigated in detail. The stoichiometry of differently prepared interfacial oxides in the as-grown state was investigated by XPS. The findings are correlated with the thermal stability of the oxide layers integrated in tunnel-oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) which experience further structural modification during the high-temperature annealing step. More specifically, it was observed that a more stoichiometric interfacial oxide is a more effective diffusion barrier for dopants and, thereby enhanced the thermal stability of TOPCon structures with respect to the passivation quality. Furthermore, stoichiometric changes in the oxide layer upon subsequent contact formation (thermal annealing) were analyzed by XPS after selective etch back of the doped poly-Si layer. It is found that the interfacial oxide becomes more stoichiometric during annealing. In addition, a slight increase in oxide thickness was observed which tentatively could be explained by a large amount of unbound interstitial oxygen in the interface region.

Abstract: This paper presents a colloidal binary composite phase change storage material prepared using inorganic–organic phase-change materials (PCMs) to improve the thermal conductivity of the organic PCM and solve the supercooling and phase separation problems associated with inorganic PCMs. Samples of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD)/capric acid (CA) were prepared using a sol-gel method. These samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal conductivity analyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). First, the eutectic mixture ratio for a DHPD-CA binary system was theoretically predicted. An analysis of the DSC curve and the two-phase diagram of the eutectic system reveals that the colloidal mixture is close to the eutectic state when the DHPD/CA ratio is 7:3. The results of FTIR spectroscopy and XRD revealed that DHPD and CA in the colloidal mixture did not undergo a chemical reaction, indicating the occurrence of physical mixing. Second, the melting temperature of the composite material was 33.8 °C, the degree of supercooling was 0.9 °C, the melting enthalpy of phase change was 168.8 J g−1, and the thermal conductivity was 0.468 W m−1K−1 at 15 °C. Moreover, after 300 accelerated cold–hot cycles, the thermal properties and morphology of the colloidal binary composite were stable. The addition of CA reduced the degree of supercooling of the DHPD. Furthermore, the addition of DHPD improved the phase-change latent heat and thermal conductivity of CA, thereby reducing the cost of the composite material. The material presented can be used in passive solar energy applications.

Abstract: Different from the opaque conventional types, transparent solar cells (TSCs) have the great advantage of generating energy without blocking of human vision. And thus, this invisible power generator can be applied to cell phone screens, displays and windows of vehicles and buildings. The electric power conversion from UV absorption spontaneously removes the UV-induced damage on skin and eyes. All transparent solar cells were achieved by solid-state method. This dry-process ensures the long-term working device stability without any complex packaging processes of wet-type solar cells. Large-scale available sputtering was applied to deposit inorganic metal oxide layers. The sequential formation of p-NiO/n-TiO2 spontaneously forms the heterojunction and simultaneously drives the transparent photovoltaic cell. Apparently, the extension of light utilization of transparent solar cells is highly desirable to improve the performances, without scarifying transmittance at the same time. In order to tune TiO2 light response, the self-doped Ti3+ chemical state is formed which supports the transition of electrons, photo-generated by longer wavelength lights. The NiO/TiO2 TSC produces the highest photovoltage of 600 mV for UV light and also utilizes the longest wavelength of 740 nm. The TSC produced the photovoltage of 153.9 mV and photocurrent of 0.4 mA under the natural Sun light and can move a fan (0.3V and 2.5 mA) under LED light. The TSC would be an invisible power generator by supplying energy for human-electronics.

Abstract: A perfect spectrally selective solar absorber based on dielectric filled fishnet-shape tungsten grating has been proposed and numerically investigated. The designed structure achieves a total solar absorption efficiency higher than 94% and a total emittance less than 5% at 100 °C, resulting in a total photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4% irradiated by one sun. In addition, the proposed selective solar absorber exhibits nearly perfect absorption in visible and near-infrared regions (400–1200 nm), and the underlying physical mechanisms for the excellent performance including the impedance matching with surrounding medium, surface plasmon resonances, and cavity resonances are elucidated in detail. Furthermore, effects of the proposed solar absorber geometric parameters on the absorption properties of it are also analyzed. Moreover, the solar absorber exhibits angular independence up to 60° and polarization insensitivity. The proposed spectrally selective solar absorber promises potentially valuable applications for thermophotovoltaic conversion, thermal emitters, solar energy harvesting, and so on.

Abstract: By integrating CdSeTe alloy into CdTe based thin-film solar cells, high efficiency above 19% has been obtained. However, the role of O2 during the CdSeTe deposition has not been studied since the current reported CdSeTe deposition process by close space sublimation (CSS) is free of oxygen. We found the oxygen performed an important role in this process. Here, we prepared CdSeTe films under O2/N2 ambient and apply them as absorb-layer together with CdTe. The effects of O2 on the CdSeTe deposition, material performance, and devices have been studied. Oxygen in the ambient can increase Se content in the CdSeTe alloy for the as-deposited films. A two-step reaction process of “oxidation - sublimation” is proposed to explain the role of oxygen. The oxygen facilitates the amount of Se content into the vapor then in the film. With the oxygen appearance, the composition of as-deposited CdSeTe films and the source can be controlled relative stable. This technique makes the process of depositing CdSeTe thin film by CSS for long time operation feasible. The short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the cells are promoted with the introduce of oxygen. A process of high efficiency (Eff.) (≥19%) CdSeTe/CdTe cells with oxygen in the CSS deposition is developed, which is repeatable and also compatible with both the existing manufacturing and laboratory CdTe process and equipment.

Abstract: CsPbI2Br is one of candidates of the top layer for the all perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the perovskite is prone to change the phase from α (black) to δ (yellow) type. In this research, Cs1-xFAxPbI2Br perovskites were fabricated in an ambient atmosphere, and their properties immediately after the fabrication and the phase stability were investigated. The quality of the perovskite films was enhanced and the trap density was reduced after the incorporation of the FA cations. The phase stability of the Cs1-xFAxPbI2Br perovskite was effectively enhanced. Consequently, the highest power conversion efficiency of 12.28% with open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V, current intensity (Jsc) of 15.65 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 72% in the planar solar cell based on Cs0.7FA0.3PbI2Br perovskite is reported. The bandgap was optimized to be about 1.82 eV suitable for all perovskite tandem top layer. Most importantly, all the photovoltaic parameters of Cs0.7FA0.3PbI2Br perovskite solar cells showed ignorable decay after 2 months’ measurement in an ambient atmosphere with the presence of air and humidity without encapsulation.

Abstract: NaCl–CaCl2–MgCl2 ternary molten salt is a potential material for thermal transfer and storage applications at high temperatures. In the present work, its microstructures and thermophysical properties over a wide operating temperature range were investigated by using ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. An approach-to-equilibrium molecular dynamics method was used to calculate the thermal conductivity of molten salts. The local coordination structures and mechanisms of their temperature dependence were investigated. It can be found that the dominant bonding interactions are between cation-chlorine ion pairs, which can be considered as bridges connecting the local structures in liquids. The interaction between ions decreases with the increase of temperature as distances of ion clusters get larger. The thermophysical properties were evaluated in detail from 703 to 1173 K, showing a good accordance with the experimental data. A detailed relationship between operating temperature, microstructure, and thermophysical properties has been studied. The results suggest that the changes in thermodynamic properties with increasing temperature are caused by the variations of microstructures, in terms of the distances and bonding characteristics of ions.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) affect DNA repair pathways by modulating multiple cellular machineries, including chromatin state, DNA repair factor modification, and the cell cycle. These machineries can differentially affect DNA repair outcomes. With the aim to investigate the impacts of HDACis on DNA repair following CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage from the mixed actions, we used two pan-HDACis, trichostatin A (TSA) and PCI-24781, to treat animal immortalized and primary cells, and studied CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing results by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. We first found that TSA and PCI-24781 increased NHEJ efficiency. However, further analysis of the total NHEJ events demonstrated that alternative end joining (alt-EJ) mainly contributed to the enhanced total NHEJ by HDACis. We then analyzed HDR efficiency with HDACi treatment and found that multiple HDR pathways, including homologous recombination, single strand annealing and single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN)-mediated HDR, were all increased with HDACi treatment. TSA also increased CRISPR-induced ssODN-mediated HDR rate in pig parthenogenetic embryos. Analyzing acetylation status of DNA repair factors showed that acetylation levels of classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) factors KU70 and KU80 and alt-EJ factor PARP1 were significantly enhanced, but alt-EJ factor LIG3 and HDR factors Rad51 and Rad52 were not affected greatly, implying a differential impact on these repair pathways by HDACis. In addition, TSA and PCI-24781 can enrich cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle which is beneficial for occurrence of HDR. These findings show that HDACis can effectively promote CRISPR-mediated homology-involved DNA repair, including HDR and alt-EJ pathways, through concerted action of multiple cellular machineries.

Abstract: Sepiolite (Sep) and exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) were applied as supporting material and thermal conductive fillers to solve the problems of possible leakage, low thermal conductivity and high supercooling of m-erythritol (ME) as a phase change material (PCM). The loading of ME in the ME/Sep form-stable PCMs could attain 56 wt% when the Sep was treated by 2.5 M HCl and heated at 800 °C for 1 h. The form-stable PCMs were basically physical mixtures though there were some interactions occurred between the hydroxyl groups of ME and Sep. The thermal stability of ME was improved after it was confined in the supporting materials. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the ME/Sep/xGnP form-stable PCM containing 56% ME and 8.0 wt% xGnP could be enhanced to 0.756 W/mK, which was 103% higher than the corresponding ME/Sep form-stable PCM. Moreover, the transient temperature response of the form-stable PCMs was greatly improved by Sep and xGnP. Furthermore, the supercooling of ME could be decreased from 80 °C for pure ME to about 30 °C in the ME/Sep/xGnP form-stable PCM containing 56% ME and 8.0 wt% xGnP. Besides, the latent heat recovery ratio of the ME/Sep/xGnP form-stable PCMs were also greatly improved.

Abstract: The use of controlled inert ambient to produce hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them less competitive towards the commercialization. Herein, progress is made with the preparation of hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) in a high relative humidity (RH ~ 60%) ambient condition by using a mixture of ethyl acetate (EA) and 4-Tertbutyl-Pyridine (tBP) as anti-solvent. A small amount of tBP helps to form a more homogeneous perovskite surface with a higher hydrophobicity. The mixture of EA and tBP is found to be an efficient anti-solvent to extract the primary solvent and moisture in the precursor solution and form mirror-like perovskite thin films. More than 200 perovskite solar cells, with active area of 0.1 cm2, were prepared with the perovskite thin films prepared under ambient conditions. It is showed that a small amount of tBP in EA improves consistently all the photovoltaic parameters of our PSCS, from an average efficiency of 8.64% over 113 cells with only EA as anti-solvent to 13.64% over 131 cells with EA + tBP as the anti-solvent. More than 55% of the last ones show efficiencies higher than 16%. The champion cell, recording an efficiency of 17.41% in the beginning and reaching the maximum efficiency of 18.04%, remains more than 80% of the initial efficiency after more than 180 days of storage in ambient conditions without encapsulation. The proposed method opens the possibility to fabricate highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells under ambient condition without glove box.

Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with high morbidity and mortality rates. In spite of numerous advancements have been made in therapeutic methods, the prognosis of HNSCC patients remains poor. Therefore, investigation of crucial genes during HNSCC tumorigenesis which could be exploited as biomarkers and therapeutic targets is greatly needed. In this study, original data of four independent datasets was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and analyzed through R language to screen out differentially expressed genes. Paired like homeodomain 1 and SAM and SH3 domain-containing 1 were selected to be further explored through multiple online databases. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry assay were adopted to validate the downregulation of paired like homeodomain 1 and SAM and SH3 domain-containing 1 in HNSCC and statistical analysis indicated their close associations with patient prognosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated the inhibitory effect of paired like homeodomain 1 and SAM and SH3 domain-containing 1 on HNSCC progression. Overall, we identified the aberrant downregulation of paired like homeodomain 1 and SAM and SH3 domain-containing 1 in HNSCC and suggested the potential of utilizing them as therapeutic targets or efficient biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Our findings may provide novel evidences for the development of new strategies for HNSCC treatment.

Abstract: Laser power converters (LPCs) based on InxGa1-xAs/GaAs metamorphic heterostructure grown by MOVPE have been investigated. Both direct study of transmission electron microscopy images and analysis of the dark I–V curves at a low photogenerated current have shown the absence of the effect of threading dislocations from the metamorphic buffer on the LPC parameters. It has been shown, according to the “voltage” and “current” invariants that voltage loss in all investigated LPCs evidences the good quality of p-n junctions for the operating mode of high power laser radiation conversion. It has been also demonstrated that the method of saturation current approximation with current invariant allows obtaining the limit voltage losses irrespective of photogenerated current. Band-gap and thickness of the InGaAs LPCs have been adjusted using spectral characteristics. Fundamental losses (thermal and resistive) and ways to minimize them have been discussed. As a result, LPCs based on In0.23Ga0.77As have demonstrated the laser conversion efficiency (λ = 1064 nm) of more than 50% with maintaining the efficiency of more than 48% up to 13 W/cm2.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is characterised by excessive scarring in the lung which leads to compromised lung function, serious breathing problems and in some diseases, death. It includes several lung disorders with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) the most common and most severe. Pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be perpetuated by aberrant wound healing which leads to fibroblast accumulation, differentiation and activation, and deposition of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in particular, collagen. Recent studies have identified the importance of changes in the composition and structure of lung ECM during the development of pulmonary fibrosis and the interaction between ECM and lung cells. There is strong evidence that increased matrix stiffness induces changes in cell function including proliferation, migration, differentiation and activation. Understanding how changes in the ECM microenvironment influence cell behaviour during fibrogenesis, and the mechanisms regulating these changes, will provide insight for developing new treatments.

Abstract: Since the discovery of the photovoltaic (PV) effect in the 19th century, various PV windows have been developed to improve the energy performance of a building and expand the supply of renewable energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted attention as promising alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells because of their transparency and aesthetic value. This study aims to analyze the effect of DSSC windows on the building environment and energy performance and build a database to help architects select appropriate DSSC windows for future zero-energy buildings (ZEBs). We use DesignBuilder, a building energy analysis program, to evaluate indoor illuminance, indoor temperature, cooling and heating energy, lighting energy, and power generation. Our prototype DSSC windows exhibit an improved heat transmission rate (i.e., U-value) but lower visible-light transmission (VLT) than low-emissivity glazing windows; thus, they decrease the heating energy and increase the cooling and lighting energy. We predict that DSSC windows meeting the criteria of 13% power conversion efficiency (PCE) and 30% VLT will achieve energy savings of 4861.44 kWh/yr. PV windows with over 50% VLT with any PCE can be beneficial to net zero-energy and net energy-plus buildings.

Abstract: In this study, a heat transfer self-enhancement mechanism in novel composite phase change materials (CPCMs) was proposed and realized. The study aimed to develop aluminium ammonium sulfate dodecahydrate (NH4Al(SO4)2·12H2O, AASD) based novel CPCMs for thermal energy storage. A melting/solidification experiment with 2 modes and a comprehensive evaluation method were established to analyze the influence of various additives and thermal cycles on the heat storage/release performance of AASD based CPCMs. Thermal properties, chemical compatibility, thermal reliability and stability of the CPCMs with relatively low undercooling were further investigated. It was shown that the optimum formulations of the CPCMs were 97 wt% AASD/2 wt% XG/1 wt% APSD and 97 wt% AASD/2 wt% XG/1 wt% CCD (novel CPCMs). The adverse effect of 2 wt% XG on the heat storage efficiency of CPCMs could be eliminated spontaneously during the process of thermal cycles. The suitable melting temperature (MSE mode 1: 92.1–93.5 °C; MSE mode 2: 92.3–93.1 °C)/crystallization temperature (MSE mode 1: 60.2–80.5 °C; MSE mode 2: 59.0–77.3 °C) and high latent heat (187.2–255.5 J/g, 210 thermal cycles) enable the novel CPCMs with simple preparation method to be up-and-coming candidates for thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Degradation of the encapsulation of solar modules is a crucial problem and, accordingly, tools for assessing and understanding the according degradation is an important research topic. Here, we suggest near-infrared absorption spectroscopy (NIRA) as a tool that has a strong potential to determine non-invasively the composition of encapsulant and backsheet in typical commercial solar modules. Correct polymer identification by NIRA was supported by Raman spectral microscopy of the backsheet air sides and cross sections, with a hundred solar modules of different manufacturers analyzed by both spectroscopic methods. Furthermore, a specific NIRA measurement regime of the ethylene vinyl acetate encapsulant is presented, which potentially allows to probe the composition of the encapsulant non-destructively under lab conditions but also on silicon solar modules in the field installed outdoors. The present report shows NIRA to be a powerful method for non-destructive analysis of backsheets and encapsulants of photovoltaic silicon modules.

Abstract: In this research work, MXene with a chemical formula of Ti3C2 is synthesized using wet chemistry method and suspended in pure olein palm oil (OPO) to formulate a new class of heat transfer fluid to investigate its thermal and energy performance in a hybrid PV/T solar thermal system numerically using COMSOL Multiphysics. In addition to this research work, Al2O3-water based nanofluid is compared with MXene-OPO nanofluid in the hybrid PV/T solar thermal system. The MXene-OPO nanofluid is prepared with a loading concentration of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.2 wt %. MXene-OPO nanofluid with 0.2 wt % loading concentration exhibit 68.5% higher thermal conductivity than the pure OPO at 25 °C. The highest viscosity reduction is found by 61% when the temperature is raised from 25 °C to 50 °C for nanofluid with 0.2 wt % of MXene. Compared to PVT with Al2O3-water based nanofluid, MXene based nanofluid display about 16% higher thermal efficiency improvement at 0.07 kg/s flow rate. About 9% heat transfer coefficient improvement is found for the PVT with MXene nanofluids compared to PVT with Al2O3-water heat transfer fluid. MXene nanofluid may reduce PV temperature by 40% compared to stand alone PV module.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a passivating hole-selective tunnel contact on crystalline silicon (Si) based on an ultrathin thermal SiO2 and a (sub-)monolayer thick aluminum oxide (AlOx) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with 1 to 7 cycles. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is essential to activate the passivation and intense visible light is demonstrated to play a key role in the formation and occupation of the Al-induced acceptor states in SiO2 that provide the passivation. This simple stack provides very good surface passivation on n-type Si with a surface saturation current density as low as J0s = 25 fA/cm2 (Seff = 2.7 cm/s) and a contact resistivity ρc of ~200 mΩ cm2, while being Si-dopant-free, fully transparent and firing-stable. The Al-deposition on thermal SiO2 during the initial ALD-cycles is studied carefully by synchrotron-based reference-free grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (GIXRF). Different metallization and capping approaches are tested and discussed.

Abstract: Identifying co-expression of lipid species is challenging, but indispensable to identify novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Lipid metabolism is often dysregulated in cancer cells, and changes in lipid metabolism affect cellular processes such as proliferation, autophagy, and tumor development. In addition to mRNA analysis of sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes, we performed liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis in three breast cancer cell lines. These breast cancer cell lines differ in estrogen receptor and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 status. Our data show that sphingolipids and non-sphingolipids are strongly increased in SKBr3 cells. SKBr3 cells are estrogen receptor negative and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 positive. Treatment with G15, a G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 antagonist, abolishes the effect of increased sphingolipid and non-sphingolipid levels in SKBr3 cells. In particular, ether lipids are expressed at much higher levels in cancer compared to normal cells and are strongly increased in SKBr3 cells. Our analysis reveals that this is accompanied by increased sphingolipid levels such as ceramide, sphingadiene-ceramide and sphingomyelin. This shows the importance of focusing on more than one lipid class when investigating molecular mechanisms in breast cancer cells. Our analysis allows unbiased screening for different lipid classes leading to identification of co-expression patterns of lipids in the context of breast cancer. Co-expression of different lipid classes could influence tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells. Identification of co-regulated lipid species is important to achieve improved breast cancer treatment outcome.

Abstract: A combined photovoltaic (PV) cell and thermoelectric (TE) device can effectively expand the utilization of the solar spectrum, and it has been confirmed that effective heat transfer can improve the performance of PV-TE hybrid devices. In this study, a series of novel integrated PV-TE hybrid devices with enhanced heat transfer capabilities have been manufactured by removing the upper ceramic plate of conventional TE devices. An insulating layer was deposited on the back of the PV cell to avoid an electrical connection between the PV cell and the TE device. An exhaustive experimental study has been conducted on the integrated PV-TE hybrid device, using a system that includes a solar simulator and cooling equipment. Experimental results indicate that the integrated hybrid design can improve the electrical output of the PV cell. In addition, thermal greases with different thermal conductivities are used to decrease the thermal resistance between the PV cell and TE device. The use of the thermal lubricant significantly improves the performance of the integrated PV-TE hybrid device by enhancing the heat dissipation of the PV cell, and the heat absorption of the hot side of TE device. The thickness of the insulating layer may be controlled with the use of different application times, and this has been demonstrated. Experimental results show that a thinner insulating layer can increase heat transfer significantly and improve the performance of the integrated PV-TE hybrid device. Consequently, the design utilizes a more compatible and efficient integrated couple involving a PV cell and TE device.

Abstract: Due to Silicon (Si) material abundance and lower cost, integration of high efficiency III-V solar cells on Si substrates is of major importance for future solar energy harvesting devices. In this paper, we report on the growth optimization with a detailed characterization of epitaxial growth of crystalline GaAs on porous silicon layers (PSL), and demonstration of single-junction GaAs solar cell on PSL performances. GaAs deposition is performed on engineered porous Si surfaces with different growth temperatures. One and two-steps growth (TSG) were also investigated. X-ray diffraction demonstrated almost one order of magnitude lower threading dislocation density (TDD) of 2× 108 cm-2 for TSG process of GaAs on PSL compared to the one-step growth. Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that a reduction of growth temperature leads to surface morphology improvement. A single junction GaAs solar cell heterostructure grown by TSG and fabricated atop the porous layer, demonstrated higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) when compared to an identical structure grown on crystalline Si (c-Si).

Abstract: Numerous studies have been published regarding outcomes of cancer patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, most of these are single-center studies with a limited number of patients. To better assess the outcomes of this new infection in this subgroup of susceptible patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on cancer patients. We performed a literature search using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies that reported the risk of infection and complications of COVID-19 in cancer patients and retrieved 22 studies (1018 cancer patients). The analysis showed that the frequency of cancer among patients with confirmed COVID-19 was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3) in the overall cohort. These patients had a mortality of 21.1% (95% CI: 14.7–27.6), severe/critical disease rate of 45.4% (95% CI: 37.4–53.3), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate of 14.5% (95% CI: 8.5–20.4), and mechanical ventilation rate of 11.7% (95% CI: 5.5–18). The double-arm analysis showed that cancer patients had a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.71–6.13), severe/critical disease (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.70–5.67), ICU admission (OR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.85–5.17), and mechanical ventilation (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.27–18.65) than non-cancer patients. Furthermore, cancer patients had significantly lower platelet levels and higher D-dimer levels, C-reactive protein levels, and prothrombin time. In conclusion, these results indicate that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection-related complications. Therefore, cancer patients need diligent preventive care measures and aggressive surveillance for earlier detection of COVID-19 infection.

Abstract: CZTSeS absorbers were prepared by two-step annealing under Ar carried H2Se gas, namely, annealing holding at 400 °C then at 560 °C. The additional holding results in a more compact morphology, same microstructure of phases and higher emission energy of CZTSeS absorbers. The FF as high as 79% has been achieved by improving Rsh, together with the contributions of Rs as low as 0.1 Ω·cm2 and a ohmic contact. This work highlights great potential for sputtering processing based on quaternary target and demonstrates that fill factor of 79% can be experimentally achieved in CZTSeS solar cells.

Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were employed as the additive to make composites of erythritol, a promising medium-temperature PCM candidate. GO nanosheets modified with hydroxyl groups were applied to improve the dispersion stability of the composites. A systematic characterization on the latent heat storage performance was performed for both pure and composite erythritol, in order to identify the benefits and challenges of the composites. It was found that the thermal conductivity is increased by nearly twice and the degree of supercooling was lowered from ~64 °C to ~48 °C at the loading of 1.0 wt% GO nanosheets (the maximum loading tested). The addition of GO nanosheets also leads to an increase of the retrievable latent heat during crystallization, from ~187 kJ/kg to ~225 kJ/kg at the same loading, by increasing the crystallinity. However, the introduction of GO nanosheets can also lead to a rise in the dynamic viscosity of erythritol. As a result, the crystallization rate is slowed down and accordingly, the duration of crystallization becomes 62% longer when the loading reaches 1.0 wt%. In addition, favorable dispersion stability of the erythritol composites is observed, and their melting point (~117 °C) remains almost unchanged during 50 melting-crystallization cycles. Functionalized GO nanosheets have been shown to be an efficient additive for improving the performance of erythritol, but a trade-off analysis on the loading would be required to achieve the best overall performance.

Abstract: Nitrate salts have been applied as heat transfer and heat storage medium in the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. Corrosion is critical to the long-time safe operation of the CSP system. This experimental study was conducted to research the dynamic corrosion behaviors of 316 L stainless steel in high-temperature quaternary nitrate nitrite mixture. The effects of corrosion on 316 L stainless steel were investigated under the varied flow rates of 0.6 m/s, 1.3 m/s and 2 m/s with 565 °C constant temperature for 1000 h. The results showed that oxidation corrosion occurred in 316 L stainless steel at all working conditions. The dynamic corrosion curves were parabolic, and the value corrosion weight loss (mmass) increased with the increase of the flow rate. Meantime, when the products flow rates were 0.6 m/s, 1.3 m/s and 2 m/s, the values of mmass were 3.6 mg cm−2, 3.77 mg cm−2 and 4.36 mg cm−2. The values of corrosion depth (Rdepths) were 0.039 mm/a, 0.041 mm/a and 0.048 mm/a, respectively. Besides, the corrosion products were consisted of hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), trace amounts of MgFe2O4 and NaFeO2 with the structure of lamellar. Furthermore, the corrosion products gradually transformed into FeCr2O4 with structures of dense and massive, and the increase of the flow rate deepened the degree of corrosion, but it had little effect on the types of corrosion products.

β-arrestin1 inhibits hypoxic injury-induced autophagy in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells via the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway,

Abstract: Autophagy has been greatly implicated in injured endothelial cells during pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). β-arrestin1, a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein, has attracted considerable attention as an essential protective factor in PAH. However, its role in autophagy of injured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the potential effects of β-arrestin1 on autophagy and apoptosis in human PAECs (hPAECs) under hypoxic stress. Hypoxic stimuli increases autophagy and decreases the level of β-arrestin1 in hPAECs. Furthermore, pathologic changes, namely increased proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance, are observed after hypoxia exposure. These are reversed after β-arrestin1 overexpression (β-arrestin1-OV) or treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Finally, β-arrestin1 suppresses the increase in autophagy and apoptosis resistance of hypoxic hPAECs. Mechanistically, β-arrestin1 upregulates the activity of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and downregulates the expression of BNIP3 and Nix after hypoxic stress. Collectively, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that β-arrestin1 reduces excessive autophagy and apoptosis resistance by activating the Akt/mTOR axis in hypoxic hPAECs. This knowledge suggests a promising therapeutic target for PAH.

Abstract: Hybrid structures combining a photo-active material and non noble metal oxide co-catalyst nanoparticles are of strong interest to produce efficient photoelectrodes for hydrogen production while limiting the cost due to noble metals (Pt, Ru …). In order to get some insight on the mechanism change induced by such co-catalyst nanoparticles (NPs), we conducted a comparative study between cobalt and nickel oxide nanoparticles deposited onto TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) prepared through anodization. The TiO2-NTs were decorated with CoO and NiO nanoparticles using the reactive pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The oxygen atmosphere used during the PLD process, ensures the in-situ oxidation of the metal nanoparticles into CoO and NiO. The surface loadings of CoO or NiO NPs were controlled by the number of laser ablation pulses (NLP). The efficiency of CoO and NiO NPs as co-catalysts for photo-electrochemical water splitting was studied by cyclic voltammetry, as a function of NLP, under both simulated sunlight and visible light illuminations and by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. We determined an optimal catalyst loading at NLP = 2000, allowing to almost triple the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) for both TiO2-NTs/CoO-NPs and TiO2-NTs/NiO-NPs nanohybrid photoanodes, in comparison with bare TiO2-NTs. Moreover, CoO-NPs were found to be the best co-catalyst under visible light illumination, with a PCE almost 10 times higher than for TiO2. This significant enhancement of the visible light activity is ascribed to the narrower band gap of CoO and to the formation of a heterojunction with TiO2 that is more favorable for charge transfer than in the case of NiO co-catalyst.

Abstract: Objective
In sepsis, the protection of the vascular endothelium is essential and the maintenance of its function is critical to prevent further deterioration. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid in plasma and its role in sepsis has not been extensively studied. This study aimed to investigate the effects of HDL-S1P on sepsis in cellular and animal models, as well as human plasma samples.
Measurements
We established an animal model of sepsis with different severities achieved by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, and then explored the relationship between HDL-S1P and lung endothelial dysfunction in vivo. To determine the effects of HDL-S1P in the pulmonary endothelium of septic rats, we then injected HDL-S1P into septic rats to find out if it can reduce the lung injury caused by sepsis. Further, we explored the mechanism in vitro by studying the role of S1P-specific receptor agonists and inhibitors in LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We also explored the relationship between plasma HDL-S1P content and sepsis severity in septic patients by analysing their plasma samples.
Results
HDL-S1P concentrations in plasma were negatively correlated with endothelial functional damage in sepsis, both in the animal model and in the septic patients in our study. In vivo, HDL-S1P injection significantly reduced pulmonary oedema and endothelial leakage in septic rats. In vitro, cell experiments showed that HDL-S1P effectively protected the proliferation and migration abilities of endothelial cells, which could be partly explained by its biased activation of the S1P receptor 1.
Conclusion
Our study preliminary explored the function of HDL-S1P in sepsis in cellular and animal models, as well as human subjects. The results indicate HDL-S1P protected endothelial functions in septic patients. Thus, it has therapeutic potential and can be used for the clinical treatment of sepsis.

Abstract: Molten salt is considered to be a significant medium of thermal energy storage (TES) used for concentrating solar power (CSP). Reasonably improving its thermophysical properties can realize the efficient utilization of solar energy. To investigate the effect of nanoparticle-doped molten salt, adding two size nano-alumina (NA, NA1 and NA2) with different content to solar salt (SS, with 60:40 ratio) by high temperature melting method. The using temperature zone had been broadened. For the same system, the specific heat (cp) of the solid was higher than that of the liquid. The maximum cp values in liquid of both systems appeared at the NA content of 0.5 wt%, corresponding to 1.71 J g−1K−1 and 1.84 J g−1K−1, respectively, which increased by 9.62% and 17.95% compared with the pure SS. Due to the high specific surface areas of NA1 and NA2, which were 151.3 m2 g−1 and 177.04 m2 g−1, respectively. And the higher surface tension (γ) of NA2-SS, which had a higher surface energy to improve the cp nanocomposites. The thermal conductivity (λ) increased with the content of NAs, increasing by 2.27% and 4.28%, respectively when the content of two NAs was 0.5 wt%. The content of NAs had little effect on viscosity (η). As a nitrate-based nanocomposite thermal storage material, it has great application prospects in TES, owing to its high cp and λ, widened operating temperature range and reliability.

Abstract: Background
Thrombocytopenia remains a life-threatening late complication of HCT with an incidence of 5–20%. Currently, there is no approved drug for the treatment of persistent thrombocytopenia post HCT and platelet transfusion is the maintain stay of treatment. Eltrombopag is approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with different diseases, however; data on eltrombopag treatment post HCT are limited.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating the effect of eltrombopag on platelet recovery in patients with persistent thrombocytopenia post HCT. The primary endpoint was platelet recovery to ≥ 20,000/μL for 7 consecutive days without transfusion support after starting eltrombopag. Secondary endpoint was platelet recovery to ≥ 50,000/μL for 7 consecutive days.
Results
Twenty-one patients were included. Twelve (75%) of 16 patients became independent from platelet transfusions. Median time from starting eltrombopag to last transfusion was 60 days (range, 9–226 days). Ten (63%) of 16 transfusion dependent patients with platelet count < 20,000/μL achieved the primary endpoint. Seven (33%) patients of 21 included had successful platelet recovery (ie, ≥50,000/μL without transfusion support) and the median time to platelet recovery in patients who achieved it was 32 days (range, 13–265 days). Ten patients (48%) were able to successfully discontinue eltrombopag without recurrence of thrombocytopenia.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrated that eltrombopag appears to have a clinically significant impact on platelet recovery in persistent thrombocytopenic patients post HCT.

Abstract: Herein, new hybrid thermochemical materials (TCMs) combining MgSO4, MgCl2, and their mixture incorporated into the graphene matrix have been prepared for low to medium temperature heat storage applications. These new hybrid materials were developed to solve agglomeration, cyclability and corrosion issues during hydration/dehydration cycles. The preliminary results of X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the inorganic salts were successfully impregnated into the matrix without providing undesirable reactions. Calorimetric analysis (DSC-TGA) revealed a significant improvement of cycling stability up to 60 hydration/dehydration cycles, and an excellent storage density of 1194.3 J/g and 890 J/g was reached for MgSO4 and MgCl2 composites respectively. In order to protect the heat exchanger metal from the TCMs behaviour, two coating films of polyurethane and polyurethane-graphene have been applied. The scanning electron microscopy showed the good dispersion of graphene into polyurethane film. The electrochemical measurements under storage reactor conditions were examined using conventional methods such as gravimetric tests, polarization techniques and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). An inhibition efficiency up to ≈99% for coated metal was reached and suitable corrosion mechanism for uncoated and coated copper was proposed.

Abstract: We report on the fabrication of fully screen-printed bifacial large area (239 cm2) high-efficiency n-type Si solar cells with ion-implanted homogeneous boron emitter on the front side and carrier-selective tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) on the rear. Our phosphorus-doped poly-Si/SiOx passivated contact with SiNx capping layer gave excellent surface passivation with a very low recombination current density (J0_TOPCon) of ~1 fA/cm2 after a simulated firing treatment at ~770 °C without metallization. After screen-printed and fire-through metallization on n-TOPCon with ~13% metal coverage, metallized J0_TOPCon value increased to only ~5 fA/cm2. In addition, homogenous boron implanted emitter (~180 Ω/) passivated with ALD Al2O3 layer capped with PECVD SiNx/SiOx double-layer antireflection (DLAR) coating gave excellent passivation with emitter recombination current density of ~12 fA/cm2 prior to metallization. The industrial screen-printed, fire-through contacts with floating busbars on this boron emitter gave metallized emitter recombination current density of ~31 fA/cm2. This resulted in a low-cost industrial screen-printed n-type bifacial Si solar cell with 22.6% efficiency and 702 mV open-circuit voltage (Voc).

Abstract: DPP-based conjugated polymers exhibit a broad optical absorption and high motilities for hole and electron, all of which will be advantageous to high photocurrents and good fill factors in OPV. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lag behind other polymer donor materials. In order to understand the reason hindering the PCE improvement, it is especially important to reveal the underlying electronic processes in Donor-Acceptor blending active layer. Through optical pump terahertz probe investigation, we found that the combination of fast exciton separation and long carrier lifetime will convenient to optic-electricity conversion efficiency. Although high charge mobility lead to long carrier lifetime, the difficulty of exciton separation in narrow band gap polymer DPPDTT is a key factor affecting device efficiency.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices (ECDs) displaying multicolor patterns have attracted great interests in a wide range of applications. Considering the complexity in the integration of various EC materials and multi-electrode configurations, the design of multicolor patterned ECDs based on simple approaches remains an elusive goal. Here, we present a self-patterning ECD based on a single layer of multicolor polyaniline (PANI) film. The device demonstrates a novel and simplified three-layer structure including PANI layer, gel electrolyte and conducting layer, which is distinguished from conventional EC devices with typical five layers. Furthermore, a working principle responsible for the self-patterning is proposed based on the horizontal movement and redistribution of anions in PANI layer driven by a current. This unique ionic transport mode contributes to the formation of a multicolor pattern composed of three segments. The dynamic variation of the pattern could be achieved by changing the direction and strength of the current, from which the device exhibits a high transmittance contrast of ~60% at 630 nm, fast response rate (~16 s) and good cycling performance. It is envisioned that this work may provide a new insight to develop self-patterning ECDs for wide applications in information displays, smart fabric and military camouflage.

Abstract: Carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) is a major transcription factor of lipogenesis regulated by glucose status in the liver. However, the function of ChREBP in osteogenic differentiation is unclear. The present study examined the role of ChREBP in osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell line. The mRNA expression of ChREBP, protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit-α (PP2A Cα) and the osteogenic genes such as, DNA-binding protein inhibitor (Id1), runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was measured by qPCR and RT-PCR. Runx2, ChREBP, and PP2A Cα, protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. ALP staining experiment was carried out to evaluate ALP enzyme activity, and a luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze Runx2 transcriptional activity. Expression of ChREBP and PP2A Cα did not change during bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2)-induced osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of ChREBP reduced the osteogenic genes (Runx2 and ALP) expression and ALP activity, while knockdown of ChREBP had the opposite effects. Overexpression of PP2A Cα increased ChREBP expression, while inhibition of PP2A Cα using okadaic acid not only inhibited the expression of ChREBP, but also restored the mRNA and protein expression of Runx2 and activity of ALP enzyme. These results demonstrate that ChREBP inhibits BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation in a PP2A Cα- dependent manner.

Abstract: Silicon solar cells are now less than 3% absolute from the theoretical efficiency limit. Advanced passivated contact architectures have demonstrated surface saturation current densities close to 1 fA/cm2. We have optimized the thin intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layer by controlling the deposition temperature and the silane-to-hydrogen dilution ratio. Thin wafers were used as a testbed to increase the sensitivity to surface passivation. By optimizing the intrinsic layer, we reduced the surface saturation current densities from 1.7 fA/cm2 to 0.6 fA/cm2 on textured wafers with thicknesses ranging between 40 and 180 μm. Implied open-circuit voltages over 760 mV were accomplished on p-i/c-Si/i-n structures deposited on n-type CZ wafers with wafer thicknesses below 50 μm. Further, we demonstrated experimentally the potential of using very thin wafers by manufacturing screen-printed silicon heterojunction solar cells on 40 μm thick standalone wafers while achieving an efficiency of 20.48%.

Abstract: In this study, a new method to reduce the thermomechanical stress in silicon solar cells induced during the cell interconnection process is proposed. By repositioning the rear pads such that the silicon solar cells are bonded to the front copper conductors ended at the same locations as the outer edges of the outermost rear pads along the busbar direction. Finite element modelling predicts that stress reduction of >50% was achieved when solar cells are interconnected by conventional tabbing or Multi-busbars (MBB) and it was confirmed by the derived stress measured by the micro-Raman spectroscopy.

Abstract: Sorafenib resistance is a classic problem related to the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is a recognized need to explore new drug resistance mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome the acquired resistance to sorafenib. Although one study has showed that the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) could sensitize transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, it is unclear whether VPA could reverse resistance to long-term clinical treatment with sorafenib. In this study, we successfully established sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by long-term sorafenib exposure. Compared with sensitive HCC cells, the proliferation, anti-apoptotic capability and migration of the sorafenib-resistant cells were enhanced. In addition, we found that VPA combined with sorafenib could overcome drug resistance by downregulating Jagged2-mediated Notch1 signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Furthermore, the combination of VPA and sorafenib could obviously increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells in vitro and synergistically suppress tumor growth in vivo. These results provided a new insight that the use of VPA in combination with sorafenib was an effective method for clinically solving the problem of sorafenib resistance by modulating the Jagged2-mediated Notch1 signaling pathway and reversing the EMT phenotype.

Abstract: The cell’s resistance to cell death by adhesion loss to extracellular matrix (anoikis), contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Various adhesion molecules are involved in the anoikis resistance, including the syndecan-4 (SDC4), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) present on the cell surface. Changes in the expression of SDC4 have been observed in tumor and transformed cells, indicating its involvement in cancer. In previous works, we demonstrated that acquisition of anoikis resistance resistance by blocking adhesion to the substrate up-regulates syndecan-4 expression in endothelial cells. This study investigates the role of SDC4 in the transformed phenotype of anoikis resistant endothelial cells. Anoikis-resistant endothelial cells (Adh1-EC) were transfected with micro RNA interference (miR RNAi) targeted against syndecan-4. The effect of SDC4 silencing was analyzed by real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. Transfection with miRNA-SDC4 resulted in a sequence-specific decrease in syndecan-4 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the number of heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains in the cell extract and culture medium. The SDC4 silencing led to downregulation of proliferative and invasive capacity and angiogenic abilities of anoikis-resistant endothelial cells. Compared with the parental cells (Adh1-EC), SDC4 silenced cells (SDC4 miR-Syn-4-1-Adh1-EC e miR-Syn-4-2-Adh1-EC) exhibited an increase in adhesion to collagen and laminin and also in the apoptosis rate. Moreover, transfection with miRNA-SDC4 caused a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. This is accompanied by an increase in the heparan sulfate synthesis after 12 h of simulation with fetal calf serum (FCS). SDC4 silencing cells are more dependent of growth factors present in the FCS to synthesize heparan sulfate than parental cells. Similar data were obtained for the wild-type cell line (EC). Our results indicated that downregulation of SDC4 expression reverses the transformed phenotype of anoikis resistant endothelial cells. These and other findings suggest that syndecan-4 is suitable for pharmacological intervention, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: In this paper, composite phase change materials (cPCMs) were prepared by the impregnation method with poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride)-g-octadecanol (PM18) comb-like polymer as PCMs and reduced graphene oxide-carbon nanotubes hybrid aerogel (CG-x) that x (the mass ratio between CNT and GO) varies from 0.5 to 2 as supporting matrix. Thermal properties such as phase change enthalpy, thermal repeatability and shape stabilization of cPCMs were investigated by FTIR, DSC, and thermocouple. PM18@CG-x cPCMs exhibit an enhanced shape-stabilization behavior at 80 °C for 30 min and a 300% increased thermal conductivity is realized. PM18@CG-1 cPCMs demonstrate an excellent light-to-thermal conversion capacity and a good thermal energy storage and release ability, and its largest temperature appears at 75.4 °C under 100 mW/cm2 irradiation intensity. Furthermore, the light-to-thermal conversion capability of fabric controlled by the back-bonded PM18@CG-1 slice is investigated, and the influence of irradiation intensity on thermal energy buffering time is also discussed. Through controlling the number of PM18@CG-1 slices, the tailored thermal properties are further analyzed. This method provides a method to approach the shape-stabilized PCMs with good thermal management and photothermal conversion capability.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices (ECDs) are attracting attention for their simple controllable optical modulation and potential energy saving abilities. When integrated with solar cells self-powering and smart energy management systems may be realized. However, their performance, especially the opaque colored state for privacy protection and energy saving, is still a problem for most devices. Here we demonstrate a vertically integrated approach for preparing cascade electrochromic devices (CECDs) with marked performance compared with ECDs. The cascade strategy allows for devices that simultaneously achieve highly opaque colored states with shorter optical response times, stores comparably higher energy density, whilst protecting the device from electrical cycling degradation associated with high current densities. Furthermore, the adaptive electrochromic energy saving units are integrated, which could be an innovative green energy manage technology and enabling wide applications for smart home and daily or special use.
