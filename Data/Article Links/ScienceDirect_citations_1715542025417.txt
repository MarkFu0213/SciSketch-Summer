Abstract: Insulin triggers glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissues by gaining the available number of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) on the cell surface. GLUT4-loaded vesicles are targeted to plasma membrane from the intracellular reservoir through multiple trafficking and fusion processes that are mainly regulated by Akt. However, it is still largely unknown how GLUT4 expression in the cell surface is promoted by insulin. In the present study, we identified tomosyn at Ser-783 as a possible Akt-substrate motif and examined whether the phosphorylation at Ser-783 is involved in the regulation of GLUT4 expression. Both Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylated the wild-type tomosyn, but not the mutant tomosyn in which Ser-783 was replaced with Ala. Phosphorylation of tomosyn at Ser-783 was also observed in the intact cells by insulin stimulation, which was blocked by PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. In vitro pull-down assay showed that phosphorylation of tomosyn at Ser-783 by Akt inhibited the interaction with syntaxin 4. Insulin stimulation increased GLUT4 in the cell surface of CHO-K1 cells to promote glucose uptake, however exogenous expression of the mutant tomosyn attenuated the increase by insulin. These results suggest that Ser-783 of tomosyn is a target of Akt and is implicated in the interaction with syntaxin 4.

Abstract: Highly-transparent coverglasses coated with broadband and omnidirectional antireflective (AR) moth-eye nanopatterned ultra-violet (UV) curable polymer, i.e., Norland Optical Adhesive (NOA) 63, films are reported. The moth-eye nanopatterns on the NOA63 polymer films/glasses are transferred from the silicon molds with conical nanogratings (NGs) using poly-dimethylsiloxane stamps by a soft imprint lithography technique. For the NOA63 NGs/glasses, surface wetting behaviors, UV radiation/thermal effects, and optical properties, together with theoretical analyses using rigorous coupled-wave analysis calculations, are investigated. For a period of 380nm, the NOA63 NGs/glass exhibits a hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of ~112°. Furthermore, it increases the transmittance of the bare glass over a wide range of wavelengths and incident light angles, showing the higher solar weighted transmittance (TSW) of ~93.2% at an incident angle (θi) of 0° and the larger average TSW value of ~83.6% at θi=10–70° than those (i.e., TSW~90.1% at θi=0° and average TSW value of ~81.5% at θi=10–70°) of the bare glass in the wavelength range of 350–1800nm. In addition, it shows a relatively good stability under intense UV radiation and high temperature. By employing the 380nm-period NG patterned NOA63 films into an AR coating of coverglasses in encapsulated III-V GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar photovoltaic (PV) sub-receiver modules, an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.33% is obtained mainly due to an increased short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.68mA/cm2 compared to reference PV modules with the bare coverglass (i.e., PCE=30.12% and JSC=14.07mA/cm2) at θi=0°. For incident angle-dependent PV module characteristics, it also has more outstanding solar energy conversion properties in a wide θi range of 10–70°.

Abstract: To achieve high conversion efficiencies, advanced silicon solar cell architectures such as interdigitated back contact solar cells demand that defects at both the n+ and p+ doped Si surfaces are passivated simultaneously by a single passivation scheme. In this work, corona charging experiments show that the fixed charge density Qf is a key parameter governing the passivation of both surface types. Alternatively, Qf can be controlled from strongly negative to even positive values by carefully tuning the SiO2 interlayer thickness in SiO2/Al2O3 stacks prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This control in Qf allows for a superior passivation of n+ Si surfaces by SiO2/Al2O3 stacks compared to a single layer Al2O3. For instance, for SiO2 interlayer thicknesses of ~3–14nm, the recombination parameter of an n+ Si surface having a high surface doping concentration Ns of 2×1020cm−3 was reduced from J0n+=81fA/cm2 to J0n+=50fA/cm2. Simulations predict that the SiO2/Al2O3 stacks outperform Al2O3 passivation layers particularly on n+ Si surfaces having a moderate Ns in the range of 1018–1020cm−3. On p+ Si surfaces, J0p+≤54fA/cm2 was achieved for all ALD SiO2 interlayer thicknesses investigated (i.e., 1–14nm). The SiO2/Al2O3 stacks presented in this work are compatible with SiNx capping and subsequent high-temperature firing steps, which are typically used in solar cell processing. Furthermore, the results were successfully reproduced in an industrial ALD batch reactor using a low-temperature process. This makes ALD SiO2/Al2O3 stacks a promising candidate for the simultaneous passivation of n+ and p+ Si surfaces in solar cells.

Abstract: Liquid phase crystallization of silicon is a promising technology to grow crystalline silicon thin films on glass. It has already been demonstrated that open circuit voltages of up to 656mV and efficiencies of up to 11.8% can be achieved by this technique. Nevertheless further improvements are required to become competitive with wafer based silicon solar cells. A possibility to improve the quality is to enlarge the grain size and to control the crystallographic orientation of the resulting layers. While a preferential {100} surface orientation can be triggered utilizing suitable crystallization parameters, the in-plane orientation still remains random. Also the grain size stays within the same range. By introducing a local monocrystalline seed at the beginning of the crystallization process, we are able to control both the surface and the in-plane orientation of the silicon films. In addition the grain size is significantly increased in scanning direction and only limited by the substrate size of 5cm. This high morphological quality is accompanied by an improved electrical quality confirmed by photoluminescence imaging and Hall measurements. This is a big step towards the final goal to directly grow monocrystalline silicon thin films on glass substrates.

Abstract: Development of inexpensive and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is critically important for the cost-effective electrochromic device (ECD) fabrication. The SPEs are also an integral part of the flexible ECDs which are projected to boost up the ECD's usability in several unexplored areas. Here we report the synthesis of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) based aprotic salt (LiClO4) containing SPEs, which are more or less electrochemically benign in the normal ECD operational voltage window. Experiments verified that the developed SPEs have good luminous clarity (transmittance>92%), high ionic conductivity of the order of 10−4S/cm and excellent dimensional stability, all of which are required for the ideal ECD operations. Impedance spectroscopy showed an enhancement in the ionic conductivity and decrease in the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) resistance with increasing salt loading. Two different device configurations using these SPEs were fabricated and then subjected to detailed electrochemical studies. Comprehensive analysis established long term cyclic durability of the SPEs. Prototype ECDs fabricated using these SPEs rendered excellent optical modulation and coloration reversibility.

Differential activation of NF-κB signaling is associated with platinum and taxane resistance in MyD88 deficient epithelial ovarian cancer cells,

Abstract: Development of chemoresistance is a major impediment to successful treatment of patients suffering from epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Among various molecular factors, presence of MyD88, a component of TLR-4/MyD88 mediated NF-κB signaling in EOC tumors is reported to cause intrinsic paclitaxel resistance and poor survival. However, 50–60% of EOC patients do not express MyD88 and one-third of these patients finally relapses and dies due to disease burden. The status and role of NF-κB signaling in this chemoresistant MyD88negative population has not been investigated so far. Using isogenic cellular matrices of cisplatin, paclitaxel and platinum-taxol resistant MyD88negative A2780 ovarian cancer cells expressing a NF-κB reporter sensor, we showed that enhanced NF-κB activity was required for cisplatin but not for paclitaxel resistance. Immunofluorescence and gel mobility shift assay demonstrated enhanced nuclear localization of NF-κB and subsequent binding to NF-κB response element in cisplatin resistant cells. The enhanced NF-κB activity was measurable from in vivo tumor xenografts by dual bioluminescence imaging. In contrast, paclitaxel and the platinum-taxol resistant cells showed down regulation in NF-κB activity. Intriguingly, silencing of MyD88 in cisplatin resistant and MyD88positive TOV21G and SKOV3 cells showed enhanced NF-κB activity after cisplatin but not after paclitaxel or platinum-taxol treatments. Our data thus suggest that NF-κB signaling is important for maintenance of cisplatin resistance but not for taxol or platinum-taxol resistance in absence of an active TLR-4/MyD88 receptor mediated cell survival pathway in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

Abstract: A simple method is described for estimating the contact resistance between a transparent conducting oxide film and a diffusion layer in a silicon solar cell. We have investigated the effect of film growth temperature on the contact resistance between n++-Si and p++-Si layers and In2O3:Sn (ITO) and In2O3:F (IFO) films grown by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. The effect of growth temperature on the properties of the SiOx layer in IFO/SiOx/n++-Si structures has been studied by Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy. The process for IFO deposition on n++-Si layers has been modified in order to reduce the IFO/SiOx/n++-Si contact resistance. The use of modified IFO has reduced the series resistance of an ITO/(p++nn++)Cz-Si/IFO bifacial solar cell for low-concentration applications by 0.13Ωcm2, from 0.39 to 0.26Ωcm2; extended its operating range of concentration ratios by a factor of 1.5, from 1–3.5× to 1–5.3×; and improved its efficiency in the operating range from 17.6–17.9 to 17.7–18.2%.

Abstract: To determine the pharmacologic activity of (−)-lobeline between human (h)α4β2 and hα4β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), functional and structural experiments were performed. The Ca2+ influx results established that (−)-lobeline neither actives nor enhances the function of the studied AChR subtypes, but competitively inhibits hα4β4 AChRs with potency ∼10-fold higher than that for hα4β2 AChRs. This difference is due to a higher binding affinity for the [3H]cytisine sites at hα4β4 compared to hα4β2 AChRs, which, in turn, can be explained by our molecular dynamics (MD) results: (1) higher stability of (−)-lobeline and its hydrogen bonds within the α4β4 pocket compared to the α4β2 pocket, (2) (−)-lobeline promotes Loop C to cap the binding site at the α4β4 pocket, but forces Loop C to get apart from the α4β2 pocket, precluding the gating process elicited by agonists, and (3) the orientation of (−)-lobeline within the α4β4, but not the α4β2, subpocket, promoted by the t− (or t+) rotameric state of α4-Tyr98, remains unchanged during the whole MD simulation. This study gives a detailed view of the molecular and dynamics events evoked by (−)-lobeline supporting the differential binding affinity and subsequent inhibitory potency between hα4β2 and hα4β4 AChRs, and supports the possibility that the latter subtype is also involved in its activity.

Abstract: Electrospun SiO2 nanofibers (in the form of overlaid mat) absorbed with fatty acid eutectics were studied to fabricate form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) for storage and retrieval of thermal energy. The SiO2 nanofibers were made via electrospinning of precursor nanofibers followed by pyrolysis, while four fatty acid eutectics of capric acid–lauric acid (CA–LA), capric acid–myristic acid (CA–MA), capric acid–palmitic acid (CA–PA), and capric acid–stearic acid (CA–SA) were studied as the model PCMs. The morphological structure, absorption capacity, thermal energy storage property, and thermal energy storage/retrieval rates of the developed form-stable composite PCMs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and measurement of melting/freezing time. The results indicated that the electrospun SiO2 nanofibrous mats were highly porous and capable of absorbing a large amount of PCMs, and the absorption capacities of SiO2 nanofibers for the four fatty acid eutectics (i.e., CA–LA, CA–MA, CA–PA and CA–SA) were 82.0, 83.7, 84.2, and 83.1%, respectively. The experimental values of heat enthalpy for the fabricated composite PCMs were slightly lower than the corresponding theoretical values, whereas there were no appreciable changes on phase transition temperatures. In comparison with fatty acid eutectics (without supporting materials), the melting and freezing time periods of the corresponding CA–LA/SiO2, CA–MA/SiO2, CA–PA/SiO2, CA–SA/SiO2 were shortened by 28.6% and 30.8%, 20.0% and 44.4%, 62.5% and 50.0%, and 50.0% and 33.3%, respectively. This study suggested that the fabricated form-stable composite PCMs possessed appropriate phase transition temperatures and high heat enthalpy values; hence, they would have potential applications for low-temperature thermal energy storage/retrieval.

Abstract: Photo-driven catalytic (PDC) water splitting, using either photoelectrochemical cells (PEC-cells), PV-electrolyzers, or some hybrid system in-between, has attracted a lot of attention. In single-cell device architectures for solar hydrogen production, based on single band gap photoabsorbers, there is a fundamental efficiency problem originating from the energy distribution of the solar spectrum and the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements for splitting water. The minimum band gap for a single-junction device in order to withhold unbiased overall water splitting is considered to be at least 2.0eV. This is far from the 1.35eV which is the optimal band gap of a semiconductor for maximum power conversion of light in the solar spectrum. This discrepancy has been termed as the solar spectrum mismatch problem (the SSM-problem). The standard solution to this problem is to construct tandem devices, whereas an alternative is to interconnect several one band gap cells in series, side by side. Both approaches enable the use of low energy photons in the solar spectrum while still providing a sufficiently high photopotential for driving the full reaction, without seriously compromising with the area efficiency. In this paper, the tandem and serial architectures for handling the SSM-problem are analyzed and compared. The analysis is focused towards differences in the limits of optical absorption, the optimal number of optical absorbers, and their corresponding band gaps. Taking losses due to charge carrier separation and catalysis into account, the maximum STH-efficiency for a series interconnected solar splitting device was found to be 24.6%, compared to 32.0% for an optimum tandem device at 1Sun (air mass 1.5, 1000Wm−2). This can be compared with the maximum efficiency of 18.0% for an ideal single band gap photoabsorber in single junction device. The analysis shows that the maximum STH efficiency limits for series interconnected architectures for unassisted solar water splitting are not particularly far behind the more commonly studied tandem devices. They could then be an interesting alternative given the simplicity and versatility of series interconnected device architectures. The analysis also compares how tandem devices and series interconnected devices can differ in terms of charge carrier separation, charge carrier transport, catalysis, overall efficiency, device architecture, and expected cost.

Abstract: We have developed a hydrogenated n-type silicon oxide (n-SiOx:H)/lithium fluoride (LiF) interlayer for effective light trapping in pin-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)-based solar cells with a 200-nm thick intrinsic a-Si:H absorber. The spectral response of the fabricated solar cell is clearly enhanced in the wide wavelength range of 500–750nm because of the reduced plasmonic absorption in the nanotextured metal back contact and effective refractive index grading. The surface morphology of the back contact is effectively smoothened by the insertion of the ultrathin (2.1nm) LiF interlayer. As a result, the short-circuit current is improved by 10.7% from 13.1 to 14.5mA/cm2. Consequently, we have achieved a conversion efficiency of 9.0%.

Abstract: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) has been implicated in the modulation of vascular homeostasis. However, its roles in the apoptotic cell death of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PPARδ modulates oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced apoptosis of VSMCs through the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways. Activation of PPARδ by GW501516, which is a specific ligand, significantly inhibited oxLDL-induced cell death and generation of reactive oxygen species in VSMCs. These inhibitory effects were significantly reversed in the presence of small interfering (si)RNA against PPARδ, or by blockade of the TGF-β or FAK signaling pathways. Furthermore, PPARδ-mediated recovery of FAK phosphorylation suppressed by oxLDL was reversed by SB431542, a specific ALK5 receptor inhibitor, indicating that a TGF-β/FAK signaling axis is involved in the action of PPARδ. Among the protein kinases activated by oxLDL, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was suppressed by ligand-activated PPARδ. In addition, oxLDL-induced expression and translocation of pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic factors were markedly affected in the presence of GW501516. Those effects were reversed by PPARδ siRNA, or inhibitors of TGF-β or FAK, which also suggests that PPARδ exerts its anti-apoptotic effect via a TGF-β/FAK signaling axis. Taken together, these findings indicate that PPARδ plays an important role in the pathophysiology of disease associated with apoptosis of VSMC, such as atherosclerosis and restanosis.

Abstract: LukS-PV, a component of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) THP-1 cells. Here we investigated anti-leukemia activities of LukS-PV in HL-60 cells, using in vitro assays to assess the ability of LukS-PV to mediate cell viability, apoptosis and differentiation; and developing a Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of disseminated AML with the HL-60 cells to examine in vivo anti-leukemia activity. LukS-PV inhibited viability and induced differentiation and apoptosis in the HL-60 AML cell line. In the SCID mice, LukS-PV potently inhibited tumor growth, decreased tumor cell infiltration into peripheral blood and tissues, and significantly increased mean survival time. No severe adverse effects, such as death, weight loss, or pathological changes in livers or spleens were observed in the toxicity test group. These results indicate that LukS-PV may be a novel and effective chemotherapeutic agent against AML.

Abstract: The mechanism for the growth of 3D ZnO nanowall networks in nest-like structure by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique have been investigated for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and biosensor applications. As complex oxides shift towards large volume productions and practical applications, PLD offers a good advantage over other techniques due to the scalability of the produced film/structures, good adhesion between nanostructures and substrates, and preservation of stoichiometric ratio of the target material. In this study, a two-step temperature–pressure approach has been used to grow ZnO nanostructures on Si(100) using PLD. Optimizing this technique, we have structured a 3D ZnO nanowall networks with nest-like feature without any catalyst. Investigating the effect of substrate temperature from 300°C to 750°C and O2 background from 10mTorr to 10Torr, we have grown the nanowall structures by first depositing a thin ZnO seed layer on Si(100) at a substrate temperature of ~300°C and a background oxygen pressure of 10mTorr, subsequently growing the nanowalls at ~550°C and 500mTorr background. The relationship of the PLD parameters and the morphology of the grown nanowalls were examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS). The grown ZnO nanowall networks are single-crystals and highly-oriented on the c-axis. The nest-like structures initially grow on the thermodynamically active sites along the grain boundaries of randomly oriented Zn-rich ZnO (011̅0) plane, which undergoes self-nucleation on the amorphous layer of the Si (100) substrates. The growth mechanisms for the synthesis of the ZnO nanowalls network can be explained by the vapor–solid (VS) model. The PLD-grown 3D ZnO nanowall network has a very high surface-to-volume ratio and appears to be denser than the previously reported ZnO nanowall structures grown by other techniques. This makes the PLD-grown ZnO nanowall a very promising material as photoanodes in DSSCs and an excellent matrix for biomolecule binding for potential applications in biosensors.

Abstract: Silicon germanium (Si1−xGex) is a material with high mobility and relatively low bandgap making it an attractive candidate for the bottom subcell in a multi-junction solar cell. Optical constants of Si1−xGex films grown on silicon substrates with germanium (Ge) compositions of 77%, 82%, 85% and 88% from wavelength of 400nm to 1450nm at room temperature are reported. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to obtain the real part of refractive index for the whole wavelength range and the extinction coefficients for short wavelengths. Optical transmittance ratio of two structures being different only in the thicknesses of the Si1−xGex films is used to extract the extinction coefficients for long wavelengths. We demonstrate that the optical constants of Si1−xGex films grown on silicon substrates with the aid of graded buffer layers are similar to that of their corresponding bulk materials. However, the absorption coefficients of Si1−xGex with 88% Ge determined by us at around 1000nm is three times higher than previously interpolated results. The main reason for this discrepancy may be due to the inaccuracy of interpolation in the wavelength range where the material's bandgap changes very quickly. In addition, it should be noted that the Ge composition of the Si1−xGex films we are able to obtain are determined to be ±1% which is much more accurate than the previous experimentally determined results which have an accuracy of ±5%.

Abstract: Iron is an omnipresent and efficiency-limiting impurity in p-type silicon solar cells. A very useful technique to detect the interstitial iron concentration in boron doped silicon is based on carrier lifetime measurements at two metastable states of iron, namely interstitial and bound to boron. We present a further development of this technique which images the iron concentration not only on wafer level but also on finished solar cells and in this way enables the most direct access to the impact of interstitial iron on cell performance. With the help of this method we reveal that remaining iron in solar cells may be responsible for significantly unstable current–voltage characteristic under illumination. Recommendations for stable cell measurements even for cells containing a significant concentration of iron are given.

Abstract: The abundance of miR-132 ranges from constitutively high in the brain where it is necessary for neuronal development and function, to inducible expression in haematopoietic and endothelial cells where it controls angiogenesis and immune activation. We show that expression of AGO2, a protein central to miRNA-mediated gene silencing and miRNA biogenesis, is negatively regulated by miR-132. Using HeLa cells, we demonstrate that miR-132 interacts with the AGO2 mRNA 3′UTR and suppresses AGO2 expression and AGO2-dependent small RNA-mediated silencing. Similarly, miR-132 over-expression leads to AGO2 suppression in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). During phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activation of HDLECs, miR-132 is induced in a CREB-dependent manner and inhibition of miR-132 results in increased AGO2 expression. In agreement with the role of AGO2 in maintenance of miRNA expression, AGO2 suppression by miR-132 affects the steady state levels of miR-221 and miR-146a, two miRNAs involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, respectively. Our data demonstrate that the miRNA-silencing machinery is subject to autoregulation during primary cell activation through direct suppression of AGO2 by miR-132.

Abstract: Double-shell alginate microcapsules containing paraffin phase change material (PCM) were prepared for latent heat storage by a method of repeated interfacial coacervation/crosslinking. The proposed process consisted of three main steps: (1) preparation of paraffin containing core particles by dripping an O/W emulsion of melted paraffin and aqueous sodium alginate into a calcium chloride ionic cross-linking solution, (2) encapsulation of the core particles into double alginate shell by ionic gelation/crosslinking by repeated interactions between the sodium alginate and calcium chloride solutions, and (3) consolidation of the capsule shells by contact heat treatment. The effects of process parameters such as the sodium alginate concentration, the calcium chloride concentration in certain stages of the process, and the contact time between the formed core particles and the surrounding alginate solution on the paraffin content and the mean diameter of capsules were studied by experimental design and statistical evaluations. The prepared PCM capsules had uniform sizes, core/shell structure, double-walled non-porous alginate coating, tunable void space inside the core, and suitably high paraffin content at properly selected process conditions, corresponding to 95.0J/g melting and 91.7J/g freezing latent heat capacity. Thermogravimetric analysis and repeated thermal cycling evidenced good thermal stability, and proper mechanical strength for leakage free microcapsules.

Abstract: Clotrimazole (CTZ) has been proposed as an antitumoral agent because of its properties that inhibit glycolytic enzymes and detach them from the cytoskeleton. However, the broad effects of the drug, e.g., acting on different enzymes and pathways, indicate that CTZ might also affect several signaling pathways. In this study, we show that CTZ interferes with the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 after a short incubation period (4h), thereby diminishing cell viability, promoting apoptosis, depolarizing mitochondria, inhibiting key glycolytic regulatory enzymes, decreasing the intracellular ATP content, and permeating plasma membranes. CTZ treatment also interferes with autophagy. Moreover, when the incubation is performed under hypoxic conditions, certain effects of CTZ are enhanced, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K), which is inhibited upon CTZ treatment; this inhibition is potentiated under hypoxia. CTZ-induced PI3K inhibition is not caused by upstream effects of CTZ because the drug does not affect the interaction of the PI3K regulatory subunit and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. Additionally, CTZ directly inhibits human purified PI3K in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Pharmacologic and in silico results suggest that CTZ may bind to the PI3K catalytic site. Therefore, we conclude that PI3K is a novel, putative target for the antitumoral effects of CTZ, interfering with autophagy, apoptosis, cell division and viability.

Abstract: In this paper, we report the preparation of the precursor solutions for the deposition of Cu–Co–Mn–Si oxides by a sol–gel method in order to produce black selective coatings for CSP receiver tubes. Their optical properties were investigated by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) was used to visualize the microstructure. Time-of-Flight-Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to determine the profile of atomic distribution and their chemical environment in a triple layered coating on a stainless steel (SS) substrate. The studied material shows high potential for the use in multi-layered graded index coatings for solar energy conversion.

The electrical properties have been investigated by means of dark and illuminated conductivity measurements in the 293–353K temperature range and Hall measurements at room temperature. The influence of growth parameters on the grain boundary barrier height and other associated grain boundary parameters of the CZTS thin films was determined from electrical, optical, and morphological characterization. The CZTS electrical properties relation with secondary phases formation as well as with transport mechanisms is presented.

Abstract: In this study, a method to opto-electronically probe the individual junctions and carrier transport across interfaces in fully printed and coated tandem polymer solar cells is described, enabling the identification of efficiency limiting printing/coating defects. The methods used are light beam induced current (LBIC) mapping, External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, and monochromatic current–voltage (I–V) characterization. Using these methods, inherent limitations to the accuracy of EQE and LBIC measurements on non-ideal tandem solar cells are identified and described through the use of a small-signal electrical model. The model is able to predict the EQE spectrum of the non-ideal polymer tandem solar cell, using extracted values of shunt- and series resistance of the individual junction of the tandem cell. This finally enables LBIC mapping of the individual junctions of the tandem polymer solar cells, using a combination of light and voltage-biasing.

Abstract: In general, traditional growth hormone receptor antagonist can be divided into two major classes: growth hormone (GH) analogues and anti-growth hormone receptor (GHR) antibodies. Herein, we tried to explore a new class of growth hormone receptor (GHR) antagonist that may have potential advantages over the traditional antagonists. For this, we developed a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody growth hormone, termed CG-86. A series of experiments were conducted to characterize and evaluate this antibody, and the results from a competitive receptor-binding assay, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) and epitope mapping demonstrate that CG-86 behaved as a typical Ab2β. Next, we examined its antagonistic activity using in vitro cell models, and the results showed that CG-86 could effectively inhibit growth hormone receptor-mediated signalling and effectively inhibit growth hormone-induced Ba/F3–GHR638 proliferation. In summary, these studies show that an anti-idiotypic antibody (CG-86) has promise as a novel growth hormone receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the current findings also suggest that anti-idiotypic antibody may represent a novel strategy to produce a new class of growth hormone receptor antagonist, and this strategy may be applied with other cytokines or growth factors.

CD73 on B16F10 melanoma cells in CD73-deficient mice promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, neovascularization, macrophage infiltration and metastasis,

Abstract: Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73), an enzyme providing interstitial adenosine, mediates diverse physiological and pathological responses. In tumor progression, it has primarily an immunosuppressive role but is also thought to regulate neovascularization. However, the latter role is still in debate. When B16F10 melanoma was subcutaneously injected into CD73 knockout mice, changes in the tumor vasculature were not always observed. However, we demonstrated earlier that the growth and vascularization of B16F10 melanoma in CD73 knockout mice depend on the low presence of CD73 on tumor cells. To further analyze the role of CD73 on tumor growth and vascularization, we compared the changes in B16F10 melanoma subcutaneously injected into right flank of wild-type mice, CD73 knockout mice lacking host CD73 only, and CD73 knockout mice with tumor cell CD73 either inhibited with AOPCP (adenosine α,β-methylene 5′-diphosphate) or permanently knocked down through genetic modification. We report here that both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 further inhibited tumor growth compared to host CD73 knockout alone. MAP-kinase signaling pathway activation also decreased more strongly in the stable knockdown. There was a significant reduction in the angiogenic activation of blood microvessels as observed by decreased anti-VEGFR2 staining. Stable CD73 knockdown also reduced endothelial cell proliferation as measured by anti-CD105 staining. However, only chemical inhibition with AOPCP significantly augmented the reduction in intratumoral microvessel density induced by host CD73 knockout. Such reduction was not observed when tumor CD73 was knocked down due to the much slower tumor growth and decreased oxygen demand as indicated by the low expression of Bad, a hypoxia marker. Decreased CD73 activity also led to the decreased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF and bFGF that was only partially reversed by hypoxia in tumors treated with AOPCP. Both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 significantly decreased tumor macrophage infiltration and induced microenvironment changes, thereby influencing MI or MII macrophage polarization. Additionally, tumor cell CD73 is important in metastasis formation through adenosine-independent attachment to endothelium. We conclude that even low tumor cell CD73 expression has an undeniable role in melanoma progression, including the regulation of many aspects of angiogenesis. CD73 is thus a viable target in anti-angiogenic melanoma therapy.

Abstract: An adverse in-utero environment is increasingly recognized to predispose to chronic disease in adulthood. Maternal smoking remains the most common modifiable adverse in-utero exposure leading to low birth weight, which is strongly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in later life. In order to investigate underlying mechanisms for such susceptibility, female Balb/c mice were sham or cigarette smoke-exposed (SE) for 6 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring kidneys were examined for oxidative stress, expression of mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial structure as well as renal functional parameters on postnatal day 1, day 20 (weaning) and week 13 (adult age). From birth throughout adulthood, SE offspring had increased renal levels of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), which left a footprint on DNA with increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosin (8-OHdG) in kidney tubular cells. Mitochondrial structural abnormalities were seen in SE kidneys at day 1 and week 13 along with a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and activity of mitochondrial antioxidant Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Smoke exposure also resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (day 1–week 13) and lysosome density (day 1 and week 13). The appearance of mitochondrial defects preceded the onset of albuminuria at week 13. Thus, mitochondrial damage caused by maternal smoking may play an important role in development of CKD at adult life.

Abstract: Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) were prepared by a simple hydrothermal process. Meanwhile, photocatalytic H2 evolution from water over the as-prepared Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 nanoparticles was explored using methanol as a sacrificial reagent. The results indicate that the Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 nanoparticles is an efficient and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from methanol aqueous solution. During the first 5-h irradiation, the rate is up to 13.5mmolh−1g−1. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 nanoparticles can remain almost unchanged after two successive cycles. And the hydrogen evolution rate is still up to 4.62mmolh−1g−1 in the eighth cycle. Therein, Cu–Ni bimetallic deposit serves as charge transferring sites and/or active sites, and plays an important role in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The dramatic photocatalytic activity of the Cu and Ni co-modified TiO2 nanoparticles may be ascribed to the synergy effect between Cu and Ni. At last, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was studied as a function of content of Cu–Ni bimetallic deposit, molar ratio of Cu to Ni, hydrothermal reaction temperature, hydrothermal reaction time, pH, dosage of photocatalyst and concentration of sacrificial reagent, respectively.

Abstract: The differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which are exposed to mechanical stretch in vivo, plays an important role in vascular remodeling during hypertension. Here, we demonstrated the mechanobiological roles of large conductance calcium and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels in this process. In comparison with 5% stretch (physiological), 15% stretch (pathological) induced the de-differentiation of VSMCs, resulting in significantly decreased expressions of VSMC markers, i.e., α-actin, calponin and SM22. The activity of BK channels, assessed by patch clamp recording, was significantly increased by 15% stretch and was accompanied by an increased alternative splicing of BK channel α-subunit at the stress axis-regulated exons (STREX). Furthermore, transfection of whole BK or STREX-deleted BK plasmids revealed that STREX was important for BK channels to sense mechanical stretch. Using thapsigargin (TG) which induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and xbp1-targeted siRNA transfection which blocks ER stress, the results revealed that ER stress was contribute to stretch-induced alternative splicing of STREX. Our results suggested that during hypertension, pathological stretch may induce the ER stress in VSMCs, which affects the alternative splicing and activity of BK channels, and subsequently modulates VSMC differentiation.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to seek possible links between the regionality along the digestive tract and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the effectiveness of the antioxidant defense system and the sensitivity to the types of demise in different gut regions of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Significant changes were observed in the oxidative status and in the activity of the antioxidant defense system in the diabetic colon; the peroxynitrite production was doubled, the level of hemoxygenase-2 protein was increased 11-fold and the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 was also increased. The segment-specific vulnerability of the gastrointestinal tract induced by hyperglycemia was also confirmed by electron microscopy, demonstrating the presence of severe necrosis in the colon of the diabetic rats. No remarkable histopathological alterations were seen in the duodenum of the diabetic animals and there were likewise no significant changes in the production of peroxynitrite in their duodenum, whereas the level of the free radical scavenger metallothionein-2 was increased ∼300-fold.
Conclusion
The spatially restricted vulnerability observed along the digestive tract could originate from a high level of oxidative stress via peroxynitrite production.

Abstract: This paper deals with the preparation, characterization, thermal properties and thermal reliability of form-stable composite phase change materials (PCMs), composed of n-octadecane, expanded vermiculite, and perlite for thermal energy storage. The composite PCMs were prepared by incorporation of liquid n-octadecane within the expanded vermiculite (eVMT) and expanded perlite (ePLT), using a vacuum impregnation method. The microstructures of n-octadecane/expanded vermiculite and pearlite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of the prepared composite PCMs showed good compatibility between n-octadecane and the expanded vermiculite and pearlite. The thermal conductivities of composites were reduced, based on the TCi results. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that the n-octadecane/eVMT and n-odtadecane/ePLT composites maintained their large latent heat capacity and original phase change temperatures, due to large surface area and good dispersion of the eVMT and ePLT. TGA analysis revealed that the prepared composite PCMs had good thermal durability in the working temperature ranges. Therefore, n-octadecane based composite PCMs can be considered as suitable candidates for latent heat thermal energy storage, with high thermal performance.

Abstract: The biotin biosynthesis pathway is an attractive target for development of novel drugs against mycobacterial pathogens, however there are as yet no suitable inhibitors that target this pathway in mycobacteria. 7-Keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase (KAPA synthase, BioF) is the enzyme which catalyzes the first committed step of the biotin synthesis pathway, but both its structure and function in mycobacteria remain unresolved. Here we present the crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis BioF (MsBioF). The structure reveals an incomplete dimer, and the active site organization is similar to, but distinct from Escherichia coli 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (EcAONS), the E. coli homologue of BioF. To investigate the influence of structural characteristics on the function of MsBioF, we deleted bioF in M. smegmatis and confirmed that BioF is required for growth in the absence of exogenous biotin. Based on structural and mutagenesis studies, we confirmed that pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) binding site residues His129, Lys235 and His200 are essential for MsBioF activity in vivo and residue Glu171 plays an important, but not essential role in MsBioF activity. The N-terminus (residues 1–37) is also essential for MsBioF activity in vivo. The structure and function of MsBioF reported here provides further insights for developing new anti-tuberculosis inhibitors aimed at the biotin synthesis pathway.

Abstract: Oxidative stress, caused by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been hypothesized to cause or exacerbate skeletal muscle wasting in a number of diseases and chronic conditions. ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide, have the potential to affect signal transduction pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt pathway that regulates protein synthesis. Previous studies have found contradictory outcomes for the effect of ROS on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, where oxidative stress can either enhance or inhibit Akt phosphorylation. The apparent contradictions could reflect differences in experimental cell types or types of ROS treatments. We replicate both effects in myotubes of cultured skeletal muscle C2C12 cells, and show that increased oxidative stress can either inhibit or enhance Akt phosphorylation. This differential response could be explained: thiol oxidation of Akt, but not the phosphatases PTEN or PP2A, caused a decline in Akt phosphorylation; whereas the thiol oxidation of Akt, PTEN and PP2A increased Akt phosphorylation. These observations indicate that a more complete understanding of the effects of oxidative stress on a signal transduction pathway comes not only from identifying the proteins susceptible to thiol oxidation, but also their relative sensitivity to ROS.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layers made by spin-coating a solution comprising poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticles have been shown to adopt a non-uniform concentration profile across the thin film dimension. This inhomogeneous distribution can reduce the efficiency of the device. In the present work a new process, gas expanded polymer (GXP) annealing, is applied to P3HT/PCBM thin film blends, enabling the distribution of the PCBM nanoparticles to be manipulated by varying the GXP processing conditions. Films of 50nm thickness (nominally) created by spin casting a blend of P3HT mixed with PCBM were annealed by oscillatory GXP and GXP at constant pressure using high pressure CO2. An increase in P3HT crystallinity (detected by X-ray diffraction and UV–vis spectroscopy) along with a more uniform distribution of PCBM nanoparticles in the thickness dimension, as interpreted from neutron reflectivity measurements, were observed after oscillatory GXP annealing. In addition, static water contact angles suggest that the film/air interface is enriched in PCBM relative to the as-cast film. These results demonstrate that GXP annealing, which is commercially scalable, can be successfully used to create a uniform distribution of PCBM nanoparticles across the thickness dimension in a P3HT thin film.

Abstract: Despite the many similarities between Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 materials and device architecture, open questions remain about the optimal surface preparation steps for CZTSSe absorbers, including whether differences exist for absorber layers deposited by different methods. In this work, we investigate KCN etching and NH4OH treatment as surface preparation methods for the absorber/CdS interface for two-stage processed CZTSSe and co-evaporated CZTSe absorber layers. Ambient-exposed, thus oxidized and contaminated, thin film absorbers are utilized to examine the effectiveness of these surface preparation methods and to elucidate their effects on device performance. Topography and surface potential images simultaneously obtained by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) show the existence of an overlayer on the ambient-exposed absorbers. Moreover, KPFM results also demonstrate that although NH4OH treatment removes much of the overlayer from the CZTSSe surface, KCN etching removes the overlayer completely. In addition, differences in the deposited CdS layer and depletion region width result depending on the surface preparation method, with the NH4OH-treated solar cells having narrower depletion region. This is reflected in device results in which KCN-etched solar cells outperform their NH4OH-treated counterparts due to increases in external quantum efficiency at long wavelengths and in open circuit voltage. KPFM measurements also demonstrate that grain boundaries (GBs) in the KCN-etched two-stage processed CZTSSe thin films are either negatively charged or neutral. On the other hand, KCN etching makes the surface almost equipotential in the co-evaporated CZTSe thin film by causing disappearance of positively charged GBs that existed before etching.

Abstract: Ternary CuxSnySz thin films with different Cu/Sn atomic ratios and thicknesses have been electrochemically deposited on the (111) face of a silver single crystal. The surface morphology and chemical composition of these chalcogenides, which have attracted considerable worldwide interest as low cost high conversion efficiency photovoltaic devices, have been characterized by means of SEM, parallel angle resolved (PAR-XPS) and TOF-SIMS depth profiling in order to gain insight into the morphology and element distribution within the layer and their effect on the band gap. This study constitutes the first in-depth chemical study on CuxSnySz thin films, providing evidence of notable discrepancies between the expected and real composition, especially regarding the Cu/Sn ratio. The samples were found to be chemically homogeneous through the whole deposit even though strongly tin depleted regardless their thickness or deposition sequence. Finally, the literature band gap data were discussed on the basis of these findings.

Abstract: Background & Aims
Liver regeneration (LR) consists of a series of complicated processes in which several transcription factors play important roles. Among them, the early growth response 1 gene (EGR-1) is rapidly induced in response to liver resection. Previous studies have shown that EGR-1−/− mice exhibit delayed hepatocellular mitotic progression after partial hepatectomy (PH). The mechanism underlying the EGR-1 regulated LR is still unknown. Our aim is to elucidate the underlying mechanism.
Methods
Mice infected with adenoviral vectors expressing GFP, EGR-1 or dominant negative EGR-1 (dnEGR-1) were subjected to 2/3 PH. The serum starvation recovery cell model was chosen to mimic the regeneration process for the in vitro studies. Cell proliferation and signaling pathways downstream of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) were examined in the regenerating liver and serum starvation recovery cell model.
Results
Loss of function of EGR-1 significantly inhibited liver recovery and the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The expression of GGPPS and the activity of the downstream RAS/MAPK pathway were inhibited in dnEGR-1-infected liver, which was consistent with the serum-induced cell model. In addition, loss of function of EGR-1 aggravated liver damage with increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.
Conclusions
EGR-1-induced GGPPS plays a vital role in the LR after PH through the RAS/MAPK signaling.

Abstract: Purpose
High interest in triple-negative breast cancers is not surprising as this category of patients benefits neither from hormonal therapies nor from anti HER2 treatments. Blockade of angiogenesis by metronomic chemotherapy as well as other antiangiogenics might improve outcomes in this group of patients. This study aims to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of metronomic capecitabine as extended adjuvant treatment for women with triple-negative breast cancer.
Methods
This is a prospective phase II study that included 41 patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer and who were indicated for adjuvant chemotherapy. They received capecitabine 500mg PO twice daily and continuously for six months after finishing six cycles of adjuvant FEC100±postoperative radiotherapy.
Results
Forty-one patients were enrolled in this study between June 2010 and December 2013. Median age was 50years ranging from 27 to 67years. Treatment was well tolerated. Adverse effects were grade 1 palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia in 13 patients (31.7%); grade 1 diarrhea in five patients (12.2%); and grade 1 vomiting in two patients (4.9%). Estimated median follow-up duration was 34 months. Estimated mean disease-free survival (DFS) was 42.4months (95% CI, 39.02–45.79), while median DFS was not reached. Estimated mean overall survival was 44.34months (95% CI 41.9–46.9).
Conclusion
Extended adjuvant metronomic capecitabine is well tolerated with patient compliance. These results need to be compared in a study with control arm, larger sample, as well as longer follow-up.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimer transcription factor complex that monitors the cellular response to the oxygen levels in cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown to be stabilized by ionizing radiation (IR) and its stabilization promotes tumor progression and metastasis. Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1), a component of the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complex, plays an important role in the cellular response to DNA damage but its overexpression contributes to transformation and has been found to correlate with metastasis. However, whether NBS1 participates in IR-induced metastasis needs to be further determined. The aim of this study is to investigate whether radiation-induced HIF-1α stabilization is regulated by NBS1 and thereby promotes tumor cell migration/invasion. Here, we show that both NBS1 and HIF-1α expression are up-regulated after exposure to IR, and NBS1 increases HIF-1α expression at the protein level. In addition, IR treatment promotes the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in vitro cell migration and invasion activity, which could be abolished by suppression of NBS1. Furthermore, NBS1 directly interacts with HIF-1α and reduces the ubiquitination of HIF-1α⋅ Co-expression of HIF-1α and NBS1 in primary tumors of patients with lung adenocarcinoma correlates with a worse prognosis. These results provide a new function of NBS1 in stabilizing HIF-1α under IR, which leads to enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion.

Abstract: The choice of the optimum semiconductor for manufacturing thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells is not straightforward. In contrast to conventional solar photovoltaics (PV) where the optimum semiconductor bandgap is determined solely by the spectrum (and eventually the irradiance) of the incident solar light, in a TPV converter it depends on the emitter temperature and on the spectral control elements determining the net spectral power flux between the TPV cell and the emitter. Additionally, in TPV converters there is a tradeoff between power density and conversion efficiency that does not exist in conventional solar PV systems. Thus, the choice of the proper semiconductor compound in TPV converters requires a thorough analysis that has not been presented so far. This paper presents the optimum semiconductor bandgaps leading to the maximum efficiency and power density in TPV converters using both single junction and multijunction TPV cells. These results were obtained within the framework of the detailed balance theory and assuming only radiative recombination. Optimal bandgaps are provided as a function of the emitter and cell temperature, as well as the degree of spectral control. I show that multijunction TPV cells are excellent candidates to maximize both the efficiency and the power density simultaneously, eliminating the historical tradeoff between efficiency and power density of TPV converters. Finally, multijunction TPV cells are less sensitive to photon recycling losses, which suggest that they can be combined with relatively simple cut-off spectral control systems to provide practically-viable high performing TPV devices.

Abstract: The anti-transplant rejection drug cyclosporin A (CsA) causes loss of collagen homeostasis in rapidly remodeling connective tissues, such as human gingiva. As a result of CsA treatment, collagen degradation by fibroblasts is inhibited, which leads to a net increase of tissue collagen and gingival overgrowth. Since fibrillar collagen is the primary ligand for the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), we hypothesized that CsA perturbs DDR1-associated functions that affect collagen homeostasis. For these experiments, human fibroblasts obtained from gingival explants or mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (wild type, over-expressing DDR1 or DDR1 knockdown) or mouse GD25 cells (expressing DDR1 but null for β1 integrin), were treated with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or with CsA. The effect of CsA on cell binding to collagen was examined by flow cytometry; cell-mediated collagen remodeling was analyzed with contraction, compaction and migration assays. We found that CsA inhibited cell binding to collagen, internalization of collagen, contraction of collagen gels and cell migration over collagen in a DDR1-dependent manner. CsA also enhanced collagen compaction around cell extensions. Treatment with CsA strongly reduced surface levels of β1 integrins in wild type and DDR1 over-expressing 3T3 cells but did not affect β1 integrin activation or focal adhesion formation. We conclude that CsA inhibition of collagen remodeling is mediated through its effects on both DDR1 and cell surface levels of the β1 integrin.

Abstract: We report a single heterojunction solar cell model based on crystalline p-silicon and n-zinc oxide. The ZnO can act as front n-layer as well as antireflection coating saving processing cost and complexity. Experiments are performed to find optimized growth window using MOCVD to achieve maximum transmission in ZnO as front layer of the solar cell. Gallium-rich ZnO:Ga films are also grown to improve optical properties of the front layer. Optical characterizations of pristine ZnO and gallium-rich ZnO:Ga are presented. The modified PC1D software is used to find the optimized parameters for the solar cell. Absorption spectrum of ~0.5µm thick ZnO film grown in our lab was used in the simulations to get realistic results. Simulations anticipated conversion efficiency of 19% and fill factor of 81%.

Abstract: The effects of the CuxS stoichiometry, 1≤x≤2, on the optical, electrical, and solar thermal properties of copper sulphide thin films, which have been deposited by chemical spray pyrolysis onto glass, have been studied. A full 32 factorial design has been applied to determine the effects of the substrate temperature and deposition time on the electrical and optical properties of the sulphide thin films. The sulphide film properties are strongly related to the CuxS stoichiometry, and this relationship is dependent on the substrate temperature. Therefore, the electrical resistivity of the films varies in the range of 10−4Ωcm to 10−1Ωcm as × increases from 1 to 2. The relationship between the stoichiometry and conductivity has been established with infrared reflectance, solar absorptance and thermal emittance. The optical constants have been obtained using optical models (Classical Drude).

Abstract: We present an optoelectronic analytical model for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. Incorporating optical transfer matrix theory in the electrical transport equations, we combine optical and electrical phenomena. This leads us to a single unified expression of current–voltage characteristic which considers the position and wavelength dependent carrier generation rate. Spatial distribution of the carrier generation rate is considered rigorously unlike previous analytical models. The model is capable of considering the optical propagation through the device structure as well as the optical phenomena such as reflections and interference effects. We verify the model with numerical results and published experimental data.

Abstract: A novel idea that using chemical bath deposition-annealing route for preparing absorber films of the Cu2ZnSnS4−xSex solar cells with stacked layers (ZnS/Cu/SnS) was proposed and carried out in this study. The absorber layers fabricated by this new method were demonstrably proper for solar cell devices. The solar cells based on the as-synthesized Cu2ZnSnS4−xSex/Cu2ZnSnS4 layers showed high photoelectric transformation efficiency, nearly 3.0% and 2.2% with the large area 1.27cm2 and 1.80cm2, respectively. The new method introduced here based on chemical bath deposition without the complexity of vacuum equipment may provide an alternative approach to produce large area solar cells for practical application. In addition, during the deposition of the stacked layers, a new concept called Assistant Reduction Reaction was firstly carried out to deposit metallic Cu thin film on the SnS film, which acted as not only a substrate, but also an assistant reductive agent. If the present technique is properly extended, it is possible for the preparation of other metal thin films for practical application.

The physical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers were fully characterized. The polymers displayed exceptional solubility in common organic solvents. The polymers were fabricated as the electrochromic layer in absorption/transmission type electrochromic devices. Upon oxidation, the polymer films switched from a dark red to a grayish hue, displaying optical contrasts of about 20% and 40% in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions respectively, as well as reasonable ambient stabilities. In particular, the polymers exhibited rapid sub-second coloration times with exceptionally high coloration efficiencies of up to 1066cm2/C in the visible region. Contrary to the traditional electrochromic conjugated polymers that typically show prolonged optical memory, these polymers exhibited a tendency to quickly lose their optical memory.

Abstract: An alkali-metal containing (AC) layer, specifically sodium (Na), is necessary for improving Cu(InxGa1-x)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell performance on an alkali-free flexible substrate. However, we found that Na from the AC precursor layer diffused not only into the CIGS absorber layer but also into our flexible metal foil substrate, the surface of which was covered with an Al2O3 layer, and thus creating Na depletion in the CIGS layer. In this work, newly developed alkali-metal block (AB) layers are introduced between the AC layers and the metal foil substrates in order to suppress Na diffusion into the substrates and enhance Na diffusion into the CIGS layers. Using different AB layer materials—Ti, TiO2, and TiN—and AC layers with systematically-varied thickness, Na concentrations in the CIGS layers and the solar cell efficiencies are investigated. Ti and TiN AB layers efficiently enhance the Na diffusion into the CIGS absorber layers. As a result, a high efficiency of 17.6% is obtained on the metal foil substrate using optimally prepared AC and AB layer of TiN. The AB layer controls the Na diffusion from the AC layer in one direction, and thus contributes to the precise control of Na concentrations in the CIGS layer. Hence, high efficiency solar cells on a variety of flexible substrates will be achieved comparable to those on soda-lime glass substrates.

Abstract: TiO2 nanotube arrays sensitized with AgInS2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NTs/AgInS2) were successfully fabricated by a two-step process of anodization followed by a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The structural investigation by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the AgInS2 nanoparticles of diameters ~15nm grew uniformly on the walls of the TiO2 nanotubes. The TiO2 NTs/AgInS2 exhibits excellent photocurrent and photoelectrocatalytic activities under visible light irradiation. The enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance could be explained by the optoelectronic coupling between dispersed AgInS2 nanoparticles and TiO2 NTs.

Abstract: Background
The physio-chemical properties of blood contacting biomaterials play an important role in determining their hemocompatibility. It is shown in literature that surface roughness and porosity have significant effect on hemocompatibility. In this study, we use a biocompatible, low thrombogenic nanocomposite polymer called POSS-PCU to test this hypothesis: would porosity compromise the hemocompatibility of POSS-PCU. We compared the hemocompatibility of POSS-PCU films of various pore sizes with PTFE, which is a commercially available material used in most blood contacting devices.
Methods
Sterilized POSS-PCU films with different size pores were prepared as samples and porous PTFE film were selected as control. And all samples were subjected to SEM for topograpgy, mechanical test for characterization and hemocompatibility tests to evaluate contact activation, platelet adhesion and activation, as well as whole blood clotting response to the samples.
Results
WCA significantly increased with the pore size of POSS-PCU film, whereas both tensile stress and strain decreased significantly as the sizes of pores increased. However, when compared to PTFE film with same size pores, POSS-PCU films showed both higher tensile stress and strain. Pore size had little impact over POSS-PCU's surface chemistry groups as tested by FTIR analysis. Contact activation and platelet adhesion essay also showed no significant difference between different POSS-PCU samples. However, in whole blood reactions, POSS-PCU with pores size around 2–5μm showed higher BCI than plain films and those with pores size around 35–45μm. POSS-PCU showed lower thrombogencity and higher hemocompatibility comparing with porous PTFE on the aspects of platelet activation, adhesion and whole blood reaction.
Summary and conclusions
POSS-PCU polymer films as a biomaterial in chronic blood contacting implants show significant lower thrombogencity and higher hemocompatibility than porous PTFE film. It is desirable as a coating or covering material in small diameter stents for treating cardiovascular diseases, cerebral vascular diseases and peripheral arterial diseases.

Abstract: Transplantation of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has potential therapeutic effects on cardiac muscle repair. However, the underlying mechanism remains not completely clarified. Here we show that transplantation of MSCs significantly increased local recruitment of macrophages to facilitate cardiac muscle repair. MSCs-induced recovery of cardiac function and attenuation of fibrosis after injury were all abolished by either impaired macrophage infiltration, or by MSCs depletion after macrophage recruitment. However, angiogenesis seemed to be only affected by depletion of macrophages, but not by depletion of MSCs, suggesting that macrophages are responsible for the augmented angiogenesis after MSCs transplantation, while MSCs do not directly contribute to angiogenesis in the functional cardiac repair. Moreover, high level of transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1) was detected in macrophages and high level of BMP7 was detected in MSCs, suggesting that MSCs not only may recruit macrophages to enhance angiogenesis to promote regeneration, but also may secrete BMP7 to contradict the fibrogenic effect of TGFβ1 by macrophages. Our study thus sheds new insight on the interaction of MSCs and macrophages in a functional cardiac repair triggered by MSCs transplantation.

Abstract: Physiological development requires precise spatiotemporal regulation of cellular and molecular processes. Disruption of these key events can generate developmental toxicity in the form of teratogenesis or mortality. The mechanism behind many developmental toxicants remains unknown. While recent work has focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the pathogenesis of disease, few studies have addressed their relationship in developmental toxicity. Redox regulation, UPR, and apoptosis are essential for physiological development and can be disturbed by a variety of endogenous and exogenous toxicants to generate lethality and diverse malformations. This review examines the current knowledge of the role of oxidative stress, UPR, and apoptosis in physiological development as well as in developmental toxicity, focusing on studies and advances in vertebrates model systems.

Abstract: Photon conversion layers are a possible way of improving the efficiency of existing solar cells, even above the Shockley–Queisser limit. The related concepts are often called downshifting, downconversion, and upconversion. Despite the variety of photon conversion systems proposed in the literature, understanding their real impact is often difficult due to joint effects. Here, a new methodology is provided to analyse the efficiency of such conversion layers and to be able to compare the different systems proposed.

Abstract: CdS nanoparticles with well-defined crystallinity were assembled on vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2 NRAs) to form CdS/TiO2 NTAs heterostructures by cyclic voltammetry electrochemical deposition. The morphology and structure of CdS/TiO2 NTAs heterostructure were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the amount of CdS nuclei on TiO2 surface and the bond between CdS nuclei and TiO2 nanorod were improved by increasing hydrophilicity of TiO2 nanorod surface, and well crystalline CdS nanocrystals were deposited on TiO2 nanorod (001) surface with good bonding between CdS nanoparticle and TiO2 nanorod. With increased hydrophilicity of TiO2 nanorod surface, the Jsc, Voc and τe of CdS/TiO2 NRAs heterostructure were increased. Especially, PEC (2.29%) was increased by near three times. This is because that CdS nanoparicles were uniformly dispersed on TiO2 NRAs and had good bond with TiO2 nanorods.

Abstract: We report here on the development of a rear-side point-contact scheme for liquid-phase-crystallized silicon on glass solar cells, which uses laser for all structuring and contact-post-treatment steps. Our contact scheme is based on the procedure developed by CSG Solar and contains two main innovations. First, we demonstrate here that it is possible to form contact holes in the back-reflector resist layer by laser ablation instead of printing droplets of an etch solution with inkjet. The use of laser for forming holes in the resist holds promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of this process. Second, we show that for both p and n-type absorbers, laser firing at the absorber-point-contacts can be used to increase the doping concentration beneath the metal contact and thereby achieve low-resistance contacts. Using the All-by-Laser Point-contact Scheme (ALPS) we were able to reach a solar cell conversion efficiency of 11.5% for a planar n-type laser-crystallized silicon absorber with an amorphous/crystalline heterojunction structure.

Abstract: Highly efficient SnO2−x/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were synthesized using simple calcination of g-C3N4 and Sn6O4(OH)4. The synthesized composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under visible light irradiation. The optimal RhB degradation rate of the composite was 0.088min−1, which was 8.8 times higher than that of g-C3N4. The SnO2−x/g-C3N4 composite also showed high photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction and photodegradation of other organic compounds. Various techniques including Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and an electrochemical method were applied to determine the origin of the enhanced photoactivity of SnO2−x/g-C3N4. Results indicated that the introduction of SnO2−x on g-C3N4 increased its surface area and enhanced light absorption performance. More importantly, a hetero-junction structure was formed between SnO2−x and g-C3N4, which efficiently promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs by a direct Z-scheme mechanism to enhance the photocatalytic activity. This study might represent an important step for the conversion of solar energy using cost-efficient materials.

Abstract: Efficient solar cells require both strong absorption and effective collection of photogenerated carriers. With these requirements in mind, the absorber layer should be optically thick but electrically thin, to benefit from reduced bulk transport losses. It is therefore important to clarify whether thin-film silicon solar cells can compete with conventional wafer-based devices. In this paper we present a theoretical study of optical and electro-optical performance of thin-film crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells implementing light-trapping schemes. First, we use Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA) to assess the light-trapping capabilities of a number of photonic structures characterized by different levels of disorder. Then, we present two approaches for electro-optical modeling of textured solar cells: a simplified analytic model and a numerical approach that combines RCWA and the Finite-Element Method. We consider both bulk and surface recombination in solar cells with the absorber thickness ranging from 1 to 100μm. Our results predict that with state-of-the-art material quality of thin c-Si layers, the optimal absorber thickness is of the order of tens of microns. Furthermore, we show that thin-film solar cells with realistic material parameters can outperform bulk ones, provided surface recombination is below a critical value, which is compatible with present-day surface passivation technologies. This gives prospects for high-efficiency solar cells with much smaller c-Si thickness than in present wafer-based ones.

Abstract: Sprouty proteins control length and intensity of the intracellular signal transduction cascade activated by mitogens in the cellular environment. As part of a negative feedback loop, their expression is supposed to be elevated by the same factors. In this report, Sprouty4 expression in response to serum and the underlying regulatory mechanisms were investigated. We verified that Sprouty4 expression is activated by serum addition in all tested cells independent of their origin. Strict correlation between Sprouty4 protein levels and promoter activity indicates mainly transcriptional regulation of Sprouty4 serum-responsiveness. Induction of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for Sprouty4 promoter activation in the presence of serum. Nonetheless, signal transduction via this pathway is not sufficient to fully induce the Sprouty4 promoter. Instead, deletion and mutation analysis identified two annotated Specific protein 1 binding sites as the critical cis-elements responsible for conferring the serum induction of the promoter. Corroborating, repressed Specific protein 1 activity or levels result in constitutive lowered transcriptional activity of the Sprouty4 promoter. These data demonstrate that Specific protein 1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of Sprouty4 in response to serum.

Abstract: The microstructural properties of polycrystalline silicon films obtained by either solid-phase crystallisation (SPC) or laser-induced liquid-phase crystallisation (LPC) were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In SPC films, the most common intra-grain defects are dislocations with the density as high as 1E10cm−2 determined from cross-sectional weak-beam dark-field images. The highest dislocation density in LPC film is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the SPC film, 1E8cm−2 and typically it is below 1E6cm−2. The most common defect type in LPC films is twin boundaries and other junctions of different coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries. Such differences in the material structural properties result in far superior electrical performance of solar cells made of LPC films, such as mobility up to 400cm2V−1s−1, similar to c-Si wafers, and the higher open-circuit voltage up to 585mV.

Abstract: We have previously reported that translation of acetylcholine receptor α-subunit (AChR α) mRNA in skeletal muscle cells is regulated by Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) in response to neural activity, and that in the postnatal mouse developmental changes in the amount of YB-1 mRNA are similar to those of AChR α mRNA, which is known to be regulated by myogenic transcription factors. Here, we examined transcriptional regulation of the YB-1 gene in mouse skeletal muscle and differentiating C2C12 myocytes. Although neither YB-1 nor AChR α was detected at either the mRNA or protein level in adult hind limb muscle, YB-1 expression was transiently activated in response to denervation of the sciatic nerve and completely paralleled that of AChR α, suggesting that these genes are regulated by the same transcription factors. However, during differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes, the level of YB-1 remained constant even though the level of AChR α increased markedly. Reporter gene, gel mobility shift and ChIP assays revealed that in the initial stage of myocyte differentiation, transcription of the YB-1 gene was regulated by E2F1 and Sp1, and was then gradually replaced under the control of both MyoD and myogenin through an E-box sequence in the proximal region of the YB-1 gene promoter. These results suggest that transcription factors for the YB-1 gene are exchanged during skeletal muscle cell differentiation, perhaps playing a role in translational control of mRNAs by YB-1 in both myotube formation and the response of skeletal muscle tissues to neural stimulation.

Abstract: Mechanisms associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unclear. We attempted to identify the pattern of altered gene expression at different time points in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The early up-regulated genes are mainly involved in the innate immune responses, while the late up-regulated genes represent the inflammation processes. Although recent studies have shown that microRNAs play important roles in hepatic metabolic functions, the pivotal role of microRNAs in the progression of NAFLD is not fully understood. We investigated the functions of miR-451, which was identified as a target gene in the inflammatory process in NAFLD. miR-451 expression was significantly decreased in the palmitate (PA)-exposed HepG2 cells and in liver tissues of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. Its decreased expressions were also observed in liver specimens of NASH patients. In vitro analysis of the effect of miR-451 on proinflammatory cytokine provided evidence for negative regulation of PA-induced interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production. Furthermore, miR-451 over-expression inhibited translocation of the PA-induced NF-κB p65 subunit into the nucleus. Our result showed that Cab39 is a direct target of miRNA-451 in steatotic cells. Further study showed that AMPK activated through Cab39 inhibits NF-κB transactivation induced in steatotic HepG2 cells. miR-451 over-expression in steatotic cells significantly suppressed PA-induced inflammatory cytokine. These results provide new insights into the negative regulation of miR-451 in fatty acid-induced inflammation via the AMPK/AKT pathway and demonstrate potential therapeutic applications for miR-451 in preventing the progression from simple steatosis to severely advanced liver disease.

Abstract: The t(8;21) translocation is the most widespread genetic defect found in human acute myeloid leukemia. This translocation results in the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 fusion gene that produces a wide variety of alternative transcripts and influences the course of the disease. The rules of combinatorics and splicing of exons in the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 transcripts are not known. To address this issue, we developed an exon graph model of the fusion gene organization and evaluated its local exon combinatorics by the exon combinatorial index (ECI). Here we show that the local exon combinatorics of the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 gene follows a power-law behavior and (i) the vast majority of exons has a low ECI, (ii) only a small part is represented by “exons-hubs” of splicing with very high ECI values, and (iii) it is scale-free and very sensitive to targeted skipping of “exons-hubs”. Stochasticity of the splicing machinery and preferred usage of exons in alternative splicing can explain such behavior of the system. Stochasticity may explain up to 12% of the ECI variance and results in a number of non-coding and unproductive transcripts that can be considered as a noise. Half-life of these transcripts is increased due to the deregulation of some key genes of the nonsense-mediated decay system in leukemia cells. On the other hand, preferred usage of exons may explain up to 75% of the ECI variability. Our analysis revealed a set of splicing-related cis-regulatory motifs that can explain “attractiveness” of exons in alternative splicing but only when they are considered together. Cis-regulatory motifs are guides for splicing trans-factors and we observed a leukemia-specific profile of expression of the splicing genes in t(8;21)-positive blasts. Altogether, our results show that alternative splicing of the RUNX1–RUNX1T1 transcripts follows strict rules and that the power-law component of the fusion gene organization confers a high flexibility to this process.

Abstract: A new type of SnO2:F film has been deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on textured glass substrates, and it is used for the fabrication of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film solar cells. These substrates are found to be highly effective in terms of their optical and electrical properties. They also facilitate the fabrication of efficient top cells for a future multi-junction solar cell. These substrates have a micron-order texture feature size, which is much larger than the a-Si absorber layer thickness. Still, they produce higher current in the 300–550nm wavelength range with a higher open circuit voltage than cells on multi-scale textured ZnO:B substrates. This work examines the applicability of this new SnO2:F coated glass substrate with different texture profiles on a-Si solar cells in the wavelength range of 300–550nm.

Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) was deposited on aluminum-induced polycrystalline silicon (AIC-pc-Si) thin film, instead of on a conventional bulk silicon (Si) substrate, and n-ZnO/p-AIC-pc-Si heterojunction photodetectors (HPDs) were fabricated. It is found that the usage of AIC-pc-Si film can largely reduce the visible response by nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared to the conventional Si substrate, making the HPDs practical for real ultraviolet (UV) detection. The drastically reduced visible response achieves a much higher UV (340nm)/visible (500nm) rejection ratio of 2.1×103 than that (7.82) in conventional ZnO/p-Si substrate HPDs. Two major contributions are responsible for the drastic reduction in visible response. One is the very thin (300nm) AIC-pc-Si film, which is much thinner than the bulk Si substrate (about 600μm); the very thin AIC-pc-Si film absorbs very few visible photons and hence lowers visible response. Another issue is the addition of Al atom. During the deposition of ZnO, Al atoms diffuse from the AIC-pc-Si film and build up a bump between the ZnO and AIC-pc-Si. The addition of Al in ZnO increases the electron concentration of ZnO, creating a new structure of n-ZnO/n+-ZnO/AIC-pc-Si. The corresponding band diagram shows a hollow region exists in the n+-ZnO, where the visible-light-generating electrons are recombined by the defect states at n-ZnO/AIC-pc-Si interface, largely suppressing the visible response.

Abstract: Combined electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were conducted in order to investigate the presence of luminescent emission of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge at different operating conditions of the tandem. Luminescent emission from cell samples was observed at different sun concentrations, voltage biases and temperatures. A high intensity pulsed solar simulator was used to photoexcite the device which exhibited strong radiative recombination from both the top InGaP and middle InGaAs junctions. Luminescent emission from the device was investigated under a range of voltage biases and was clearly observed at the maximum power point voltage of the sample under test indicating its presence during typical operating conditions of the solar cells. Investigation of the emission was also performed at relatively high temperatures (up to 60°C) in order to mimic the outdoor operating conditions of a solar cell device. Luminescence was detected at high temperatures indicating that significant radiative recombination is present at even higher temperatures. Outdoor measurements under actual solar spectrum demonstrated the presence of luminescent emission in agreement with indoor testing. The significant amount of radiative recombination at the band-gap edges of the top junctions observed in our measurements gives evidence that optical coupling to the lower ones may occur. Finally, excitation power dependent PL was performed using monochromatic laser sources in order to investigate the impact of externally induced photocurrents of different intensity upon the radiative signal of each junction.

Abstract: It is known that the properly textured ZnO film can increase light-scattering and therefore improves light-trapping inside the solar cells, resulting in increased Jsc value and consequently solar cell efficiency. Using a low cost solution-based electrochemical deposition, we have developed a ZnO thin film deposition process that offers fine-control of crystal orientation, surface morphology and texture by tuning an additive concentration. Using the optimized textured ZnO films, we have achieved superior light trapping performance especially in long wavelength spectrum (λ>610nm) comparing to the vacuum sputtered ZnO. Using single junction a-SiGe:H and multi-junction a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/a-SiGe:H thin film solar cells, high quantum efficiency (current density) and solar cell efficiencies are attained. It demonstrates that the low cost electrochemical ZnO deposition is an effective method to prepare high quality ZnO film for solar cells.

Abstract: Ubiquitin is a small modifier protein that conjugates on lysine (Lys) residues of substrates, and it can be targeted by another ubiquitin molecule to form chains through conjugation on the intrinsic Lys residues and methionine (Met) 1 residue. Ubiquitination of substrates by such chains determines the fate of substrates, thereby influencing various biological processes. In this chapter, we focus on apoptosis with an emphasis on the regulation by ubiquitination. The signal transduction of apoptosis is governed not only by the classical function of ubiquitin, which is proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates, but also by the apoptosis signaling complex formation guided by different types of ubiquitin chains. Ubiquitinations of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins are tightly regulated by particular sets of enzymes, such as ubiquitin E3 ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs). We further discuss ubiquitination in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway as an example for the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of apoptosis and cell survival.

Abstract: To fill in the gap of experimental studies on the adhesion and mechanical properties of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films, mechanical measurements such as nano-indentation and scratch were performed on CZTSSe films prepared from metallic and partially sulfurized precursors on Mo substrates. Surprisingly and interestingly, obviously better film adhesion and elastic modulus values close to the theoretical predictions were achieved in the sample prepared using sulfur contained precursors, in comparison with the samples prepared using metallic precursors. Detailed characterization and analysis reveal that this better performance is attributed to a significantly improved CZTSSe/Mo interface when sulfur contained precursors are used. Mechanisms of the impacts of sulfur incorporation on the adhesion and mechanical properties of CZTSSe films and the suppression of the growth of unwanted Mo(S,Se)2 are analyzed and discussed, for potentially benefiting device performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine photoluminescence spectra (PL) of Cu2ZnSnSe4/CdS/ZnO solar cells, based on an absorber layer fabricated by selenization of sputtered Cu, Zn, Sn multilayers, via temperature-dependent and illumination power-dependent measurements. We observe anomalous emission behavior: the PL peak initially decreases with increasing temperature (red shift) in the temperature range 10–60K, followed by a blue shift at higher temperature in the range 60–180K. A recombination model is proposed that is able to explain both temperature dependent PL as well as power-dependent PL. The important aspect of the proposed model is taking into account the presence of strong potential fluctuations in the absorber layer, which can also contribute to the low Voc values generally observed in Cu2ZnSnSe4, based solar cells.

Abstract: We report manufacture of fully printed and coated polymer solar cells on a small scale roll-to-roll coater representing the intermediate scale between laboratory and pilot scale. We highlight the enormous span in scale between the laboratory scale and the intended industrial scale by a factor of >100.000 and detail how this enormous scale must be covered by equipment that follow the scale. Especially the intermediate scale between equipment that can fit inside a fume cupboard and the typical pilot equipment with a footprint having the size of a large room presents a challenge that comprises some of the most critical steps in the scaling process. We describe the development of such a machine that comprise web guiding, tension control and surface treatment in a compact desk size that is easily moved around and also detail the development of a small cassette based flexographic unit for back electrode printing that is parsimonious in terms of ink usage and more gentle than laboratory scale flexo units where the foil transport is either driven by the flexo unit or the flexo unit is driven by the foil transport. We demonstrate fully operational flexible polymer solar cell manufacture using this new roll and roll-to-roll (R3) approach and compare with the existing methods.

Abstract: This article presents results from investigating the impact of varying spectral irradiance on the performance of different PV technologies. Relative gains or losses were quantified for five typical PV technologies with different band gaps and, consequently, different spectral responses using spectral irradiance measured from 01.06.2010 to 31.12.2013 in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. With the spectrally resolved data, the effectively available annual irradiation per technology was calculated using the spectral mismatch factor, and compared to the total broadband irradiation measured by a pyranometer. The process used to calculate the spectral impact produces a result that can directly be used to estimate the effectively available irradiation for yield prediction or energy rating. The annual spectral impact was +3.4% for amorphous silicon, +2.4% for cadmium telluride, +1.4% for crystalline silicon, +1.1% for high-efficiency crystalline silicon and +0.6% for small-band-gap CIGS. Technologies with a large band gap exhibited spectral gains in summer and spectral losses in winter, and vice versa for small-band-gap technologies. The results are discussed and interpreted with consideration to uncertainties and results published so far. Furthermore, it was investigated in how far average photon energy (APE) can be used as a quantitative indicator for the spectral impact. In summary, it was found that using APE does not present actual advantages over using the spectral mismatch factor, and should rather be used for qualitative than for quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: An urgent challenge to popularize diamond-wire-sawn single-crystalline silicon (DWS sc-Si) wafers to PV industry is to develop a proper texture process, specially eliminating its severe saw marks and forming uniform pyramid texture. Using a simple pre-polishing step with TMAH plus routine texture process, the saw marks as well as amorphous silicon layer are removed effectively, thus benefiting the formation of a random pyramid structure on DWS sc-Si wafers, and the texturing mechanism beyond was discussed. With new texture surface, DWS sc-Si cells demonstrated similar reflection ~5% and same efficiency level ~19.15% to the traditional multi-wire-slurry-sawn solar cells. The techniques present in this article can be easily scaled up in PV industry.

Abstract: In ordinary polymer solar cells, the short exciton diffusion length causes increasing probability of electron–hole recombination as the active layer thickness exceeds the diffusion length. Hence, the diffusion sets a thickness limitation of the active layer. ZnO nanorods have been used to provide an advantage of electronic path, making it possible to increase the effective thickness of the active layer. However general hydrothermal treatment has a limitation of the ZnO nanorod length because the nanorods accelerate their growth speed horizontally after growing over a period of time, leading to the reduction of space to be filled with the organic light absorber. Thus, in this work, two-growth ZnO nanorods are employed to overcome the above limitation. The first growth process is for defining nanorod density, while the second process is to increase the length without much expansion of the rod size. This allows for elastically tuning the morphology between the active layer and the ZnO electron transport layer to achieve deeper and superior infiltration of organic light absorber. Consequently, this improves the performance of the device. The power conversion efficiencies of devices in PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM and PTB7/PC71BM are then enhanced from 5.40% to 7.80% and 7.24% to 8.01%, respectively.

Abstract: Silicon carbide/silicon rich carbide multilayers, aimed at the formation of silicon nanodots for photovoltaic applications, have been studied. The electrical properties have been investigated at the nano-scale by conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM) and at macro-scale by temperature dependent conductivity measurements. The mixture is composed of highly conductive Si nanoclusters and moderately conductive SiC nanoclusters in a disordered matrix. The conduction mechanism takes place via band states induced by the disorder at the interface between nanodot clusters. Structural properties have been extracted by optical spectroscopy analyses. The results contribute to the understanding of the microscopical electronic mechanisms of the composite material, which is a candidate for third generation photovoltaics.

Abstract: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers with several Ga/III, Ga/(In+Ga) ratio, profiles were deposited by the so-called “multi layer precursor method” consisting of Ga-Se/In-Se/Cu-Se stacks. The effects of average Ga/III ratios and back slopes of the Ga/III profiles on the photovoltaic performance were investigated. The optimum average Ga/III ratio of approximately 0.36 leads to the appropriate average band-gap energy as well as sufficiently long carrier lifetime in CIGS absorber, thus enhancing open-circuit voltage. In addition, the back slope of 0.50μm−1, defined as the ratio of the change in Ga/III ratio to the change in the depth range from 1 to 2μm from CIGS surface, induces back surface field of 0.34V/μm, thereby increasing short-circuit current density. Ultimately, the CIGS absorber on flexible stainless steel substrate with the double graded Ga/III profile (the average Ga/III of 0.36 and the back slope of 0.50μm−1) was fabricated by the multi layer precursor method. This results in the 14.36%-efficient CIGS solar cell on the flexible substrate without an anti-reflective layer.

Abstract: Fungal β-d-glucans of the (1→3)-type are known to exhibit direct antitumor effects, and can also indirectly decrease tumor proliferation through immunomodulatory responses. The underlying molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing tumor formation, however, are not well understood. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative role and mechanism of action of three different fungal exocellular β-glucans in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The β-glucans were obtained from Botryosphaeria rhodina MAMB-05 [two botryosphaerans; (1→3)(1→6)-β-d-glucan; one produced on glucose, the other on fructose] and Lasiodiplodia theobromae MMPI [lasiodiplodan; (1→6)-β-d-glucan, produced on glucose]. Using the cell proliferation-MTT assay, we showed that the β-glucans exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity (IC50, 100μg/ml). Markers of cell cycle, apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress were analyzed using flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blotting. Exposure to β-glucans increased apoptosis, necrosis, oxidative stress, mRNA expression of p53, p27 and Bax; the activity of AMP-activated protein-kinase, Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a, Bax and caspase-3; and decreased the activity of p70S6K in MCF-7 cells. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the fungal β-glucans increased oxidative stress, which was associated with reduced cell viability. We showed that these β-glucans exhibited an antiproliferative effect that was associated with apoptosis, necrosis and oxidative stress. This study demonstrated for the first time that the apoptosis induced by β-glucans was mediated by AMP-activated protein-kinase and Forkhead transcription factor, FOXO3a. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into their antiproliferative roles, and compelling evidence that these β-glucans possess a broad range of biomodulatory properties that may prove useful in cancer treatment.

Abstract: In many cases light harvesting nanomaterials are commonly applied as photovoltaics as well as photocatalyst materials. However, such a dual use depends critically on the charge dynamics across the involved nanostructured interface. Here, we have investigated PbS-ZnO light harvesting assemblies (LHAs) that can lead to efficient photovoltaics. In contrast, their photocatalytic properties remain poor. We demonstrate that fundamental, ultrafast photoinduced charge separation and charge recombination processes at the semiconductor-semiconductor interface are key factors for the dual application of LHAs. In the course of our investigation we have synthesized and characterized the PbS-ZnO LHAs using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. Picosecond-resolved photoluminescence study has been employed to investigate the ultrafast interfacial charge transfer dynamics within the LHA upon photoexcitation. Picosecond-resolved PL-quenching of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) show Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) from donor ZnO NPs to the acceptor PbS quantum dots (QDs) and the latter has been employed to confirm the proximity of PbS to the host ZnO with molecular resolution. The photocatalytic activity of PbS−ZnO LHAs is probed by monitoring the photoreduction of the test contaminant methylene blue (MB) and correlated with ultrafast spectroscopic studies on LHAs. This allows a conclusion on the role of ultrafast electron shuttling across the interface in making the electron unavailable for a reduction of MB. The prospective use of the LHAs in photovoltaics is investigated by photoelectrochemical studies where working electrodes of PbS-ZnO LHAs show higher photocurrents than that of bare ZnO NPs. This clearly indicates that the presence of an Indiumtinoxide (ITO) substrate provides directionality to the shuttling electrons at the PbS-ZnO interface. The exploration of interfacial carrier dynamics in PbS-ZnO LHAs will be helpful in improving the design and efficiency of future solar energy harvesting devices.

Abstract: We have investigated effects of formation of an ultrathin silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer using the nitric acid oxidation of Si (NAOS) method and the subsequent ammonia (NH3) plasma treatment on single crystalline Si solar cell characteristics and the surface chemical structures, respectively. The NAOS SiO2 layer formed between Si and silicon nitride (SiN) improves the conversion efficiencies from 17.2 to 18.9% for n-Si-based solar cells, and from 16.6 to 17.5% for p-Si-based solar cells. The improvement is attributed to elimination of interface states, but not to fixed charges because the flat band-voltage of the <Al/SiN/Si> MIS diodes isn’t largely changed by formation of a NAOS SiO2 layer at the SiN/Si interface. The minority carrier lifetime of the NAOS SiO2/p-Si structure is greatly improved from 12 to 45μs (or 35μs) by heat treatment in oxygen at 800°C (or 600°C). In the absence of a NAOS SiO2 layer, the NH3 plasma treatment forms an SiN layer of 0.3nm thickness on the Si surface. In the presence of a NAOS SiO2 layer, on the other hand, only 0.1 monolayer of SiN is formed on the surface, and at the Si interface, silicon oxynitride species is produced. It is concluded that the NAOS SiO2 layer prevents direct nitridation of Si substrates, and thus avoids introduction of plasma damage in Si.

Abstract: Low bandgap Si(1−x)Ge(x) solar cells are designed, fabricated, characterized and analyzed for the purpose of acting as the bottom cell in a GaAsP–SiGe tandem solar cell. The development of the SiGe cell under a GaAsP cell can lead to a 34% relative increase in efficiency over that of a silicon solar cell. This work focuses on making a SiGe bottom cell that can generate 21mA/cm2 of short circuit current (Jsc) at 1Sun from photons beyond 780nm and with a 450mV band gap–voltage offset (Woc) under 20Suns illumination. Numerical and analytical methods are introduced to demonstrate the SiGe solar cells׳ performance limits and to examine the trade-offs among I–V performance, cell structure and material composition. Material compositions are confirmed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical capacitance voltage profiling (ECV). First principles analysis shows that a Si.15Ge.85 cell with a 5µm base can produce the expected current and an efficiency of 8.8% under 20Suns. By increasing base doping, we achieve a Woc of 435mV under 20Suns with a Si.18Ge.82 cell. The best 1Sun short circuit current measured from a Si.12Ge.88 cell at wavelengths beyond 780nm without anti-reflection coating, back surface reflector, or back texturing is 12.9mA/cm2. Adding a back surface field to the structure will lead to a higher Voc and lower Woc. Implementing light trapping with a higher base angle of pyramids can lead to the target Jsc of 21mA/cm2.

Abstract: Quantum-scale semiconductor nanoparticles offer unique, size-dependent optical and electronic properties of import to enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The present study addresses the integration of CdTe nanocrystal assemblies, used as spectral sensitizers, into thin film photovoltaic heterojunction devices. CdTe nanocrystals, embedded in an electrically active ZnO matrix, form a nanocomposite offering control of both spectral absorption and photocarrier transport behavior through the manipulation of nanophase assembly (ensemble effects). A sequential RF-magnetron sputter deposition technique affords the control of semiconductor nanophase spatial distribution relative to the heterojunction plane in a hybrid, ZnO–P3HT test structure. Energy conversion performance, (J–V and quantum efficiency (QE) response) was examined as a function of the location of the CdTe nanophase absorber region using both 1-D device modeling (SCAPS) and the experimental examination of analogous P3HT–ZnO based hybrid thin film devices. Enhancement in simulated QE over a spectral range consistent with the absorption region of the CdTe nanophase (i.e. 400–475nm) is confirmed in the experimentally determined external quantum efficiency (EQE). Moreover, a trend of decreasing efficiency in this spectral range with increasing separation between the CdTe nanophase region and the heterojunction plane is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of carrier scattering/recombination length mitigating the successful transport of photocarriers across the junction.

Abstract: In this work, Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films were prepared using the sol–gel dip coating method and the effects of film thickness (230–480nm), heating temperature (400–600°C) and atmosphere (air/argon) on the system structural and opto-electronic performances were investigated. The results show that highly c-axis oriented crystals could be easily formed in GZO coatings, which origins from a preferred nucleation and gets fully developed during the structure evolution. The increase of film thickness prolongs the sol–gel preheating process and promotes nucleation, resulting in a more crystalline film. Higher temperature annealing (600°C) in air could degrade the Ga doping efficiency and decrease the carrier concentration, but the enlarged grain size helps enhance the carrier mobility and improve the film conductivity. Under the modified annealing process in argon, favorable carrier density (3.376×1019cm−3) and mobility (15.74cm2(Vs)−1) can be obtained at the same time, resulting a minimum film resistivity of 1.18×10−2Ωcm. The studied GZO coatings keep transparent in the visible and near infrared range, leading to high emissivity values (>0.738). We firstly prove that the carrier concentration could play a more dominant role than its mobility in determining the thermal emittance performance of thin films.

Abstract: Silicon nanocrystals show a significant shift between the strong absorption in the blue–ultraviolet region and their characteristic red–near-infrared emission as well as space separated-quantum cutting when short wavelength photons are absorbed. These two effects can be used to increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. We fabricated high quality interdigitated back-contact crystalline silicon solar cells in an industrial pilot line and coated them with optimized silicon nanocrystals layers in a cost effective way. Here we demonstrate an increase of 0.8% of the power conversion efficiency of the interdigitated back-contact cell by the silicon nanocrystals layer. In addition, we prove that this increase is due to a combination of a better surface passivation, a better optical coating, and of the luminescent downshifting effect. Moreover we demonstrated that the engineering of the local density of photon states, thanks to the Purcell effect, is instrumental in order to exploit this effect.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are able to melt and solidify at a certain temperature with a high heat of fusion. These promising functional materials for acting as energy as latent heat storage units have one major problem, leakage of the PCMs when molten. Polymer/phase change material (PCM) blends were investigated as a possible solution of PCM leakage. In this research, paraffin was used as the PCM and three types polyethylene (PE) were used as the structural matrix. To investigate the morphology of PE/ paraffin blends and evaluate the influence on blend behavior, paraffin was blended with either high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), or linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) using a parallel co-rotating twin screw extruder. Chloroform extraction was utilized to estimate the maximum amount of paraffin able to be released by the PE network at equilibrium. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of chloroform-extracted samples were collected to investigate the blend structure. Thermal transition temperatures and crystallinity of components in the blends were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) was used to investigate crystal perfection changes of the polyethylenes before and after blending with paraffin. Paraffin leakage of the blends was investigated by accelerated degradation test in an oven at 60°C. The leakage behavior was analyzed by Korsmeyer–Peppas equation to determine the underlying mechanisms. Chloroform extraction indicated that almost all the paraffin would leak out from the blends in the long run. A co-continuous structure of the blends was evident from the chloroform extraction and subsequent SEM images. While this co-continuous structure controlled leakage behavior, it had little influence on paraffin thermal transition temperatures and crystallinity based on DSC study. In contrast, PE crystal perfection decreased with paraffin level as evident in POM images. This structure resulted in leakage of paraffin in all formulations.

Abstract: The combination of a phase change material (PCM) with expanded graphite (EG) is a simple and effective way to obtain a form-stable composite PCM with relatively high latent heat and enhanced thermal conductivity. In this paper, aiming at developing a high-performance PCM for medium-temperature latent heat storage applications, RT100, a mixture of paraffinic hydrocarbons with a melting point of around 100°C, has been selected as the PCM to prepare a novel EG-based composite. It is shown that the RT100/EG composite containing 80wt% RT100 is a form-stable PCM. The form-stable RT100/EG composite PCM powders can be compressed into round blocks by dry pressing. All the RT100/EG composite PCM round blocks have much higher thermal conductivity than RT100, and their thermal conductivity linearly increases with the packing density. The thermal conductivity of composite PCM round blocks maintain even in the melting process. Further, the RT100/EG composite PCM shows excellent photo-thermal and direct thermal storage/release performance in simulative condition. Finally, the 200 heating–cooling cycles test along with the structure and thermal property characterizations indicates that the RT100/EG composite PCM has excellent structure stability and good thermal reliability. As a result, the RT100/EG composite PCM with excellent structure stability, good thermal reliability, good formability, enhanced thermal conductivity, excellent photo-thermal performance and good thermal storage/release capacity shows great potential for use in medium-temperature thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Bio-based PCMs are made from underused feedstock, such as soybean oil, and are significantly less flammable than paraffins. In this study, Bio-based PCMs were prepared with silica fume through a vacuum impregnation process. Silica fume is a mineral admixture product with an impermeable pore structure, and it is one of the most feasible candidates for use as economical, light-weight thermal energy storage materials for buildings [15], [16]. We also used exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP) to improve the thermal conductivity because PCMs have a low thermal conductivity. The vacuum impregnation process that was used in this study guarantees that the Bio-based PCM composites can store heat after incorporation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermo gravimetric analyses (TGA), and TCi analysis were then carried out to determine the characteristics of the Bio-based PCM and Bio-based PCM composites.

Abstract: CdS–CdSe and CdS–CdTe core–shell quantum dots sensitized TiO2 nanotube array solar cells have been controllably prepared based on the anion exchange method using CdS quantum dots on the TiO2 NTs as sacrificial templates. The formation of CdS–CdSe and CdS–CdTe core–shell quantum dots on the upper and inner surface of the TiO2 NTs was confirmed by scanning electron (SEM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEM). These two photoelectrodes exhibit significant improvement of optical and electrochemical properties. Although TiO2 NTs/CdS–CdTe with a more favorable visible light activity, TiO2 NTs/CdS–CdSe have higher photostability and photoelectrochemical performance.

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in plasmon-induced enhancement of solar cells and more recently in the direct generation of photocurrent using noble metal nanoparticles with their Localised Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) in the visual part of the spectrum. In this paper we report broadband plasmon photocurrent generation using novel Au nanoparticle incorporated mesoporous TiO2 nanotube electrodes. Plasmonic induced photocurrent due to hot electrons is observed over a broad wavelength range (~500 to 1000nm). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements undertaken showed a maximum photocurrent enhancement of 200 fold around 700–730nm wavelength.

Abstract: Background
Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus in the world with infection rate up to 60%, for which liver fibrosis or hepatic carcinoma is the final outcome. Stem cell therapy provides a new hope for hepatic repair instead of traditional treatment, liver transplantation, as it is safer, gives long term engraftment and avoid expensive immunosuppressive drugs and unexpected hazardous effects.
Aim
This work aimed at determining the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in hepatic repair as a new line of therapy for liver fibrosis.
Methods
33 female albino rats were divided into three groups: Group I: 10 rats injected subcutaneously with olive oil, Group II: 13 rats injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and Group III: 10 rats injected with CCl4 then bone marrow derived MSC from male rats. Blood and liver tissue samples were taken from all rats for biochemical and histological study.
Results
Liver functions for group II rats showed significant deterioration in response to CCl4 in addition to significant histological changes in liver lobules and portal areas. Those parameters tend to be normal in MSC-treated group. Group III rats revealed normalized liver function and histological picture. Meanwhile, most of the pathological lesions were still detected in rats of second group.
Conclusion
Undifferentiated MSCs have the ability to ameliorate CCl4 induced liver injury in albino rats in terms of liver functions and histological features. So, stem cell therapy can be considered clinically to offer a hope for patients suffering from liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Butyrate regulates multiple host cellular events including the cell cycle; however, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which butyrate induces a global down-regulation of the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle. Here, we demonstrate that treating HEK293T cells and the non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A549 with a high concentration of sodium butyrate reduces cyclin B1 expression. The underlying mechanism is related to the destabilization of its mRNA by tristetraprolin, which is up-regulated in response to sodium butyrate. Specifically, the sodium butyrate stimulation reduces the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 and, conversely, upregulates tristetraprolin expression. Importantly, the overexpression of tristetraprolin in HEK293T decreases the mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1; in contrast, knockdown of tristetraprolin mediated by small interfering RNA increases its expression in response to sodium butyrate treatment for both HEK293T and A549 cells. Furthermore, results from luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation indicate that sodium butyrate accelerates 3′ UTR-dependent cyclin B1 decay by enhancing the binding of tristetraprolin to the 3′ untranslated region of cyclin B1. Surprisingly, the overexpression of tristetraprolin prevents the formation of processing bodies, and the siRNA-mediated silencing of EDC4 does not restore the sodium butyrate-induced reduction of cyclin B1 expression. Thus, we confirm that NaBu regulates ZFP36-mediated cyclin B1 expression in a manner that is independent of the formation of P-bodies. The above findings disclose a novel mechanism of sodium butyrate-mediated gene expression regulation and might benefit its application in tumor treatment.

Abstract: During the industrial bioethanol fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are often stressed by bacterial contaminants, especially lactic acid bacteria. Generally, lactic acid bacteria contamination can inhibit S. cerevisiae cell growth through secreting lactic acid and competing with yeast cells for micronutrients and living space. However, whether are there still any other influences of lactic acid bacteria on yeast or not? In this study, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 was co-cultivated with S. cerevisiae S288c to mimic the L. plantarum contamination in industrial bioethanol fermentation. The contaminative L. plantarum-associated expression changes of genes involved in carbohydrate and energy related metabolisms in S. cerevisiae cells were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the influence of L. plantarum on carbon source utilization and energy related metabolism in yeast cells during bioethanol fermentation. Contaminative L. plantarum influenced the expression of most of genes which are responsible for encoding key enzymes involved in glucose related metabolisms in S. cerevisiae. Specific for, contaminated L. plantarum inhibited EMP pathway but promoted TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle, HMP, glycerol synthesis pathway, and redox pathway in S. cerevisiae cells. In the presence of L. plantarum, the carbon flux in S. cerevisiae cells was redistributed from fermentation to respiratory and more reducing power was produced to deal with the excess NADH. Moreover, L. plantarum contamination might confer higher ethanol tolerance to yeast cells through promoting accumulation of glycerol. These results also highlighted our knowledge about relationship between contaminative lactic acid bacteria and S. cerevisiae during bioethanol fermentation.

Abstract: Bone marrow (BM) contains hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and nonhematopoietic cells. HSCs give rise to all types of mature blood cells, while the nonhematopoietic component includes osteoblasts/osteoclasts, endothelial cells (ECs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These cells form specialized “niches” which are close to the vasculature (“vascular niche”) or to the endosteum (“osteoblast niche”). The “vascular niche”, rich in blood vessels where ECs and mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells), create a microenvironment affecting the behavior of several stem and progenitor cells. The vessel wall acts as an independent niche for the recruitment of EPCs and MSCs. This chapter will focus on the description of the role of BM niches in the control of angiogenesis occurring during multiple myeloma progression.

Residues required for phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α under diverse stress conditions are divergent between yeast and human,

Abstract: PERK, PKR, HRI and GCN2 are the four mammalian kinases that phosphorylate the α subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) on Ser51. This phosphorylation event is conserved among many species and attenuates protein synthesis in response to diverse stress conditions. In contrast, Saccharmyces cerevisiae expresses only the GCN2 kinase. It was demonstrated previously in S. cerevisiae that single point mutations in eIF2α’s N-terminus severely impaired phosphorylation at Ser51. To assess whether similar recognition patterns are present in mammalian eIF2α, we expressed human eIF2α’s with these mutations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and assessed their phosphorylation under diverse stress conditions. Some of the mutations prevented the stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α by all mammalian kinases, thus defining amino acid residues in eIF2α (Gly 30, Leu 50, and Asp 83) that are required for substrate recognition. We also identified residues that were less critical or not required for recognition by the mammalian kinases (Ala 31, Met 44, Lys 79, and Tyr 81), even though they were essential for recognition of the yeast eIF2α by GCN2. We propose that mammalian eIF2α kinases evolved to maximize their interactions with the evolutionarily conserved Ser51 residue of eIF2α in response to diverse stress conditions, thus adding to the complex signaling pathways that mammalian cells have over simpler organisms.

A role for dZIP89B in Drosophila dietary zinc uptake reveals additional complexity in the zinc absorption process,

Abstract: Dietary zinc is the principal source of zinc in eukaryotes, with its uptake and distribution controlled by a complex network of numerous membrane-spanning transport proteins. Dietary absorption is achieved by members of the SLC39A (ZIP) gene family, which encode proteins that are generally responsible for the movement of zinc into the cytosol. ZIP4 is thought to be the primary mammalian zinc uptake gene in the small intestine, with mutations in this gene causing the zinc deficiency disease Acrodermatitis enteropathica. In Drosophila, dual knockdown of the major dietary zinc uptake genes dZIP42C.1 (dZIP1) and dZIP42C.2 (dZIP2) results in a severe sensitivity to zinc-deficient media. However, the symptoms associated with ZIP4 loss can be reversed by zinc supplementation and dZIP42C.1 and 2 knockdown has minimal effect under normal dietary conditions, suggesting that additional pathways for zinc absorption exist in both mammals and flies. This study provides evidence that dZIP89B is an ideal candidate for this role in Drosophila, encoding a low-affinity zinc uptake transporter active in the posterior midgut. Flies lacking dZIP89B, while viable and apparently healthy, show indications of low midgut zinc levels, including reduced metallothionein B expression and compensatory up-regulation of dZIP42C.1 and 2. Furthermore dZIP89B mutants display a dramatic resistance to toxic dietary zinc levels which is abrogated by midgut-specific restoration of dZIP89B activity. We postulate that dZIP89B works in concert with the closely related dZIP42C.1 and 2 to ensure optimal zinc absorption under a range of dietary conditions.

Abstract: Mammalian oocytes and embryos are exquisitely sensitive to a wide range of insults related to physical stress, chemical exposure, and exposures to adverse maternal nutrition or health status. Although cells manifest specific responses to various stressors, many of these stressors intersect at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where disruptions in protein folding and production of reactive oxygen species initiate downstream signaling events. These signals modulate mRNA translation and gene transcription, leading to recovery, activation of autophagy, or with severe and prolonged stress, apoptosis. ER stress signaling has recently come to the fore as a major contributor to embryo demise. Accordingly, agents that modulate or inhibit ER stress signaling have yielded beneficial effects on embryo survival and long-term developmental potential. We review here the mechanisms of ER stress signaling, their connections to mammalian oocytes and embryos, and the promising indications that interventions in this pathway may provide new opportunities for improving mammalian reproduction and health.

Threonine 34 phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 facilitates dissociation of Akt from the plasma membrane,

Abstract: Akt is a key mediator of cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. After translocation to the membrane and phosphorylation at T308 and S473, the activated Akt dissociates from the plasma membrane to cytoplasm, which is an important step to phosphorylate its downstream targets. In addition to its central role in regulating the kinase activity, phosphorylation of T308 in the kinase loop has been reported to be necessary for this dissociation process. However, it is not clear whether the membrane detachment requires further mechanisms. In the present report, we demonstrate that membrane dissociation of Akt requires phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) which directly phosphorylates not only T308 but also T34 in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Like T308, T34 was phosphorylated in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate- and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of T34 also occurred in cells following growth factor stimulation, concurrently with T308 phosphorylation. Moreover, when T34 was mutated to aspartic acid (T34D) to mimic its phosphorylation, Akt-membrane association assessed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was significantly reduced. In cells, this mutation impaired the IGF-induced Akt membrane translocation and subsequent phosphorylation at T308 and S473. Taken together, our results demonstrate that T34 phosphorylation by PDK1 promotes the membrane dissociation of activated Akt for its downstream action through attenuating membrane binding affinity. This membrane dissociation mechanism offers a new insight for Akt activation process and provides a potential new target for controlling the Akt-dependent cellular processes.

Abstract: Human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1) is a member of the p130Cas family of docking proteins involved in integrin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization associated with cell migration. Elevated expression of HEF1 promotes invasion and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. To date, little is known on its role in CRC tumor progression. HEF1 is phosphorylated on several Ser/Thr residues but the effects of these post-translational modifications on the functions of HEF1 are poorly understood. In this manuscript, we investigated the role of HEF1 in migration of colorectal adeno-carcinoma cells. First, we showed that overexpression of HEF1 in colo-carcinoma cell line HCT116 increases cell migration. Moreover, in these cells, HEF1 increases Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and 925. We then showed that HEF1 mutation on Ser-369 enhances HEF1-induced migration and FAK phosphorylation as a result of protein stabilization. We also, for the first time characterized a functional mutation of HEF1 on Arg-367 which mimics the effect of Ser-369 to Ala mutation. Finally through mass spectrometry experiments, we identified BCAR3 as an essential interactor and mediator of HEF1-induced migration. We demonstrated that single amino acid mutations that prevent formation of the HEF1-BCAR3 complex impair HEF1-mediated migration. Therefore, amino-acid substitutions that impede Ser-369 phosphorylation stabilize HEF1 which increases the migration of CRC cells and this latter effect requires the interaction of HEF1 with the NSP family adaptor protein BCAR3. Collectively, these data reveal the importance of HEF1 expression level in cancer cell motility and then support the utilization of HEF1 as a biomarker of tumor progression.

Abstract: A laboratory method to simulate natural exposure of roofing materials has been reported in a companion article. In the current article, we describe the results of an international, nine-participant interlaboratory study (ILS) conducted in accordance with ASTM Standard E691-09 to establish the precision and reproducibility of this protocol. The accelerated soiling and weathering method was applied four times by each laboratory to replicate coupons of 12 products representing a wide variety of roofing categories (single-ply membrane, factory-applied coating (on metal), bare metal, field-applied coating, asphalt shingle, modified-bitumen cap sheet, clay tile, and concrete tile). Participants reported initial and laboratory-aged values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Measured solar reflectances were consistent within and across eight of the nine participating laboratories. Measured thermal emittances reported by six participants exhibited comparable consistency. For solar reflectance, the accelerated aging method is both repeatable and reproducible within an acceptable range of standard deviations: the repeatability standard deviation sr ranged from 0.008 to 0.015 (relative standard deviation of 1.2–2.1%) and the reproducibility standard deviation sR ranged from 0.022 to 0.036 (relative standard deviation of 3.2–5.8%). The ILS confirmed that the accelerated aging method can be reproduced by multiple independent laboratories with acceptable precision. This study supports the adoption of the accelerated aging practice to speed the evaluation and performance rating of new cool roofing materials.

Abstract: The success of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as a future energy source is entirely dependent on the cost of the electricity produced by the modules. This study provides the first commercial scale levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) estimates for OPVs by integrating OPV-specific measured and calculated data into the estimates. The impacts of physical and financial variables are also investigated. The study shows that OPVs will become equivalently priced with current conventional solar technologies when efficiencies of 2% and lifetimes of three years are achieved. At efficiencies of 5% and lifetimes of 3–5 years the LCOE for OPVs will be competitive with that of current coal-based electricity generation.

Abstract: Aluminum local back surface field (Al-LBSF) silicon wafer solar cells are currently intensively investigated in the photovoltaic community and are expected to enter mass production in the near future. In this work we show that this solar cell architecture can pose significant challenges in the determination of the series resistance at the maximum power point. We also show that some of the traditional methods for extracting the series resistance of these cells result in a severe underestimation, due to injection dependent saturation current densities. By using a combination of electro- and photo-luminescence images, we demonstrate that the series resistance of Al-LBSF solar cells can be accurately determined.

Abstract: Templated sol gel chemistry provides a versatile approach to introduce order and porosity into nanostructured materials. However conventional evaporation induced self assembly techniques are not easily scaled to produce films with sufficient thickness over large areas at the throughput required by electrochromic windows. Here we demonstrate that the principles of sol gel chemistry may be deployed using ultrasonic spray deposition (USD) for scalable synthesis of nanocrystalline WO3 films with unrivaled electrochromic performance. Systematic manipulation of sol chemistry enabled the production of mesoporous films with high specific surface area (>100m2/g), mean pore sizes of ~5nm, and narrow pore size distributions. Film thickness is found to be proportional to the sol concentration and number of spray passes, and various combinations are shown to produce films capable of modulating >98% of incident solar radiation in the visible spectrum (450–900nm). Elimination of haze enables full transmission in the bleached state, while the broadband coloration is attributed to the exceptionally high charge density (>120mC/cm2). The materials have good switching speeds which improve with specific surface area, and the long term durability is promising.

Abstract: Hybrid transparent conductive films (TCFs) based on indium tin oxide (ITO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared through a sol–gel dip coating method. The effect of CNT diameter on optoelectrical properties of TCF is investigated. The surface roughness and grain size are decreased and the optical transmittance is increased with CNT diameter. The existence of bundles in smaller CNTs is the main reason for lower transmittance in these samples. In terms of electrical resistivity, the large diameter CNT incorporated ITO film shows lower sheet resistance than bare ITO film at high enough film thicknesses. It seems that the large diameter CNT incorporation in ITO matrix can remarkably reduce the microcrack formation, especially at higher thicknesses, and act as nanobridges when microcracks are formed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of ITO film to thermal cycling is dramatically enhanced with these CNTs. In addition, the figure of merit of ITO film is considerably improved with large diameter CNT incorporation.
