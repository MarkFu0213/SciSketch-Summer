Abstract: The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) has been implicated with mitochondrial morphology, function, and cell proliferation. Changes in CL are often paralleled by changes in the lipid environment of mitochondria that may contribute to mitochondrial function and proliferation. This study aimed to separate the effects of CL content and CL composition from cellular free fatty acid distribution on bioenergetics and proliferation in C6 glioma cells. To this end, cardiolipin synthase and the CL remodelling enzyme, tafazzin, were knocked-down by siRNA in C6 cells. After 72 h of cultivation, we analysed CL composition by means of LC/MS/MS, distribution of cellular fatty acids by means of gas chromatography, and determined oxygen consumption and proliferation. Knock-down of cardiolipin synthase affected the cellular CL content in the presence of linoleic acid (LA) in the culture medium. Knock-down of tafazzin had no consequence with respect to the pattern of cellular fatty acids but caused a decrease in cell proliferation. It significantly changed the distribution of molecular CL species, increased CL content, decreased oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation when cultured in the presence of linoleic acid (LA). The addition of linoleic acid to the culture medium caused significant changes in the pattern of cellular fatty acids and the composition of molecular CL species. These data suggest that tafazzin is required for efficient bioenergetics and for proliferation of glioma cells. Supplementation of fatty acids can be a powerful tool to direct specific changes in these parameters.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as an important gasotransmitter analogous to nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE)-derived H2S is implicated in the regulation of insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, but the involvement of CSE/H2S system in energy homeostasis and fat mass has not been extensively explored. In this study, a potential functional role of the CSE/H2S system in in vitro adipocyte differentiation and in vivo adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism was investigated. CSE expression and H2S production were increased during adipocyte differentiation, and that the pattern of CSE mRNA expression was similar to that of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and δ, two key regulators for adipogenesis. C/EBPβ and γ bind to the CCAAT box in CSE promoter and stimulate CSE gene transcription. H2S induced PPARγ transactivation activity by S-sulfhydrating all the cysteine residues in the DNA binding domain and stimulated adipogenesis. High fat diet-induced fat mass was lost in CSE deficient mice, and exogenously applied H2S promoted fat mass accumulation in fruit flies. In conclusion, CSE/H2S system is essential for adipogenesis and fat mass accumulation through enhancement of PPARγ function in adipocytes. This study suggests that the CSE/H2S system is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity in mice.

Abstract: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might regulate metabolism by lowering endocannabinoid levels. We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24 weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF + F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24 weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5 g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5 g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF + F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF + F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.

Dehydroepiandrosterone reduces accumulation of lipid droplets in primary chicken hepatocytes by biotransformation mediated via the cAMP/PKA-ERK1/2 signaling pathway,

Abstract: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is commonly used as a nutritional supplement to control fat deposition, but the mechanism of this action is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that DHEA increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK). Elevated p-AMPK levels resulted in reduced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, acetyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and enhanced expression of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I, ultimately leading to the reduction of lipid droplet accumulation in primary chicken hepatocytes. We found that DHEA activates the cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate/protein kinase A - extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (cAMP/PKA-ERK1/2) signaling pathway, which regulates the conversion of DHEA into testosterone and estradiol by increasing the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and aromatase protein expression. Importantly, the fat-reducing effects of DHEA are more closely associated with the conversion of DHEA into estradiol than with the action of DHEA itself as an active biomolecule, or to its alternative metabolite, testosterone. Taken together, our results indicate that DHEA is converted into active hormones through activation of the cAMP/PKA-ERK1/2 signaling pathway; the fat-reducing effects of DHEA are achieved through its conversion into estradiol, not testosterone, and not through direct action of DHEA itself, which led to the activation of the p-AMPK in primary chicken hepatocytes. These data provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the action of DHEA in preventing fat deposition, and suggest potential applications for DHEA treatment to control fat deposition or as an agent to treat disorders related to lipid metabolism in animals and humans.

Abstract: The functionality of cellular membranes is critically determined by their lipid composition. Within the endolysosomal system, cholesterol is mainly found in more peripheral compartments. In contrast, cholesterol levels are low in late endosomes/lysosomes (LEL), and the occurrence of enlarged pools of this lipid is commonly linked to endolysosomal dysfunction. Here, we show that Annexin A8 (AnxA8), a member of the annexin family of Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins, participates in the endosomal regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Depletion of AnxA8 caused accumulation of cholesterol in LEL, and pharmacological inhibition of the LEL cholesterol export recruited AnxA8 to the cholesterol-laden LEL. Biophysical analysis revealed that cholesterol enhanced the Ca2+-dependent affinity of AnxA8 to lipid bilayers, and induced positive cooperativity of membrane binding. Our findings identify AnxA8 as a regulator of LEL cholesterol balance and point to altered membrane binding cooperativity induced by aberrant lipid composition in the target membrane as a means to control the demand-driven recruitment of this cytosolic regulatory protein.

Abstract: TALLYHO/Jng (TH) mice reveal hypercholesterolemia at an early age before their plasma glucose levels have increased. The increased plasma cholesterol should be related to bile acids (BAs) metabolism, because cholesterol is the precursor of BAs and BAs change cholesterol metabolism in a feedback manner. We analyzed the BAs pool size, BAs composition, and expression levels of several proteins that have key roles in BAs synthesis, excretion, and reabsorption and compared them to those of C57BL/6 (B6) mice to study BAs metabolism in TH mice. TH mice exhibited an increased total BAs pool size, increased BAs content in the cecum feces, and an increased ratio of muricholic acid (MCA)/cholic acid (CA). The mRNA and protein levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 5 (Abcg5) were elevated in the liver but not in the apical sodium bile acid transporter (Asbt) and organic solute transporters (Osts) in the ileum. These results indicate that synthesis and the excretion of BAs from the liver to the gallbladder might be elevated, but the reabsorption rate of BAs in the ileum might be reduced. The declined expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (Fgfr4) was respectively identified in the ileum and the liver, indicating the disrupted feedback inhibition of Cyp7a1. Consequently, hypercholesterolemia in TH mice might increase the BAs amounts via the interrupted Fxr/Fgf15/Fgfr4-mediated feedback regulation of Cyp7a1.

Abstract: The mitochondrial glycerophospholipid cardiolipin plays important roles in mitochondrial biology. Most notably, cardiolipin directly binds to mitochondrial proteins and helps assemble and stabilize mitochondrial multi-protein complexes. Despite their importance for mitochondrial health, how the proteins involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis are organized and embedded in mitochondrial membranes has not been investigated in detail. Here we show that human PGS1 and CLS1 are constituents of large protein complexes. We show that PGS1 forms oligomers and associates with CLS1 and PTPMT1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we observed well-organized nanoscale structures formed by PGS1. Together with the observation that cardiolipin and CLS1 are not required for PGS1 to assemble in the complex we predict the presence of a PGS1-centered cardiolipin-synthesizing scaffold within the mitochondrial inner membrane. Using an unbiased proteomic approach we found that PGS1 and CLS1 interact with multiple cardiolipin-binding mitochondrial membrane proteins, including prohibitins, stomatin-like protein 2 and the MICOS components MIC60 and MIC19. We further mapped the protein-protein interaction sites between PGS1 and itself, CLS1, MIC60 and PHB. Overall, this study provides evidence for the presence of a cardiolipin synthesis structure that transiently interacts with cardiolipin-dependent protein complexes.

Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica is considered as a promising microbial cell factory for bio-oil production due to its ability to accumulate a large amount of lipid. However, the regulation of lipid metabolism in this oleaginous yeast is elusive. In this study, the MHY1 gene was disrupted, and 43.1% (w/w) intracellular oil based on cell dry weight was obtained from the disruptant M-MHY1, while only 30.2% (w/w) lipid based on cell dry weight was obtained from the reference strain. RNA-seq was then performed to analyze transcriptional changes during lipid biosynthesis after MHY1 gene inactivation. The expression of 1597 genes, accounting for 24.7% of annotated Y. lipolytica genes, changed significantly in the disruptant M-MHY1 during lipid biosynthesis. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that Mhy1p performs multiple functions and participates in a wide variety of biological processes, including lipid, amino acid and nitrogen metabolism. Notably, data analysis revealed increased carbon flux through lipid biosynthesis following MHY1 gene inactivation, accompanied by decreased carbon flux through amino acid biosynthesis. Moreover, Mhy1p regulates the cell cycle, and the cell cycle rate was enhanced in the disruptant M-MHY1. These results suggest that Mhy1p plays critical regulatory roles in diverse aspects of various biological processes, especially in lipid biosynthesis, amino acid and nitrogen metabolism and cell cycle. Our dataset appears to elucidate the crucial role of Mhy1p in lipid biosynthesis and serves as a resource for exploring physiological dimorphic growth in Y. lipolytica.

Abstract: Iron acquisition systems have to be tightly regulated to assure a continuous supply of iron, since it is essential for survival, but simultaneously to prevent iron overload that is toxic to the cells. In budding yeast, the low‑iron sensing transcription factor Aft1p is a master regulator of the iron regulon. Our previous work revealed that bioactive sphingolipids modulate iron homeostasis as yeast cells lacking the sphingomyelinase Isc1p exhibit an upregulation of the iron regulon. In this study, we show that Isc1p impacts on iron accumulation and localization. Notably, Aft1p is activated in isc1Δ cells due to a decrease in its phosphorylation and an increase in its nuclear levels. Consistently, the expression of a phosphomimetic version of Aft1p-S210/S224 that favours its nuclear export abolished iron accumulation in isc1Δ cells. Notably, the Hog1p kinase, homologue of mammalian p38, interacts with and directly phosphorylates Aft1p at residues S210 and S224. However, Hog1p-Aft1p interaction decreases in isc1Δ cells, which likely contributes to Aft1p dephosphorylation and consequently to Aft1p activation and iron overload in isc1Δ cells. These results suggest that alterations in sphingolipid composition in isc1Δ cells may impact on iron homeostasis by disturbing the regulation of Aft1p by Hog1p. To our knowledge, Hog1p is the first kinase reported to directly regulate Aft1p, impacting on iron homeostasis.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are stored up to 35–42days at 2–6°C in blood banks. During storage, the RBC membrane is challenged by energy depletion, decreasing pH, altered cation homeostasis, and oxidative stress, leading to several biochemical and morphological changes in RBCs and to shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the storage medium. These changes are collectively known as RBC storage lesions. EVs accumulate in stored RBC concentrates and are, thus, transfused into patients. The potency of EVs as bioactive effectors is largely acknowledged, and EVs in RBC concentrates are suspected to mediate some adverse effects of transfusion. Several studies have shown accumulation of lipid raft–associated proteins in RBC EVs during storage, whereas a comprehensive phospholipidomic study on RBCs and corresponding EVs during the clinical storage period is lacking. Our mass spectrometric and chromatographic study shows that RBCs maintain their major phospholipid (PL) content well during storage despite abundant vesiculation. The phospholipidomes were largely similar between RBCs and EVs. No accumulation of raft lipids in EVs was seen, suggesting that the primary mechanism of RBC vesiculation during storage might not be raft -based. Nonetheless, a slight tendency of EV PLs for shorter acyl chains was observed.

Abstract: Amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) accumulate in cerebral capillaries indicating a central role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a relationship between apolipoprotein-, cholesterol- and Aβ metabolism is evident, the interconnecting mechanisms operating in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) are poorly understood. ApoJ (clusterin) is present in HDL that regulates cholesterol metabolism which is disturbed in AD. ApoJ levels are increased in AD brains and in plasma of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) patients. ApoJ may bind, prevent fibrillization, and enhance clearance of Aβ. We here define a connection of apoJ and cellular cholesterol homeostasis in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing/Aβ metabolism at the BBB. Silencing of apoJ in primary porcine (p)BCEC decreased intracellular APP and Aβ oligomer levels while the addition of purified apoJ to pBCEC increased intracellular APP and enhanced Aβ clearance across the pBCEC monolayer. Treatment of pBCEC with Aβ(1–40) increased expression of apoJ and receptors involved in amyloid transport including lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [LRP1]. In accordance, cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells isolated from 3×Tg AD mice showed elevated expression levels of apoJ and LRP1 as compared to Non-Tg animals. Treatment of pBCEC with HMGCoA-reductase inhibitor simvastatin markedly increased intracellular and secreted apoJ levels, in parallel increased secreted Aβ oligomers and reduced Aβ uptake and cell-associated Aβ oligomers. Simvastatin effects on apoJ, APP processing, and LRP1 expression in BCEC were confirmed in the mouse model. We suggest a close and complex interaction of apoJ, cholesterol homeostasis, and APP/Aβ processing and clearance at the BBB.

Abstract: The TMEM16A-mediated Ca2+-activated Cl− current drives several important physiological functions. Membrane lipids regulate ion channels and transporters but their influence on members of the TMEM16 family is poorly understood. Here we have studied the regulation of TMEM16A by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), cholesterol, and fatty acids using patch clamp, biochemistry and fluorescence microscopy. We found that depletion of membrane PI(4,5)P2 causes a decline in TMEM16A current that is independent of cytoskeleton, but is partially prevented by removing intracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, supplying PI(4,5)P2 to inside-out patches attenuated channel rundown and/or partially rescued activity after channel rundown. Also, depletion (with methyl-β-cyclodextrin M-βCD) or restoration (with M-βCD+cholesterol) of membrane cholesterol slows down the current decay observed after reduction of PI(4,5)P2. Neither depletion nor restoration of cholesterol change PI(4,5)P2 content. However, M-βCD alone transiently increases TMEM16A activity and dampens rundown whereas M-βCD+cholesterol increases channel rundown. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 is required for TMEM16A function while cholesterol directly and indirectly via a PI(4,5)P2-independent mechanism regulate channel function. Stearic, arachidonic, oleic, docosahexaenoic, and eicosapentaenoic fatty acids as well as methyl stearate inhibit TMEM16A in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner. Phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid whose hydrocarbon tails contain stearic and oleic acids also inhibits TMEM16A. Finally, we show that TMEM16A remains in the plasma membrane after treatment with M-βCD, M-βCD+cholesterol, oleic, or docosahexaenoic acids. Thus, we propose that lipids and fatty acids regulate TMEM16A channels through a membrane-delimited protein-lipid interaction.

Abstract: Alterations in lipid metabolism play a significant role in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders, and dysregulation of the lipidome across multiple diseases has prompted research to identify novel lipids indicative of disease progression. To address the significant gap in knowledge regarding the effect of age and diet on the blood lipidome, we used shotgun lipidomics with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). We analyzed blood lipid profiles of female C57BL/6 mice following high-fat diet (HFD) and low-fat diet (LFD) consumption for short (6weeks), long (22weeks), and prolonged (36weeks) periods. We examined endocannabinoid levels, plasma esterase activity, liver homeostasis, and indices of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity to compare lipid alterations with metabolic dysregulation. Multivariate analysis indicated differences in dietary blood lipid profiles with the most notable differences after 6weeks along with robust alterations due to age. HFD altered phospholipids, fatty acyls, and glycerolipids. Endocannabinoid levels were affected in an age-dependent manner, while HFD increased plasma esterase activity at all time points, with the most pronounced effect at 6weeks. HFD-consumption also altered liver mRNA levels of PPARα, PPARγ, and CD36. These findings indicate an interaction between dietary fat consumption and aging with widespread effects on the lipidome, which may provide a basis for identification of female-specific obesity- and age-related lipid biomarkers.

Abstract: Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) catalyzes the formation of the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Psd1p is localized to mitochondria, anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) through membrane spanning domains and oriented towards the mitochondrial intermembrane space. We found that Psd1p harbors at least two inner membrane-associated domains, which we named IM1 and IM2. IM1 is important for proper orientation of Psd1p within the IMM (Horvath et al., J. Biol. Chem. 287 (2012) 36744–55), whereas it remained unclear whether IM2 is important for membrane-association of Psd1p. To discover the role of IM2 in Psd1p import, processing and assembly into the mitochondria, we constructed Psd1p variants with deletions in IM2. Removal of the complete IM2 led to an altered topology of the protein with the soluble domain exposed to the matrix and to decreased enzyme activity. Psd1p variants lacking portions of the N-terminal moiety of IM2 were inserted into IMM with an altered topology. Psd1p variants with deletions of C-terminal portions of IM2 accumulated at the outer mitochondrial membrane and lost their enzyme activity. In conclusion we showed that IM2 is essential for full enzymatic activity, maturation and correct integration of yeast Psd1p into the inner mitochondrial membrane.
