Abstract: Pancreatic islet cells develop mature physiological responses to glucose and other fuels postnatally. In this study, we used fluorescence imaging techniques to measure changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) to compare islets isolated from mice on postnatal days 0, 4, and 12 with islets from adult CD-1 mice. In addition, we used publicly available RNA-sequencing data to compare expression levels of key genes in β-cell physiology with [Ca2+]i data across these ages. We show that islets isolated from mice on postnatal day 0 displayed elevated [Ca2+]i in basal glucose (≤4 mM) but lower [Ca2+]i responses to stimulation by 12−20 mM glucose compared to adult. Neonatal islets displayed more adult-like [Ca2+]i in basal glucose by day 4 but continued to show lower [Ca2+]i responses to 16 and 20 mM glucose stimulation up to at least day 12. A right shift in glucose sensing (EC50) correlated with lower fragment-per-kilobase-of-transcript-per-million-reads-mapped (FPKM) of Slc2a2 (glut2) and Actn3 and increased FPKM for Galk1 and Nupr1. Differences in [Ca2+]i responses to additional stimuli were also observed. Calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum were elevated on day 0 but became adult-like by day 4, which corresponded with reduced expression in Atp2a2 (SERCA2) and novel K+-channel Ktd17, increased expression of Pml, Wfs1, Thada, and Herpud1, and basal [Ca2+]i maturing to adult levels. Ion-channel activity also matured rapidly, but RNA sequencing data mining did not yield strong leads. In conclusion, the maturation of islet [Ca2+]i signaling is complex and multifaceted; several possible gene targets were identified that may participate in this process.

Abstract: Summary
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDOs) degrade l-tryptophan to kynurenines and drive the de novo synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Unsurprisingly, various invertebrates, vertebrates, and even fungi produce IDO. In mammals, IDO1 also serves as a homeostatic regulator, modulating immune response to infection via local tryptophan deprivation, active catabolite production, and non-enzymatic cell signaling. Whether fungal Idos have pleiotropic functions that impact on host-fungal physiology is unclear. Here, we show that Aspergillus fumigatus possesses three ido genes that are expressed under conditions of hypoxia or tryptophan abundance. Loss of these genes results in increased fungal pathogenicity and inflammation in a mouse model of aspergillosis, driven by an alternative tryptophan degradation pathway to indole derivatives and the host aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Fungal tryptophan metabolic pathways thus cooperate with the host xenobiotic response to shape host-microbe interactions in local tissue microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines in the host defense against invading pathogens. Sustained production of IFNs, however, is detrimental to the host, as it provokes autoimmune diseases. Thus, the expression of IFNs is tightly controlled. We report that the mRNA 5′ cap-binding protein 4EHP plays a key role in regulating type I IFN concomitant with controlling virus replication, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4EHP suppresses IFN-β production by effecting the miR-34a-induced translational silencing of Ifnb1 mRNA. miR-34a is upregulated by both RNA virus infection and IFN-β induction, prompting a negative feedback regulatory mechanism that represses IFN-β expression via 4EHP. These findings demonstrate the direct involvement of 4EHP in virus-induced host response, underscoring a critical translational silencing mechanism mediated by 4EHP and miR-34a to impede sustained IFN production. This study highlights an intrinsic regulatory function for miRNA and the translation machinery in maintaining host homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
A thorough neuroanatomical study of the brain architecture is crucial for understanding its cellular compositions, connections, and working mechanisms. However, the fine- and multiscale features of neuron structures make it challenging for microscopic imaging, as it requires high contrast and high throughput simultaneously. Here, we propose chemical sectioning fluorescence tomography (CSFT) to solve this problem. By chemically switching OFF/ON the fluorescent state of the labeled proteins (FPs), we light only the top layer as thin as submicron for imaging without background interference. Combined with the wide-field fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) system, we have shown multicolor CSFT imaging. We also demonstrate mouse whole-brain imaging at the subcellular resolution, as well as the power for quantitative acquisition of synaptic-connection-related pyramidal dendritic spines and axon boutons on the brain-wide scale at the complete single-neuron level. We believe that the CSFT method would greatly facilitate our understanding of the brain-wide neuron networks.

Abstract: Summary
Bacillus subtilis structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes are topologically loaded at centromeric sites adjacent to the replication origin by the partitioning protein ParB. These ring-shaped ATPases then translocate down the left and right chromosome arms while tethering them together. Here, we show that the site-specific recombinase XerD, which resolves chromosome dimers, is required to unload SMC tethers when they reach the terminus. We identify XerD-specific binding sites in the terminus region and show that they dictate the site of unloading in a manner that depends on XerD but not its catalytic residue, its partner protein XerC, or the recombination site dif. Finally, we provide evidence that ParB and XerD homologs perform similar functions in Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, two broadly conserved factors that act at the origin and terminus have second functions in loading and unloading SMC complexes that travel between them.

Abstract: The adult neocortex is not hard-wired but instead retains the capacity to reorganise across multiple spatial scales long into adulthood. Plastic reorganisation occurs at the level of mesoscopic sensory maps, functional neuronal assemblies and synaptic ensembles and is thought to be a critical feature of neuronal network function. Here, we describe a series of approaches that use calcium imaging to measure network reorganisation across multiple spatial scales in vivo. At the mesoscopic level, we demonstrate that sensory activity can be measured in animals undergoing longitudinal behavioural assessment involving automated touchscreen tasks. At the cellular level, we show that network dynamics can be longitudinally measured at both stable and transient functional assemblies. At the level of single synapses, we show that functional subcellular calcium imaging approaches can be used to measure synaptic ensembles of dendritic spines in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that all three levels of imaging can be spatially related to local pathology in a preclinical rodent model of amyloidosis. We propose that multi-scale in vivo calcium imaging can be used to measure parallel plasticity processes operating across multiple spatial scales in both the healthy brain and preclinical models of disease.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostasis of intestinal epithelia is maintained by coordination of the proper rate of regeneration by stem cell division with the rate of cell loss. Regeneration of host epithelia is normally quiescent upon colonization of commensal bacteria; however, the epithelia often develop dysplasia in a context-dependent manner, the cause and underlying mechanism of which remain unclear. Here, we show that in Drosophila intestine, autophagy lowers the sensitivity of differentiated enterocytes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced in response to commensal bacteria. We find that autophagy deficiency provokes ROS-dependent excessive regeneration and subsequent epithelial dysplasia and barrier dysfunction. Mechanistically, autophagic substrate Ref(2)P/p62, which co-localizes and physically interacts with Dachs, a Hippo signaling regulator, accumulates upon autophagy deficiency and thus inactivates Hippo signaling, resulting in stem cell over-proliferation non-cell autonomously. Our findings uncover a mechanism whereby suppression of undesirable regeneration by autophagy maintains long-term homeostasis of intestinal epithelia.

Abstract: Summary
Inter-cellular heterogeneity in metabolic state has been proposed to influence many cancer phenotypes, including responses to targeted therapy. Here, we track the transitions and heritability of metabolic states in single PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells, identify non-genetic glycolytic heterogeneity, and build on observations derived from methods reliant on bulk analyses. Using fluorescent biosensors in vitro and in tumors, we have identified distinct subpopulations of cells whose glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism are regulated by combinations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, bromodomain activity, and cell crowding effects. The actin severing protein cofilin, as well as PI3K, regulates rapid changes in glucose metabolism, whereas treatment with the bromodomain inhibitor slowly abrogates a subpopulation of cells whose glycolytic activity is PI3K independent. We show how bromodomain function and PI3K signaling, along with actin remodeling, independently modulate glycolysis and how targeting these pathways affects distinct subpopulations of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of crystals is critical for the associated fibrosis and cancer. Of note, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the highly representative products of nanotechnology, induce macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cause asbestosis-like pathogenesis. However, it remains largely unknown how macrophages efficiently recognize MWCNTs on their cell surfaces. Here, we identify by a targeted screening of phagocyte receptors the phosphatidylserine receptors T cell immunoglobulin mucin 4 (Tim4) and Tim1 as the pattern-recognition receptors for carbon crystals. Docking simulation studies reveal spatiotemporally stable interfaces between aromatic residues in the extracellular IgV domain of Tim4 and one-dimensional carbon crystals. Further, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of Tim4 and Tim1 reveals that Tim4, but not Tim1, critically contributes to the recognition of MWCNTs by peritoneal macrophages and to granuloma development in a mouse model of direct mesothelium exposure to MWCNTs. These results suggest that Tim4 recognizes MWCNTs through aromatic interactions and mediates phagocytosis leading to granulomas.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells package their genomes around histone octamers. In response to DNA damage, checkpoint activation in yeast induces core histone degradation resulting in 20%–40% reduction in nucleosome occupancy. To gain insight into this process, we developed a new approach to analyze the chromatin-associated proteome comprehensively before and after damage. This revealed extensive changes in protein composition after Zeocin-induced damage. First, core histones and the H1 homolog Hho1 were partially lost from chromatin along with replication, transcription, and chromatin remodeling machineries, while ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome were recruited. We found that the checkpoint- and INO80C-dependent recruitment of five ubiquitin-conjugating factors (Rad6, Bre1, Pep5, Ufd4, and Rsp5) contributes to core and linker histone depletion, reducing chromatin compaction and enhancing DNA locus mobility. Importantly, loss of Rad6/Bre1, Ufd4/TRIP12, and Pep5/VPS11 compromise DNA strand invasion kinetics during homology-driven repair. Thus we provide a comprehensive overview of a functionally relevant genome-wide chromatin response to DNA damage.

Abstract: Background
Dental trauma, restorative operative procedures and/or caries lesions can expose the dental pulp. Facing this clinical condition, where the maintenance of the dentin-pulp complex vitality is imperative, is challenging in Dentistry. Dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium contains trophic factors that could help in this task. This in vivo pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of the human dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium on the dental pulp tissue response to vital pulp therapy.
Material and methods
Concentrated conditioned medium was obtained by incubating characterized human dental pulp stem cells with fresh culture medium. Pulp exposures performed at the first upper molars (n = 20) of Wistar rats were directly capped with: MTA or MTA + Conditioned Medium. Four and 8 weeks later, the samples were qualitatively analyzed in histological sections (H&E).
Results
When the conditioned medium was associated with MTA, there were a high percentage of samples presenting formation of dentin bridges and small percentage of pulp tissue with inflammatory signs in both experimental times. The conditioned medium improved the organization of the newly formed hard tissue.
Conclusions
The association of dental pulp stem cell conditioned medium with MTA showed beneficial effects on dentin-pulp complex regeneration and has promising potential for studies in regenerative dentistry.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria not only serve as a platform for innate immune signaling transduction but also enhance immune responses by releasing mitochondrial DNA and RNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether mitochondrial matrix proteins could be liberated and involved in immune responses remains enigmatic. Here, we identify the mitochondrial protein ERA G-protein-like 1 (ERAL1) as a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-interacting protein by using proximity-based labeling technology. ERAL1 deficiency markedly reduces the downstream antiviral signaling triggered by RNA viruses. Moreover, ERAL1-deficient mice are more susceptible to lethality following RNA virus infection than wild-type mice. After virus infection, ERAL1 is released from mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore. The cytosolic ERAL1 facilitates lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of retinoicacid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and promotes downstream MAVS polymerization, thus positively regulating antiviral responses.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence has revealed the mechanosensitive ion channel protein Piezo1 is contributing to tumorigenesis. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that Piezo1 was expressed in the HepG2 cell line and depletion of Piezo1 impaired proliferation and migration, as well as increased apoptosis in these cells. Using a Piezo1-specific activator, Yoda1, we identified that calcium entry induced by Yoda1 resulted in phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK, thereby activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. More strikingly, Piezo1 activation integrated with YAP signaling to control the nuclear translocation of YAP and regulation of its target genes. JNK, p38, and ERK (MAPK signaling) regulated Yoda1-induced YAP activation. Consistent with the association of calpain with Piezo1, we also found that calpain activity was decreased by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Piezo1. In addition, the growth of HCC tumors was inhibited in Piezo1 haploinsufficient mice. Together, our findings establish that the Piezo1/MAPK/YAP signaling cascade is essential for HepG2 cell function. These results highlight the importance of Piezo1 in HCC and the potential utility of Piezo1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies reveal great diversity in the structure, function, and efferent innervation of afferent synaptic connections between the cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which likely enables audition to process a wide range of sound pressures. By performing an extensive electron microscopic (EM) reconstruction of the neural circuitry in the mature mouse organ of Corti, we demonstrate that afferent SGN dendrites differ in abundance and composition of efferent innervation in a manner dependent on their afferent synaptic connectivity with IHCs. SGNs that sample glutamate release from several presynaptic ribbons receive more efferent innervation from lateral olivocochlear projections than those driven by a single ribbon. Next to the prevailing unbranched SGN dendrites, we found branched SGN dendrites that can contact several ribbons of 1–2 IHCs. Unexpectedly, medial olivocochlear neurons provide efferent innervation of SGN dendrites, preferring those forming single-ribbon, pillar-side synapses. We propose a fine-tuning of afferent and efferent SGN innervation.

Abstract: Oridonin has significant liver-protective effects, but its effect on liver steatosis has not been reported. We investigated the effects of oridonin on liver steatosis by cell cultures. The optimal experimental concentration of oridonin was determined through cytotoxicity experiments. A simple steatosis liver cell model was induced using free fatty acids (FFA). After adding oridonin to the FFA-induced cell model for 24 h, the lipid droplets and triglyceride (TG) content in the cells were measured by Oil Red O staining and TG kits. The expressions of autophagy-related markers (cyclin dependent kinases inhibitor 1a (p21), Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I and LC3-II, protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and phosphorylated-AMPK (p-AMPK)) were detected by Western blot. Based on the results, the cell model was further treated by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to determine the degree of steatosis and the expressions of autophagy-related factors. Oridonin at a concentration higher than 10 μmol/L caused cytotoxicity to the cells. Adding 10 μmol/L oridonin to the FFA-induced cell model effectively reduced lipid droplets and TG content in the cells. Oridonin up-regulated p21, Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions, but down-regulated those of p62 and LC3-I. Also, oridonin increased the ratios of LC3-II/LC3-I and p-AMPK/AMPK, but reduced that of p-AKT/AKT. With the addition of 3-MA, the effect of oridonin on reducing steatosis was partially reversed, and the autophagy was inhibited. This study found that oridonin can activate autophagy, thereby preventing simple steatosis of liver cells.

Abstract: Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels are voltage-independent and are activated by Ca2+ binding to the calmodulin constitutively associated with the channels. Both the pore-forming subunits and the associated calmodulin are subject to phosphorylation. Here, we investigated the modulation of different SK channel subtypes by phosphorylation, using the cultured endothelial cells as a tool. We report that casein kinase 2 (CK2) negatively modulates the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of SK1 and IK channel subtypes by more than 5-fold, whereas the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the SK3 and SK2 subtypes is only reduced by ∼2-fold, when heterologously expressed on the plasma membrane of cultured endothelial cells. The SK2 channel subtype exhibits limited cell surface expression in these cells, partly as a result of the phosphorylation of its C-terminus by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). SK2 channels expressed on the ER and mitochondria membranes may protect against cell death. This work reveals the subtype-specific modulation of the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity and subcellular localization of SK channels by phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells.

Its design captures the inter-relatedness between DNA variations and RNA expression, supporting in-depth exploration of both individual cancer genomes and full cohorts. Regulatory non-coding variants can be inspected and analyzed along with coding variants, and their functional impact further explored by examining 3D genome data from cancer cell lines. Further, GenomePaint correlates mutation and expression patterns with patient outcomes, and supports custom data upload. We used GenomePaint to unveil aberrant splicing that disrupts the RING domain of CREBBP, discover cis activation of the MYC oncogene by duplication of the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and explore the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity at EGFR in adult glioblastomas. These examples demonstrate that deep multi-omics exploration of individual cancer genomes enabled by GenomePaint can lead to biological insights for follow-up validation.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate measures of contrast sensitivity are important for evaluating visual disease progression and for navigation safety. Previous measures suggested that cortical contrast sensitivity was constant across widely different luminance ranges experienced indoors and outdoors. Against this notion, here, we show that luminance range changes contrast sensitivity in both cat and human cortex, and the changes are different for dark and light stimuli. As luminance range increases, contrast sensitivity increases more within cortical pathways signaling lights than those signaling darks. Conversely, when the luminance range is constant, light-dark differences in contrast sensitivity remain relatively constant even if background luminance changes. We show that a Naka-Rushton function modified to include luminance range and light-dark polarity accurately replicates both the statistics of light-dark features in natural scenes and the cortical responses to multiple combinations of contrast and luminance. We conclude that differences in light-dark contrast increase with luminance range and are largest in bright environments.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cellular origins of cardiac adipocytes (CAs) can offer important implications for the treatment of fat-associated cardiovascular diseases. Here, we perform lineage tracing studies by using various genetic models and find that cardiac mesenchymal cells (MCs) contribute to CAs in postnatal development and adult homeostasis. Although PDGFRa+ and PDGFRb+ MCs both give rise to intramyocardial adipocytes, PDGFRb+ MCs are demonstrated to be the major source of intramyocardial adipocytes. Moreover, we find that PDGFRb+ cells are heterogenous, as PDGFRb is expressed not only in pericytes and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) but also in some subendocardial, pericapillary, or adventitial PDGFRa+ fibroblasts. Dual-recombinase-mediated intersectional genetic lineage tracing reveals that PDGFRa+PDGFRb+ double-positive periendothelial fibroblasts contribute to intramyocardial adipocytes. In contrast, SMCs and NG2+ pericytes do not contribute to CAs. These in vivo findings demonstrate that PDGFRb+ MCs, but not NG2+ coronary vascular mural cells, are the major source of intramyocardial adipocytes.

Abstract: There are no approved symptomatic treatments for vascular dementia (VaD). Rapamycin (RAPA) improves cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease rats. To explore whether RAPA improves cognitive impairment after VaD and its possible molecular mechanisms. Thirty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham (received sham-operation), VaD model (received permanent ligation of bilateral carotid arteries) and RAPA (7.5 mg/kg) treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. Mitophagy was assessed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ATP level, transmission electron microscope and mitophagy-associated proteins. Proteins were quantified by Western blot and immunofluorescence. BV2 cells were exposed to RAPA or/and MHY1485 (mTOR activator) to verify in vivo results. Compared to VaD rats, the escape latency of RAPA-treated rats was significantly decreased, and time spent in target quadrant was longer. Pathologic changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of neuronal apoptosis and related proteins in VaD rats were remarkably alleviated by RAPA. After RAPA treatment, an increase in number of autophagosomes was observed, along with up-regulation of mitophagy-related proteins. Overexpression of PI3K, AKT and mTOR were suppressed by RAPA treatment. In vitro experiments confirmed effects of RAPA, and demonstrated that MHY1485 addition reversed the RAPA-caused apoptosis inhibition and mitophagy enhancement. Overall, RAPA improved the cognitive impairment of VaD rats, alleviated neuronal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. We proposed a potential mechanism that RAPA may play improving role by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and enhancing mitophagy through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Findings provided an exciting possibility for novel treatment strategy of VaD.

Abstract: Summary
Arabidopsis GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 (GSK3)-like kinases play various roles in plant development, including chloroplast development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that transcription factors GLK1 and GLK2 interact with and are phosphorylated by the BRASSINOSTEROID insensitive2 (BIN2). The loss-of-function mutant of BIN2 and its homologs, bin2-3 bil1 bil2, displays abnormal chloroplast development, whereas the gain-of-function mutant, bin2-1, exhibits insensitivity to BR-induced de-greening and reduced numbers of thylakoids per granum, suggesting that BIN2 positively regulates chloroplast development. Furthermore, BIN2 phosphorylates GLK1 at T175, T238, T248, and T256, and mutations of these phosphorylation sites alter GLK1 protein stability and DNA binding and impair plant responses to BRs/darkness. On the other hand, BRs and darkness repress the BIN2-GLK module to enhance BR/dark-mediated de-greening and impair the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Our results thus provide a mechanism by which BRs modulate photomorphogenesis and chloroplast development.

Abstract: Summary
Many genes are regulated by multiple enhancers that often simultaneously activate their target gene. However, how individual enhancers collaborate to activate transcription is not well understood. Here, we dissect the functions and interdependencies of five enhancer elements that together activate Fgf5 expression during exit from naive murine pluripotency. Four intergenic elements form a super-enhancer, and most of the elements contribute to Fgf5 induction at distinct time points. A fifth, poised enhancer located in the first intron contributes to Fgf5 expression at every time point by amplifying overall Fgf5 expression levels. Despite low individual enhancer activity, together these elements strongly induce Fgf5 expression in a super-additive fashion that involves strong accumulation of RNA polymerase II at the intronic enhancer. Finally, we observe a strong anti-correlation between RNA polymerase II levels at enhancers and their distance to the closest promoter, and we identify candidate elements with properties similar to the intronic enhancer.

Abstract: Summary
In multicellular eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (Pol) II pauses transcription ~30–50 bp after initiation. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces has its transcription mechanisms mostly conserved with other eukaryotes, it appears to lack this fundamental promoter-proximal pausing. However, we now report that nearly all yeast genes, including constitutive and inducible genes, manifest two distinct transcriptional stall sites that are brought on by acute environmental signaling (e.g., peroxide stress). Pol II first stalls at the pre-initiation stage before promoter clearance, but after DNA melting and factor acquisition, and may involve inhibited dephosphorylation. The second stall occurs at the +2 nucleosome. It acquires most, but not all, elongation factor interactions. Its regulation may include Bur1/Spt4/5. Our results suggest that a double Pol II stall is a mechanism to downregulate essentially all genes in concert.

Abstract: Summary
Attenuating pathological angiogenesis in diseases characterized by neovascularization such as diabetic retinopathy has transformed standards of care. Yet little is known about the molecular signatures discriminating physiological blood vessels from their diseased counterparts, leading to off-target effects of therapy. We demonstrate that in contrast to healthy blood vessels, pathological vessels engage pathways of cellular senescence. Senescent (p16INK4A-expressing) cells accumulate in retinas of patients with diabetic retinopathy and during peak destructive neovascularization in a mouse model of retinopathy. Using either genetic approaches that clear p16INK4A-expressing cells or small molecule inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL, we show that senolysis suppresses pathological angiogenesis. Single-cell analysis revealed that subsets of endothelial cells with senescence signatures and expressing Col1a1 are no longer detected in BCL-xL-inhibitor-treated retinas, yielding a retina conducive to physiological vascular repair. These findings provide mechanistic evidence supporting the development of BCL-xL inhibitors as potential treatments for neovascular retinal disease.

Abstract: Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the most abundant mitochondrial outer membrane protein, is important for a variety of mitochondrial functions including metabolite exchange, calcium transport, and apoptosis. While VDAC’s role in shuttling metabolites between the cytosol and mitochondria is well established, there is a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms of its regulation of mitochondrial calcium transport. Here we review the current literature on VDAC’s role in calcium signaling, its biophysical properties, physiological function, and pathology focusing on its importance in cardiac diseases. We discuss the specific biophysical properties of the three VDAC isoforms in mammalian cells—VDAC 1, 2, and 3—in relationship to calcium transport and their distinct roles in cell physiology and disease. Highlighting the emerging evidence that cytosolic proteins interact with VDAC and regulate its calcium permeability, we advocate for continued investigation into the VDAC interactome at the contact sites between mitochondria and organelles and its role in mitochondrial calcium transport.

Abstract: A non-tuberculous mycobacterium, Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging opportunistic pathogen associated with difficult to treat pulmonary infections, particularly in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. It is capable of forming biofilms in vitro that result in an increase of already high levels of antibiotic resistance in this bacterium. Evidence that M. abscessus forms biofilm-like microcolonies in patient lungs and on medical devices further implicated the need to investigate this biofilm in detail. Therefore, in this study we characterized the M. abscessus pellicular biofilm, formed on a liquid–air interface, by studying its molecular composition, and its transcriptional profile in comparison to planktonic cells. Using scanning electron micrographs and fluorescence microscopy, we showed that M. abscessus biofilms produce an extracellular matrix composed of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and extracellular DNA. Transcriptomic analysis of biofilms revealed an upregulation of pathways involved in the glyoxylate shunt, redox metabolism and mycolic acid biosynthesis. Genes involved in elongation and desaturation of mycolic acids were highly upregulated in biofilms and, mirroring those findings, biochemical analysis of mycolates revealed molecular changes and an increase in mycolic acid chain length. Together these results give us an insight into the complex structure of M. abscessus biofilms, the understanding of which may be adapted for clinical use in treatment of biofilm infections, including strategies for dispersing the extracellular matrix, allowing antibiotics to gain access to bacteria within the biofilm.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes replicate via spatially and temporally regulated origin firing. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) promote origin firing, whereas the S phase checkpoint limits firing to prevent nucleotide and RPA exhaustion. We used chemical genetics to interrogate human DDK with maximum precision, dissect its relationship with the S phase checkpoint, and identify DDK substrates. We show that DDK inhibition (DDKi) leads to graded suppression of origin firing and fork arrest. S phase checkpoint inhibition rescued origin firing in DDKi cells and DDK-depleted Xenopus egg extracts. DDKi also impairs RPA loading, nascent-strand protection, and fork restart. Via quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identify the BRCA1-associated (BRCA1-A) complex subunit MERIT40 and the cohesin accessory subunit PDS5B as DDK effectors in fork protection and restart. Phosphorylation neutralizes autoinhibition mediated by intrinsically disordered regions in both substrates. Our results reveal mechanisms through which DDK controls the duplication of large vertebrate genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in metabolism plays an unknown role in physiology and pharmacology. To functionally characterize cellular variability in metabolism, we treated cells with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and monitored their responses with live-cell reporters for ATP, ADP/ATP, or activity of the energy-sensing kinase AMPK. Across multiple OXPHOS inhibitors and cell types, we identified a subpopulation of cells resistant to activation of AMPK and reduction of ADP/ATP ratio. This resistant state persists transiently for at least several hours and can be inherited during cell divisions. OXPHOS inhibition suppresses the mTORC1 and ERK growth signaling pathways in sensitive cells, but not in resistant cells. Resistance is linked to a multi-factorial combination of increased glucose uptake, reduced protein biosynthesis, and G0/G1 cell-cycle status. Our results reveal dynamic fluctuations in cellular energetic balance and provide a basis for measuring and predicting the distribution of cellular responses to OXPHOS inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal is a key characteristic of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) responsible for the development and maintenance of leukemia. In this study, we identify CD93 as an important regulator of self-renewal and proliferation of murine and human LSCs, but not hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The intracellular domain of CD93 promotes gene transcription via the transcriptional regulator SCY1-like pseudokinase 1 independently of ligation of the extracellular domain. In a drug library screen, we identify the anti-emetic agent metoclopramide as an efficient blocker of CD93 signaling. Metoclopramide treatment reduces murine and human LSCs in vitro and prolongs survival of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) mice through downregulation of pathways related to stemness and proliferation in LSCs. Overall, these results identify CD93 signaling as an LSC-specific regulator of self-renewal and proliferation and a targetable pathway to eliminate LSCs in CML.

Abstract: Background
Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (HILPDA) is considered to have tumorigenic activity, but its function in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is rarely known. This work aimed to assess the regulatory functions as well as the in-depth mechanism of HILPDA in LUAD.
Methods
The expression of HILPDA in LUAD tissues was analyzed based on TCGA database, and then qRT-PCR was performed to confirm the HILPDA expression in LUAD cell lines. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to measure the correlation of HILPDA expression and overall survival in patients with LUAD. Then, Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation and transwell assays were performed to detect cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Moreover, the pathways closely related to the high HILPDA expression was analyzed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The levels of Cell cycle pathway-related proteins were assessed using western blotting.
Results
Herein, we revealed that HILPDA was expressed at high levels in LUAD tissues and cell lines, and LUAD patients with the higher HILPDA expression presented the shorter survival time. Down-regulation of HILPDA in Calu-3 cells can retard cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as arrest cells in the G1 phase, whereas overexpression of HILPDA in A549 cells presented a marked promotion on these phenotypes. Moreover, we surveyed that knockdown of HILPDA restrained the activation of cell cycle pathway, while up-regulation of HILPDA led to opponent outcomes.
Conclusions
In summing, HILPDA may act as an oncogenic factor in LUAD cells via modulating cell cycle pathway, which represent a novel biomarker of tumorigenesis in LUAD patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognition of cytosolic DNA is critical for the immune response to cancer and pathogen infection. Here, we discover that cGAS-DNA phase separation is required to resist negative regulation and allow efficient sensing of immunostimulatory DNA. We map the molecular determinants of cGAS condensate formation and demonstrate that phase separation functions to limit activity of the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1. Mechanistically, phase separation forms a selective environment that suppresses TREX1 catalytic function and restricts DNA degradation to an outer shell at the droplet periphery. We identify a TREX1 mutation associated with the severe autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome that increases penetration of TREX1 into the repressive droplet interior and specifically impairs degradation of phase-separated DNA. Our results define a critical function of cGAS-DNA phase separation and reveal a molecular mechanism that balances cytosolic DNA degradation and innate immune activation.

Abstract: Summary
CD147 is a tumor-associated glycoprotein that regulates cell metabolism. However, CD147 methylation and its subsequent role in cancer cell metabolism remain unclear. Here, we detect CD147 di-methylation in 16 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CD147 is di-methylated to CD147-K234me2 by lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A). The increase in KMT5A expression boosts the levels of CD147-K234me2, further promoting the interaction between CD147 and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), which enhances the translocation of MCT4 from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Overexpression of CD147-K234me2 and KMT5A enhances glycolysis and lactate export in NSCLC cells. Clinical analysis shows that high CD147-K234me2 expression is significantly related to cancer progression and overall survival, and has prognostic significance in individuals with NSCLC, especially for those in the early stages. Our findings indicate that CD147-K234me2 plays a critical role in cancer metabolism, and it can be a highly promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian COP9 signalosome (CSN) exists as two variant complexes containing either CSN7A or CSN7B paralogs of unknown functional specialization. Constructing knockout cells, we found that CSN7A and CSN7B have overlapping functions in the deneddylation of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. Nevertheless, CSNCSN7B has a unique function in DNA double-strand break (DSB) sensing, being selectively required for ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent formation of NBS1S343p and γH2AX as well as DNA-damage-induced apoptosis triggered by mitomycin C and ionizing radiation. Live-cell microscopy revealed rapid recruitment of CSN7B but not CSN7A to DSBs. Resistance of CSN7B knockout cells to DNA damage is explained by the failure to deneddylate an upstream DSB signaling component, causing a switch in DNA repair pathway choice with increased utilization of non-homologous end joining over homologous recombination. In mice, CSN7B knockout tumors are resistant to DNA-damage-inducing chemotherapy, thus providing an explanation for the poor prognosis of tumors with low CSN7B expression.

Abstract: Anoctamin 6/TMEM16F (ANO6) is a dual-function protein with Ca2+-activated ion channel and Ca2+-activated phospholipid scramblase activities, requiring a high intracellular Ca2+ concentration (e.g., half-maximal effective Ca2+ concentration [EC50] of [Ca2+]i > 10 μM), and strong and sustained depolarization above 0 mV. Structural comparison with Anoctamin 1/TMEM16A (ANO1), a canonical Ca2+-activated chloride channel exhibiting higher Ca2+ sensitivity (EC50 of 1 μM) than ANO6, suggested that a homologous Ca2+-transferring site in the N-terminal domain (Nt) might be responsible for the differential Ca2+ sensitivity and kinetics of activation between ANO6 and ANO1. To elucidate the role of the putative Ca2+-transferring reservoir in the Nt (Nt-CaRes), we constructed an ANO6-1-6 chimera in which Nt-CaRes was replaced with the corresponding domain of ANO1. ANO6-1-6 showed higher sensitivity to Ca2+ than ANO6. However, neither the speed of activation nor the voltage-dependence differed between ANO6 and ANO6-1-6. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed a reduced Ca2+ interaction with Nt-CaRes in ANO6 than ANO6-1-6. Moreover, mutations on potentially Ca2+-interacting acidic amino acids in ANO6 Nt-CaRes resulted in reduced Ca2+ sensitivity, implying direct interactions of Ca2+ with these residues. Based on these results, we cautiously suggest that the net charge of Nt-CaRes is responsible for the difference in Ca2+ sensitivity between ANO1 and ANO6.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria and archaea apply CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes to defend against foreign invaders. These invading genetic elements are captured and integrated into the CRISPR array as spacer elements, guiding sequence-specific DNA/RNA targeting and cleavage. Recently, in vivo studies have shown that target RNAs with extended complementarity with repeat sequences flanking the target element (tag:anti-tag pairing) can dramatically reduce RNA cleavage by the type VI-A Cas13a system. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of Leptotrichia shahii LshCas13acrRNA in complex with target RNA harboring tag:anti-tag pairing complementarity, with the observed conformational changes providing a molecular explanation for inactivation of the composite HEPN domain cleavage activity. These structural insights, together with in vitro biochemical and in vivo cell-based assays on key mutants, define the molecular principles underlying Cas13a’s capacity to target and discriminate between self and non-self RNA targets. Our studies illuminate approaches to regulate Cas13a’s cleavage activity, thereby influencing Cas13a-mediated biotechnological applications.

Abstract: The aim of the study is to expand information on the histological aspect, presence, and distribution of cytoskeletal proteins: smooth muscle alpha-actin (α-SMA), desmin and vimentin in ovaries of three lizards Leiosauridae. In all analysed species, the ovaries were paired organs, located inside the coelomic cavity, covered in a simple cubic epithelium. Below the surface was the tunica albuginea. The organs can be divided into two regions: the cortex and the medulla. The pre-vitellogenic follicles consist of an oocyte surrounded by the pellucid zone periodic acid schiff positive, the granulosa layer consisting of three cell types: small, intermediate, and large and the theca layer. The vitellogenic follicles presented only a single layer of cubic granulosa cells. In the three lizards, α-SMA microfilaments (MFs) were verified along the theca layer and in endothelial cells of the blood vessels of the analysed follicles. Researchers have observed desmin intermediate filaments immunostaining exclusively muscle fibers of the albuginea and the ovarian stroma of Enyalius perditus. There was no immunostaining for vimentin in the ovaries of all the lizards studied. Results obtained revealed that the MFs of α-SMA could be responsible for a contractile activity present in the lizards assessed.

Abstract: Summary
Redox cofactor production is integral toward antioxidant generation, clearance of reactive oxygen species, and overall tumor response to ionizing radiation treatment. To identify systems-level alterations in redox metabolism that confer resistance to radiation therapy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for integrating multi-omics data into personalized genome-scale flux balance analysis models of 716 radiation-sensitive and 199 radiation-resistant tumors. These models collectively predicted that radiation-resistant tumors reroute metabolic flux to increase mitochondrial NADPH stores and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Simulated genome-wide knockout screens agreed with experimental siRNA gene knockdowns in matched radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant cancer cell lines, revealing gene targets involved in mitochondrial NADPH production, central carbon metabolism, and folate metabolism that allow for selective inhibition of glutathione production and H2O2 clearance in radiation-resistant cancers. This systems approach represents a significant advancement in developing quantitative genome-scale models of redox metabolism and identifying personalized metabolic targets for improving radiation sensitivity in individual cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial and fibroblast niches are crucial for epithelial organs. How these heterotypic cells interact is of great interest. In this study, we reveal an axis of signaling in which fibroblasts relay Wnt signals from the endothelial niche to organize epithelial patterning. We generate an Axin2-membrane GFP (mGFP) reporter mouse and observe robust Wnt/β-catenin signaling activities in fibroblasts surrounding the mammary epithelium. To enable cell-type-specific gene manipulation in vitro, we establish an organoid system via coculture of endothelial cells (ECs), fibroblasts, and mammary epithelial cells. Deletion of β-catenin in fibroblasts impedes epithelium branching, and ECs are responsible for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in fibroblasts. In vivo, EC deletion of Wntless inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in fibroblasts, rendering a reduction in epithelial branches. These findings highlight the significance of the endothelial niche in tissue patterning, shedding light on the interactive mechanisms in which distinct niche components orchestrate epithelial organogenesis and tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for maintenance of genome integrity. Rad51 paralogs fulfill a conserved but undefined role in HR, and their mutations are associated with increased cancer risk in humans. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to reveal that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 paralog complex Rad55-Rad57 promotes assembly of Rad51 recombinase filament through transient interactions, providing evidence that it acts like a classical molecular chaperone. Srs2 is an ATP-dependent anti-recombinase that downregulates HR by actively dismantling Rad51 filaments. Contrary to the current model, we find that Rad55-Rad57 does not physically block the movement of Srs2. Instead, Rad55-Rad57 promotes rapid re-assembly of Rad51 filaments after their disruption by Srs2. Our findings support a model in which Rad51 is in flux between free and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-bound states, the rate of which is controlled dynamically though the opposing actions of Rad55-Rad57 and Srs2.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors regulate gene networks controlling normal hematopoiesis and are frequently deregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Critical to our understanding of the mechanism of cellular transformation by oncogenic transcription factors is the ability to define their direct gene targets. However, gene network cascades can change within minutes to hours, making it difficult to distinguish direct from secondary or compensatory transcriptional changes by traditional methodologies. To overcome this limitation, we devised cell models in which the AML1-ETO protein could be quickly degraded upon addition of a small molecule. The rapid kinetics of AML1-ETO removal, when combined with analysis of transcriptional output by nascent transcript analysis and genome-wide AML1-ETO binding by CUT&RUN, enabled the identification of direct gene targets that constitute a core AML1-ETO regulatory network. Moreover, derepression of this gene network was associated with RUNX1 DNA binding and triggered a transcription cascade ultimately resulting in myeloid differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Transformation of sensory inputs to goal-directed actions requires estimation of sensory-cue values based on outcome history. We conduct wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging of the mouse neocortex during classical conditioning with two cues with different water-reward probabilities. Although licking movement dominates the area-averaged activity over the whole dorsal neocortex, the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFrC) affects other dorsal frontal cortical activities, and its inhibition extinguishes differences in anticipatory licking between the cues. Many dorsal frontal and medial prefrontal cortical neurons are task related. Subsets of these neurons are more excited by the low-reward-predicting cue or unrewarded outcomes than by the high-reward-predicting cue or rewarded outcomes, respectively. Task-related activities of these neurons and the others are counterbalanced, so that population activity appears dominated by licking. The reward-predicting cue and outcome history are most strongly represented in dmFrC. Our results suggest that dmFrC is crucial for initiating cortical processes to select or inhibit action.

Abstract: The temporal dynamics of calcium signaling are critical regulators of chondrocyte homeostasis and chondrogenesis. Calcium oscillations regulate differentiation and anabolic processes in chondrocytes and their precursors. Attempts to control chondrocyte calcium signaling have been achieved through mechanical perturbations and synthetic ion channel modulators. However, such stimuli can lack both local and global specificity and precision when evoking calcium signals. Synthetic signaling platforms can more precisely and selectively activate calcium signaling, enabling improved dissection of the roles of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in chondrocyte behavior. One such platform is hM3Dq, a chemogenetic DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) that activates calcium signaling via the Gαq-PLCβ-IP3-ER pathway upon administration of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). We previously described the first-use of hM3Dq to precisely mediate targeted, synthetic calcium signals in chondrocyte-like ATDC5 cells. Here, we generated stably expressing hM3Dq-ATDC5 cells to investigate the dynamics of Gαq-GPCR calcium signaling in depth. CNO drove robust calcium responses in a temperature- and concentration-dependent (1 pM–100 μM) manner and elicited elevated levels of oscillatory calcium signaling above 10 nM. hM3Dq-mediated calcium oscillations in ATDC5 cells were reliant on ER calcium stores for both initiation and sustenance, and the downregulation and recovery dynamics of hM3Dq after CNO stimulation align with traditionally reported GPCR recycling kinetics. This study successfully generated a stable hM3Dq cell line to precisely drive Gαq-GPCR-mediated and ER-dependent oscillatory calcium signaling in ATDC5 cells and established a novel tool to elucidate the role that GPCR-mediated calcium signaling plays in chondrocyte biology, cartilage pathology, and cartilage tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
TCF1 plays a critical role in T lineage commitment and the development of αβ lineage T cells, but its role in γδ T cell development remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a regulatory axis where T cell receptor (TCR) signaling controls TCF1 expression through an E-protein-bound regulatory element in the Tcf7 locus, and this axis regulates both γδ T lineage commitment and effector fate. Indeed, the level of TCF1 expression plays an important role in setting the threshold for γδ T lineage commitment and modulates the ability of TCR signaling to influence effector fate adoption by γδ T lineage progenitors. This finding provides mechanistic insight into how TCR-mediated repression of E proteins promotes the development of γδ T cells and their adoption of the interleukin (IL)-17-producing effector fate. IL-17-producing γδ T cells have been implicated in cancer progression and in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal and glycemic traits have shared etiology, but the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown. To identify genetic loci that may have pleiotropic effects, we studied Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for bone mineral density and glycemic traits and identified a bivariate risk locus at 3q21. Using sequence and epigenetic modeling, we prioritized an adenylate cyclase 5 (ADCY5) intronic causal variant, rs56371916. This SNP changes the binding affinity of SREBP1 and leads to differential ADCY5 gene expression, altering the chromatin landscape from poised to repressed. These alterations result in bone- and type 2 diabetes-relevant cell-autonomous changes in lipid metabolism in osteoblasts and adipocytes. We validated our findings by directly manipulating the regulator SREBP1, the target gene ADCY5, and the variant rs56371916, which together imply a novel link between fatty acid oxidation and osteoblast differentiation. Our work, by systematic functional dissection of pleiotropic GWAS loci, represents a framework to uncover biological mechanisms affecting pleiotropic traits.

Abstract: Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers. The present study devotes efforts to discover the role of miR-128-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
MiR-128-3p and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6) expressions in HCC tissue (n = 50) and adjacent normal tissue (n = 50) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MTT assay and flow cytometry were applied to measure the viability and cell cycle distribution of HuH7 and HCCLM3 cells, respectively. The potential binding sites of miR-128-3p on CDC6 were predicted with Targetscan 7.2 and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Expression analysis of CDC6 and survival analysis in HCC were performed by GEPIA2. Wound healing and Transwell assays were used to detect HCC cell migration and invasion, respectively. Expressions of miR-128-3p and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (MMP2, MMP9, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and Vimentin) were quantified using qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively.
Results
MiR-128-3p mRNA expression was lower in HCC tissue than in adjacent normal tissues. HCC cell viability was suppressed and cell cycle was arrested in G0/S phase by miR-128-3p mimic. CDC6 was targeted by miR-128-3p and had higher expression in HCC tissue. The promotive effects of overexpressed CDC6 on HCC cell viability, migration and invasion were reversed by up-regulating miR-128-3p. And the effects of overexpressed CDC6 on inhibiting E-Cadherin expression yet promoting MMP2, MMP9, N-Cadherin and Vimentin expressions in HCC cells were reversed by up-regulating miR-128-3p.
Conclusion
MiR-128-3p may suppress HCC cell proliferation and metastasis via targeting CDC6.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell lineage tracing provides crucial insights into the fates of individual cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly applied in modern biomedical research, but genetics-based lineage tracing for scRNA-seq data is still unexplored. Variant calling from scRNA-seq data uniquely suffers from “expressional drop-outs,” including low expression and allelic bias in gene expression, which presents significant obstacles for lineage reconstruction. We introduce SClineager, which infers accurate evolutionary lineages from scRNA-seq data by borrowing information from related cells to overcome expressional drop-outs. We systematically validate SClineager and show that genetics-based lineage tracing is applicable for single-cell-sequencing studies of both tumor and non-tumor tissues using SClineager. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool that can be applied to scRNA-seq data to decipher the lineage histories of cells and that could address a missing opportunity to reveal valuable information from the large amounts of existing scRNA-seq data.

Abstract: Summary
The intestine is under constant exposure to chemicals, antigens, and microorganisms from the external environment. Apical aspects of transporting epithelial cells (enterocytes) form a brush-border membrane (BBM), shaped by packed microvilli coated with a dense glycocalyx. We present evidence showing that the glycocalyx forms an epithelial barrier that prevents exogenous molecules and live bacteria from gaining access to BBM. We use a multi-omics approach to investigate the function and regulation of membrane mucins exposed on the BBM during postnatal development of the mouse small intestine. Muc17 is identified as a major membrane mucin in the glycocalyx that is specifically upregulated by IL-22 as part of an epithelial defense repertoire during weaning. High levels of IL-22 at time of weaning reprogram neonatal postmitotic progenitor enterocytes to differentiate into Muc17-expressing enterocytes, as found in the adult intestine during homeostasis. Our findings propose a role for Muc17 in epithelial barrier function in the small intestine.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment-persistent residual tumors impede curative cancer therapy. To understand this cancer cell state we generated models of treatment persistence that simulate the residual tumors. We observe that treatment-persistent tumor cells in organoids, xenografts, and cancer patients adopt a distinct and reversible transcriptional program resembling that of embryonic diapause, a dormant stage of suspended development triggered by stress and associated with suppressed Myc activity and overall biosynthesis. In cancer cells, depleting Myc or inhibiting Brd4, a Myc transcriptional co-activator, attenuates drug cytotoxicity through a dormant diapause-like adaptation with reduced apoptotic priming. Conversely, inducible Myc upregulation enhances acute chemotherapeutic activity. Maintaining residual cells in dormancy after chemotherapy by inhibiting Myc activity or interfering with the diapause-like adaptation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 9 represent potential therapeutic strategies against chemotherapy-persistent tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that cancer co-opts a mechanism similar to diapause with adaptive inactivation of Myc to persist during treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Feedback control has enabled the success of automated technologies by mitigating the effects of variability, unknown disturbances, and noise. While it is known that biological feedback loops reduce the impact of noise and help shape kinetic responses, many questions remain about how to design molecular integral controllers. Here, we propose a modular strategy to build molecular quasi-integral feedback controllers, which involves following two design principles. The first principle is to utilize an ultrasensitive response, which determines the gain of the controller and influences the steady-state error. The second is to use a tunable threshold of the ultrasensitive response, which determines the equilibrium point of the system. We describe a reaction network, named brink controller, that satisfies these conditions by combining molecular sequestration and an activation/deactivation cycle. With computational models, we examine potential biological implementations of brink controllers, and we illustrate different example applications.

CHIP and BAP1 Act in Concert to Regulate INO80 Ubiquitination and Stability for DNA Replication,

Abstract: The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex has roles in many essential cellular processes, including DNA replication. However, the mechanisms that regulate INO80 in these processes remain largely unknown. We previously reported that the stability of Ino80, the catalytic ATPase subunit of INO80, is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system and that BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear deubiquitinase with tumor suppressor activity, stabilizes Ino80 via deubiquitination and promotes replication fork progression. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Ino80 for proteasomal degradation was unknown. Here, we identified the C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), the E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions in cooperation with Hsp70, as an Ino80-interacting protein. CHIP polyubiquitinates Ino80 in a manner dependent on Hsp70. Contrary to our expectation that CHIP degrades Ino80, CHIP instead stabilizes Ino80 by extending its half-life. The data suggest that CHIP stabilizes Ino80 by inhibiting degradative ubiquitination. We also show that CHIP works together with BAP1 to enhance the stabilization of Ino80, leading to its chromatin binding. Interestingly, both depletion and overexpression of CHIP compromise replication fork progression with little effect on fork stalling, as similarly observed for BAP1 and Ino80, indicating that an optimal cellular level of Ino80 is important for replication fork speed but not for replication stress suppression. This work therefore idenitifes CHIP as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that stabilizes Ino80 via nondegradative ubiquitination and suggests that CHIP and BAP1 act in concert to regulate Ino80 ubiquitination to fine-tune its stability for efficient DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2 patients readily resolve infection while others develop severe disease. By interrogating metabolic programs of immune cells in severe and recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients compared with other viral infections, we identify a unique population of T cells. These T cells express increased Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 (VDAC1), accompanied by gene programs and functional characteristics linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The percentage of these cells increases in elderly patients and correlates with lymphopenia. Importantly, T cell apoptosis is inhibited in vitro by targeting the oligomerization of VDAC1 or blocking caspase activity. We also observe an expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells with unique metabolic phenotypes specific to COVID-19, and their presence distinguishes severe from mild disease. Overall, the identification of these metabolic phenotypes provides insight into the dysfunctional immune response in acutely ill COVID-19 patients and provides a means to predict and track disease severity and/or design metabolic therapeutic regimens.

Abstract: Summary
GABAergic interneurons migrate long distances through stereotyped migration programs toward specific laminar positions. During their migration, GABAergic interneurons are morphologically alike but then differentiate into a rich array of interneuron subtypes critical for brain function. How interneuron subtypes acquire their final phenotypic traits remains largely unknown. Here, we show that cerebellar molecular layer GABAergic interneurons, derived from the same progenitor pool, use separate migration paths to reach their laminar position and differentiate into distinct basket cell (BC) and stellate cell (SC) GABAergic interneuron subtypes. Using two-photon live imaging, we find that SC final laminar position requires an extra step of tangential migration supported by a subpopulation of glutamatergic granule cells (GCs). Conditional depletion of GCs affects SC differentiation but does not affect BCs. Our results reveal how timely feedforward control of inhibitory interneuron migration path regulates their terminal differentiation and, thus, establishment of the local inhibitory circuit assembly.

Abstract: Uniquely expressed in the colon, MS4A12 exhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) activity. However, compared to MS4A1 (CD20), a Ca2+ channel and ideal target for successful leukaemia immunotherapy, MS4A12 has rarely been studied. In this study, we investigated the involvement of MS4A12 in Ca2+ influx and expression changes in MS4A12 in human colonic malignancy. Fluorescence of GCaMP-fused MS4A12 (GCaMP-M12) was evaluated to analyse MS4A12 activity in Ca2+ influx. Plasma membrane expression of GCaMP-M12 was achieved by homo- or hetero-complex formation with no-tagged MS4A12 (nt-M12) or Orai1, respectively. GCaMP-M12 fluorescence in plasma membrane increased only after thapsigargin-induced depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, and this fluorescence was inhibited by typical SOCE inhibitors and siRNA for Orai1. Furthermore, GCaMP-MS4A12 and Orai1 co-transfection elicited greater plasma membrane fluorescence than GCaMP-M12 co-transfected with nt-M12. Interestingly, the fluorescence of GCaMP-M12 was decreased by STIM1 over-expression, while increased by siRNA for STIM1 in the presence of thapsigargin and extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Orai1 co-expression decreased protein interactions between MS4A12 and STIM1. In human colon tissue, MS4A12 was expressed in the apical region of the colonic epithelium, although its expression was dramatically decreased in colon cancer tissues. In conclusion, we propose that MS4A12 contributes to SOCE through complex formation with Orai1, but does not cooperate with STIM1. Additionally, we discovered that MS4A12 is expressed in the apical membrane of the colonic epithelium and that its expression is decreased with cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex supports the synthesis of damage-induced long non-coding RNA (dilncRNA) by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that recombinant human MRN and native RNAPII are sufficient to reconstitute a minimal functional transcriptional apparatus at DSBs. MRN recruits and stabilizes RNAPII at DSBs. Unexpectedly, transcription is promoted independently from MRN nuclease activities. Rather, transcription depends on the ability of MRN to melt DNA ends, as shown by the use of MRN mutants and specific allosteric inhibitors. Single-molecule FRET assays with wild-type and mutant MRN show a tight correlation between the ability to melt DNA ends and to promote transcription. The addition of RPA enhances MRN-mediated transcription, and unpaired DNA ends allow MRN-independent transcription by RNAPII. These results support a model in which MRN generates single-strand DNA ends that favor the initiation of transcription by RNAPII.

Abstract: Summary
Severe and often fatal opportunistic fungal infections arise frequently following mucosal damage caused by trauma or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Interaction of fungal pathogens with epithelial cells that comprise mucosae is a key early event associated with invasion, and, therefore, enhancing epithelial defense mechanisms may mitigate infection. Here, we establish a model of mold and yeast infection mediated by inducible epithelial cell loss in larval zebrafish. Epithelial cell loss by extrusion promotes exposure of laminin associated with increased fungal attachment, invasion, and larval lethality, whereas fungi defective in adherence or filamentation have reduced virulence. Transcriptional profiling identifies significant upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epigen (EPGN) upon mucosal damage. Treatment with recombinant human EPGN suppresses epithelial cell extrusion, leading to reduced fungal invasion and significantly enhanced survival. These data support the concept of augmenting epithelial restorative capacity to attenuate pathogenic invasion of fungi associated with human disease.

Abstract: Progressive neuronal loss is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. These pathologies exhibit clear signs of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium deregulation, and accumulation of aggregated or misfolded proteins. Over the last decades, a tremendous research effort has contributed to define some of the pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes in these complex brain neurodegenerative disorders. To better understand molecular mechanisms responsible for neurodegenerative processes and find potential interventions and pharmacological treatments, it is important to have robust in vitro and pre-clinical animal models that can recapitulate both the early biological events undermining the maintenance of the nervous system and early pathological events. In this regard, it would be informative to determine how different inherited pathogenic mutations can compromise mitochondrial function, calcium signaling, and neuronal survival. Since post-mortem analyses cannot provide relevant information about the disease progression, it is crucial to develop model systems that enable the investigation of early molecular changes, which may be relevant as targets for novel therapeutic options. Thus, the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represents an exceptional complementary tool for the investigation of degenerative processes. In this review, we will focus on two neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We will provide examples of iPSC-derived neuronal models and how they have been used to study calcium and mitochondrial alterations during neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Metallothionein (MT1M) belongs to a family of cysteine-rich cytosolic protein and has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers. However, its role in esophageal carcinoma carcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, MT1M expression was correlated with tumor type, stage, drinking and smoking history, as well as patient survival. We also studied the regulation and biological function of MT1M in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We have found that MT1M is significantly downregulated in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Furthermore, restoration of expression by treatment with the demethylation agent A + T showed that MT1M downregulation might be closely related to hypermethylation in its promoter region. Over-expression of MT1M in ESCC cells significantly altered cell morphology, induced apoptosis, and reduced colony formation, cell viability, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, a superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) activity assay and protein analysis, we verified that the tumor-suppressive function of MT1M was at least partially caused by its upregulation of ROS levels, downregulation of SOD1 activity and phosphorylation of the SOD1 downstream pathway PI3K/AKT. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that MT1M was a novel tumor-suppressor in ESCC and may be disrupted by promoter CpG methylation during esophageal carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the gene encoding the chromatin remodeler chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) are a highly penetrant risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although cerebellar abnormalities have long been thought to be related to ASD pathogenesis, it has remained largely unknown whether dysfunction of CHD8 in the cerebellum contributes to ASD phenotypes. We here show that cerebellar granule neuron progenitor (GNP)-specific deletion of Chd8 in mice impairs the proliferation and differentiation of these cells as well as gives rise to cerebellar hypoplasia and a motor coordination defect, but not to ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. CHD8 is found to regulate the expression of neuronal genes in GNPs. It also binds preferentially to promoter regions and modulates local chromatin accessibility of transcriptionally active genes in these cells. Our results have thus uncovered a key role for CHD8 in cerebellar development, with important implications for understanding the contribution of this brain region to ASD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a genetically modified herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV-1) approved for cancer therapy. We investigate its effect on the clinical, histological, single-cell transcriptomic, and immune repertoire level using repeated fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of injected and noninjected lesions in primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (pCBCL). Thirteen patients received intralesional T-VEC, 11 of which demonstrate tumor response in the injected lesions. Using single-cell sequencing of the FNAs, we identify the malignant population and separate three pCBCL subtypes. Twenty-four hours after the injection, we detect HSV-1T-VEC transcripts in malignant and nonmalignant cells of the injected lesion but not of the noninjected lesion. Oncolytic virotherapy results in a rapid eradication of malignant cells. It also leads to interferon pathway activation and early influx of natural killer cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These events are followed by enrichment in cytotoxic T cells and a decrease of regulatory T cells in injected and noninjected lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Gene transcription occurs via a cycle of linked events, including initiation, promoter-proximal pausing, and elongation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). A key question is how transcriptional enhancers influence these events to control gene expression. Here, we present an approach that evaluates the level and change in promoter-proximal transcription (initiation and pausing) in the context of differential gene expression, genome-wide. This combinatorial approach shows that in primary cells, control of gene expression during differentiation is achieved predominantly via changes in transcription initiation rather than via release of Pol II pausing. Using genetically engineered mouse models, deleted for functionally validated enhancers of the α- and β-globin loci, we confirm that these elements regulate Pol II recruitment and/or initiation to modulate gene expression. Together, our data show that gene expression during differentiation is regulated predominantly at the level of initiation and that enhancers are key effectors of this process.

Abstract: The plant primary cell wall is comprised of pectin, cellulose and hemicelluloses, whose dynamic interactions play essential roles in plant cell elongation. Through a chemical genetics screening, we identified a small molecule, named cell wall modulator (CWM), which disrupted cell growth and deformed cell shape in etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyl. A pectin defective mutant qua2, identified from screening an Arabidopsis EMS mutant library, showed a reduced sensitivity to CWM treatment. On the other hand, pectinase treatment suppressed the CWM induced phenotype. Furthermore, cellulose content was decreased in response to CWM treatment, while the cellulose synthesis mutants ixr1 and ixr2 were hypersensitive to CWM. Together, the study identified a small molecule CWM that induced a modification of the cell wall in elongating cells, likely through interfering with pectin modification. This molecule may be used as a tool to study cell wall remodeling during plant growth.

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissues display a remarkable ability to adapt to the dietary status. Here, we have applied single-nucleus RNA-seq to map the plasticity of mouse epididymal white adipose tissue at single-nucleus resolution in response to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. The single-nucleus approach allowed us to recover all major cell types and to reveal distinct transcriptional stages along the entire adipogenic trajectory from preadipocyte commitment to mature adipocytes. We demonstrate the existence of different adipocyte subpopulations and show that obesity leads to disappearance of the lipogenic subpopulation and increased abundance of the stressed lipid-scavenging subpopulation. Moreover, obesity is associated with major changes in the abundance and gene expression of other cell populations, including a dramatic increase in lipid-handling genes in macrophages at the expense of macrophage-specific genes. The data provide a powerful resource for future hypothesis-driven investigations of the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
SOX17 has been implicated in arterial specification and the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the murine embryo. However, knowledge about molecular pathways and stage-specific effects of SOX17 in humans remains limited. Here, using SOX17-knockout and SOX17-inducible human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), paired with molecular profiling studies, we reveal that SOX17 is a master regulator of HOXA and arterial programs in hemogenic endothelium (HE) and is required for the specification of HE with robust lympho-myeloid potential and DLL4+CXCR4+ phenotype resembling arterial HE at the sites of HSC emergence. Along with the activation of NOTCH signaling, SOX17 directly activates CDX2 expression, leading to the upregulation of the HOXA cluster genes. Since deficiencies in HOXA and NOTCH signaling contribute to the impaired in vivo engraftment of hPSC-derived hematopoietic cells, the identification of SOX17 as a key regulator linking arterial and HOXA programs in HE may help to program HSC fate from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive childhood tumor of the brainstem with currently no curative treatment available. The vast majority of DIPGs carry a histone H3 mutation leading to a lysine 27-to-methionine exchange (H3K27M). We engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to carry an inducible H3.3-K27M allele in the endogenous locus and studied the effects of the mutation in different disease-relevant neural cell types. H3.3-K27M upregulated bivalent promoter-associated developmental genes, producing diverse outcomes in different cell types. While being fatal for iPSCs, H3.3-K27M increased proliferation in neural stem cells (NSCs) and to a lesser extent in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Only NSCs gave rise to tumors upon induction of H3.3-K27M and TP53 inactivation in an orthotopic xenograft model recapitulating human DIPGs. In NSCs, H3.3-K27M leads to maintained expression of stemness and proliferative genes and a premature activation of OPC programs that together may cause tumor initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are effective anti-inflammatory drugs; yet, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. GCs bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-gated transcription factor controlling gene expression in numerous cell types. Here, we characterize GR’s protein interactome and find the SETD1A (SET domain containing 1A)/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex highly enriched in activated mouse macrophages. We show that SETD1A/COMPASS is recruited by GR to specific cis-regulatory elements, coinciding with H3K4 methylation dynamics at subsets of sites, upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and GCs. By chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq, we identify subsets of GR target loci that display SETD1A occupancy, H3K4 mono-, di-, or tri-methylation patterns, and transcriptional changes. However, our data on methylation status and COMPASS recruitment suggest that SETD1A has additional transcriptional functions. Setd1a loss-of-function studies reveal that SETD1A/COMPASS is required for GR-controlled transcription of subsets of macrophage target genes. We demonstrate that the SETD1A/COMPASS complex cooperates with GR to mediate anti-inflammatory effects.

Abstract: Summary
Brainstem networks that control regular tidal breathing depend on excitatory drive, including from tonically active, CO2/H+-sensitive neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Here, we examine intrinsic ionic mechanisms underlying the metronomic firing activity characteristic of RTN neurons. In mouse brainstem slices, large-amplitude membrane potential oscillations are evident in synaptically isolated RTN neurons after blocking action potentials. The voltage-dependent oscillations are abolished by sodium replacement; blocking calcium channels (primarily L-type); chelating intracellular Ca2+; and inhibiting TRPM4, a Ca2+-dependent cationic channel. Likewise, oscillation voltage waveform currents are sensitive to calcium and TRPM4 channel blockers. Extracellular acidification and serotonin (5-HT) evoke membrane depolarization that augments TRPM4-dependent oscillatory activity and action potential discharge. Finally, inhibition of TRPM4 channels in the RTN of anesthetized mice reduces central respiratory output. These data implicate TRPM4 in a subthreshold oscillation that supports the pacemaker-like firing of RTN neurons required for basal, CO2-stimulated, and state-dependent breathing.

Abstract: Actin re-organization and degradation of extracellular matrix by metalloproteases (MMPs) facilitate formation of cellular protrusions that are required for cell proliferation and migration. We find that Zn2+ activation of the Gq-coupled receptor ZnR/GPR39 controls these processes by regulating K+/Cl− co-transporter KCC3, which modulates cell volume. Silencing of KCC3 expression or activity reverses ZnR/GPR39 enhancement of cell proliferation, migration and invasion through Matrigel. Activation of ZnR/GPR39 recruits KCC3 into F-actin rich membrane protrusions, suggesting that it can locally control volume changes. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that Zn2+ activation of ZnR/GPR39 and KCC3 are required to enhance formation of F-actin stress fibers and cellular protrusions. In addition, ZnR/GPR39 upregulation of KCC3-dependent transport increases the activity of matrix metalloproteases MMP2 and MMP9. Our study establishes a mechanism in which ZnR/GPR39 orchestrates localization and activation of KCC3, formation of F-actin rich cell protrusions and activation of MMPs, and thereby controls cell proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Brain disease is known to cause irrevocable and fatal loss of biological function once damaged. One of various causes of its development is damage to neuron cells caused by hyperactivated microglia, which function as immune cells in brain. Among the genes expressed in microglia stimulated by various antigens, annexin A1 (ANXA1) is expressed in the early phase of the inflammatory response and plays an important role in controlling the immune response. In this study, we assessed whether ANXA1 can be a therapeutic target gene for the initial reduction of the immune response induced by microglia to minimize neuronal damage. To address this, mouse-origin microglial cells were stimulated to mimic an immune response by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The LPS treatment caused activation of ANXA1 gene and expression of inflammatory cytokines. To assess the biological function in microglia by the downregulation of ANXA1 gene, cells were treated with short hairpin RNA-ANXA1. Downregulated ANXA1 affected the function of mitochondria in the microglia and showed reduced neuronal damage when compared to the control group in the co-culture system. Taken together, our results showed that ANXA1 could be used as a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiota have been shown to promote oogenesis and fecundity, but the mechanistic basis of remote influence on oogenesis remained unknown. Here, we report a systemic mechanism of influence mediated by bacterial-derived supply of mitochondrial coenzymes. Removal of microbiota decreased mitochondrial activity and ATP levels in the whole-body and ovary, resulting in repressed oogenesis. Similar repression was caused by RNA-based knockdown of mitochondrial function in ovarian follicle cells. Reduced mitochondrial function in germ-free (GF) females was reversed by bacterial recolonization or supplementation of riboflavin, a precursor of FAD and FMN. Metabolomics analysis of GF females revealed a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and FAD levels and an increase in metabolites that are degraded by FAD-dependent enzymes (e.g., amino and fatty acids). Riboflavin supplementation opposed this effect, elevating mitochondrial function, ATP, and oogenesis. These findings uncover a bacterial-mitochondrial axis of influence, linking gut bacteria with systemic regulation of host energy and reproduction.

Abstract: Several studies have shown a relationship between the distribution of fat mass around the organism, metabolic disorders, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It has been demonstrated that in obese animals there is a big rise in the white fat deposits due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adipocytes. Studies related to weight and health have been more popular regarding obesity rather than extreme caquexia or calorico-proteic deficiencies, but these states are interesting from the point of view of the preferential atrophy of certain organs that may help us in the understanding of undernourishment. Moreover, the discovery of beige adipose tissue has instigated thoughts around the roles played by the different cells in the adipose tissue as well as its adaptability in pathological states. In our study we carried out morphometric, morphological, and quantitative measurements of the adipose tissue in an animal model based on a 40−50% diet restriction in comparison to control animals. We have found a decrease in the size of white adipocytes together with a variation in the lipid droplet size of brown adipocytes in undernourished animals, what may be considered as possible transformations between the types of adipose tissues, and that could be caused by an adaptive phenomenon to the undernourished state.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus possesses ten extracellular proteases with mostly unknown targets in the human proteome. To assist with bacterial protease target discovery, we have applied and compared two N-terminomics methods to investigate cleavage of human serum proteins by S. aureus V8 protease, discovering 85 host-protein targets. Among these are virulence-relevant complement, iron sequestration, clotting cascade, and host protease inhibitor proteins. Protein cleavage sites have been identified, providing insight into the disruption of host protein function by V8. Complement proteins are cleaved within peptidase and sushi domains, and host protease inhibitors are cleaved outside their protease-trapping motifs. Our data highlight the potential for further application of N-terminomics in discovery of bacterial protease substrates in other host niches and provide omics-scale insight into the role of the V8 protease in S. aureus pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The epidermis regenerates continually to maintain a protective barrier at the body’s surface composed of differentiating keratinocytes. Maturation of this stratified tissue requires that keratinocytes undergo wholesale organelle degradation upon reaching the outermost tissue layers to form compacted, anucleate cells. Through live imaging of organotypic cultures of human epidermis, we find that regulated breakdown of mitochondria is critical for epidermal development. Keratinocytes in the upper layers initiate mitochondrial fragmentation, depolarization, and acidification upon upregulating the mitochondrion-tethered autophagy receptor NIX. Depleting NIX compromises epidermal maturation and impairs mitochondrial elimination, whereas ectopic NIX expression accelerates keratinocyte differentiation and induces premature mitochondrial fragmentation via the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) DRP1. We further demonstrate that inhibiting DRP1 blocks NIX-mediated mitochondrial breakdown and disrupts epidermal development. Our findings establish mitochondrial degradation as a key step in terminal keratinocyte differentiation and define a pathway operating via the mitophagy receptor NIX in concert with DRP1 to drive epidermal morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
We present a proteogenomic study of 108 human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Proteomic analysis systematically catalogs HNSCC-associated proteins and phosphosites, prioritizes copy number drivers, and highlights an oncogenic role for RNA processing genes. Proteomic investigation of mutual exclusivity between FAT1 truncating mutations and 11q13.3 amplifications reveals dysregulated actin dynamics as a common functional consequence. Phosphoproteomics characterizes two modes of EGFR activation, suggesting a new strategy to stratify HNSCCs based on EGFR ligand abundance for effective treatment with inhibitory EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Widespread deletion of immune modulatory genes accounts for low immune infiltration in immune-cold tumors, whereas concordant upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint proteins may underlie resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monotherapy in immune-hot tumors. Multi-omic analysis identifies three molecular subtypes with high potential for treatment with CDK inhibitors, anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and immunotherapy, respectively. Altogether, proteogenomics provides a systematic framework to inform HNSCC biology and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is a unique enzyme introducing O-GlcNAc moiety on target proteins, and it critically regulates various cellular processes in diverse cell types. However, its roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain elusive. Here, using Ogt conditional knockout mice, we show that OGT is essential for HSPCs. Ogt is highly expressed in HSPCs, and its disruption induces rapid loss of HSPCs with increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. In particular, Ogt-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose quiescence, cannot be maintained in vivo, and become vulnerable to regenerative and competitive stress. Interestingly, Ogt-deficient HSCs accumulate defective mitochondria due to impaired mitophagy with decreased key mitophagy regulator, Pink1, through dysregulation of H3K4me3. Furthermore, overexpression of PINK1 restores mitophagy and the number of Ogt-deficient HSCs. Collectively, our results reveal that OGT critically regulates maintenance and stress response of HSCs by ensuring mitochondrial quality through PINK1-dependent mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Immunotherapy induces durable clinical responses in a fraction of patients with cancer. However, therapeutic resistance poses a major challenge to current immunotherapies. Here, we identify that expression of tumor stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) correlates with immunotherapy efficacy and is negatively associated with patient survival across diverse cancer types. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that tumor STC1 supports tumor progression and enables tumor resistance to checkpoint blockade in murine tumor models. Mechanistically, tumor STC1 interacts with calreticulin (CRT), an “eat-me” signal, and minimizes CRT membrane exposure, thereby abrogating membrane CRT-directed phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and dendritic cells. Consequently, this impairs APC capacity of antigen presentation and T cell activation. Thus, tumor STC1 inhibits APC phagocytosis and contributes to tumor immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance. We suggest that STC1 is a previously unappreciated phagocytosis checkpoint and targeting STC1 and its interaction with CRT may sensitize to cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to probe the membrane potential of multiple genetically defined neurons simultaneously would have a profound impact on neuroscience research. Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for this purpose, and recent developments have achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio in vivo with 1-photon fluorescence imaging. However, these recordings exhibit several sources of noise and signal extraction remains a challenge. We present an improved signal extraction pipeline, spike-guided penalized matrix decomposition-nonnegative matrix factorization (SGPMD-NMF), which resolves supra- and subthreshold voltages in vivo. The method incorporates biophysical and optical constraints. We validate the pipeline with simultaneous patch-clamp and optical recordings from mouse layer 1 in vivo and with simulated and composite datasets with realistic noise. We demonstrate applications to mouse hippocampus expressing paQuasAr3-s or SomArchon1, mouse cortex expressing SomArchon1 or Voltron, and zebrafish spines expressing zArchon1.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is a stress or damage response that causes a permanent proliferative arrest and secretion of numerous factors with potent biological activities. This senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has been characterized largely for secreted proteins that participate in embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and many age-related pathologies. By contrast, lipid components of the SASP are understudied. We show that senescent cells activate the biosynthesis of several oxylipins that promote segments of the SASP and reinforce the proliferative arrest. Notably, senescent cells synthesize and accumulate an unstudied intracellular prostaglandin, 1a,1b-dihomo-15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2. Released 15-deoxy-delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2 is a biomarker of senolysis in culture and in vivo. This and other prostaglandin D2-related lipids promote the senescence arrest and SASP by activating RAS signaling. These data identify an important aspect of cellular senescence and a method to detect senolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription through noncoding regions of the genome is pervasive. How these transcription events regulate gene expression remains poorly understood. Here, we report that, in S. cerevisiae, the levels of transcription through a noncoding region, IRT2, located upstream in the promoter of the inducer of meiosis, IME1, regulate opposing chromatin and transcription states. At low levels, the act of IRT2 transcription promotes histone exchange, delivering acetylated histone H3 lysine 56 to chromatin locally. The subsequent open chromatin state directs transcription factor recruitment and induces downstream transcription to repress the IME1 promoter and meiotic entry. Conversely, increasing transcription turns IRT2 into a repressor by promoting transcription-coupled chromatin assembly. The two opposing functions of IRT2 transcription shape a regulatory circuit, which ensures a robust cell-type-specific control of IME1 expression and yeast meiosis. Our data illustrate how intergenic transcription levels are key to controlling local chromatin state, gene expression, and cell fate outcomes.

Abstract: The interrelationship between gasotransmitters and oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in lead-induced hepatotoxicity was investigated in this study. On prolonged exposure, lead was accumulated in liver tissue of rats and impaired liver function and structure as assessed by measurement of the serum hepatic function markers and by histopathological examination. The accumulated metal induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the liver. Also, it increased nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level and heme oxygenase (HO-1) concentration in liver tissue. Decreasing of NO production by L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and increasing of H2S level by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and carbon monoxide (CO) level by carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) inhibited lead-induced impairment of liver function and structure. Concomitantly, these agents inhibited lead intoxication-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, nitrosative stress and reduction of HO-1 concentration and H2S level. Furthermore, concurrent treatment with these agents inhibited lead intoxication-induced increase in the protein expressions of inducible NO synthase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and caspase-3 as well as decrease in protein expressions of HO-1 and cystathionine-γ-lyase in the liver. NO donor, l-arginine and H2S and CO biosynthesis inhibitors, trifluoro-DL-alanine and zinc deutroporphyrin, respectively aggravated the toxic effects of lead. These results indicate, for the first time, that there is an interrelationship between gasotransmitters and lead-induced hepatotoxicity. The ability of L-N AME, NaHS and CORM-A1 to provide protective effects against lead-induced hepatotoxicity may positively correlate, to their ability to suppress hepatic oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Voltage-gated sodium channels are targets for many analgesic and antiepileptic drugs whose therapeutic mechanisms and binding sites have been well characterized. We describe the identification of a previously unidentified receptor site within the NavMs voltage-gated sodium channel. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor modulator, and its primary and secondary metabolic products bind at the intracellular exit of the channel, which is a site that is distinct from other previously characterized sodium channel drug sites. These compounds inhibit NavMs and human sodium channels with similar potencies and prevent sodium conductance by delaying channel recovery from the inactivated state. This study therefore not only describes the structure and pharmacology of a site that could be leveraged for the development of new drugs for the treatment of sodium channelopathies but may also have important implications for off-target health effects of this widely used therapeutic drug.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), one of the most prevalent RNA post-transcriptional modifications, is involved in numerous biological processes. In previous studies, the functions of m6A were typically identified by perturbing the activity of the methyltransferase complex. Here, we dissect the contribution of m6A to an individual-long noncoding RNA—metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1). The mutant MALAT1 lacking m6A-motifs significantly suppressed the metastatic potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo in mouse. Super-resolution imaging showed that the concatenated m6A residues on MALAT1 acted as a scaffold for recruiting YTH-domain-containing protein 1 (YTHDC1) to nuclear speckles. We further reveal that the recognition of MALAT1-m6A by YTHDC1 played a critical role in maintaining the composition and genomic binding sites of nuclear speckles, which regulate the expression of several key oncogenes. Furthermore, artificially tethering YTHDC1 onto m6A-deficient MALAT1 largely rescues the metastatic potential of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons depend on proper localization of neurotrophic receptors in their distal processes for their function. The Trk family of neurotrophin receptors controls neuronal survival, differentiation, and remodeling and are well known to function as retrograde signal carriers transported from the distal axon toward the cell body. However, the mechanism driving anterograde trafficking of Trk receptors into the axon is not well established. We used microfluidic compartmental devices and inducible secretion assay to systematically investigate the retrograde and anterograde trafficking routes of TrkB receptor along the axon in rat hippocampal neurons. We show that newly synthesized TrkB receptors traffic through the secretory pathway and are directly delivered into axon. We found that these TrkB carriers associate and are regulated by Rab6. Furthermore, the combined activity of kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 is needed for the formation of axon-bound TrkB secretory carriers and their effective entry and processive anterograde transport beyond the proximal axon.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic cell identities underlie flexible developmental programs. The stomatal lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis features asynchronous and indeterminate divisions that can be modulated by environmental cues. The products of the lineage, stomatal guard cells and pavement cells, regulate plant-atmosphere exchanges, and the epidermis as a whole influences overall leaf growth. How flexibility is encoded in development of the stomatal lineage and how cell fates are coordinated in the leaf are open questions. Here, by leveraging single-cell transcriptomics and molecular genetics, we uncovered models of cell differentiation within Arabidopsis leaf tissue. Profiles across leaf tissues identified points of regulatory congruence. In the stomatal lineage, single-cell resolution resolved underlying cell heterogeneity within early stages and provided a fine-grained profile of guard cell differentiation. Through integration of genome-scale datasets and spatiotemporally precise functional manipulations, we also identified an extended role for the transcriptional regulator SPEECHLESS in reinforcing cell fate commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical synapses of shared cellular origins have remarkably heterogeneous structures, but how this diversity is generated is unclear. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy and artificial intelligence algorithms for image processing to reconstruct functional excitatory microcircuits in the mouse hippocampus and microcircuits in which neurotransmitter signaling is permanently suppressed with genetic tools throughout the lifespan. These nanoscale analyses reveal that experience is dispensable for morphogenesis of synapses with different geometric shapes and contents of membrane organelles and that arrangement of morphologically distinct connections in local networks is stochastic. Moreover, loss of activity increases the variability in sizes of opposed pre- and postsynaptic structures without disrupting their alignments, suggesting that inherently variable weights of naive connections become progressively matched with repetitive use. These results demonstrate that mechanisms for the structural diversity of neuronal synapses are intrinsic and provide insights into how circuits essential for memory storage assemble and integrate information.

Abstract: Background
The inflammatory skin wound response is regulated by argonaute 2-bound microRNAs (Ago2-miRNAs) such as miR-139-5p, which inhibit transcription of their target mRNAs. Jiang Tang Xiao Ke (JTXK) is a traditional Chinese medicine that reduces miR-139-5p expression, suggesting that topical application of JTXK may have effects on wound healing.
Methods
miR-139−/− mice and wild-type (WT) mice were employed to characterize the in vivo effects of miR-139-5p on sterile wound healing. Neutrophil migration and activation into the wound site were examined by live imaging analysis in lys-EGFP mice and myeloperoxidase/aminophenyl fluorescein assays, respectively. In silico and in vitro studies in differentiated HL60 cells were performed to identify miR-139-5p's downstream mediator(s). miR-139−/− neutrophil transplantation (with or without Eif4g2-knockdown rescue) or a topical JTXK gel preparation (with or without miR-139-5p mimic rescue) were employed to characterize the in vivo effects of miR-139-5p and JTXK, respectively, on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-infected wound healing.
Results
miR-139−/− mice display impaired sterile wound healing but improved S. aureus-infected wound healing. Eif4g2, a protein that supports neutrophil proliferation and differentiation, was identified as a key downstream mediator of miR-139-5p. miR-139−/− mice show elevated neutrophilic activation and Eif4g2 upregulation. miR-139−/− neutrophils enhanced S. aureus-infected wound healing in an Eif4g2-dependent manner. Moreover, topical JTXK gel therapy also enhanced S. aureus-infected wound healing in a miR-139-5p-dependent manner.
Conclusions
miR-139-5p negatively regulates the neutrophilic response during S. aureus-infected wound healing, suggesting that JTXK or other miR-139-5p suppressants may be effective for treating infected skin wounds.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial pneumonia is a global healthcare burden, and unwarranted inflammation is suggested as an important cause of mortality. Optimum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are essential to reduce inflammation and improve survival in pneumonia. Elevated levels of the mitochondrial-DAMP cardiolipin (CL), reported in tracheal aspirates of pneumonia patients, have been shown to block IL-10 production from lung MDSCs. Although CL-mediated K107 SUMOylation of PPARγ has been suggested to impair this IL-10 production, the mechanism remains elusive. We identify PIAS2 to be the specific E3-SUMOligase responsible for this SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify a concomitant CL-mediated PPARγ S112 phosphorylation, mediated by JNK-MAPK, to be essential for PIAS2 recruitment. Furthermore, using a clinically tested peptide inhibitor targeting JNK-MAPK, we blocked these post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PPARγ and rescued IL-10 expression, improving survival in murine pneumonia models. Thus, we explore the mechanism of mito-DAMP-mediated impaired lung inflammation resolution and propose a therapeutic strategy targeting PPARγ PTMs.

Abstract: Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the most ubiquitous channel at the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is believed to be the pathway for calcium entering or leaving the mitochondria. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of how VDAC regulates calcium influx and efflux from the mitochondria is of particular interest for mitochondrial physiology. When the Parkinson’s disease (PD) related neuronal protein, alpha-synuclein (αSyn), is added to the reconstituted VDAC, it reversibly and partially blocks VDAC conductance by its acidic C-terminal tail. Using single-molecule VDAC electrophysiology of reconstituted VDAC we now demonstrate that, at CaCl2 concentrations below 150 mM, αSyn reverses the channel’s selectivity from anionic to cationic. Importantly, we find that the decrease in channel conductance upon its blockage by αSyn is hugely overcompensated by a favorable change in the electrostatic environment for calcium, making the blocked state orders-of-magnitude more selective for calcium and thus increasing its net flux. -Our findings with higher calcium concentrations also demonstrate that the phenomenon of “charge inversion” is taking place at the level of a single polypeptide chain. Measurements of ion selectivity of three VDAC isoforms in CaCl2 gradient show that VDAC3 exhibits the highest calcium permeability among them, followed by VDAC2 and VDAC1, thus pointing to isoform-dependent physiological function. Mutation of the E73 residue – VDAC1 purported calcium binding site – shows that there is no measurable effect of the mutation in either open or αSyn-blocked VDAC1 states. Our results confirm VDACs involvement in calcium signaling and reveal a new regulatory role of αSyn, with clear implications for both normal calcium signaling and PD-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Implantation is a hallmark of mammalian embryogenesis during which embryos establish their contacts with the maternal endometrium, remodel, and undertake growth and differentiation. The mechanisms and sequence of events through which embryos change their shape during this transition are largely unexplored. Here, we show that the first extraembryonic lineage, the polar trophectoderm, is the key regulator for remodeling the embryonic epiblast. Loss of its function after immuno-surgery or inhibitor treatments prevents the epiblast shape transitions. In the mouse, the polar trophectoderm exerts physical force upon the epiblast, causing it to transform from an oval into a cup shape. In human embryos, the polar trophectoderm behaves in the opposite manner, exerting a stretching force. By mimicking this stretching behavior in mouse embryogenesis, we could direct the epiblast to adopt the disc-like shape characteristic of human embryos at this stage. Thus, the polar trophectoderm acts as a conserved regulator of epiblast shape.

Abstract: Summary
In some free-living and pathogenic bacteria, problems in the synthesis and assembly of early flagellar components can cause cell-division defects. However, the mechanism that couples cell division with the flagellar biogenesis has remained elusive. Herein, we discover the regulator MadA that controls transcription of flagellar and cell-division genes in Caulobacter crescentus. We demonstrate that MadA, a small soluble protein, binds the type III export component FlhA to promote activation of FliX, which in turn is required to license the conserved σ54-dependent transcriptional activator FlbD. While in the absence of MadA, FliX and FlbD activation is crippled, bypass mutations in FlhA restore flagellar biogenesis and cell division. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MadA safeguards the divisome stoichiometry to license cell division. We propose that MadA has a sentinel-type function that senses an early flagellar biogenesis event and, through cell-division control, ensures that a flagellated offspring emerges.

Abstract: Summary
ATR checkpoint signaling is crucial for cellular responses to DNA replication impediments. Using an optogenetic platform, we show that TopBP1, the main activator of ATR, self-assembles extensively to yield micrometer-sized condensates. These opto-TopBP1 condensates are functional entities organized in tightly packed clusters of spherical nano-particles. TopBP1 condensates are reversible, occasionally fuse, and co-localize with TopBP1 partner proteins. We provide evidence that TopBP1 condensation is a molecular switch that amplifies ATR activity to phosphorylate checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and slow down replication forks. Single amino acid substitutions of key residues in the intrinsically disordered ATR activation domain disrupt TopBP1 condensation and consequently ATR/Chk1 signaling. In physiologic salt concentration and pH, purified TopBP1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. We propose that the actuation mechanism of ATR signaling is the assembly of TopBP1 condensates driven by highly regulated multivalent and cooperative interactions.

Abstract: Brontocoris tabidus (Signoret) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is a zoophytophagous insect used for biological control in agriculture and forest systems because its nymphs and adults feed on insects and plants. The predatory Pentatomidae insert the mouthparts into the prey, releasing saliva to paralysis and kills the insect, as well as digest body parts to be sucked in a preliminary extra-oral digestion. In a short period of time, this insect shows the ability to feed again, suggesting the existence of a constant and abundant secretory cycle in the salivary glands. This study evaluated the morphological, histochemical and ultrastructural changes of the salivary glands of B. tabidus in fed and starved insects. The salivary complex of this predatory bug has a pair of bilobed salivary glands and a pair of tubular accessory salivary glands. The accessory glands have the lumen lined by a thick non-cuticular layer rich in glycoproteins. The secretory cells of the B. tabidus principal salivary glands have constant secretory activity, with each lobe producing different substances. The physiological processes that occur in the salivary gland of B. tabidus indicate that the insect needs to feed constantly, corroborating the potential of this insect to be used in biological control programs.

Abstract: Summary
A father’s lifestyle impacts offspring health; yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that a diet that changes methyl donor availability will alter the sperm and embryo epigenomes to impact embryonic gene expression and development. Here, we demonstrate that a folate-deficient (FD) diet alters histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in sperm at developmental genes and putative enhancers. A subset of H3K4me3 alterations in sperm are retained in the pre-implantation embryo and associated with deregulated embryonic gene expression. Using a genetic mouse model in which sires have pre-existing altered H3K4me2/3 in sperm, we show that a FD diet exacerbates alterations in sperm H3K4me3 and embryonic gene expression, leading to an increase in developmental defect severity. These findings imply that paternal H3K4me3 is transmitted to the embryo and influences gene expression and development. It further suggests that epigenetic errors can accumulate in sperm to worsen offspring developmental outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical fatty acid metabolism describes specific enzyme-substrate interactions that result in products with well-defined chain lengths, degree(s), and positions of unsaturation. Deep profiling of lipids across a range of prostate cancer cell lines reveals a variety of fatty acids with unusual site(s) of unsaturation that are not described by canonical pathways. The structure and abundance of these unusual lipids correlate with changes in desaturase expression and are strong indicators of cellular phenotype. Gene silencing and stable isotope tracing demonstrate that direct Δ6 and Δ8 desaturation of 14:0 (myristic), 16:0 (palmitic), and 18:0 (stearic) acids by FADS2 generate new families of unsaturated fatty acids (including n-8, n-10, and n-12) that have rarely—if ever—been reported in human-derived cells. Isomer-resolved lipidomics reveals the selective incorporation of these unusual fatty acids into complex structural lipids and identifies their presence in cancer tissues, indicating functional roles in membrane structure and signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Novel influenza A virus (IAV) strains elicit recall immune responses to conserved epitopes, making them favorable antigenic choices for universal influenza virus vaccines. Evaluating these immunogens requires a thorough understanding of the antigenic sites targeted by the polyclonal antibody (pAb) response, which single-particle electron microscopy (EM) can sensitively detect. In this study, we employ EM polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to extensively characterize the pAb response to hemagglutinin (HA) after H5N1 immunization in humans. Cross-reactive pAbs originating from memory B cells immediately bound the stem of HA and persisted for more than a year after vaccination. In contrast, de novo pAb responses to multiple sites on the head of HA, targeting previously determined key neutralizing sites on H5 HA, expanded after the second immunization and waned quickly. Thus, EMPEM provides a robust tool for comprehensively tracking the specificity and durability of immune responses elicited by novel universal influenza vaccine candidates.

Abstract: Summary
The integrity of the kidney filtration barrier essentially relies on the balanced interplay of podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Here, we show by analysis of in vitro and in vivo models that a loss of the podocyte-specific FERM-domain protein EPB41L5 results in impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. By using quantitative proteomics analysis of the secretome and matrisome, we demonstrate a shift in ECM composition characterized by diminished deposition of core GBM components, such as LAMA5. Integrin adhesome proteomics reveals that EPB41L5 recruits PDLIM5 and ACTN4 to integrin adhesion complexes (IACs). Consecutively, EPB41L5 knockout podocytes show insufficient maturation of integrin adhesion sites, which translates into impaired force transmission and ECM assembly. These observations build the framework for a model in which EPB41L5 functions as a cell-type-specific regulator of the podocyte adhesome and controls a localized adaptive module in order to prevent podocyte detachment and thereby ensures GBM integrity.

Abstract: Summary
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) is a giant enzymatic assembly involved in pyruvate oxidation. PDHc components have been characterized in isolation, but the complex’s quaternary structure has remained elusive due to sheer size, heterogeneity, and plasticity. Here, we identify fully assembled Chaetomium thermophilum α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes in native cell extracts and characterize their domain arrangements utilizing mass spectrometry, activity assays, crosslinking, electron microscopy (EM), and computational modeling. We report the cryo-EM structure of the PDHc core and observe unique features of the previously unknown native state. The asymmetric reconstruction of the 10-MDa PDHc resolves spatial proximity of its components, agrees with stoichiometric data (60 E2p:12 E3BP:∼20 E1p: ≤ 12 E3), and proposes a minimum reaction path among component enzymes. The PDHc shows the presence of a dynamic pyruvate oxidation compartment, organized by core and peripheral protein species. Our data provide a framework for further understanding PDHc and α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex structure and function.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy deficiency in fed conditions leads to the formation of protein inclusions highlighting the contribution of this lysosomal delivery route to cellular proteostasis. Selective autophagy pathways exist that clear accumulated and aggregated ubiquitinated proteins. Receptors for this type of autophagy (aggrephagy) include p62, NBR1, TOLLIP, and OPTN, which possess LC3-interacting regions and ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs), thus working as a bridge between LC3/GABARAP proteins and ubiquitinated substrates. However, the identity of aggrephagy substrates and the redundancy of aggrephagy and related UBD-containing receptors remains elusive. Here, we combined proximity labeling and organelle enrichment with quantitative proteomics to systematically map the autophagic degradome targeted by UBD-containing receptors under basal and proteostasis-challenging conditions in human cell lines. We identified various autophagy substrates, some of which were differentially engulfed by autophagosomal and endosomal membranes via p62 and TOLLIP, respectively. Overall, this resource will allow dissection of the proteostasis contribution of autophagy to numerous individual proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental multi-step cellular process that culminates in the formation of ribosomal subunits, whose production and modification are regulated by numerous biogenesis factors. In this study, we analyze physiologic prokaryotic ribosome biogenesis by isolating bona fide pre-50S subunits from an Escherichia coli strain with the biogenesis factor ObgE, affinity tagged at its native gene locus. Our integrative structural approach reveals a network of interacting biogenesis factors consisting of YjgA, RluD, RsfS, and ObgE on the immature pre-50S subunit. In addition, our study provides mechanistic insight into how the GTPase ObgE, in concert with other biogenesis factors, facilitates the maturation of the 50S functional core and reveals both conserved and divergent evolutionary features of ribosome biogenesis between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Osteosarcoma is the most common pediatric and adult primary malignant bone cancer. Curative regimens target the folate pathway, downstream of serine metabolism, with high-dose methotrexate. Here, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serine from glucose, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), is examined, and an inverse correlation between PHGDH expression and relapse-free and overall survival in osteosarcoma patients is found. PHGDH inhibition in osteosarcoma cell lines attenuated cellular proliferation without causing cell death, prompting a robust metabolic analysis to characterize pro-survival compensation. Using metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, cellular response to PHGDH inhibition is identified as accumulation of unsaturated lipids, branched chain amino acids, and methionine cycle intermediates, leading to activation of pro-survival mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Increased mTORC1 activation sensitizes cells to mTORC1 pathway inhibition, resulting in significant, synergistic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Identifying a therapeutic combination for PHGDH-high cancers offers preclinical justification for a dual metabolism-based combination therapy for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
The fine-scale dynamics from euchromatin (EC) to facultative heterochromatin (fHC) has remained largely unclear. Here, we focus on Xist and its silencing initiator Tsix as a paradigm of transcription-mediated conversion from EC to fHC. In mouse epiblast stem cells, induction of Tsix recapitulates the conversion at the Xist promoter. Investigating the dynamics reveals that the conversion proceeds in a stepwise manner. Initially, a transient opened chromatin structure is observed. In the second step, gene silencing is initiated and dependent on Tsix, which is reversible and accompanied by simultaneous changes in multiple histone modifications. At the last step, maintenance of silencing becomes independent of Tsix and irreversible, which correlates with occupation of the −1 position of the transcription start site by a nucleosome and initiation of DNA methylation introduction. This study highlights the hierarchy of multiple chromatin events upon stepwise gene silencing establishment.
