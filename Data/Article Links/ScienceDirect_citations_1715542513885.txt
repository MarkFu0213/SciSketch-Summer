Abstract: We find it necessary to contribute by the addendum to a serious and objective scientific discussion on the relationship between Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity with the change of doping amount. In the comment, we argue that Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity of the solid materials must theoretically vary simultaneously with the changing doping amount as this phenomenon has been observed in previous publications [1–4]. However, in the recent report (Solar Energy Materials & Solar Cells, 2018, 182, 302–313),αand ρ show a negative correlation with changing doping amount, which is invalid conclusion because it is based on a mistake. Apart from the wrong correlation, we also contend that the formula used to calculate the ZT was wrongly stated (from line 3 to line 9 on page 304)[5], which introduces doubts about their results. The figure of merit of thermoelectric material is given by ZT=α2σκT, where α is the Seebeck coefficient; σ is the electrical conductivity; κ is the thermal conductivity; T is the absolute temperature. We equally observe a considerable discrepancy between descriptions and experimental results as demonstrated from line 1 to line 7 on page 307, which disagrees with Figs. 6 and 7 in Ref. 5.

Abstract: Objective/background
Clinical predictors of delayed engraftment following autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) are poorly described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to identify pretransplant characteristics contributing to delayed engraftment (DE) following AHCT.
Methods
A retrospective, single institution study of 1162 consecutive patients undergoing AHCT from January 1996 to August 2016 was studied for DE. DE was defined as platelet count ≤ 50,000/µl, hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL, or absolute neutrophil count ≤ 1000/mm3.
Results
Of the 1162 AHCT recipients, 263 (22.6%) were identified as having DE at 30-days post-AHCT with 80.0% being solely due to delayed platelet engraftment. Patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represented 18% of the original cohort, but accounted for 45% of those with DE, whereas multiple myeloma patients represented 59% of the initial cohort, but only 29% of those that had DE. At 3 months post-AHCT, transfusion dependence (p = .0083) prior to AHCT, low-infused CD34+ cell dose < 3 × 106/kg (p = .0012), and low preAHCT platelet count < 150 × 103/µL (p = .0027) were significantly associated with delayed engraftment.
Conclusion
Transfusion dependence prior to AHCT, pre-AHCT platelet count, and CD34+ cell dose were the strongest predictors of delayed engraftment in patients undergoing AHCT.

Abstract: The design and synthesis of solar steam generation materials is a green and promising approach to produce freshwater from seawater or contaminated water. Here, we develop a highly efficient and stable bilayer evaporator by assembling WO3-x nanorods (WO3-x NRs) onto a wood surface. Due to the broad-band absorption of the WO3-x NRs and the multiscatter of the incident light caused by the wood, the prepared solar evaporator with unique light trapping structures shows a high solar absorption (~94.0%). Additionally, combining with the merits of rapid water transport and heat localization, the energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator reaches as high as 82.5% under one sun irradiation and shows a stable water generation capability during long-term illumination cycles, which is one of the best performance compared with other wood-based materials and oxygen-defected tungsten oxide. The evaporator also shows great performance towards the evaporation of seawater and contaminated water, indicating great potential application. This work can provide reference for designing other high photothermal conversion system.

Abstract: For boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), metal oxide (CoO) has been prepared via a facile mean and applied for CE materials in CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs. The electrochemical properties of the CoO counter electrode (CE) and photovoltaic performances of QDSSCs are investigated in detail. Under analogous sunlight illumination, compared with traditional Cu2S CE, the QDSSCs fabricated with CoO CE showed an obvious enhancement in cell properties and increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 32.7%. A PCE of 6.02% was achieved by the QDSSCs with CoO CEs, which deliver a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.42 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.655 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.45. Research so far has shown that metal oxide (e.g. CoO) has many excellent properties, such as good electrical conductivity, outstanding catalytic activity, relatively small charge transfer resistance, large surface area and cost-effective, so it is very promising to be a CE material for QDSSCs.

Abstract: Halide perovskites have shown great potential in photocatalytic applications. In order to enhance the charge transportation efficiency, the chemical stability, and the light absorption ability, we anchored a lead-free halide perovskite (Cs3Bi2I9) on UV100–TiO2 nanoparticles to build a visible-light active photocatalysts. The as-prepared material exhibited excellent stability and a remarkable yield for photocatalytic oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde under visible light irradiation. The photocatalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurement, and photoelectrochemical properties. The analyses confirmed a remarkable improvement of visible-light absorption, a favorable decrease in the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers, and a suitable bandgap for visible-light photocatalytic applications. Recycle experiments showed that the composites still presented significant photocatalytic activity after three successive cycles. A possible underlying mechanism of the composite accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation was proposed. Our study aims to open new possibilities of using lead-free halide perovskites for photocatalytic applications.

Abstract: Nanofluids are considered as promising alternative in heat exchange processes to the classical fluids, which usually present poor thermal properties. One interesting application for nanofluids is as heat transfer fluid in solar thermal applications plants. Boron nitride nanotubes present interesting thermophysical properties for use in nanofluids. Therefore, nanofluids based on boron nitride nanotubes were prepared by a two-step method, dispersing this nanomaterial in a heat transfer fluid typically used. Stability, rheological and thermal properties of the nanofluids were analysed. To check the stability, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and particle size and ζ-potential measurements were performed for a month, obtaining that the nanofluids were stable. Furthermore, surface tension was measured and no significant differences were observed with regard to the base fluid. In a variable range of temperature, nanofluids show Newtonian behaviour with a slight increase in viscosity. Besides, the boron nitride nanotubes caused an increase in thermal conductivity of up to 33% with regard to the base fluid. The use of these nanofluids also led to an improvement in the heat transfer coefficient under turbulent flow conditions of up to 18%. Finally, the analysis of the outlet temperature in solar thermal applications shows that these nanofluids are a promising alternative in this application.

Abstract: Limited air stability circumvents the outstanding properties of the PbTe quantum dots (QDs) and hinders its utilization in the field of optoelectronics. In this respect, we present a detailed understanding on the instability of the PbTe QDs and develop a combinatorial passivation protocol based on engineering the QD surface during the growth phase and solid state ligand exchange process. The dual passivation approach yields thin films and solar cells with outstanding stabilities under ambient conditions. Prioritization of the effects of the synthetic conditions with a systematic approach discloses the crucial roles of the size, shape and stabilizing ligand/catalyst concentration on the stability. Our findings show that the stability diminishes beyond a critical size (3.6–3.9 nm) where the shape changes from octahedron to truncated octahedron. We discovered that the catalyst is a major source of the instability and optimization of its concentration leads to the smallest, extremely air stable PbTe QDs with a size less than 2 nm. We illustrate that the mid gap state formation (MGS), indispensable for any ligand exchange processes, can only be inhibited by using QDs whose capacity to withstand the severe conditions of the exchange process is improved by passivating in-situ. In-situ growth phase passivation not only control the shape by dictating the {111}/{200} facet ratio but also controls the ligand exchange rate, packing direction and MGS formation. The combinatorial passivation strategy yields air stable solar cells with a 100% increase in the efficiency and up to a fivefold increase in the short circuit current.

Abstract: Indium tin oxide (ITO)-based multilayer structures with ultrathin silver (Ag) deposition on colorless polyimide (CPI) were investigated as touch sensor electrode materials in this study. The electrical, optical, structural, and morphological properties of the ITO-based multilayer structures were compared. The figure of merit of the ITO/Ag/ITO(160)/CPI multilayer structure (bottom ITO film deposited at 160 °C), in which the bottom ITO layer was deposited at 160 °C, was calculated using Haacke's formula, and the value was found to be 63.6 × 10−3 Ω−1. Moreover, the sheet resistance and optical transmittance at 550 nm were 6.4 Ω/□ and 91.4%, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy measurements demonstrated that the continuous Ag layer had a uniform film of 10.9 nm. When an ITO/Ag/ITO(160) multilayer structure was used as a substitute for an X–Y ITO layer electrode for fabricating a flexible capacitive-type touch screen panel (FCTSP) and a low-refractive-index silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer was used as the passivation layer, the ultra-high optical transmittance of the SiO2/ITO/Ag/ITO(160) multilayer structure was measured to be 94.6% (at 550 nm), and the average optical transmittance over the visual region (400–700 nm) was measured to be 92.2%. An FCTSP with multiple touch points was successfully fabricated using an X–Y ITO/Ag/ITO(160) multilayer electrode and SiO2 passivation layer. Finally, we also derive the related theoretical formulas to fix our experimental data. Moreover, based on the theory, we can predict the optimized thickness to support the desirable ultra-high transparency of multilayer structures. This auxiliary simulation also paves an alternative route to explore the possibilities of optimized multilayer flexible devices.

Abstract: Raising urban albedo increases the fraction of incident sunlight returned to outer space, cooling cities and their buildings. We evaluated the angular distribution of solar radiation incident on exterior walls in 17 U S. climates to develop performance parameters for solar-retroreflective walls, then applied first-principle physics and ray-tracing simulations to explore designs. Our analysis indicates that retroreflective walls must function at large incidence angles to reflect a substantial portion of summer sunlight, and that this will be difficult to attain with materials that rely on total internal reflection. Gonio-spectrophotometer measurements of the solar spectral bi-directional reflectivity of a bicycle reflector showed little to no retroreflection at large incidence angles. Visual comparisons of retroreflection to specular first-surface reflection for four different retroreflective safety films using violet and green lasers suggest their retroreflection to be no greater than 0.09 at incidence angles up to 45°, and no greater than 0.30 at incidence angles of up to 70°. Attempts to produce a two-surface retroreflector with orthogonal mirror grooves by cutting and polishing an aluminum block indicate that residual surface roughness impedes retroreflection. Ongoing efforts focus on forming orthogonal surfaces with aluminized Mylar film, a material with very high specular reflectance across the solar spectrum. We investigated (1) folding or stamping a free film; (2) adhering the film to a pre-shaped substrate; or (3) attaching the film to a flat ductile substrate, then shaping. The latter two methods were more successful but yielded imperfect right angles.

Abstract: Due to their enhanced thermophysical properties, encapsulated phase change materials have gained attention in solar thermal energy storage applications. In this work, we report the encapsulation of an optimized concentration of solar salt (60:40 of NaNO3: KNO3) in silica shell through the sol-gel technique. In this process, the size and quality of capsules are governed by the stirring rate and duration as well as the pH level of the solution. We investigated the effect of each parameter separately and successfully encapsulated the salt with 24 h of stirring at 600 rpm and pH level between 2.6 and 3.0. We showed that encapsulation increases the thermal conductivity of this material by 51% and does not affect its phase change temperature. However, its latent heat of melting and solidification reduced by 25.38 kJ/kg (19%) and 17.29 kJ/kg (16.6%) respectively at an encapsulation level of 80.94%. The subcooling temperature also decreased by 10.5% after encapsulating the salt. The thermophysical property studies indicate the encapsulated eutectic nitrate salt as possible PCM for solar energy storage applications.

Abstract: Cheap and efficient encapsulation methods are needed for successful commercialization of organic photovoltaics (OPV). Application of epoxy or acrylic UV-curable adhesives is a fast and scalable way to encapsulate organic solar cells. Despite lower barrier properties, acrylates have some benefits over epoxies such as higher cure speed, better adhesion to various substrates, lower viscosity and increased mechanical flexibility. In this work commercial and novel acrylic monomers were applied for encapsulation of OPV. It was found that monomers with phenyl ethyl ester group can have very high adhesion to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), good barrier properties and good compatibility with a layer stack of OPV devices.

Abstract: G-protein-signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2) belongs to a protein family that regulates activation of G proteins and plays an important role in mitotic spindle orientation. However, the role of GPSM2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still unclear. In this study, it was found that GPSM2 correlates with clinicopathological features and patient’s prognosis in LUAD. Knocking down GPSM2 promoted LUAD cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that GPSM2 knockdown accelerates cell proliferation via the EGFR pathway. These results confirmed that GPSM2 played an important role in LUAD. Moreover, GPSM2, as an independent prognostic factor, may serve as a potential drug target and prognostic biomarker in LUAD.

Abstract: The development of thermal conductive and porous supporting scaffolds is believed to solve the problems of poor shape-stability and low thermal conductivity of solid-liquid transition-type phase change materials (PCMs), which are promisingly used for solar thermal energy storage and management. In this paper, textile-structured carbon scaffolds with flexible shape and high porosity are produced by the direct carbonization of cotton cloth. The carbon textile with versatilely changeable shape can be employed as good conductive and supporting scaffolds for PCMs, and paraffin PCM is evaluated. The composite PCMs exhibit good shape-stability and enhanced thermal transfer properties. The composites can present anisotropically improved thermal conductivity by aligning the carbon sheets in their main yarn direction. The thermal conductivity of the composite with a carbon weight ratio of 16.5 wt% is increased to 0.99 W K-1 m−1 from the main yarn direction and 0.68 W K-1 m−1 from the through sheet direction, which is greatly higher than the value of paraffin (0.25 W k−1 m−1), and the composite show heat capacity of 170 J g−1. With the facile production of flexible and shapeable carbon supporting scaffold, the high thermal storage capability, good shape-stability and high heat transfer property, the composite PCM has great potential applications in solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The dimensions of halide perovskite materials have been tailored for optoelectronic and energy conversion applications. The halide perovskite dimension has reached the ultimate size: the molecular state. In this manuscript, we employ first-principles calculations to understand the dimensional tailoring of halide perovskite materials that combine the molecular state and the three-dimensional (3D) state, focusing on the cesium-based Cs4PbBr6/CsPbBr3 hybrids. The calculations indicate that strong interactions exist between the molecular Cs4PbBr6 and CsPbBr3, and the adsorption of Cs4PbBr6 on CsPbBr3 surfaces depends on surface termination. The impacts of the dimensional tailoring combining the molecular state and the 3D state on the electronic and optical properties of halide perovskite materials are discussed. This study facilitates the fundamental understanding on halide perovskite materials with tailored dimensions.

Abstract: The cross-linked poly (N-methylol acrylamide)/polyethylene glycol (PN-MA/PEG) with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) was prepared by emulsion polymerization as composite phase change material (CPCM). N, N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) was used for crosslinking agent. The prepared CPCM was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), thermal cycle test, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). FT-IR results stated that there is no chemical interaction between PEG and PN-MA. XRD results indicated that the introduction of PN-MA did not change the crystal type of PEG. PEG still exhibits crystallization behavior under the constraints of cross-linked PN-MA. The DSC results indicated that CPCM melts at 26.24 °C with a latent heat of 106.5 J/g and solidifies at 32.56 °C with a latent heat of 104.9 J/g. The TGA results indicated that the CPCM has good thermal stability and is suitable for thermal energy storage application. The results of thermal cycle test indicated that the macroscopic morphology and latent heat of CPCM were almost unchanged after 40 thermal cycles. SEM and TEM results indicated that the microscopic morphology of CPCM was spherical and the particle size distribution was around 145 nm.

Abstract: Passive radiative daytime cooling is a low-cost solution to improve human comfort and reduce the energy demands of cooling on a global scale. We present the first demonstration of direct full-sun daytime radiative cooling using an all-polymer filter that blocks solar irradiance while maintaining high transmittance in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). Warm objects and surfaces radiatively transfer heat through the polymer solar filter to the cold sink of space, decreasing temperatures up to 10 °C during day and night. The polyethylene (PE) filter exploits scattering by size-controlled air pores to maximize reflection of solar photons, while preserving the LWIR transparency inherent to PE. We demonstrated cooling power of over 110 W/m2 for an emissive surface placed beneath the solar filter. Scalable, low-cost manufacturing of a radiative cooling polymer solar filter allows direct full-sun daytime cooling of heat-emitting surfaces in a variety of settings.

Abstract: Halved and shingled solar cells are a powerful technology to reduce cell-to-module losses and ultimately increase the output power of a photovoltaic module. The combination of this approach with high-efficiency silicon solar cells architectures, like heterojunction or passivated contacts solar cells, is a promising option, but comes also with new challenges. In particular, the low level of carrier recombination in these cells makes them highly sensitive to any additional defects, as it is the case for the unpassivated edge created when splitting in half a solar cell. In order to optimize the cutting processes, an accurate method to characterize edge losses, adapted to high-efficiency solar cells, is required. In this work, two approaches are proposed and compared. In the first one, edge losses are modelled with a parallel diode, and the associated recombination current (J02edge) is fitted with current-voltage measurements, as usually done in previous studies. The conditions of application of this method are widely discussed and precisely redefined for an accurate extraction of parameters in the case of high-efficiency solar cells. The second method proposed consists in simply calculating relative losses out of the main current-voltage parameters. We demonstrate that simple estimation of open-circuit voltage (Voc) losses is perfectly adapted to our characterization needs, provided that adapted measurement methodology is applied. Results obtained with both methods are then compared on heterojunction cells and discussed. If these two characterization techniques both provide accurate results for the laser scribing processes tested, the method based on open-circuit voltage loss comparison shows slightly less dispersion. Moreover, this last method does not rely on curve fitting, making it faster and insensitive to modeling issues. The Voc approach appears thus more adapted for a fine optimization of different cutting processes and eventual characterization step implemented in an industrial environment. However, the alternative J02edge method based on curve fitting remains of high interest, for example to compare cell losses obtained with usual values reported in the literature, provided that extraction of this parameter is done with the conditions assessed in this work.

Abstract: Utilizing Si4+ ionized states providing two free electrons per atom, ZnO:Si (SZO) thin films have been grown as a superior transparent conducting oxide (TCO) material ideal for Si-based electronic devices. Energetically favoured substitutional doping of Zn2+ by Si3+ and Si4+ states facilitates increase in concentration (ne) and mobility (μ) of the charge carriers. At increased dopant incorporation at the interstitial sites Si2+ and Si1+ states are proportionally contributed which are not electronically active and act as scattering centres for the existing free electrons. Further, the formation of non-conducting SiOx bonds and their segregation at grain boundaries restrict increase in charge carrier concentration and reduce their mobility. The ideal dopant incorporation in ZnO:Si network accommodates ~1.6 ± 0.07 at.% Si. A minimal resistivity, (ρ)min ~7.16 × 10−5 Ωcm corresponding to the highest mobility, (μ)max ~85 V−1cm2s−1 and superior carrier density, (ne)max ~1.0 × 1021 cm−3 signify a highly degenerate semiconductor characteristic of the SZO films with reduced effective mass of electron, m* ~0.15 m0. Significantly high magnitude of Figure-of-Merit (FoM: Φ) ~9.7 × 10−2 Ω−1, even at moderately low growth temperature ~150 °C demonstrates excellent TCO characteristics of SZO films. The n-SZO/p-Si solar cells reveal increased VOC ~312 mV and JSC ~27.9 mA/cm2 via moderate widening in optical band gap and a significant increase in carrier concentration in the SZO component, respectively. The n-SZO/p-Si heterojunction solar cells with a FF ~0.499 and photovoltaic conversion efficiency η ~4.34% has been obtained with improved SZO layer grown by optimized doping via consumption of Si4+ donor states.

Abstract: Partial shading of monolithically interconnected Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) modules can lead to the formation of reverse bias induced defects. These localized defects permanently reduce the output of the PV module. The formation and propagation mechanisms of these defects is studied. Understanding these mechanisms can help to prevent or mitigate damage due to partial shading of CIGSe PV modules. A propagation mechanism is proposed based on both compositional changes found at the edges of the reverse bias induced defects and differences in observed propagation patterns caused by the lateral voltage drop over the TCO layer.

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of selective epitaxy to mitigate the recombination losses at the p-type contact regions of plated bifacial n-type PERT cells. Following the growth of a 500 nm, 2.5 1019 cm−3 boron doped epitaxial layer at the emitter contact regions defined by laser ablation of the passivating dielectrics, both an increase in Voc (+6 mV) and FF (+1% absolute) are measured in the final cells compared to the reference with a homogeneous diffused emitter. These results come with an average efficiency gain of 0.3 and 0.5% absolute for front and rear side illumination, respectively. If the diffused, blanket emitter in the passivated regions is replaced by a thicker, lowly doped epitaxial profile (3 μm, 5 1018 cm−3) to further reduce recombination, an additional rise in implied Voc after metallization of 10 mV is estimated. This increase would be the result of a reduction in J0,pass, emitter (down to 6 fA/cm2) and J0,plated, emitter (down to 1967 fA/cm2).

Abstract: Fiber-shaped Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSFs) represent one of the most interesting technologies aimed at the light harvesting and the production of electricity for wearable applications. In order to boost DSSFs commercialization, their production costs and environmental impact must be reduced. To this end, a suitable strategy could be to build thin film-based devices endowed with metal-free organic sensitizers, exploiting their higher molar extinction coefficients compared to typical ruthenium-containing organometallic dyes. In this work, three thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based organic dyes, TTZ3, TTZ5 and TTZ7, capable of strongly absorb visible light, were used for the first time to manufacture titanium wire-based DSSFs. DSSFs based on a thin TiO2 layer (5 μm) sensitized with the three organic dyes were prepared and tested and the obtained results show that power conversion efficiencies for the organic dyes (0.80%) are higher than that obtained with the reference N719 dye (0.45%). An efficiency of 0.99% with short circuit current density equal to 3 mA/cm2 was achieved when the TTZ7-based DSSFs were tested in diffuse illumination condition, highlighting the supremacy of these dyes compared to the metal-organic reference. The excellent photovoltaic performances of TTZ dyes were attributed to their better light harvesting properties, resulting in the production of higher photocurrent densities, which was confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The superiority of organic dyes on DSSFs performances compared to N719, shown for the first time in this work, support the real possibility to apply these molecules for the preparation of efficient light-harvesting devices based on thin film photoanodes.

Abstract: The recombinases present in the all kingdoms in nature play a crucial role in DNA metabolism processes such as replication, repair, recombination and transcription. However, till date, the role of RecA in the deadly foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes remains unknown. In this study, the authors show that L. monocytogenes expresses recA more than two-fold in vivo upon exposure to the DNA damaging agents, methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet radiation. The purified L. monocytogenes RecA protein show robust binding to single stranded DNA. The RecA is capable of forming displacement loop and hydrolyzes ATP, whereas the mutant LmRecAK70A fails to hydrolyze ATP, showing conserved walker A and B motifs. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes RecA and LmRecAK70A perform the DNA strand transfer activity, which is the hallmark feature of RecA protein with an oligonucleotide-based substrate. Notably, L. monocytogenes RecA readily cleaves L. monocytogenes LexA, the SOS regulon and protects the presynaptic filament from the exonuclease I activity. Altogether, this study provides the first detailed characterization of L. monocytogenes RecA and presents important insights into the process of homologous recombination in the gram-positive foodborne bacteria L. monocytogenes.

Abstract: A flexible four-junction (4 J) AlGaInP/AlGaAs/In0.17Ga0.83As/In0.47Ga0.53As solar cell with the band gap energy of 1.92/1.53/1.18/0.82eV was fabricated. Taking advantages of aluminum (Al)-contained material as well as metamorphic growth, the design of multiple junction solar cells became much easier and more flexible. In order to accommodate lattice mismatch between two InGaAs sub cells, compositionally step-graded AlGaInAs buffer layers were applied to release the mismatch strain during the inverted metamorphic (IMM) 4 J solar cells growth. A flexible 4 J solar cell on a 50 μm thick polyimide (PI) film was successfully fabricated by using temporary bonding and epitaxial layer lift-off via selective wet chemical etching. A conversion efficiency of 25.76% (AM1.5G) with an open circuit voltage of 3.46V, a short-circuit current density of 9.07 mA/cm2 and a fill factor of 82.14% was obtained without anti-reflection coating (ARC), and it would be higher than 32% by ARC integration. The mass density of the 4 J flexible solar cell was only 467  g/m2, and the specific power was up to 550 W/kg.

Abstract: Heat localization has been proposed as a new strategy to utilize solar energy efficiently. In the past few years, extensive research on heat localization has been limited to solar-steam generation. Many devices have been designed to improve the efficiency of photothermal conversion, but the complex preparation processes and the cycle instability limit its large-scale practical application. Herein, we fixed reduced graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles on a melamine sponge skeleton by a simple coating method. The modified sponge retained the high porosity of the sponge substrate and exhibited photothermal properties and hydrophobicity. Consequently, the modified sponge showed a high solar-steam evaporation efficiency (86.8%) under one-sun irradiation and an excellent adsorption capacity to organic solvents and low viscosity oils (54.0–123.0 g/g). The modified sponge also reduced the viscosity of the heavy crude oil under the driving of solar energy to achieve a high adsorption capacity of heavy crude oil (68.0 g/g under one sun). Because of the excellent mechanical properties of the melamine sponge substrate, the modified sponge had great reusable performances, and met the simple and scalable manufacturing requirements in practical applications. This material provides a new idea for the recovery of heavy crude oil and provides new applications for photothermal-conversion materials.

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the gettering of the in-situ phosphorus-doped polysilicon passivating contact that was realized through plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (PECVD) technology. Interstitial iron (Fei) induced artificially was used as the marker for estimating gettering effectiveness. The factors on gettering effectiveness are studied, including the fabrication procedures and the structures of the polysilicon passivating contact. The research suggests that the heavily phosphorus-doped polysilicon layer serves as the gettering pool for iron atoms. We found that the measures including raising the annealing temperature, extending the annealing time, increasing the thickness and doping concentration of polysilicon, and lowering the SiOx thickness are helping to improve the gettering effectiveness. Moreover, the subsequent hydrogenation promotes the lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage by reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. The advantage of the polysilicon passivating contact is the significant effect on the improvement in bulk lifetime, so that the low-quality silicon wafer has the chance to be used for solar cell fabrication with notably improved performance by using the excellent gettering and surface passivation of the polysilicon passivating contact. In summary, this work confirmed that the PECVD-prepared in-situ doped polysilicon passivating contact is an effective process to remove more than 99.99% bulk Fe contamination with an optimal formation procedure, which was essential for the industrial manufacture for silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Barium disilicide (BaSi2) in thin-film solar cell applications has drawn considerable interest owing to its promising optical and electrical properties. We have achieved an efficiency of 9.9% in p-BaSi2/n-Si heterojunction solar cells, which is the highest performance reported among semiconducting silicide devices; however, this value remains much lower than the theoretical limit as defined by the material's band gap. In this paper, we performed numerical simulations based on Silvaco ATLAS to investigate the effects of defect parameters on the performance of heterojunction solar cells. The defects were modeled by introducing two tail bands around the edge of the conduction and valence bands, and an acceptor-like Gaussian distributed localized energy level within the band gap of BaSi2. The influence of the band tail density of states and the parameters of the localized energy levels on the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and efficiency were evaluated. These results enabled us to reproduce the measured J-V characteristics by simulation. We propose a defect model of p-BaSi2 films to reproduce experimentally obtained current-voltage characteristics of p-BaSi2/n-Si heterojunction solar cell under AM1.5 illumination. Two band tails and one acceptor-like localized energy level reproduce the experimental result.

Abstract: A 50-layer stacked InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) grown on GaAs (100) with a self-organized texture formed on its backside has been fabricated in aim for enhancing the photoabsorption by the QD layers. Since doped GaAs substrate has a large free-carrier absorption, a semi-insulating substrate was used for fabricating the QDSC with backside texture. A micrometer-scale texture was formed by a simple wet-etching in a NH4OH solution. The light scattering at the textured backside surface caused a light trapping effect and resulted in an increased effective optical path length by multiple reflection inside QDSC, and this effect was confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement. The photoabsorption attributed to InGaAs QD layers increased by about 2.4 times compared to QDSC without a textured backside. As a result, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) measured at an air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) spectrum illumination increased from Jsc = 20.9 to 21.5 mA/cm2.

Abstract: Pb-free perovskite solar cells are investigated to eliminate the toxic Pb. However, the Pb-free perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of below 9% has been reported mainly because of low open circuit voltage (VOC). In this contribution, the theoretical analysis of the Pb-free perovskite solar cells with an inverted p-i-n planar structure, where the perovskite is FA0.75MA0.25Sn0.95Ge0.05I3 (Sn–Ge perovskite), was therefore conducted using device simulation. It is disclosed that VOC is positively affected by built-in potential across the perovskite absorber (Vbi). The Vbi is primarily governed by conduction band minimum (EC) of electron transporting layer (ETL) and/or work function of back contact (Φ_BC), where they should not be deeper (lower) than the EC (−3.67 eV) of the Sn–Ge perovskite absorber to avoid the Vbi loss for high VOC. Consequently, the ETL and BC materials in the Sn–Ge perovskite solar cells should be appropriately chosen for both suitable conduction band offset of perovskite and ETL, as well as the difference of the EC of perovskite and Φ_BC, thus developing the device structure and increasing Vbi and VOC for the improved PCE.

Abstract: With a 22.1% efficiency record and the successful results in terms of production yield, CdTe based thin film solar cells are today a competing technology with traditional silicon solar cells. Despite different copper-free back contacts have been applied, Cu is present in all the most performing CdTe devices. On the other hand, it is well known that Cu is a fast diffuser in CdTe, and it heavily influences the devices degradation; thus controlling its concentration is very important. In this paper a study of the influence of copper quantity on the performance of the devices and stability at the back contact is presented. CdTe cells fabricated with a 0.1 nm thick Cu layer are compared to devices fabricated with 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5 nm thick Cu layers. The amount of copper affects the performance and aging of the samples. Moreover an inversion of the bias dependency (solar cells in open circuit or in short circuit under current flow), during the aging, occurs in samples containing a copper layer below a certain thickness, suggesting that another degradation mechanism predominates.

Abstract: Luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) based luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are promising as a new concept for solar energy collection. The reabsorption behavior and the stability are two critical issues for the luminophores in LSCs. Here low-loss LSCs are demonstrated based on silica encapsulated CdSe (core)/CdS (shell) quantum rods (QRs) (QR@silica) with a large effective Stokes shift over 170 nm for the first time. For improving compatibility with polymer matrix and enhancing stability, QRs are encapsulated into silica shells by reverse microemulsion method. The QR@silica LSCs are fabricated by doctor-blading printing process achieving two-layer structure to reduce the reabsorption from the LSCs configuration aspect. Moreover, the self-assembly of QR@silica on the top surface of LSCs leads to more luminescent light from the QRs propagate along the horizontal direction thus improving the edge efficiency of LSCs. Benefiting from the low reabsorption of QRs, two-layer structure and the alignment of QR@silica, the edge efficiency of LSCs has reached as high as 87%, which is 4 times higher than that of silica encapsulated CdSe quantum dots (QDs) (QD@silica) LSCs in the same configurations.

Abstract: Decreasing the thickness of perovskite absorption layer is significant for obtaining semi-transparent, tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices with high performance. However, the light harvesting would be influenced due to the limited absorption. Introducing plasmonic metal nanoparticles into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is regarded as a promising approach on the development of ultra-thin PSCs. In this work, gold nanostars (Au NSs) with strong local electromagnetic field and SnO2 surface modification layer were successfully incorporated into ultra-thin PSCs. This design increased light harvesting and carrier transporting. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the plasmon effect of Au NSs on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs with different thicknesses of the perovskite layer and observed that the deceased thickness of perovskite layer led to more intense PCE improvement as the same Au NSs were introduced. The ultra-thin PSCs with 250-nm perovskite layer show a PCE improvement from 15.34 to 18.50% after Au NSs/SnO2 modification, accounting for a maximum enhancement factor of 20.60%. Simultaneously, the modified PSCs with 400-nm perovskite layer exhibit a best reported PCE of 20.06% for the plasmonic PSCs, with an enhanced factor of 13.70% and enhanced light stability. More importantly, flexible, large area and semi-transparent PSCs were also achieved. The flexible devices show more than 90% of their initial PCE values after 100 bending cycles. Our result promises a facile way for developing efficient, flexible and semi-transparent PSCs with ultra-thin absorption layer.

Abstract: Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have potential toward commercialization because of their high efficiency and low cost. The hole transport layer (HTL) of p-i-n perovskite solar cell is usually made of NiOX. However, the NiOX needs to be processed at 300 °C for 15 min for good hole transport property. This long heating time prohibits the development of continuous commercial process. Thus, a rapid heating process for the NiOX film deposition is critical to realize the commercialization of PVSCs in the future. In this study, we develop a facile method to obtain high quality NiOX films annealed by NIR in a short time of 50 s. A short-wave NIR lamp at 2500 K was used to systematically investigate the effect of NIR intensity on the film quality of sol-gel NiOX. The PVSCs fabricated from NIR-annealed NiOX (NIR-NiOX) film show a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to those fabricated from traditional hot-plate annealed-NiOX (HP-NiOX). In addition, the NIR annealed cobalt-doped NiOX (NIR-Co:NiOX) was synthesized to replace pristine NIR-NiOX. The PCE of PVSCs fabricated from this new NiOX film can be increased from 15.99% to 17.77%, which is due to the efficient hole extraction, less charge accumulation, and reducing Voc loss resulting from the improved hole mobility, reduced interface resistance and well-matched work function. Our study paves a way to fulfill the requirements of low cost and low energy consumption of large scale production of high efficiency PVSCs.

Abstract: The red-shifting absorption of non-fullerene acceptor materials is the most important reason for the increasing efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the low absorption of non-fullerene materials in the short-wave direction and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the absorption spectra for active layer materials are only around 100 nm, which limits the further improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, we report a novel double-cabled material ITLYBT with the same molecular fragments of donor and acceptor moieties. The absorption spectra of ITLYBT are the superimpose of the donor backbones and the acceptor pendants with nearly 200 nm blue-shift caused by the enhanced steric hindrance, which works as an ideal third component for highly efficient ternary PSCs to broaden and complement the absorption spectra of the photoactive layer. By introducing ITLYBT into PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F blend, the ternary device shows enhanced Jsc and Voc, and the over PCE increases from 12.50% to 13.14% due to the optimized phased separation and reduced charge recombination.

Abstract: This study investigated the influence of UV picosecond laser fluence, used to ablate the SiNx antireflection coating for Ni/Cu/Ag plated p-type Si solar cells, on busbar and finger adhesion and cell electrical performance. Surface chemistry was characterised post-ablation and post-pre-treatment in 7:1 buffered oxide etch (BOE) using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurements. Although growth of laser-induced Si oxides increases with increasing laser fluence, these oxides are effectively removed in the BOE pre-treatment and therefore do not impact plated metal adhesion with busbar pull forces of 1.9 ± 0.7 N/mm being achieved when a laser fluence of 0.63 J/cm2 was used to ablate the busbar openings. It is also revealed that the use of high laser fluence leads to a more hydrophobic surface due to reduced residual SiNx, however the complete wetting of the ablated Si surface can be ensured by the use of surfactants in Ni plating electrolytes. Residual SiNx impacts Ni silicidation and reduces the busbar pull force to values of only 0.8 ± 0.5 N/mm when average laser fluences ≤0.45 J/cm2 are used. Finger dislodgement forces are interestingly shown not to be affected by laser fluence and presence of residual SiNx, providing an opportunity to optimise the laser ablation process separately for finger and busbar openings. Finally, it is demonstrated that the use of higher laser fluences does not impact the electrical performance of the Al back surface field cells, with open-circuit voltages of ≥637 mV and fill factors ≥80.4% being demonstrated for cells where the average laser fluence used was varied between 0.35 and 0.63 J/cm2.

Abstract: Objective
The pathogenesis of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in coronary heart disease (CHD) is mediated by exosomes derived from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, little is known about their underlying mechanism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the differentially expressed miRNAs in VSMCs undergoing induced calcification.
Methods
A cellular calcification model was established using the mouse VSMC line MOVAS-1. Calcium deposition was evaluated by Alizarin Red staining. Exosome sizes were determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and exosome morphology was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of exosome and calcification biomarkers was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Differential miRNA profiles were determined by deep sequencing and bioinformatics. Protein levels in VSMCs experiencing interference by a miR-324-3p inhibitor were detected by western blotting.
Results
The MOVAS-1 calcification model was confirmed by Alizarin Red staining and expressional alteration of α-SMA, BMP-2, OPN, and MGP. Exosomes from the calcification model showed expression of exosomal biomarkers and regular exosome diameters, which caused significant calcification in MOVAS-1 cells. In total, 987 and 92 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and downregulated in exosomes from the cellular calcification model as compared with those from MOVAS-1 cells, respectively. Target genes of differential miRNAs were involved in various biological processes such as development, metabolism, and cellular component organization and biogenesis as well as multiple signaling pathways such as protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. The most differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qPCR, which showed that mmu-let-7e-5p was downregulated and mmu-miR-324-3p was upregulated in exosomes from the MOVAS-1 cellular calcification model. The expression of IGF1R was increased, and the expressions of PIK3CA and MAP2K1 were reduced in MOVAS-1 transfected with a miR-324-3p inhibitor.
Conclusion
microRNA profiles were significantly altered in exosomes from VSMCs undergoing calcification.

PRMT6 promotes endometrial cancer via AKT/mTOR signaling and indicates poor prognosis,

Abstract: Arginine methylation plays essential roles in post-transcriptional modification and signal transduction. Dysregulation of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) has been reported in human cancers, yet the expression and biological function of PRMT6 in endometrial cancer (EMC) remains unclear. Here, we show that PRMT6 is upregulated in EMC and exhibits oncogenic activities via activation of AKT/mTOR pathway. The expression of PRMT6 in EMC is much higher than that in the adjacent nontumorous tissues. Elevated PRMT6 expression is significantly associated with higher histological tumor grade and unfavorable prognosis in two independent cohorts consisting of a total of 564 patients with EMC. In vitro data demonstrate that PRMT6 expression was identified as a downstream target of miR-372-3p. Ectopic expression of miR-372-3p downregulates PRMT6. Overexpression of PRMT6 promotes EMC cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of PRMT6 leads to opposite phenotypes. Mechanistically, PRMT6 induces the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in EMC cells. Inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling by MK2206 or rapamycin attenuates the PRMT6-mediated EMC progression. In clinical samples, high expression of PRMT6 was correlated to low expression of miR-372-3p and high expression of phosphorylated AKT. Collectively, our findings suggest PRMT6 may function as an oncogene to promote tumor progression, and be of prognostic value to predict disease-free survival of patients with EMC. The newly identified miR-372-3p/PRMT6/AKT/mTOR axis represents a new promising target for EMC management.

Abstract: Metal oxides are interesting materials for use as carrier-selective contacts for the fabrication of doping-free silicon solar cells. In particular, MoOx and TiOx have been successfully used as hole and electron selective contacts in silicon solar cells, respectively. However, it is of paramount importance that good thermal stability is achieved in such contacts. In our work, we combined i-a-Si:H/MoOx based hole contacts with electron contacts featuring i-a-Si:H/TiOx/low work function metal (ATOM) to fabricate doping-free cells, termed MolyATOM cells. We found that the thermal stability of the ATOM contact was improved when the i-a-Si:H was annealed (300 °C for 20 min in N2) before depositing TiOx (i.e. pre-TiOx annealing), which reduces the hydrogen content in i-a-Si:H by about 27 %rel, and thereby the H-related degradation of the ATOM contact characteristics. Moreover, it was found that reducing the thickness of the low-work function metal on top of the TiOx enhanced the thermal stability of the ATOM contact. With these adaptations, the MolyATOM cell efficiency was improved by 3.5 %abs, with the highest efficiency of 17.6%. Moreover, the cells show improved thermal stability after the above-mentioned pre-TiOx annealing, which is confirmed by annealing tests at cell level as well as damp-heat tests at module level. The insights of this study could be used to tailor other metal-oxide based electron or hole contacts.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Early stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has an excellent outcome. Recent studies focus on decreasing toxicity related to the addition of radiation along with chemotherapy. Real-life reporting of the addition of radiation to chemotherapy is lacking. This study investigates the outcomes obtained from a statewide cancer registry for early stage cHL patients treated with chemotherapy alone (CT) versus patients treated with the combined modality of chemotherapy and radiation (CMT).
Methods
A retrospective study of cHL patients diagnosed and treated was identified using a statewide cancer registry from 2005 to 2014. Patients with early stage disease (I, II) were then grouped on the basis of the presence of B symptoms into favorable and unfavorable groups. Baseline characteristics (age, gender, extranodal involvement, and histology) as well as overall survival were compared for both groups depending on whether they received CT or CMT as first line therapy for their cHL.
Results
A total of 961 patients were identified; of those, 127 were excluded as they received only radiation or another form of treatment. Of the remaining patients, 293 were categorized as early stage favorable cHL (Group 1) and 130 adults were in the unfavorable cHL (Group 2). There were 335 patients with advanced stage cHL (Group 3) and 76 patients in an unknown stage. The 10-year overall survival for Group 1 was 81.3% versus 76.3% for Group 2 and 52.7% for Group 3. For Group 1, 10-year overall survival was 86.7% with CMT versus 75.1% for those receiving CT only (p = .004). For Group 2, there was no difference in 10-year overall survival between the CMT group (80.0%) and CT (72.5%) (p = .73).
Conclusion
While radiation therapy might increase long-term toxicity in cHL, in our large data cohort, radiotherapy consolidation as part of the initial therapy for early stage disease provides superior survival at 10 years, especially in favorable risk cHL.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship of doping density, carrier lifetime, and interface recombination to device performance is critical to designing solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In turn, it is necessary to understand how bulk material composition determines doping density and carrier lifetime. The most efficient kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells have had Cu-poor, Zn-rich compositions, while more stoichiometric compositions have lower PCEs. However, thin films are grown under highly non-equilibrium conditions, complicating fundamental studies. Here we report on a set of CZTSe monocrystals with varied cation stoichiometry, enabling correlation of bulk composition to material and device properties without the complication of grain boundaries or secondary phases. Copper-poor, zinc-rich compositions (Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.77–0.90 and Zn/Sn = 1.17–1.25) yield bulk carrier lifetimes longer than 200 ps and PCE >5%. In contrast, near-stoichiometric compositions, with Cu/(Zn + Sn) > 0.90 and Zn/Sn < 1.15, have carrier lifetimes shorter than 20 ps and PCE <2%. CZTSe/CdS interface recombination velocity has a similar value to the CZTSe surface recombination velocity, with values of 104–105 cm/s determined by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy and transport-recombination modeling. Device modeling reveals the dependence of open circuit voltage (VOC) on doping density, carrier lifetime and interface recombination. For a crystal with low doping density of 1015 cm−3, the maximum VOC is limited by the bulk lifetime. Higher VOC can be attained with higher doping density, but interface recombination becomes more significant with increased lifetime and doping density. These simulations indicate limitations and potential pathways to high performance.

Abstract: Low production cost and simplified process are the prerequisites for large-scale commercialization of highly efficient silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. In this paper, an innovative method of plating process with in-situ seed layer technique is proposed for the metallization of SHJ solar cells. As indicated by the measurements of cyclic voltammetry curves and scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical reduction reaction occurs and results in metal particles randomly distributed on the surface of tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) layer. Given the measurement of Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the metal particles are indium and are electrochemically reduced from the IWO film. These indium particles can serve as the seed layer facilitating the subsequent copper plating process. In order to prevent copper diffusion and enhance the adhesion, nickel plating and alkaline copper plating was applied. As a result, the maximum peeling force of plated copper busbar reaches 4.23 N. This is higher than that of the screen-printed silver busbar (2.31 N). By adopting the in-situ indium-seed-layer based plating process, a cell efficiency of 22.01% was achieved with significantly improved short circuit current density and fill factor. Taking advantage of the in-situ seed layer technique, the all-solution based plating process is simplified and effective without full area seed layer deposition and subsequent etch back step, showing great potential for the copper metallization of SHJ solar cells with reduced cost.

Abstract: Solar vapor generation provides an ideal pathway for water remediation by using abundant natural resource--solar irradiation. Great progresses have been made in increasing solar steam efficiency by macrostructure design and microscopic morphology regulation. Here, we report a stable 1T phase engineering of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for enhanced solar vapor generation. A flower-like 1T/2H MoS2 (1T/2H FMoS2) was developed by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The 1T/2H FMoS2 showed enhanced broadband sunlight absorption covering solar spectrum from 300 to 2500 nm. A high evaporation rate of 1.52 kg m−2 h−1 and 20% increase of the photo-to-heat conversion efficiency compared to that of only 2H MoS2 were achieved for 1T/2H FMoS2 by introducing 1T phase and a hierarchical flower-like structure. More importantly, the 1T/2H FMoS2 possessed benign phase stability with a high phase conversion temperature 253 °C. As a photothermal material, it provides an ideal solar-receiver for high efficient solar clean water generation, to alleviate drinking water crisis and energy risk.

Abstract: Mixed tin (Sn)-lead (Pb) iodide perovskite is considered the most promising low-bandgap photovoltaic material for pursuing both low toxicity and high performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, their performance is still lagging behind the full Pb-based analogues. In PSCs, the hole transport layer (HTL) is one of the most important fundamentals to affect the device performance. Herein, the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 PSCs with an inverted structure were successfully fabricated, where a bilayer structure of CuI/PEDOT:PSS was employed as HTL. It is observed that the CuI/PEDOT:PSS film has a smooth morphology with good interfacial contact and the introduced CuI can partly affect the crystallization behavior of (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 to facilitate high-quality perovskite film growth. Simultaneously, the cascading energy alignment in the device together with the high mobility of CuI provided the efficient hole extraction and transport from perovskite to anode. Besides, the photovoltaic performance was observed to be significantly dependent on the concentration of CuI that determines its thickness, as evidenced by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement. Consequently, by using a double-layer CuI/PEDOT:PSS as HTL with the CuI concentration of 10 mg ml−1, the fabricated PSCs based on 60% Sn perovskite lead to an improved champion power conversion efficiency of ~15.75% with negligible J-V hysteresis. Importantly, the double HTL of CuI/PEDOT:PSS makes the PSCs show improved stability, which is a critical characteristic for the advancement of PSCs.

Abstract: Patients with high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have inferior outcomes compared with patients with low-risk APL, predominantly due to higher risk of early mortality related to hemorrhage. The majority of regimens contain prolonged maintenance, but the impact of this phase is not clear in the era of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). We present a retrospective analysis of 10 patients that were treated for high risk APL based on the consolidation treatment phase of APL 0406 study without subsequent maintenance. With a median follow up of 38 months, all patients remain in remission.

Abstract: In this work, a dataset containing long-term stability data for 404 organolead halide perovskite cells was constructed from 181 published papers and analyzed using machine-learning tools of association rule mining and decision trees; the effects of cell manufacturing materials, deposition methods and storage conditions on cell stability were investigated. For regular cells, mixed cation perovskites, multi-spin coating as one-step deposition, DMF + DMSO as precursor solution and chlorobenzene as anti-solvent were found to have positive effects on stability; SnO2 as ETL compact layer, PCBM as second ETL, inorganic HTLs or HTL-free cells, LiTFSI + TBP + FK209 and F4TCNQ as HTL additives and carbon as back contact were also found to improve stability. The cells stored under low humidity were found to be more stable as expected. The degradation was slightly faster in inverted cells under humid condition; the use of some materials (like mixed cation perovskites, PTAA and NiOx as HTL, PCBM + C60 as ETL, and BCP interlayer) were found to result in more stable cells.

Abstract: Organic phase change materials (PCM, such as paraffin) are broadly used in thermal energy storage systems, especially for the efficient utilization of solar energy and industrial waste heat, whereas their low shape-stability and poor heat transfer performance have hindered the practical applications. In this work, we aim at producing high-performance phase change composites (PCCs) with high, anisotropic thermal conductivity and good shape-stability. The PCCs are supported by a biomass-derived porous carbon scaffolds, which are constructed with graphene-wrapped and vertically aligned hollow carbon fibers. The PCC with a filler content of 8.5 wt% exhibits a high lateral thermal conductivity of 1.36 W m−1 k−1 and an even higher thermal conductivity of 2.68 W m−1 K−1 along the axial fiber direction which is 10.7-fold higher than pure paraffin. The PCCs also show satisfactory shape stability, high latent heat, good thermal cycling and chemical stability. These results demonstrate the potential for fast thermal energy conversion and management using our novel carbon scaffold supported PCCs with tailored anisotropic thermal transfer properties.

Abstract: Electrochromic (EC) energy storage devices that possess characteristics of energy storage and electrochromism are highly desirable and have increasingly attracted research interests, whilst devices that can be stretched or are flexible have received very little attention. Herein, we report a flexible and rechargeable aluminium (Al) ion EC battery (ECB), which consists of a WO3 film as positive electrode, PET/ITO as substrate, Al sheet as negative electrode, aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) aqueous solution as electrolyte, and absorptive glass mat (AGM) as electrolyte carrier and separator. The ECB exhibits a high specific capacity of 142 mAhg−1, while demonstrating reversible color transitions between white (bleached state) and dark blue (colored state) during the cyclic charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the ECB can work at bending angles of 0-80° with a capacity retention of 92.3% after 40 bending cycles. The flexibility of the ECB is ascribed to the flexible, porous, and highly stable features of the AGM as well as the deformability of the PET/ITO substrate. The potential widow of the ECB can be largely enhanced by connecting small-sized ECBs internally in series while maintaining the energy density unchanged. The present study demonstrates that the ECB using the AGM as the electrolyte carrier and separator may have great potentials for the construction of both flexible, portable electronics and smart windows.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate an efficient electron-selective passivating contact with TiOx/LiF/Al contact structure, which offers both low surface recombination and specific contact resistance. Optimized TiOx layer thickness of 4 nm provides high quality surface passivation, achieving minority carrier lifetime of 3.03 ms on 5 Ω cm n-type wafers, with a saturated current density J0 of 23 fA/cm2. In addition, inserting a 1 nm LiF between the 4 nm TiOx and Al reduces the contact resistivity to 18 mΩ cm2. The low contact resistivity of TiOx/LiF/Al contact is attributed to barrier reduction from the low work function of LiF/Al stack. A champion solar cell efficiency of 21.3% has been achieved for an n-type crystalline silicon device with a full-area rear TiOx/LiF/Al contact, demonstrating the excellent potential of this passivating contact for fabricating high-efficiency silicon solar cells.

Abstract: A novel photocathodic composite has been studied towards photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production from water. Copper oxide/indium oxide (CuO/In2O3) thin film photocathodes have been prepared by electrochemical method under various potentials, followed by the thermal treatment. Photocathodes were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with elemental mapping. Under irradiation in alkaline electrolyte Cu/In material showed an impressive cathodic photocurrent, up to 4 mA cm−2, which can be associated with efficient electron-hole pairs separation and low rate of unfavorable recombination. Photogenerated electrons induced a water reduction to hydrogen, as confirmed by gas chromatography. Photoactivity of Cu/In was observed in a broad wavelength range, partially corresponding to the UV–Vis spectrum obtained from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Advanced techniques such as synchrotron-radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy enabled the investigation of materials stability. Under irradiation of Cu/In composite, CuII is partially reduced to CuI, leading to a formation of self-stabilized composite.

Abstract: Rear side application of polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) passivated contacts has demonstrated very high efficiencies for single-junction monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar cells. To further improve the device performance, one possible approach is to apply the passivated contact concept to the front side of the solar cell as well. The front side application requires the use of ultra-thin poly-Si layer in order to suppress parasitic absorption. Suitable ex-situ diffusion process should be developed accordingly without damaging the passivation provided by the very thin interface oxide (iOx). In this work, we prepared symmetric lifetime samples of ultra-thin poly-Si (<30 nm) via low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) method. Then we studied and optimised the ex-situ POCl3/BBr3 diffusion doping processes. An excellent passivation quality was demonstrated with a high implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of up to 730 mV (on symmetric n+ poly-Si lifetime samples) and 700 mV (on symmetric p+ poly-Si lifetime samples). For possible contact formation, we capped the poly-Si with sputter-deposited ZnO:Al, which shows good opto-electrical properties and firing stability at 650 °C.

Abstract: The shape stable phase change materials (SSPCMs) consisting of coal fly ash (CFA) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) are promising candidates for high temperature thermal storage applications, owing to their low price, high melting enthalpy and low corrosivity of K2CO3. Nevertheless, the chemical reactions between K2CO3 and CFA at high temperature limit its application. To solve this problem, in this work, a new two-step method for preparing SSPCMs containing K2CO3 and CFA was proposed. Firstly, the CFA was successfully modified by K2CO3 with a mass ratio of 3:2. The main phase of the modified CFA was changed into potassium aluminum silicate (KAlSiO4). Then the SSPCMs were synthesized using the modified CFA and K2CO3. The latent heat and thermal conductivity of the prepared SSPCMS increased with the increase of salt content. The SSPCMs with potassium carbonate contents of 50 wt% (SSPCM-55) and 60 wt% (SSPCM-46) maintained good shape without cracks after the sintering processes. In addition, they showed a good cyclic stability in the 150 times thermal cycle tests in terms of mass, latent heat and chemical compatibility. The SSPCM-46 showed the best performance considering both heat transfer and energy storage density, and is promising to be used as a low-cost high-temperature PCM.

Abstract: In the search for a hybrid III-V/Si photovoltaic technology, a tandem GaAsP/SiGe solar cell grown on silicon substrate have been developed using SiGe/Ge reverse graded buffers. Reverse buffer layers can be made thinner than conventional designs, favour the reduction of the threading dislocation density and allow the growth of thicker active layers in the same growth time, but also facilitate the appearance of cracks. In this work, experimental results of functional tandem solar cell devices manufactured with this approach and strategies for their optimization are presented.

Abstract: Solar selective absorbers based on semiconducting β-FeSi2 and low-emissive Ag layers were prepared on stainless steel substrates, and the thermal durability below 650 °C was evaluated. Agglomeration and vaporization of the Ag layers were prevented by adding Ta and stacking with TaN layers, respectively. The solar absorbing layers, consisting of β-FeSi2, deteriorated at high temperatures, as a result of diffusion of Si from the silicide layers to substrates, which could be suppressed by using TaN/SiO2 layers at the interface between the stainless steel substrates and Ag layers with Ta and Si additives. The thermally stabilized solar selective absorbers achieved an averaged solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 87.0% between 300 and 650 °C. Arrhenius plots based on accelerated heating tests between 750 and 800 °C showed that the thermally stabilized absorbers were able to keep the decline in efficiency to within 1% for over 42 years at 650 °C.

Abstract: The research of broadband photodetectors has been attracting extensive attention because of their great importance and application potentials in numerous fields. In this study, we proposed a perovskite-based photovoltaic broadband photodetector using silicon nanoporous pillar array (Si-NPA) as the hole-transport layer as well as the growth template. By optimizing the conditions of solvent vapors annealing approach, the conformal growth of high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films was achieved with a high material integrity, thus enabling a rapid and efficient carrier transport at the MAPbI3/Si-NPA interface. The photoresponse analysis reveals that the devices exhibit a high light sensitivity from the deep ultraviolet to the near-infrared region and a pronounced photovoltaic behavior. Typically, a high on/off ratio of 0.82 × 105, a photoresponsivity of 8.13 mA/W, a specific detectivity of 0.974 × 1013 Jones, and fast response speeds of 253.3/230.4 μs were achieved at zero bias under light illumination of 780 nm. Because of the using of air-stable inorganic carrier-transport layers (Si-NPA, ZnO), and the coaxial core/shell heterojunction architecture for a full protection of vulnerable MAPbI3 active layer from exposure to air ambient, the photodetectors without encapsulation can operate with an excellent stability and repeatability in a wide frequency range over 5000 Hz and continuous light switching (1200 cycles). Even after one-month storage in air ambient, the devices can operate properly with only 8% photocurrent decay. The results obtained provide an effective strategy for the design and development of high-performance broadband photodetectors by combining the advantages of perovskites and functional Si-NPA template.

Abstract: We demonstrate an “industrial tunnel oxide passivated contacts” (i-TOPCon) silicon solar cell on large area n-type silicon wafers (156.75 mm × 156.75 mm). This cell has a boron diffused front emitter, a tunnel-SiOx/n+-poly-Si/SiNx:H structure at the rear side, and screen-printed electrodes on both sides. The passivation of the tunnel-SiOx/n+-poly-Si/SiNx:H structure on silicon wafers is investigated. The saturation currents Jo of this structure on polished and textured silicon surfaces are 1.3 and 3.7 fA/cm2, respectively. After printing the Ag contacts, the Jo of this structure increases to 50.7 fA/cm2 on textured silicon surfaces, which is still manageably low for metal contacts. This structure was applied to i-TOPCon solar cells, resulting in a median efficiency of 23.91%, measured in-house, and a champion efficiency of 24.58%, independently confirmed by the ISFH CalTeC in Germany. The champion efficiency was measured with total area illumination, including screen-printed fingers and busbars.

Abstract: Bi2O3 nanoparticles prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are growth on TiO2 films. As catalyst, It is found that the photocatalytic effective is associated with the cycle number of loading Bi2O3 nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of various samples may due to the different size of deposited Bi2O3, which can be observed by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The morphology may attribute to the growth controlling of ALD method. Then, a mechanism is proposed to explain why the compound with 10 cycle Bi2O3 shows the best behavior. Because that the Bi2O3 grown by ALD in several cycles is island, the photocatalytic was further improved by the structure of Bi2O3 nanoparticles/TiO2 films. What's more, the sample had a good stability by keeping a high activity without obvious deactivation after four recycles of the degradation. The result shows that ALD technology has a broad potential application in the field of photocatalytic because its mass industrial production and the achievement of surface improvement in a short time.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction solar cells achieve high conversion efficiency due to the excellent surface passivation provided by the hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon films. However, they require a high-quality wafer as a starting material because their low-temperature processing does not allow for gettering. Czochralski-grown upgraded metallurgical-grade (UMG-Cz) silicon is a low-cost alternative to electronic-grade silicon for silicon solar cells, but is often limited in lifetime by grown-in defects. We have previously shown that pre-fabrication treatments, namely tabula rasa, phosphorus diffusion gettering, and hydrogenation, can significantly improve the bulk quality of UMG-Cz wafers. These help to mitigate the impact of grown-in oxygen precipitate nuclei and metallic impurities. In this work, we fabricate rear-junction silicon heterojunction solar cells on both as-grown and pre-treated UMG-Cz and electronic-grade wafers. We show that pre-fabrication treatments have a marked impact on solar cell efficiencies. With pre-fabrication treatment, the efficiency improves from 18.0% to 21.2% for the UMG-Cz cells and 21.2%–22.7% for the electronic-grade cells. Comparison of the open-circuit voltages of the as-grown and pre-treated UMG-Cz and electronic-grade cells using Quokka simulations reveals that the bulk lifetime remains the primary limiting factor for the UMG-Cz wafers.

Abstract: Hole transport layer (HTL) is important in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to facilitate the hole extraction and suppress the charge recombination for high device performance. Based on the widely used HTL material of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), we proposed a new HTL modification method using the widely available copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN); the doping of CuSCN NH3 [aq] in PEDOT:PSS followed by low-temperature annealing results in reduced energy barrier, improved charge extraction efficiency and increased the mean size of perovskite crystal of the PEDOT:PSS-CuSCN HTL-based inverted PSCs. Significantly improved device performance was observed with open current voltage over 1.0 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 15.3%, which is 16% higher in PCE than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. More impressively, with a lower acidity than PEDOT:PSS, the PEDOT:PSS-CuSCN HTL enables excellent long-term stability of the inverted PSCs, exhibiting almost doubly improved device stability at the same storage condition. Thus, the successful application of CuSCN doping in PEDOT:PSS HTLs should provide a novel approach for the development of high-performance HTLs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

Abstract: As a passive cooling method with no energy input, radiative cooling has great potential in applications like building energy saving. The key to effective radiative cooling lies in selectively controlling the radiative properties in both solar and mid-infrared spectrums, and simple structures based on polymer materials attract growing attentions due to their overwhelming advantages of low cost and large-scalable fabrication. In this study, a dual-layer film consisting of polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) layer and Ag coating is proposed to act as an efficient daytime radiative cooler with low solar absorption and broadband infrared emission. An outdoor test demonstrates that sub-ambient daytime cooling is successfully achieved by the proposed cooler with an equilibrium temperature 2 °C below the ambient under solar irradiation of 950 W/m2. Due to better durability and better performance in anti-staining and corrosion protection than other polymer materials, the demonstrated cooling performance based on the PVF film would facilitate radiative cooling principle in much broader applications.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) that have the ability to convert and store solar energy could take full advantage of clean and renewable energy. However, the large-scale commercial application of PCMs was seriously limited due to the leakage, low thermal energy storage capacity and poor thermal transfer ability. In this work, natural montmorillonite (Mt) has been exfoliated into two-dimensional montmorillonite nanosheets (MtNS) and then being self-assembled into three-dimensional network montmorillonite framework (3D-MtNS), which was applied to encapsulate stearic acid (SA) for the fabrication of composite PCMs to significantly promote solar energy conversion and storage performances. This novel 3D-MtNS framework provides super porosity and huge specific surface area to encapsulate more than 95 wt% SA without leakage, resulting in the highest latent heat capacity (198.78 J/g) among clay mineral based composite PCMs. Besides, the cross-linked MtNS throughout the PCM composites provided rapid heat transfer paths, leading to outstanding thermal transfer ability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performances. In addition, due to the protection of the 3D-MtNS framework, the composite PCMs exhibit superior form stability, thermal stability and cycling stability. Compared with previous prepared clay minerals based composite PCMs, the present 3D-network MMT/SA composite PCMs showed dramatic latent heat capacity and good heat transfer ability simultaneously, which enable the direct solar energy conversion, storage and utilization.

Abstract: Na-doped Cu2SnS3 (CTS) solar cells are fabricated and their carrier recombination is examined. The CTS absorbers on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates are grown by the sulfurization of NaF/Cu–SnS2 (900 nm) precursors. The NaF thickness is varied from 0 to 100 nm to vary the Na content in the resulting CTS absorbers. It is disclosed that the large grain with the uniformity of the material distribution (Cu, Sn, and S) in the Na-doped CTS absorber is obtained. With optimal Na doping (NaF thickness of 60 nm), the open-circuit voltage deficit (VOC,def) is obviously reduced, whereas short-circuit current density deficit (JSC,def) is not varied much. The reduction of VOC,def is attributable to the decrease in the carrier recombination across the device. The conversion efficiency (η) is consequently increased to approximately 4.7%. However, with severe Na doping (NaF thickness of over 75 nm), the VOC,def is clearly increased owing to the increase in the carrier recombination, thereby reducing the η. This is occurs because the Sn2S3 and Na2S secondary phases near the surface of the CTS film are formed with the severe Na doping. To further increase the η, the JSC,def is reduced through the decrease in CdS buffer thickness. Ultimately, the 5.1%-efficient CTS solar cell is obtained with the Na-doped CTS absorber prepared with the optimal NaF thickness of 60 nm.

Abstract: Light- and elevated temperature-induced degradation (LeTID) has been extensively studied on p-type silicon materials with increasing evidence suggesting the involvement of hydrogen. Recent findings of the identical phenomenon in n-type silicon wafers have further opened up new areas of understanding into the inherent behavior and root cause of the defect. In this work, we compare LeTID observed in both p- and n-type silicon wafers under both dark and illuminated annealing conditions, highlighting previously unobserved similarities in defect formation and recovery kinetics. We report thermal activation energies of the LeTID-related degradation and recovery in n-type silicon to be 0.76 ± 0.02 eV and 0.97 ± 0.01 eV without illumination, respectively, and 0.70 ± 0.05 eV and 0.83 ± 0.15 eV under illumination (0.02 kWm−2), respectively. Furthermore, we present additional experimentation demonstrating the thermal and illumination dependency of surface-related degradation (SRD) in n-type silicon. We report an extracted activation energy of this SRD of 0.38 ± 0.10 eV. Through modelling of the hydrogen charge state fractions, we speculate that the behavior of LeTID both in the dark and under illumination may be explained by the migration of and interactions between charged hydrogen species and dopant atoms within the diffused layers and the silicon bulk.

Abstract: Novel microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) with SiO2 coating Na2HPO4⋅7H2O were synthesized by one-pot method. A possible formation mechanism of Na2HPO4⋅7H2O core and SiO2 shell was preliminarily analyzed. The morphology, composition, crystalline phase and thermal performances of the synthesized MEPCM was characterized by scanning electron microscopies (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis (TG) and thermal constants analyzer. Preliminary analysis indicated that the Na2HPO4⋅7H2O nanocrystals as the core was obtained by anti-solvent process with partially dehydration (loss of five crystal water molecules) from Na2HPO4⋅12H2O, and the SiO2 as the shell was formed by sol-gel method with hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate. Analysis results of FT-IR and XRD illuminated that only physical interaction occurred between the SiO2 shell and the Na2HPO4⋅7H2O core in the MEPCM. The results of SEM and DSC showed that the synthesized MEPCM displayed a flat cylinder structure and the particle size of about 8 μm, and exhibited a phase change temperature of 50.12 °C, latent heat of 159.8 kJ/kg and encapsulation ratio of 82.40%. Moreover, the formation of the phase change microcapsules could reduce the supercooling of Na2HPO4⋅7H2O to some degree and the MEPCM displayed a suitable thermal conductivity (0.3838 W/m⋅K) and an excellent thermal stability. The thermal properties of the MEPCM make it suitable for solar energy storage.

Abstract: Modelling of solar radiation propagation and absorption in porous media is a crucial part in the modelling of porous volumetric receivers in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The radiative properties of the porous media should be known in detail for accurate receiver modelling. In this work, an experimental study and a numerical model are combined aiming to estimate the asymmetry factor of Henyey-Greenstein (HG) scattering phase function in the visible spectral range for porous volumetric receivers made of open-cell silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic foam. For the experimental, the hemispherical diffuse reflectance of five different samples is measured using a collimated light source and an integrating sphere. For the numerical modelling, an algorithm based on a three-dimensional Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method was developed to simulate radiation propagation and absorption in porous media for the same conditions of the experimental apparatus. The asymmetry factor is determined by adjusting its value in the numerical model in order to minimize the difference between measured and simulated values. Results show that the solar radiation scattering in open-cell SiC ceramic foams is slightly backwards, being the optimum asymmetry factor of the Henyey-Greenstein phase function approximately −0.25, with a mean bias error of 0.0045% and a root mean square difference of 0.2926% between modelled and measured values of diffuse reflectance. Experimental results were also compared with the phase function for packing of spheres and with the isotropic scattering phase function. The first overpredicts the diffuse reflectance, while the second function underpredicts it.

Abstract: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a highly complex procedure that requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team to optimize its safety. In addition, institutions may have different needs regarding indications based on regional disease prevalence or may have an interest in developing specialized services. Yet, structured recommendations are not commonly available. Here, the Transplant Center and Recipient Issues Standing Committee for the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) organized a structured review of all pertinent elements to establish a transplant program. First, we solicited components from committee members and grouped them in domains (infrastructure, staff, cell processing laboratory, blood banking, laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, HLA testing, ancillary services and quality). Subsequently, reviewers scored all elements on a 7-point scale, from an absolute requirement (score of 1) to not required (score of 7). An independent group of five experienced transplant physicians reviewed the rankings. Minimum requirements to establish any HCT program were identified among elements with mean score of ≤2.0, and specific elements for allogeneic and autologous HCT were identified. Mean scores >2.0–4.0 were classified as preferred recommendation, and mean scores of >4.0 to ≤7.0 were considered ideal recommendations for advanced and complex types of transplantation. This structured set of recommendations guides the prioritization of minimum requirements to establish a transplant program and to set the path for expansion and further development.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition-metal carbides/carbonitrides (MXenes) have demonstrated wide application prospect in energy conversion and storage, mostly in the form of electrochemical energy storage. Compared with the conversion between chemical energy and electrical energy, an energy conversion process initiated by solar energy and driven by the physical change of energy materials will be a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy. Therefore, a high-performance MXene aerogel-based phase change material for solar energy conversion and thermal energy storage is constructed. MXene nanosheets with an extinction coefficient of 25.67 L/(g.cm) at 808 nm demonstrate excellent light absorption performance, which can spontaneously convert the solar energy into thermal energy. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) possessing high affinity with MXene acts the medium for thermal energy storage and release in the process of fusion and solidification. The MXene@PEG aerogels are lightweight, with a density about 30 mg/cm3. The MXene skeleton is introduced as supporting materials to keep the shape of MXene@PEG aerogel stable during the phase change process. The MXene nanosheets improve the thermal stability of PEG, the thermal decomposition temperatures can be increased by 40 °C. The actual fusion and solidification enthalpies of MXene@PEG aerogels can reach 167.72 and 141.51 J/g, respectively. The photothermal storage efficiency of MXene@PEG aerogels reaches a relatively high value of 92.5%. This work provides a new type of scaffold for lightweight and shape-stable photothermal carrier and paves the way for the application of non-graphene 2D materials toward solar energy utilization.

Abstract: We demonstrate the synthesis of cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite magic sized clusters (PMSCs) and how to control the transformation from CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) to PMSCs by varying the amount of organic carboxylic acids (CAs), including mesitylacetic acid (MAA), oleic acid (OA), and phenylacetic acid (PAA), along with benzylamine (BZA) as capping ligands at room temperature. The PQDs and PMSCs are characterized by means of XRD, UV/vis, photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved PL (TRPL), and X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The concentration of CAs affects the excitonic absorption of both the CsPbBr3 PMSCs (λ = 389–428 nm) and CsPbBr3 PQDs (λ = 460–516 nm), with high concentration of CAs favoring CsPbBr3 PMSCs over PQDs. With PAA at 45.45 mM, pure CsPbBr3 PMSCs can be generated, which does not happen for MAA or OA, suggesting that PAA is a stronger ligand than MAA and OA. The results suggest that PMSCs require better passivation or stronger ligands than PQDs. This study establishes a simple and general method for synthesizing CsPbBr3 PMSCs using a combination of BZA and CA capping ligands as a highly effective dual passivation system.

Abstract: Characterization of doped silicon layers using infrared spectroscopy is a fast and non-destructive method, but data interpretation requires proper simulation and modelling of the free carrier absorption (FCA) in the mid-infrared wavelength range. This work demonstrates an optical model capable of describing the infrared reflectance and transmittance of silicon solar wafers with pyramidal texture and doped layers. The model's ability to accurately describe a broad variety of samples is discussed.

Abstract: Indium oxide based transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are promising contact layers in solar cells due to their outstanding electrical and optical properties. However, when applied in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 or Si-hetero-junction solar cells the specific roughness of the material beneath can affect the growth and the properties of the TCO. We investigated the electrical properties of hydrogen doped and hydrogen-tungsten co-doped indium oxides grown on rough Cu(In,Ga)Se2 samples as well as on textured and planar glass. At sharp ridges and V-shaped valleys crack-shaped voids form inside the indium oxide films, which limit the effective electron mobility of the In2O3:H and In2O3:H,W thin films. This was found for films deposited by magnetron sputtering and reactive plasma deposition at several deposition parameters, before as well as after annealing and solid phase crystallization. This suggests universal behavior that will have a wide impact on solar cell devices.

Abstract: Muscle glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) is a key enzyme in the first step of glycogenolysis. Mutation in the PYGM gene leads to autosomal recessive McArdle disease. Patients suffer from exercise intolerance with premature fatigue, muscle cramps and myalgia due to lack of available glucose in muscles. So far, no efficient treatment has been found. The zebrafish has many experimental advantages, and was successfully implemented as an animal model of human myopathies. Since zebrafish skeletal muscles share high similarity with human skeletal muscles, it is our animal of choice to investigate the impact of Pygm knockdown on skeletal muscle tissue. The two forms of the zebrafish enzyme, Pygma and Pygmb, share more than 80% amino acid sequence identity with human PYGM. We show that the Pygm level varies at both the mRNA and protein level in distinct stages of zebrafish development, which is correlated with glycogen level. The Pygm distribution in muscles varies from dispersed to highly organized at 72 hpf. The pygma and pygmb morpholino knockdown resulted in a reduced Pygm level in zebrafish morphants, which exhibited altered, disintegrated muscle structure and accumulation of glycogen granules in the subsarcolemmal region. Thus, lowering the Pygm level in zebrafish larvae leads to an elevated glycogen level and to morphological muscle changes mimicking the symptoms of human McArdle disease. The zebrafish model of this human disease might contribute to further understanding of its molecular mechanisms and to the development of appropriate treatment.

Abstract: Alternatively activated macrophages are innate immune cells that contribute to resolution of inflammation and maintenance of homeostasis. Modulation of available fatty acid sources is thought to affect cellular physiology through a variety of mechanisms, including through alterations to the profile of oxygenated free fatty acid metabolites, called oxylipins, produced in a cell type specific manner. Here, we investigated how treatment with the plant-sourced omega-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA) affects the oxylipin profile and functional capacity of a cell culture model of human alternatively activated (M2a-like) macrophages. In a targeted but unbiased screen, ALA enhanced the production of oxylipins from all polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) precursors, with oxylipins derived from ALA being enhanced the most. Consistently, ALA treatment enhanced the expression of both cytoplasmic and calcium-independent phospholipase A2. At a functional level, ALA treatment increased phagocytic activity and altered production of the chemokine MCP-1 by M2a-like cells in a manner dependent on the time of treatment. ALA treatment during polarization increased MCP-1 secretion, which was sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of 15-LOX-1 by ML351. Thus, ALA modulates the phenotype of alternatively activated macrophages, likely through its own LOX-derived oxylipins and/or through general modulation of oxylipin biosynthesis. These effects likely contribute to the overall anti-inflammatory benefit observed with ALA supplementation.

Abstract: In the two-step spin-coating method, the crystallization and morphology of PbI2 film are essential for producing highly efficient and stable planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells. In this work, the dithizone (DTZ) molecules were introduced into PbI2 precursor to improve the performance of perovskite films. We found that adding DTZ was an effective method to retard the crystallization of PbI2 film and consequently, produced a high-quality perovskite film with pinhole-free, smoother, and fewer defects surface. Most importantly, the presence of residual DTZ in wet PbI2 film also assisted DMSO to slow down the growth of perovskite grains. By tuning the concentration of DTZ, the power conversion efficiency of the best performed cell has increased to 20.66% with negligible photocurrent hysteresis. Meanwhile, the best DTZ device offer an excellent stability, which retained 97% of the initial PCE after storage in the dark for approximately 24 days. We expect this controlled crystallization method could be further explored and provides a useful strategy to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The epigenetic silencing mechanism of suppressor 3 of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) in cancers has not been fully elucidated. Polycomb repressive complexes 2 (PRC2), an important epigenetic regulatory factors, exerts a critical role in repressing the initial phase of gene transcription. Whether PRC2 participates the down- regulation of SOCS3 in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear and how does PRC2 be recruited target gene still needs to explore. In this study, Using TCGA HCC dataset, and detecting HCC tissue specimens and cell lines, we found that SOCS3 expression in HCC was inversely related to that of EZH2, and depended on its promoter methylation status. CTCF, vigilin, EZH2 and H3K27me3 were enriched at CTCF and EZH2 binding sites on the methylated SOCS3 gene promoter. The depletion of CTCF did not affect expression of EZH2 and DNMT1, but decrease recruitment of CTCF, vigilin, EZH2 and H3K27me3. Further, knockdown of CTCF led to a loss of methylation of the methylated SOCS3 promoter, which sequentially increased the expression of SOCS3 and decreased the expression of pSTAT3, the downstream effector. These findings suggest that the CTCF dependent recruitment of EZH2 to the SOCS3 gene promoter is likely to participate in the epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 and in regulating its gene expression.

Abstract: Chemical and physical stress, weathering, organic and inorganic matter deposition, and microbial growth over time, or “aging”, affect the optical-radiative performance of building envelope materials. Natural exposure helps to quantify these effects, but it usually requires several years. Further, the contribution of the different degradation agents cannot be isolated, and results from different campaigns cannot be easily compared because of the variability in the boundary conditions producing aging. Here we present an adaptation of the protocol implemented by ASTM as D7897-18 “Standard Practice for Laboratory Soiling and Weathering of Roofing Materials to Simulate Effects of Natural Exposure on Solar Reflectance and Thermal Emittance”. The aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the changes in albedo (solar reflectance) and thermal emittance experienced by building envelope materials in European urban areas rather than in the United States. We tuned the spraying duration and weathering cycles, and we compared the UV–vis–NIR reflectances of naturally-aged specimens (48 months in Rome and Milan) of roofing and wall finish materials to those exposed to laboratory weathering and soiling. Excluding those materials that show early physical-chemical degradation, the mean absolute deviation between natural and laboratory exposure of roofing products is equal to 0.027 in albedo. This is a lower value than the differences between two natural exposure campaigns at the same site. We clearly defined the limits of application of the protocol, providing an appraisal of the repeatability of natural aging. Moreover, we identified possible improvements in the methodology to conduct both natural and laboratory exposure.

Abstract: In this report, a modeling approach is employed to study the effect of the grain boundaries (GBs) and their electronic activity on the performance parameters of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our model is based on the 1- dimensional drift-diffusion framework to engage the electron (hole) defects formed in the GBs and the GB's location through the perovskite layer. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC is optimized with regards to the perovskite layer thickness, GBs location and perovskite layer band offset with GBs layer. The results shows that the location or the distribution of the GBs can vary the PCE of PSCs from 12% to around 21%, thereby making proper morphology engineering and passivation of GBs is a chief requirement for achieving high efficiency. PCEs larger than 21% require GB defect densities below 1015cm−2. It is demonstrated that the band offset of about 100 meV with GB width of 1 nm could effectively suppress the negative impact of the GBs throughout the entire perovskite layer. Interestingly, GBs location at closer points to electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface may give rise to higher PCEs, however, relatively stronger hysteresis in current values is observed. The results here provide insight into the effect of the GBs location and their corresponding type of defects on the hysteresis and the PSC performance and opens up new horizons to find solutions for current PSC's shortcomings.

Abstract: Renewable energy has become of great interest over the past years in order to mitigate Global Warming. One of the actions gaining attention is the enhancement of the thermal energy storage capacity of Concentrated Solar Power plants. The addition of nanoencapsulated phase change materials (core-shell nanoparticles) to the already used materials has been proposed for that purpose, due to the possibility of increasing thermal storage through the contribution of both core latent heat and sensible heat. In this work, Atomic Layer Deposition has been used to synthesise SiO2 and Al2O3 nanoscale coatings on tin nanoparticles. The multi-encapsulated phase change materials have been characterised in terms of chemical composition, crystalline structure, particle size, thermal stability and thermal storage capacity. Sn@Al2O3 nanoparticles present the best thermal behaviour as they show the lowest reduction in the phase change enthalpy over 100 cycles due to the oxidation barrier of the coating. Moreover, the specific heat of both nanoparticles and solar salt-based nanofluids is increased, making the nanoencapsulated phase change material suitable for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: This paper describes the influence of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) deposition temperature on heavily doped silicon based (doped-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts for silicon solar cells. The doped-Si films are obtained by PECVD intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) and a subsequent thermal POCl3 diffusion process. By changing the deposition temperature of PECVD, a-Si films with different degrees of crystallinity and density can be obtained. These differences between the a-Si films result in different properties of the passivating contacts in terms of passivation quality and carrier selectivity. By exploring a range of PECVD deposition temperatures from 250 °C to 470 °C, the best passivation quality is obtained at a temperature of 420 °C. On the other hand, the contact resistivity decreases with increasing deposition temperature. After studying the a-Si properties and the resulting passivating contact properties, we obtain optimal passivating contacts with a high implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 742 mV and a low contact resistivity ρc of 6.4 mΩ∙cm2.

Abstract: The incorporation of phase change material (PCM) into the building integrated semi-transparent photovoltaic (BISTPV) system is a promising technology to regulate the enhanced surface temperature of the photovoltaic (PV) system. In this work, Sodium Sulfate Decahydrate (Na2SO4·10H2O) and Zinc Nitrate Hexahydrate (N2O6Zn·6H2O) were mixed to form the binary eutectic PCM by heating mixing method. The results of Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) characterization of those eutectic mixtures showed that the molar mass proportion of 70% weight of Na2SO4·10H2O and 30% weight N2O6Zn·6H2O was an optimum eutectic mixture for the solar energy applications. The developed eutectic mixture was employed in the specially designed and fabricated building-integrated semi-transparent photovoltaic phase change material (BISTPV-PCM) system to regulate BISTPV cell temperature. The experimentation was carried out at the outdoor environmental conditions in the region of Kovilpatti (9°10′0″N, 77°52′0″E), Tamilnadu, India throughout the year of 2018. The instantaneous peak temperature was reduced up to 12 ᵒC for the BISTPV-PCM system compared to the non-PCM counterpart. The annual output power generated from the BISTPV module was 34,287 W h/year which increased to 37,024 W h/year by using PCM.

Abstract: Soiling of solar cover glass can cause a significant loss of electrical output from PV panels. Dew condensed on the surface exacerbates soiling rates and promotes reactions between dust and glass leading to stronger adhesive forces that make cleaning more expensive. To reduce soiling rates and lower cleaning costs, anti-soiling coatings are being developed. Although the interactions between dust particles and uncoated low-iron glass surfaces are known, the mechanisms by which anti-soiling coatings reduce soiling rates are less well understood. In this paper we report on the effect of wetting properties on both the soiling rate as well as the cleaning efficiency of polymer coated solar cover glass substrates in the presence of condensed water in a controlled environment. Coatings were fabricated with water contact angles (CAs) ranging from 149° to 51° and compared to bare glass. Arizona Test Dust was applied onto substrates on which water condensate (i.e. artificial dew) had formed. The surfaces were baked to enable cementation to occur. Such dew-dust-dry cycles were repeated to simulate naturally occurring, cumulative soiling processes. Changes in dust accumulation rates were assessed as a function of coating properties. Hydrophobic coated glass exhibited 42% lower soiling rates compared to hydrophilic glass. A dust “herding” mechanism was identified to account for these reduced soiling rates, by which dust is concentrated into discrete piles during the lateral shrinkage of droplets on low-energy surfaces. These hydrophobic surfaces were also easier to clean with >99% of the original direct transmittance restored using only water.

Abstract: VO2 thermochromic coatings show great potential as the main component in smart radiator devices (SRD) for spacecraft, most notably for micro- and nano-satellites. Indeed, the inherent metal to insulator transition (MIT) of VO2 allows such a coating to act as a lightweight thermal regulator, eliminating the need for heavy and failure-prone mechanical louvers. However, spacecraft industry standards require an emissivity variation Δε of at least 60%, a value which, to our knowledge, has yet to be demonstrated. To reach and surpass this value, we first apply a modeling approach to optimize the optical properties and thicknesses of the individual constituent films of a typical SRD with the following architecture: mirror | dielectric resonant cavity | VO2. This study then highlights various possible avenues to enhance the performance of the devices, one of these being the use of an infrared transparent ultralow refractive index dielectric material for the resonant cavity. This theoretical prediction is then confirmed by the deposition of various prototype devices implementing a CaF2 cavity layer with n @ 10 μm = 1.17 and with measured values of Δε in excess of 60% for the full 3 to 25 μm wavelength range. In fact, we demonstrate a prototype device with a maximum Δε value of 66%, thus bringing this technology one step closer to implementation.

Abstract: Impact of halogen content in FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I1-xBrx)3 absorbing layers of the perovskite solar cells (PSC) was investigated through numerical simulation, where the halogen content which is the Br/(Br + I) compositional ratio affects their bandgap (Eg). In this contribution, the Eg was varied from 1.48 to 1.70 eV for the different Eg grading through the variation of the Br/(Br + I) compositional ratio from 0 to 0.25, respectively. The Eg grading is defined as (Eg at front - Eg at back)/perovskite thickness. The Eg values at front and back are the Eg values of the perovskite absorber at light incident side and back side, respectively. It is demonstrated that the open-circuit voltage is significantly increased under the positive Eg grading because of the enhancement of the carrier separation. On the other hand, the short-circuit current density is enhanced under both negative and positive Eg grading owing to the improved efficient use of the broader solar spectrum. Ultimately, the highest power conversion efficiency of the PSC is demonstrated when the positive Eg grading consists of the Eg of 1.61 eV at front (Br/(Br + I) of 0.15) and the Eg of 1.48 eV at back (Br/(Br + I) of 0.00). Moreover, the effect of the carrier diffusion length is discussed.

Abstract: Plasmonic nanofluids are recently explored to promote steam generation, showing great promise of such fluids for solar thermal applications. However, plasmonic nanoparticles are opaque and the nanofluids require high mass concentration to achieve efficient evaporation, which in turn leads to parasitic light absorption for the underlying particles. In this work, we introduce bubbles into dilute plasmonic nanofluids to enhance solar water evaporation. The dynamic bubbles not only act as light scattering centers to extend the incident light pathway and amplify solar flux, but also provide large gas-liquid interfaces for moisture capture as well as kinetic energy from bubble bursting to improve vapor diffusion. The coupling effect between plasmonic heating and bubbly-flow humidification results in a steam generation rate of 0.72 kg m−2 h−1 under two-sun, which is about three-time higher than that of the pure water. A series of experiments under different light intensities, concentration of nanofluids, gas flow rates as well as photothermal materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles are also conducted to verify the concept. It is concluded that all the nanofluids enhance the steam generation process, and the bubbly flow nanofluids can be further improved the performance. This work provides an original insight on the bubbly flow nanofluids for solar vapor generation, and stands for a basis to design scalable solar evaporators from accessible raw materials.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have been appearing as a superior photovoltaic device owing to their high photovoltaic performance and low cost of fabrication. The formation of a compact and uniform perovskite layer with large crystal size is a significant factor to get the best device performance. In this work, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) was used as a ferroelectric polymer additive to fabricate high-performance mesoporous CH3NH3PbI3-xClx mixed-halide perovskite solar cells in a sequential deposition method. Power conversion efficiency has been enhanced from 10.4 to 16.51% in an ambient atmosphere in the presence of an optimized amount of PVDF assuring continuous and smooth layers with large grain size. Besides morphological improvements, this progress in the photovoltaic performance is attributed to the dipole field exerted by PVDF that leads to enhanced charge separation. Further improvements in efficiency (18.60%) have been achieved by directing the dipoles under an external field.

Abstract: A comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to that of commercial Si solar cells (over 23%) has been achieved by organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (OIH-PSCs) within several years. As OIH-PSC materials have hygroscopic organic cations that limit their thermal and long-term stability (i.e. operational lifetime of about 1 year, much shorter than commercial Si of 20–25 years), significant research efforts have been directed to the development of all-inorganic PSCs to overcome this limitation. These studies have demonstrated that cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) and Pb-free cesium tin halide (CsSnX3) perovskites are promising materials for the fabrication of thermally stable and efficient solar cells. This work reviews recent progress on versatile CsPbX3 and CsSnX3 inorganic PSCs. Remarkable PCE values over 17% and 4% have been achieved by employing CsPbX3 and CsSnX3 perovskites, respectively, in a short development time. In addition, we evaluate the materials engineering methods and film deposition techniques for producing such inorganic perovskite materials. Several strategies including surface and interfacial passivation are discussed to alleviate hysteresis and instability of inorganic PSCs. Furthermore, future research directions including device engineering using inorganic metal oxide charge transport layers are suggested to further reinforce this innovative advances in the inorganic PSCs.

Abstract: Numerous studies have reported that lncRNAs could play a significant role in carcinogenesis. PART1, as an identified lncRNA, was an oncogene in several cancers. However, the underling mechanism of PART1 regulating colorectal cancer remains unknown. qRT-PCR was used to measure relevant RNAs expression. CCK8 and colony formation were combined to evaluate cell proliferation. Tunel and flow cytometry were performed to access cell apoptosis. Wound healing and Transwell assay testified cell invasion and migration ability. Relevant protein expression level was measured via Western blot assay. TOP/FOP luciferase assay determined the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. According to experiment findings, PART1 was up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Inhibition of PART1 hindered CRC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while promoting CRC cell apoptosis. Experiments in vivo also validated this result. Mechanistically, PART1 sponged miR-150-5p/miR-520 h to up-regulate CTNNB1, thus activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC. In summary, PART1 could up-regulate CTNNB1 via sponging miR-150-5p/miR-520 h.

Abstract: Vitamin D3 is among the major neurosteroids whose role in developing and adult brain is intensively studied now. Its active form 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the expression and functioning of a range of brain-specific proteins, which orchestrate the neurotransmitter turnover, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Despite numerous studies of the vitamin D role in normal and pathological brain function, there is little evidence on the mechanisms of alterations in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission under vitamin D deficiency (VDD). Using the animal model we characterized the dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission under alimentary VDD. The shift between unstimulated and evoked GABA release under VDD was largely reversed after treatment of VDD, whereas the impairments in glutamatergic system were only partially recovered after 1-month vitamin D3 supplementation. The increase of the external glutamate level and unstimulated GABA release in brain nerve terminals was associated with intensified ROS production and higher [Ca2+]i in presynapse. The negative allosteric modulation of presynaptic mGlu7 receptors significantly enhanced exocytotic GABA release, which was decreased under VDD, thereby suggesting the neuroprotective effect of such modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission. Synaptic plasma membranes and cytosolic proteins contribute to the decreased stimulated release of neurotransmitter, by being the crucial components, whose functional state is impaired under VDD. The critical changes with synaptic vesicles occurred at the docking step of the process, whereas malfunctioning of synaptic cytosolic proteins impacted the fusion event foremost. The decreased amplitude of exocytosis was inherent for non-excitable cells as well, as evidenced by lower platelet degranulation. Our data suggest the presynaptic dysfunction and proinflammatory shift as the early events in the pathogenesis of VDD-associated disorders and provide evidences for the neuroprotective role of vitamin D3.

Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase 2 (ENPP2) plays a crucial role in myogenic differentiation through the regulation by WNT/β-Catenin signaling,

Abstract: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase type II (ENPP2), also known as Autotaxin (ATX), is an enzyme present in blood circulation that converts lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). While LPA has been demonstrated to play diverse roles in skeletal myogenesis, mainly through in vitro studies, the role of ENPP2 in skeletal myogenesis has not been determined. We previously found that Enpp2 is induced by a positive WNT/β-Catenin signaling regulator, R-spondin2 (RSPO2), in C2C12 myoblast cells. As RSPO2 promotes myogenic differentiation via the WNT/β-Catenin signaling pathway, we hypothesized that ENPP2 may act as a key mediator for the crosstalk between WNT and LPA signaling during myogenic differentiation. Herein, we found that ENPP2 function is essential for myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. Pharmacological ENPP2 inhibitors or RNAi-mediated Enpp2 gene knockdown severely impaired the myogenic differentiation, including the cell fusion process, whereas administration of the recombinant ENPP2 protein enhanced myogenic differentiation. Consistent with the in vitro results, mice lacking the Enpp2 gene showed a disrupted muscle regeneration after acute muscle injury. The size of newly regenerated myofibers in Enpp2 mutant muscle was significantly reduced compared with wild-type regenerated muscle. Modified expression patterns of myogenic markers in Enpp2 mutant muscle further emphasized the impaired muscle regeneration process. Finally, we convincingly demonstrate that the Enpp2 gene is a direct transcriptional target for WNT/β-Catenin signaling. Functional TCF/LEF1 binding sites within the upstream region of Enpp2 gene were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-β-Catenin antibodies and reporter assay. Our study reveals that ENPP2 is regulated by WNT/β-Catenin signaling and plays a key positive role in myogenic differentiation.

Abstract: We report on the inclusion of 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AVA)—a bulky, long-chained organic molecule—as an additive to enhance the mechanical integrity of hybrid perovskite films. We studied a range of organic cation additives and found that 5-AVA was the most effective at improving cohesion energy, a key metric of mechanical reliability. MAPbI3 films reinforced with 5-AVA added in 5% concentration increased cohesion energy 12-fold from 0.53 J/m2 to 6.04 J/m2, an effect which is attributed to increased plasticity and crack deflection around grain boundaries of the additive-containing perovskite. The addition of 5-AVA also improves Voc in perovskite solar cells and carrier lifetimes with a minimal decrease in PCE, attributed to passivation reducing defect and trap densities. A Tauc plot analysis of the bandgap shows that 5-AVA increases the band gap of the perovskite, correlating with reduced film stress compared to MAPbI3. As a result, the usage of 5-AVA improves the intrinsic thermomechanical reliability, but this improvement comes at the penalty of slightly reduced device efficiency due to reduced charge extraction from the presence of the bulky, insulating organic additive.

Abstract: Downscaling the front-side texture from the micron-scale to the nanoscale introduces new possibilities for light management in solar cells and is considered as an opportunity for further reducing g/Wp without compromising on power conversion efficiency. We report on the fabrication and characterisation of periodic inverse nanopyramid textured silicon heterojunction devices on a range of substrate thicknesses for identifying the constraints that could limit the performance of nanostructured cells. The devices are benchmarked against the industry standard random pyramid texture. While the open-circuit voltage is comparable and demonstrates that effective surface passivation can be achieved with inverse nanopyramid textured devices, the device efficiencies are hampered by considerable reflection losses in the 400–800 nm wavelength range. We deduce that these reflection losses arise due to constraints that can be both processing-related or intrinsic to the nanotexture and amount to a short-circuit current density (JSC) loss of 2.2 mA/cm2 on 125 μm thick substrates. Experimental constraints include the imperfect nanopatterning on rough surfaces, the non-conformal deposition of sputtered ITO antireflection coating (ARC) on nanopyramids and the non-ideal area filling fraction of the pattern. The intrinsic limitation comes from the diffraction effect of periodic nanopyramids, whose pitch determines the targeted wavelength for reflectance minima. Moreover, parasitic absorption in ARC significantly lowers the JSC of our cells for both texturing schemes. Therefore, despite being able to effectively passivate, the identified processing-related constraints regarding nanotextured cells will need to be overcome for attaining performance that is equivalent with the random pyramid textured cells.

Abstract: This article describes the design of a silver electrodeposition-based electrochromic (EC) device with excellent image retention properties by using the counter electrode reaction of Prussian blue (PB). We demonstrated silver electrodeposition-based EC device enabled various optical states without dyes and pigments. These optical states were explained by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of silver nanoparticles electrodeposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. However, the color retention property of the device was inadequate because of the presence of Cu2+ ions, which function as redox reaction materials at the counter electrode. That is, Cu2+ in the electrolyte oxidizes the silver deposits on the electrode, resulting in a lack of image retention property. To improve both the redox reactivity of the counter electrode and color retention property, here we utilized PB as the counter electrode material. We discuss the device properties of the silver electrodeposition-based EC device with the PB counter electrode in terms of charge density or its ability to change color. The device achieved both longer retention time in the colored state and reversibility. It has an advantage of maintaining the coloring state without electric power for practical applications.

Abstract: The concept and design of a photovoltaic system for harvesting salt and electricity at salt farm floor were proposed for the first time. Various concepts and designs were explored from the point of view of waterproofing, salt resistance, material and electrical safety, maintenance, and economic feasibility. Even though the concept and design are still evolving through field tests, the first-generation design of a photovoltaic system applied on the salt farm floor is unveiled. The power generation of the salt-farm parallel system is comparable to that of conventional solar power plants. The cooling effect by seawater contributes more to the increase in the crystalline silicon photovoltaic module performance than does the absorption loss due to seawater by maintaining a certain height above the module.

Abstract: Design and fabrication of antireflection coatings (ARCs) was performed to maximize the photocurrent of Ⅲ-Ⅴ solar cells based on InGaP, GaAs, InGaAsP, and InGaAs. The current-limiting behavior of multi-junction solar cells allowed only the specific design of ARCs to improve the total current density of multi-junction solar cells, which enabled thin and efficient antireflection layers to achieve their full potential. ARCs were designed for InGaP/GaAs and InGaAsP/InGaAs double junction solar cells and InGaP/GaAs/InGaAsP/InGaAs quadruple junction solar cells. From the ARC design results, the best solar cell reflectance at the region of interest appeared to be 1.44% for InGaP/GaAs solar cells, 2.17% for InGaAsP/InGaAs, and 0.48% for the quadruple junction solar cells. To achieve the preferred refractive index for the ARC structures, nanostructures fabricated via glancing angle deposition were utilized. With ARC fabricated structures, InGaP/GaAs double junction solar cells yielded a power conversion efficiency of 13.3%, which was 1.34 times higher than that of cells without ARC (9.91%). Additionally, calculation results for the various ARC designs using dual and triple material systems were provided to increase their applicability.

Abstract: SALL4 and OCT4, along with other pluripotency-associated transcription factors, play critical roles in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal. Ku80 is a component of the protein complex called DNA-dependent protein kinase, which mainly involved in DNA double-strand break repair. In this study, we show evidence that Ku80 physically interacted with SALL4. The interaction competitively disrupts the SALL4-OCT4 complex and result in OCT4 lysosomal degradation. Finally, Ku80 inhibits self-renewal and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through breaking the SALL4-OCT4 interactions and down-regulating the expression of OCT4. Our study reveal novel function of Ku80 in stemness maintaining of cancer stem cells via its interaction with SALL4 and highlight the double-sidedness of Ku80 as an anti-cancer target.

Abstract: Nanostructured NiO as hole selective contact for perovskite solar cells is deposited on ITO from the potentiostatic anodic electrodeposition of NiOOH. Along with the large surface extension due to the honeycomb-like morphology, the electrodeposition route imparts different electrochemical features in respect to the classic sol-gel derived NiO, which are two interesting features for optoelectronic applications. CH3NH3PbI3 is deposited in ambient atmosphere on the NiO substrates to fabricate p-i-n perovskite solar cells, with PCBM and solution processed BCP as electron selective contact and silver as counter electrode. We found that the performances are strongly dependent on the deposition potential, with the PCE increasing when going from 1.00 V to 1.10 V vs Ag/AgCl. The best efficiency obtained is 16.1%, thanks to a fill-factor of 78%. Notably, the electrodeposited layer outperformed the sol-gel spin-coated one, proving the effectiveness of electrosynthesis to achieve competitive selective contacts for perovskite photovoltaics.

Abstract: To offset the negative impact of photovoltaic modules on the environment, it is necessary to introduce a long-term strategy that includes a complete lifecycle assessment of all system components from the production phase through installation and operation to disposal. Recycling of waste products and worn-out systems is an important element of this strategy. As the conclusions from the previous studies have shown, thermal treatment provides an efficient first step in the recycling process, while chemical treatment was more advantageous in the second step. This study aims to assess the environmental impact of recovering and recycling the valuable semiconductor silicon wafer material from photovoltaic solar cells. A comparison was made between producing new solar cells with or without recycled silicon material. The analysis of the photovoltaic cell life cycle scenario including material recycling presented in this article was performed using SimaPro software and data combined and extended from different LCI databases. The idea is that the use of recycled materials, which were energy-consuming in the primary production stage, allows to meaningly reduce the energy input in the secondary life cycle. All stages of the silicon cell life cycle contribute to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through the use of recycled silicon material represented 42%. The total environmental impact of photovoltaic production can be reduced by as much as 58%, mainly through reduced energy consumption in the production process of high purity crystalline silicon.

Abstract: A series of composite phase change materials (cPCMs) are fabricated through the one-pot method with the epoxidized methoxy polyethylene glycol (EmPEG) as the thermal energy unit and polydopamine-reduced graphene oxide (PDA-rGO) nanosheets as the interfacial enhancement. Structure and thermal properties such as phase change enthalpy, thermal repeatability, and light-to-thermal conversion capacity of EmPEG/PDA-rGO cPCMs with PDA-rGO content varying from 0.5 to 4 wt% have been detailed discussed. A superior stabilization performance of EmPEG/PDA-rGO cPCMs to pristine EmPEG is demonstrated based on the interfacial action from the incorporated PDA-rGO nanosheets. EmPEG/PDA-rGO-3 presents good structure-stabilized behavior after 100 heating-cooling cycles, and no liquid leakage appears up to 105 °C. In the meantime, EmPEG/PDA-rGO-3 illustrates a stable thermal reliability and thermal charging/discharging rate, and the light-to-thermal conversion efficiency reaches 96% under the 100 mW/cm2 irradiation. Thus, the structure-stabilized EmPEG/PDA-rGO cPCMs tuned by the interfacial interaction demonstrates the promising application in the field of the thermal energy storage and solar energy conversion.

Abstract: The development of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) programs can face significant challenges in most developing countries because such endeavors must compete with other government health care priorities, including the delivery of basic services. While this is may be a limiting factor, these countries should prioritize development of the needed expertise to offer state of the art treatments including transplantation, by providing financial, technological, legal, ethical and other needed support. This would prove beneficial in providing successful programs customized to the needs of their population, and potentially provide long-term cost-savings by circumventing the need for their citizens to seek care abroad. Costs of establishing HSCT program and the costs of the HSCT procedure itself can be substantial barriers in developing countries. Additionally, socioeconomic factors intrinsic to specific countries can influence access to HSCT, patient eligibility for HSCT and timely utilization of HSCT center capabilities. This report describes recommendations from the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (WBMT) for establishing HSCT programs with a specific focus on developing countries, and identifies challenges and opportunities for providing this specialized procedure in the resource constrained setting.

Abstract: Inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite has emerged as a promising material for fabricating highly stable perovskite solar cell devices. However, during the formation of thermally evaporated CsPbBr3 film, an all-solid reaction between CsBr and PbBr2 leads to non-uniform interfaces and high defect density in the perovskite film. In this work, we utilize a two-step sintering (TSS) method which successfully modifies the morphologies of thermally evaporated CsPbBr3 films and the power conversion efficiency of a champion CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell achieves 9.35%. Steady-state photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence and space-charge-limited-current results prove that the TSS process can effectively reduce defect densities also. Besides these improvements, the TSS device maintains 94% of initial efficiency after being heated at 100 °C without encapsulation for over 40 days under ambient lab condition. In comparison, the untreated device reduces about 15%. Transmission electron microscope results further prove the reduction of line defects in CsPbBr3 crystals after TSS treatment.

Abstract: Concentrating solar power (CSP) has potential to increase the amount of renewable energy on electric grids and reduce global carbon emissions, in particular because of its capability to incorporate inexpensive thermal energy storage. To realize this potential, development of latent heat storage with phase change materials (PCMs) is attractive because of its high energy density and low material cost. Research in this area has identified many promising materials, and has developed effective storage system designs that could be used to deploy PCMs. However, the field has lacked a rigorous methodology to select the optimal material for a particular CSP system. To address this need, here we present a holistic model that evaluates all important influences of PCM properties on the performance and cost of an entire CSP plant. We apply this model to over 100 of the most widely considered candidate materials, including both salts and metals. We quantify the relative value of each PCM property, and identify leading materials for application in CSP systems. This method and our results may aid future efforts to develop latent heat storage by providing a more informed view of how material selection impacts an entire CSP system.
