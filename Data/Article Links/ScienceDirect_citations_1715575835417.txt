Abstract: Summary
Many therapeutic antibodies deplete target cells and elicit immunotherapy by engaging activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) on host effector cells. These antibodies are negatively regulated by the inhibitory FcγRIIB (CD32B). Dogma suggests inhibition is mediated through the FcγRIIB immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), negatively regulating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling from activating FcγR. To assess this, we generated experimental models expressing human (h)FcγRIIB on targets or effectors, lacking or retaining ITIM signaling capacity. We demonstrate that signaling through the hFcγRIIB ITIM is dispensable for impairing monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated depletion of normal and malignant murine target cells through three therapeutically relevant surface receptors (CD20, CD25, and OX40) affecting immunotherapy. We demonstrate that hFcγRIIB competition with activating FcγRs for antibody Fc, rather than ITIM signaling, is sufficient to impair activating FcγR engagement, inhibiting effector function and immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In the Bruce effect, a mated female mouse becomes resistant to the pregnancy-blocking effect of the stud. Various lines of evidence suggest that this form of behavioral imprinting results from reduced sensitivity of the female’s accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) to the stud’s chemosignals. However, the AOB’s combinatorial code implies that diminishing responses to one individual will distort representations of other stimuli. Here, we record extracellular responses of AOB neurons in mated and unmated female mice while presenting urine stimuli from the stud and from other sources. We find that, while initial sensory responses in the AOB (within a timescale required to guide social interactions) remain stable, responses to extended stimulation (as required for eliciting the pregnancy block) display selective attenuation of stud-responsive neurons. Such temporal disassociation could allow attenuation of slow-acting endocrine processes in a stimulus-specific manner without compromising ongoing representations that guide behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Sarcopenia and frailty are urgent socio-economic problems worldwide. Here we demonstrate a functional connection between the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and skeletal muscle through Slc12a8, a recently identified nicotinamide mononucleotide transporter, and its relationship to sarcopenia and frailty. Slc12a8-expressing cells are mainly localized in the LH. LH-specific knockdown of Slc12a8 in young mice decreases activity-dependent energy and carbohydrate expenditure and skeletal muscle functions, including muscle mass, muscle force, intramuscular glycolysis, and protein synthesis. LH-specific Slc12a8 knockdown also decreases sympathetic nerve signals at neuromuscular junctions and β2-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle, indicating the importance of the LH-sympathetic nerve-β2-adrenergic receptor axis. LH-specific overexpression of Slc12a8 in aged mice significantly ameliorates age-associated decreases in energy expenditure and skeletal muscle functions. Our results highlight an important role of Slc12a8 in the LH for regulation of whole-body metabolism and skeletal muscle functions and provide insights into the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and frailty during aging.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) represents a major challenge for anticancer therapies. An integrated, multidimensional, multiregional approach dissecting ITH of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor microenvironment (TME) is employed at the single-cell level with mass cytometry (CyTOF), multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and at the bulk level with whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA-seq, and methylation profiling. Multiregional analyses reveal unexpected conservation of immune composition within each individual patient, with profound differences among patients, presenting patient-specific tumor immune microenvironment signatures despite underlying genetic heterogeneity from clonal evolution. Spatial proteogenomic TME analysis using MxIF identifies 14 distinct cellular neighborhoods and, conversely, demonstrated architectural heterogeneity among different tumor regions. Tumor-expressed cytokines are identified as key determinants of the TME and correlate with clinical outcome. Overall, this work signifies that spatial ITH occurs in ccRCC, which may drive clinical heterogeneity and warrants further interrogation to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying the chemical regulators of biological pathways is a time-consuming bottleneck in developing therapeutics and research compounds. Typically, thousands to millions of candidate small molecules are tested in target-based biochemical screens or phenotypic cell-based screens, both expensive experiments customized to each disease. Here, our uncustomized, virtual, profile-based screening approach instead identifies compounds that match to pathways based on the phenotypic information in public cell image data, created using the Cell Painting assay. Our straightforward correlation-based computational strategy retrospectively uncovered the expected, known small-molecule regulators for 32% of positive-control gene queries. In prospective, discovery mode, we efficiently identified new compounds related to three query genes and validated them in subsequent gene-relevant assays, including compounds that phenocopy or pheno-oppose YAP1 overexpression and kill a Yap1-dependent sarcoma cell line. This image-profile-based approach could replace many customized labor- and resource-intensive screens and accelerate the discovery of biologically and therapeutically useful compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Rifamycin antibiotics such as rifampin are potent inhibitors of prokaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) used to treat tuberculosis and other bacterial infections. Although resistance arises in the clinic principally through mutations in RNAP, many bacteria possess highly specific enzyme-mediated resistance mechanisms that modify and inactivate rifamycins. The expression of these enzymes is controlled by a 19-bp cis-acting rifamycin-associated element (RAE). Guided by the presence of RAE sequences, we identify a helicase-like protein, HelR, in Streptomyces venezuelae that confers broad-spectrum rifamycin resistance. We show that HelR also promotes tolerance to rifamycins, enabling bacterial evasion of the toxic properties of these antibiotics. HelR forms a complex with RNAP and rescues transcription inhibition by displacing rifamycins from RNAP, thereby providing resistance by target protection . Furthermore, HelRs are broadly distributed in Actinobacteria, including several opportunistic Mycobacterial pathogens, offering yet another challenge for developing new rifamycin antibiotics.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that plays a critical role in regulating antiviral signaling. cGAS binds to DNA and catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which is essential for downstream signal transduction. The antiviral response is a rapid biological process; however, cGAS itself has relatively low DNA binding affinity, implying that formation of the cGAS-DNA complex requires an additional factor(s) that promotes cGAS-DNA binding, allowing efficient antiviral signal transduction. Here, we report that the Ku proteins (Ku80 and Ku70) directly interact with cGAS and positively regulate cGAS-mediated antiviral signaling. Mechanistically, we find that the interaction of the Ku proteins with cGAS significantly increases the DNA-binding affinity of cGAS and promotes cGAS condensation in the cytosol, thereby enhancing cGAS catalytic activity. Our results show that the Ku proteins are critical partners of cGAS in sensing DNA virus infection and ensuring efficient innate immune signal transduction.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts by acquiring new contractile function. This is important for tissue repair, but it also contributes to organ fibrosis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes tissue repair and fibrosis, but the relationship between PDGF and myofibroblasts is unclear. Using mice with lineage tracing linked to PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα) gene mutations, we examine cell fates during skin wound healing. Elevated PDGFRα signaling increases proliferation but unexpectedly delays the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, suggesting that PDGFRα must be downregulated for myofibroblast differentiation. In contrast, deletion of PDGFRα decreases proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation by reducing serum response factor (SRF) nuclear localization. Consequences of SRF deletion resemble PDGFRα deletion, but deletion of two SRF coactivators, MRTFA and MRTFB, specifically eliminates myofibroblasts. Our findings suggest a scenario where PDGFRα signaling initially supports proliferation of fibroblast progenitors to expand their number during early wound healing but, later, PDGFRα downregulation facilitates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts.

Abstract: Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a malignant tumor, which is an important cause of death in all tumor deaths. The role of MARCH1 in GC has not been studied, this study aims to investigate the function of MARCH1 in GC. The expression of MARCH1 in normal tissue and tumor tissue was analyzed by TCGA-based GEPIA platform and UALCAL website and verified by RT-qPCR, Western blotting (WB), and Immunohistochemistry (IHC); CCK8 assay and crystal violet assay were separately used to detect cell viability and cell cloning ability. Cell spheroidization assay and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were performed to determine CD44+, CD133+ cell numbers to study the stemness characteristics of GC cells. While, WB was used to study the specific signaling pathway regulated by MARCH1. Animal model of GC was established to study the regulation of MARCH1 on GC growth in vivo. It showed that the expression of MARCH1 in GC tissues was higher than that in normal tissues; CCK8 and crystal violet assay showed that MARCH1 could promote cell viability and cloning ability of GC cells; cell spheroidization experiments and FACS showed that MARCH1 promoted the cloning ability of GC cells; WB results revealed that MARCH1 mainly regulated GC through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; In-vivo results showed that MARCH1 can promote the growth of GC. This study found that MARCH1 maintained the stemness characteristics and promoted the proliferation of GC cells by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: We evaluated the influence of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 pathways on BeWo, JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells, as well as in human villous explants infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Cells and explants were stimulated with LPS for 24 or 48 h and processed for the MTT assay, and expression of TLR4 was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In addition, we used peptides that inhibit MyD88 or TRIF, and inhibitor to NF-κB. Finally, the parasite proliferation was verified, and ELISA was performed to verify the cytokine production. As results, LPS did not induce toxicity in cells and explants. However, LPS triggered a reduction in T. gondii proliferation only in BeWo cells and explants. Additionally, LPS downmodulated IL-10, TGF-β1 and TNF, but upregulated IFN-γ in BeWo cells. For explants, LPS induced high levels of IL-10, TGF-β1 and IFN-γ. Finally, it was observed that the inhibition of TRIF and NF-κB increased parasitism and modulated TGF-β1 in BeWo cells, while the inhibition of MyD88 and NF-κB increased T. gondii infection and modulated IFN-γ in explants. It can be concluded that the TLR4 pathway is important for the control of T. gondii replication in BeWo cells and villous explants, in a dependent-manner of TRIF, MyD88, NF-κB and cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive hepatic glucose production contributes to the development of hyperglycemia and is a key feature of type 2 diabetes. Here, we report that activation of hepatocyte Rap1a suppresses gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production, whereas Rap1a silencing stimulates them. Rap1a activation is suppressed in obese mouse liver, and restoring its activity improves glucose intolerance. As Rap1a′s membrane localization and activation depends on its geranylgeranylation, which is inhibited by statins, we show that statin-treated hepatocytes and the human liver have lower active-Rap1a levels. Similar to Rap1a inhibition, statins stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis and increase fasting blood glucose in obese mice. Geranylgeraniol treatment, which acts as the precursor for geranylgeranyl isoprenoids, restores Rap1a activity and improves statin-mediated glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, Rap1a activation induces actin polymerization, which suppresses gluconeogenesis by Akt-mediated FoxO1 inhibition. Thus, Rap1a regulates hepatic glucose homeostasis, and blocking its activity, via lowering geranylgeranyl isoprenoids, contributes to statin-induced glucose intolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that is secreted by several cell types. We recently showed that Mfsd2b is an S1P transporter from hematopoietic cells that contributes approximately 50% plasma S1P. Here we report the characterization of compound deletion of Mfsd2b and Spns2, another S1P transporter active primarily in endothelial cells. Global deletion of Mfsd2b and Spns2 (global double knockout [gDKO]) results in embryonic lethality beyond embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), with severe hemorrhage accompanied by defects of tight junction proteins, indicating that Mfsd2b and Spns2 provide S1P for signaling, which is essential for blood vessel integrity. Compound postnatal deletion of Mfsd2b and Spns2 using Mx1Cre (ctDKO-Mx1Cre) results in maximal 80% reduction of plasma S1P. ctDKO-Mx1Cre mice exhibit severe susceptibility to anaphylaxis, indicating that S1P from Mfsd2b and Spns2 is indispensable for vascular homeostasis. Our results show that S1P export from Mfsd2b and Spns2 is essential for developing and mature vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes vary in terms of size, chromosome number, and genetic complexity. Their temporal organization is complex, reflecting coordination between DNA folding and function. Here, we used fused karyotypes of budding yeast to characterize the effects of chromosome length on nuclear architecture. We found that size-matched megachromosomes expand to occupy a larger fraction of the enlarged nucleus. Hi-C maps reveal changes in the three-dimensional structure corresponding to inactivated centromeres and telomeres. De-clustering of inactive centromeres results in their loss of early replication, highlighting a functional correlation between genome organization and replication timing. Repositioning of former telomere-proximal regions on chromosome arms exposed a subset of contacts between flocculin genes. Chromatin reorganization of megachromosomes during cell division remained unperturbed, and it revealed that centromere-rDNA contacts in anaphase, extending over 0.3 Mb on wild-type chromosome, cannot exceed ∼1.7 Mb. Our results highlight the relevance of engineered karyotypes to unveiling relationships between genome organization and function.

Abstract: The transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, members 6 and 7 (TRPM6 and TRPM7) are homologous membrane proteins encompassing cation channel units fused to cytosolic serine/threonine-protein kinase domains. Clinical studies and experiments with animal disease models suggested that selective inhibition of TRPM6 and TRPM7 currents might be beneficial for subjects with immune and cardiovascular disorders, tumours and other pathologies, but the suitable pharmacological toolkit remains underdeveloped. The present study identified small synthetic molecules acting specifically on the channel moieties of TRPM6 and TRPM7. Using electrophysiological analysis in conjunction with Ca2+ imaging, we show that iloperidone and ifenprodil inhibit the channel activity of recombinant TRPM6 with IC50 values of 0.73 and 3.33 µM, respectively, without an impact on the TRPM7 channel. We also found that VER155008 suppresses the TRPM7 channel with an IC50 value of 0.11 µM but does not affect TRPM6. Finally, the effects of iloperidone and VER155008 were found to be suitable for blocking native endogenous TRPM6 and TRPM7 in a collection of mouse and human cell models. Hence, the identification of iloperidone, ifenprodil, and VER155008 allows for the first time to selectively manipulate TRPM6 and TRPM7 currents.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular repertoire promoting cancer cell plasticity is not fully elucidated. Here, we propose that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), specifically the globo and ganglio series, correlate and promote the transition between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The epithelial character of ovarian cancer remains stable throughout disease progression, and spatial glycosphingolipidomics reveals elevated globosides in the tumor compartment compared with the ganglioside-rich stroma. CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mediated truncation of endogenous E-cadherin induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreases globosides. The transcriptomics analysis identifies the ganglioside-synthesizing enzyme ST8SIA1 to be consistently elevated in mesenchymal-like samples, predicting poor outcome. Subsequent deletion of ST8SIA1 induces epithelial cell features through mTORS2448 phosphorylation, whereas loss of globosides in ΔA4GALT cells, resulting in EMT, is accompanied by increased ERKY202/T204 and AKTS124. The GSL composition dynamics corroborate cancer cell plasticity, and further evidence suggests that mesenchymal cells are maintained through ganglioside-dependent, calcium-mediated mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Gestational exposure to environmental toxins and socioeconomic stressors is epidemiologically linked to neurodevelopmental disorders with strong male bias, such as autism. We model these prenatal risk factors in mice by co-exposing pregnant dams to an environmental pollutant and limited-resource stress, which robustly activates the maternal immune system. Only male offspring display long-lasting behavioral abnormalities and alterations in the activity of brain networks encoding social interactions. Cellularly, prenatal stressors diminish microglial function within the anterior cingulate cortex, a central node of the social coding network, in males during early postnatal development. Precise inhibition of microglial phagocytosis within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of wild-type (WT) mice during the same critical period mimics the impact of prenatal stressors on a male-specific behavior, indicating that environmental stressors alter neural circuit formation in males via impairing microglia function during development.

Abstract: Summary
Limb patterning by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), via either graded spatial or temporal signal integration, is a paradigm for “morphogen” function, yet how Shh instructs distinct digit identities remains controversial. Here, we bypass the Shh requirement in cell survival during outgrowth and demonstrate that a transient, early Shh pulse is both necessary and sufficient for normal mouse limb development. Shh response is only short range and is limited to the Shh-expressing zone during this time window. Shh patterns digits 1–3, anterior to this zone, by an indirect mechanism rather than direct spatial or temporal signal integration. Using a genetic relay-signaling assay, we discover that Shh also specifies digit 1/thumb (thought to be exclusively Shh independent) indirectly, and this finding implicates Shh in a unique regulatory hierarchy for digit 1 evolutionary adaptations such as opposable thumbs. This study illuminates Shh as a trigger for an indirect downstream network that becomes rapidly self-sustaining, with mechanistic relevance for limb development, regeneration, and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear how various factors functioning in the transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) cooperatively regulate pause/release and productive elongation in living cells. Using an acute protein-depletion approach, we report that SPT6 depletion results in the release of paused RNA Pol II into gene bodies through an impaired recruitment of PAF1C. Short genes demonstrate a release with increased mature transcripts, whereas long genes are released but fail to yield mature transcripts, due to a reduced processivity resulting from both SPT6 and PAF1C loss. Unexpectedly, SPT6 depletion causes an association of NELF with the elongating RNA Pol II on gene bodies, without any observed functional significance on transcriptional elongation pattern, arguing against a role for NELF in keeping RNA Pol II in the paused state. Furthermore, SPT6 depletion impairs heat-shock-induced pausing, pointing to a role for SPT6 in regulating RNA Pol II pause/release through PAF1C recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can adopt lineage-specific gene-expression programs by stepwise exposure to defined factors, resulting in the generation of functional cell types. Bulk and single-cell-based assays were employed to catalog gene expression, histone modifications, chromatin conformation, and accessibility transitions in ESC populations and individual cells acquiring a presomitic mesoderm fate and undergoing further specification toward myogenic and neurogenic lineages. These assays identified cis-regulatory regions and transcription factors presiding over gene-expression programs occurring at defined ESC transitions and revealed the presence of heterogeneous cell populations within discrete ESC developmental stages. The datasets were employed to identify previously unappreciated genomic elements directing the initial activation of Pax7 and myogenic and neurogenic gene-expression programs. This study provides a resource for the discovery of genomic and transcriptional features of pluripotent, mesoderm-induced ESCs and ESC-derived cell lineages.

Abstract: Summary
Linker histones are highly abundant chromatin-associated proteins with well-established structural roles in chromatin and as general transcriptional repressors. In addition, it has been long proposed that histone H1 exerts context-specific effects on gene expression. Here, we identify a function of histone H1 in chromatin structure and transcription using a range of genomic approaches. In the absence of histone H1, there is an increase in the transcription of non-coding RNAs, together with reduced levels of m6A modification leading to their accumulation on chromatin and causing replication-transcription conflicts. This strongly suggests that histone H1 prevents non-coding RNA transcription and regulates non-coding transcript turnover on chromatin. Accordingly, altering the m6A RNA methylation pathway rescues the replicative phenotype of H1 loss. This work unveils unexpected regulatory roles of histone H1 on non-coding RNA turnover and m6A deposition, highlighting the intimate relationship between chromatin conformation, RNA metabolism, and DNA replication to maintain genome performance.

Abstract: Hyperpolarization is associated with decreased intracellular Na+ concentration through the closure of the epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) during capacitation. 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is involved in the regulation of Na+ transport by reducing ENaC-β abundance in the plasma membrane in somatic cells. However, it is not known whether AMPK acts on ENaCs in sperm. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of AMPK activation in the regulation of ENaC and to examine its relationship with capacitation-associated hyperpolarization of human sperm. Human sperm were treated with AICAR (AMPK activator) in non-capacitating and capacitating conditions. AMPK activity and ENaC-β concentration were evaluated by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to measure tyrosine phosphorylation, hyperpolarization, intracellular Na+ concentration and acrosome reaction. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out to analyze the distribution of ENaC-β and CD46 in sperm. We found that induction of capacitation triggered AMPK phosphorylation. AMPK activation by AICAR increased tyrosine phosphorylation. AICAR decreased ENaC-β levels, mainly localized at the principal-piece of the flagellum, resulting in lower intracellular Na+ concentration and increased hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Altogether, these data provide evidence that AMPK activation is involved in capacitation-associated hyperpolarization by reducing ENaC abundance in human sperm.

Abstract: Summary
There is a continued unmet need for treatments that can slow Parkinson’s disease progression due to the lack of understanding behind the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Since its discovery, ferroptosis has been implicated in several diseases and represents a therapeutic target in Parkinson’s disease. Here, we use two highly relevant human dopaminergic neuronal models to show that endogenous levels of α-synuclein can determine the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to ferroptosis. We show that reducing α-synuclein expression in dopaminergic neurons leads to ferroptosis evasion, while elevated α-synuclein expression in patients’ small-molecule-derived neuronal precursor cells with SNCA triplication causes an increased vulnerability to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Lipid profiling reveals that ferroptosis resistance is due to a reduction in ether-linked phospholipids, required for ferroptosis, in neurons depleted of α-synuclein (α-syn). These results provide a molecular mechanism linking α-syn levels to the sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to ferroptosis, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic dysfunction mutations can impair energy sensing and cause cancer. Loss of function of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme subunit succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) results in various forms of cancer typified by pheochromocytoma (PC). Here we delineate a signaling cascade where the loss of SDHB induces the Warburg effect, triggers dysregulation of [Ca2+]i, and aberrantly activates calpain and protein kinase Cdk5, through conversion of its cofactor from p35 to p25. Consequently, aberrant Cdk5 initiates a phospho-signaling cascade where GSK3 inhibition inactivates energy sensing by AMP kinase through dephosphorylation of the AMP kinase γ subunit, PRKAG2. Overexpression of p25-GFP in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells also elicits this phosphorylation signaling and causes PC. A potent Cdk5 inhibitor, MRT3-007, reverses this phospho-cascade, invoking a senescence-like phenotype. This therapeutic approach halted tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we reveal an important mechanistic feature of metabolic sensing and demonstrate that its dysregulation underlies tumor progression in PC and likely other cancers.

Abstract: Summary
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key component of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). 5-FU efficacy is established by intracellular levels of folate cofactors and DNA damage repair strategies. However, drug resistance still represents a major challenge. Here, we report that alterations in serine metabolism affect 5-FU sensitivity in in vitro and in vivo CRC models. In particular, 5-FU-resistant CRC cells display a strong serine dependency achieved either by upregulating endogenous serine synthesis or increasing exogenous serine uptake. Importantly, regardless of the serine feeder strategy, serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2)-driven compartmentalization of one-carbon metabolism inside the mitochondria represents a specific adaptation of resistant cells to support purine biosynthesis and potentiate DNA damage response. Interfering with serine availability or affecting its mitochondrial metabolism revert 5-FU resistance. These data disclose a relevant mechanism of mitochondrial serine use supporting 5-FU resistance in CRC and provide perspectives for therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are highly efficient at inducing CD8+ T cell responses. However, LV-encoded antigens are processed inside the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells, which does not directly communicate with the endosomal major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) presentation pathway. LVs are thus poor at inducing CD4+ T cell response. To overcome this limitation, we devised a strategy whereby LV-encoded antigens are extended at their N-terminal end with the MHC-II-associated light invariant chain (li), which contains an endosome-targeting signal sequence. When evaluated with an LV-encoded polyantigen composed of CD4+ T cell targets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, intranasal vaccination in mice triggers pulmonary polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Adjuvantation of these LVs extends the mucosal immunity to Th17 and Tc17 responses. A systemic prime and an intranasal boost with one of these LV induces protection against M. tuberculosis. This strategy improves the protective power of LVs against infections and cancers, where CD4+ T cell immunity plays an important role.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinase R (PKR) is an immune response protein that becomes activated by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). PKR overactivation is associated with degenerative diseases with inflammation, including osteoarthritis (OA), but the dsRNA activator remains largely unknown. Here, we find that mitochondrial dsRNA (mt-dsRNA) expression and its cytosolic efflux are facilitated in chondrocytes under OA-eliciting conditions, leading to innate immune activation. Moreover, mt-dsRNAs are released to the extracellular space and activate Toll-like receptor 3 at the plasma membrane. Elevated levels of mt-dsRNAs in the synovial fluids and damaged cartilage of OA patients and in the cartilage of surgery-induced OA mice further support our data. Importantly, autophagy prevents PKR activation and protects chondrocytes from mitochondrial stress partly by removing cytosolic mtRNAs. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of innate immune activation by mt-dsRNAs during stress responses that underlie the development of OA and suggests mt-dsRNAs as a potential target for chondroprotective intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Microorganisms are generally sensed by receptors recognizing microbial molecules, which evoke changes in cellular activities and gene expression. Bacterial pathogens induce secretion of the danger signal ATP as an early alert response of intestinal epithelial cells, initiating overt inflammation. However, what triggers ATP secretion during infection is unclear. Here we show that the inherently mechanosensitive plasma membrane channel PIEZO1 acts as a sensor for bacterial entry. PIEZO1 is mechanically activated by invasion-induced membrane ruffles upstream of Ca2+ influx and ATP secretion. Mimicking mechanical stimuli of pathogen uptake with sterile beads equally elicits ATP secretion. Chemical or genetic PIEZO1 inactivation inhibits mechanically induced ATP secretion. Moreover, chemical or mechanical PIEZO1 activation evokes gene expression in immune and barrier pathways. Thus, mechanosensation of invasion-induced plasma membrane distortion initiates immune signaling upon infection, independently of detection of microbial molecules. Hence, PIEZO1-dependent detection of infection is driven by physical signals instead of chemical ligands.

Abstract: Summary
The plant circadian clock regulates essential biological processes including flowering time or petal movement. However, little is known about how the clock functions in flowers. Here, we identified the circadian components and transcriptional networks contributing to the generation of rhythms in pistils, the female reproductive organ. When detached from the rest of the flower, pistils sustain highly precise rhythms, indicating organ-specific circadian autonomy. Analyses of clock mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed distinct expression patterns and specific regulatory functions for clock activators and repressors in pistils. Genetic interaction studies also suggested a hierarchy of the repressing activities that provide robustness and precision to the pistil clock. Globally, the circadian function in pistils primarily governs responses to environmental stimuli and photosynthesis and controls pistil growth and seed weight and production. Understanding the circadian intricacies in reproductive organs may prove useful for optimizing plant reproduction and productivity.

Abstract: Summary
Despite essentially symmetric structures in mammalian brains, the left and right hemispheres do not contribute equally to certain cognitive functions. How both hemispheres interact to cause this asymmetry remains unclear. Here, we study this question in the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing five versions of a tactile-based decision-making task with a short-term memory (STM) component. Unilateral inhibition of ALM produces variable behavioral deficits across tasks, with the left, right, or both ALMs playing critical roles in STM. Neural activity and its encoding capability are similar across hemispheres, despite that only one hemisphere dominates in behavior. Inhibition of the dominant ALM disrupts encoding capability in the non-dominant ALM, but not vice versa. Variable behavioral deficits are predicted by the influence on contralateral activity across sessions, mice, and tasks. Together, these results reveal that the left and right ALM interact asymmetrically, leading to their differential contributions to STM.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulatory type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) engage in productive interactions with CD8+ effectors along tumor-stroma boundaries. The paradoxical accumulation of “poised” cDC1s within stromal sheets is unlikely to simply reflect passive exclusion from tumor cores. Drawing parallels with embryonic morphogenesis, we hypothesized that invasive margin stromal remodeling generates developmentally conserved cell fate cues that regulate cDC1 behavior. We find that, in human T cell-inflamed tumors, CD8+ T cells penetrate tumor nests, whereas cDC1s are confined within adjacent stroma that recurrently displays site-specific proteolysis of the matrix proteoglycan versican (VCAN), an essential organ-sculpting modification in development. VCAN is necessary, and its proteolytic fragment (matrikine) versikine is sufficient for cDC1 accumulation. Versikine does not influence tumor-seeding pre-DC differentiation; rather, it orchestrates a distinctive cDC1 activation program conferring exquisite sensitivity to DNA sensing, supported by atypical innate lymphoid cells. Thus, peritumoral stroma mimicking embryonic provisional matrix remodeling regulates cDC1 abundance and activity to elicit T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironments.

Abstract: Diabetes is caused by the destruction of beta-cells in the pancreatic islets. This study was designed to fabricate a favorable bio-scaffold to improve the differentiation of Wharton’s jelly (WJ) mesenchymal stem cells (WMJSCs) to the insulin-secreted cells (ISCs). In this study, a decellularized-WJ scaffold (DWJS) was established and characterized by histological assessments, scanning electron microscopy, determination of residual DNA, and examination of the mechanical tensile property. The WJMSCs were seeded on DWJS and exposed to ISC-differentiation media. The functional maturity of ISCs was examined using Ditizone (DTZ) staining, insulin and C-Peptide secretion, and mRNA expression of insulin-related genes. The main components of the WJ such as collagens, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans remained after decellularization. Very low residual DNA, good mechanical behavior, and appropriate porosity of the DWJS provided an ideal extracellular microenvironment for the ISCs. The insulin secretion of DWJS-seeded ISCs in response to glucose stimulation was significantly more than that in the 2D-culture system. DWJS significantly increased the number of DTZ-positive cells compared to the 2D-culture system. In addition, it enhanced the expression of the PDX-1, GLUT-2, and INS genes in the ISCs. These results collectively provided solid evidence that DWJS is a suitable scaffold for stabilizing the artificial pancreatic island.

Abstract: Summary
Neoantigens arising from mutations in tumor DNA provide targets for immune-based therapy. Here, we report the clinical and immune data from a Phase Ib clinical trial of a personalized neoantigen-vaccine NEO-PV-01 in combination with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This analysis of 38 patients treated with the regimen demonstrated no treatment-related serious adverse events. Multiple parameters including baseline tumor immune infiltration and on-treatment circulating tumor DNA levels were highly correlated with clinical response. De novo neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were observed post-vaccination. Epitope spread to non-vaccinating neoantigens, including responses to KRAS G12C and G12V mutations, were detected post-vaccination. Neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells generated post-vaccination revealed effector and cytotoxic phenotypes with increased CD4+ T cell infiltration in the post-vaccine tumor biopsy. Collectively, these data support the safety and immunogenicity of this regimen in advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic options for treatment of basal-like breast cancers remain limited. Here, we demonstrate that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibition induces an adaptive response leading to MCL1 protein-driven evasion of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Consequently, co-targeting MCL1 and BET is highly synergistic in breast cancer models. The mechanism of adaptive response to BET inhibition involves the upregulation of lipid synthesis enzymes including the rate-limiting stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase. Changes in lipid synthesis pathway are associated with increases in cell motility and membrane fluidity as well as re-localization and activation of HER2/EGFR. In turn, the HER2/EGFR signaling results in the accumulation of and vulnerability to the inhibition of MCL1. Drug response and genomics analyses reveal that MCL1 copy-number alterations are associated with effective BET and MCL1 co-targeting. The high frequency of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications (>30%) in basal-like breast cancers suggests that BET and MCL1 co-targeting may have therapeutic utility in this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Rifampicin (RIF), the frontline drug against M. tuberculosis, is completely ineffective against M. abscessus, partially due to the presence of an ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr) that inactivates RIF. Using RNA-seq, we show that exposure of M. abscessus to sublethal doses of RIF and Rifabutin (RBT), a close analog of RIF, results in an ∼25-fold upregulation of Mab_helR in laboratory and clinical isolates. An isogenic deletion in Mab_helR results in RIF/RBT hypersensitivity, and overexpression of Mab_helR confers RIF tolerance in M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate an increased HelR-RNAP association in RIF-exposed bacteria and a MabHelR-mediated dissociation of RNAP from stalled initiation complexes in vitro. Finally, we show that the tip of the PCh-loop of Mab_helR, present in proximity to RIF, is critical for conferring RIF resistance but dispensable for dissociation of stalled RNAP complexes, suggesting that HelR-mediated RIF resistance requires a step in addition to displacement of RIF-stalled RNAP.

Abstract: Summary
A defining pathological feature of human lung fibrosis is localized tissue heterogeneity, which challenges the interpretation of transcriptomic studies that typically lose spatial information. Here we investigate spatial gene expression in diagnostic tissue using digital profiling technology. We identify distinct, region-specific gene expression signatures as well as shared gene signatures. By integration with single-cell data, we spatially map the cellular composition within and distant from the fibrotic niche, demonstrating discrete changes in homeostatic and pathologic cell populations even in morphologically preserved lung, while through ligand-receptor analysis, we investigate cellular cross-talk within the fibrotic niche. We confirm findings through bioinformatic, tissue, and in vitro analyses, identifying that loss of NFKB inhibitor zeta in alveolar epithelial cells dysregulates the TGFβ/IL-6 signaling axis, which may impair homeostatic responses to environmental stress. Thus, spatially resolved deconvolution advances understanding of cell composition and microenvironment in human lung fibrogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Predatory Myxobacteria employ a multilayered predation strategy to kill and lyse soil microorganisms. Aiming to dissect the mechanism of contact-dependent killing of bacteria, we analyze four protein secretion systems in Myxococcus xanthus and investigate the predation of mutant strains on different timescales. We find that a Tad-like and a type 3-like secretion system (Tad and T3SS∗) fulfill distinct functions during contact-dependent prey killing: the Tad-like system is necessary to induce prey cell death, while the needle-less T3SS∗ initiates prey lysis. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that components of both systems interdependently localize to the predator-prey contact site prior to killing. Swarm expansion assays show that both Tad and T3SS∗ are required to handle live prey and that nutrient extraction from prey bacteria is sufficient to power M. xanthus motility. In conclusion, our observations indicate the functional interplay of two types of secretion systems for killing and lysis of bacterial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Sorafenib is currently the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, sorafenib resistance remains a significant challenge. Aberrant AKT signaling activation is a crucial mechanism driving sorafenib resistance in HCC. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a vital role in antitumor immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant PCSK9 upregulation promotes cell proliferation and sorafenib resistance in HCC by inducing AKT-S473 phosphorylation. After palmitoylation at cysteine 600, the binding affinity between PCSK9 and tensin homolog (PTEN) is dramatically increased, inducing lysosome-mediated PTEN degradation and subsequent AKT activation. We identify zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 16 (ZDHHC16) as a palmitoyltransferase that promotes PCSK9 palmitoylation at cysteine 600. We also develop a biologically active PCSK9-derived peptide that competitively inhibits PCSK9 palmitoylation, suppressing AKT phosphorylation and augmenting the antitumor effects of sorafenib in HCC.

Abstract: DPPA4 is essential for the pluripotent stem cell state, yet its function is poorly understood. DPPA4 is localized in the nucleus, where it is associated with active chromatin. We now report that it is also present in the cytosol, where it appears as diffused clouds, distinct foci and sometimes as spaghetti-like structures. This cytosolic localization is dynamic and DPPA4 shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus. Its presence is almost abolished from the nucleus upon differentiation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies highlighted novel protein interactors, many of which are also found in the cytosol and are implicated in mRNA processing and RNA and protein transport between the cytosol and the nucleus. Finally, the depletion of DPPA4 resulted in cytosolic accumulation of vesicles. The cytosolic presence of DPPA4 highlights unexplored research directions that could significantly advance the understanding of DPPA4 in pluripotent stem cells and in cancer.

Abstract: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit impaired olfactory function and are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Olfactory dysfunction may be an early clinical symptom of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D3 (VD3) exerts neuroprotective effects in mouse models of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of VD3 on the morphology, immunolocalization, and markers involved in neuropathogenic processes, apoptosis, proliferation, cell survival, and clearance of amyloid peptides, along with neuronal markers in the olfactory bulb (OB) of an adult female mouse model of DS. Morphological and molecular analyses revealed that trisomic mice exhibited a volume reduction in the external plexiform layer, a decrease in the number of mitral and granule cells, and an increase in the expression of amyloid-β 42, caspase-3 p12, and P-glycoprotein. VD3 reversed certain morphological abnormalities in the OB of control trisomic mice (Ts(CO)) and decreased the levels of caspase-3 p12 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in the treated groups. The results demonstrated that trisomy factor causes morphofunctional abnormalities in the OB of Ts(CO) mice. Moreover, VD3 could represent a therapeutic target to attenuate morphological and molecular alterations in OB.

Abstract: Summary
Delayed and often impaired wound healing in the elderly presents major medical and socioeconomic challenges. A comprehensive understanding of the cellular/molecular changes that shape complex cell-cell communications in aged skin wounds is lacking. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to define the epithelial, fibroblast, immune cell types, and encompassing heterogeneities in young and aged skin during homeostasis and identify major changes in cell compositions, kinetics, and molecular profiles during wound healing. Our comparative study uncovers a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype in aged skin wounds, featuring neutrophil persistence and higher abundance of an inflammatory/glycolytic Arg1Hi macrophage subset that is more likely to signal to fibroblasts via interleukin (IL)-1 than in young counterparts. We predict systems-level differences in the number, strength, route, and signaling mediators of putative cell-cell communications in young and aged skin wounds. Our study exposes numerous cellular/molecular targets for functional interrogation and provides a hypothesis-generating resource for future wound healing studies.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacterial pathogens antagonize host defense responses by translocating effector proteins into cells. It remains an open question how those pathogens not encoding effectors counteract anti-bacterial immunity. Here, we show that Klebsiella pneumoniae exploits the evolutionary conserved innate protein SARM1 to regulate negatively MyD88- and TRIF-governed inflammation, and the activation of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK. SARM1 is required for Klebsiella induction of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by fine-tuning the p38-type I interferon (IFN) axis. SARM1 inhibits the activation of Klebsiella-induced absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome to limit IL-1β production, suppressing further inflammation. Klebsiella exploits type I IFNs to induce SARM1 in a capsule and lipopolysaccharide O-polysaccharide-dependent manner via the TLR4-TRAM-TRIF-IRF3-IFNAR1 pathway. Absence of SARM1 reduces the intracellular survival of K. pneumoniae in macrophages, whereas sarm1-deficient mice control the infection. Altogether, our results illustrate an anti-immunology strategy deployed by a human pathogen. SARM1 inhibition will show a beneficial effect to treat Klebsiella infections.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleus-forming jumbo phages establish an intricate subcellular organization, enclosing phage genomes within a proteinaceous shell called the phage nucleus. During infection in Pseudomonas, some jumbo phages assemble a bipolar spindle of tubulin-like PhuZ filaments that positions the phage nucleus at midcell and drives its intracellular rotation. This facilitates the distribution of capsids on its surface for genome packaging. Here we show that the Escherichia coli jumbo phage Goslar assembles a phage nucleus surrounded by an array of PhuZ filaments resembling a vortex instead of a bipolar spindle. Expression of a mutant PhuZ protein strongly reduces Goslar phage nucleus rotation, demonstrating that the PhuZ cytoskeletal vortex is necessary for rotating the phage nucleus. While vortex-like cytoskeletal arrays are important in eukaryotes for cytoplasmic streaming and nucleus alignment, this work identifies a coherent assembly of filaments into a vortex-like structure driving intracellular rotation within the prokaryotic cytoplasm.

Abstract: Preproenkephalin (PPE) is a precursor molecule for multiple endogenous opioid peptides Leu-enkephalin (ENK) and Met-ENK, which are involved in a wide variety of modulatory functions in the nervous system. Despite the functional importance of ENK in the brain, the effect of brain-derived factor(s) on PPE expression is unknown. We report the dual effect of neural epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like-like 2 (NELL2) on PPE gene expression. In cultured NIH3T3 cells, transfection of NELL2 expression vectors induced an inhibition of PPE transcription intracellularly, in parallel with downregulation of protein kinase C signaling pathways and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Interestingly, these phenomena were reversed when synthetic NELL2 was administered extracellularly. The in vivo disruption of NELL2 synthesis resulted in an increase in PPE mRNA level in the rat brain, suggesting that the inhibitory action of intracellular NELL2 predominates the activation effect of extracellular NELL2 on PPE gene expression in the brain. Biochemical and molecular studies with mutant NELL2 structures further demonstrated the critical role of EGF-like repeat domains in NELL2 for regulation of PPE transcription. These are the first results to reveal the spatio-specific role of NELL2 in the homeostatic regulation of PPE gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Proteogenomic identification of translated small open reading frames has revealed thousands of previously unannotated, largely uncharacterized microproteins, or polypeptides of less than 100 amino acids, and alternative proteins (alt-proteins) that are co-encoded with canonical proteins and are often larger. The subcellular localizations of microproteins and alt-proteins are generally unknown but can have significant implications for their functions. Proximity biotinylation is an attractive approach to define the protein composition of subcellular compartments in cells and in animals. Here, we developed a high-throughput technology to map unannotated microproteins and alt-proteins to subcellular localizations by proximity biotinylation with TurboID (MicroID). More than 150 microproteins and alt-proteins are associated with subnuclear organelles. One alt-protein, alt-LAMA3, localizes to the nucleolus and functions in pre-rRNA transcription. We applied MicroID in a mouse model, validating expression of a conserved nuclear microprotein, and establishing MicroID for discovery of microproteins and alt-proteins in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) enhances gene regulatory potential by increasing the diversity of mRNA transcripts. 3′ UTR shortening through APA correlates with enhanced cellular proliferation and is a widespread phenomenon in tumor cells. Here, we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1 binds RNA in vivo and is a common repressor of distal poly(A) site usage. RNA sequencing identified 2,344 genes (36% of the total mapped mRNA transcripts) with lengthened 3′ UTRs upon Sp1 depletion. Sp1 preferentially binds the 3′ UTRs of such lengthened transcripts and inhibits cleavage at distal sites by interacting with the subunits of the core cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) machinery. The 3′ UTR lengths of Sp1 target genes in breast cancer patient RNA-seq data correlate with Sp1 expression levels, implicating Sp1-mediated APA regulation in modulating tumorigenic properties. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the mechanism for dynamic APA regulation by unraveling a previously unknown function of the DNA-binding transcription factor Sp1.

Abstract: Background/Aim
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common total joint disorder associated with regulatory T cell (Treg)/IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cell imbalance. This study elucidated the mechanism underlying Th17/Treg imbalance during OA progression.
Methods
CD4+ T cells were isolated and induced to differentiate and obtain Th17 and Treg cells, and an OA mouse model was established by anterior cruciate ligament transection surgery, followed by loss- and gain-of-function assays. Max interacting protein 1 (MXI1), tectonic family member 2 (TCTN2), Forkhead Box Protein P3 (Foxp3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (RORγt) expression was determined in cells and mice, accompanied by the measurement of the proportion of Th17 and Treg cells and the levels of interleukin (IL)− 1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (INF)-γ. Articular cartilage histopathology was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Safranin O-Fast Green staining. Relationship between MXI1 and TCTN2 was assessed.
Results
Bioinformatics analysis identified MXI1 and TCTN2 upregulation in OA patients. Mechanistically, MXI1 bound to TCTN2 promoter to promote its transcription. Upregulated MXI1 boosted INF-γ, STAT3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and RORγt levels and Th17 cell differentiation, but restricted Foxp3 expression and Treg cell differentiation in CD4+ T cells. Effects caused by overexpressed MXI1 were negated by silenced TCTN2. Also, the impacts of MXI1 overexpression on Th17/Treg imbalance and IL-1β, STAT3, TNF-α, Foxp3, INF-γ, and RORγt expression were further validated in OA mice, accompanied by aggravated articular cartilage degeneration.
Conclusion
Conclusively, MXI1 facilitated Th17/Treg imbalance to accelerate OA progression.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulator Runx2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) has essential but distinct roles in osteoblasts and chondrocytes in skeletal development. However, Runx2-mediated regulatory mechanisms underlying the distinctive programming of osteoblasts and chondrocytes are not well understood. Here, we perform an integrative analysis to investigate Runx2-DNA binding and chromatin accessibility ex vivo using neonatal osteoblasts and chondrocytes. We find that Runx2 engages with cell-type-distinct chromatin-accessible regions, potentially interacting with different combinations of transcriptional regulators, forming cell-type-specific hotspots, and potentiating chromatin accessibility. Genetic analysis and direct cellular reprogramming studies suggest that Runx2 is essential for establishment of chromatin accessibility in osteoblasts. Functional enhancer studies identify an Sp7 distal enhancer driven by Runx2-dependent binding and osteoblast-specific chromatin accessibility, contributing to normal osteoblast differentiation. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the regulatory landscape encompassing Runx2-mediated and cell-type-distinct enhancer networks that underlie the specification of osteoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocyte dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, so understanding oligodendrocyte activation states would shed light on disease processes. We identify three distinct activation states of oligodendrocytes from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS): DA1 (disease-associated1, associated with immunogenic genes), DA2 (disease-associated2, associated with genes influencing survival), and IFN (associated with interferon response genes). Spatial analysis of disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DAOs) in the cuprizone model reveals that DA1 and DA2 are established outside of the lesion area during demyelination and that DA1 repopulates the lesion during remyelination. Independent meta-analysis of human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets reveals that the transcriptional responses of MS oligodendrocytes share features with mouse models. In contrast, the oligodendrocyte activation signature observed in human AD is largely distinct from those observed in mice. This catalog of oligodendrocyte activation states (http://research-pub.gene.com/OligoLandscape/) will be important to understand disease progression and develop therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Previous reports showed that mouse vaccination with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) induces durable anti-tumor immune responses via T cell recognition of some elusive oncofetal epitopes. We characterize the MHC I-associated peptide (MAP) repertoire of human induced PSCs (iPSCs) using proteogenomics. Our analyses reveal a set of 46 pluripotency-associated MAPs (paMAPs) absent from the transcriptome of normal tissues and adult stem cells but expressed in PSCs and multiple adult cancers. These paMAPs derive from coding and allegedly non-coding (48%) transcripts involved in pluripotency maintenance, and their expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas samples correlates with source gene hypomethylation and genomic aberrations common across cancer types. We find that several of these paMAPs were immunogenic. However, paMAP expression in tumors coincides with activation of pathways instrumental in immune evasion (WNT, TGF-β, and CDK4/6). We propose that currently available inhibitors of these pathways could synergize with immune targeting of paMAPs for the treatment of poorly differentiated cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its crucial role in initiation of cytotoxic immune responses, the molecular pathways underlying antigen cross-presentation remain incompletely understood. The mechanism of antigen exit from endocytic compartments into the cytosol is a long-standing matter of controversy, confronting two main models: transfer through specific channels/transporters or rupture of endocytic membranes and leakage of luminal content. By monitoring the occurrence of intracellular damage in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), we show that cross-presenting cDC1s display more frequent endomembrane injuries and increased recruitment of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, the main repair system for intracellular membranes, relative to cDC2s. Silencing of CHMP2a or CHMP4b, two effector subunits of ESCRT-III, enhances cytosolic antigen export and cross-presentation. This phenotype is partially reversed by chemical inhibition of RIPK3, suggesting that endocytic damage is related to basal activation of the necroptosis pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Normal organogenesis cannot be recapitulated in vitro for mammalian organs, unlike in species including Drosophila and zebrafish. Available 3D data in the form of ex vivo images only provide discrete snapshots of the development of an organ morphology. Here, we propose a computer-based approach to recreate its continuous evolution in time and space from a set of 3D volumetric images. Our method is based on the remapping of shape data into the space of the coefficients of a spherical harmonics expansion where a smooth interpolation over time is simpler. We tested our approach on mouse limb buds and embryonic hearts. A key advantage of this method is that the resulting 4D trajectory can take advantage of all the available data while also being able to interpolate well through time intervals for which there are little or no data. This allows for a quantitative, data-driven 4D description of mouse limb morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Goal-directed locomotion requires control signals that propagate from higher order areas to regulate spinal mechanisms. The corticosubthalamic hyperdirect pathway offers a short route for cortical information to reach locomotor centers in the brainstem. We developed a task in which head-fixed mice run to a visual landmark and then stop and wait to collect the reward and examined the role of secondary motor cortex (M2) projections to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in controlling locomotion. Our behavioral modeling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics manipulation results suggest that the M2-STN pathway can be recruited during visually guided locomotion to rapidly and precisely control the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) of the mesencephalic locomotor region through the basal ganglia. By capturing the physiological dynamics through a feedback control model and analyzing neuronal signals in M2, PPN, and STN, we find that the corticosubthalamic projections potentially control PPN activity by differentiating an M2 error signal to ensure fast input-output dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays a vital role in brain development and normal physiological functions. Surface trafficking of NMDAR contributes to the modulation of synaptic functions and information processing. However, it remains unclear whether NMDAR trafficking is independent of long-term potentiation (LTP) and whether it regulates behavior. Here, we report that LTP of AMPAR and NMDAR can occur concurrently and that NMDAR trafficking can regulate AMPAR trafficking and AMPAR-mediated LTP. By contrast, AMPAR trafficking does not impact NMDAR-mediated LTP. Using SAP97-interfering peptide and SAP97 knockin (KI) rat, we show that the effect is mediated by GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs. At the behavior level, impaired NMDAR trafficking results in deficits in consolidation, but not acquisition, of fear memory. Collectively, our results suggest the essential role of NMDAR trafficking in LTP and memory consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Gut epithelial morphogenesis is maintained by intestinal stem cells. Here, we report that depletion of N6-adenosine methyltransferase subunit Mettl14 from gut epithelial cells in mice impaired colon mucosal morphogenesis, leading to increased mucosal permeability, severe inflammation, growth retardation, and premature death. Mettl14 ablation triggered apoptosis that depleted Lgr5+ stem cells and disrupted colonic organoid growth and differentiation, whereas the inhibition of apoptosis rescued Mettl14-deleted mice and organoids. Mettl14 depletion disrupted N6-adenomethylation on GsdmC transcripts and abolished GsdmC expression. Reconstitution of Mettl14-deleted organoids or mice with GSDMC rescued Lgr5 expression and prevented apoptosis and mouse premature death, whereas GSDMC silence eliminated LGR5 and triggered apoptosis in human colonic organoids and epithelial cells. Mechanistically, Mettl14 depletion eliminated mitochondrial GsdmC, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered cytochrome c release that activates the pro-apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, GsdmC N6-adenomethylation protects mitochondrial homeostasis and is essential for Lgr5+ cell survival to maintain normal colonic epithelial regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Allosteric activation and silencing of leukocyte β2-integrins transpire through cation-dependent structural changes, which mediate integrin biosynthesis and recycling, and are essential to designing leukocyte-specific drugs. Stepwise addition of Mg2+ reveals two mutually coupled events for the αXβ2 ligand-binding domain—the αX I-domain—corresponding to allostery establishment and affinity maturation. Electrostatic alterations in the Mg2+-binding site establish long-range couplings, leading to both pH- and Mg2+-occupancy-dependent biphasic stability change in the αX I-domain fold. The ligand-binding sensorgrams show composite affinity events for the αX I-domain accounting for the multiplicity of the αX I-domain conformational states existing in the solution. On cell surfaces, increasing Mg2+ concentration enhanced adhesiveness of αXβ2. This work highlights how intrinsically flexible pH- and cation-sensitive architecture endows a unique dynamic continuum to the αI-domain structure on the intact integrin, thereby revealing the importance of allostery establishment and affinity maturation in both extracellular and intracellular integrin events.

Abstract: Summary
Germline Argonautes direct transcriptome surveillance within perinuclear membraneless organelles called nuage. In C. elegans, a family of Vasa-related Germ Line Helicase (GLH) proteins localize in and promote the formation of nuage. Previous studies have implicated GLH proteins in inherited silencing, but direct roles in small-RNA production, Argonaute binding, or mRNA targeting have not been identified. Here we show that GLH proteins compete with each other to control Argonaute pathway specificity, bind directly to Argonaute target mRNAs, and promote the amplification of small RNAs required for transgenerational inheritance. We show that the ATPase cycle of GLH-1 regulates direct binding to the Argonaute WAGO-1, which engages amplified small RNAs. Our findings support a dynamic and direct role for GLH proteins in inherited silencing beyond their role as structural components of nuage.

Abstract: Summary
Copy number variation (CNV) is known to influence human traits, having a rich history of research into common and rare genetic disease, and although CNV is accepted as an important class of genomic variation, progress on copy-number-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has been limited. Here we present a novel method for large-scale copy number analysis from NGS data generating robust copy number estimates and allowing copy number GWASs (CN-GWASs) to be performed genome-wide in discovery mode. We provide a detailed analysis in the UK Biobank resource and a specifically designed software package. We use these methods to perform CN-GWAS analysis across 78 human traits, discovering over 800 genetic associations that are likely to contribute strongly to trait distributions. Finally, we compare CNV and SNP association signals across the same traits and samples, defining specific CNV association classes.

Abstract: Summary
Earlier studies delineated the precise arrangement of proteins that drive neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic signaling at excitatory synapses. However, spatial organization of neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses remains unclear. Here, we took advantage of the molecularly specific interaction of antimalarial artemisinins and the inhibitory synapse scaffold protein, gephyrin, to probe the functional organization of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated neurotransmission in central synapses. Short-term application of artemisinins severely contracts the size and density of gephyrin and GABAaR γ2 subunit clusters. This size contraction elicits a neuronal activity-independent increase in Bdnf expression due to a specific reduction in GABAergic spontaneous, but not evoked, neurotransmission. The same functional effect could be mimicked by disruption of microtubules that link gephyrin to the neuronal cytoskeleton. These results suggest that the GABAergic postsynaptic apparatus possesses a concentric center-surround organization, where the periphery of gephyrin clusters selectively maintains spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission facilitating its autonomous function regulating Bdnf expression.

Abstract: Summary
Evolutionary changes in host-virus interactions can alter the course of infection, but the biophysical and regulatory constraints that shape interface evolution remain largely unexplored. Here, we focus on viral mimicry of host-like motifs that allow binding to host domains and modulation of cellular pathways. We observe that motifs from unrelated viruses preferentially target conserved, widely expressed, and highly connected host proteins, enriched with regulatory and essential functions. The interface residues within these host domains are more conserved and bind a larger number of cellular proteins than similar motif-binding domains that are not known to interact with viruses. In contrast, rapidly evolving viral-binding human proteins form few interactions with other cellular proteins and display high tissue specificity, and their interfaces have few inter-residue contacts. Our results distinguish between conserved and rapidly evolving host-virus interfaces and show how various factors limit host capacity to evolve, allowing for efficient viral subversion of host machineries.

Abstract: Summary
Soft tissue environments govern neuronal morphogenesis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying chemotropism-directed axonal growth cone movement in extremely soft environments remain unclear. Here, we show that drebrin, a growth cone T-zone protein, modulates growth cone turning in response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) coated on a soft substrate. Structurally, axonal growth cones of rodent hippocampal neurons grown on 0.1 kPa hydrogels possess an expanded T zone in which drebrin is highly integrated with both F-actin and microtubules. Biochemically, we identify paxillin as interacting with drebrin in cells grown on 0.1 kPa hydrogels but not on glass coverslips. When grown on 0.1 kPa substrates, growth cones asymmetrically exposed to BDNF-bound stripes exhibit enhanced paxillin-drebrin interaction on the side facing the stripes, an activity that is PKA and AAK1 dependent but independent of Src kinase. Functionally, we show that BDNF-induced growth cone turning and force generation on soft substrates require drebrin phosphorylation and paxillin-drebrin association.

Abstract: Summary
The rapidly emerging field of computational pathology has demonstrated promise in developing objective prognostic models from histology images. However, most prognostic models are either based on histology or genomics alone and do not address how these data sources can be integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally, identifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these models that govern such prognosis is of interest. We use multimodal deep learning to jointly examine pathology whole-slide images and molecular profile data from 14 cancer types. Our weakly supervised, multimodal deep-learning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities to predict outcomes and discover prognostic features that correlate with poor and favorable outcomes. We present all analyses for morphological and molecular correlates of patient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at both a disease and a patient level in an interactive open-access database to allow for further exploration, biomarker discovery, and feature assessment.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatic loci can exhibit different transcriptional states in genetically identical cells. A popular model posits that the inheritance of modified histones is sufficient for inheritance of the silenced state. However, silencing inheritance requires silencers and therefore cannot be driven by the inheritance of modified histones alone. To address these observations, we determined the chromatin architectures produced by strong and weak silencers in Saccharomyces. Strong silencers recruited Sir proteins and silenced the locus in all cells. Strikingly, weakening these silencers reduced Sir protein recruitment and stably silenced the locus in some cells; however, this silenced state could probabilistically convert to an expressed state that lacked Sir protein recruitment. Additionally, changes in the constellation of silencer-bound proteins or the concentration of a structural Sir protein modulated the probability that a locus exhibited the silenced or expressed state. These findings argued that distinct silencer states generate epigenetic states and regulate their dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The basal ganglia operate largely in closed parallel loops, including an associative circuit for goal-directed behavior originating from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and a somatosensory circuit important for habit formation originating from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). An exception to this parallel circuit organization has been proposed to explain how information might be transferred between striatal subregions, for example, from the DMS to the DLS during habit formation. The “ascending spiral hypothesis” proposes that the DMS disinhibits dopamine signaling in the DLS through a tri-synaptic, open-loop striatonigrostriatal circuit. Here, we use transsynaptic and intersectional genetic tools to investigate both closed- and open-loop striatonigrostriatal circuits. We find strong evidence for closed loops, which would allow striatal subregions to regulate their own dopamine release. We also find evidence for functional synapses in open loops. However, these synapses are unable to modulate tonic dopamine neuron firing, questioning the prominence of their role in mediating crosstalk between striatal subregions.

Abstract: Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and further heart failure are major co-morbidities, resulting in the premature death of patients with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). The regulatory effects of kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family members on cardiac function have been extensively studied. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the regulatory effects of KLK8 on RV hypertrophy caused by HPH have yet to be reported. The aim of the present study was to assess KLK8 expression in the RV tissue of HPH-modeled rats, and to further explore the effects and underlying mechanism of KLK8 in regulating the hypertrophy of hypoxia-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes. In HPH model rats, increases in the right ventricle hypertrophy index, the right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiac output, as well as pulmonary artery wall thickness were observed. Western blot analysis revealed that KLK8 expression and MAPK/p53 signaling activity were enhanced in the RVs of rats in an RV HPH rat model. In hypoxia-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes, KLK8 overexpression promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas KLK8 silencing showed the opposite results. KLK8 overexpression increased the expression levels of ventricular hypertrophy markers, including atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and myosin heavy chain 7, which were blocked upon addition of the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190. Conversely, KLK8 silencing caused a decrease in the expression levels of the ventricular hypertrophy markers, which were further reduced via inhibition of the p38 MAPK/p53 signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of the present study have shown that KLK8 may subtly regulate RV hypertrophy, and therefore KLK8 may be a promising therapeutic target for treating HPH-induced RV hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Multicellular synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in living systems. However, how noisy and heterogeneous behaviors of individual cells are integrated across a population toward multicellular synchronization is unclear. Here, we study the process of multicellular calcium synchronization of the endothelial cell monolayer in response to mechanical stimuli. We applied information theory to quantify the asymmetric information transfer between pairs of cells and defined quantitative measures to how single cells receive or transmit information within a multicellular network. Our analysis revealed that multicellular synchronization was established by gradual enhancement of information spread from the single cell to the multicellular scale. Synchronization was associated with heterogeneity in the cells’ communication properties, reinforcement of the cells’ state, and information flow. Altogether, we suggest a phenomenological model where cells gradually learn their local environment, adjust, and reinforce their internal state to stabilize the multicellular network architecture to support information flow from local to global scales toward multicellular synchronization.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOEε4) is the major allelic risk factor for late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD). Inflammation is increasingly considered as critical in sAD initiation and progression. Identifying brain molecular mechanisms that could bridge these two risk factors remain unelucidated. Leveraging induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based strategies, we demonstrate that APOE controls inflammation in human astrocytes by regulating Transgelin 3 (TAGLN3) expression and, ultimately, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. We uncover that APOE4 specifically downregulates TAGLN3, involving histone deacetylases activity, which results in low-grade chronic inflammation and hyperactivated inflammatory responses. We show that APOE4 exerts a dominant negative effect to prime astrocytes toward a pro-inflammatory state that is pharmacologically reversible by TAGLN3 supplementation. We further confirm that TAGLN3 is downregulated in the brain of patients with sAD. Our findings highlight the APOE-TAGLN3-NF-κB axis regulating neuroinflammation in human astrocytes and reveal TAGLN3 as a molecular target to modulate neuroinflammation, as well as a potential biomarker for AD.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles whose dysfunction causes fatal human diseases. Most peroxisomal enzymes are imported from the cytosol by the receptor PEX5, which interacts with a docking complex in the peroxisomal membrane and then returns to the cytosol after monoubiquitination by a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase. The mechanism by which PEX5 shuttles between cytosol and peroxisomes and releases cargo inside the lumen is unclear. Here, we use Xenopus egg extract to demonstrate that PEX5 accompanies cargo completely into the lumen, utilizing WxxxF/Y motifs near its N terminus that bind a lumenal domain of the docking complex. PEX5 recycling is initiated by an amphipathic helix that binds to the lumenal side of the ubiquitin ligase. The N terminus then emerges in the cytosol for monoubiquitination. Finally, PEX5 is extracted from the lumen, resulting in the unfolding of the receptor and cargo release. Our results reveal the unique mechanism by which PEX5 ferries proteins into peroxisomes.

Abstract: Summary
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely dysregulated in cancer, yet their functional roles in cancer hallmarks remain unclear. We employ pooled CRISPR deletion to perturb 831 lncRNAs detected in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and measure their contribution to proliferation, chemoresistance, and migration across two cell backgrounds. Integrative analysis of these data outperforms conventional “dropout” screens in identifying cancer genes while prioritizing disease-relevant lncRNAs with pleiotropic and background-independent roles. Altogether, 80 high-confidence oncogenic lncRNAs are active in NSCLC, which tend to be amplified and overexpressed in tumors. A follow-up antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) screen shortlisted two candidates, Cancer Hallmarks in Lung LncRNA 1 (CHiLL1) and GCAWKR, whose knockdown consistently suppressed cancer hallmarks in two- and three-dimension tumor models. Molecular phenotyping reveals that CHiLL1 and GCAWKR control cellular-level phenotypes via distinct transcriptional networks. This work reveals a multi-dimensional functional lncRNA landscape underlying NSCLC that contains potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary protein restriction (PR) has rapid effects on metabolism including improved glucose and lipid homeostasis, via multiple mechanisms. Here, we investigate responses of fecal microbiome, hepatic transcriptome, and hepatic metabolome to six diets with protein from 18% to 0% of energy in mice. PR alters fecal microbial composition, but metabolic effects are not transferable via fecal transplantation. Hepatic transcriptome and metabolome are significantly altered in diets with lower than 10% energy from protein. Changes upon PR correlate with calorie restriction but with a larger magnitude and specific changes in amino acid (AA) metabolism. PR increases steady-state aspartate, serine, and glutamate and decreases glucose and gluconeogenic intermediates. 13C6 glucose and glycerol tracing reveal increased fractional enrichment in aspartate, serine, and glutamate. Changes remain intact in hepatic ATF4 knockout mice. Together, this demonstrates an ATF4-independent shift in gluconeogenic substrate utilization toward specific AAs, with compensation from glycerol to promote a protein-sparing response.

Abstract: Summary
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have been reported to participate in pre-implantation development of mammalian embryos. In early human embryogenesis, different ERV sub-families are activated in a highly stage-specific manner. How the specificity of ERV activation is achieved remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the mechanism of how LTR7Ys, the human morula-blastocyst-specific HERVH long terminal repeats, are activated by the naive pluripotency transcription network. We find that KLF5 interacts with and rewires NANOG to bind and regulate LTR7Ys; in contrast, the primed-specific LTR7s are preferentially bound by NANOG in the absence of KLF5. The specific activation of LTR7Ys by KLF5 and NANOG in pluripotent stem cells contributes to human-specific naive pluripotency regulation. KLF5-LTR7Y axis also promotes the expression of trophectoderm genes and contributes to the expanded cell potential toward extra-embryonic lineage. Our study suggests that HERVs are activated by cell-state-specific transcription machinery and promote stage-specific transcription network and cell potency.

Abstract: Background
Hydrocortisone (HYD) has been suggested as a drug for anti-sepsis treatment, but its clinical efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to evaluate the function of HYD in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and the molecules involved.
Methods
A mouse model of sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and treated with HYD. The kidney injury biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines in serum samples were determined. The pathological changes in mouse kidney tissues were examined by histological staining. Differentially expressed genes after HYD treatment were screened by microarray analysis. Expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) in the serum samples of septic patients and mouse kidney tissues after HYD treatment was determined. The downstream targets of HSF1 were bioinformatically predicted. Gain- and loss-of-function assays of HSF1 and exportin 1 (XPO1) were performed to validate their functions in AKI.
Results
CLP increased the levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine and the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The levels of these biomarkers and the pathological changes and symptoms in mice induced by CLP were significantly alleviated by HYD treatment. HYD elevated the expression of HSF1, which was initially suppressed by CLP in mice. HSF1 bound to XPO1 promoter to suppress its transcription. Downregulation of HSF1 blocked the protective effects of HYD, but further suppression of XPO1 restored the function of HYD and ameliorated the kidney injury in mice.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that HYD alleviates sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through HSF1-mediated transcriptional suppression of XPO1.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to neuroprotective strategies, neuroregenerative processes could provide targets for stroke recovery. However, the upregulation of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) impedes innate regenerative efforts. Here, we examine the regulatory role of PTPσ (a major proteoglycan receptor) in dampening post-stroke recovery. Use of a receptor modulatory peptide (ISP) or Ptprs gene deletion leads to increased neurite outgrowth and enhanced NSCs migration upon inhibitory CSPG substrates. Post-stroke ISP treatment results in increased axonal sprouting as well as neuroblast migration deeply into the lesion scar with a transcriptional signature reflective of repair. Lastly, peptide treatment post-stroke (initiated acutely or more chronically at 7 days) results in improved behavioral recovery in both motor and cognitive functions. Therefore, we propose that CSPGs induced by stroke play a predominant role in the regulation of neural repair and that blocking CSPG signaling pathways will lead to enhanced neurorepair and functional recovery in stroke.

Abstract: Summary
p62, a well-known adaptor of autophagy, plays multiple functions in response to various stresses. Here, we report a function for p62 in base excision repair that is distinct from its known functions. Loss of p62 impairs base excision repair capacity and increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to alkylating and oxidizing agents. In response to alkylative and oxidative damage, p62 is accumulated in the nucleus,acetylated by hMOF,and deacetylated by SIRT7, and acetylated p62 is recruited to chromatin. The chromatin-enriched p62 directly interacts with APE1, a key enzyme of the BER pathway, and promotes its endonuclease activity, which facilitates BER and cell survival. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that p62 is a regulator of BER and provide further rationale for targeting p62 as a cancer therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Episodic learning and memory retrieval are dependent on hippocampal theta oscillation, thought to rely on the GABAergic network of the medial septum (MS). To test how this network achieves theta synchrony, we recorded MS neurons and hippocampal local field potential simultaneously in anesthetized and awake mice and rats. We show that MS pacemakers synchronize their individual rhythmicity frequencies, akin to coupled pendulum clocks as observed by Huygens. We optogenetically identified them as parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons, while MS glutamatergic neurons provide tonic excitation sufficient to induce theta. In accordance, waxing and waning tonic excitation is sufficient to toggle between theta and non-theta states in a network model of single-compartment inhibitory pacemaker neurons. These results provide experimental and theoretical support to a frequency-synchronization mechanism for pacing hippocampal theta, which may serve as an inspirational prototype for synchronization processes in the central nervous system from Nematoda to Arthropoda to Chordate and Vertebrate phyla.

Abstract: Summary
Cells often adopt different phenotypes, dictated by tissue-specific or local signals such as cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts or molecular micro-environment. This holds in extremis for macrophages with their high phenotypic plasticity. Their broad range of functions, some even opposing, reflects their heterogeneity, and a multitude of subsets has been described in different tissues and diseases. Such micro-environmental imprint cannot be adequately studied by single-cell applications, as cells are detached from their context, while histology-based assessment lacks the phenotypic depth due to limitations in marker combination. Here, we present a novel, integrative approach in which 15-color multispectral imaging allows comprehensive cell classification based on multi-marker expression patterns, followed by downstream analysis pipelines to link their phenotypes to contextual, micro-environmental cues, such as their cellular (“community”) and metabolic (“local lipidome”) niches in complex tissue. The power of this approach is illustrated for myeloid subsets and associated lipid signatures in murine atherosclerotic plaque.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant phase separation of globular proteins is associated with many diseases. Here, we use a model protein system to understand how the unfolded states of globular proteins drive phase separation and the formation of unfolded protein deposits (UPODs). We find that for UPODs to form, the concentrations of unfolded molecules must be above a threshold value. Additionally, unfolded molecules must possess appropriate sequence grammars to drive phase separation. While UPODs recruit molecular chaperones, their compositional profiles are also influenced by synergistic physicochemical interactions governed by the sequence grammars of unfolded proteins and cellular proteins. Overall, the driving forces for phase separation and the compositional profiles of UPODs are governed by the sequence grammars of unfolded proteins. Our studies highlight the need for uncovering the sequence grammars of unfolded proteins that drive UPOD formation and cause gain-of-function interactions whereby proteins are aberrantly recruited into UPODs.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with variable patient responses to therapy. Selinexor, an inhibitor of nuclear export, has shown promising clinical activity for AML. To identify the molecular context for monotherapy sensitivity as well as rational drug combinations, we profile selinexor signaling responses using phosphoproteomics in primary AML patient samples and cell lines. Functional phosphosite scoring reveals that p53 function is required for selinexor sensitivity consistent with enhanced efficacy of selinexor in combination with the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a. Moreover, combining selinexor with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 overcomes dysregulated AKT-FOXO3 signaling in resistant cells, resulting in synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Using high-throughput spatial proteomics to profile subcellular compartments, we measure global proteome and phospho-proteome dynamics, providing direct evidence of nuclear translocation of FOXO3 upon combination treatment. Our data demonstrate the potential of phosphoproteomics and functional phosphorylation site scoring to successfully pinpoint key targetable signaling hubs for rational drug combinations.

Abstract: Summary
RNA editing is a process by which post-transcriptional changes of mRNA nucleotides alter protein function through modification of the amino acid content. The 5HT2C serotonin receptor, which undergoes 32 distinct RNA-editing events leading to 24 protein isoforms, is a notable example of this process. These 5HT2C isoforms display differences in constitutive activity, agonist/inverse agonist potencies, and efficacies. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects of RNA editing, we present four active-state 5HT2C-transducer-coupled structures of three representative isoforms (INI, VGV, and VSV) with the selective drug lorcaserin (Belviq) and the classic psychedelic psilocin. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of agonist activation and constitutive activity across all 24 protein isoforms. Collectively, these findings reveal a unique hydrogen-bonding network located on intracellular loop 2 that is subject to RNA editing, which differentially affects GPCR constitutive and agonist signaling activities.

Abstract: Summary
Interferons (IFNs) are essential in antiviral defense, antitumor effects, and immunoregulatory activities. Although methionine oxidation is associated with various physiological and pathophysiological processes in plants, animals, and humans, its role in immunity remains unclear. We find that the redox cycling of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is an intrinsic cellular biological process, and that impairment of the redox status contributes to STAT2 methionine oxidation, inhibiting its activation. IFN protects STAT2 from methionine oxidation through the recruitment of methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB2, whose enzymatic activity is enhanced by N-acetyltransferase 9 (NAT9), a chaperone of STAT2 defined in this study, upon IFN treatment. Consequently, loss of Nat9 renders mice more susceptible to viral infection. Our study highlights the key function of methionine oxidation in immunity, which provides evidence for the decline of immune function by aging and may provide insights into the clinical applications of IFN in immune-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Using adult zebrafish inner ears as a model for sensorineural regeneration, we ablated the mechanosensory receptors and characterized the single-cell epigenome and transcriptome at consecutive time points during hair cell regeneration. We utilized deep learning on the regeneration-induced open chromatin sequences and identified cell-specific transcription factor (TF) motif patterns. Enhancer activity correlated with gene expression and identified potential gene regulatory networks. A pattern of overlapping Sox- and Six-family TF gene expression and binding motifs was detected, suggesting a combinatorial program of TFs driving regeneration and cell identity. Pseudotime analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data suggested that support cells within the sensory epithelium changed cell identity to a “progenitor” cell population that could differentiate into hair cells. We identified a 2.6 kb DNA enhancer upstream of the sox2 promoter that, when deleted, showed a dominant phenotype that resulted in a hair-cell-regeneration-specific deficit in both the lateral line and adult inner ear.

Abstract: It is well recognized that the neighbor location between cartilage layer and subchondral bone facilitates the intercellular communication and material exchange. However, the evidence that demonstrates the influence of direct communication between cartilage and subchondral bone on their cell behaviors are still partially unknown. In the current study, we established a co-culture system of chondrocytes and osteoblasts aiming to explore the changes of intracellular metabolism of chondrocytes induced by osteoblasts. By using lactate assay kit, RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and western blot, we found that osteoblasts enhanced the glycolysis in chondrocytes by characterizing the changes of lactate secretion and cytoplasmic expression, and gene expressions including glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1 (Gpi1), phosphofructokinase, liver type (Pfkl), lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha), aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate C (Aldoc), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and triosephosphate isomerase 1 (Tpi1). The enhanced glycolysis might be due to the activation of HIF-1 signaling and its downstream target, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDK1), by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. We also detected the up-regulation of ERK and p38/MAPK upstream signaling in chondrocytes induced by osteoblasts by western blot and immunofluorescence. The enhanced glycolysis in chondrocytes induced by osteoblasts could help us to better understand the intracellular metabolic mechanism of chondrocytes and cartilage disease occurrence.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a liver-derived endocrine hormone that functions to regulate energy homeostasis and macronutrient intake. Recently, FGF21 was reported to be produced and secreted from hypothalamic tanycytes, to regulate peripheral lipid metabolism; however, rigorous investigation of FGF21 expression in the brain has yet to be accomplished. Using a mouse model that drives CRE recombinase in FGF21-expressing cells, we demonstrate that FGF21 is not expressed in the hypothalamus, but instead is produced from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), an essential brain region for spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, we find that central FGF21 produced in the RSC enhances spatial memory but does not regulate energy homeostasis or sugar intake. Finally, our data demonstrate that administration of FGF21 prolongs the duration of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and enhances activation of hippocampal neurons. Thus, endogenous and pharmacological FGF21 appear to function in the hippocampus to enhance spatial memory.

Abstract: Summary
Although thousands of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been identified and well characterized, some crucial events in the development of these nAbs during viral infection remain unclear. Using deep sequencing, we explore the dynamics of antibody repertoire in a SARS-CoV-2-infected donor, from whom the potent and broad nAb P2C-1F11 (the parent version of Brii-196) was previously isolated. Further analysis shows a rapid clonal expansion of some SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in early infection. Longitudinal tracing of P2C-1F11 lineage antibodies reveals that these elite nAbs were rare. Using sequence alignment, structure modeling, and bioactivity analysis based on site-mutated assay, we demonstrate that a key substitution F27I in heavy chain contributes significantly to the maturation of P2C-1F11-like antibodies. Overall, our findings elucidate the developmental process and maturation pathway of P2C-1F11, providing some important information for the design of novel immunogens to elicit more potent nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carry mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 that result in over-production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Small molecule inhibitors that block 2-HG synthesis can induce complete morphological remission; however, almost all patients eventually acquire drug resistance and relapse. Using a multi-allelic mouse model of IDH1-mutant AML, we demonstrate that the clinical IDH1 inhibitor AG-120 (ivosidenib) exerts cell-type-dependent effects on leukemic cells, promoting delayed disease regression. Although single-agent AG-120 treatment does not fully eradicate the disease, it increases cycling of rare leukemia stem cells and triggers transcriptional upregulation of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. Accordingly, AG-120 sensitizes IDH1-mutant AML to azacitidine, with the combination of AG-120 and azacitidine showing vastly improved efficacy in vivo. Our data highlight the impact of non-genetic heterogeneity on treatment response and provide a mechanistic rationale for the observed combinatorial effect of AG-120 and azacitidine in patients.

Abstract: Summary
Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) of human tumors is important for tumor progression, treatment response, and drug resistance. However, the spatial distribution of ITH remains incompletely understood. Here, we present spatial analysis of ITH in lung adenocarcinomas from 147 patients using multi-region mass spectrometry of >5,000 regions, single-cell copy number sequencing of ∼2,000 single cells, and cyclic immunofluorescence of >10 million cells. We identified two distinct spatial patterns among tumors, termed clustered and random geographic diversification (GD). These patterns were observed in the same samples using both proteomic and genomic data. The random proteomic GD pattern, which is characterized by decreased cell adhesion and lower levels of tumor-interacting endothelial cells, was significantly associated with increased risk of recurrence or death in two independent patient cohorts. Our study presents comprehensive spatial mapping of ITH in lung adenocarcinoma and provides insights into the mechanisms and clinical consequences of GD.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer patients benefit from early tumor detection since treatment outcomes are more favorable for less advanced cancers. Platelets are involved in cancer progression and are considered a promising biosource for cancer detection, as they alter their RNA content upon local and systemic cues. We show that tumor-educated platelet (TEP) RNA-based blood tests enable the detection of 18 cancer types. With 99% specificity in asymptomatic controls, thromboSeq correctly detected the presence of cancer in two-thirds of 1,096 blood samples from stage I–IV cancer patients and in half of 352 stage I–III tumors. Symptomatic controls, including inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and benign tumors had increased false-positive test results with an average specificity of 78%. Moreover, thromboSeq determined the tumor site of origin in five different tumor types correctly in over 80% of the cancer patients. These results highlight the potential properties of TEP-derived RNA panels to supplement current approaches for blood-based cancer screening.

Abstract: Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside, has shown antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, the therapeutic effects of hesperidin on vascular function and remodelling, and possible underlying mechanisms involved in high-fat/high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet plus 15% fructose in drinking water for 16 weeks. HFFD-fed rats were treated with hesperidin (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for the last 4 weeks. Treatment of HFFD-fed rats with hesperidin significantly attenuated metabolic alterations, vascular endothelial dysfunction and remodelling. Hesperidin markedly alleviated HFFD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation by decreasing plasma malondialdehyde level and aortic superoxide anion production, and by suppressing aortic tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 overexpression. Additionally, increased plasma levels of the adiponectin and nitric oxide metabolite, together with restoration of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, were also observed after treatment with hesperidin. These findings indicated that hesperidin alleviates HFFD-induced vascular dysfunction and remodelling in rats. The possible underlying mechanism may involve the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the restoration of AdipoR1and eNOS expression.

Abstract: Summary
Leishmania are eukaryotic parasites that have retained the ability to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) through evolution. To date, it has been unclear if different DNA entities could be associated with Leishmania EVs and whether these could constitute a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Herein, we investigate the DNA content of EVs derived from drug-resistant parasites, as well as the EVs’ potential to act as shuttles for DNA transfer. Next-generation sequencing and PCR assays confirm the enrichment of amplicons carrying drug-resistance genes associated with EVs. Transfer assays of drug-resistant EVs highlight a significant impact on the phenotype of recipient parasites induced by the expression of the transferred DNA. Recipient parasites display an enhanced growth and better control of oxidative stress. We provide evidence that eukaryotic EVs function as efficient mediators in HGT, thereby facilitating the transmission of drug-resistance genes and increasing the fitness of cells when encountering stressful environments.

Abstract: Summary
The corneal epithelium is renowned for high regenerative potential, which is dependent on the coordinated function of its diverse progenitor subpopulations. However, the molecular pathways governing corneal epithelial progenitor differentiation are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a highly proliferative limbal epithelial progenitor subpopulation characterized by expression of basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) that is capable of holocone formation and corneal epithelial sheet generation. BCAM-positive cells can be found among ABCB5-positive limbal stem cells (LSCs) as well as among ABCB5-negative limbal epithelial cell populations. Mechanistically, we show that BCAM is functionally required for cellular migration and differentiation and that its expression is regulated by the transcription factor p63. In aggregate, our study identifies limbal BCAM expression as a marker of highly proliferative corneal epithelial progenitor cells and defines the role of BCAM as a critical molecular mediator of corneal epithelial differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunctions of network activity and functional connectivity (FC) represent early events in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Astrocytes regulate local neuronal activity in the healthy brain, but their involvement in early network hyperactivity in AD is unknown. We show increased FC in the human cingulate cortex several years before amyloid deposition. We find the same early cingulate FC disruption and neuronal hyperactivity in AppNL-F mice. Crucially, these network disruptions are accompanied by decreased astrocyte calcium signaling. Recovery of astrocytic calcium activity normalizes neuronal hyperactivity and FC, as well as seizure susceptibility and day/night behavioral disruptions. In conclusion, we show that astrocytes mediate initial features of AD and drive clinically relevant phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Cell ablation is a key method in the research fields of developmental biology, tissue regeneration, and tissue homeostasis. Eliminating specific cell populations allows for characterizing interactions that control cell differentiation, death, behavior, and spatial organization of cells. Current methodologies for inducing cell death suffer from relatively slow kinetics, making them unsuitable for analyzing rapid events and following primary and immediate consequences of the ablation. To address this, we developed a cell-ablation system that is based on bacterial toxin/anti-toxin proteins and enables rapid and cell-autonomous elimination of specific cell types and organs in zebrafish embryos. A unique feature of this system is that it uses an anti-toxin, which allows for controlling the degree and timing of ablation and the resulting phenotypes. The transgenic zebrafish generated in this work represent a highly efficient tool for cell ablation, and this approach is applicable to other model organisms as demonstrated here for Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
WNT/β-catenin signaling controls gene expression across biological contexts from development and stem cell homeostasis to diseases including cancer. How β-catenin is recruited to distinct enhancers to activate context-specific transcription is unclear, given that most WNT/ß-catenin-responsive transcription is thought to be mediated by TCF/LEF transcription factors (TFs). With time-resolved multi-omic analyses, we show that SOX TFs can direct lineage-specific WNT-responsive transcription during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into definitive endoderm and neuromesodermal progenitors. We demonstrate that SOX17 and SOX2 are required to recruit β-catenin to lineage-specific WNT-responsive enhancers, many of which are not occupied by TCFs. At TCF-independent enhancers, SOX TFs establish a permissive chromatin landscape and recruit a WNT-enhanceosome complex to activate SOX/ß-catenin-dependent transcription. Given that SOX TFs and the WNT pathway are critical for specification of most cell types, these results have broad mechanistic implications for the specificity of WNT responses across developmental and disease contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Rice blast and bacterial blight, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), respectively, are devastating diseases affecting rice. Here, we report that a rice valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing protein, OsVQ25, balances broad-spectrum disease resistance and plant growth by interacting with a U-Box E3 ligase, OsPUB73, and a transcription factor, OsWRKY53. We show that OsPUB73 positively regulates rice resistance against M. oryzae and Xoo by interacting with and promoting OsVQ25 degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. Knockout mutants of OsVQ25 exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens without a growth penalty. Furthermore, OsVQ25 interacts with and suppresses the transcriptional activity of OsWRKY53, a positive regulator of plant immunity. OsWRKY53 downstream defense-related genes and brassinosteroid signaling genes are upregulated in osvq25 mutants. Our findings reveal a ubiquitin E3 ligase-VQ protein-transcription factor module that fine-tunes plant immunity and growth at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors comprise heterogeneous mixtures of cell states, categorized into neuroendocrine (NE) and non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) transcriptional subtypes. NE to non-NE state transitions, fueled by plasticity, likely underlie adaptability to treatment and dismal survival rates. Here, we apply an archetypal analysis to model plasticity by recasting SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity through multi-task evolutionary theory. Cell line and tumor transcriptomics data fit well in a five-dimensional convex polytope whose vertices optimize tasks reminiscent of pulmonary NE cells, the SCLC normal counterparts. These tasks, supported by knowledge and experimental data, include proliferation, slithering, metabolism, secretion, and injury repair, reflecting cancer hallmarks. SCLC subtypes, either at the population or single-cell level, can be positioned in archetypal space by bulk or single-cell transcriptomics, respectively, and characterized as task specialists or multi-task generalists by the distance from archetype vertex signatures. In the archetype space, modeling single-cell plasticity as a Markovian process along an underlying state manifold indicates that task trade-offs, in response to microenvironmental perturbations or treatment, may drive cell plasticity. Stifling phenotypic transitions and plasticity may provide new targets for much-needed translational advances in SCLC. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Human mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family methyltransferases methylate histone H3 lysine 4 to different methylation states (me1/me2/me3) with distinct functional outputs, but the mechanism underlying the different product specificities of MLL proteins remains unclear. Here, we develop methodologies to quantitatively measure the methylation rate difference between mono-, di-, and tri-methylation steps and demonstrate that MLL proteins possess distinct product specificities in the context of the minimum MLL-RBBP5-ASH2L complex. Comparative structural analyses of MLL complexes by X-ray crystal structures, fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the dynamics of two conserved tyrosine residues at the “F/Y (phenylalanine/tyrosine) switch” positions fine-tune the product specificity. The variation in the intramolecular interaction between SET-N and SET-C affects the F/Y switch dynamics, thus determining the product specificities of MLL proteins. These results indicate a modified F/Y switch rule applicable for most SET domain methyltransferases and implicate the functional divergence of MLL proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Platelets, the often-overlooked component of the immune system, have been shown to promote tumor growth. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disease in the Western world and rising risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unexpectedly, we observed that platelets can inhibit the growth of established HCC in NAFLD mice. Through pharmacological inhibition and genetic depletion of P2Y12 as well as in vivo transfusion of wild-type (WT) or CD40L−/− platelets, we demonstrate that the anti-tumor function of platelets is mediated through P2Y12-dependent CD40L release, which leads to CD8+ T cell activation by the CD40 receptor. Unlike P2Y12 inhibition, blocking platelets with aspirin does not prevent platelet CD40L release nor accelerate HCC in NAFLD mice. Similar findings were observed in liver metastasis models. All together, our study reveals a complex role of platelets in tumor regulation. Anti-platelet treatment without inhibiting CD40L release could be considered for liver cancer patients with NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
High altitude exposes humans to hypobaric hypoxia, which induces various physiological and molecular changes. Recent studies point toward interaction between circadian rhythms and the hypoxic response, yet their human relevance is lacking. Here, we examine the effect of different high altitudes in conjunction with time of day on human whole-blood transcriptome upon an expedition to the highest city in the world, La Rinconada, Peru, which is 5,100 m above sea level. We find that high altitude vastly affects the blood transcriptome and, unexpectedly, does not necessarily follow a monotonic response to altitude elevation. Importantly, we observe daily variance in gene expression, especially immune-related genes, which is largely altitude dependent. Moreover, using a digital cytometry approach, we estimate relative changes in abundance of different cell types and find that the response of several immune cell types is time- and altitude dependent. Taken together, our data provide evidence for interaction between the transcriptional response to hypoxia and the time of day in humans.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic organisms, genetic information is usually carried on multiple chromosomes. Whether and how the number and configuration of chromosomes affect organismal fitness and speciation remain unclear. Here, we have successfully established several single-chromosome fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains, in which the three natural chromosomes have been fused into one giant chromosome in different orders. Chromosome fusions accompanied by the deletions of telomeres and centromeres result in the loss of chromosomal interactions and a drastic change of global chromosome organization, but alter gene expression marginally. The single-chromosome strains display little defects in cell morphology, mitosis, genotoxin sensitivity, and meiosis. Crosses between a wild-type strain and a single-chromosome strain or between two single-chromosome strains with different fusion orders suffer defective meiosis and poor spore viability. We conclude that eukaryotic genomes are robust against dramatic chromosomal reconfiguration, and stochastic changes in chromosome number and genome organization during evolution underlie reproductive isolation and speciation.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies have successfully discovered thousands of common variants associated with human diseases and traits, but the landscape of rare variations in human disease has not been explored at scale. Exome-sequencing studies of population biobanks provide an opportunity to systematically evaluate the impact of rare coding variations across a wide range of phenotypes to discover genes and allelic series relevant to human health and disease. Here, we present results from systematic association analyses of 4,529 phenotypes using single-variant and gene tests of 394,841 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome-sequence data. We find that the discovery of genetic associations is tightly linked to frequency and is correlated with metrics of deleteriousness and natural selection. We highlight biological findings elucidated by these data and release the dataset as a public resource alongside the Genebass browser for rapidly exploring rare-variant association results.
