Abstract: A new effective sealing method was developed for application in dye-sensitized solar cells. The sealing method employs a cord of a low temperature fusing glass frit paste that bounds the entire perimeter of the substrate. The glass precursor was heated to its melting point assisted by a laser beam, allowing the two substrates of the cell to be completely sealed. In the present work, the feasibility of this laser assisted glass paste sealing process is investigated and the best laser operating conditions are determined. Different tests were performed to the sealed samples at optimized sealing conditions and conclusions drawn. The glass-sealed samples were compared with results from conventional sealing based on commercial thermoplastics sealants. The results obtained from leakage, temperature and strength tests showed that the glass-sealing technique is better than the conventional method.

Abstract: In this article, we have systematically studied the effect of molecular weight on poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(5,5′-thienyl-4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′bithiazole)-2,6-diyl], a novel cathodically coloring electrochromic polymer. The polymer with higher molecular weight can stack much better due to the stronger π–π⁎ interaction and was found to exhibit better charge transfer property and lower internal resistance. These results have shown to enhance the coloration efficiency of the polymer remarkably. For the molecular weight of 33.6kg/mol, the coloration efficiency is 423cm2/C, much higher compared with the low molecular weight polymer (6.3kg/mol, 226cm2/C).

Abstract: Large area polymer tandem solar cells completely processed using roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and printing techniques are demonstrated. A stable tandem structure was achieved by the use of orthogonal ink solvents for the coating of all layers, including both active layers. Processing solvents included water, alcohols and chlorobenzene. Open-circuit voltages close to the expected sum of sub cell voltages were achieved, while the overall efficiency of the tandem cells was found to be limited by the low yielding back cell, which was processed from water based ink. Many of the challenges associated with upscaling the multilayer tandem cells were identified giving valuable information for future experiments and development.

Abstract: In this study the geometrical optimization of monolithically integrated solar cells into serially connected solar modules is reported. Based on the experimental determination of electrodes′ sheet and intermittent contact resistances, the overall series resistance of individual solar cells and interconnected solar modules is calculated. Taking a constant photocurrent generation density into account, the total Joule respectively resistive power losses are determined by a self-consistent simulation according to the 1-diode model. This method allows optimization of the solar module geometry depending on the material system applied. As an example, polymer solar modules based on ITO-electrodes and ITO-free electrodes were optimized with respect to structuring dimensions.

Abstract: Time stability of dye-sensitized solar cells based on ZnO sphere aggregates sensitized by N719 was systematically investigated. Eight cells in two groups were involved in this study. Each group has four cells that were connected in series and were used to supply the power to a light emission diode. Group 1 was kept in a room and Group 2 was kept outside ambient condition. The duration was half a year. The cells of the two groups can maintain about 90% of their initial efficiency after half a year running. The decrease of efficiency mainly results from about 15% drop of current density in the first week. Then the current density remained unvaried in the following days no matter whether the cells were kept in the room or outside ambient condition. The open-circuit voltages of these cells increased from 0.67–0.72 to 0.71–0.76V in the first week and then kept unvaried in the following operation. These results indicate an excellent time stability of DSCs based on aggregates of ZnO spheres sensitized by N719 and suggest a great potential for practice use.

Abstract: The photoelectrochromic window represents a special kind of self-powered smart window; it can change transmittance using electrical energy that itself converted from solar energy. In this paper, we report a novel photoelectrochromic device based on an electrochromic film of poly(3,4-(2,2-dimethylpropylenedioxy)thiophene) we synthesized and an organic ruthenium complex dye. The addition of a thin layer of platinum under the electrochromic layer to act as a catalyst allowed the assembled device to perform with fast response times (one and four seconds for coloring and bleaching, respectively) and with a 38% transmittance difference between the two states. The electrochemical impedance study also indicated that the device has dual application of color-change and energy-harvest.

Abstract: A new PSG doping process was developed using a sol-gel method with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) powder combined with a screen-printing technique for the fabrication of electrodes. This process was applied in silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays based solar cells. The PSG-doped SiNW arrays were used as both the anti-reflectance layer and the n+ emitter for the solar cells. The morphology and photoelectric characteristics of the SiNW array solar cells were measured by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer, a quantum efficiency measurement system and a solar cell simulator. It was found that the reflectivity (Rλ), internal quantum efficiency (IQE), series resistance (Rs) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were influenced by the aspect ratio and the density of the PSG-doped SiNW arrays. Results indicate that there is a competition phenomenon between the aspect ratio and the density. It was observed that certain aspect ratio (∼5.15) with appropriate density (∼34.5%) of PSG-doped straight-aligned SiNW arrays possessed better solar cell (∼10.15%) performance. The SiNW array solar cells showed potential for low cost and mass-production in commercial solar cells applications.

Abstract: Photovoltaic cells need to have a long operative lifetime, in order to be competitive against the so-called polluting sources. In particular, thin-film technologies such as CIGS suffer from degradation due to moisture ingress into the panel. An edge sealing tape applied in addition to a standard lamination foil used in the encapsulation process can strongly reduce the moisture permeation and degradation.

Abstract: Efficient and stable Bulk Heterojunction polymer solar cells based on a P3HT:PC61BM active layer have been fabricated by inserting a convenient, low cost, solution-processed, PEDOT/PSS anode buffer layer doped with solution-processed MoO3. The MoO3 consist of small “islands” in the blend film extends the interfacial contact area between the P3HT:PC61BM and PEDOT/PSS to facilitate hole collection, and meanwhile blocking electron transport at the anode. Hence the improved Jsc and FF dramatically increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 2.98% to 3.94%. After anode buffer layer doped with the MoO3, the device stability also has a significant improvement.

Abstract: There is a renewed interest in photovoltaic solar thermal (PVT) hybrid systems, which harvest solar energy for heat and electricity. Typically, a main focus of a PVT system is to cool the photovoltaic (PV) cells to improve the electrical performance; however, this causes the thermal component to under-perform compared to a solar thermal collector. The low temperature coefficients of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) allow the PV cells to be operated at high temperatures, which are a potential candidate for a more symbiotic PVT system. The fundamental challenge of a-Si:H PV is light-induced degradation known as the Staebler–Wronski effect (SWE). Fortunately, SWE is reversible and the a-Si:H PV efficiency can be returned to its initial state if the cell is annealed. Thus an opportunity exists to deposit a-Si:H directly on the solar thermal absorber plate where the cells could reach the high temperatures required for annealing. In this study, this opportunity is explored experimentally. First a-Si:H PV cells were annealed for 1h at 100°C on a 12h cycle and for the remaining time the cells were degraded at 50°C in order to simulate stagnation of a PVT system for 1h once a day. It was found when comparing the cells after stabilization at normal 50°C degradation that this annealing sequence resulted in a 10.6% energy gain when compared to a cell that was only degraded at 50°C.

Abstract: The apparent carrier density profile measured by the capacitance–voltage technique in CdTe thin-film solar cells frequently displays a distinctive U-shape. We show that, even assuming a uniform carrier density, such a U-shape may arise from deep levels, a non-ohmic back-contact, and a thin absorber, which are commonly present in practical CdTe thin-film solar cells. A thin CdTe absorber contributes to the right branch of the U-shape due to a punch-through effect at reverse or zero biases, when the CdTe absorber is nearly fully depleted. A rectifying back-contact contributes to both branches of the U-shape due to voltage sharing with the front junction under a forward bias and early punch-through under a reverse bias. Deep levels contribute to the right branch, but also raise the bottom of the U-shape, leading to an overestimate of carrier density.

Abstract: Electrochromic performance of tungsten oxide (WO3) has attracted extensive interest due to its applications in smart windows, spacecraft thermal control and other optical devices. Here we report ordered macroporous WO3 thin films prepared by the template-assisted sol–gel method. The principle finding of the paper is that the ordered multi-layer interconnected porous structure facilitates the diffusion of ions/electrons as well as the light transmission. Consequently we see improved IR optical modulation and faster response time in the macroporous WO3 films. Moreover, both small pore size and perfection of ordered porous structure contribute to the improved electrochromic performance. These results have obvious practical relevance for fast near IR electrochromic devices exemplified by aerospace thermal control systems.

Abstract: Tricyanofuran-based small molecules were synthesized through Knoevenagel reaction with formyl heteroaromatic donating moieties and 2-cyanomethylene-3-cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran (TCF) as a strong acceptor. UV–vis absorption demonstrated that the combination of TCF with donating units resulted in an enhanced intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, which led to long wavelength absorption in the chromophores. The absorption coefficients and the molecular energy levels of the chromophores can be tuned effectively by employing different donating groups. The chromophores were used in conjunction with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to fabricate organic heterojunction photovoltaic cells. This solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.44%, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 8.74mA/cm2, and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.93V under simulated air mass 1.5 global irradiation (100mW/cm2).

Abstract: In this study, a novel microencapsulated phase change material (palmitic acid@AlOOH) was prepared using an in situ emulsion interfacial poly-condensation method. The resulting colloidal-sphere microcapsules, with diameter around 200nm, are of core-shell microstructures. Characteristic peaks of both palmitic acid and AlOOH can be observed during their IR spectrum characterization. According to the TGA examinations, the encapsulated ratios of palmitic acid (PA) to PA@AlOOH are 52%, 57% and 69%. The DSC results indicate that melting temperatures of the microencapsulated PCMs are remarkably 50°C lower than those of pristine PA, which might originate from the strong interface interactions between the core and shell of PA@AlOOH. The thermal storage capabilities of the microcapsules are also tested. The method and mechanism of this study can be extended to design other organics@inorganics PCMs with different core-shell structured compositions.

Abstract: For deposition of a-Si:H p–i–n solar cells, a single-chamber plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process at the frequency of 13.56MHz is developed. A 40×40cm² deposition chamber, which represents typical industry reactors equipped with showerhead electrodes is employed. Various methods are applied to reduce the boron-cross contamination from the boron-doped p-layer into the intrinsic layer, which is considered to reduce solar cell efficiency by losses especially in the short wavelength range. Three different device configurations and four different chamber treatment methods are studied, aimed to reach stable device efficiencies comparable to multi-chamber systems at minimum chamber treatment effort and treatment time. An ex-situ CO2–plasma treatment applied after deposition of the p-doped layer is found to be effective to reduce boron-cross contamination. However, this CO2-treatment is a time-consuming process step for production. We found a less time consuming treatment: by a chamber evacuation to 9×10−7mbar subsequent to p-layer deposition. Initial and stable efficiencies of 10.2% and 7.7%, respectively, were obtained. This latter treatment results in a sharp drop of the boron concentration from ∼5×1020cm−3 in the p-doped layer to ∼1017cm−3 in the intrinsic layer. For comparison of different reactor geometries and their influence on the cross-contamination we used a small-area (10×10cm2) lab-type reactor.

Abstract: The structural and photoluminescent properties as well as the evolution of photo-generated excitons were studied in combination with the effects of thermal annealing for c-axis oriented nanocrystalline zinc oxide (nc-ZnO) films on Si (100) prepared by plasma assisted reactive pulsed laser deposition. The extra energy and the reactive oxygen species provided by ECR oxygen plasma result in the low-temperature c-axis oriented growth of nc-ZnO with wurtzite structure and low density of oxygen vacancies in the grown ZnO. The annealing process leads to the improvement of crystallinity and the growth of crystallites at the expense of the introduction of oxygen vacancies. The prepared nc-ZnO films emit strong near band edge (NBE) photoluminescence (PL) associated with longitudinal optical (LO) phonon replicas of free and bound excitons at 325nm light excitation at 7K. The temperature-dependent PL features reveal the evolution of radiative recombination processes with temperature and indicate that the room-temperature NBE luminescence is dominated by the LO phonon replicas of free excitons, whereas inappreciable visible emission in the room-temperature PL from as-deposited nc-ZnO suggests low-density oxygen vacancies in the samples.

Abstract: Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1, PPM1D) is induced by p53 in response to various stressors and dephosphorylates cellular target proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. The Wip1 gene is frequently amplified or overexpressed in human cancers, promoting tumor growth by switching off major checkpoint kinases and p53. To explore wild-type p53-independent Wip1 induction, Wip1 promoter activity and its transcript level were evaluated by luciferase assay and real-time PCR, after methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) treatment in breast cancer cell lines and p53-null cell lines. Wip1 promoter activities in response to UV irradiation and various anti-cancer agents were compared between wild-type and a p53-response element (p53RE) mutated construct. Wip1 expression and its effects were examined in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colon tumor cells by using Wip1-specific siRNA. MMS induced Wip1 promoter activity in Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 cells expressing DNA binding-deficient p53 mutants. A549-E6 and HCT116 (p53−/−) cells retained substantial Wip1 induction. Wip1 promoter activity was reduced, but not eliminated, in cells expressing a promoter containing a mutated p53-response element. Wip1 induction was not blocked by SB202190 or SP600125. MMS increased Wip1 expression in primary non-small cell lung cancer cells expressing a p53 R175H mutant. Our data indicate that Wip1 is induced in the absence of functional p53, like p38 MAPK and JNK, as a stress response terminator.

Abstract: Cancer cells have elevated aerobic glycolysis that is termed the Warburg effect. But several tumor cells, including leukemic cells, also increase glutamine metabolism, which is initiated by glutaminase (GLS). The microRNA (miRNA) miR-23 targets GLS mRNA and inhibits expression of GLS protein. Here we show that in human leukemic Jurkat cells the NF-κB p65 subunit binds to miR-23a promoter and inhibits miR-23a expression. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors release p65-induced inhibition. Jurkat cells growing in glutamine decrease proliferation due to cell accumulation in G0/G1 phase. Nevertheless, cells get used to this new source of energy by increasing GLS expression, which correlates with an increase in p65 expression and its translocation to the nucleus, leading to a higher basal NF-κB activity. Jurkat cells overexpressing p65 show increase basal GLS expression and proliferate faster than control cells in glutamine medium. Overexpressing miR-23a in leukemic cells impaired glutamine use and induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death. Therefore, p65 activation decreases miR-23a expression, which facilitates glutamine consumption allowing leukemic cells to use this alternative source of carbon and favoring their adaptation to the metabolic environment.

Abstract: Copper-based multilayer transparent electrodes (MTEs) consisting of a dielectric-metal-dielectric (DMD) structure are explored as a replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in an effort to realize truly low-cost organic solar cells (OSCs). The outer dielectric is shown to play an important role not only in tuning the optical properties of MTEs but also in improving the electrical characteristics of Cu layers, thus providing both high transmission and low sheet resistance. We demonstrate that devices with the optimized Cu-based MTEs can have power conversion efficiency that is as high as 87% of that of ITO-based conventional cells, despite the absorption by Cu in the visible spectrum.

Abstract: We report substantial improvements in efficiency and thermal stability of the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (P3HT:PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) system by adding a diblock copolymer P3HT-b-P(St89BAz11)-C60 (P3HT=poly (3-hexylthiophene), St=styrene, BAz=benzyl azide) as a compatibilizer. Small amounts of the diblock copolymer alter the interfacial morphology between the P3HT and PCBM components, resulting in a noticeable difference in phase segregation of the BHJ films, as evident in atomic force microscopy images. The best performance is observed in the P3HT:PCBM cell with 10% P3HT-b-P(St89BAz11)-C60, which exhibits substantially improved power conversion efficiency and thermal stability compared to the P3HT:PCBM control device.

Abstract: A low-cost and novel nanostructure heterojunction, which consists of the CuInSe2 nanocrystals (NCs)/CdS quantum dots (QDs)/ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays, is fabricated for photovoltaic applications. The ZnO NW arrays with high transmittance are used as a highly efficient channel for rapid collection of the carriers to reduce the charge recombination, as well as to increase the contact area of the heterojunction. The p-type CuInSe2 NCs are synthesized by a solvothermal method and then deposited on the CdS QDs coated ZnO NW arrays by an electrophoretic deposition technique. Results indicate that such a heterojunction configuration not only has high absorption for the incident light in the visible region but also can reduce the leakage current. A photovoltaic efficiency of the heterojunction is doubled as compared with that of the CuInSe2 NCs/CdS QDs/ZnO thin film photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: In this work, an electrodeposited nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructure used as an anode buffer layer in organic photovoltaic cells has been studied. The structure of NiO films are tailored by current density and electrodeposition time to have nano-islands or interconnecting nano-rods on indium tin oxide surface. When –CF3-modified NiO structures are used as hole transporting and electron blocking layers, the device performance is affected by the structure and electronic properties of NiO films. The best power conversion efficiency (3.05%) is achieved under an illumination of AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) for a device with the interconnecting nano-rods NiO buffer layer. This electrodepositing of NiO nanostructures provides an inexpensive and facile method to fabricate an efficient anode buffer for high performance photovoltaic device.

Abstract: The influence of octanedithiol (ODT) on the film morphology of PCPDTBT:PCBM (1:2) blends processed from solutions in chlorobenzene was studied by chemical shift selective carbon-13 solid-state NMR relaxation experiments. A close contact between PCBM and PCPDTBT is demonstrated for PCPDTBT:PCBM films processed with as well as without ODT, i.e. the dimensions of the substructures in the PCBM rich and polymer rich domains are smaller than 10nm. The PCBM organization is shown to be reduced towards very small and weakly organized clusters. The main difference of processing the active film in the presence of ODT can be found in the ability of the polymer to improve its chain packing towards a state that closely resembles this of pure PCPDTBT. This difference in physical interaction between the polymer chains can explain the improved power conversion efficiency and the EQE red-shift of solar cells processed with ODT.

Abstract: To enhance the performance and understanding of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs), we have investigated the influence of organic solar cell geometry on power loss and device efficiency using three-dimensional finite element (3-D FE) simulation. To investigate the influence of geometry on power loss, we have proposed a new simple finite element (FE) model of OPV structure. We have checked the characteristics of the voltage drop on the ITO electrode layer and found that this model is suitable for describing the basic operation of an OPV. We have also simulated various geometries using a 3-D FE simulation and discussed these simulations in the paper. The total power loss obtained from the 3-D FE simulation allows us to compute the power conversion efficiencies of the eight OPVs and compare the computations against measured results. Based on these results, we discuss how to minimize resistance losses in the ITO electrode layer of the OPVs and propose a simple method to estimate easily the power losses using an FE simulation. We expect that this work could contribute to enhancing OPV performance to a certain large-area and offer insights into the design.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular endothelial cell (VEC) dysfunction is an important contributing factor in vascular diseases. Recently, we found that LPS impaired VEC by inducing autophagy. Our previous researches showed that a butyrolactone derivative, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO) selectively protected VEC function. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether and how 3BDO inhibits LPS-induced VEC autophagic injury. Our results showed that LPS induced autophagy and led to increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in Human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, LPS significantly increased p8 and p53 protein levels and the nuclear translocation of p53. All of these effects of LPS on HUVECs were strongly inhibited by 3BDO. Importantly, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibited LPS-induced autophagy and knockdown of p8 by RNA interference inhibited the autophagy, p53 protein level increase, the translocation of p53 into nuclei and the ROS level increase induced by LPS in HUVECs. The data suggested that 3BDO inhibited LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs through inhibiting the ROS overproduction, the increase of p8 and p53 expression and the nuclear translocation of p53. Our findings provide a potential tool for understanding the mechanism underlying LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs and open the door to a novel therapeutic drug for LPS-induced vascular diseases.

Abstract: A series of initial experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid photocatalytic–photovoltaic systems for simultaneous water purification and electricity generation have been conducted. Commercial TiO2 (Aeroxide P25) suspended nanoparticles have been used as a photocatalyst and an organic dye (Methylene Blue) as a pollutant. The photovoltaic output of the hybrid system was observed to be related to MB dye photodegradation, whereby as the pollutant degraded the optical transmission to the cell improved. When the dye decolourisation was complete, the increase in photovoltaic output was between 32 and 37% depending on the initial dye concentration. The findings indicate both technologies can work simultaneously, producing drinking water and generating electricity to feed a pump, which establishes the path for a complete autonomous system.

Abstract: The accuracy of photoconductance-based minority carrier lifetime measurement techniques is studied in detail. Regarding their accuracy and comparability, the quasi steady state photoconductance (QSSPC) as well as the novel steady state microwave detected photoconductivity (MDP) method are compared with the traditional microwave detected photoconductance decay (μPCD). We show that differences in measurement conditions and analyzing procedures lead to deviating results. Calculations based on a generalized rate equation system are used to model the photoconductivity and the resulting effective lifetime for different measurement conditions and defect models. The simulation results are compared to measurements on several mono- and multicrystalline silicon samples with and without surface passivation. Our results clearly show, that for low as well as high injection conditions deviations occur for the measurement and analysis techniques investigated. To allow for a comparison of lifetime data, we recommend to report exact measurement conditions and analysis procedures as well as to perform measurements in a certain injection range. Only if no trapping effects are present and the penetration depth of the applied method is significantly larger than the sample width, accurate and comparable lifetime results can be achieved.

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of dip coating technology as a fabrication tool for highly efficient polymer solar cells. We investigate the critical parameters for dip coating deposition of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to obtain optimized active layers. These parameters include the selection of organic solvent, solution concentration and room temperature. Structure and morphology of dip coated films are characterized via X-ray diffraction, UV–visible absorption spectra and atomic force microscopy. We achieve dip coated devices with power conversion efficiency of 3.93%, with fill factor, short circuit current and open circuit voltage of 0.63, 10.62mAcm−2 and 0.60V, respectively, even though the devices were fabricated in air without any annealing treatment.

Abstract: Hsp27 and clusterin (CLU are stress-activated small heat shock proteins that are up-regulated in many cancers where they play important roles in stress-induced protein homeostasis (proteostasis), inhibition of cell death pathways, and modulation of pro-survival signaling and transcriptional networks. They are associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in many cancers, protecting cells from many varied therapeutic stressors that induce apoptosis, including androgen or estrogen withdrawal, radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and biologic agents. Both Hsp27 and sCLU are ATP-independent molecular chaperones making them less amenable to inhibition by small molecules, and so strategies to inhibit Hsp27 and sCLU at the gene-expression level are appealing. Indeed, known nucleotide sequences of cancer-relevant genes offer the possibility to rapidly design antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for loss-of-function and preclinical proof-of-principle studies and subsequent clinical use. Here, we will review the rationale for Hsp27 and sCLU as therapeutic targets in cancer, and update the current status of pre-clinical and clinical studies using Hsp27 and CLU inhibitors, OGX-427 and OGX-011, respectively. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Cellular uptake of vector peptides used for internalization of hydrophilic molecules into cells is known to follow two different pathways: direct translocation of the plasma membrane and internalization by endocytosis followed by release into the cytosol. These pathways differ in their energy dependence. The first does not need metabolic energy while the second requires metabolic energy. Herein we used erythrocytes and plasma membrane vesicles to study membrane perturbations induced by the cell penetrating peptide penetratin. The results show that cell penetrating peptides are able to be internalized by two metabolic energy-independent pathways: direct crossing of the plasma membrane and endocytosis-like mechanisms. The last mechanism involves the induction of membrane negative curvature resulting in invaginations that mimic the endosomal uptake in the absence of ATP. This new mechanism called “physical endocytosis” or “self-induced endocytosis” might explain different data concerning the independence or dependence on metabolic energy during cellular uptake and reveals the autonomous capacity of peptides to induce their internalization.

Abstract: In this study, we aimed at systematically determining the potential of the zone melting (ZM) technique to remove impurities from Metallurgical Grade Silicon (MG- Si) in an Electron Beam Furnace (EBF), using a water-cooled copper crucible. Our focus was on obtaining solar grade silicon, with the purity between Electronic Grade Silicon (EG-Si) and MG-Si, at lower cost than the silicon obtained by the Siemens process. The MG- Si (99.855% purity in mass, or 1,450ppm of impurities) was processed by 1 and 2 passes of ZM at speed of 1mm/min and 10mm/min. The ZM process reduced in 98% the total amount of impurities present in the MG-Si, increasing the purity from 99% to 99.999%, an intermediate stage to achieve the electronic grade (> 99.9999%). Boron remained near the same after the ZM due to its vapor pressure be lower than the pressure of the furnace chamber and due its distribution coefficient in silicon be near the unit. Carbon and oxygen in the MG-Si were reduced from 106 to 35ppm and from 30ppm to 5ppm, respectively, after ZM, and these values are very close to the levels in the electronic grade silicon. The electrical resistivity showed to be dependent on the boron concentration, but not on the phosphorus or the total amount of impurities. All ingots processed by ZM exhibited p-type characteristics, and it means that boron was really the dominant dopant.

Abstract: A study of the optical and impedance behavior of optimized standard and inverted photovoltaic solar cells based on P3HT:PCBM active nano composites is presented. The standard cells sequence is ITO/HTL1/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al and the inverted cells one is ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/HTL2/Ag where HTL1 and HTL2 are Hole Transport Layers. Absorption and action spectra, together with I–V characteristics, are shown to be quite similar and lead to 4.05% and 3.90% energy conversions, for standard and inverted cells, respectively. Built-in potentials of 0.82–0.89V and acceptor impurities concentrations of 1.6–2.4 1015cm−3 are found through capacitance measurements. Impedance spectrometry shows the classical two-circle complex plan curves, one being related to the effective lifetime of charge carriers before recombination at low frequency, and the other one to the diffusion time of these carriers at high frequency. The shape of the curves is identical, showing the ohmic role of the ZnO layer. It is shown that overall resistances in the dark are higher for inverted cells as compared to standard ones, and that this feature is inverted under illumination, with a thousand-time decrease. Global mobilities are in the range 3.8–4.6 10−3cm2V−1s−1, which is slightly higher as compared to the literature. Four different equivalent circuit models are tested on experimental results, and it is concluded that the classical RCPE model (or its Garcia–Belmonte variant) is suitable for this kind of cells.

Abstract: Renal hypertrophy and extracellular matrix accumulation are early features of diabetic nephropathy. Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress is implicated in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy. Resveratrol has potent antioxidative and protective effects on diabetic nephropathy. We aimed to examine whether high glucose (HG)-induced NADPH oxidase activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contribute to glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin expression and the effect of resveratrol on HG action in mesangial cells. By using rat mesangial cell line and primary mesangial cells, we found that NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) and ROS inhibitor (N-acetyl cysteine) both inhibited HG-induced mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin expression. HG-induced elevation of NADPH oxidase activity and production of ROS in mesangial cells was inhibited by apocynin. These results suggest that HG induces mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin expression through NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production. Mechanistic studies revealed that HG upregulated NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and p47phox expression through JNK/NF-κB pathway, which resulted in elevation of NADPH oxidase activity and consequent ROS production. Resveratrol prevented HG-induced mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin expression through inhibiting HG-induced JNK and NF-κB activation, NADPH oxidase activity elevation and ROS production. These results demonstrate that HG enhances mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin expression through JNK/NF-κB/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, which was inhibited by resveratrol. Our findings provide novel therapeutic targets for diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have been shown to have excellent indoor efficiency at light intensities as low as one 10W/m2. To fully explore their low light efficiency potential, the density as well as severeness of shunts must be kept as low as possible. In this communication we discuss a novel thermography method allowing to image the shunt distribution in organic solar modules with no electrical contact to the module. This thermography method is based on light excitation (ILIT—illuminated lock in thermography) instead of dark current excitation (DLIT—dark lock-in thermography). Comparison of ILIT with DLIT images reveals the equivalence of these two modes for shunt detection, with ILIT having the advantage of being performed in non-contact mode.

Abstract: The ultrafine composite fibers consisting of lauric acid (LA) and polyamide 6 (PA6) with varied LA/PA6 mass ratios of 80/100, 100/100, 120/100, and 150/100 were prepared via the technique of electrospinning as form-stable phase change materials (PCMs); morphological structures of the fibers were characterized, and their thermal stability and thermal energy storage properties were investigated. SEM results indicated that electrospun LA/PA6 composite fibers possessed the ribbon-shaped morphology with fiber diameters slightly larger than those of the neat PA6 fibers. The study revealed that the LA primarily existed as phase separated domains and the domains were randomly dispersed in as-electrospun ultrafine composite fibers. To reveal the evolution of morphological structures and the resulting properties for storage and retrieval of thermal energy, the heat treatment at 60°C for the electrospun composite fibers with LA/PA6 mass ratio of 100/100 was carried out; upon the heat treatment, the complete encapsulation of LA domains inside PA6 matrices would occur, and the heat-treated fibers might even possess the partial core/sheath structure with LA being the core and PA6 being the sheath. TGA results indicated that the degradation of electrospun LA/PA6 ultrafine composite fibers had two steps, and the charred residue at 700°C of the composite fibers was lower than that of the neat PA6 fibers. DSC measurements suggested that the amount of LA in the fibers played an important role on the values of heat enthalpies for the composite fibers; while it had no appreciable effect on the temperatures of phase transitions. After the heat treatment, the values of heat enthalpies for the composite fibers decreased slightly and this was due to the complete encapsulation of LA and/or the confinement effect of PA6 matrix, both of which constrained the movement of LA molecules. It is envisioned that the electrospun ultrafine composite fibers with PCMs (e.g., fatty acids) encapsulated in the supporting polymeric matrices (e.g., PA6) would be innovative form-stable PCMs for storage and retrieval of solar thermal energy.

Abstract: We present the synthesis and characterization of a novel copolymer from benzodithiophene and alkylsulfanyl-bithiophene units, poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,4′-bis(octylsulfanyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] (PolyS). The structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties of PolyS were investigated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), NMR, UV–vis, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). PolyS was used to fabricate bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) in combination with the [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM (electron acceptors). The device realized using [70]PCBM shows a better current output due to the increased absorption of the blend film compared to the PolyS:[60]PCBM one. The power conversion efficiency of the best PSC realized is 2.3% under 100mW/cm2AM 1.5G illumination.

Abstract: We have synthesized a new narrow bandgap alternating polyfluorene copolymer (PFTTDIONE) based on 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene, 2,5-bis-(tributyl-stannyl)thiophene, and 2,6-bis-(5-bromo-3-hexyl-thiophen-2-yl)-anthraquinone (M1), via a Stille polymerization reaction. The optical properties, electrochemical properties, photovoltaic properties, hole mobility, and AFM morphology of the copolymers were investigated and discussed. The optical bandgap of PFTTDIONE is equal to the electrochemical bandgap (1.90eV). PFTTDIONE exhibits an extended absorption band in the visible part of the spectrum with an absorption edge close to 650nm. In order to investigate its photovoltaic properties, polymer solar cells (PSCs) devices based on PFTTDIONE were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ copolymer:PCBM/LiF/Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100mW/cm2. The bulk heterojuction (BHJ) polymer solar cells were fabricated with the conjugated polymer as the electron donor and 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on PFTTDIONE/PCBM (1:2) annealing at 110°C for 20min was 1.58% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74V, Fill Factor of 35.7%, and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 5.99mA/cm2.

Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) imaging is a promising characterization technique for rating and sorting of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) as-cut wafers concerning to their material quality. It is inline applicable and yields high resolution images showing recombination active defects from crystallization which influence solar cell performance. In this contribution the basic concepts in ongoing work concerning relevant defects, rating results, statistics, algorithms and general approaches for the rating are summarized. Since 2009 wafers are sorted into five quality classes at Fraunhofer ISE. Details on the rating criteria are given and three examples for application are presented: (i) the impact of edge contaminations on the solar cell results, (ii) a comparison of wafer suppliers based on random samples from a statistical basis of 10,000 wafers and (iii) the results of an advanced rating and sorting of wafers for the manufacturing of highly efficient MWT-PERC solar cells. The results confirm that PL imaging can be used for a very precise rating of material quality.

Abstract: Many different organic solar cell structures are currently being studied worldwide, but the polymer donor/acceptor heterojunction solar cell is generally considered as the most promising approach. Largest advances in device performance have been brought about by improving the intermixing of the donor and acceptor materials, which promotes charge transfer and allows for efficient charge transport via the establishment of interpenetrating networks. In this paper, the advantages, disadvantages and the approaches to resolve the problems of polymer heterojunction solar cell were simply introduced; the mechanism was illustrated including the influence of the donor/acceptor ratio and the annealing on the charge generation, collection and recombination kinetics; novel low bandgap conductive polymers with the bandgap less than 1.8eV were described in several aspects such as their design, the broadened absorption spectra; the applications of PCBM analogs, nanoscale inorganics, etc. as various highly efficient electron acceptor materials and the performance of their heterojunction solar cells were thoroughly narrated; the methods of modifying the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer consisted of using high boiling-point solvent and post-production treatments such as thermal annealing, applying electrical field and incorporating additives, which were all well expatiated; the research on the lifetime and degradation was summarized, and the enhanced stability by adding high Tg polymer was set forth; finally large-area processing and high efficiency of polymer heterojunction solar cells were expounded.

Abstract: The theoretical estimation of energy levels and energy gaps of conjugated polymers for polymer solar cells represents in principle an useful tool for an a priori screening of new donor systems. Fourteen polymers, whose energy gaps vary in the range 1.2–3.1eV have been selected and their HOMO, LUMO and gap energies have been calculated by applying Density Functional Theory methods. In spite of the variety of the examined molecular structures, nice correlations between theoretical and experimental electronic parameters were found. In particular, optical gaps and, to a lesser extent, electrochemical gap very well correlate with theoretical gaps, while for the other parameters (oxidation and reduction potentials) the general trend is reproduced. It is shown that, in general, the theoretical energies of the base repeating units have values close to the experimental energies, but the linear fittings are better when the theoretical data of much longer chains are considered: infinitely long chains must be used to predict the optical gaps, while long oligomers are more appropriate to estimate the electrochemical properties. Criteria and relationships for the prediction of energy data from theoretical ones are provided.

DNA methylation and histone modifications modulate the β1,3 galactosyltransferase β3Gal-T5 native promoter in cancer cells,

Abstract: The native promoter of β1,3 galactosyltransferase β3Gal-T5 contributes to the expression of the enzyme and its oligosaccharide products, such as Lewis antigens, in many tissues. It is mainly sensitive to nuclear factor NF-Y and located nearby two CpG islands. To elucidate the regulation of the native promoter, we analyzed NF-Y protein and β3Gal-T5 mRNA, and found that NF-Y is scarcely modulated among various cell lines and biopsies from normal or cancerous colon. Conversely, β3Gal-T5 expression levels vary in the cell lines and are strongly down-regulated in colon cancer. We also performed quantitative methylation analysis of β3Gal-T5 CpG islands and found an inverse correlation between mRNA expression and DNA methylation. In particular, the methylation levels of both islands are always increased in cancer, with respect to the corresponding normal counterpart, in matched normal and tumor samples of colon and breast origin. Moreover, treatment with chromatin remodeling agents 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine and trichostatin A does not restore transcription in completely negative cells, but only increases expression in basally positive cells. However, methylation analysis after 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine treatment revealed partial demethylation of both islands in all treated cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on β3Gal-T5 promoter showed that histone H3K4 trymethylation, H3K79 dimethylation, and H3K9-14 acetylation are high in cells expressing the transcript, and very low in those negative, while H4K20 trimethylation and H3K27 dimethylation are the opposite. We conclude that complex epigenetic modulation underlies the regulation of β3Gal-T5 native promoter.

Abstract: A new encapsulation method for organic solar cells has been tested on flexible solar modules and cells embedded in polyurethane, sandwiched between a tempered glass plate and a polycarbonate plate. Panels, each containing 10 organic solar modules/cells, were fabricated and installed for outdoor exposure in eight different countries for 4½ months. In order to minimize potential deviations in procedures and equipment, one person was responsible for the fabrication, installation and initial and final IV-measurements of the panels using the same equipment for all measurements and calibrations. The encapsulated modules/cells showed significantly reduced degradation compared with previous studies, with final average efficiencies around 40% of the original after 4½ months outdoor exposure. Photodegradation was furthermore found not to be the primary source of degradation.

Abstract: Electroless deposition of Ag nanoparticles on PECVD SiNx:H dielectric layers is a new straightforward chemical bath process well adapted to the realization of plasmonic solar cells. Depending on the stoichiometry, SiNx:H contains a certain number of Si nanoclusters embedded in the silicon nitride matrix, that act as reducing agents for Ag ions in solution and thus allows the deposition of Ag nanoparticles directly on the surface. We investigate the influence of the layer stoichiometry and deposition parameters on the nucleation and growth of Ag nanoparticles, and show how they can be adjusted to control the nanoparticle size and density. We also demonstrate that this facile metallization process can be extended to PECVD SiOx layers, another dielectric coating of interest in photovoltaics.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) have been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma. In our study, the EGFR was stimulated with EGF in human U138 glioblastoma cells. We show that the activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 pathway phosphorylated the E twenty-six (ETS)-like transcription factor 1 (Elk-1) mainly at serine 383 residue. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor, UO126 and ERK inhibitor II, FR180204 blocked the Elk-1 phosphorylation and activation. The phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was also involved in the Elk-1 activation. Activation of the Elk-1 led to an increased survival and a proliferative response with the EGF stimulation in the U138 glioblastoma cells. Knocking-down the Elk-1 using an RNA interference technique caused a decrease in survival of the unstimulated U138 glioblastoma cells and also decreased the proliferative response to the EGF stimulation. The Elk-1 transcription factor was important for the survival and proliferation of U138 glioblastoma cells upon the stimulation of EGFR with EGF. The MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways regulated this response via activation of the Elk-1 transcription factor. The Elk-1 may be one of the convergence points for pathways located downstream of EGFR in glioblastoma cells. Utilization of the Elk-1 as a therapeutic target may lead to a novel strategy in treatment of glioblastoma.

Abstract: In this work we present three novel viologen-type electrochromic compounds, which turn into red, green and blue (RGB) upon electrochemical reduction on porous titania surface. The synthesis of the three compounds involved attaching benzyl group with phosphonic acid residue as an anchor to 4,4′-bipyridine, 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridine and 4,4′,4″,4′″-thieno-2,3,4,5-tetrayltetrapyridine. The sterically demanding benzyl groups help to decrease the strong propensity of the colored radical cations to aggregation. The electrochromic derivatives were adsorbed on the surface of porous titania layers prepared by electrophoretic deposition onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass followed by mechanical compression. Finally the electrodes with the grafted electrochromic derivatives were glued to a second FTO glass to form a closed cell, which operates with two electrodes. The electrochromic windows exhibited high contrast, fast response and low current consumption (∼1mA) when relatively low voltage (∼5V) was applied.

Abstract: The 3-dimensional imaging of complete polymer solar cells prepared by roll-to-roll coating was carried out using high-resolution 1322nm optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. We found it possible to image the 3-dimensional structure of the entire solar cell that comprises UV-barrier, barrier material, adhesive, substrate and active solar cell multilayer structure. The achievable resolution was 12μm in the lateral plane and 4.5μm in the depth. We found that the OCT technique could be readily employed to identify coating defects in the functional layers. We finally identify the limitations of the technique, and future developments that would strengthen the use of the technique are described.

Abstract: Glycine receptor chloride channels are Cys-loop receptor proteins that isomerize between a low affinity closed state and a high affinity ion-conducting state. There is currently much interest in understanding the mechanisms that link affinity changes with conductance changes. This essentially involves an agonist binding in the glycine receptor ligand-binding site initiating local conformational changes that propagate in a wave towards the channel gate. However, it has proved difficult to convincingly distinguish those agonist-induced domain movements that are critical for triggering activation from those that are simply local deformations to accommodate ligands in the site. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare conformational changes in the ligand-binding site in response to activation by glycine, which binds locally, and ivermectin, which binds in the transmembrane domain. We reasoned that ivermectin-mediated activation should initiate a conformational wave that propagates from the pore-lining domain towards the ligand-binding domain, eliciting conformational changes in those extracellular domains that are allosterically linked to the gate. We found that ivermectin indeed elicited conformational changes in ligand-binding domain loops C, D and F. This implies that conformational changes in these domains are important for activation. This result also provides a mechanism to explain how ivermectin potentiates glycine-induced channel activation.

Abstract: A study on the microstructure of intrinsic, microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) layers deposited with various silane concentrations is presented. The layers were fabricated in a large-area Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) system on rough TCO-coated substrates. The microstructure was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in two different geometries. The structural properties are related to the performance of solar cells deposited together with the μc-Si:H layers. The crystalline volume fraction of the studied films ranged from highly crystalline to amorphous as derived from Raman spectroscopy and Grazing Incidence XRD. A hexagonal silicon phase, which is related to stacking faults and twins appeared in Bragg–Brentano and Grazing Incidence diffractograms, and revealed that these types of defects occur more pronounced on crystal planes that grow parallel to the sample surface. By evaluating the integrated intensity ratio of the {220} to {111} reflection of cubic silicon a small preferential orientation (texture) was observed for the high-crystalline material. Material close to the transition to amorphous phase (that leads to an optimum in solar cell performance) exhibits no preferential orientation. This shows that for the material under investigation — which is optimized for tandem solar cell with efficiencies above 12% — a preferential orientation is not a requirement to achieve device-quality material for good solar cell performance.

Abstract: Mitochondrial response of EA.hy926 endothelial cells to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was investigated. It was confirmed that TNFα stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increases intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) level. These changes were paralleled by elevated oxygen consumption, slightly raised total mitochondrial mass and increased manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) content. They also correlated with a rise of mitochondrial transcription factor 1 (TFAM), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α, which are involved in regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and an elevated level of selected respiratory chain proteins. Thus, the apparent stimulatory effect of TNFα on mitochondrial metabolism probably reflects an increased amount of mitochondria rather than activation of biochemical processes per se, although the latter cannot be excluded definitely. These observations are similar to those described for cardiac muscle cells challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in which mitochondrial biogenesis was postulated. Stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis could be a mechanism activated to prevent TNFα-induced cell death.

Abstract: Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family involved in cell-cycle regulation and cellular response to stresses. It is of great interest to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of Plk2. Here, using real-time PCR and Western blot assays, we show that trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, upregulated Plk2 mRNA and protein expression in the human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line. Luciferase activity analysis of the truncated Plk2 promoter indicated that the region from −1220 to −830 of the Plk2 promoter was sensitive to TSA. Moreover, using the electrophoresis mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we identified two GATA-1 responsive elements at positions −1051 and −949, to which GATA-1 binding was enhanced by TSA under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot showed that the levels of acetylated GATA-1 were increased with TSA in MG-63 cells, consistent with their binding affinities to the GATA-1 responsive elements. In summary, these data demonstrate that acetylation plays a crucial role in Plk2 expression and acetylation of GATA-1 by TSA treatment may upregulate their DNA-binding affinities, resulting in the activation of Plk2 promoter. These results may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of Plk2 regulation.

Abstract: Time-dependent measurements of both power conversion efficiency and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy have been observed for solar cell blends containing the polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with two different functionalized C60 electron acceptor molecules: commercially available [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid octadecyl ester (PCBOD) produced in this laboratory. Efficiency was found to decay with an exponential time dependence, while spectroscopic features show saturating exponential behavior. Time constants extracted from both types of measurements showed reasonable agreement for samples produced from the same blend. In comparison to the PCBM samples, the stability of the PCBOD blends was significantly enhanced, while both absorption and power conversion efficiency were decreased.

Abstract: Solid-phase crystallisation (SPC) of Si films on glass prepared by three deposition methods, plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), electron-beam evaporation, and a combination of both, are compared for different annealing temperatures. Three independent techniques, optical transmission microscopy, UV reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, are used to characterise the crystallisation kinetics and film properties. The activation energy for the incubation is estimated to be 2.7–3.0eV. The scanning electron microscopy images of polycrystalline Si films after Secco etching show a gradually decreasing average grain size in each film type for higher SPC temperatures. The crystal quality of all film types degrades at higher crystallisation temperatures. Solar cells fabricated from these polycrystalline Si films were characterised by Suns-Voc and spectral response measurements. According to both the resulting open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the electronic quality of all polycrystalline Si film types and the corresponding cell performance degrade for higher crystallisation temperatures but to a different extent depending on the film deposition method.

Abstract: Nanostructured nickel hydroxide thin film was prepared by cathodic electrodeposition in room temperature followed by annealing process at 250°C. The annealed nickel hydroxide thin film exhibited good lithium-driven electrochromic properties without any activation process. The as-deposited nickel hydroxide thin film was transparent while the annealed one showed brownish color. The annealed thin film could be used as counter electrode coupled with tungsten oxide thin film electrode. A complementary electrochromic device in the form of glass/FTO/WO3/Li+–PVB/NiO/FTO/glass was also demonstrated in the present study.

Abstract: Polyethylene glycol (PEG)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) core/shell nanofibers were fabricated using coaxial electrospinning. In the core/shell composite nanofibers, melted PEG and PVDF solutions were coaxially electrospun (e-spun) through a double spinneret as a core layer and as a shell layer, respectively. The PEG of the core layer in the e-spun composite nanofibers is a phase-change material (PCM) that is able to store and release large amounts of thermal energy at a constant phase transition temperature. PEG was encapsulated with a PVDF shell to prevent its leakage and reduce the effect of the external environment during usage. The core/shell structure of the e-spun composite nanofiber was confirmed using water contact angle (WCA) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the e-spun composite nanofibers had good thermal stability and energy storage capacity. PEG of three different molecular weights (MWs: 1000Da, 2000Da and 4000Da) was used as the core material to prepare e-spun composite nanofibers with different melting/crystallization temperature ranges and thermal storage capacities. Among these PEGs, the WCA value of 106° of e-spun PEG4000/PVDF core/shell nanofibers is similar to that of e-spun PVDF nanofibers confirming that the core/shell nanofibers could completely encapsulate 4000Da PEG at the highest core feed rate of 0.210mL/h. Regarding in terms of energy storage capacity, core/shell nanofibers, fabricated at the core feed rate of 0.210mL/h, had the largest content of PEG in the core up to 42.5wt% with a latent heat of 68J/g and a melting temperature of 62.8°C. These shape-stabilized core/shell nanofibers showed good thermal reliability and sufficiently high tensile strength, leading to various potential applications related to energy storage.

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films are made using sulfurisation of co-sputtered metallic and sulfur-containing precursor films. The CZTS grain size is larger for metallic precursors than for sulfur-containing precursors while more uniform films with fewer voids are obtained in the latter case. During sulfurisation of precursors with tin-excess in closed quartz ampoules, tin is lost from the films with greater losses from metallic precursors. We suggest that the reduced grain size and the reduced tin-loss for sulfur-containing precursors can be explained by a larger number of CZTS nuclei being formed early in the sulfurisation process. In sulfur containing precursors with large tin excess, SnS2 is observed together with CZTS, and a tin-rich bottom layer segregates. This indicates that tin-diffusion in CZTS is relatively slow. Solar cell devices made for a range of compositions at and around stoichiometric CZTS show highest efficiencies in two compositional groups; Zn-rich and Cu-poor/Sn-rich, while close to stoichiometric material gives poor devices. Devices including the tin-rich bottom layer show efficiencies of up to 3.2%. The role of secondary phases such as ZnS and SnS2 on device performance is discussed.

Abstract: Degradation process of the organic solar cells (OSCs) with Al and LiF/Al cathodes was studied using time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) depth profile analysis and the lifetime of OSCs was improved using a bilayer cathode of organic interlayer/Al. The dissociation of LiF and diffusion of the Li were critical to the degradation of the organic solar cells with LiF/Al cathode and induced the significant reduction of open circuit voltage, short circuit current and power conversion efficiency during lifetime test. The degradation process was suppressed in the organic solar cells with organic interlayer/Al bilayer cathode, resulting in improved lifetime in organic solar cells.

Abstract: The imprinting of random square based pyramidal textures with micrometric scale at the air/glass interface of thin film silicon solar cells is presented as an efficient alternative to anti-reflective coatings to minimize reflection losses at the cell entrance. This novel processing step, which can be applied after cell or module manufacture, is found to simultaneously enhance light in-coupling and light-trapping in amorphous silicon/microcrystalline silicon tandem solar cells. A remarkable total current gain of more than 5% is demonstrated with the imprinting of such structures, resulting in a tandem cell with a high initial efficiency of 13% for a total absorber layer thickness below 1.5μm.

Abstract: High-chain fatty acid esters of higher alcohols have recently been investigated as novel organic phase change materials (PCM) for thermal energy storage. A series of high-chain fatty acid esters of 1-hexadecanol (cetyl alcohol) were prepared through esterification reaction between 1-hexadecanol and C10–C20 fatty acids with even carbon number in the absence of catalyst and under vacuum. FT-IR spectrometer, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) were intensively used for chemical and thermal analyses. Phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp), thermal decomposition and reliability after 1000 thermal cycles were obtained with necessary statistical data to clarify the thermal properties of the materials. The DSC analyses indicated that the melting temperatures of the high-chain fatty acid esters of cetyl alcohol were between 29oC and 60oC with phase change enthalpy above 185kJ/kg. The results showed that these materials were favorable for low temperature heat transfer applications with superior thermal properties and reliability.

Abstract: The performance of a desiccant-filled polyisobutylene edge sealant for organic electronics is reported. The sealant was applied through a low temperature lamination process using glass substrates and various seal widths. The performance was tested using the Ca corrosion method at 50°C and 80% relative humidity (RH). Data show an effective water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), on the order of 10−3g/m2/day in the transient regime with a breakthrough time greater than 1400h for seals 1.5mm wide and 0.3mm thick. By changing the sealant architecture, the breakthrough time was increased with similar effective WVTRs. Finally, the sealant was applied to organic electrochromic devices, which displayed a retention of performance after 1000h of storage at 50°C and 80% RH.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss in the elderly, which starts from aging processes of retinal pigment epithelial cells. Among variable risk factors in occurrence and progression of age-related macular degeneration, oxidized low density lipoprotein could be causally involved in pathobiological changes of RPE cells. Herein we showed that oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced senescence of retinal pigment epithelial cells is followed by outer blood–retinal barrier dysfunction. Under sub-lethal concentration, oxidized low density lipoprotein could promote advanced senescence of retinal pigment epithelial cells. Interestingly expression of CRALBP and RPE 65, indicators of retinal pigment epithelial cell differentiation, was decreased by oxidized low density lipoprotein. In addition, oxidized low density lipoprotein induced reactive oxygen species production and up-regulated inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α and vascular endothelial growth factor, when β-catenin, a critical mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway, was also elevated. Oxidized low density lipoprotein increased paracellular permeability of retinal pigment epithelial cells, when zonula occludens-1 at intercellular junctions markedly decreased as well. Furthermore, in retinal pigment epithelial cells and choriocapillaris of human apolipoprotein E2 transgenic mouse eye, increased vascular endothelial growth factor and decreased zonula occludens-1 expression was observed. Therefore, our results suggest that oxidized low density lipoprotein could promote senescence of retinal pigment epithelial cells which leads to induce outer blood–retinal barrier dysfunction as an early pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.

Abstract: Nickel oxide (NiO) was thermally evaporated between the active layer and the top anode in inverted polymer solar cells. We demonstrate that NiO behaves as an anode buffer layer. The NiO thin film can module the Schottky barrier and form an ohmic contact at the organic/metal interface, which make it a great holes transport layer. The device performance with NiO of different thicknesses are investigated and compared. The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases by fivefold with 2nm NiO compared to the control cell without NiO. The optimum device performance with 2nm NiO shows the Jsc of 7.92mA/cm2, Voc of 0.46V, FF of 39.8%, and thus the PCE of 1.45% under AM1.5G illumination of 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: The membrane associated MMP, MT1-MMP, is a critical pericellular protease involved in tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis and is highly up-regulated in numerous human cancers. It therefore represents an exciting new therapeutic cancer-specific target. We have generated recombinant human scFv antibodies against the non-catalytic, hemopexin domain of MT1-MMP that modulate its interactions with collagen. One of these is an effective inhibitor of the invasive capacity of cancer cells and of angiogenesis in model systems. This demonstrates that targeting sites outside the catalytic domain presents a potential novel approach to proteinase inhibition that could have applications in cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: A novel procedure based on the reactive evaporation method was developed to deposit highly transparent thin films of i-ZnO and n+-ZnO in-situ. The opto-electrical properties of the ZnO films were optimized for using them as TCO layer in solar cells. The optimization of the preparation parameters was achieved through a figure of merit defined in terms of both, the transmittance and the resistivity. n+-ZnO films with resistivities around 8×10−4Ωcm and i-ZnO films with resistivities around 105Ωcm and transmittances greater than 80% (in the visible region) were obtained with this method. The applicability of the i-ZnO and n+-ZnO thin films in photovoltaic devices has been demonstrated by using them as interdiffusion barrier and TCO layer in CuInS2 based solar cells. Conversion efficiencies of 9.1% were achieved with CIS based solar cells using ZnO thin films deposited by reactive evaporation.

Abstract: As the search for marketable photovoltaic solar cells continues, organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells have been identified as a technology with many attractive features for commercialization. Most photovoltaic technologies on the market today were improved in the consumer electronics market segment. A similar evolution has been envisioned for OPV. Hence this paper investigates consumer preferences for solar cells directly powering consumer electronics. Choice experiments were designed and responses were collected using a random sample of 300 individuals from the Flemish region (northern part of Belgium). Results allow for computation of attribute importance, willingness to pay (WTP), and simulation of theoretical market share. These measures point towards OPV being able to reach considerable market share in the long run, bearing in mind that efforts are first needed in elevating OPV's efficiency and lifetime as they most determine consumers' preferences. Price is found to be the least important product characteristic for OPV solar cells to be incorporated in consumer electronics devices. We therefore warn against generalizing attributes’ importance across the boundaries of market segments.

Abstract: This study presents a one-dimensional mathematical model for simulating the transient processes of sheet and tube type photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) system and conventional type solar collectors. The models are based on the energy conservation for the glass cover, PV plate, absorber plate, tube, water in the tube and storage tank for the PV/T and the same layers excluding PV plate in conventional solar collector. The models were all first order ordinary differential equations which could be easily solved in the Matlab computer program using ode solvers. For the purpose of validating the proposed methods, performance tests were done on the both systems. Satisfactory convergences were found between the measured data and calculated results. The statistical analysis was performed for the scientific validation of the results. The current model is suitable for the single cover tube type PV/T systems.

Abstract: The role of the window layer in Cd1−xZnxS/CdTe photovoltaic (PV) device structures was investigated using a triple wavelength laser beam induced current (LBIC) technique. Full pn structures were deposited using metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The triple wavelength LBIC technique allowed for the diagnostic analysis of carrier collection uniformity at 3 wavelength dependent photon penetration depths, δp. An assessment of the Cd1−xZnxS window layer film thickness and surface coverage showed a correlation between lateral device performance and window layer thickness distribution. Islands of thick Cd1−xZnxS were shown to increase localised blue absorption, correlating to isolated regions of increased red and IR photoresponse. Overall device open-circuit voltage, Voc is shown to demonstrate a linear dependence on thick (∼300nm) Cd1−xZnxS surface coverage. Voc and shunt resistance Rsh losses attributed to the window layer were found to jointly contribute to the overall cell efficiency losses. A non-uniform pin-hole distribution, leading to Rsh loss, was found to be independent of the overall Cd1−xZnxS thickness distribution; thus the triple wavelength LBIC measurement was able to identify causes for the observed losses in both Voc and Rsh.

Abstract: A simple and low cost thin film solution processing system comprising a single roll coating machine has been developed to allow direct investigation of variable parameter effects in roll-to-roll processing. We present roll coating of the active layers in polymer solar cells and validate the instrument by reinvestigating the well known effect of solvent on performance. We obtained a maximum power conversion efficiency of 1.6% for the reference cells, which compares well with reported roll-to-roll coated cells according to ProcessOne, with a relative deviation caused by solvent type nearing 40% on roll coated cells, confirming the solvent to have a significant influence on the performance of the finished cell. We further present a slot-die coating head with an ultra low dead volume allowing for the preparation of roll coated polymer solar cells on flexible substrates with nearly no loss of solution, enabling roll coating testing of new polymers where only small amounts are often available. We demonstrate the formation of >50 solar cells (each with an active area of 1cm2) with printed metal back electrodes using as little as 0.1mL of active layer solution. This approach outperforms spin coating with respect to temperature control, ink usage, speed and is directly compatible with industrial processing and upscaling.

Abstract: A series of diacid dioctadecyl esters (DADOEs) were synthesized as novel solid–liquid phase change materials (PCMs) by esterification of octadecanol and ethane diacid, butane diacid, adipic acid, octane diacid and sebacic acid and then, ultrafine phase change fibers of DADOE/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were fabricated via electrospinning as form stable PCMs. It is found that the DADOE/PET composite fibers have good morphology with smooth surface when DADOE content is lower than 50% (w/w, with respect to PET matrix), and the average fiber diameter increases gradually with the increase of DADOE content from 375nm (pure PET fibers) to more than 1μm. The fiber morphology has no obvious variation after thermal cycles, which confirms that DADOE/PET fibers have the characteristic of form stable phase change. The results from DSC curves show that DADOE/PET fibers impart reversible phase change behaviors similar to those of DADOEs, and the enthalpies of the composite fibers increase with the increase of DADOE content (the highest enthalpy of melting for the fibers is more than 65J/g). In addition, the thermal performances of the composite fibers could be well maintained after thermal cycles, which indicates that the fibers have good thermal stability and reliability.

Abstract: This paper reports the effects of interfacial modification on the performance of the inverted hybrid solar cells consisting of P3HT as an electron donor and CdS nanoporous film as an electron acceptor. The device performance can be enhanced by grafting N719 dye molecules onto the surface of CdS. By optimizing the P3HT thickness, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CdS/N719/P3HT hybrid solar cell is increased to 1.06% from 0.06% of the CdS/P3HT hybrid solar cell, with a champion device efficiency of 1.31% under AM1.5G of 100mW/cm2 intensity. It is revealed that the interface modification by N719 dye can promote exciton dissociation between the two components, reduce interfacial charge recombination, and form a dipole layer at the interface that modulated the interface energy level, which enhances the open circuit voltage and short circuit current coinstantaneously. This work may provide a general method to achieve high performance organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells by interfacial modification.

Abstract: Fibrosis of the lungs and other organs is characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts, effectors of wound-repair that are responsible for the deposition and organization of new extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to tissue injury. During the resolution phase of normal wound repair, myofibroblast apoptosis limits the continued deposition of ECM. Mounting evidence suggests that myofibroblasts from fibrotic wounds acquire resistance to apoptosis, but the mechanisms regulating this resistance have not been fully elucidated. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a soluble peptide strongly associated with fibrogenesis, decreases myofibroblast susceptibility to apoptosis through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase (PI3K)/AKT. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also promotes myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis through PI3K/AKT-dependent and -independent mechanisms, although the role of FAK in ET-1 mediated resistance to apoptosis has not been explored. The goal of this study was to investigate whether FAK contributes to ET-1 mediated myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis and to examine potential mechanisms downstream of FAK and PI3K/AKT by which ET-1 regulates myofibroblast survival. Here, we show that ET-1 regulates myofibroblast survival by Rho/ROCK-dependent activation of FAK. The anti-apoptotic actions of FAK are, in turn, dependent on activation of PI3K/AKT and the subsequent increased expression of Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Collectively, these studies define a novel mechanism by which ET-1 promotes myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis through upregulation of Survivin.

Abstract: The performance of micromorph silicon tandem solar cells deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 40MHz was investigated in a large area industrially employed reactor as a function of the crystalline fraction of the microcrystalline bottom cell. The relevant plasma parameters frequency, pressure, hydrogen and silane mixture, temperature were kept constant. The RF-power for the deposition of the bottom cell was varied in order to scan its Raman crystalline fraction over the transition region from amorphous into highly crystalline. Assuming constant amorphous or microcrystalline material quality (in terms of stability and defect density) the optimum value of the Raman crystalline fraction and especially the width of the optimum range was thus determined quantitatively. It is shown that the optimum Raman crystalline fraction of the bottom cell on substrates with front contact and amorphous top cell is 52%±10%. A clear decrease of short circuit current density is observed for too high crystalline fraction.

Abstract: Our previous study demonstrated that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) plays an important role in the proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). In the present study, we examined whether PEDF inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated HASMC migration and proliferation. PEDF dose-dependently reduced PDGF-induced HASMC migration and proliferation in vitro and also arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase, and this was associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4, and p21Cip1 and increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. The antiproliferative and antimigratory effects of PEDF were partially blocked by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662, but not by the PPARα antagonist MK886. In in vivo studies, the femoral artery of C57BL/6 mice was endothelial-denuded and the mice injected intravenously with PEDF or vehicle. After 2 weeks, both the neointima/media area ratio and cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells) in the neointima were significantly reduced and again these effects were partially reversed by GW9662 pretreatment. Our data show that PEDF increases PPARγ activation, preventing entry of HASMCs into the cell cycle in vitro and reducing the neointimal area and cell proliferation in the neointima in vivo. Thus, PEDF may represent a safe and effective novel target for the prevention and treatment of vascular proliferative diseases.

Abstract: The identification of heterozygous mutations (with an incidence up to 85%) in either the R132 residue of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) or the R172 residue of IDH2 in human low-grade diffuse gliomas was remarkable because no oncogenic pathway had been previously documented correlated with these enzymes. In spite of a recent surge in elucidating the tumorigenic activity of IDH mutations in glioblastoma, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We showed here that C6 glioma cells transiently over-expressing IDH2R172G induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, up-regulation of HIF-1α signaling and corresponding proteins expression that were closely related with tumor invasion and chemo-resistance. These results demonstrated a functional model in which IDH mutations were closely interrelated with glioma progression and could hold some therapeutic implications for future human glioma treatment.

Abstract: In our previous studies, ZKSCAN3 was demonstrated to be over-expressed in invasive colonic tumor cells and their liver metastases, but minimally expressed in adjacent non-transformed tissues. Further preliminary data showed that ZKSCAN3 was expressed in a majority of prostate cancer patient samples, but not in normal prostate tissues. Moreover, the ZKSCAN3 protein is highly expressed in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, which has high metastatic potential, but little expression was observed in non-metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Thus, we hypothesized that ZKSCAN3 could participate in tumor metastasis by regulating tumor cell migration. To test this hypothesis, ZKSCAN3 mRNA was knocked down by ZKSCAN3 specific shRNA in PC3 cells and a significant decrease in cell motility was observed. In contrast, when ZKSCAN3 cDNA was overexpressed in PC3 cells, cell detachment was observed and suspension culture induced apoptosis was greatly decreased, suggesting that ZKSCAN3 is able to enhance PC3 cell survival under anoikis stress. Additional wound healing and invasion assays showed that cell migration was enhanced by ZKSCAN3 expression. Interestingly, the ZKSCAN3 gene was amplified in 26% (5/19) of metastatic prostate cancers and 20% (1/5) of lymph node metastases, but there was no amplification found in primary prostate cancers, further supporting the role of ZKSCAN3 in tumor cell migration. In vivo studies using orthotopic tumor models indicated that overexpression of ZKSCAN3 significantly enhanced tumorigenicity. Taken together, we provide evidence that ZKSCAN3, a zinc finger transcription factor, plays a critical role in promoting prostate cancer cell migration.

Abstract: Our laboratory has proved that 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a product of arachidonic acid catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), plays a pivotal role in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the mechanisms of how hypoxia regulates 15-LO expression are still unclear. As the formation of endogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis, was promoted by hypoxia, we suspect whether hypoxia-induced the expression of 15-LO is via the TGF-β1 pathway. We found that treatment of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with TGF-β1 significantly increased the expression of 15-LO and levels of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, product of 15-LO, which were inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGFβRI) inhibitor, SD-208 and siRNA targeted to knockdown rat TGFβRI. Moreover, our results showed that TGF-β1 regulated the cell cycle progression and made more cells from the G0/G1 phase to the G2/M+S phase and enhanced the microtubule formation in cell nucleus. Additionally, we found that the 15-LO pathway was involved in TGFβ-1-mediated cell viability, DNA synthesis and the cell cycle progression. Our data provide novel evidence that hypoxia induced 15-LO expression is through TGF-β1, and 15-LO pathway plays a critical role in TGFβRI mediated the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells induced by hypoxia. Thus, new strategies aimed at combined blockade of TGFβRI as well as 15-LO may yield optimal therapeutic benefits.

Abstract: ITO-free organic solar cells with ink-jet printed current collecting grids and high conducting PEDOT:PSS as a composite anode are demonstrated. Inkjet printed current collecting grids with different cross-sectional areas have been investigated. The effect of the width and height of the grid lines and busbars has been measured and modeled by direct current (DC) simulations. The electrical potential in devices with different grid profiles have been calculated and reveal critical bottlenecks in the grid electrode geometry, as the ability of the busbar to collect all the current. Experimentally, the upper limit of the conductivity of the ink-jet printed current collecting grids is limited by the topology of the grids and shadow losses in the solar cells.

Abstract: We fabricate ITO-free bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the structure glass/WO3/Ag/WO3/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al. According to the J–V characterization, the device efficiency is improved by 27.4% for the ITO-free device with a 70nm-thick active layer but reduced by 19.9% for the device with a 150nm-thick active layer, when compared with that of the PSC device with an ITO transparent electrode. Further investigation based on IPCE spectra test and transfer matrix simulations reveals that it is the optical resonance effect of the metal-mirror-microcavity (MMC) constructed between the semitransparent Ag electrode and top Al electrode that leads to the efficiency improvement for the device with 70nm-thick active layer. Meanwhile, the efficiency reduction of the device with a 150nm-thick active layer is caused by the off-resonance suppression of the MMC structure. It demonstrates that the MMC structure is an important element to be considered when the WO3/Ag/WO3 multilayer is used to substitute the ITO electrode as a transparent electrode of the PSC devices.

Abstract: In this paper we analyse the capabilities and limitations of single layer index matching coatings for the glass/TCO or TCO/absorber interfaces in thin film solar cells. Optical models are used to evaluate the potential gain in cell efficiencies with hypothetical ideal matching materials to minimise losses due to reflections at internal interfaces. We suggest the range of desired optical properties of such materials, where a net gain in cell efficiency can be achieved, and discuss the commercial benefits of such intermediate matching layer. For some selected ternary and quaternary novel oxides available, the potential efficiency gain due to the inclusion of an anti-reflective matching layer in a solar cell structure is calculated and compared with the case of ideal matching materials.

Abstract: Exposed asphalt shingles undergo chemical and physical changes as they weather. Here we focus on the resulting changes in solar reflectance. Most roofing granules employing inorganic metal oxide pigments are very stable. Initial reflectance changes are therefore due to changes in the asphalt itself, and the loss of processing oils coating the granules. Ultraviolet-induced photo-oxidation of these oils and exposed asphalt produces dark hydrophilic substances that are removed by rain, or in dry climates, transported by dew. After six months, changes in solar reflectance are small and (in California) mainly due an annual cycle of accumulation of atmospheric dust and its removal by rain. In hot humid climates cyanobacteria grow rapidly on granule surfaces, creating dark stains that reduce reflectance by as much as 0.06 at 3 years. We show that in these types of climates (exemplified by Houston) biocide additives such as Cu2O can be employed to maintain solar reflectance. When cyanobacteria are absent, solar reflectance changes over the first three years are on the order of 0.02 or less, and may be either positive or negative.

Abstract: New unsymmetrical low band-gap push–pull squaraine chromophores, [TPA-bisHT-HP]-X-Ind [X: SQ, diCNSQ], which are composed of triphenylamine electron donating, π-conjugated dithiophene-pyrrole bridging, and squaraine-indol electron withdrawing moieties, for their application in solution processed BHJ solar cell. The [TPA-bisHT-HP]-diCNSQ-Ind having the stronger electron withdrawing moiety exhibits significantly the red-shifted absorption spectrum due to its strong intramolecular charge transfer in solution as well as in solid-state. The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices fabricated with [TPA-bisHT-HP]-diCNSQ-Ind/C71-PCBM film exhibited a PCE of 2.05% (±0.07) with short-circuit current (Jsc)=9.05mA/cm2, fill factor (FF)=0.33, and open-circuit voltage (Voc)=0.69V, which is ∼3 times higher efficiency compared to [TPA-bisHT-HP]-SQ-Ind/C71-PCBM BHJ films.

Abstract: In this paper we measure, spatially resolved, the efficiency potential of multicrystalline material. The excess carrier lifetime in the bulk affects the open-circuit voltage, the short-circuit current and the fill factor of a solar cell differently as different injection conditions apply. Therefore, we measure the bulk lifetime injection-dependent and analyze each IV-parameter separately. Furthermore, multicrystalline wafers with laterally varying bulk recombination need a spatially resolved analysis to explore the impact of large grains or dislocation clusters on the efficiency. The crucial information we need is the spatially resolved injection-dependent bulk lifetime. For this purpose, we use lifetime calibrated photoluminescence imaging with a varying generation rate. Measuring a surface passivated wafer after the important high temperature steps of a solar cell process ensures that we attain the bulk recombination that is relevant for the solar cell. Combining this information with a cell simulation, we deduce the maximum efficiency for every image point. We also discuss how to obtain global values from these images and investigate the effect of charge currents flowing laterally through the emitter using Sentaurus Device and Spice network simulations. A comparison of these simulated global values to measured IV-parameters on finished solar cells shows good agreement between the two. A detailed analysis of two mc-wafers from different feedstock shows limiting IV-parameters in different regions, efficiency reductions due to dislocations and explains differences in the fill factor of two equally processed solar cells. The analysis shows that evaluating the material related efficiency limitation of silicon wafers has to be done at the efficiency level, as the lifetime at one generation level alone is not sufficient.

Abstract: In this work, a novel type of substrate for thin-film silicon solar cells is studied. The substrate has the advantage of being physically flat to allow the growth of cells with excellent material quality while being optically rough for enhanced light trapping that leads to high short-circuit current density. The substrate is made of rough zinc oxide (ZnO) which is grown on a flat silver reflector. The ZnO is then covered with amorphous silicon and the stack is polished to expose the tips of the pyramidal ZnO surface. The ZnO embedded in the amorphous matrix provides the desirable scattering of light while the surface onto which the cell is deposited is flat and allows for the growth of good-quality material. We present results of ∼4μm thick microcrystalline silicon solar cells prepared on such substrates with high open-circuit voltages of 520mV. We also demonstrate a large relative efficiency gain of 10% compared to a state-of-the-art cell which is grown directly on an optimized textured substrate.

Abstract: We have developed semi-transparent n–i–p organic solar cells (OSC) with free-standing multi-wall carbon nanotube (f-CNT) sheets as transparent top electrodes. By a simple and damage-free room temperature orthogonal liquid solution assisted self-laminating process, f-CNT top electrodes are successfully deposited on top of ZnPc:C60 bulk heterojunction small molecule OSCs. The cells show high fill factors above 58% as well as efficiencies up to 1.5% and greater long-term stability compared to the device having a metal electrode. For the given cell structure with f-CNT semi-transparent electrodes, the influence of an optical spacer on light absorption is studied by a systematic variation of the hole transport layer thickness, supported by optical simulations. The results strongly indicate that OSCs with f-CNT top electrodes and optimized thin film stack are highly promising for semi-transparent OSCs, which can be used in tandem devices, in tinted smart windows, and similar applications by a simple and damage-free process in roll-to-roll configuration that can be scaled to large area manufacturing.

Abstract: ZnO bilayer films were deposited by a low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition technique in a single process step, by doping with boron only the nucleation stage of the growth. The resulting 2μm thick layers are characterized by low free carrier absorption and electron mobilities over 40cm2/Vs. They therefore combine high transparency in the infrared region and moderate sheet resistances of 30Ω/sq. It is thought that the controlled introduction of boron in the early nucleation stage enables its diffusion through the layer, resulting in a very efficient reduction of the sheet resistance compared to samples deposited without doping, while preserving a strong light-scattering interface. These properties make ZnO bilayers ideal electrodes for the development of micromorph thin-film solar cells with enhanced photo-generated current.

Abstract: In the photovoltaic industry contacts to crystalline silicon are typically formed by firing of screen-printed metallization pastes. However, the stability of surface passivation layers during high temperature contact formation is a major challenge. Here, we investigate the thermal stability of the surface passivation by amorphous silicon nitride double layers (SiNy/SiNx). The SiNy passivation layer is silicon rich with refractive index larger than 3. Whereas the SiNx capping layer has a refractive index of 2.05. Compared to pure hydrogenated amorphous silicon, the nitrogen in the SiNy passivation layer improves the firing stability. We achieve an effective surface recombination velocity after a conventional co-firing process of (5.2±2)cm/s on p-type (1.5Ωcm) FZ-silicon wafers at an injection density of 1015cm−3. An analysis of the improved firing stability is presented based on FTIR and hydrogen effusion measurements. The incorporation of an SiNy/SiNx stack into the passivated rear of Cz silicon screen-printed solar cells results in an energy conversion efficiency of 18.3% compared to reference solar cells with conventional aluminum back surface field showing 17.9% efficiency. The short circuit current density increases by up to 0.8mA/cm2 compared to conventional solar cells due to the improved optical reflectance and rear side surface passivation.

Abstract: The remethylation of homocyteine into methionine is catalyzed either by methionine synthase (MTR) or by betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), in the liver. Choline/betaine deficiency and impaired BHMT pathway have been associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis, in animal models. The molecular mechanisms that impair the BHMT pathway are unknown. We aimed to investigate BHMT, BHMT2, and MTR expression in HepG2 cells and human hepatocarcinoma tissues. Transcripts were quantified by RT-qPCR and splicing was assessed by analysis of exon junctions and sequencing of variants. Protein expression was studied by Western Blot, immunohistochemistry and enzyme activity. Tumor tissue was compared with surrounding healthy tissue. RT-qPCR of HepG2 cells and of tumor samples showed a strong decrease of transcripts of BHMT and BHMT2, compared to normal. MTR transcript levels were not different. The decreased BHMT expression resulted from the transcription of a splicing variant that produced a frameshift in exon 4, with a premature termination codon in exon 5 and a loss of function of the gene. This splicing variant did not fit with any mechanism resulting from known splicing consensus sequences and was not detected in normal adult and fetal liver. Consistently, BHMT activity was abolished in HepG2 and protein expression was not detectable in HepG2 and in 5 of the 6 tumor samples, compared to normal tissues. In conclusion, a transcription variant of exon 4 produces a loss of function of BHMT in human hepatocarcinoma. Whether this abnormal transcription of BHMT is part or consequence of liver carcinogenesis should deserve further investigations.

Abstract: Osteoclasts, bone-specialized multinucleated cells, are responsible for bone destructive diseases such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Natural plant-derived products have received substantial attention given their potential therapeutic and preventive activities against human diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural flavonoid isolated from licorice, on receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced in vitro osteoclastogenesis and inflammation-mediated bone destruction in vivo. We observed that ISL dose-dependently inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation from RAW 264.7 and primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), as well as decreased the extent of lacunar resorption. Specifically, ISL targeted RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and F-actin rings formation at an early stage. The RANKL-stimulated mRNA expression of osteoclast-related genes and transcription factors were also diminished by ISL. Mechanistically, ISL blocked the RANKL-triggered RANK–TRAF6 association, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation and degradation, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 nuclear translocation, as well as activator protein (AP)-1 activation. ISL almost abrogated the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) expression and inhibited its nuclear translocation specifically in pre-osteoclasts. Furthermore, the ectopic introduction of NFATc1 into osteoclast precursors almost reversed the ISL-elicited anti-osteoclastogenic effects. Consistent with the in vitro results, administration of ISL prevented inflammatory bone loss in mice by attenuating osteoclast activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ISL suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone loss via RANK–TRAF6, MAPK, IκBα/NF-κB, and AP-1 signaling pathways. Therefore, ISL may be considered as a novel therapeutic and/or preventive strategy against lytic bone diseases.

Abstract: We discuss an alternative route to determine the solubility parameters of two prototype organic semiconductors, namely the semi-crystalline polymer poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and the methano-fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The HSP (Hansen solubility Parameters) derived by this novel method are compared to the findings derived from the classical multi-solvent method to determine the HSP, and significantly higher accuracy is found. For this novel approach we designed two component solvent blend systems, being composed by mixing a solvent with a non-solvent. Varying the composition of the solvent – non-solvent blends from 0% to 100% gradually converts a solvent into a non-solvent. This very accurate control of the dispersive, polar and hydrogen contributions to the overall solubility now allows determining the Hansen sphere for P3HT and PCBM with much higher accuracy. The transition from a solvent into a non-solvent was further followed by solar cell investigations. Comparing the solubility studies with device investigations allows identifying the processing limits of solvent systems.

Abstract: We propose a study of electrical properties of plastic solar modules with a combination of current density–voltage curves (J–V characteristics) and a non destructive Light/Laser Beam Induced Current (LBIC) technique. We first extract global electrical information and trends of modules provided by J–V curves after a warming up time and during a short illumination time. On the other hand, LBIC profiles and mappings are recorded and show the behavior of each individual cell of the module. The results allow us to identify the evolution and global trends of the module efficiency as a function of the evolution of each cell comprising the module according to a simple simulation model. At the same time, using LBIC mappings, we check the module uniformity and show that no microscopic defects coming from the deposition process of the films are visible. Finally, we reveal a module encapsulation failure.

Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder occurring predominantly in the elderly population. Its occurence in the pediatric age group is even more rare. We report a 13-year-old girl who presented with isolated cerebral venous thrombosis and was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia. Family screening for any thrombocytosis was 20 negative. With no secondary cause apparent for persistent thrombocytosis, we looked for the JAK2 mutation, but the result was negative. In contrast to linkage of JAK2 mutation positivity with increased thrombotic risk, our case showed that thrombosis can occur in the absence of JAK2 mutation in a case of essential thrombocythaemia. The indications for treatment and the best treatment of children with ET are currently not known, and guidelines for the management of children with ET are needed. Adult patients have near-normal life expectancy because of the low rate of leukemic conversion, but no child has been monitored long enough to assess prognosis.

Abstract: Compositional uniformity of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells was studied, using thin cross sections of complete cells prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) and examined in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). This methodology revealed the compositional variations at the nm-scale. The Ga and In compositions vary not only between neighboring grains, but also inside individual single crystal grains along their growth direction, which explains the electrical non-uniformity seen in electron beam-induced current (EBIC) measurements.

Abstract: Stability is an essential issue in polymer solar cells for achieving commercially applicable devices. In this work, we report on a highly stable polymer solar cell, based on an inverted structure with the active layer sandwiched between a pair of metal-oxide buffer layers and an inherently air-stable conjugated polymer, a-PTPTBT. After interface modification, the unencapsulated device can retain power conversion efficiency without apparent degradation even after six months of storage in ambient conditions. This device's excellent stability is attributed to the air-stable and chemically stable conjugated polymer, as well as the environmentally robust metal oxides used as the interfacial layers. To further improve the device performance, cathode-side interface modification was also carried out. After the insertion of the TiO2 nanorod interlayer between the ZnO thin film and the active layer, the device efficiency can be successfully increased from 3.3% to 4.1%. The future application of this materials system in inverted structures needs efforts devoted to morphology control and interface engineering to improve the device fill factor. The methodology applied here can serve as an effective strategy for fabricating highly air-stable devices with different materials systems.

Abstract: Adiponectin (Acrp30) shows several beneficial properties and circulates as different oligomers. The role of Acrp30 in lung is not fully clear, but a link with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been highlighted. In this study, we analyzed the anthropometrical and biochemical features and evaluated total Acrp30 levels of a COPD cohort without metabolic complications compared to healthy controls. In addition, being the oligomerization state critical for its biological activities, we characterized the pattern of Acrp30 circulating oligomers focusing on the high molecular weight (HMW) oligomers to verify whether it correlates to COPD. Finally, we investigated AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression in lung from COPD. Interestingly, we found for the first time that the oligomerization state of Acrp30 is altered in COPD; particularly, we observed that the higher levels of Acrp30 are associated with a significant and specific increase of HMW. In addition, we demonstrated the presence of AdipoRs with a lower expression of AdipoR2 compared to AdipoR1. In conclusion, we demonstrated that in COPD, the higher levels of Acrp30 are associated with the significantly increase of HMW representing the most biologically active forms. The important role of Acrp30 in pathophysiological conditions of lung is supported also by the modulation of AdipoRs with the down regulation of AdipoR2. The low expression of AdipoR2 could suggest a specific role of this receptor, mainly implicated in Acrp30 effects on inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, total Acrp30, HMW and its receptors could be considered critical targets to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for lung diseases.

Four-and-a-half-LIM protein 1 down-regulates estrogen receptor α activity through repression of AKT phosphorylation in human breast cancer cell,

Abstract: The Four-and-a-half LIM protein 1 (FHL-1) is a member of LIM-only protein family. It plays important roles in proliferation and apoptosis regulation of certain hepatocellular carcinoma and human breast cancer. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is involved in the development and progression of human breast cancer. IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway also plays certain roles in the program and regulation of human breast cancer and ovary cancer. However, the biological function of FHL-1 in regulation of human breast cancer and in the cross-talk of estrogen and IGF signaling pathway remains largely unknown. In this paper, we show that FHL-1 protein interacts with ERα and AKT. FHL-1 represses the translation and transcription of estrogen receptor-responsive genes through down-regulating AKT activation. In addition, FHL-1 is not only an ERα-interacting co-regulation protein, but also decreases the phosphorylation of AKT and ERα. Depression of endogenous FHL-1 by FHL-1 targeted small interfering RNA enhances the expression of these proteins and phosphorylation of AKT and ERα. These data suggest that FHL-1 may regulate ER signaling function through regulation of AKT activation besides the physical and functional interaction with ERα. By establishing a linkage role of the FHL-1 between the estrogen ERα signaling pathway and IGF/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, this study identifies that FHL-1 proteins may be a useful molecular target for human breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: We present a comb-shaped photonic-crystal (PhC) rods-lattice structure of broadband light diffraction and funnelling for solar cell applications. It is shown that the photonic band of this PhC structure is very dispersive over a broad bandwidth so that light will be efficiently diffracted in the wavelength region of solar radiation. The PhC structure also creates resonance modes leading to further diffraction and funnelling of light so that the light propagates in many pathways in the whole PhC lattice region, which will greatly facilitate light–matter interaction when light-absorbing elements are embedded in the PhC structure. The proposed structure is also valid for photodetection applications.

Abstract: Ion conductivity and optical properties were investigated for polymer electrolytes based on poly (ethyleneimine) and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and also containing up to 9wt.% of 7-nm-diameter SiO2 nanoparticles. The [N]:[Li] molar ratio was kept constant at 50:1. Impedance measurements were performed in the frequency range 10−2–107Hz and between the temperatures 20 and 70°C with an applied ac voltage of 1V. Spectrophotometric data of total and diffuse transmittance were taken between the wavelengths 300 and 2500nm. The bulk impedance was fitted to a conductive Havriliak-Negami circuit model. The ion conductivity increased monotonically for increasing SiO2 contents; specifically its room temperature value went from 8.5×10–7S/cm without nanoparticles to 3.8×10–5S/cm for 8wt.% of SiO2 while the diffuse transmittance remained at ∼1% so that optical clarity prevailed.

Non-muscle myosin IIA transports a Golgi glycosyltransferase to the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to its cytoplasmic tail,

Abstract: The mechanism of the Golgi-to-ER transport of Golgi glycosyltransferases is not clear. We utilize a cell line expressing the core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-M (C2GnT-M) tagged with c-Myc to explore this mechanism. By immunoprecipitation using anti-c-Myc antibodies coupled with proteomics analysis, we have identified several proteins including non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), heat shock protein (HSP)-70 and ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 in the immunoprecipitate. Employing yeast-two-hybrid analysis and pulldown experiments, we show that the C-terminal region of the NMIIA heavy chain binds to the 1–6 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of C2GnT-M. We have found that NMIIA co-localizes with C2GnT-M at the periphery of the Golgi. In addition, inhibition or knockdown of NMIIA prevents the brefeldin A-induced collapse of the Golgi as shown by the inhibition of the migration of both Giantin, a Golgi matrix protein, and C2GnT-M, a Golgi non-matrix protein, to the ER. In contrast, knockdown of HSP70 retains Giantin in the Golgi but moves C2GnT-M to the ER, a process also blocked by inhibition or knockdown of NMIIA. Also, the intracellular distribution of C2GnT-M is not affected by knockdown of β-coatomer protein with or without inhibition of HSPs, suggesting that the Golgi-to-ER trafficking of C2GnT-M does not depend on coat protein complex-I. Further, inhibition of proteasome results in accumulation of ubiquitinated C2GnT-M, suggesting its degradation by proteasome. Therefore, NMIIA and not coat protein complex-I is responsible for transporting the Golgi glycosyltransferase to the ER for proteasomal degradation. The data suggest that NMIIA is involved in the Golgi remodeling.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are a series of functional materials with storing and releasing energy properties. PCMs are able to adjust and control the environment around them through storing and releasing energy during phase change process. Based on the phase change theory, bis(1,3-dihydroxypropan-2-yl)4,4′-methylenebis(4,1-phenylene)dicarbamate, a novel tetrahydroxy compound, was designed and synthesized. Depending on the spatial structure of the tetrahydroxy compound, the form-stable thermoplastic polyurethane solid–solid phase change material (TPUPCM) was prepared. In the molecular structure of TPUPCM, polyethylene glycol was employed as the soft segments, and the hard segments were made up of 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and tetrahydroxy compound made up multi-benzene ring structure. The composition and structure, crystalline morphology, phase change behaviors, thermal performances and mechanical properties for tetrahydroxy compound and TPUPCM were investigated by using fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (1H NMR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimentry (DSC), thermogravimetry analysis system (TGA) and Instron 5566 tensile tester. The TPUPCM's the weight average molecular weight, number average molecular weight, dissolving and mechanical abilities were also tested. The results show that the solid–solid phase-change material possesses excellent phase-change properties and an applicable temperature range. The heating cycle phase-change enthalpy is 137.4J/g, and the cooling cycle phase-change enthalpy is 127.6J/g. The decomposition of TPUPCM starts and reaches a maximum at 323.5°C and 396.2°C, respectively. Furthermore, the solid–solid phase-change material is dissolvable, meltable and can be processed directly, and has potential applications in thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Optical concentrators that could be used as a flat panel type stationary photovoltaic (PV) system will enable significant reduction in the cost of PV power generation. This paper presents the analysis of a concentrator based on an optically transparent planar waveguide with a diffused reflector on the rear surface and PV devices placed at the edge of the waveguide. Optical collection efficiency of the stationary concentrator for geometric concentration ratios in the range 2–1000 has been analyzed. Despite reduction in optical collection efficiency of this concentrator design compared to traditional flat PV panel or tracking type concentrator panels, for practical operation in the geometric concentration ratio up to 40, a factor of 2–10 times reduction in cost of PV modules per unit power generated can be envisioned due to ease in manufacturing (including flexible roll-to-roll production) and significant savings in materials usage. Experimental data shows a strong dependence of the optical collection efficiency on surface roughness of the diffuser.

The interaction between megalin and ClC-5 is scaffolded by the Na+–H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) in proximal tubule cells,

Abstract: Albumin endocytosis in the proximal tubule is mediated by a number of proteins, including the scavenger receptor megalin/cubilin and the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) scaffolds NHERF1 and NHERF2. In addition, in a number of in vitro and in vivo models, the loss of ClC-5 results in a decreased cell surface expression and whole cell level of megalin, suggesting an interaction between these two proteins in vivo. We investigated if ClC-5 and megalin interact directly, and as ClC-5 binds to NHERF2, we investigated if this PDZ scaffold was required for a megalin/ClC-5 complex. GST-pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments using rat kidney lysate demonstrated an interaction between ClC-5 and megalin, which was mediated by their C-termini. As this interaction may be controlled by a scaffold protein, we characterised any interaction between megalin and NHERF2. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that megalin interacts with NHERF2 in vivo, and that this interaction was via an internal NHERF binding domain in the C-terminus of megalin and PDZ2 and the C-terminus of NHERF2. Silencing NHERF2 had no effect on megalin protein levels in the whole cell or plasma membrane. Using siRNA against NHERF2, we demonstrated that NHERF2 was required to facilitate the interaction between megalin and ClC-5. Using fusion proteins, we characterised a protein complex containing ClC-5 and megalin, which is scaffolded by NHERF2, in the absence of any other proteins. Importantly, these observations are the first to describe an interaction between megalin and ClC-5, which is scaffolded by NHERF2 in proximal tubule cells.
