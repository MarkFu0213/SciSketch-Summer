Abstract: Summary
Deletion of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-associated gene SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3), which encodes a postsynaptic anchoring protein at corticostriatal synapses, causes OCD-like motor behaviors in mice. While corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction is central to this phenotype, the striatum efficiently adapts to pathological changes, often in ways that expand upon the original circuit impairment. Here, we show that SAPAP3 deletion causes non-synaptic and pathway-specific alterations in dorsolateral striatum circuit function. While somatic excitability was elevated in striatal projection neurons (SPNs), dendritic excitability was exclusively enhanced in direct pathway SPNs. Layered on top of this, cholinergic modulation was altered in opposing ways: striatal cholinergic interneuron density and evoked acetylcholine release were elevated, while basal muscarinic modulation of SPNs was reduced. These data describe how SAPAP3 deletion alters the striatal landscape upon which impaired corticostriatal inputs will act, offering a basis for how pathological synaptic integration and unbalanced striatal output underlying OCD-like behaviors may be shaped.

Abstract: Summary
The Contactin-associated protein 1 (Cntnap1) mouse mutants fail to establish proper axonal domains in myelinated axons. Human CNTNAP1 mutations are linked to hypomyelinating neuropathy-3, which causes severe neurological deficits. To understand the human neuropathology and to model human CNTNAP1C323R and CNTNAP1R764C mutations, we generated Cntnap1C324R and Cntnap1R765C mouse mutants, respectively. Both Cntnap1 mutants show weight loss, reduced nerve conduction, and progressive motor dysfunction. The paranodal ultrastructure shows everted myelin loops and the absence of axo-glial junctions. Biochemical analysis reveals that these Cntnap1 mutant proteins are nearly undetectable in the paranodes, have reduced surface expression and stability, and are retained in the neuronal soma. Postnatal transgenic expression of Cntnap1 in the mutant backgrounds rescues the phenotypes and restores the organization of axonal domains with improved motor function. This study uncovers the mechanistic impact of two human CNTNAP1 mutations in a mouse model and provides proof of concept for gene therapy for CNTNAP1 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer (BC) prognosis and outcome are adversely affected by obesity. Hyperinsulinemia, common in the obese state, is associated with higher risk of death and recurrence in BC. Up to 80% of BCs overexpress the insulin receptor (INSR), which correlates with worse prognosis. INSR’s role in mammary tumorigenesis was tested by generating MMTV-driven polyoma middle T (PyMT) and ErbB2/Her2 BC mouse models, respectively, with coordinate mammary epithelium-restricted deletion of INSR. In both models, deletion of either one or both copies of INSR leads to a marked delay in tumor onset and burden. Longitudinal phenotypic characterization of mouse tumors and cells reveals that INSR deletion affects tumor initiation, not progression and metastasis. INSR upholds a bioenergetic phenotype in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, independent of its kinase activity. Similarity of phenotypes elicited by deletion of one or both copies of INSR suggest a dose-dependent threshold for INSR impact on mammary tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative stress-induced autophagy helps to prevent cellular damage and to maintain homeostasis. However, the regulatory pathway that initiates autophagy remains unclear. We previously showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling molecules to activate the ATM-CHK2 pathway and promote autophagy. Here, we find that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 functions downstream of ATM-CHK2 to regulate ATG7 ubiquitination. Under metabolic stress, ROS induce ATM phosphorylation at S1981, which in turn phosphorylates CHK2 at T68. We show that CHK2 binds and phosphorylates TRIM32 at the S55 site, which then mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of ATG7 at the K45 site to initiate autophagy. In addition, Chk2−/− mice show an aggravated infarction phenotype and reduced phosphorylation of TRIM32 and ubiquitination of ATG7 in a stroke model. We propose a molecular mechanism for autophagy initiation by ROS via the ATM-CHK2-TRIM32-ATG7 axis to maintain intracellular homeostasis and to protect cells exposed to pathological conditions from stress-induced tissue damage.

Abstract: Summary
Phages and lipids in human milk (HM) may benefit preterm infant health by preventing gastrointestinal pathobiont overgrowth and microbiome modulation. Lipid association may promote vertical transmission of phages to the infant. Despite this, interrelationships between lipids and phages are poorly characterized in preterm HM. Shotgun metagenomics and untargeted lipidomics of phage and lipid profiles from 99 preterm HM samples reveals that phages are abundant and prevalent from the first week and throughout the first 100 days of lactation. Phage-host richness of preterm HM increases longitudinally. Core phage communities characterized by Staphylococcus- and Propionibacterium-infecting phages are significantly correlated with long-chain fatty acid abundances over lactational age. We report here a phage-lipid interaction in preterm HM, highlighting the potential importance of phage carriage in preterm HM. These results reveal possible strategies for phage carriage in HM and their importance in early-life microbiota development.

Abstract: Summary
Focal adhesions (FAs) are dynamic protein assemblies that connect cytoskeletons to the extracellular matrix and are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. KANKs are scaffold proteins that encircle FAs and act as key regulators of FA dynamics, but the molecular mechanism underlying their specified localization and functions remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the KANK1 structures in complex with talin and liprin-β, respectively. These structures, combined with our biochemical and cellular analyses, demonstrate how KANK1 scaffolds the FA core and associated proteins to modulate the FA shape in response to mechanical force. Additionally, we find that KANK1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is important for its localization at the FA edge and cytoskeleton connections to FAs. Our findings not only indicate the molecular basis of KANKs in bridging the core and periphery of FAs but also provide insights into the LLPS-mediated dynamic regulation of FA morphology.

Abstract: Summary
Male infertility is a global health problem especially prevalent in high-altitude regions. The epididymis is essential for sperm maturation, but the influence of environmental cues on its reshaping remains poorly understood. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to track the cellular profiles of epidydimal cells in rats raised under normoxia or extended hypoxia. The results show that hypoxia impairs epididymal function, evident in reduced epithelial cells, compromised blood-epididymis barrier integrity, and increased natural killer cells. Through combined analysis of gene-regulatory networks and cell-cell interaction maps, we identify epididymal hypoxia-sensitive cells that communicate with natural killer (NK) cells via increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) driven by KLF4 recruitment of the histone methyltransferase ASL1L to the Icam1 promoter. Taken together, our study offers a detailed blueprint of epididymal changes during hypoxia and defines a KLF4-ALSH1L-ICAM-1 axis contributing to NK cell activation, yielding a potential treatment targeting hypoxia-induced infertility.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is a primary organism responsible for urinary tract infections and a common cause of sepsis. Microbially experienced laboratory mice, generated by cohousing with pet store mice, exhibit increased morbidity and mortality to polymicrobial sepsis or lipopolysaccharide challenge. By contrast, cohoused mice display significant resistance, compared with specific pathogen-free mice, to a monomicrobial sepsis model using UPEC. CD115+ monocytes mediate protection in the cohoused mice, as depletion of these cells leads to increased mortality and UPEC pathogen burden. Further study of the cohoused mice reveals increased TNF-α production by monocytes, a skewing toward Ly6ChiCD115+ “classical” monocytes, and enhanced egress of Ly6ChiCD115+ monocytes from the bone marrow. Analysis of cohoused bone marrow also finds increased frequency and number of myeloid multipotent progenitor cells. These results show that a history of microbial exposure impacts innate immunity in mice, which can have important implications for the preclinical study of sepsis.

Abstract: NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 gene isoforms and their splice variants are characteristically expressed in different regions of the brain. The tissue-specific splice variants of NCX1–3 isoforms show specific expression profiles in neurons and astrocytes, whereas the relevant NCX isoform/splice variants exhibit diverse allosteric modes of Na+- and Ca2+-dependent regulation. In general, overexpression of NCX1–3 genes leads to neuroprotective effects, whereas their ablation gains the opposite results. At this end, the partial contributions of NCX isoform/splice variants to neuroprotective effects remain unresolved. The glutamate-dependent Na+ entry generates Na+ transients (in response to neuronal cell activities), whereas the Na+-driven Ca2+ entry (through the reverse NCX mode) raises Ca2+ transients. This special mode of signal coupling translates Na+ transients into the Ca2+ signals while being a part of synaptic neurotransmission. This mechanism is of general interest since disease-related conditions (ischemia, metabolic stress, and stroke among many others) trigger Na+ and Ca2+ overload with deadly outcomes of downstream apoptosis and excitotoxicity. The recently discovered mechanisms of NCX allosteric regulation indicate that some NCX variants might play a critical role in the dynamic coupling of Na+-driven Ca2+ entry. In contrast, the others are less important or even could be dangerous under altered conditions (e.g., metabolic stress). This working hypothesis can be tested by applying advanced experimental approaches and highly focused computational simulations. This may allow the development of structure-based blockers/activators that can selectively modulate predefined NCX variants to lessen the life-threatening outcomes of excitotoxicity, ischemia, apoptosis, metabolic deprivation, brain injury, and stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Why some of us remember events more clearly than others and why memory loses precision over time is a major focus in memory research. Here, we show that the recruitment of specific neuroanatomical pathways within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the brain defines the precision of the memory recalled over the lifespan. Using optogenetics, neuronal activity mapping, and studying recent to very remote memories, we report that the hippocampal subfield CA1 is necessary for retrieving the gist of events and receives maximal support from MTL cortical areas (MEC, LEC, PER, and POR) for recalling the most remote memories. In contrast, reduction of CA3’s activity alone coincides with the loss of memory precision over time. We propose that a shift between specific MTL subnetworks over time might be a fundamental mechanism of memory consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Motor neuron (MN) development and nerve regeneration requires orchestrated action of a vast number of molecules. Here, we identify SorCS2 as a progranulin (PGRN) receptor that is required for MN diversification and axon outgrowth in zebrafish and mice. In zebrafish, SorCS2 knockdown also affects neuromuscular junction morphology and fish motility. In mice, SorCS2 and PGRN are co-expressed by newborn MNs from embryonic day 9.5 until adulthood. Using cell-fate tracing and nerve segmentation, we find that SorCS2 deficiency perturbs cell-fate decisions of brachial MNs accompanied by innervation deficits of posterior nerves. Additionally, adult SorCS2 knockout mice display slower motor nerve regeneration. Interestingly, primitive macrophages express high levels of PGRN, and their interaction with SorCS2-positive motor axon is required during axon pathfinding. We further show that SorCS2 binds PGRN to control its secretion, signaling, and conversion into granulins. We propose that PGRN-SorCS2 signaling controls MN development and regeneration in vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Oxytocin-expressing paraventricular hypothalamic neurons (PVNOT neurons) integrate afferent signals from the gut, including cholecystokinin (CCK), to adjust whole-body energy homeostasis. However, the molecular underpinnings by which PVNOT neurons orchestrate gut-to-brain feeding control remain unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing selective ablation of PVNOT neurons fail to reduce food intake in response to CCK and develop hyperphagic obesity on a chow diet. Notably, exposing wild-type mice to a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) diet recapitulates this insensitivity toward CCK, which is linked to diet-induced transcriptional and electrophysiological aberrations specifically in PVNOT neurons. Restoring OT pathways in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice via chemogenetics or polypharmacology sufficiently re-establishes CCK’s anorexigenic effects. Last, by single-cell profiling, we identify a specialized PVNOT neuronal subpopulation with increased κ-opioid signaling under an HFHS diet, which restrains their CCK-evoked activation. In sum, we document a (patho)mechanism by which PVNOT signaling uncouples a gut-brain satiation pathway under obesogenic conditions.

Abstract: Mucus hyperproduction and hypersecretion are observed often in respiratory diseases. MUC8 is a glycoprotein synthesized by epithelial cells and generally expressed in the respiratory track. However, the physiological mechanism by which extracellular nucleotides induce MUC8 gene expression in human airway epithelial cells is unclear. Here, we show that UTP could induce MUC8 gene expression through P2Y2-PLCβ3-Ca2+ activation. Because the full-length cDNA sequence of MUC8 has not been identified, a specific siRNA-MUC8 was designed based on the partial cDNA sequence of MUC8. siRNA-MUC8 significantly increased TNF-α production and decreased IL-1Ra production, suggesting that MUC8 may downregulate UTP/P2Y2-induced airway inflammation. Interestingly, the PDZ peptide of ZO-1 protein strongly abolished UTP-induced TNF-α production and increased IL-1Ra production and MUC8 gene expression. In addition, the PDZ peptide dramatically increased the levels of UTP-induced ZO proteins and TEER (trans-epithelial electrical resistance). These results show that the anti-inflammatory mucin MUC8 may contribute to homeostasis, and the PDZ peptide can be a novel therapeutic candidate for UTP-induced airway inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) plays a key role in maintaining vascular endothelial homeostasis. Here, we show that blood flows determine activation and inactivation of VEGFR2 through selective cysteine modifications. VEGFR2 activation is regulated by reversible oxidation at Cys1206 residue. H2O2-mediated VEGFR2 oxidation is induced by oscillatory flow in vascular endothelial cells through the induction of NADPH oxidase-4 expression. In contrast, laminar flow induces the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and results in the S-nitrosylation of VEGFR2 at Cys1206, which counteracts the oxidative inactivation. The shear stress model study reveals that disturbed blood flow operated by partial ligation in the carotid arteries induces endothelial damage and intimal hyperplasia in control mice but not in knock-in mice harboring the oxidation-resistant mutant (C1206S) of VEGFR2. Thus, our findings reveal that flow-dependent redox regulation of the VEGFR2 kinase is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the arterial endothelium.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloid neoplasms develop through acquisition of somatic mutations that confer mutation-specific fitness advantages to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, our understanding of mutational effects remains limited to the resolution attainable within immunophenotypically and clinically accessible bulk cell populations. To decipher heterogeneous cellular fitness to preleukemic mutational perturbations, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of eight different mouse models with driver mutations of myeloid malignancies, generating 269,048 single-cell profiles. Our analysis infers mutation-driven perturbations in cell abundance, cellular lineage fate, cellular metabolism, and gene expression at the continuous resolution, pinpointing cell populations with transcriptional alterations associated with differentiation bias. We further develop an 11-gene scoring system (Stem11) on the basis of preleukemic transcriptional signatures that predicts AML patient outcomes. Our results demonstrate that a single-cell-resolution deep characterization of preleukemic biology has the potential to enhance our understanding of AML heterogeneity and inform more effective risk stratification strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Visual perceptual experience induces persistent 4–8 Hz oscillations in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), encoding visual familiarity. Recent studies suggest that higher-order visual areas (HVAs) are functionally specialized and segregated into information streams processing distinct visual features. However, whether visual memories are processed and stored within the distinct streams is not understood. We report here that V1 and lateromedial (LM), but not V1 and anterolateral, become more phase synchronized in 4–8 Hz after the entrainment of visual stimulus that maximally induces responses in LM. Directed information analysis reveals changes in the top-down functional connectivity between V1 and HVAs. Optogenetic inactivation of LM reduces post-stimulus oscillation peaks in V1 and impairs visual discrimination behavior. Our results demonstrate that 4–8 Hz familiarity-evoked oscillations are specific for the distinct visual features and are present in the corresponding HVAs, where they may be used for the inter-areal communication with V1 during memory-related behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells exhibit immunosuppressive phenotypes and particular metabolic patterns with certain degrees of plasticity. Previous studies of the effects of the co-stimulatory molecule CD226 on Treg cells are controversial. Here, we show that CD226 primarily maintains the Treg cell stability and metabolism phenotype under inflammatory conditions. Conditional deletion of CD226 within Foxp3+ cells exacerbates symptoms in murine graft versus host disease models. Treg cell-specific deletion of CD226 increases the Treg cell percentage in immune organs but weakens their immunosuppressive function with a T helper 1-like phenotype conversion under inflammation. CD226-deficient Treg cells exhibit reduced oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis rates, which are regulated by the adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/myelocytomatosis oncogene (Myc) pathway, and inhibition of Myc signaling restores the impaired functions of CD226-deficient Treg cells in an inflammatory disease model of colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Although single-cell multi-omics technologies are undergoing rapid development, simultaneous transcriptome and proteome analysis of a single-cell individual still faces great challenges. Here, we developed a single-cell simultaneous transcriptome and proteome (scSTAP) analysis platform based on microfluidics, high-throughput sequencing, and mass spectrometry technology to achieve deep and joint quantitative analysis of transcriptome and proteome at the single-cell level, providing an important resource for understanding the relationship between transcription and translation in cells. This platform was applied to analyze single mouse oocytes at different meiotic maturation stages, reaching an average quantification depth of 19,948 genes and 2,663 protein groups in single mouse oocytes. In particular, we analyzed the correlation of individual RNA and protein pairs, as well as the meiosis regulatory network with unprecedented depth, and identified 30 transcript-protein pairs as specific oocyte maturational signatures, which could be productive for exploring transcriptional and translational regulatory features during oocyte meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Although high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis is known to affect atherosclerosis, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully explored. Here, we show that the progression of atherosclerosis depends on a gut microbiota shaped by an HFD but not a high-cholesterol (HC) diet and, more particularly, on low fiber (LF) intake. Mechanistically, gut lymphoid cells impacted by HFD- or LF-induced microbiota dysbiosis highly proliferate in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and migrate from MLNs to the periphery, which fuels T cell accumulation within atherosclerotic plaques. This is associated with the induction of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) within plaques and the presence of enterotropic lymphocytes expressing β7 integrin. MLN resection or lymphocyte deficiency abrogates the pro-atherogenic effects of a microbiota shaped by LF. Our study shows a pathological link between a diet-shaped microbiota, gut immune cells, and atherosclerosis, suggesting that a diet-modulated microbiome might be a suitable therapeutic target to prevent atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Generating organs from stem cells through blastocyst complementation is a promising approach to meet the clinical need for transplants. In order to generate rejection-free organs, complementation of both parenchymal and vascular cells must be achieved, as endothelial cells play a key role in graft rejection. Here, we used a lineage-specific cell ablation system to produce mouse embryos unable to form both the cardiac and vascular systems. By mouse intraspecies blastocyst complementation, we rescued heart and vascular system development separately and in combination, obtaining complemented hearts with cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells of exogenous origin. Complemented chimeras were viable and reached adult stage, showing normal cardiac function and no signs of histopathological defects in the heart. Furthermore, we implemented the cell ablation system for rat-to-mouse blastocyst complementation, obtaining xenogeneic hearts whose cardiomyocytes were completely of rat origin. These results represent an advance in the experimentation towards the in vivo generation of transplantable organs.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence suggests that immune receptors may participate in many aging-related processes such as energy metabolism, inflammation, and cognitive decline. CD300f, a TREM2-like lipid-sensing immune receptor, is an exceptional receptor as it integrates activating and inhibitory cell-signaling pathways that modulate inflammation, efferocytosis, and microglial metabolic fitness. We hypothesize that CD300f can regulate systemic aging-related processes and ultimately healthy lifespan. We closely followed several cohorts of two strains of CD300f−/− and WT mice of both sexes for 30 months and observed an important reduction in lifespan and healthspan in knockout mice. This was associated with systemic inflammaging, increased cognitive decline, reduced brain glucose uptake observed by 18FDG PET scans, enrichment in microglial aging/neurodegeneration phenotypes, proteostasis alterations, senescence, increased frailty, and sex-dependent systemic metabolic changes. Moreover, the absence of CD300f altered macrophage immunometabolic phenotype. Taken together, we provide strong evidence suggesting that myeloid cell CD300f immune receptor contributes to healthy aging.

Abstract: Summary
Whether synthetic genomes can power life has attracted broad interest in the synthetic biology field. Here, we report de novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome thus far, synIV, a 1,454,621-bp yeast chromosome resulting from extensive genome streamlining and modification. We developed megachunk assembly combined with a hierarchical integration strategy, which significantly increased the accuracy and flexibility of synthetic chromosome construction. Besides the drastic sequence changes, we further manipulated the 3D structure of synIV to explore spatial gene regulation. Surprisingly, we found few gene expression changes, suggesting that positioning inside the yeast nucleoplasm plays a minor role in gene regulation. Lastly, we tethered synIV to the inner nuclear membrane via its hundreds of loxPsym sites and observed transcriptional repression of the entire chromosome, demonstrating chromosome-wide transcription manipulation without changing the DNA sequences. Our manipulation of the spatial structure of synIV sheds light on higher-order architectural design of the synthetic genomes.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with mRNA to form supramolecular complexes called messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles. These dynamic assemblies direct and regulate individual steps of gene expression; however, their composition and functional importance remain largely unknown. Here, we develop a total internal reflection fluorescence-based single-molecule imaging assay to investigate stoichiometry and co-occupancy of 15 RBPs within mRNPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show compositional heterogeneity of single mRNPs and plasticity across different growth conditions, with major co-occupants of mRNPs containing the nuclear cap-binding complex identified as Yra1 (1–10 copies), Nab2 (1–6 copies), and Npl3 (1–6 copies). Multicopy Yra1-bound mRNPs are specifically co-occupied by the THO complex and assembled on mRNAs biased by transcript length and RNA secondary structure. Yra1 depletion results in decreased compaction of nuclear mRNPs demonstrating a packaging function. Together, we provide a quantitative framework for gene- and condition-dependent RBP occupancy and stoichiometry in individual nuclear mRNPs.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus is broadly impacted by neuromodulations. However, how neuropeptides shape the function of the hippocampus and the related spatial learning and memory remains unclear. Here, we discover the crucial role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in heterosynaptic neuromodulation from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to the hippocampus. Systematic knockout of the CCK gene impairs CA3-CA1 LTP and space-related performance. The MEC provides most of the CCK-positive neurons projecting to the hippocampal region, which potentiates CA3-CA1 long-term plasticity heterosynaptically in a frequency- and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent manner. Selective inhibition of MEC CCKergic neurons or downregulation of their CCK mRNA levels also impairs CA3-CA1 LTP formation and animals’ performance in the water maze. This excitatory extrahippocampal projection releases CCK upon high-frequency excitation and is active during animal exploration. Our results reveal the critical role of entorhinal CCKergic projections in bridging intra- and extrahippocampal circuitry at electrophysiological and behavioral levels.

Abstract: Summary
CAR-like membrane protein (CLMP) is a tight junction-associated protein whose mutation is associated with congenital short bowel syndrome (CSBS), but its functions in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CLMP is rarely mutated but significantly decreased in CRC patients, and its deficiency accelerates CRC tumorigenesis, growth, and resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Mechanistically, CLMP recruits β-catenin to cell membrane, independent of cadherin proteins. CLMP-mediated β-catenin translocation inactivates Wnt(Wingless and INT-1)/β-catenin signaling, thereby suppressing CRC tumorigenesis and growth in ApcMin/+, azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS), and orthotopic CRC mouse models. As a direct target of Wnt/β-catenin, cytochrome P450 hydroxylase A1 (CYP26A1)—an enzyme that degrades ATRA to a less bioactive retinoid—is upregulated by CLMP deficiency, resulting in ATRA-resistant CRC that can be reversed by administering CYP26A1 inhibitor. Collectively, our data identify the anti-CRC role of CLMP and suggest that CYP26A1 inhibitor enable to boost ATRA’s therapeutic efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
During epithelial tissue patterning, morphogens operate across multiple length scales to instruct cell identities. However, how cell fate changes are coordinated over these scales to establish spatial organization remains poorly understood. Here, we use human neural tube organoids as models of epithelial patterning and develop an in silico approach to define conditions permissive to patterning. By systematically varying morphogen position, diffusivity, and fate-inducing concentration levels, we show that cells follow a “neighborhood watch” (NW) mechanism that is deterministically dictated by initial morphogen source positions, reflecting scale-invariant in vitro phenotypes. We define how the frequency and local bias of morphogen sources stabilize pattern orientation. The model predicts enhanced patterning through floor plate inhibition, and receptor-ligand interaction analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data identifies wingless-related integration site (WNT) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) as inhibition modulators, which we validate in vitro. These results suggest that developing neuroepithelia employ NW-based mechanisms to organize morphogen sources, define cellular identity, and establish patterns.

Abstract: We set up this study to understand the underlying mechanisms of reduced ceramides on immune cells in acute rejection (AR). The concentrations of ceramides and sphingomyelins were measured in the sera from hepatic transplant patients, skin graft mice and hepatocyte transplant mice by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Serum concentrations of C24 ceramide, C24:1 ceramide, C16:0 sphingomyelin, and C18:1 sphingomyelin were lower in liver transplantation (LT) recipients with than without AR. Comparisons with the results of LT patients with infection and cardiac transplant patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy in humans and in mouse skin graft and hepatocyte transplant models suggested that the reduced C24 and C24:1 ceramides were specifically involved in AR. A ceramide synthase inhibitor, fumonisin B1 exacerbated allogeneic immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and reduced tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs), while increased P3-like plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in the draining lymph nodes from allogeneic skin graft mice. The results of mixed lymphocyte reactions with ceranib-2, an inhibitor of ceramidase, and C24 ceramide also support that increasing ceramide concentrations could benefit transplant recipients with AR. The results suggest increasing ceramides as novel therapeutic target for AR, where reduced ceramides were associated with the changes in DC subsets, in particular tDCs.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the complete synthesis, assembly, debugging, and characterization of a synthetic 404,963 bp chromosome, synIX (synthetic chromosome IX). Combined chromosome construction methods were used to synthesize and integrate its left arm (synIXL) into a strain containing previously described synIXR. We identified and resolved a bug affecting expression of EST3, a crucial gene for telomerase function, producing a synIX strain with near wild-type fitness. To facilitate future synthetic chromosome consolidation and increase flexibility of chromosome transfer between distinct strains, we combined chromoduction, a method to transfer a whole chromosome between two strains, with conditional centromere destabilization to substitute a chromosome of interest for its native counterpart. Both steps of this chromosome substitution method were efficient. We observed that wild-type II tended to co-transfer with synIX and was co-destabilized with wild-type IX, suggesting a potential gene dosage compensation relationship between these chromosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Most epithelial tissues are maintained by stem cells that produce the different cell lineages required for proper tissue function. Constant communication between different cell types ensures precise regulation of stem cell behavior and cell fate decisions. These cell-cell interactions are often disrupted during tumorigenesis, but mechanisms by which they are co-opted to support tumor growth in different genetic contexts are poorly understood. Here, we introduce PromoterSwitch, a genetic platform we established to generate large, transformed clones derived from individual adult Drosophila intestinal stem/progenitor cells. We show that cancer-driving genetic alterations representing common colon tumor genome landscapes disrupt cell fate decisions within transformed tissue and result in the emergence of abnormal cell fates. We also show that transformed enteroendocrine cells, a differentiated, hormone-secreting cell lineage, support tumor growth by regulating intestinal stem cell proliferation through multiple genotype-dependent mechanisms, which represent potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The Ski2-Ski3-Ski8 (Ski238) helicase complex directs cytoplasmic mRNAs toward the nucleolytic exosome complex for degradation. In yeast, the interaction between Ski238 and exosome requires the adaptor protein Ski7. We determined different cryo-EM structures of the Ski238 complex depicting the transition from a rigid autoinhibited closed conformation to a flexible active open conformation in which the Ski2 helicase module has detached from the rest of Ski238. The open conformation favors the interaction of the Ski3 subunit with exosome-bound Ski7, leading to the recruitment of the exosome. In the Ski238-Ski7-exosome holocomplex, the Ski2 helicase module binds the exosome cap, enabling the RNA to traverse from the helicase through the internal exosome channel to the Rrp44 exoribonuclease. Our study pinpoints how conformational changes within the Ski238 complex regulate exosome recruitment for RNA degradation. We also reveal the remarkable conservation of helicase-exosome RNA channeling mechanisms throughout eukaryotic nuclear and cytoplasmic exosome complexes.

Abstract: Summary
The intrinsic regulation of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression remains unclear. Here, we report that zinc-finger protein 652 (ZNF652) is a potent transcription repressor of PD-L1. ZNF652 frequently experiences loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in various cancers. Higher LOH rate and lack of estrogen-inducible transcription lead to suppressed expression of ZNF652 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, ZNF652 is physically associated with the NuRD transcription co-repressor complex to repress a cohort of genes, including PD-L1. Overexpression of ZNF652 inhibits PD-L1 transcription, whereas depletion of ZNF652 upregulates PD-L1. Loss of ZNF652 in TNBC unleashes PD-L1-mediated immune evasion both in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, ZNF652 expression is progressively lost during breast cancer progression, and a low ZNF652 level is correlated with elevated PD-L1 expression, less infiltrated CD8+ T cells, and poor prognosis in TNBC. Our study provides insights into PD-L1 regulation and supports the pursuit of ZNF652 as a potential biomarker and drug target for breast cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunctional mitochondria are removed via multiple pathways, such as mitophagy, a selective autophagy process. Here, we identify an intracellular hybrid mitochondria-lysosome organelle (termed the mitochondria-lysosome-related organelle [MLRO]), which regulates mitochondrial homeostasis independent of canonical mitophagy during hepatocyte dedifferentiation. The MLRO is an electron-dense organelle that has either a single or double membrane with both mitochondria and lysosome markers. Mechanistically, the MLRO is likely formed from the fusion of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) with lysosomes through a PARKIN-, ATG5-, and DRP1-independent process, which is negatively regulated by transcription factor EB (TFEB) and associated with mitochondrial protein degradation and hepatocyte dedifferentiation. The MLRO, which is galectin-3 positive, is reminiscent of damaged lysosome and could be cleared by overexpression of TFEB, resulting in attenuation of hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Together, results from this study suggest that the MLRO may act as an alternative mechanism for mitochondrial quality control independent of canonical autophagy/mitophagy involved in cell dedifferentiation.

Abstract: The plant defense responses to microbial infection are tightly regulated and integrated with the developmental program for optimal resources allocation. Notably, the defense-associated hormone salicylic acid (SA) acts as a promoter of flowering while several plant pathogens actively target the flowering signaling pathway to promote their virulence or dissemination. Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum inject tens of effectors in the host cells that collectively promote bacterial proliferation in plant tissues. Here, we characterized the function of the broadly conserved R. pseudosolanacearum effector RipL, through heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. RipL-expressing transgenic lines presented a delayed flowering, which correlated with a low expression of flowering regulator genes. Delayed flowering was also observed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants transiently expressing RipL. In parallel, RipL promoted plant susceptibility to virulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae in the effector-expressing lines or when delivered by the type III secretion system. Unexpectedly, SA accumulation and SA-dependent immune signaling were not significantly affected by RipL expression. Rather, the RNA-seq analysis of infected RipL-expressing lines revealed that the overall amplitude of the transcriptional response was dampened, suggesting that RipL could promote plant susceptibility in an SA-independent manner. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underpinning RipL effect on flowering and immunity may reveal novel effector functions in host cells.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in antiviral innate response warrant further investigation. Here, we identify an lncRNA, termed lncRNA-BTX (between Tbk1 and Xpot), which is upregulated upon viral infection via an IRF3-type I interferon-independent pathway, promoting viral innate immune escape. Deletion of lncRNA-BTX in cells or mice significantly reduces viral load in vitro or in vivo, respectively. Mechanistically, lncRNA-BTX strengthens the interactions between DHX9 or ILF3 (two RBPs that have opposite functions in regulating the replication of RNA virus) and their respective partner, JMJD6 or ILF2, which regulates intracellular translocations of DHX9 and ILF3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Put simply, lncRNA-BTX facilitates DHX9’s return to the cytoplasm and retains ILF3 within the nucleus, promoting viral replication. This work unveils a strategy developed by the virus to bypass host innate immunity, thus providing a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Methylation of CG dinucleotides (mCGs), which regulates eukaryotic genome functions, is epigenetically propagated by Dnmt1/MET1 methyltransferases. How mCG is established and transmitted across generations despite imperfect enzyme fidelity is unclear. Whether mCG variation in natural populations is governed by genetic or epigenetic inheritance also remains mysterious. Here, we show that MET1 de novo activity, which is enhanced by existing proximate methylation, seeds and stabilizes mCG in Arabidopsis thaliana genes. MET1 activity is restricted by active demethylation and suppressed by histone variant H2A.Z, producing localized mCG patterns. Based on these observations, we develop a stochastic mathematical model that precisely recapitulates mCG inheritance dynamics and predicts intragenic mCG patterns and their population-scale variation given only CG site spacing. Our results demonstrate that intragenic mCG establishment, inheritance, and variance constitute a unified epigenetic process, revealing that intragenic mCG undergoes large, millennia-long epigenetic fluctuations and can therefore mediate evolution on this timescale.

Abstract: Summary
The oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) is regulated by maternal products stored in the oocyte cytoplasm, independent of transcription. How maternal products are precisely remodeled to dictate the OET remains largely unclear. In this work, we discover the dynamic solubility phase transition of maternal RNAs during Xenopus OET. We have identified 863 maternal transcripts that transition from a soluble state to a detergent-insoluble one after oocyte maturation. These RNAs are enriched in the animal hemisphere, and many of them encode key cell cycle regulators. In contrast, 165 transcripts, including nearly all Xenopus germline RNAs and some vegetally localized somatic RNAs, undergo an insoluble-to-soluble phase transition. This phenomenon is conserved in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that the phase transition of germline RNAs influences their susceptibility to RNA degradation machinery and is mediated by the remodeling of germ plasm. This work thus identifies important remodeling mechanisms that act on RNAs to control vertebrate OET.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-suppressive cell competition (TSCC) is a conserved surveillance mechanism in which neighboring cells actively eliminate oncogenic cells. Despite overwhelming studies showing that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is dysregulated in various tumors, it remains debatable whether the UPR restrains or promotes tumorigenesis. Here, using Drosophila eye epithelium as a model, we uncover a surprising decisive role of the Ire1 branch of the UPR in regulating cell polarity gene scribble (scrib) loss-induced TSCC. Both mutation and hyperactivation of Ire1 accelerate elimination of scrib clones via inducing apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Unexpectedly, relative Ire1 activity is also crucial for determining loser cell fate, as dysregulating Ire1 signaling in the surrounding healthy cells reversed the “loser” status of scrib clones by decreasing their apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Ire1 is required for cell competition in mammalian cells. Together, these findings provide molecular insights into scrib-mediated TSCC and highlight Ire1 as a key determinant of loser cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
We designed and synthesized synI, which is ∼21.6% shorter than native chrI, the smallest chromosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SynI was designed for attachment to another synthetic chromosome due to concerns surrounding potential instability and karyotype imbalance and is now attached to synIII, yielding the first synthetic yeast fusion chromosome. Additional fusion chromosomes were constructed to study nuclear function. ChrIII-I and chrIX-III-I fusion chromosomes have twisted structures, which depend on silencing protein Sir3. As a smaller chromosome, chrI also faces special challenges in assuring meiotic crossovers required for efficient homolog disjunction. Centromere deletions into fusion chromosomes revealed opposing effects of core centromeres and pericentromeres in modulating deposition of the crossover-promoting protein Red1. These effects extend over 100 kb and promote disproportionate Red1 enrichment, and thus crossover potential, on small chromosomes like chrI. These findings reveal the power of synthetic genomics to uncover new biology and deconvolute complex biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade therapies are still ineffective for most patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Immunogenic cell death (ICD) enables the release of key immunostimulatory signals to drive efficient anti-tumor immunity, which could be used to potentiate the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we showed that inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCP) elicits ICD in CRC. Meanwhile, VCP inhibitor upregulates PD-L1 expression and compromises anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Mechanistically, VCP transcriptionally regulates PD-L1 expression in a JAK1-dependent manner. Combining VCP inhibitor with anti-PD1 remodels tumor immune microenvironment and reduces tumor growth in mouse models of CRC. Addition of oncolytic virus further augments the therapeutic activity of the combination regimen. Our study shows the molecular mechanism for regulating PD-L1 expression by VCP and suggests that inhibition of VCP has the potential to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
The role of BACH1 in the process of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remains unknown. Here, we find that the loss of BACH1 in hESCs attenuates the expression of VSMC marker genes, whereas overexpression of BACH1 after mesoderm induction increases the expression of VSMC markers during in vitro hESC-VSMC differentiation. Mechanistically, BACH1 binds directly to coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) during in vitro hESC-VSMC differentiation, and this interaction is mediated by the BACH1 bZIP domain. BACH1 recruits CARM1 to VSMC marker gene promoters and promotes VSMC marker expression by increasing H3R17me2 modification, thus facilitating in vitro VSMC differentiation from hESCs after the mesoderm induction. The increased expression of VSMC marker genes by BACH1 overexpression is partially abolished by inhibition of CARM1 or the H3R17me2 inhibitor TBBD in hESC-derived cells. These findings highlight the critical role of BACH1 in hESC differentiation into VSMCs by CARM1-mediated methylation of H3R17.

Abstract: Summary
Liver metastases are associated with poor response to current pharmacological treatments, including immunotherapy. We describe a lentiviral vector (LV) platform to selectively engineer liver macrophages, including Kupffer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), to deliver type I interferon (IFNα) to liver metastases. Gene-based IFNα delivery delays the growth of colorectal and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma liver metastases in mice. Response to IFNα is associated with TAM immune activation, enhanced MHC-II-restricted antigen presentation and reduced exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Conversely, increased IL-10 signaling, expansion of Eomes CD4+ T cells, a cell type displaying features of type I regulatory T (Tr1) cells, and CTLA-4 expression are associated with resistance to therapy. Targeting regulatory T cell functions by combinatorial CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade and IFNα LV delivery expands tumor-reactive T cells, attaining complete response in most mice. These findings support a promising therapeutic strategy with feasible translation to patients with unmet medical need.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) can improve tumor immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with elevated T cell infiltration and sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. However, the lack of reliable biomarkers limits utilization of LSD1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. Here, we identify an E3 ligase, Trim35, as an effective biomarker for high activity of LSD1 to predict prognosis of LSD1-targeted therapy as well as immunotherapy. Mechanistically, Trim35 represses LSD1 demethylase activity by mediating K63 ubiquitination at lysine site 422 of LSD1. Suppressed LSD1 activity facilitates ERGIC1 transcription, followed by autophagy inhibition and IFNGR1 stabilization to activate IFN-γ signaling, leading to increased MHC class I expression and immune surveillance of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, combinational use of an LSD1 inhibitor and anti-PD-1 therapy can significantly eradicate poorly immunogenic lung cancer with low Trim35. These findings strongly suggest that Trim35 is a promising biomarker for prediction of immunotherapy outcome in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident effector cells with roles in tissue homeostasis, protective immunity, and inflammatory disease. Group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are classically defined by the master transcription factor RORγt. However, ILC3 can be further subdivided into subsets that share type 3 effector modules that exhibit significant ontological, transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional heterogeneity. Notably lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like ILC3s mediate effector functions not typically associated with other RORγt-expressing lymphocytes, suggesting that additional transcription factors contribute to dictate ILC3 subset phenotypes. Here, we identify Bcl6 as a subset-defining transcription factor of LTi-like ILC3s in mice and humans. Deletion of Bcl6 results in dysregulation of the LTi-like ILC3 transcriptional program and markedly enhances expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F in LTi-like ILC3s in a manner in part dependent upon the commensal microbiota—and associated with worsened inflammation in a model of colitis. Together, these findings redefine our understanding of ILC3 subset biology.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-I) response is the first line of host defense against invading viruses. In the absence of definite mouse models, the role of IFN-I in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains perplexing. Here, we develop two mouse models, one with constitutively high IFN-I response (hACE2; Irgm1−/−) and the other with dampened IFN-I response (hACE2; Ifnar1−/−), to comprehend the role of IFN-I response. We report that hACE2; Irgm1−/− mice are resistant to lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection along with immune cell infiltration, cytokine storm, and enhanced pathology is observed in the lungs and brain of hACE2; Ifnar1−/− mice. The hACE2; Irgm1−/−Ifnar1−/− double-knockout mice display loss of the protective phenotype observed in hACE2; Irgm1−/− mice, suggesting that heightened IFN-I response accounts for the observed immunity. Taking the results together, we demonstrate that IFN-I protects from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection, and Irgm1 (IRGM) could be an excellent therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
The reduced effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines due to the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) necessitated the use of vaccine boosters to bolster protection against disease. However, it remains unclear how boosting expands protective breadth when primary vaccine platforms are distinct and how boosters containing VOC spike(s) broaden humoral responses. Here, we report that boosters composed of recombinant spike antigens of ancestral (prototype) and Beta VOCs elicit a robust, pan-VOC, and multi-functional humoral response in non-human primates largely independent of the primary vaccine series platform. Interestingly, Beta-spike-containing boosters stimulate immunoglobulin A (IgA) with a greater breadth of recognition in protein-primed recipients when administered with adjuvant system 03 (AS03). Our results highlight the utility of a component-based booster strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for broad humoral recognition, independent of primary vaccine series. This is of high global health importance given the heterogeneity of primary vaccination platforms distributed.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) regulates the proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells. However, its role in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and early embryonic development remains poorly understood. Here, we report the presence of short C-terminal MSI1 (MSI1-C) proteins in early mouse embryos and mouse ESCs, but not in human ESCs, under conventional culture conditions. In mouse embryos and mESCs, deletion of MSI1-C together with full-length MSI1 causes early embryonic developmental arrest and pluripotency dissolution. MSI1-C is induced upon naive induction and facilitates hESC naive pluripotency acquisition, elevating the pluripotency of primed hESCs toward a formative-like state. MSI1-C proteins are nuclear localized and bind to RNAs involved in DNA-damage repair (including MLH1, BRCA1, and MSH2), conferring on hESCs better survival in human-mouse interspecies cell competition and prolonged ability to form blastoids. This study identifies MSI1-C as an essential regulator in ESC pluripotency states and early embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Pain and itch coding mechanisms in polymodal sensory neurons remain elusive. MrgprD+ neurons represent a major polymodal population and mediate both mechanical pain and nonhistaminergic itch. Here, we show that chemogenetic activation of MrgprD+ neurons elicited both pain- and itch-related behavior in a dose-dependent manner, revealing an unanticipated compatibility between pain and itch in polymodal neurons. While VGlut2-dependent glutamate release is required for both pain and itch transmission from MrgprD+ neurons, the neuropeptide neuromedin B (NMB) is selectively required for itch signaling. Electrophysiological recordings further demonstrated that glutamate synergizes with NMB to excite NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons. Ablation of these spinal neurons selectively abolished itch signals from MrgprD+ neurons, without affecting pain signals, suggesting a dedicated itch-processing central circuit. These findings reveal distinct neurotransmitters and neural circuit requirements for pain and itch signaling from MrgprD+ polymodal sensory neurons, providing new insights on coding and processing of pain and itch.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor growth is driven by continued cellular growth and proliferation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7’s (CDK7) role in activating mitotic CDKs and global gene expression makes it therefore an attractive target for cancer therapies. However, what makes cancer cells particularly sensitive to CDK7 inhibition (CDK7i) remains unclear. Here, we address this question. We show that CDK7i, by samuraciclib, induces a permanent cell-cycle exit, known as senescence, without promoting DNA damage signaling or cell death. A chemogenetic genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen identified that active mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling promotes samuraciclib-induced senescence. mTOR inhibition decreases samuraciclib sensitivity, and increased mTOR-dependent growth signaling correlates with sensitivity in cancer cell lines. Reverting a growth-promoting mutation in PIK3CA to wild type decreases sensitivity to CDK7i. Our work establishes that enhanced growth alone promotes CDK7i sensitivity, providing an explanation for why some cancers are more sensitive to CDK inhibition than normally growing cells.

Abstract: Summary
TRPA1 is pivotal in cold hypersensitivity, but its regulatory mechanisms in inflammatory cold hyperalgesia remain poorly understood. We show here that the upregulation of SUMO1-conjugated protein levels in a complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain model enhances TRPA1 mRNA stability, ultimately leading to increased expression levels. We further demonstrate that hnRNPA1 binds to TRPA1 mRNA, and its SUMOylation, upregulated in CFA-induced inflammatory pain, contributes to stabilizing TRPA1 mRNA by accumulating hnRNPA1 in the cytoplasm. Moreover, we find that wild-type hnRNPA1 viral infection in dorsal root ganglia neurons, and not infection with the SUMOylation-deficient hnRNPA1 mutant, can rescue the reduced ability of hnRNPA1-knockdown mice to develop inflammatory cold pain hypersensitivity. These results suggest that hnRNPA1 is a regulator of TRPA1 mRNA stability, the capability of which is enhanced upon SUMO1 conjugation at lysine 3 in response to peripheral inflammation, and the increased expression of TRPA1 in turn underlies the development of chronic inflammatory cold pain hypersensitivity.

Whether such periodicity exists for behaviorally relevant time scales in the human brain remains unclear. We investigate neuronal firing during a temporally continuous experience by presenting 14 neurosurgical patients with a video while recording neuronal activity from multiple brain regions. We report on neurons that modulate their activity in a periodic manner across different time scales—from seconds to many minutes, most prevalently in the entorhinal cortex. These neurons remap their dominant periodicity to shorter time scales during a subsequent recognition memory task. When the video is presented at two different speeds, a significant percentage of these temporally periodic cells (TPCs) maintain their time scales, suggesting a degree of invariance. The TPCs’ temporal periodicity might complement the spatial periodicity of grid cells and together provide scalable spatiotemporal metrics for human experience.

Abstract: Summary
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disease caused by the loss of the dystrophin protein. Exon skipping is a promising strategy to treat DMD by restoring truncated dystrophin. Here, we demonstrate that base editors (e.g., targeted AID-mediated mutagenesis [TAM]) are able to efficiently induce exon skipping by disrupting functional redundant exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). By developing an unbiased and high-throughput screening to interrogate exonic sequences, we successfully identify novel ESEs in DMD exons 51 and 53. TAM-CBE (cytidine base editor) induces near-complete skipping of the respective exons by targeting these ESEs in patients’ induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. Combined with strategies to disrupt splice sites, we identify suitable single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with TAM-CBE to efficiently skip most DMD hotspot exons without substantial double-stranded breaks. Our study thus expands the repertoire of potential targets for CBE-mediated exon skipping in treating DMD and other RNA mis-splicing diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Generating cells with the molecular and functional properties of embryo cells and with full developmental potential is an aim with fundamental biological significance. Here we report the in vitro generation of mouse transient morula-like cells (MLCs) via the manipulation of signaling pathways. MLCs are molecularly distinct from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and cluster instead with embryo 8- to 16-cell stage cells. A single MLC can generate a blastoid, and the efficiency increases to 80% when 8–10 MLCs are used. MLCs make embryoids directly, efficiently, and within 4 days. Transcriptomic analysis shows that day 4–5 MLC-derived embryoids contain the cell types found in natural embryos at early gastrulation. Furthermore, MLCs introduced into morulae segregate into epiblast (EPI), primitive endoderm (PrE), and trophectoderm (TE) fates in blastocyst chimeras and have a molecular signature indistinguishable from that of host embryo cells. These findings represent the generation of cells that are molecularly and functionally similar to the precursors of the first three cell lineages of the embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosome-level design-build-test-learn cycles (chrDBTLs) allow systematic combinatorial reconfiguration of chromosomes with ease. Here, we established chrDBTL with a redesigned synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV, synXV. We designed and built synXV to harbor strategically inserted features, modified elements, and synonymously recoded genes throughout the chromosome. Based on the recoded chromosome, we developed a method to enable chrDBTL: CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mitotic recombination with endoreduplication (CRIMiRE). CRIMiRE allowed the creation of customized wild-type/synthetic combinations, accelerating genotype-phenotype mapping and synthetic chromosome redesign. We also leveraged synXV as a “build-to-learn” model organism for translation studies by ribosome profiling. We conducted a locus-to-locus comparison of ribosome occupancy between synXV and the wild-type chromosome, providing insight into the effects of codon changes and redesigned features on translation dynamics in vivo. Overall, we established synXV as a versatile reconfigurable system that advances chrDBTL for understanding biological mechanisms and engineering strains.

Abstract: Summary
Development is regulated by various factors, including protein methylation status. While PRMT5 is well known for its roles in oncogenesis by mediating symmetric di-methylation of arginine, its role in normal development remains elusive. Using Myod1Cre to drive Prmt5 knockout in embryonic myoblasts (Prmt5MKO), we dissected the role of PRMT5 in myogenesis. The Prmt5MKO mice are born normally but exhibit progressive muscle atrophy and premature death. Prmt5MKO inhibits proliferation and promotes premature differentiation of embryonic myoblasts, reducing the number and regenerative function of satellite cells in postnatal mice. Mechanistically, PRMT5 methylates and destabilizes FoxO1. Prmt5MKO increases the total FoxO1 level and promotes its cytoplasmic accumulation, leading to activation of autophagy and depletion of lipid droplets (LDs). Systemic inhibition of autophagy in Prmt5MKO mice restores LDs in myoblasts and moderately improves muscle regeneration. Together, PRMT5 is essential for muscle development and regeneration at least partially through mediating FoxO1 methylation and LD turnover.

Abstract: Summary
Pollen tube integrity is required for achieving double fertilization in angiosperms. The rapid alkalinization factor4/19-ANXUR1/2-Buddha’s paper seal 1/2 (RALF4/19-ANX1/2-BUPS1/2)-complex-mediated signaling pathway is critical to maintain pollen tube integrity, but the underlying mechanisms regulating the polar localization and distribution of these complex members at the pollen tube tip remain unclear. Here, we find that COBRA-like protein 11 (COBL11) loss-of-function mutants display a low pollen germination ratio, premature pollen tube burst, and seed abortion in Arabidopsis. COBL11 could interact with RALF4/19, ANX1/2, and BUPS1/2, and COBL11 functional deficiency could result in the disrupted distribution of RALF4 and ANX1, altered cell wall composition, and decreased levels of reactive oxygen species in pollen tubes. In conclusion, COBL11 is a regulator of pollen tube integrity during polar growth, which is conducted by a direct interaction that ensures the correct localization and polar distribution of RALF4 and ANX1 at the pollen tube tip.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the degradative ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC) alter neurodevelopment by impairing proteasomal protein clearance, but our understanding of their molecular and cellular pathogenesis remains limited. Here, we employ the proteomic-based discovery of APC substrates in APC mutant mouse brain and human cell lines and identify the chromosome-passenger complex (CPC), topoisomerase 2a (Top2a), and Ki-67 as major chromatin factors targeted by the APC during neuronal differentiation. These substrates accumulate in phosphorylated form, suggesting that they fail to be eliminated after mitosis during terminal differentiation. The accumulation of the CPC kinase Aurora B within constitutive heterochromatin and hyperphosphorylation of its target histone 3 are corrected in the mutant brain by pharmacologic Aurora B inhibition. Surprisingly, the reduction of Ki-67, but not H3S10ph, rescued the function of constitutive heterochromatin in APC mutant neurons. These results expand our understanding of how ubiquitin signaling regulates chromatin during neurodevelopment and identify potential therapeutic targets in APC-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA exosome is a versatile ribonuclease. In the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells, it is assisted by its adaptors the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex and the poly(A) exosome targeting (PAXT) connection. Via its association with the ARS2 and ZC3H18 proteins, NEXT/exosome is recruited to capped and short unadenylated transcripts. Conversely, PAXT/exosome is considered to target longer and adenylated substrates via their poly(A) tails. Here, mutational analysis of the core PAXT component ZFC3H1 uncovers a separate branch of the PAXT pathway, which targets short adenylated RNAs and relies on a direct ARS2-ZFC3H1 interaction. We further demonstrate that similar acidic-rich short linear motifs of ZFC3H1 and ZC3H18 compete for a common ARS2 epitope. Consequently, while promoting NEXT function, ZC3H18 antagonizes PAXT activity. We suggest that this organization of RNA decay complexes provides co-activation of NEXT and PAXT at loci with abundant production of short exosome substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Comparative studies of related but ecologically distinct species can reveal how the nervous system evolves to drive behaviors that are particularly suited to certain environments. Drosophila melanogaster is a generalist that feeds and oviposits on most overripe fruits. A sibling species, D. sechellia, is an obligate specialist of Morinda citrifolia (noni) fruit, which is rich in fatty acids (FAs). To understand evolution of noni taste preference, we characterized behavioral and cellular responses to noni-associated FAs in three related drosophilids. We find that mixtures of sugar and noni FAs evoke strong aversion in the generalist species but not in D. sechellia. Surveys of taste sensory responses reveal noni FA- and species-specific differences in at least two mechanisms—bitter neuron activation and sweet neuron inhibition–that correlate with shifts in noni preference. Chemoreceptor mutant analysis in D. melanogaster predicts that multiple genetic changes account for evolution of gustatory preference in D. sechellia.

Abstract: Summary
The extrahepatic branches of the biliary tree have glands that connect to the surface epithelium through narrow pits. The duct epithelia undergo homeostatic renewal, yet the identity and multiplicity of cells that maintain this tissue is unknown. Using marker-free and targeted clonal fate mapping in mice, we provide evidence that the extrahepatic bile duct is compartmentalized. Pit cholangiocytes of extramural glands renewed the surface epithelium, whereas basally oriented cholangiocytes maintained the gland itself. In contrast, basally positioned cholangiocytes replenished the surface epithelium in mural glands. Single-cell sequencing identified genes enriched in the base and surface epithelial populations, with trajectory analysis showing graded gene expression between these compartments. Epithelia were plastic, changing cellular identity upon fasting and refeeding. Gain of canonical Wnt signaling caused basal cell expansion, gastric chief cell marker expression, and a decrease in surface epithelial markers. Our results identify the cellular hierarchy governing extrahepatic biliary epithelial renewal.

Abstract: Summary
The rising pancreatic cancer incidence due to obesity and type 2 diabetes is closely tied to hyperinsulinemia, an independent cancer risk factor. Previous studies demonstrated reducing insulin production suppressed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pre-cancerous lesions in Kras-mutant mice. However, the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms remained unknown, and in particular it was unclear whether hyperinsulinemia affected PanIN precursor cells directly or indirectly. Here, we demonstrate that insulin receptors (Insr) in KrasG12D-expressing pancreatic acinar cells are dispensable for glucose homeostasis but necessary for hyperinsulinemia-driven PanIN formation in the context of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Mechanistically, this was attributed to amplified digestive enzyme protein translation, triggering of local inflammation, and PanIN metaplasia in vivo. In vitro, insulin dose-dependently increased acinar-to-ductal metaplasia formation in a trypsin- and Insr-dependent manner. Collectively, our data shed light on the mechanisms connecting obesity-driven hyperinsulinemia and pancreatic cancer development.

Abstract: Summary
While 19S proteasome regulatory particle (RP) inhibition is a promising new avenue for treating bortezomib-resistant myeloma, the anti-tumor impact of inhibiting 19S RP component PSMD14 could not be explained by a selective inhibition of proteasomal activity. Here, we report that PSMD14 interacts with NSD2 on chromatin, independent of 19S RP. Functionally, PSMD14 acts as a histone H2AK119 deubiquitinase, facilitating NSD2-directed H3K36 dimethylation. Integrative genomic and epigenomic analyses revealed the functional coordination of PSMD14 and NSD2 in transcriptional activation of target genes (e.g., RELA) linked to myelomagenesis. Reciprocally, RELA transactivates PSMD14, forming a PSMD14/NSD2-RELA positive feedback loop. Remarkably, PSMD14 inhibitors enhance bortezomib sensitivity and fosters anti-myeloma synergy. PSMD14 expression is elevated in myeloma and inversely correlated with overall survival. Our study uncovers an unappreciated function of PSMD14 as an epigenetic regulator and a myeloma driver, supporting the pursuit of PSMD14 as a therapeutic target to overcome the treatment limitation of myeloma.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF1α triggers adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance in obese patients. HIF1α closely interacts with PPARγ, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, but there are conflicting results regarding how this interaction controls the excessive lipid accumulation that drives adipocyte dysfunction. To directly address these conflicts, we established a differentiation system that recapitulated prior seemingly opposing observations made across different experimental settings. Using single-cell imaging and coarse-grained mathematical modeling, we show how HIF1α can both promote and repress lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. Our model predicted and our experiments confirmed that the opposing roles of HIF1α are isolated from each other by the positive-feedback-mediated upregulation of PPARγ that drives adipocyte differentiation. Finally, we identify three factors: strength of the differentiation cue, timing of hypoxic perturbation, and strength of HIF1α expression changes that, when considered together, provide an explanation for many of the previous conflicting reports.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019—underlines the need to develop broadly active vaccines against the Merbecovirus and Sarbecovirus betacoronavirus subgenera. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines protect against severe COVID-19, they do not protect against other sarbecoviruses or merbecoviruses. Here, we vaccinate mice with a trivalent sortase-conjugate nanoparticle (scNP) vaccine containing the SARS-CoV-2, RsSHC014, and MERS-CoV receptor-binding domains (RBDs), which elicited live-virus neutralizing antibody responses. The trivalent RBD scNP elicited serum neutralizing antibodies against bat zoonotic Wuhan Institute of Virology-1 (WIV-1)-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 BA.1, SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5, and MERS-CoV live viruses. The monovalent SARS-CoV-2 RBD scNP vaccine only protected against Sarbecovirus challenge, whereas the trivalent RBD scNP vaccine protected against both Merbecovirus and Sarbecovirus challenge in highly pathogenic and lethal mouse models. This study demonstrates proof of concept for a single pan-sarbecovirus/pan-merbecovirus vaccine that protects against three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses spanning two betacoronavirus subgenera.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy compromises genomic stability, often leading to embryo inviability, and is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and aging. Different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries lead to distinct transcriptomic and phenotypic changes, making it helpful to study aneuploidy in tightly controlled genetic backgrounds. By deploying the engineered SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP-mediated evolution) system to the newly synthesized megabase Sc2.0 chromosome VII (synVII), we constructed a synthetic disomic yeast and screened hundreds of SCRaMbLEd derivatives with diverse chromosomal rearrangements. Phenotypic characterization and multi-omics analysis revealed that fitness defects associated with aneuploidy could be restored by (1) removing most of the chromosome content or (2) modifying specific regions in the duplicated chromosome. These findings indicate that both chromosome copy number and specific chromosomal regions contribute to the aneuploidy-related phenotypes, and the synthetic chromosome resource opens new paradigms in studying aneuploidy.

Abstract: Summary
We describe construction of the synthetic yeast chromosome XI (synXI) and reveal the effects of redesign at non-coding DNA elements. The 660-kb synthetic yeast genome project (Sc2.0) chromosome was assembled from synthesized DNA fragments before CRISPR-based methods were used in a process of bug discovery, redesign, and chromosome repair, including precise compaction of 200 kb of repeat sequence. Repaired defects were related to poor centromere function and mitochondrial health and were associated with modifications to non-coding regions. As part of the Sc2.0 design, loxPsym sequences for Cre-mediated recombination are inserted between most genes. Using the GAP1 locus from chromosome XI, we show that these sites can facilitate induced extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) formation, allowing direct study of the effects and propagation of these important molecules. Construction and characterization of synXI contributes to our understanding of non-coding DNA elements, provides a useful tool for eccDNA study, and will inform future synthetic genome design.

Abstract: Summary
The enzymatic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain is essential for viral propagation, with three distinct activities associated with modification of the nsp9 N terminus, NMPylation, RNAylation, and deRNAylation/capping via a GDP-polyribonucleotidyltransferase reaction. The latter two activities comprise an unconventional mechanism for initiating viral RNA 5′ cap formation, while the role of NMPylation is unclear. The structural mechanisms for these diverse enzymatic activities have not been properly delineated. Here, we determine high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of catalytic intermediates for the NMPylation and deRNAylation/capping reactions, revealing diverse nucleotide binding poses and divalent metal ion coordination sites to promote its repertoire of activities. The deRNAylation/capping structure explains why GDP is a preferred substrate for the capping reaction over GTP. Altogether, these findings enhance our understanding of the promiscuous coronaviral NiRAN domain, a therapeutic target, and provide an accurate structural platform for drug development.

Abstract: Summary
While anti-CD47 antibodies hold promise for cancer immunotherapy, early-phase clinical trials have shown limited clinical benefit, suggesting that CD47 blockade alone might be insufficient for effective tumor control. Here, we investigate the contributions of the Fc domain of anti-CD47 antibodies required for optimal in vivo antitumor activity across multiple species-matched models, providing insights into the mechanisms behind the efficacy of this emerging class of therapeutic antibodies. Using a mouse model humanized for CD47, SIRPα, and FcγRs, we demonstrate that local administration of Fc-engineered anti-CD47 antibodies with enhanced binding to activating FcγRs promotes tumor infiltration of macrophages and antigen-specific T cells, while depleting regulatory T cells. These effects result in improved long-term systemic antitumor immunity and minimal on-target off-tumor toxicity. Our results highlight the importance of Fc optimization in the development of effective anti-CD47 therapies and provide an attractive strategy to enhance the activity of this promising immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Attention-based models trained on protein sequences have demonstrated incredible success at classification and generation tasks relevant for artificial-intelligence-driven protein design. However, we lack a sufficient understanding of how very large-scale models and data play a role in effective protein model development. We introduce a suite of protein language models, named ProGen2, that are scaled up to 6.4B parameters and trained on different sequence datasets drawn from over a billion proteins from genomic, metagenomic, and immune repertoire databases. ProGen2 models show state-of-the-art performance in capturing the distribution of observed evolutionary sequences, generating novel viable sequences, and predicting protein fitness without additional fine-tuning. As large model sizes and raw numbers of protein sequences continue to become more widely accessible, our results suggest that a growing emphasis needs to be placed on the data distribution provided to a protein sequence model. Our models and code are open sourced for widespread adoption in protein engineering. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea are necrotrophic plant-pathogenic fungi, causing substantial economic losses on many crops. So far, resistant cultivars against these pathogens are unavailable in most crops. Here, we show that the serine protease CmSp1 of Coniothyrium minitans, a well-characterized mycoparasite of S. sclerotiorum, contributed to suppressing the petal-mediated infection by S. sclerotiorum in rapeseed. Application of recombinant CmSp1 proteins facilitates the bulk degradation of S. sclerotiorum proteins and inhibits spore germination and hyphal growth of S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea, thereby preventing the development of both diseases. Stable transgenic rapeseed plants with tissue-specific expression of CmSp1 in flower petals inhibit the petal-mediated infection by both S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea, and resulting transgenic plants have no adverse effect on other agronomic traits. Thus, our findings provide a novel mechanism by which a mycoparasite inhibits fungal pathogens and an environmentally friendly disease management strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic heterogeneity in monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders can arise from differential severity of variants underlying disease, but how distinct alleles drive variable disease presentation is not well understood. Here, we investigate missense mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), a DNA methyltransferase associated with overgrowth, intellectual disability, and autism, to uncover molecular correlates of phenotypic heterogeneity. We generate a Dnmt3aP900L/+ mouse mimicking a mutation with mild to moderate severity and compare phenotypic and epigenomic effects with a severe R878H mutation. P900L mutants exhibit core growth and behavioral phenotypes shared across models but show subtle epigenomic changes, while R878H mutants display extensive disruptions. We identify mutation-specific dysregulated genes that may contribute to variable disease severity. Shared transcriptomic disruption identified across mutations overlaps dysregulation observed in other developmental disorder models and likely drives common phenotypes. Together, our findings define central drivers of DNMT3A disorders and illustrate how variable epigenomic disruption contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental disease.

Abstract: Summary
Industrialization has transformed the gut microbiota, reducing the prevalence of Prevotella relative to Bacteroides. Here, we isolate Bacteroides and Prevotella strains from the microbiota of Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, a population with high levels of Prevotella. We demonstrate that plant-derived microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are required for persistence of Prevotella copri but not Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in vivo. Differences in carbohydrate metabolism gene content, expression, and in vitro growth reveal that Hadza Prevotella strains specialize in degrading plant carbohydrates, while Hadza Bacteroides isolates use both plant and host-derived carbohydrates, a difference mirrored in Bacteroides from non-Hadza populations. When competing directly, P. copri requires plant-derived MACs to maintain colonization in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron, as a no-MAC diet eliminates P. copri colonization. Prevotella’s reliance on plant-derived MACs and Bacteroides’ ability to use host mucus carbohydrates could explain the reduced prevalence of Prevotella in populations consuming a low-MAC, industrialized diet.

Abstract: Summary
IGHV3-33-encoded antibodies are prevalent in the human humoral response against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Among VH3-33 antibodies, cross-reactivity between PfCSP major repeat (NANP), minor (NVDP), and junctional (NPDP) motifs is associated with high affinity and potent parasite inhibition. However, the molecular basis of antibody cross-reactivity and the relationship with efficacy remain unresolved. Here, we perform an extensive structure-function characterization of 12 VH3-33 anti-PfCSP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with varying degrees of cross-reactivity induced by immunization of mice expressing a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire. We identify residues in the antibody paratope that mediate cross-reactive binding and delineate four distinct epitope conformations induced by antibody binding, with one consistently associated with high protective efficacy and another that confers comparably potent inhibition of parasite liver invasion. Our data show a link between molecular features of cross-reactive VH3-33 mAb binding to PfCSP and mAb potency, relevant for the development of antibody-based interventions against malaria.

Abstract: Summary
The study of fallopian tube (FT) function in health and disease has been hampered by limited knowledge of FT stem cells and lack of in vitro models of stem cell renewal and differentiation. Using optimized organoid culture conditions to address these limitations, we find that FT stem cell renewal is highly dependent on WNT/β-catenin signaling and engineer endogenous WNT/β-catenin signaling reporter organoids to biomark, isolate, and characterize these cells. Using functional approaches, as well as bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses, we show that an endogenous hormonally regulated WNT7A-FZD5 signaling axis is critical for stem cell renewal and that WNT/β-catenin pathway-activated cells form a distinct transcriptomic cluster of FT cells enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and integrin signaling pathways. Overall, we provide a deep characterization of FT stem cells and their molecular requirements for self-renewal, paving the way for mechanistic work investigating the role of stem cells in FT health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
During metastasis, tumor cells invade through the basement membrane and intravasate into blood vessels and then extravasate into distant organs to establish metastases. Here, we report a critical role of a transmembrane serine protease fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in tumor metastasis. Expression of FAP and TWIST1, a metastasis driver, is significantly correlated in several types of human carcinomas, and FAP is required for TWIST1-induced breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Mechanistically, FAP is localized at invadopodia and required for invadopodia-mediated extracellular matrix degradation independent of its proteolytic activity. Live cell imaging shows that association of invadopodia precursors with FAP at the cell membrane promotes the stabilization and growth of invadopodia precursors into mature invadopodia. Together, our study identified FAP as a functional target of TWIST1 in driving tumor metastasis via promoting invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation and uncovered a proteolytic activity-independent role of FAP in stabilizing invadopodia precursors for maturation.

Abstract: Background
Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is a bioactive extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza with the ability to ameliorate amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms of this action have not been elucidated. Herein, we aimed to investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of SalB is attributable to the modulation of microglial polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation.
Methods
Based on the TMT-labeled proteomics analysis, immunofluorescence, western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were employed to investigate the effects of SalB on neuroinflammation in Aβ1–42-stimulated BV2 microglia cells.
Results
At the proteomic level, a total of 6631 proteins were quantified, and of these, 104 were significantly influenced under Aβ1–42 treatment. The expression of 36 Aβ1–42-induced differentially expressed proteins were significantly recovered by SalB treatment (13 upregulated and 23 downregulated). NLRP3 was significantly recovered and was identified as one of the hub proteins. Consistent with the result of the proteomic analysis, western blot and qRT-PCR demonstrated that SalB reduced Aβ1–42-induced NLRP3 upregulation at both the protein and mRNA levels. In addition, SalB significantly blocked M1 microglia polarization, enhanced M2 microglial polarization, and inhibited the production of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β in BV2 microglia cells.
Conclusion
our study demonstrated, for the first time, that the anti-inflammatory effects of SalB were mediated by the regulation of NLRP3 activation and promotion of microglial M2 polarization, indicating the potential of SalB as a novel therapeutic candidate for AD.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining cellular viability relies on the integrity of the plasma membrane, which must be repaired upon damage. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion is a crucial mechanism involved in membrane repair. In C. elegans epidermal cell hyp 7, syntaxin-2 (SYX-2) facilitates large membrane wound repair; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that SNAP-25 protein RIC-4 and synaptobrevin protein SEC-22 are required for SYX-2 recruitment at the wound site. They interact to form a SNARE complex to promote membrane repair in vivo and fusion in vitro. Moreover, we found that SEC-22 localized in multiple intracellular compartments, including endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, which recruited to the wounds. Furthermore, inhibition of RAB-5 disrupted SEC-22 localization and prevented its interaction with SYX-2. Our findings suggest that RAB-5 facilitates the formation of the RIC-4/SEC-22/SYX-2 SNARE complex and provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of how cells repair large membrane wounds.

Abstract: Summary
We developed a detailed model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits, including primary auditory cortex (A1), medial geniculate body (MGB), and thalamic reticular nucleus, utilizing the NEURON simulator and NetPyNE tool. The A1 model simulates a cortical column with over 12,000 neurons and 25 million synapses, incorporating data on cell-type-specific neuron densities, morphology, and connectivity across six cortical layers. It is reciprocally connected to the MGB thalamus, which includes interneurons and core and matrix-layer-specific projections to A1. The model simulates multiscale measures, including physiological firing rates, local field potentials (LFPs), current source densities (CSDs), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Laminar CSD patterns, during spontaneous activity and in response to broadband noise stimulus trains, mirror experimental findings. Physiological oscillations emerge spontaneously across frequency bands comparable to those recorded in vivo. We elucidate population-specific contributions to observed oscillation events and relate them to firing and presynaptic input patterns. The model offers a quantitative theoretical framework to integrate and interpret experimental data and predict its underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Strain-level variation in Staphylococcus aureus is a factor that contributes to disease burden and clinical outcomes in skin disorders and chronic wounds. However, the microbial mechanisms that drive these variable host responses are poorly understood. To identify mechanisms underlying strain-specific outcomes, we perform high-throughput phenotyping screens on S. aureus isolates cultured from diabetic foot ulcers. Isolates from non-healing wounds produce more staphyloxanthin, a cell membrane pigment. In murine diabetic wounds, staphyloxanthin-producing isolates delay wound closure significantly compared with staphyloxanthin-deficient isolates. Staphyloxanthin promotes resistance to oxidative stress and enhances bacterial survival in neutrophils. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of genetically similar clinical isolates with disparate staphyloxanthin phenotypes reveals a mutation in the sigma B operon, resulting in marked differences in stress response gene expression. Our work illustrates a framework to identify traits that underlie strain-level variation in disease burden and suggests more precise targets for therapeutic intervention in S. aureus-positive wounds.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid metabolism has been actively investigated as a potential target for antitumor therapy, but how it may alter the response to genotoxic chemotherapy remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the depletion of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of tyrosine catabolism, reduced chemosensitivity in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The expression level of FAH correlated significantly with chemotherapy efficacy in patients with EOC. Mechanistically, under genotoxic chemotherapy, FAH is oxidized at Met308 and translocates to the nucleus, where FAH-mediated tyrosine catabolism predominantly supplies fumarate. FAH-produced fumarate binds directly to REV1, resulting in the suppression of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and improved chemosensitivity. Furthermore, in vivo tyrosine supplementation improves sensitivity to genotoxic chemotherapeutics and reduces the occurrence of therapy resistance. Our findings reveal a unique role for tyrosine-derived fumarate in the regulation of TLS and may be exploited to improve genotoxic chemotherapy through dietary tyrosine supplementation.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we investigate the interplay between taste perception and macronutrients. While sugar’s and protein’s self-regulation of taste perception is known, the role of fat remains unclear. We reveal that in Drosophila, fat overconsumption reduces fatty acid taste in favor of sweet perception. Conversely, sugar intake increases fatty acid perception and suppresses sweet taste. Genetic investigations show that the sugar signal, gut-secreted Hedgehog, suppresses sugar taste and enhances fatty acid perception. Fat overconsumption induces unpaired 2 (Upd2) secretion from adipose tissue to the hemolymph. We reveal taste neurons take up Upd2, which triggers Domeless suppression of fatty acid perception. We further show that the downstream JAK/STAT signaling enhances sweet perception and, via Socs36E, fine-tunes Domeless activity and the fatty acid taste perception. Together, our results show that sugar regulates Hedgehog signaling and fat induces Upd2 signaling to balance nutrient intake and to regulate sweet and fat taste perception.

Abstract: Summary
Discovery and optimization of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic applications relies on large sequence libraries but is hindered by developability issues such as low solubility, high aggregation, and high immunogenicity. Generative language models, trained on millions of protein sequences, are a powerful tool for the on-demand generation of realistic, diverse sequences. We present the Immunoglobulin Language Model (IgLM), a deep generative language model for creating synthetic antibody libraries. Compared with prior methods that leverage unidirectional context for sequence generation, IgLM formulates antibody design based on text-infilling in natural language, allowing it to re-design variable-length spans within antibody sequences using bidirectional context. We trained IgLM on 558 million (M) antibody heavy- and light-chain variable sequences, conditioning on each sequence’s chain type and species of origin. We demonstrate that IgLM can generate full-length antibody sequences from a variety of species and its infilling formulation allows it to generate infilled complementarity-determining region (CDR) loop libraries with improved in silico developability profiles. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous variants associated with polygenic traits and diseases. However, with few exceptions, a mechanistic understanding of which variants affect which genes in which tissues to modulate trait variation is lacking. Here, we present genomic analyses to explain trait heritability of blood pressure (BP) through the genetics of transcriptional regulation using GWASs, multiomics data from different tissues, and machine learning approaches. Approximately 500,000 predicted regulatory variants across four tissues explain 33.4% of variant heritability: 2.5%, 5.3%, 7.7%, and 11.8% for kidney-, adrenal-, heart-, and artery-specific variants, respectively. Variation in the enhancers involved shows greater tissue specificity than in the genes they regulate, suggesting that gene regulatory networks perturbed by enhancer variants in a tissue relevant to a phenotype are the major source of interindividual variation in BP. Thus, our study provides an approach to scan human tissue and cell types for their physiological contribution to any trait.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal colonization by antigenically foreign microbes necessitates expanded peripheral immune tolerance. Here we show commensal microbiota prime expansion of CD4 T cells unified by the Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) transcriptional regulator and an essential role for KLF2+ CD4 cells in averting microbiota-driven intestinal inflammation. CD4 cells with commensal specificity in secondary lymphoid organs and intestinal tissues are enriched for KLF2 expression, and distinct from FOXP3+ regulatory T cells or other differentiation lineages. Mice with conditional KLF2 deficiency in T cells develop spontaneous rectal prolapse and intestinal inflammation, phenotypes overturned by eliminating microbiota or reconstituting with donor KLF2+ cells. Activated KLF2+ cells selectively produce IL-10, and eliminating IL-10 overrides their suppressive function in vitro and protection against intestinal inflammation in vivo. Together with reduced KLF2+ CD4 cell accumulation in Crohn’s disease, a necessity for the KLF2+ subpopulation of T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells in sustaining commensal tolerance is demonstrated.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor combinations play a key role in shaping cellular identity. However, the precise relationship between specific combinations and downstream effects remains elusive. Here, we investigate this relationship within the context of the Drosophila eve locus, which is controlled by gap genes. We measure spatiotemporal levels of four gap genes in heterozygous and homozygous gap mutant embryos and correlate them with the striped eve activity pattern. Although changes in gap gene expression extend beyond the manipulated gene, the spatial patterns of Eve expression closely mirror canonical activation levels in wild type. Interestingly, some combinations deviate from the wild-type repertoire but still drive eve activation. Although in homozygous mutants some Eve stripes exhibit partial penetrance, stripes consistently emerge at reproducible positions, even with varying gap gene levels. Our findings suggest a robust molecular canalization of cell fates in gap mutants and provide insights into the regulatory constraints governing multi-enhancer gene loci.

Abstract: Summary
The aggressiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is affected by the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, to recapitulate the PDAC TME ex vivo, we cocultured patient-derived PDAC cells with mesenchymal and vascular endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to create a fused pancreatic cancer organoid (FPCO) in an air-liquid interface. FPCOs were further induced to resemble two distinct aspects of PDAC tissue. Quiescent FPCOs were drug resistant, likely because the TME consisted of abundant extracellular matrix proteins that were secreted from the various types of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from hiPSCs. Proliferative FPCOs could re-proliferate after anticancer drug treatment, suggesting that this type of FPCO would be useful for studying PDAC recurrence. Thus, we generated PDAC organoids that recapitulate the heterogeneity of PDAC tissue and are a potential platform for screening anticancer drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the cell biological mechanisms that enable tumor cells to persist after therapy is necessary to improve the treatment of recurrent disease. Here, we demonstrate that transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6), a channel that mediates calcium entry, contributes to the properties of breast cancer stem cells, including resistance to chemotherapy, and that tumor cells that persist after therapy are dependent on TRPC6. The mechanism involves the ability of TRPC6 to regulate integrin α6 mRNA splicing. Specifically, TRPC6-mediated calcium entry represses the epithelial splicing factor ESRP1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1), which enables expression of the integrin α6B splice variant. TRPC6 and α6B function in tandem to facilitate stemness and persistence by activating TAZ and, consequently, repressing Myc. Therapeutic inhibition of TRPC6 sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and tumors to chemotherapy by targeting the splicing of α6 integrin mRNA and inducing Myc. These data reveal a Ca2+-dependent mechanism of chemotherapy-induced persistence, which is amenable to therapy, that involves integrin mRNA splicing.
Keywords: chemoresistance, breast cancer, calcium signaling, mRNA splicing, integrins.

Abstract: Summary
Lung cancer treatment has benefited greatly through advancements in immunotherapies. However, immunotherapy often fails in patients with specific mutations like KEAP1, which are frequently found in lung adenocarcinoma. We established an antigenic lung cancer model and used it to explore how Keap1 mutations remodel the tumor immune microenvironment. Using single-cell technology and depletion studies, we demonstrate that Keap1-mutant tumors diminish dendritic cell and T cell responses driving immunotherapy resistance. This observation was corroborated in patient samples. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene targeting revealed that hyperactivation of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway is responsible for diminished immune responses in Keap1-mutant tumors. Importantly, we demonstrate that combining glutaminase inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade can reverse immunosuppression, making Keap1-mutant tumors susceptible to immunotherapy. Our study provides new insight into the role of KEAP1 mutations in immune evasion, paving the way for novel immune-based therapeutic strategies for KEAP1-mutant cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Short polypeptides encoded by small open reading frames (smORFs) are ubiquitously found in eukaryotic genomes and are important regulators of physiology, development, and mitochondrial processes. Here, we focus on a subset of 298 smORFs that are evolutionarily conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and humans. Many of these smORFs are conserved broadly in the bilaterian lineage, and ∼182 are conserved in plants. We observe remarkably heterogeneous spatial and temporal expression patterns of smORF transcripts—indicating wide-spread tissue-specific and stage-specific mitochondrial architectures. In addition, an analysis of annotated functional domains reveals a predicted enrichment of smORF polypeptides localizing to mitochondria. We conduct an embryonic ribosome profiling experiment and find support for translation of 137 of these smORFs during embryogenesis. We further embark on functional characterization using CRISPR knockout/activation, RNAi knockdown, and cDNA overexpression, revealing diverse phenotypes. This study underscores the importance of identifying smORF function in disease and phenotypic diversity.

Abstract: Summary
Histones shape chromatin structure and the epigenetic landscape. H1, the most diverse histone in the human genome, has 11 variants. Due to the high structural similarity between the H1s, their unique functions in transferring information from the chromatin to mRNA-processing machineries have remained elusive. Here, we generated human cell lines lacking up to five H1 subtypes, allowing us to characterize the genomic binding profiles of six H1 variants. Most H1s bind to specific sites, and binding depends on multiple factors, including GC content. The highly expressed H1.2 has a high affinity for exons, whereas H1.3 binds intronic sequences. H1s are major splicing regulators, especially of exon skipping and intron retention events, through their effects on the elongation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Thus, H1 variants determine splicing fate by modulating RNAPII elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of cues originating from skeletal muscle that govern bone formation is essential for understanding the crosstalk between muscle and bone and for developing therapies for degenerative bone diseases. Here, we identified that skeletal muscle secreted multiple extracellular vesicles (Mu-EVs). These Mu-EVs traveled through the bloodstream to reach bone, where they were phagocytized by bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs). Mu-EVs promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and protected against disuse osteoporosis in mice. The quantity and bioactivity of Mu-EVs were tightly correlated with the function of skeletal muscle. Proteomic analysis revealed numerous proteins in Mu-EVs, some potentially regulating bone metabolism, especially glycolysis. Subsequent investigations indicated that Mu-EVs promoted the glycolysis of BMSCs by delivering lactate dehydrogenase A into these cells. In summary, these findings reveal that Mu-EVs play a vital role in BMSC metabolism regulation and bone formation stimulation, offering a promising approach for treating disuse osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial ribonucleoprotein bodies (BR-bodies) are non-membrane-bound structures that facilitate mRNA decay by concentrating mRNA substrates with RNase E and the associated RNA degradosome machinery. However, the full complement of proteins enriched in BR-bodies has not been defined. Here, we define the protein components of BR-bodies through enrichment of the bodies followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. We find 111 BR-body-enriched proteins showing that BR-bodies are more complex than previously assumed. We identify five BR-body-enriched proteins that undergo RNA-dependent phase separation in vitro with a complex network of condensate mixing. We observe that some RNP condensates co-assemble with preferred directionality, suggesting that RNA may be trafficked through RNP condensates in an ordered manner to facilitate mRNA processing/decay, and that some BR-body-associated proteins have the capacity to dissolve the condensate. Altogether, these results suggest that a complex network of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions controls BR-body phase separation and RNA processing.

Abstract: Salivary glands are highly responsible for maintaining oral tissue homeostasis by secreting saliva. This study was designed to investigate aquaporin 1 and 4, oxidative stress, and autophagy in submandibular and parotid salivary glands of diabetic rats and the possible ameliorative effect of intermittent fasting on these changes. Fifty adult male rats were divided into control and experimental groups. Experimental diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. After induction of diabetics, the experimental group was divided into two groups (diabetic without intermittent fasting and diabetic with intermittent fasting). The animals were sacrificed two and four weeks after induction of diabetes. Intermittent fasting significantly decreased malondialdehyde and significantly elevated reduced glutathione (GSH) in the submandibular and parotid glands compared to those of diabetic rats. The salivary secretions were also significantly histologically spared in diabetics with intermittent fasting groups. Furthermore, intermittent fasting increased aquaporin 1 in both glands, while aquaporin 4 was only elevated in the submandibular gland. The immunolocalization and gene expression of Lc3-II was higher in the diabetic salivary glands than in the fasting glands. In conclusion, these findings highlight the pathological role of autophagy in diabetic submandibular and parotid glands and provide potential target for the therapeutic role of intermittent fasting to ameliorate the dysfunction of the submandibular and parotid glands in type I diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Summary
Human pancreatic plasticity is implied from multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies. However, these have been invariably based on static datasets from which fate trajectories can only be inferred using pseudotemporal estimations. Furthermore, the analysis of isolated islets has resulted in a drastic underrepresentation of other cell types, hindering our ability to interrogate exocrine-endocrine interactions. The long-term culture of human pancreatic slices (HPSs) has presented the field with an opportunity to dynamically track tissue plasticity at the single-cell level. Combining datasets from same-donor HPSs at different time points, with or without a known regenerative stimulus (BMP signaling), led to integrated single-cell datasets storing true temporal or treatment-dependent information. This integration revealed population shifts consistent with ductal progenitor activation, blurring of ductal/acinar boundaries, formation of ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axes, and detection of transitional insulin-producing cells. This study provides the first longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of whole human pancreatic tissue, confirming its plasticity in a dynamic fashion.

Abstract: Summary
Erythro-myeloid progenitors of the yolk sac that originates during early embryo development has been suggested to generate tissue-resident macrophage, mast cell, and even endothelial cell populations from fetal to adult stages. However, the heterogeneity of erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) is not well characterized. Here, we adapt single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the heterogeneity of EMPs and establish several fate-mapping tools for each EMP subset to trace the contributions of different EMP subsets. We identify two primitive and one definitive EMP subsets from the yolk sac. In addition, we find that primitive EMPs are decoupled from definitive EMPs. Furthermore, we confirm that primitive and definitive EMPs give rise to microglia and other tissue-resident macrophages, respectively. In contrast, only Kit+ Csf1r− primitive EMPs generate endothelial cells transiently during early embryo development. Overall, our results delineate the contribution of yolk sac EMPs more clearly based on the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-guided fate-mapping toolkit.

Abstract: This study investigated the protective activities of pinostrobin (PIN) against methotrexate (MTX)-induced ovarian toxicity. Female rats were administered with PIN (50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks, while MTX was administered from weeks 2–4 of PIN treatment. Serum hormonal profiles, ovarian oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic biomarkers as well as ovarian histomorphometry were evaluated. MTX administration elicited profound deficit in serum progesterone and estrogen (E2) levels, while luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were significantly increased. Additionally, MTX administration was associated with significant increases in ovarian malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, NF-кB, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS and caspase-3 activity, as well as notable reduction in the activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase as well as the level of glutathione. Whereas, treatment with PIN significantly decreased serum levels of FSH and LH, as well as ovarian levels of NO, MDA, caspase 3, NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS. PIN also significantly upregulated GSH, GPx, CAT and SOD in the ovarian tissues as well as increased serum E2 and progesterone levels compared to the MTX group. Furthermore, PIN significantly restored altered ovarian histoarchitecture in the treated group. These findings suggests that PIN exerts protective effects against MTX-triggered ovarian damages.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with no targeted therapeutics. The luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype constitutes 15% of TNBC and is enriched for androgen receptor (AR) and AR target genes. Here, we show that a cohort of TNBC not only expresses AR at a much higher rate (∼80%) but also expresses AR splice variants (AR-SVs) (∼20%), further subclassifying LAR-TNBC. Higher AR and AR-SV expression and corresponding aggressive phenotypes are observed predominantly in specimens obtained from African American women. LAR TNBC specimens are enriched for interferon, Janus kinase (JAK)-signal activator and transducer (STAT), and androgen signaling pathways, which are exclusive to AR-expressing epithelial cancer cells. AR- and AR-SV-expressing TNBC cell proliferation and xenograft and patient-tumor explant growth are inhibited by AR N-terminal domain-binding selective AR degrader or by a JAK inhibitor. Biochemical analysis suggests that STAT1 is an AR coactivator. Collectively, our work identifies pharmacologically targetable TNBC subtypes and identifies growth-promoting interaction between AR and JAK-STAT signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is critical for behavioral control; its dysregulation consequently correlated with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the STN successfully alleviates parkinsonian motor symptoms. However, low mood and depression are affective side effects. STN is adjoined with para-STN, associated with appetitive and aversive behavior. DBS aimed at STN might unintentionally modulate para-STN, causing aversion. Alternatively, the STN mediates aversion. To investigate causality between STN and aversion, affective behavior is addressed using optogenetics in mice. Selective promoters allow dissociation of STN (e.g., Pitx2) vs. para-STN (Tac1). Acute photostimulation results in aversion via both STN and para-STN. However, only STN stimulation-paired cues cause conditioned avoidance and only STN stimulation interrupts on-going sugar self-administration. Electrophysiological recordings identify post-synaptic responses in pallidal neurons, and selective photostimulation of STN terminals in the ventral pallidum replicates STN-induced aversion. Identifying STN as a source of aversive learning contributes neurobiological underpinnings to emotional affect.

Abstract: Summary
Methionine is an essential branch of diverse nutrient inputs that dictate mTORC1 activation. In the absence of methionine, SAMTOR binds to GATOR1 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. However, how mTORC1 is activated upon methionine stimulation remains largely elusive. Here, we report that PRMT1 senses methionine/SAM by utilizing SAM as a cofactor for an enzymatic activity-based regulation of mTORC1 signaling. Under methionine-sufficient conditions, elevated cytosolic SAM releases SAMTOR from GATOR1, which confers the association of PRMT1 with GATOR1. Subsequently, SAM-loaded PRMT1 methylates NPRL2, the catalytic subunit of GATOR1, thereby suppressing its GAP activity and leading to mTORC1 activation. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 impedes hepatic methionine sensing by mTORC1 and improves insulin sensitivity in aged mice, establishing the role of PRMT1-mediated methionine sensing at physiological levels. Thus, PRMT1 coordinates with SAMTOR to form the methionine-sensing apparatus of mTORC1 signaling.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumor with extremely high mortality. Uroplakin1B (UPK1B) promotes the occurrence and development of multiple types of cancer by enhancing the expression of c-myc and Sox4. However, whether UPK1B can modulate the development of NSCLC by regulating c-myc/Sox4 axis is unclear. In this study, UPK1B was overexpressed or knocked down in the non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs) were. Next, the proliferation and invasion of those cells were detected with the EdU staining and transwell assays. Sphere formation assays was performed to examine the stem cell characteristics of those cells. Then, we overexpressed the Sox4 in UPK1B knockdown cells and determined the proliferation and invasion of those cells. Our results showed that UPK1B promoted the proliferation, invasion and stem cell characteristics of NSCLCs. In addition, UPK1B enhanced the expression of c-myc, Sox4 and stem cell associated proteins in those cells. Overexpression of Sox4 rescued the proliferation and invasion of NSCLCs, which were suppressed by the UPK1B knockdown. In summary, our study suggested that UPK1B enhanced the invasiveness and stem cell characteristics of NSCLCs by activating c-myc/UPK1B axis.

Here, we show that TmaR assembles by phase separation (PS) via heterotypic interactions with RNA in vivo and in vitro. An unbiased automated mutant screen combined with directed mutagenesis and genetic manipulations uncovered the importance of a predicted nucleic-acid-binding domain, a disordered region, and charged patches, one containing the phosphorylated tyrosine, for TmaR condensation. We demonstrate that, by protecting flagella-related transcripts, TmaR controls flagella production and, thus, cell motility and biofilm formation. These results connect PS in bacteria to survival and provide an explanation for the linkage between metabolism and motility. Intriguingly, a point mutation or increase in its cellular concentration induces irreversible liquid-to-solid transition of TmaR, similar to human disease-causing proteins, which affects cell morphology and division.
