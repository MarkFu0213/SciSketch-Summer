Abstract: Summary
RIG-I, a virus sensor that triggers innate antiviral response, is a DExD/H box RNA helicase bearing structural similarity with Dicer, an RNase III-type nuclease that mediates RNA interference. Dicer requires double-stranded RNA-binding protein partners, such as PACT, for optimal activity. Here we show that PACT physically binds to the C-terminal repression domain of RIG-I and potently stimulates RIG-I-induced type I interferon production. PACT potentiates the activation of RIG-I by poly(I:C) of intermediate length. PACT also cooperates with RIG-I to sustain the activation of antiviral defense. Depletion of PACT substantially attenuates viral induction of interferons. The activation of RIG-I by PACT does not require double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase or Dicer, but is mediated by a direct interaction that leads to stimulation of its ATPase activity. Our findings reveal PACT as an important component in initiating and sustaining the RIG-I-dependent antiviral response.

Abstract: Diapause-destined embryos of the crustacean, Artemia franciscana, accumulate large amounts of an oligomeric, heat-stable, molecular chaperone termed artemin, a cysteine-enriched ferritin homologue. In this study, cysteines 22, 61, 166, and 172 of artemin were substituted with alanines, respectively yielding ArtC22A, ArtC61A, ArtC166A, and ArtC172A. Wild-type and modified artemins were synthesized in transformed bacteria and purified. As measured by heat-induced denaturation of citrate synthase in vitro, each substitution reduced chaperone activity, with ArtC172A the least active. Protein modeling indicated that C172 is close to a region of surface hydrophobicity, also present in ferritin, suggesting that this site contributes to chaperone activity. Only slight differences in oligomer molecular mass were apparent between artemin variants, but ArtC22A and ArtC61A displayed significantly reduced thermostability, perhaps due to the disruption of an inter-subunit disulphide bridge. In contrast, ArtC172A was thermostable, reflecting the location of C172 on the oligomer surface and that it contributes minimally to artemin stabilization. To our knowledge, this is the initial study of structure/function relationships within a ferritin homologue of importance in diapause and the first to indicate that a defined region of hydrophobicity contributes to artemin and ferritin chaperoning.

Abstract: The question whether epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced receptor endocytosis requires the prior autophosphorylation via the EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase domain has been a matter of long-standing debate. In the airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292, the EGFR kinase domain inhibitor BIBW 2948 BS was found to inhibit both autophosphorylation and subsequent internalization of the endogenous EGFR with similar IC50 values. Applying an ex vivo EGFR internalization assay in a clinical study, the in vivo effect of inhalatively administered BIBW 2948 BS was determined directly at the targeted receptor in airway tissues from COPD patients. In these experiments, the in vivo inhibition of the EGFR kinase domain prevented the EGF-induced internalization of EGFR.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) have applications in understanding cardiac disease pathophysiology, pharmacology, and toxicology. Comprehensive characterization of their basic physiological and pharmacological properties is critical in determining the suitability of ESC-CMs as models of cardiac activity. In this study we use video microscopy and quantitative PCR to investigate the responses of mouse ESC-CMs to adrenoceptor, muscarinic, angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor activation. Isoprenaline (10nM–10μM) increased beating rate and contraction amplitude in all beating bodies (BBs), whereas carbachol (up to 1μM) and the If channel blocker ZD-7288 (10μM) decreased contraction frequency. ET-1 (0.01–100nM) reduced contraction amplitude in all BBs and increased contraction frequency in 50% of BBs; these effects were blocked by the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 (250nM). Ang II (0.01nM–1μM) increased both contraction amplitude (all BBs) and frequency (in 50% of BBs), effects blocked, respectively, by losartan (100nM) and PD123,319 (200nM). These results indicate the presence of functional ETA and both AT1 and AT2 receptors in murine ESC-CMs, but their expression and or activity appears to be evident only in a limited set of BBs.

Abstract: The interaction of annexin A6 (AnxA6) with membrane phospholipids and either specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components or F-actin suggests that it may influence cellular processes associated with rapid plasma membrane reorganization such as cell adhesion and motility. Here, we examined the putative roles of AnxA6 in adhesion-related cellular processes that contribute to breast cancer progression. We show that breast cancer cells secrete annexins via the exosomal pathway and that the secreted annexins are predominantly cell surface-associated. Depletion of AnxA6 in the invasive BT-549 breast cancer cells is accompanied by enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth but cell–cell cohesion, cell adhesion/spreading onto collagen type IV or fetuin-A, cell motility and invasiveness were strongly inhibited. To explain the loss in adhesion/motility, we show that vinculin-based focal adhesions in the AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells are elongated and randomly distributed. These focal contacts are also functionally defective because the activation of focal adhesion kinase and the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway were strongly inhibited while the MAP kinase pathway remained constitutively active. Compared with normal human breast tissues, reduced AnxA6 expression in breast carcinoma tissues correlates with enhanced cell proliferation. Together this suggests that reduced AnxA6 expression contributes to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell–cell and/or cell–ECM contacts and anchorage-independent cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis NB-LRR immune receptor RPM1 recognizes the Pseudomonas syringae type III effectors AvrB or AvrRpm1 to mount an immune response. Although neither effector is itself a kinase, AvrRpm1 and AvrB are known to target Arabidopsis RIN4, a negative regulator of basal plant defense, for phosphorylation. We show that RIN4 phosphorylation activates RPM1. RIN4142-176 is necessary and, with appropriate localization sequences, sufficient to support effector-triggered RPM1 activation, with the threonine residue at position 166 being critical. Phosphomimic substitutions at T166 cause effector-independent RPM1 activation. RIN4 T166 is phosphorylated in vivo in the presence of AvrB or AvrRpm1. RIN4 mutants that lose interaction with AvrB cannot be coimmunoprecipitated with RPM1. This defines a common interaction platform required for RPM1 activation by phosphorylated RIN4 in response to pathogenic effectors. Conservation of an analogous threonine across all RIN4-like proteins suggests a key function for this residue beyond the regulation of RPM1.

Abstract: Background
The authors presented their experience in regenerative surgery of post-traumatic lower extremity ulcers, evaluating the effects related to the use of Enhanced Stromal Vascular Fraction (e-SVF) and Fat Grafting with Platelet rich Plasma (PRP). The authors compared the results of two control groups.
Method
The analysis involved 20 patients aged between 23 to 62years affected by post-traumatic lower extremity ulcers. 10 patients managed with e-SVF and 10 patients managed with Fat grafting+PRP in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Department at “Tor Vergata” University Rome. Patients in the first control group (n=10), were treated only with curettage and application of hyaluronic acid in the bed of ulcers. Patients in the second control group (n=10), were treated only with PRP.
Results
The authors showed that wounds treated with e-SVF healed better than those treated with hyaluronic acid. In fact, after 9.7weeks, patients treated with e-SVF underwent 97.9%±1.5% reepithelialisation compared to 87.8%±4.4% of the first control group (only hyaluronic acid; p<0.05). Patients treated with PRP and fat grafting also showed an improvement in reepithelialisation; in fact after 9.7weeks, they underwent a 97.8%±1.5% reepithelialisation compared to 89.1%±3.8% of the second control group (only PRP; p<0.05). As reported e-SVF and PRP mixed with fat grafting were the two treatments evidencing improvement in the healing of patients post-traumatic extremity ulcers.
Conclusions
The results obtained proved the efficacy of these treatments, and the satisfaction of the patients confirmed the quality of the results.

Abstract: Gap junctions (GJs) play an important role in vascular function, stability, and homeostasis in endothelial cells (ECs), and GJs are comprised of members of the connexin (Cx) family. GJs of vascular ECs are assembled from Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43, and we showed that ECs also express Cx32. In this study, we investigated a potential role for Cx32 during vascular inflammation. Expression of Cx32 mRNA and protein by human umbilical venous ECs (HUVECs) decreased following treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, but lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin (IL)-1β did not affect Cx32 expression. Intracellular transfer of an inhibitory anti-Cx32 monoclonal antibody significantly enhanced TNF-α-induced monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and IL-6 expression, but overexpression of Cx32 abrogated TNF-α-induced MCP-1 and IL-6 expression. LPS treatment of Cx32 knock-out mice significantly increased the serum concentrations of TNF-α, interferon-γ, IL-6 and MCP-1, compared to wild-type littermate mice. These data suggest that Cx32 protects ECs from inflammation by regulating cytokine expression and plays an important role in the maintenance of vascular function.

Abstract: We have previously reported that G-actin accumulation in nuclei is a universal phenomenon of cellular senescence. By employing primary culture of human diploid fibroblast (HDF) and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), we explored whether the failure of actin export to cytoplasm is responsible for actin accumulation in nuclei of senescent cells. Expression of exportin 6 (Exp6) and small G-protein, Ran, was significantly reduced in the replicative senescence, but not yet in SIPS, whereas nuclear import of actin by cofilin was already increased in SIPS. After treatment of young HDF cells with H2O2, rapid reduction of nuclear RanGTP was observed along with cytoplasmic increase of RanGDP. Furthermore, significantly reduced interaction of Exp6 with RanGTP was found by GST-Exp6 pull-down analysis. Failure of RanGTP restoration was accompanied with inhibition of ATP synthesis and NTF2 sequestration in the nuclei along with accordant change of senescence morphology. Indeed, knockdown of Exp6 expression significantly increased actin molecule in the nuclei of young HDF cells. Therefore, actin accumulation in nuclei of senescent cells is most likely due to the failure of RanGTP restoration with ATP deficiency and NTF2 accumulation in nuclei, which result in the decrease of actin export via Exp6 inactivation, in addition to actin import by cofilin activation.

Abstract: Membrane bridges are key cellular structures involved in intercellular communication; however, dynamics for their formation are not well understood. We demonstrated the formation and regulation of novel extracellular ultrathin fibers in NIH3T3 cells using confocal and atomic force microscopy. At adjacent regions of neighboring cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and glucose oxidase induced ultrathin fiber formation, which was prevented by Trolox, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. The height of ROS-sensitive ultrathin fibers ranged from 2 to 4nm. PMA-induced formation of ultrathin fibers was inhibited by cytochalasin D, but not by Taxol or colchicine, indicating that ultrathin fibers mainly comprise microfilaments. PMA-induced ultrathin fibers underwent dynamic structural changes, resulting in formation of intercellular membrane bridges. Thus, these fibers are formed by a mechanism(s) involving ROS and involved in formation of intercellular membrane bridges. Furthermore, ultrastructural imaging of ultrathin fibers may contribute to understanding the diverse mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication and the intercellular transfer of biomolecules, including proteins and cell organelles.

Abstract: Prenylation is a post-translational hydrophobic modification of proteins, important for their membrane localization and biological function. The use of inhibitors of prenylation has proven to be a useful tool in the activation of apoptotic pathways in tumor cell lines. Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGT) is responsible for the prenylation of the Rab family. Overexpression of Rab GGTbeta has been identified in CHOP refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a cell line-based model for CHOP resistant DLBCL, we show that treatment with simvastatin, which inhibits protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, sensitizes DLBCL cells to cytotoxic treatment. Treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 or the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 indicates that the reduction in cell viability was restricted to inhibition of geranylgeranylation. In addition, treatment with BMS1, a combined inhibitor of farnesyl transferase and Rab GGT, resulted in a high cytostatic effect in WSU-NHL cells, demonstrated by reduced cell viability and decreased proliferation. Co-treatment of BMS1 or GGTI-298 with CHOP showed synergistic effects with regard to markers of apoptosis. We propose that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation together with conventional cytostatic therapy is a potential novel strategy for treating patients with CHOP refractory DLBCL.

Abstract: Sphere forming assays have been useful to enrich for stem like cells in a range of tumors. The robustness of this system contrasts the difficulties in defining a stem cell population based on cell surface markers. We have undertaken a study to describe the cellular and organizational composition of tumorspheres, directly comparing these to neurospheres derived from the adult human subventricular zone (SVZ). Primary cell cultures from brain tumors were found to contain variable fractions of cells positive for tumor stem cell markers (CD133 (2–93%)/SSEA1 (3–15%)/CXCR4 (1–72%)). All cultures produced tumors upon xenografting. Tumorspheres contained a heterogeneous population of cells, but were structurally organized with stem cell markers present at the core of spheres, with markers of more mature glial progenitors and astrocytes at more peripheral location. Ultrastructural studies showed that tumorspheres contained a higher fraction of electron dense cells in the core than the periphery (36% and 19%, respectively). Neurospheres also contained a heterogeneous cell population, but did not have an organization similar to tumorspheres. Although tumorspheres clearly display irregular and neoplastic cells, they establish an organized structure with an outward gradient of differentiation. We suggest that this organization is central in maintaining the tumor stem cell pool.

Abstract: Summary
HIV infection is characterized by gradual immune system collapse and hematopoietic dysfunction. We recently showed that HIV enters multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and establishes both active cytotoxic and latent infections that can be reactivated by myeloid differentiation. However, whether these multipotent progenitors include long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that could establish viral reservoirs for the life of the infected person remains unknown. Here we provide direct evidence that HIV targets long-lived HSCs and show that infected HSCs yield stable, multilineage engraftment in a xenograft model. Furthermore, we establish that the capacity to use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 for entry determines whether a virus will enter multipotent versus differentiated progenitor cells. Because HSCs live for the life span of the infected person and are crucial for hematopoietic health, these data may explain the poor prognosis associated with CXCR4-tropic HIV infection and suggest HSCs as long-lived cellular reservoirs of latent HIV.

Abstract: Perturbation of renal tubular antioxidants and overproduction of reactive oxygen species may amplify the proinflammatory state of renal obstruction, culminating in oxidative stress and tubular loss. Here, we analyzed the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) response and the function and signal transduction of NF-E2-related protein 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor on oxidative stress modulation in obstruction. Rats were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction or sham operation and kidneys harvested at 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after obstruction. Hsp70 expression and Nrf2 activity and its downstream target gene products were assessed. After 10 and 14 days of obstruction, enhanced lipid peroxidation through higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels and increased oxidative stress resulted in reduced total antioxidant activity and enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) oxidase activity were demonstrated. This was accompanied by decreased inducible Hsp70 expression and a progressive reduction of nuclear Nrf2 and its target gene products glutathione S-transferase A2 (GSTA2) and NADPH/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), whereas the Nrf2 repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) was upregulated. By contrast, on early obstruction for 7 days, lack of increased oxidative markers associated with higher inducible Hsp70 protein levels and a rapid nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, Keap1 downregulation, and mRNA induction of the identified Nrf2-dependent genes, NQO1 and GSTA2, were shown. For these results, we suggest that the magnitude of cytoprotection in early obstruction depends on the combined contribution of induced activation of Nrf2 upregulating its downstream gene products and Hsp70 response. Impaired ability to mount the biological response to the prevailing oxidative stress leading to renal injury was shown in prolonged obstruction.

Abstract: Summary
The obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis injects numerous effector proteins into the epithelial cell cytoplasm to manipulate host functions important for bacterial survival. In addition, the bacterium secretes a serine protease, chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF). Although several CPAF targets are reported, the significance of CPAF-mediated proteolysis is unclear due to the lack of specific CPAF inhibitors and the diversity of host targets. We report that CPAF also targets chlamydial effectors secreted early during the establishment of the pathogen-containing vacuole (“inclusion”). We designed a cell-permeable CPAF-specific inhibitory peptide and used it to determine that CPAF prevents superinfection by degrading early Chlamydia effectors translocated during entry into a preinfected cell. Prolonged CPAF inhibition leads to loss of inclusion integrity and caspase-1-dependent death of infected epithelial cells. Thus, CPAF functions in niche protection, inclusion integrity and pathogen survival, making the development of CPAF-specific protease inhibitors an attractive antichlamydial therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: The Drosophila gene yuri gagarin is a complex locus encoding three protein isoform classes that are ubiquitously expressed in the organism. Mutations to the gene affect processes as diverse as gravitactic behavior and spermatogenesis. The larger Yuri isoforms contain extensive coiled-coil regions. Our previous studies indicate that one of the large isoform classes (Yuri-65) is required for formation of specialized F-actin-containing structures generated during spermatogenesis, including the so-called actin “cones” that mediate spermatid individualization. We used the tandem affinity purification of a tagged version of Yuri-65 (the TAP-tagging technique) to identify proteins associated with Yuri-65 in the intact organism. Tropomyosin, primarily as the 284-residue isoform derived from the ubiquitously expressed Tropomyosin 1 gene was thus identified as a major Yuri interaction partner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this interaction. We have established that the stable F-actin cones of spermatogenesis contain Tropomyosin 1 (Tm1) and that in mutant yuriF64, failure of F-actin cone formation is associated with failure of Tm1 to accumulate at the cone initiation sites. In investigating possible interactions of Tm1 and Yuri in other tissues, we discovered that Tm1 and Yuri frequently colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum. Tropomyosin has been implicated in actin-mediated membrane trafficking activity in other systems. Our findings suggest that Yuri–Tm1 complexes participate in related functions.

Abstract: Numb is an endocytic adaptor protein that regulates internalization and post-endocytic trafficking of cell surface proteins. In polarized epithelial cells Numb is localized to the basolateral membrane, and recent work has implicated Numb in regulation of cell adhesion and migration, suggesting a role for Numb in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). We depleted MDCK cells of Numb and examined the effects downstream of EMT-promoting stimuli. While knockdown of Numb did not affect apicobasal polarity, we show that depletion of Numb destabilizes E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion and promotes loss of epithelial cell morphology. In addition, Numb knockdown in MDCK cells potentiates HGF-induced lamellipodia formation and cell dispersal. Examination of Rac1-GTP levels in Numb knockdown cells revealed hyperactivation of Rac1 following extracellular calcium depletion and HGF stimulation, which corresponds with enhanced loss of cell adhesions and lamellipodia formation. Furthermore, inhibition of Rac1 in Numb depleted cells stabilized cell–cell contacts following depletion of extracellular calcium. Together, these data indicate that Numb acts to suppress Rac1-GTP accumulation, and its loss leads to increased sensitivity toward extracellular signals that disrupt cell–cell adhesion to induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell dispersal.

Abstract: Products resulting from oxidation of cell membrane phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC) exhibit potent protective effects against lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction caused by pathologically relevant mechanical forces and inflammatory agents. These effects were linked to enhancement of peripheral cytoskeleton and cell adhesion interactions mediated by small GTPase Rac and inhibition of Rho-mediated barrier-disruptive signaling. However, the mechanism of OxPAPC-induced, Rac-dependent Rho downregulation critical for vascular barrier protection remains unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that Rho negative regulator p190RhoGAP is essential for OxPAPC-induced lung barrier protection against ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and investigated potential mechanism of p190RhoGAP targeting to adherens junctions (AJ) via p120-catenin. OxPAPC induced peripheral translocation of p190RhoGAP, which was abolished by knockdown of Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors Tiam1 and Vav2. OxPAPC also induced Rac-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and association of p190RhoGAP with AJ protein p120-catenin. siRNA-induced knockdown of p190RhoGAP attenuated protective effects of OxPAPC against EC barrier compromise induced by thrombin and pathologically relevant cyclic stretch (18% CS). In vivo, p190RhoGAP knockdown significantly attenuated protective effects of OxPAPC against ventilator-induced lung vascular leak, as detected by increased cell count and protein content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tissue neutrophil accumulation in the lung. These results demonstrate for the first time a key role of p190RhoGAP for the vascular endothelial barrier protection in VILI.

Abstract: Several studies suggest that the response to various stressors differs between the sexes. We aimed to study serum HSP70 and levels of oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) as markers of oxidative stress in men and women with type 2 diabetes. We quantified serum HSP70 and levels of ox-LDL in three cohorts; patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, patients with long-standing diabetes and normal controls. The cohort of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes was followed up for 3 months under glucose-lowering therapy with metformin. Our findings showed that serum HSP70 level was increased in women with long-standing diabetes in comparison with men. HSP70 did not decrease after glucose lowering therapy in women with newly diagnosed diabetes, but it did decrease in men. There was no significant difference on ox-LDL between men and women in any of the studied cohorts. It decreased significantly in the cohort of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes after treatment, regardless of sex. There was no significant correlation between HSP70 and ox-LDL in any of the studied cohorts except among normal women. We suggest that diabetes induces an immune response and impairs cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress more commonly in women with type 2 diabetes than in men.

Abstract: Gamma-synuclein is a neuronal protein found in peripheral and motor nerve systems. It becomes highly expressed in metastatic but not in primary tumor or normal tissues. The close association between gamma-synuclein expression and cancer spreading has been demonstrated in a broad range of malignancies. Our previous study showed that exogenous expression of gamma-synuclein in ovarian and breast cancer cells significantly enhanced cell migration and resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptotic death. In our current research, we found that gamma-synuclein can affect microtubule properties and act as a functional microtubule associated protein. In vitro assays revealed that gamma-synuclein can bind and promote tubulin polymerization, induce the microtubule bundling and alter microtubule morphology developed in the presence of microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2). Using cancer cell lysate, gamma-synuclein protein was found to be localized in both cytosolic compartment and extracted cytoskeleton portion. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that gamma-synuclein can colocalize with microtubule in HeLa cells and decrease rigidity of microtubule bundles caused by paclitaxel. In human ovarian cancer epithelial A2780 cells, gamma-synuclein overexpression improved cell adhesion and microtubule structure upon paclitaxel treatment. Importantly, it led to microtubule-dependent mitochondria clustering at perinuclear area. These observations suggest that overexpression of gamma-synuclein may reduce cell chemo-sensitivity of tumor cells through decreasing microtubule rigidity. In summary, our studies suggested that gamma-synuclein can directly participate in microtubule regulation.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) has the property to become translocated from the extracellular space into the cell cytosol and nucleus. Membrane translocation of FGF1 occurs subsequent to endocytic uptake and is strictly FGF-receptor (FGFR) dependent. Here we have investigated the timing of FGF1 translocation in relation to FGFR1 signalling. We found that the translocation of FGF1 is a periodic event that occurs with 24h intervals. Serum-starved cells translocated the growth factor with peak occurrences ~6h, ~30h, and ~54h after the addition of FGF1. The periodic FGF1 translocation was totally independent of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity as it proceeded unchanged when the kinase activity was chemically inhibited or the kinase domain was deleted. Furthermore, FGF1 translocation was not restricted to a particular phase of the cell cycle or dependent on cell cycle progression. The results demonstrate that the FGF1/FGFR1 complex constitutes a signalling module that independently of the receptor tyrosine kinase can convey a signal that initiates a strictly timed and periodic release of endocytosed FGF1 into the cytosol/nucleus.

Abstract: Aerobic lactate production of which the final step is executed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is one of the typical phenotypes in invasive tumor development. However, detailed mechanism of how LDH links to cancer cell invasiveness remains unclear. This study shows that suppressed LDHB expression plays a critical role in hepatoma cell invasiveness by inducing claudin-1 (Cln-1), a tight junction protein, via mitochondrial respiratory defects. First, we found that all the SNU human hepatoma cells with increased glycolytic lactate production have the defective mitochondrial respiratory activity and the Cln-1-mediated high invasive activity. Similar results were also obtained with human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Unexpectedly, the increased lactate production was due to LDH isozyme shifts to LDH5 by LDHB down-expression rather than LDHA induction, implying the importance of LDHB modulation. Second, LDHB knockdown did not only trigger Cln-1 induction at the transcriptional level, but also induced respiratory impairment. Interestingly, most respiratory inhibitors except KCN induced Cln-1 expression although complex I inhibition by rotenone was most effective on Cln-1 induction. Respiratory defect-mediated Cln-1 induction was further confirmed by knockdown of NDUFA9, one of complex I subunits. Finally, ectopic expression of LDHB attenuated the invasiveness of both SNU 354 and 449 cells whereas LDHB knockdown significantly augmented the invasiveness of Chang cells with Cln-1induction. The increased invasive activity by LDHB modulation was clearly reversed by knocking-down Cln-1. Taken together, our results suggest that LDHB suppression plays an important role in triggering or maintaining the mitochondrial defects and then contributes to cancer cell invasiveness by inducing Cln-1 protein.

Abstract: Summary
Enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B (CVB) and poliovirus (PV), can access the CNS through the blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelium to cause aseptic meningitis. To identify cellular components required for CVB and PV infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, an in vitro BBB model, we performed comparative RNAi screens and identified 117 genes that influenced infection. Whereas a large proportion of genes whose depletion enhanced infection (17 of 22) were broadly antienteroviral, only 46 of the 95 genes whose depletion inhibited infection were required by both CVB and PV and included components of cell signaling pathways such as adenylate cyclases. Downregulation of genes including Rab GTPases, Src tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine phosphatases displayed specificity in their requirement for either CVB or PV infection. These findings highlight the pathways hijacked by enteroviruses for entry and replication in the BBB endothelium, a specialized and clinically relevant cell type for these viruses.

Abstract: In response to DNA damage, cells need robust repair mechanisms to complete the cell cycle successfully. Severe forms of DNA damage are repaired by homologous recombination (HR), in which the XRCC2 protein plays a vital role. Cells deficient in XRCC2 also show disruption of the centrosome, a key component of the mitotic apparatus. We find that this centrosome disruption is dynamic and when it occurs during mitosis it is linked directly to the onset of mitotic catastrophe in a significant fraction of the XRCC2-deficient cells. However, we also show for the first time that XRCC2 and other HR proteins, including the key recombinase RAD51, co-localize with the centrosome. Co-localization is maintained throughout the cell cycle, except when cells are finishing mitosis when RAD51 accumulates in the midbody between the separating cells. Taken together, these data suggest a tight functional linkage between the centrosome and HR proteins, potentially to coordinate the deployment of a DNA damage response at vulnerable phases of the cell cycle.

Abstract: Recently, we reported that high soluble Hsp70 (sHsp70) level was a significant predictor of mortality during an almost 3-year-long follow-up period in patients with colorectal cancer. This association was the strongest in the group of <70-year-old female patients as well as in those who were in a less advanced stage of the disease at baseline. According to these observations, measurement of the serum level of sHsp70 is a useful, stage-independent prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, especially in patients without distant metastasis. Since many literature data indicated that measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins (APPs) may also be suitable for predicting the mortality of patients with colorectal cancer, it seemed reasonable to study whether the effect of sHsp70 and other APPs are related or independent. In order to answer this question, we measured the concentrations of CRP as well as of other complement-related APPs (C1 inhibitor, C3, and C9) along with that of the MASP-2 complement component in the sera of 175 patients with colorectal cancer and known levels of sHsp70, which have been used in our previous study. High (above median) levels of CRP, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), and sHsp70 were found to be independently associated with poor patient survival, whereas no such association was observed with the other proteins tested. According to the adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, the additive effect of high sHsp70, CRP, and C1-INH levels on the survival of patients exceeded that of high sHsp70 alone, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.83 (1.13–70.9). In some subgroups of patients, such as in females [HR 4.80 (1.07–21.60)] or in ≤70-year-old patients [HR 11.53 (2.78–47.70)], even greater differences were obtained. These findings indicate that the clinical mortality–prediction value of combined measurements of sHsp70, CRP, and C1-INH with inexpensive methods can be very high, especially in specific subgroups of patients with colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common, and most aggressive primary brain tumor among adults. A vast majority of the tumors express high levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a consequence of gene amplification. Furthermore, gene amplification is often associated with mutation of EGFR, and the constitutive activated deletion variant EGFRvIII is the most common EGFR mutation found in GBM. Activated EGFR signaling, through overexpression and/or mutation, is involved in increased tumorigenic potential. As such, EGFR is an attractive target for GBM therapy. However, clinical studies with EGFR inhibitors have shown inconsistent results, and as such, further knowledge regarding the role of EGFR and EGFRvIII in GBM is needed. For this, an appropriate in vivo/in vitro tumor model is required. Here, we report the establishment of an experimental GBM model in which the expressions of EGFR and EGFRvIII are maintained both in xenograft tumors growing subcutaneously on mice and in cell cultures established in stem cell conditions. With this model it will be possible to further study the role of EGFR and EGFRvIII, and response to targeted therapy, in GBM.

Abstract: Smoking is the leading risk factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Corticosteroids are abundantly used in these patients; however, the interaction of smoking and steroid treatment is not fully understood. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a central role in the maintenance of cell integrity, apoptosis and cellular steroid action. To better understand cigarette smoke-steroid interaction, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or dexamethasone (DEX) on changes of intracellular heat shock protein-72 (Hsp72) in lung cells. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to increasing doses (0; 0.1; 1; and 10 μM/μl) of DEX in the medium in the absence(C) and presence of CSE. Apoptosis, necrosis, Hsp72 messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression of cells were measured, and the role of Hsp72 on steroid effect examined. CSE reduced the number of viable cells by significantly increasing the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells. DEX dose-dependently decreased the ratio of apoptosis when CSE was administered, without change in necrosis. CSE − DEX co-treatment dose-dependently increased Hsp72 mRNA and protein expression, with the highest level measured in CSE + DEX (10) cells, while significantly lower levels were noted in all respective C groups. Pretreatment with Hsp72 silencing RNA confirmed that increased survival observed following DEX administration in CSE-treated cells was mainly mediated via the Hsp72 system. CSE significantly decreases cell survival by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. DEX significantly increases Hsp72 mRNA and protein expression only in the presence of CSE resulting in increased cellular protection and survival. DEX exerts its cell protective effects by decreasing apoptotic cell death via the Hsp72 system in CSE-treated alveolar epithelial cells.

Abstract: The vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) play a significant role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature. Systems biology offers promising approaches to better understand angiogenesis by computational modeling the key molecular interactions in this process. Such modeling requires quantitative knowledge of cell surface density of pro-angiogenic receptors versus anti-angiogenic receptors, their regulation, and their cell-to-cell variability. Using quantitative fluorescence, we systematically characterized the endothelial surface density of VEGFRs and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). We also determined the role of VEGF in regulating the surface density of these receptors. Applying cell-by-cell analysis revealed heterogeneity in receptor surface density and VEGF tuning of this heterogeneity. Altogether, we determine inherent differences in the surface expression levels of these receptors and the role of VEGF in regulating the balance of anti-angiogenic or modulatory (VEGFR1) and pro-angiogenic (VEGFR2) receptors.

Abstract: In B-non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Lyn and Cbp/PAG constitute the core of an oncogenic signalosome that captures the Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, the Spleen tyrosine kinase and the Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 to generate pro-survival and proliferative signals. Lymphoma lines corresponding to follicular, mantle-cell and Burkitt-derived lymphomas display type-specific signalosome organizations that differentially activate PI3K, Syk and STAT3. In the follicular lymphoma line, PI3K, Syk and STAT3 were optimally activated upon association with the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome, while in the Burkitt lymphoma-derived line, the association with Cbp/PAG and activation of PI3K were interfered with by the latent membrane proteins encoded by the Epstein–Barr virus. In the Jeko-1 mantle-cell line, a weak association of Syk with the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome resulted in poor activation of Syk, but in those cells, as in the follicular and Burkitt-derived lines, efficient apoptosis induction by the Syk inhibitor R406 indicated that Syk is nonetheless an important prosurvival element and therefore a valuable therapeutic target. In all configurations described herein is the Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome independent of external signals and provides efficient means of activation for its associated lipid and protein kinases. In follicular and Burkitt-derived lines, Syk appears to be activated following binding to Cbp/PAG and no longer requires B-cell receptor-associated activation motifs for activation. Assessment of the different modalities of Lyn-Cbp/PAG signalosome organization could help in selecting the appropriate combination of kinase inhibitors to eliminate a particular type of lymphoma cells.

Abstract: Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is a tumor suppressor protein that is frequently downregulated in various tumor types. DLC1 contains a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that appears to be required for its tumor suppressive functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate DLC1. By mass spectrometry we have mapped a novel phosphorylation site within the DLC1 GAP domain on serine 807. Using a phospho-S807-specific antibody, our results identify protein kinase D (PKD) to phosphorylate this site in DLC1 in intact cells. Although phosphorylation on serine 807 did not directly impact on in vitro GAP activity, a DLC1 serine-to-alanine exchange mutant inhibited colony formation more potently than the wild type protein. Our results thus show that PKD-mediated phosphorylation of DLC1 on serine 807 negatively regulates DLC1 cellular function.

Abstract: LL-37 is a human cationic host defense peptide (antimicrobial peptide) belonging to the cathelicidin family of peptides. In this study, LL-37 was shown to kill stimulated CD8+ T cells (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CTLs) via apoptosis, while having no cytotoxic effect on non-stimulated CD8+ or CD4+ T cells or stimulated CD4+ T cells. Of interest, the CD8+ cells were much more sensitive to LL-37 than many other cell types. LL-37 exposure resulted in DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and the release of both granzyme A and granzyme B from intracellular granules. The importance of granzyme family members in the apoptosis of CTLs following LL-37 treatment was analyzed by using C57BL/6 lymphocytes obtained from mice that were homozygous for null mutations in the granzyme B gene, the granzyme A gene, or both granzymes A and B. Granzymes A and B were both shown to play an important role in LL-37-induced apoptosis of CTLs. Further analysis revealed that apoptosis occurred primarily through granzyme A-mediated caspase-independent apoptosis. However, caspase-dependent cell death was also observed. This suggests that LL-37 induces apoptosis in CTLs via multiple different mechanisms, initiated by the LL-37-induced leakage of granzymes from cytolytic granules. Our results imply the existence of a novel mechanism of crosstalk between the inflammatory and adaptive immune systems. Cells such as neutrophils, at the site of a tumor for example, could influence the effector, activity of CTL through the secretion of LL-37.

Abstract: Autoimmunity to heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) has been related to atherosclerosis. Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), the most studied infectious agent implicated in promoting atherosclerosis, produces a form of HSP60, which can induce an autoimmune response, due to high antigenic homology with human HSP60 (hHSP60). In this study, we evaluated the correlations among anti-hHSP60 antibodies, CP infection, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a high-risk population, such as patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Thirty-two patients (67.9±13.9 years; male/female, 23:9) on regular HD were enrolled. Global absolute cardiovascular risk (GCR) was assessed using the Italian CUORE Project’s risk charts, which evaluate age, gender, smoking habits, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and serum cholesterol. The occurrence of cardiovascular events during a 24-month follow-up was recorded. Seropositivity to CP and the presence of anti-hHSP60 antibodies were tested by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Inflammation was assessed by measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels. Fifteen healthy sex and age-matched (61.9±9.5 years; male/female, 11:4) subjects were the control group. Fifteen of 32 patients resulted seropositive for CP. CP + patients were older than CP−, while they did not differ for GCR, CRP, and dialytic parameters. CVD incidence was significantly higher in CP+ (9 CP+ vs 2 CP−, p < 0.05). Cox analysis recognized that the incidence of CVD was independently correlated with seropositivity to CP (HR, 7.59; p = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.63–35.4). On the other hand, there were no significant differences in anti-hHSP60 levels among CP+, CP− and healthy subjects: 18.11 μg/mL (14.8–47.8), 31.4 μg/mL (23.2–75.3), and 24.72 μg/mL (17.7–41.1), respectively. Anti-hHSP60 did not correlate to GCR, CRP, and incidence of CVD. In conclusion, our data suggest that anti-hHSP60 autoimmune response is not related to CP infection and CP-related CVD risk in HD patients.

Abstract: The signaling network of protein kinase B(PKB)/Akt has been implicated in survival of lung cancer cells. However, understanding the relative contribution of the different isoform of Akt network is nontrival. Here, we report that Akt2 is highly expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cells. Suppression of Akt2 expression in A549 cells results in notable inhibition of cell poliferation, soft agar growth, and invasion, accompanying by a decrease of nucleophosmin/B23 protein. Overexpression of Akt1 restores cancerous growth of A549 cells in B23-knockdown (KD) cells while Akt2 overexpression did not restore proliferating potential in cells with downregulated B23, thus suggesting Akt2 requires B23 to drive proliferation of lung cancer cell. Loss of functional Akt2 and B23 has similar defects on cell proliferation, apoptotic resistance and cell cycle regulation, while loss of Akt1 has less defects on cell proliferation, survial and cell cycle progression in A549 cells. Moreover, overexpression of B23 rescues the proliferative block induced as a consequence of loss of Akt2. Thus our data suggest that Akt2/B23 functions as an oncogenic unit to drive tumorigenesis of A549 lung cancer cells.

Abstract: Background/aims
By ectopic expression of a distinct combination of transcription factors we aimed to induce a mature hepatocyte phenotype in an adult liver derived progenitor cell population (ALDPC).
Methods
The open reading frames encoding murine Foxa2, Hnf4α and C/ebpα were cloned into lentivirus vectors and sequentially expressed in target cells. After seven days of culture, cells were analysed for expression of liver specific genes, and functional assays were performed. Fresh primary hepatocytes, twenty four hours in culture, served as positive controls.
Results
Untransduced ALDPC under established differentiation conditions exhibited moderate signs of maturation, in particular in comparison with fresh hepatocyte controls. In transcription factor transduced cells, fifteen mRNA´s coding for secreted proteins, cytochrome p450 isoenzymes, liver metabolic enzymes were detected by RT-qPCR at levels close to controls. Albumin secretion increased incrementally in single (Foxa2), double (Foxa2, Hnf4α) and triple-transduced cells (Foxa2, Hnf4α, C/ebpα) and reached levels observed in primary hepatocytes. Glycogen storage as determined by PAS staining was detectable in double and triple transduced cells, comparable to controls. Ureagenesis was also induced in triple transduced cells, but at lower levels compared to primary hepatocytes.
Conclusions
Sequential expression of Foxa2, Hnf4α and C/ebpα induces a mature hepatocyte phenotype in an expandable liver derived progenitor cell line.

Abstract: The Her2 is one of tumor-associated antigens (TAA), regarded as an ideal target of immunotherapy. DNA encoding full-length or truncated rat Her2/neu have shown protective and therapeutics potentials against Her2/neu-expressing mammary tumors. However, the efficacy of active vaccination is limited since Her2 is a self-tolerated antigen. Hence, new strategies are required to enhance both the quality and quantity of the immune response against Her2-expressing tumors. Many studies have used Her2/neu gene with cytokine or other molecules involved in regulation of immune response to enhance the potency of Her2/neu DNA vaccines. Some studies fused adjuvant gene to C-terminal domain of Her2/neu gene, while others fused the adjuvant gene N-terminally to Her2/neu gene, but no comparison on how direction of fusion could affect efficiency of DNA vaccine has ever been made. Based on previous reports demonstrating potent adjuvant activity of gp96 C-terminal domain, we chose it as adjuvant. The aim of this study was to investigate if direction of fusion could affect adjuvant activity of gp96 C-terminal domain or potency of Her2/neu DNA vaccination. To do so, we fused C-terminal domain of gp96 to downstream or C-terminal end of transmembrane and extracellular domain (TM+ECD) of rat Her2/neu and resultant immune response to DNA vaccination was evaluated. The results were compared with that of N-terminally fusion of gp96 C-terminal domain to TM+ECD of rat Her2/neu. Our results revealed that adjuvant activity of gp96 C-terminal domain is enhanced when fused N-terminally to TM+ECD of rat Her2/neu. It suggests that adjuvant activity of gp96 C-terminal domain towards Her2/neu is fusion direction-dependent.

Abstract: Many proteins have been isolated from eukaryotes as redox-sensitive proteins, but whether these proteins are present in prokaryotes is not clear. Redox-sensitive proteins contain disulfide bonds, and their enzymatic activity is modulated by redox in vivo. In the present study, we used thiol affinity purification and mass spectrometry to isolate and identify 19 disulfide-bond-containing proteins in Pseudomonas putida exposed to potential oxidative damages. Among these proteins, we found that a typical 2-Cys Prx-like protein (designated PpPrx) displays diversity in structure and apparent molecular weight (MW) and can act as both a peroxidase and a molecular chaperone. We also identified a regulatory factor involved in this structural and functional switching. Exposure of pseudomonads to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused the protein structures of PpPrx to convert from high MW complexes to low MW forms, triggering a chaperone-to-peroxidase functional switch. This structural switching was primarily guided by the thioredoxin system. Thus, the peroxidase efficiency of PpPrx is clearly associated with its ability to form distinct protein structures in response to stress.

Abstract: MicroRNA145 (miR145), a tumor suppressor miR, has been reported to inhibit growth of human cancer cells, to induce differentiation and to cause apoptosis, all conditions that result in growth arrest. In order to clarify the functional effects of miR145, we have investigated its expression in diverse conditions and different cell lines. Our results show that miR145 levels definitely increase in differentiating cells and also in growth-arrested cells, even in the absence of differentiation. Increased expression during differentiation sometimes occurs as a late event, suggesting that miR145 could be required either early or late during the differentiation process.

Abstract: Fluid shear stress regulates gene expression in osteoblasts, in part by activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. We examined whether this process was under the control of purinoceptor activation. MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts under static conditions expressed the NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα and exhibited cytosolic localization of NF-κB. Under fluid shear stress, IκBα levels decreased, and concomitant nuclear localization of NF-κB was observed. Cells exposed to fluid shear stress in ATP-depleted medium exhibited no significant reduction in IκBα, and NF-κB remained within the cytosol. Similar results were found using oxidized ATP or Brilliant Blue G, P2X7 receptor antagonists, indicating that the P2X7 receptor is responsible for fluid shear-stress-induced IκBα degradation and nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Pharmacologic blockage of the P2Y6 receptor also prevented shear-induced IκBα degradation. These phenomena involved neither ERK1/2 signaling nor autocrine activation by P2X7-generated lysophosphatidic acid. Our results suggest that fluid shear stress regulates NF-κB activity through the P2Y6 and P2X7 receptor.

Abstract: Matrin 3 is an integral component of nuclear matrix architecture that has been implicated in interacting with other nuclear proteins and thus modulating the activity of proximal promoters. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of this protein to proliferation of endothelial cells. To selectively modulate matrin 3 expression, we used siRNA oligonucleotides and transfection of cells with a pEGFP-N1-Mtr3. Our data indicate that downregulation of matrin 3 is responsible for reduced proliferation and leads to necrosis of endothelial cells. This conclusion is supported by observations that reducing matrin 3 expression results in (a) producing signs of necrosis detected by PI staining, LDH release, and scatter parameters in flow cytometry, (b) affecting cell cycle progression. It does not cause (c) membrane asymmetry of cells as indicated by lack of Annexin V binding as well as (d) activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of PARP. We conclude that matrin 3 plays a significant role in controlling cell growth and proliferation, probably via formation of complexes with nuclear proteins that modulate pro- and antiapoptotic signaling pathways. Thus, degradation of matrin 3 may be a switching event that induces a shift from apoptotic to necrotic death of cells.

Abstract: There are two critical stages in the retroviral reprogramming of somatic cells to produce human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. One is the production of high titer virus required to reprogram somatic cells; the other is identification of true hiPSC colonies from heterogeneous cell populations, and their isolation and expansion to generate a sustainable, pluripotent stem cell line. Here we describe simple, time-saving methods to address the current difficulties at these two critical junctures. First, we have developed a method to increase the number of infectious viral units 600-fold. Second, we have developed a TRA-1-81-based positive selection column method for isolating “true” hiPSCs from the heterogeneous cell populations, which overcomes the labor-intensive and highly subjective method of manual selection of hiPSC colonies. We have used these techniques to produce 8 hiPSC lines from human fibroblasts and we believe that they are of considerable utility to researchers in the hiPSC field.

Abstract: Summary
While subunit vaccines have shown partial efficacy in clinical trials, radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) remain the “gold standard” for sterilizing protection against Plasmodium infection in human vaccinees. The variability in immunogenicity and replication introduced by the extensive, random DNA damage necessary to generate RAS could be overcome by genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) designed via gene deletion to arrest at defined points during liver-stage development. Here, we demonstrate the principle that late liver stage-arresting GAP induce larger and broader CD8 T cell responses that provide superior protection in inbred and outbred mice compared to RAS or early-arresting GAP immunizations. Late liver stage-arresting GAP also engender high levels of cross-stage and cross-species protection and complete protection when administered by translationally relevant intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Collectively, our results underscore the potential utility of late liver stage-arresting GAP as broadly protective next-generation live-attenuated malaria vaccines and support their potential as a powerful model for identifying antigens to generate cross-stage protection.

Abstract: Interleukin-31 (IL-31) is a member of the four helical-bundle gp130/IL-6 cytokine family. Despite its implicated roles in inflammatory diseases, the biosynthetic processes of IL-31 have been poorly investigated. A detailed understanding of IL-31 biosynthesis and the nature of ligand–receptor interactions can provide insights into effective strategies for the design of therapeutic approaches. By using various heterologous protein expression systems, we demonstrated that murine IL-31 was secreted as inter-molecularly disulfide-bonded covalent aggregates. Covalently aggregated IL-31 appeared while trafficking in the secretory pathway, but was not actively retained in the ER. The aggregate formation was not caused by a dysfunctional ER quality control mechanism or an intrinsic limitation in protein folding capacity. Furthermore, secreted IL-31 aggregates were part of a large complex composed of various pleiotropic secretory factors and immune-stimulators. The extent and the heterogeneous nature of aggregates may imply that IL-31 was erroneously folded, but it was capable of signaling through cognate receptors. Mutagenesis revealed the promiscuity of all five cysteines in inter-molecular disulfide formation with components of the hetero-aggregates, but no cysteine was required for IL-31 secretion itself. Our present study not only illustrated various functions that cysteines perform during IL-31 biosynthesis and secretion, but also highlighted their potential roles in cytokine effector functions.

Abstract: We previously reported that IRF-9/STAT2 functional interaction could drive the expression of retinoic acid-induced gene G (RIG-G), independently of STAT1 and the classical JAK–STAT pathway, providing a novel alternative pathway for interferons (IFN) to mediate their multiple biological properties. In addition, we also found that IRF-1 could regulate RIG-G induction as well as the expression of IRF-9 and STAT2 in some cases. But the mechanisms by which IRF-1 exerted its action remained to be elucidated. Here, we showed that STAT1 could significantly enhance the effects of the IRF-9/STAT2 complex or IRF-1 on RIG-G induction through an activated JAK–STAT pathway, though it was not essential for RIG-G expression. In STAT1-deficient U3A cells, IRF-1 could induce RIG-G expression via the IFN-stimulated response elements in the RIG-G gene promoter, but it failed to upregulate IRF-9 and STAT2 unless the U3A cells were reconstituted by exogenous STAT1. In STAT1-expressing cells, IRF-1 indirectly activated RIG-G expression through an IRF-9/STAT2-dependent manner. Taken together, we concluded that the expression of RIG-G was independent on the classical JAK–STAT pathway, but could be greatly increased by it. This work will be of great benefit to us for a better understanding of the mechanisms on RIG-G gene expression regulation.

Abstract: Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins (LMs) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis. In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma. Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121, laminin-211, laminin-411/421, and laminin-511/521. Laminin-332 was not detected. In functional assays, laminin-111, laminin-332, and laminin-511, but not laminin-211 and laminin-411, strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors. Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active, and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMα5 also promoted cell migration. Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed α6β1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111, and both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511. In contrast, isolated LMα5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via αVβ3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides. Given the ubiquitous expression of α5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures, as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms, the α5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via α3β1 and other integrin receptors.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a crucial role in the protection of cells. In the present study, we have identified an hsp90-related gene (Djhsp90) encoding a cytosolic form of HSP90 that is primarily expressed in gastrodermis of the planarian Dugesia japonica. Djhsp90 becomes significantly induced after traumatic amputation or other stress stimuli, such as exposure to X-ray or ultraviolet radiations, heat shock, or prolonged starvation. When Djhsp90 is silenced by ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi), planarians dramatically decrease in size, becoming unable to eat, and die in a few weeks. Our results indicate that this gene plays an essential cytoprotective role in the gastrodermis of planarians and suggest that this chaperone can be involved in autophagic processes that are activated by this tissue.

Abstract: Dexamethasone has been shown to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration, which is required for preventing restenosis. However, the mechanism underlying effect of dexamethasone remains unknown. We have previously demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) can inhibit VSMC migration and proliferation. Here, we investigated the role of PGC-1α in dexamethasone-reduced VSMC migration and explored the possible mechanism. We first examined PGC-1α expression in cultured rat aortic VSMCs. The results revealed that incubation of VSMCs with dexamethasone could significantly elevate PGC-1α mRNA expression. In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) decreased PGC-1α expression while stimulating VSMC migration. Mechanistic study showed that suppression of PGC-1α by small interfering RNA strongly abrogated the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on VSMC migration, whereas overexpression of PGC-1α had the opposite effect. Furthermore, an analysis of MAPK signal pathways showed that dexamethasone inhibited ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in VSMCs. Overexpression of PGC-1α decreased both basal and PDGF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but it had no effect on ERK phosphorylation. Finally, inhibition of PPARγ activation by a PPARγ antagonist GW9662 abolished the suppressive effects of PGC-1α on p38 MAPK phosphorylation and VSMC migration. These effects of PGC-1α were enhanced by a PPARγ agonist troglitazone. Collectively, our data indicated for the first time that one of the anti-migrated mechanisms of dexamethasone is due to the induction of PGC-1α expression. PGC-1α suppresses PDGF-induced VSMC migration through PPARγ coactivation and, consequently, p38 MAPK inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Leishmania donovani causes human visceral leishmaniasis. The parasite infectious cycle comprises extracellular flagellated promastigotes that proliferate inside the insect vector, and intracellular nonmotile amastigotes that multiply within infected host cells. Using primary macrophages infected with virulent metacyclic promastigotes and high spatiotemporal resolution microscopy, we dissect the dynamics of the early infection process. We find that motile promastigotes enter macrophages in a polarized manner through their flagellar tip and are engulfed into host lysosomal compartments. Persistent intracellular flagellar activity leads to reorientation of the parasite flagellum toward the host cell periphery and results in oscillatory parasite movement. The latter is associated with local lysosomal exocytosis and host cell plasma membrane wounding. These findings implicate lysosome recruitment followed by lysosome exocytosis, consistent with parasite-driven host cell injury, as key cellular events in Leishmania host cell infection. This work highlights the role of promastigote polarity and motility during parasite entry.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal microbiota is important for induction of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is associated with complex shifts in microbiota composition, but it is unclear whether specific bacterial subsets induce IBD and, if so, whether their proportions in the microbiota are altered during disease. Here, we fulfilled Koch's postulates in host-genotype-specific fashion using a mouse model of IBD with human-relevant disease-susceptibility mutations. From screening experiments we isolated common commensal Bacteroides species, introduced them into antibiotic-pretreated mice, and quantitatively reisolated them in culture. The bacteria colonized IBD-susceptible and -nonsusceptible mice equivalently, but induced disease exclusively in susceptible animals. Conversely, commensal Enterobacteriaceae were >100-fold enriched during spontaneous disease, but an Enterobacteriaceae isolate failed to induce disease in antibiotic-pretreated mice despite robust colonization. We thus demonstrate that IBD-associated microbiota alterations do not necessarily reflect underlying disease etiology. These findings establish important experimental criteria and a conceptual framework for understanding microbial contributions to IBD.

Abstract: Embryonic germ cells (EGC) are cultured pluripotent cells derived from primordial germ cells (PGC). This study explored the possibility of establishing porcine EGC from domestic breeds and Yucatan mini pigs using embryos at Days 17–24 of gestation. In vitro culture of PGC from both pooled and individual embryos resulted in the successful derivation of putative EGC lines from Days 20 to 24 with high efficiency. RT-PCR showed that gene expression among all 31 obtained cell lines was very similar, and only minor changes were detected during in vitro passaging of the cells. Genome-wide RNA-Seq expression profiling showed no expression of the core pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, although most other pluripotency genes were expressed at levels comparable to those of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). Moreover, germ-specific genes such as BLIMP1 retained their expression. Functional annotation clustering of the gene expression pattern of the putative EGC suggests partial differentiation toward endo/mesodermal lineages. The putative EGC were able to form embryoid bodies in suspension culture and to differentiate into epithelial-like, mesenchymal-like, and neuronal-like cells. However, their injection into immunodeficient mice did not result in teratoma formation. Our results suggest that the PGC-derived cells described in this study are EGC-like, but seem to be multipotent rather than pluripotent cells. Nevertheless, the thorough characterization of these cells in this study, and especially the identification of various genes and pathways involved in pluripotency by RNA-Seq, will serve as a rich resource for further derivation of porcine EGC.

Abstract: The establishment of in vitro culture systems to expand stem cells and to elucidate the niche/stem cell interaction is among the most sought-after culture systems of our time. To further investigate niche/stem cell interactions, we evaluated in vitro cultures of isolated intact male germline–niche complexes (i.e., apical complexes), complexes with empty niche spaces, and completely empty niches (i.e., isolated apical cells) from the testes of Locusta migratoria and the interaction of these complexes with isolated germline stem cells, spermatogonia (of transit-amplifying stages), cyst progenitor cells, cyst progenitor cell-like cells, cyst cells, and follicle envelope cells. The structural characteristics of these cell types allow the identification of the different cell types in primary cultures, which we studied in detail by light and electron microscopy. In intact testes germline stem cells strongly adhere to their niche (the apical cell), but emigrate from their niche and form filopodia if the apical complex is put into culture with “standard media.” The lively movements of the long filopodia of isolated germline stem cells and spermatogonia may be indicative of their search for specific signals to home to their niche. All other incubated cell types (except for follicle envelope cells) expressed rhizopodia and lobopodia. Nevertheless isolated germline stem cells in culture do not migrate to empty niche spaces of nearby apical cells. This could indicate that apical cells lose their germline stem cell attracting ability in vitro, although apical cells devoid of germline stem cells either by emigration of germline stem cells or by mechanical removal of germline stem cells are capable of surviving in vitro up to 56days, forming many small lobopodia and performing amoeboid movements. We hypothesize that the breakdown of the apical complex in vitro with standard media interrupts the signaling between the germline stem cells and the niche (and conceivably the cyst progenitor cells) which directs the typical behavior of the male regenerative center. Previously we demonstrated the necessity of the apical cell for the survival of the germline stem cell. From these studies we are now able to culture viable isolated germline stem cells and all cells of its niche complex, although DNA synthesis stops after Day 1 in culture. This enables us to examine the effects of supplements to our standard medium on the interaction of the germline stem cell with its niche, the apical cell. The supplements we evaluated included conditioned medium, tissues, organs, and hemolymph of male locusts, insect hormones, mammalian growth factors, Ca2+ ion, and a Ca2+ ionophore. Although biological effects on the germline stem cell and apical cell could be detected with the additives, none of these supplements restored the in vivo behavior of the incubated cell types. We conclude that the strong adhesion between germline stem cells and apical cells in vivo is actively maintained by peripheral factors that reach the apical complex via hemolymph, since a hemolymph–testis barrier does not exist. The in vitro culture model introduced in this study provides a platform to scan for possible regulatory factors that play a key role in a feedback loop that keeps germline stem cell division and sperm disposal in equilibrium.

Abstract: A high concentration of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) stimulates myogenic progenitor cells to undergo heterotopic osteogenic differentiation. However, the physiological role of the Smad signaling pathway during terminal muscle differentiation has not been resolved. We report here that Smad1/5/8 was phosphorylated and activated in undifferentiated growing mouse myogenic progenitor Ric10 cells without exposure to any exogenous BMPs. The amount of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 was severely reduced during precocious myogenic differentiation under the high cell density culture condition even in growth medium supplemented with a high concentration of serum. Inhibition of the Smad signaling pathway by dorsomorphin, an inhibitor of Smad activation, or noggin, a specific antagonist of BMP, induced precocious terminal differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells in a cell density-dependent fashion even in growth medium. In addition, Smad1/5/8 was transiently activated in proliferating myogenic progenitor cells during muscle regeneration in rats. The present results indicate that the Smad signaling pathway is involved in a critical switch between growth and differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, precocious cell density-dependent myogenic differentiation suggests that a community effect triggers the terminal muscle differentiation of myogenic cells by quenching the Smad signaling.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Indeed, it has been estimated that 37,000 Americans will die from this disease in 2010. Late diagnosis, chemoresistance, and radioresistance of these tumors are major reasons for poor patient outcome, spurring the search for pancreatic cancer early diagnostic and therapeutic targets. ErbB4 (HER4) is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a family that also includes the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1), Neu/ErbB2/HER2, and ErbB3/HER3. These RTKs play central roles in many human malignancies by regulating cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, invasiveness, motility, and apoptosis. In this report we demonstrate that human pancreatic tumor cell lines exhibit minimal ErbB4 expression; in contrast, these cell lines exhibit varied and in some cases abundant expression and basal tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3. Expression of a constitutively-dimerized and -active ErbB4 mutant inhibits clonogenic proliferation of CaPan-1, HPAC, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1 pancreatic tumor cell lines. In contrast, expression of wild-type ErbB4 in pancreatic tumor cell lines potentiates stimulation of anchorage-independent colony formation by the ErbB4 ligand Neuregulin 1β. These results illustrate the multiple roles that ErbB4 may be playing in pancreatic tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

ATRA-induced HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell differentiation depends on the CD38 cytosolic tail needed for membrane localization, but CD38 enzymatic activity is unnecessary,

Abstract: Leukocyte antigen CD38 expression is an early marker of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) stimulated differentiation in the leukemic cell line HL-60. It promotes induced myeloid maturation when overexpressed, whereas knocking it down is inhibitory. It is a type II membrane protein with an extracellular C-terminal enzymatic domain with NADase/NADPase and ADPR cyclase activity and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail. Here we determined whether CD38 enzymatic activity or the cytoplasmic tail is required for ATRA-induced differentiation. Neither a specific CD38 ectoenzyme inhibitor nor a point mutation that cripples enzymatic activity (CD38 E226Q) diminishes ATRA-induced differentiation or G1/0 arrest. In contrast a cytosolic deletion mutation (CD38 Δ11–20) prevents membrane expression and inhibits differentiation and G1/0 arrest. These results may be consistent with disrupting the function of critical molecules necessary for membrane-expressed CD38 signal transduction. One candidate molecule is the Src family kinase Fgr, which failed to undergo ATRA-induced upregulation in CD38 Δ11–20 expressing cells. Another is Vav1, which also showed only basal expression after ATRA treatment in CD38 Δ11–20 expressing cells. Therefore, the ability of CD38 to propel ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation and G1/0 arrest is unimpaired by loss of its ectoenzyme activity. However a cytosolic tail deletion mutation disrupted membrane localization and inhibited differentiation. ATRA-induced differentiation thus does not require the CD38 ectoenzyme function, but is dependent on a membrane receptor function.

Abstract: The therapeutic potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has long been appreciated, and the recent FDA approval of hESC derivatives for cell-based therapy encourages the clinical application of hESCs. Here, using CHA3-hESCs with normal and abnormal karyotypes, we report the importance of maintaining normal chromosomes during in vitro culture and the differentiation of hESCs for minimization of posttransplantation complications. We found that undifferentiated CHA3-hESCs with trisomy chromosome 12 undergo abnormal cell division with multiple spindles in comparison to the bipolar cell division of the karyotypically normal CHA3-hESCs. Transplanted karyotypically abnormal CHA3-hESC derivatives formed a tumor-like tissue 6weeks after transplantation in two out of seven mice tested. Our results demonstrate that the preservation of normal chromosomes is indispensable for maintaining the true properties of hESCs in vitro and abolishing adverse effects posttransplantation. Thus, the development of optimized techniques for stabilizing the chromosome state during in vitro hESC culture is a prerequisite for the therapeutic application of hESCs.

Abstract: Endocytic trafficking plays an important role in signal transduction. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) have both been localized to endosomal structures and are dependent upon endocytosis for downstream function. While the dependence of MAPK signaling upon endosomes has been well characterized, the involvement of endosomes in regulating STAT3 signaling has not been defined. Consequently, this study evaluated the role of endosomes in the initiation, modulation, amplification and persistence of interleukin-6(IL-6)-induced STAT3 signal transduction and transcription, and utilized IL-6-induced MAPK signaling as a comparator. Using pharmacologic treatment and temperature control of endocytic trafficking, pulse-chase treatments and in vitro kinase assays, STAT3 was found to interact with endosomes in a markedly different fashion than MAPK. STAT3 was activated by direct interaction with internal structures upstream of the late endosome following IL-6 exposure and persistent STAT3 signaling depended upon recurrent activation from endocytic structures. Further, STAT3 subcellular localization was not dependent upon endocytic trafficking. Instead, STAT3 transiently interacted with endosomes and relocated to the nucleus by an endosome-independent mechanism. Finally, endocytic trafficking played a central role in regulating STAT3 serine 727 phosphorylation through crosstalk with the MAPK signaling system. Together, these data reveal endosomes as central to the genesis, course and outcome of STAT3 signal transduction and transcription.

Abstract: Stable expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 confers increased migratory behavior to the neuronal progenitor cell line ST14A, in response to neuregulin 1 (NRG1) stimulation. We used gene expression profiling analysis to identify transcriptional changes associated with higher migratory activity caused by the activation of a specific ErbB4 isoform, and found constitutive up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), a multimodular regulator of actin dynamics. We confirmed the increase of Eps8, both at the mRNA and at the protein level, in stable clones expressing two different ErbB4 isoforms, both characterized by high migratory activity. Using Transwell assays and experimental manipulation of Eps8 expression level, we demonstrated that Eps8 synergizes with ErbB4 to increase both basal and ligand induced cell migration, whereas siRNA mediated Eps8 silencing strongly impairs cell motility and NRG1 induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling. By transient knockdown of Eps8 through in vivo siRNA electroporation, followed by explant primary cultures, we demonstrated that Eps8 down-regulation affects migration of normal neuronal precursors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Eps8 is a key regulator of motility of neuronal progenitor cells expressing ErbB4, both in basal conditions and in response to external motogenic cues.

Abstract: Chromatin regulation is crucial for many biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. We have found that it is also important for neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) function and neurogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is specifically up-regulated in Mrg15 deficient NSCs. Knockdown of p21 expression by p21 shRNA results in restoration of cell proliferation. This indicates that p21 is directly involved in the growth defects observed in Mrg15 deficient NSCs. Activated p53 accumulates in Mrg15 deficient NSCs and this most likely accounts for the up-regulation of p21 expression in the cells. We observed decreased p53 and p21 levels and a concomitant increase in the percentage of BrdU positive cells in Mrg15 null cultures following expression of p53 shRNA. DNA damage foci, as indicated by immunostaining for γH2AX and 53BP1, are detectable in a sub-population of Mrg15 deficient NSC cultures under normal growing conditions and the majority of p21-positive cells are also positive for 53BP1 foci. Furthermore, Mrg15 deficient NSCs exhibit severe defects in DNA damage response following ionizing radiation. Our observations highlight the importance of chromatin regulation and DNA damage response in NSC function and maintenance.

Abstract: Improving cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells is mandatory to provide functional heart muscle cells for novel therapies. Here, we have investigated the enhancing effect of the small molecule SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, on cardiomyogenesis in hESC by monitoring the phosphorylation patterns of the major MAPK pathway components p38, JNK and ERK by western immunoblotting. A remarkable drop in phosphorylation levels of all three MAPK pathways was induced after overnight embryoid body (EB) formation. Upon further differentiation, phosphorylation dynamics in EBs were specifically altered by distinct inhibitor concentrations. At 5μM of SB203580, cardiomyogenesis was most efficient and associated with the expected p38 pathway inhibition. In parallel, JNK activation was observed suggesting a regulatory interlink between these pathways in hESC ultimately supporting cardiac differentiation. In contrast, moderately elevated SB203580 concentrations (15–30μM) resulted in complete disruption of cardiomyogenesis which was associated with prominent inhibition of ERK and further elevated JNK activity. We propose that a tightly-balanced pattern in MAPK phosphorylation is important for early mesoderm and subsequent cardiomyocyte formation. Our data provide novel insights into molecular consequences of small molecule supplementation in hESC differentiation, emphasizing the role of MAPK-signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Secondary bacterial infection is a common sequela to viral infection and is associated with increased lethality and morbidity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that the TLR3/MDA5 agonist poly I:C or viral infection dramatically augments signaling via the NLRs Nod1 and Nod2 and enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Enhanced Nod1 and Nod2 signaling by poly I:C required the TLR3/MDA5 adaptors TRIF and IPS-1 and was mediated by type I IFNs. Mechanistically, poly I:C or IFN-β induced the expression of Nod1, Nod2, and the Nod-signaling adaptor Rip2. Systemic administration of poly I:C or IFN-β or infection with murine norovirus-1 promoted inflammation and lethality in mice superinfected with E. coli, which was independent of bacterial burden but attenuated in the absence of Nod1/Nod2 or Rip2. Thus, crosstalk between type I IFNs and Nod1/Nod2 signaling promotes bacterial recognition, but induces harmful effects in the virally infected host.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrated that the molecules secreted from astrocytes play important roles in the cell fate determination of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the exact molecules involved and its possible mechanisms in the process remain largely unknown. In this study, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) obtained from astrocytes unstimulated or stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was prepared to treat NSCs. The results showed that both the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs treated with stimulated ACMs were significantly increased compared with those treated with unstimulated ACM. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibody neutralization of the ACMs decreased NSC proliferation and astrogliogenesis, while NSC neurogenesis was increased. In contrast, recombinant IL-6 cytokine increased NSC proliferation and astrogliogenesis, but decreased neurogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-stat3) protein as well as serial of basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors (bHLH) mRNA in NSCs exposed to stimulated ACMs significantly increased, respectively. The expression levels of p-stat3 protein and bHLH mRNA of NSCs were significantly altered after adding anti-IL-6 antibody or recombinant IL-6, respectively. The data suggest that IL-6 secreted from activated astrocytes participates in ACM-induced proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the phosphorylation of stat3 signals and the expression of bHLH transcription factors.

Abstract: Summary
Host nitric oxide (NO⋅) production is important for controlling intracellular bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. S. Typhmurium 14028s is prototrophic for all amino acids but cannot synthesize methionine (M) or lysine (K) during nitrosative stress. Here, we show that NO⋅-induced MK auxotrophy results from reduced succinyl-CoA availability as a consequence of NO⋅ targeting of lipoamide-dependent lipoamide dehydrogenase (LpdA) activity. LpdA is an essential component of the pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. Additional effects of NO⋅ on gene regulation prevent compensatory pathways of succinyl-CoA production. Microarray analysis indicates that over 50% of the transcriptional response of S. Typhimurium to nitrosative stress is attributable to LpdA inhibition. Bacterial methionine transport is essential for virulence in NO⋅-producing mice, demonstrating that NO⋅-induced MK auxotrophy occurs in vivo. These observations underscore the importance of metabolic targets for antimicrobial actions of NO⋅.

Abstract: Hyaluronan (HA) production has been functionally implicated in prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis. We previously used prostate tumor cells overexpressing the HA synthesizing enzyme HAS3 or the clinically relevant hyaluronidase Hyal1 to show that excess HA production suppresses tumor growth, while HA turnover accelerates spontaneous metastasis from the prostate. Here, we examined pathways responsible for effects of HAS3 and Hyal1 on tumor cell phenotype. Detailed characterization of cell cycle progression revealed that expression of Hyal1 accelerated cell cycle re-entry following synchronization, whereas HAS3 alone delayed entry. Hyal1 expressing cells exhibited a significant reduction in their ability to sustain ERK phosphorylation upon stimulation by growth factors, and in their expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. In contrast, HAS3 expressing cells showed prolonged ERK phosphorylation and increased expression of both p21 and p27, in asynchronous and synchronized cultures. Changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins were accompanied by HA-induced suppression of N-cadherin, while E-cadherin expression and β-catenin expression and distribution remained unchanged. Our results are consistent with a model in which excess HA synthesis suppresses cell proliferation by promoting homotypic E-cadherin mediated cell–cell adhesion, consequently signaling to elevate cell cycle inhibitor expression and suppress G1- to S-phase transition.

Abstract: Oxidative stress in photodynamic therapy (PDT)-treated tumor cells is known to instigate a strong upregulation of the expression of heat shock proteins. However, the treatment of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells with Photofrin™ PDT resulted in the upregulation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) gene not only in these cells but also in co-incubated untreated Hepa 1-6 cells. To investigate whether this phenomenon extends in vivo, LLC tumors growing in C57BL/6 mice were treated with Photofrin™ PDT. The tumors and the livers from the mice were collected at 4, 8, or 24 h after therapy for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of Hsp70 gene expression. Increased Hsp70 gene expression was detected in both the tumor and liver tissues and was most pronounced at 4 h after PDT. This effect was inhibited by treatment of host mice with glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone. Hsp70 protein levels in the livers of mice bearing PDT-treated tumors gradually decreased after therapy while serum levels increased at 4 h after therapy and then continually decreased. The exposure of in vitro PDT-treated LLC cells to Hsp70 and subsequent flow cytometry analysis revealed binding of this protein to cells that was dependent on PDT dose and more pronounced with dying than viable cells. Thus, following the induction of tumor injury by PDT, Hsp70 can be produced in the liver and spleen as acute phase reactant and released into circulation, from where it can be rapidly sequestered to damaged tumor tissue to facilitate the disposal of dying cells.

Abstract: Mutations in the PKHD1 gene result in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) in humans. To determine the molecular mechanism of the cystogenesis in ARPKD, we recently generated a mouse model for ARPKD that carries a targeted mutation in the mouse orthologue of human PKHD1. The homozygous mutant mice display hepatorenal cysts whose phenotypes are similar to those of human ARPKD patients. By littermates of this mouse, we developed two immortalized renal collecting duct cell lines with Pkhd1 and two without. Under nonpermissive culture conditions, the Pkhd1−/− renal cells displayed aberrant cell–cell contacts and tubulomorphogenesis. The Pkhd1−/− cells also showed significantly reduced cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis. To validate this finding in vivo, we examined proliferation and apoptosis in the kidneys of Pkhd1−/− mice and their wildtype littermates. Using proliferation (PCNA and Histone-3) and apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase-3) markers, similar results were obtained in the Pkhd1−/− kidney tissues as in the cells. To identify the molecular basis of these findings, we analyzed the effect of Pkhd1 loss on multiple putative signaling regulators. We demonstrated that the loss of Pkhd1 disrupts multiple major phosphorylations of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and these disruptions either inhibit the Ras/C-Raf pathways to suppress MEK/ERK activity and ultimately reduce cell proliferation, or suppress PDK1/AKT to upregulate Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 and promote apoptosis. Our findings indicate that apoptosis may be a major player in the cyst formation in ARPKD, which may lead to new therapeutic strategies for human ARPKD.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) belongs to the large family of KLF transcription factors, which comprises at least 17 members. Within this family, KLF7 is unique since its expression is strictly restricted within the nervous system during development. We have previously shown that KLF7 is required for neuronal morphogenesis and axon guidance in selected regions of the nervous system, including hippocampus, olfactory bulbs and cortex, as well as in neuronal cell cultures. In the present work, we have furthered our analysis of the role of KLF7 in central nervous system development. By gene expression analysis during brain embryogenesis, we found significant alterations in dopaminergic neurons in Klf7 null mice. In particular, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (Dat) transcripts are strongly decreased in the olfactory bulbs and ventral midbrain at birth, compared to wild-type littermates. Interestingly, Klf7-mutant mice show a dramatic reduction of TH-positive neurons in the olfactory bulbs, but no change in GABAergic or midbrain dopaminergic neurons. These observations raise the possibility that a lack of a KLF family member affects dopaminergic neuron development.

Abstract: Maintaining stable differentiated somatic cell function in culture is essential to a range of biological endeavors. However, current technologies, employing, for example, primary hepatic cell culture (essential to the development of a bio-artificial liver and improved drug and toxicology testing), are limited by supply, expense, and functional instability even on biological cell culture substrata. As such, novel biologically active substrates manufacturable to GMP standards have the potential to improve cell culture-based assay applications. Currently hepatic endoderm (HE) generated from pluripotent stem cells is a genotypically diverse, cheap, and stable source of “hepatocytes”; however, HE routine applications are limited due to phenotypic instability in culture. Therefore a manufacturable subcellular matrix capable of supporting long-term differentiated cell function would represent a step forward in developing scalable and phenotypically stable hESC-derived hepatocytes. Adopting an unbiased approach we screened polymer microarrays and identified a polyurethane matrix which promoted HE viability, hepatocellular gene expression, drug-inducible metabolism, and function. Moreover, the polyurethane supported, when coated on a clinically approved bio-artificial liver matrix, long-term hepatocyte function and growth. In conclusion, our data suggest that an unbiased screening approach can identify cell culture substrate(s) that enhance the phenotypic stability of primary and stem cell-derived cell resources.

Abstract: Molecular chaperones are central to cellular protein homeostasis. In mammals, protein misfolding diseases and aging cause inflammation and progressive tissue loss, in correlation with the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and the defective expression of chaperone genes. Bacteria and non-diseased, non-aged eukaryotic cells effectively respond to heat shock by inducing the accumulation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), many of which molecular chaperones involved in protein homeostasis, in reducing stress damages and promoting cellular recovery and thermotolerance. We performed a meta-analysis of published microarray data and compared expression profiles of HSP genes from mammalian and plant cells in response to heat or isothermal treatments with drugs. The differences and overlaps between HSP and chaperone genes were analyzed, and expression patterns were clustered and organized in a network. HSPs and chaperones only partly overlapped. Heat-shock induced a subset of chaperones primarily targeted to the cytoplasm and organelles but not to the endoplasmic reticulum, which organized into a network with a central core of Hsp90s, Hsp70s, and sHSPs. Heat was best mimicked by isothermal treatments with Hsp90 inhibitors, whereas less toxic drugs, some of which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, weakly expressed different subsets of Hsp chaperones. This type of analysis may uncover new HSP-inducing drugs to improve protein homeostasis in misfolding and aging diseases.

Abstract: Assays to quantify myocardial renewal rely on the accurate identification of cardiomyocyte nuclei. We previously 14C birth dated human cardiomyocytes based on the nuclear localization of cTroponins T and I. A recent report by Kajstura et al. suggested that cTroponin I is only localized to the nucleus in a senescent subpopulation of cardiomyocytes, implying that 14C birth dating of cTroponin T and I positive cell populations underestimates cardiomyocyte renewal in humans. We show here that the isolation of cell nuclei from the heart by flow cytometry with antibodies against cardiac Troponins T and I, as well as pericentriolar material 1 (PCM-1), allows for isolation of close to all cardiomyocyte nuclei, based on ploidy and marker expression. We also present a reassessment of cardiomyocyte ploidy, which has important implications for the analysis of cell turnover, and iododeoxyuridine (IdU) incorporation data. These data provide the foundation for reliable analysis of cardiomyocyte turnover in humans.

Abstract: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is pivotal in tumor metastasis. Our previous work reported an EMT model based on primary prostate epithelial cells (EP156T) which gave rise to cells with mesenchymal phenotype (EPT1) without malignant transformation. To promote prostate cell transformation, cells were maintained in saturation density cultures to select for cells overriding quiescence. Foci formed repeatedly following around 8 weeks in confluent EPT1 monolayers. Only later passage EPT1, but not EP156T cells of any passage, could form foci. Cells isolated from the foci were named EPT2 and formed robust colonies in soft agar, a malignant feature present neither in EP156T nor in EPT1 cells. EPT2 cells showed additional malignant traits in vitro, including higher ability to proliferate following confluence, higher resistance to apoptosis and lower dependence on exogenous growth factors than EP156T and EPT1 cells. Microarray profiling identified gene sets, many of which belong to cell junction modules, that changed expression from EP156T to EPT1 cells and continued to change from EPT1 to EPT2 cells. Our findings provide a novel stepwise cell culture model in which EMT emerges independently of transformation and is associated with subsequent accumulation of malignant features in prostate cells. Reprogramming of cell junction modules is involved in both steps.

Abstract: Arp2/3 complex is an actin polymerization nucleator and localized in the leading protrusions of migrating cells. It has been unclear how this complex is targeted to the protrusions and whether its localization is functionally important. We previously demonstrated that mRNAs encoding for the subunits of the complex were localized in the protrusions of fibroblasts, suggesting a mechanism to target the complex to the protrusions. We here present data demonstrating the importance of Arp2/3 complex mRNA localization in directional cell migration. Using a novel mechanism by which Dia1 mRNA is targeted to the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, we redirected the mRNA encoding Arp2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, to the perinuclear region in fibroblasts. Knockdown of Arp2 alone caused dramatic reduction of the complex and resulted in narrow protrusions, increased random cell migration speed and loss of directionality. Rescue with a protrusion-localizing Arp2 mRNA restored normal cell migration behavior, whereas rescue with a mis-localizing Arp2 mRNA failed to restore speed and directionality. These results demonstrate that localization of Arp2/3 complex mRNAs in the leading protrusions is functionally important for directional cell migration.

Abstract: A variety of microcarriers may be used for the expansion of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for cell therapy applications. This study investigated the effects of 10 types of microcarriers on hESC attachment efficiency, growth and pluripotency. High attachment efficiency was observed on uncoated microcarriers, however poor cell growth and/or gradual loss of pluripotency occurred during continuous passaging. Coating of the microcarriers with Matrigel resulted in higher cell yields and stable pluripotent states for at least three passages. Positively charged cylindrical cellulose microcarriers (DE52, DE53 and QA52) and large (190μm) positively charged spherical microcarriers (Cytodex 1) exhibited high cell expansion potential and levels of pluripotency. Lower cell yields were obtained using smaller diameter spherical (65μm and 10μm) or macroporous beads. Instead of Matrigel, laminin coated microcarriers (DE53 and Cytodex 1) are capable of supporting the long term propagation and pluripotency of HES-2 and HES-3 cell lines. HES-2 cell line which was shown earlier to be shear resistant achieved similar cell growth and expression of pluripotent markers when cultured on both Matrigel (84% Tra-1-60, 1.43×106cells/ml) and laminin (74% Tra-1-60, 1.37×106cells/ml) coated microcarriers in spinner flasks. In contrast, HES-3 exhibited a decrease in cell yield, viability and pluripotent markers on laminin as compared with Matrigel coated microcarriers possibly due to shear sensitivity. Conventional microcarriers intended for propagation of mammalian cells are not suitable for long term propagation of hESC. Matrigel or laminin coating is essential for stable long term propagation of hESC on a variety of microcarriers.

Abstract: Angiopoietins 1 and 2, ligands for the receptor kinase Tie-2, have been proposed to play critical but opposing roles in vascular development. Since signaling by Tie-2 is likely affected by other endothelial cell receptors such as Flk-1, the receptor for VEGF, and cell–cell adhesion receptors PECAM1 and VE-cad, we explored their interactions in a 3D model of vasculogenesis. When murine embryoid bodies (EBs) were treated with VEGF in Matrigel in the presence or absence of Ang-1 or Ang-2 for eight days, Ang-1 abrogated vascular sprouting for treatments started at days 0 or 3. In contrast, Ang-2 greatly accelerated vascular sprouting compared to untreated EBs. These results were confirmed in a second model system where VEGF treated HUVECs were grown in Matrigel in the presence or absence of Ang-1 or Ang-2. Since vascular sprouting must be precisely controlled in the developing embryo, it is likely that cell–cell adhesion molecules play a role in sensing the density of vascular sprouts. In this respect, we have shown that PECAM1 and CEACAM1 play essential roles in vascular sprouting. We now show that PECAM1 is associated with Tie-2, becomes phosphorylated on its ITIMs, and recruits the inhibitory phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. In addition, PECAM1 is associated with VE-cad and may similarly regulate its signaling via recruitment of SHP-1/2.

Abstract: Importin-α1 belongs to a receptor family that recognizes classical nuclear localization signals. Encoded by Kpna2, this receptor subtype is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In this study, we identified a critical promoter region in Kpna2 and showed that the expression of this gene is differentially regulated in ES cells and NIH3T3 cells. Conserved CCAAT boxes are required for Kpna2 promoter activity in both ES and NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, deletion of the region from nucleotide position −251 to −179bp resulted in a drastic reduction in Kpna2 transcriptional activity only in ES cells. This region contains Krüppel-like factor (Klf) binding sequences and is responsible for transactivation of the gene by Klf2 and Klf4. Accordingly, endogenous Kpna2 mRNA levels decreased in response to depletion of Klf2 and Klf4 in ES cells. Our results suggest that Klf2 and Klf4 function redundantly to drive high level of Kpna2 expression in ES cells.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to complete their life cycles. Picornaviruses use an internal ribosome entry site to initiate cap-independent protein translation and in parallel host cap-dependent translation is shut off. This process is thought to occur primarily via cleavage of host translation initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII by viral proteases. Here we describe another mechanism whereby miR-141 induced upon enterovirus infection targets the cap-dependent translation initiation factor, eIF4E, for shutoff of host protein synthesis. Knockdown of miR-141 reduces viral propagation, and silencing of eIF4E can completely reverse the inhibitory effect of the miR-141 antagomiR on viral propagation. Ectopic expression of miR-141 promotes the switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, EGR1, which is partly responsible for miR-141 induction in response to enterovirus infection. Our results suggest that upregulation of miR-141 upon enterovirus infection can facilitate viral propagation by expediting the translational switch.

Abstract: Summary
Plants have evolved sophisticated surveillance systems to recognize pathogen effectors delivered into host cells. RPM1 is an NB-LRR immune receptor that recognizes the Pseudomonas syringae effectors AvrB and AvrRpm1. Both effectors associate with and affect the phosphorylation of RIN4, an immune regulator. Although the kinase and the specific mechanisms involved are unclear, it has been hypothesized that RPM1 recognizes phosphorylated RIN4. Here, we identify RIPK as a RIN4-interacting receptor-like protein kinase that phosphorylates RIN4. In response to bacterial effectors, RIPK phosphorylates RIN4 at amino acid residues T21, S160, and T166. RIN4 phosphomimetic mutants display constitutive activation of RPM1-mediated defense responses and RIN4 phosphorylation is induced by AvrB and AvrRpm1 during P. syringae infection. RIPK knockout lines exhibit reduced RIN4 phosphorylation and blunted RPM1-mediated defense responses. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the RIPK kinase associates with and modifies an effector-targeted protein complex to initiate host immunity.

Abstract: Cell surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) is determined by the relative rates of its internalization and recycling. Changes in the cellular labile iron pool (LIP) affect many cellular mechanisms including those that regulate DAT trafficking. In this study, we analyzed DAT expression and posttranslational modifications in response to changes in cellular iron in transfected neuroblastoma cells (N2a). Iron chelation by desferrioxamine (DFO) altered DAT protein levels by decreasing the stability of DAT mRNA. Increased phosphorylation and ubiquitination of this transporter protein following DFO treatment were also observed. Cellular iron depletion elevated protein levels of the early endosomal marker Rab5. Moreover, confocal microscopy studies showed increased localization of DAT into the endosomal compartment in DFO-treated cells compared to control. Together, these findings suggest that cellular iron depletion regulates DAT expression through reducing mRNA stability as well as an increasing in endocytosis.

Abstract: In order to survive in extreme environments, organisms need to develop special adaptations both on physiological and molecular levels. The sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki, inhabiting temporary water pools in semi-arid regions of Africa, is the only insect to have evolutionarily acquired the ability to withstand prolonged complete desiccation at larval stage, entering a state called anhydrobiosis. Even after years in a dry state, larvae are able to revive within a short period of time, completely restoring metabolism. Because of the possible involvement of stress proteins in the preservation of biomolecules during the anhydrobiosis of the sleeping chironomid, we have analyzed the expression of genes encoding six heat shock proteins (Pv-hsp90, Pv-hsp70, Pv-hsc70, Pv-hsp60, Pv-hsp20, and Pv-p23) and one heat shock factor (Pv-hsf1) in dehydrating, rehydrating, and heat-shocked larvae. All examined genes were significantly up-regulated in the larvae upon dehydration and several patterns of expression were detected. Gene transcript of Pv-hsf1 was up-regulated within 8 h of desiccation, followed by large shock proteins expression reaching peak at 24–48 h of desiccation. Heat-shock-responsive Pv-hsp70 and Pv-hsp60 showed a two-peak expression: in dehydrating and rehydrating larvae. Both small alpha-crystallin heat shock proteins (sHSP) transcripts were accumulated in the desiccated larvae, but showed different expression profiles. Both sHSP-coding genes were found to be heat-inducible, and Pv-hsp20 was up-regulated in the larvae at the early stage of desiccation. In contrast, expression of the second transcript, corresponding to Pv-p23, was limited to the late stages of desiccation, suggesting possible involvement of this protein in the glass-state formation in anhydrobiotic larvae. We discuss possible roles of proteins encoded by these stress genes during the different stages of anhydrobiosis in P. vanderplanki.

Abstract: Cyclophilins are conserved cis–trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that are implicated in protein folding and function as molecular chaperones. The accumulation of Cpr1 protein to menadione in Saccharomyces cerevisiae KNU5377Y suggests a possibility that this protein may participate in the mechanism of stress tolerance. Stress response of S. cerevisiae KNU5377Y cpr1Δ mutant strain was investigated in the presence of menadione (MD). The growth ability of the strain was confirmed in an oxidant-supplemented medium, and a relationship was established between diminishing levels of cell rescue enzymes and MD sensitivity. The results demonstrate the significant effect of CPR1 disruption in the cellular growth rate, cell viability and morphology, and redox state in the presence of MD and suggest the possible role of Cpr1p in acquiring sensitivity to MD and its physiological role in cellular stress tolerance. The in vivo importance of Cpr1p for antioxidant-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) neutralization and chaperone-mediated protein folding was confirmed by analyzing the expression changes of a variety of cell rescue proteins in a CPR1-disrupted strain. The cpr1Δ to the exogenous MD showed reduced expression level of antioxidant enzymes, molecular chaperones, and metabolic enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)- or adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-generating systems. More importantly, it was shown that cpr1Δ mutant caused imbalance in the cellular redox homeostasis and increased ROS levels in the cytosol as well as mitochondria and elevated iron concentrations. As a result of excess ROS production, the cpr1Δ mutant provoked an increase in oxidative damage and a reduction in antioxidant activity and free radical scavenger ability. However, there was no difference in the stress responses between the wild-type and the cpr1Δ mutant strains derived from S. cerevisiae BY4741 as a control strain under the same stress. Unlike BY4741, KNU5377Y Cpr1 protein was decarbonylated during MD stress. Decarbonylation of Cpr1 protein in KNU5377Y strain seems to be caused by a rapid and efficient gene expression program via stress response factors Hsf1, Yap1, and Msn2. Hence, the decarbonylated Cpr1 protein may be critical in cellular redox homeostasis and may be a potential chaperone to menadione.

Abstract: The insulin-like growth factors 2 (IGF2) is a peptide hormone that binds to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and is abundantly stored in bone. IGF1R is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers that growth within bone and is also involved in osteoclast biology. Among different cell lines representative of osteolytic tumors, we found a very high expression of IGF2 in SH-SY5Y cells derived from neuroblastoma (NB). We previously showed that NB cells induce an osteolytic process through the Osteoprotegerin/RANKL/RANK and the canonical Wnt pathway system. Here, we hypothesized that NB promotes osteoclastogenesis also via IGF2. First, we demonstrated the presence of IGF1R on the osteoclast basolateral membrane, and we observed a cyclic IGF1R activation along with the differentiation process, also when induced by SH-SY5Y. Moreover, we found that IGF2 mRNA expression in SH-SY5Y cells was further increased when co-cultured with mesenchymal stromal cells, suggesting that IGF2 is important for NB interaction with the bone microenvironment. Finally, the treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with an anti-IGF2 siRNA or the addition of anti-IGF1R molecules impaired NB-induced osteoclastogenesis, even though the chemoattraction of monocytes by NB cells was unaffected.

Abstract: With the goal of obtaining clinically safe human adipose-derived stroma/stem cells (ASC) and eliminating the use of serum, we have developed a new culture system that allows the expansion of ASC as spheres in a defined medium. These spheres can be passaged several times. They are not only aggregated cells but rather originate from single cells as clonal spheres can be obtained after seeding at very low density and reform clonal spheres after dissociation. These spheres can also revert to monolayer growth when plated in medium containing human plasma and even generate fibroblast-like colonies (CFU-f). Under several differentiation-specific media, spheres-derived ASC maintain their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts, endothelial cells and adipocytes. These results indicate that human ASC can be maintained in a serum-free 3D culture system, which is of great interest for the expansion in bioreactors of autologous ASC and their use in clinical trials.

Abstract: The nuclear zinc finger protein ZFPIP/Zfp462 is an important factor involved in cell division during the early embryonic development of vertebrates. In pluripotent P19 cells, ZFPIP/Zfp462 takes part in cell proliferation, likely via its role in maintaining chromatin structure. To further define the function of ZFPIP/Zfp462 in the mechanisms of pluripotency and cell differentiation, we constructed a stable P19 cell line in which ZFPIP/Zfp462 knockdown is inducible. We report that ZFPIP/Zfp462 was vital for mitosis and self-renewal in pluripotent P19 cells. Its depletion induced substantial decreases in the expression of the pluripotency genes Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 and was associated with the transient expression of specific neuronal differentiation markers. We also demonstrated that ZFPIP/Zfp462 expression appears to be unnecessary after neuronal differentiation is induced in P19 cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that ZFPIP/Zfp462 is a key chromatin factor involved in maintaining P19 pluripotency and in the early mechanisms of neural differentiation but that it is dispensable in differentiated P19 cells.

Abstract: The clinical phenotype of cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency is dictated by the essential role of this vitamin in two key enzymatic reactions. Multiple proteins and receptors participate in the absorption, transport and delivery of this vitamin to tissue cells. Cellular uptake of Cbl is mediated by transcobalamin (TC), a plasma protein and a transmembrane receptor (TCblR) with high affinity for TC saturated with Cbl. Knockdown of TCblR with siRNA results in decreased TC–Cbl uptake. The ensuing Cbl deficiency leads to an increase in doubling time and decreased proliferation of these cells. The study confirms the seminal role of this receptor in the cellular uptake of Cbl and its down-regulation as a potential strategy to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells.

Abstract: Exosomes represent an important intercellular communication vehicle, mediating events essential for the decidual microenvironment. While we have demonstrated exosome induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to date, no extensive characterization of trophoblast-derived exosomes has been provided. Our objective was to provide a morphologic and proteomic characterization of these exosomes. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media of Swan71 human trophoblast cells by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation. These were analyzed for density (sucrose density gradient centrifugation), morphology (electron microscopy), size (dynamic light scattering) and protein composition (Ion Trap mass spectrometry and western immunoblotting). Based on density gradient centrifugation, microvesicles from Sw71 cells exhibit a density between 1.134 and 1.173g/ml. Electron microscopy demonstrated that microvesicles from Sw71 cells exhibit the characteristic cup-shaped morphology of exosomes. Dynamic light scattering showed a bell-shaped curve, indicating a homogeneous population with a mean size of 165nm±0.5nm. Ion Trap mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of exosome marker proteins (including CD81, Alix, cytoskeleton related proteins, and Rab family). The MS results were confirmed by western immunoblotting. Based on morphology, density, size and protein composition, we defined the release of exosomes from extravillous trophoblast cells and provide their first extensive characterization. This characterization is essential in furthering our understanding of “normal” early pregnancy.

Abstract: Many malignant tissues, including human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated cancers, express SerpinB2, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2). Whether SerpinB2 is expressed by the HPV-transformed cancer cells, and if so, whether SerpinB2 is mutated or behaves aberrantly remains unclear. Here we show that HPV-transformed CaSki cells express high levels of constitutive wild-type SerpinB2, with cellular distribution, glycosylation, secretion, cleavage, induction and urokinase binding similar to that reported for primary cells. Neutralization of secreted SerpinB2 failed to affect CaSki cell migration or growth. Lentivirus-based over-expression of SerpinB2 also had no effect on growth, and we were unable to confirm a role for SerpinB2 in binding or regulating expression of the retinoblastoma protein. CaSki cells thus emerge as a useful tool for studying SerpinB2, with the physiological function of SerpinB2 expression by tumor cells remaining controversial. Using CaSki cells as a source of endogenous SerpinB2, we confirmed that SerpinB2 efficiently binds the proteasomal subunit member β1.

Abstract: Summary
The protozoan parasite Leishmania alters the activity of its host cell, the macrophage. However, little is known about the effect of Leishmania infection on host protein synthesis. Here, we show that the Leishmania protease GP63 cleaves the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the translational repressor 4E-BP1. mTOR cleavage results in the inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and concomitant activation of 4E-BP1 to promote Leishmania proliferation. Consistent with these results, pharmacological activation of 4E-BPs with rapamycin, results in a dramatic increase in parasite replication. In contrast, genetic deletion of 4E-BP1/2 reduces parasite load in macrophages ex vivo and decreases susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis in vivo. The parasite resistant phenotype of 4E-BP1/2 double-knockout mice involves an enhanced type I IFN response. This study demonstrates that Leishmania evolved a survival mechanism by activating 4E-BPs, which serve as major targets for host translational control.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as important players, regulating the balance between protective immunity and immunopathology at mucosal surfaces. However, mechanisms that regulate ILCs' effector functions during mucosal pathogenic challenge are poorly defined. Using mice infected with the natural mouse enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, we demonstrate that lymphotoxin (LT) is essential for IL-22 production by intestinal ILCs. Blocking of LTβR signaling dramatically reduced intestinal IL-22 production after C. rodentium infection. Conversely, stimulating LTβR signaling induced an IL-22 protection pathway in LT-deficient mice. Furthermore, exogenous IL-22 expression rescued LTβR-deficient mice. IL-22-producing ILCs were predominantly located in lymphoid follicles in the colon and interacted closely with dendritic cells (DCs). We find that an LT-driven positive feedback loop controls IL-22 production by RORγt+ ILCs via LTβR signaling in DCs. Taken together, our data show that LTβR signaling in gut lymphoid follicles regulates IL-22 production by ILCs in response to mucosal pathogen challenge.

Abstract: The extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates diverse cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1) binds each of the three ERK cascade components to facilitate pathway activation. Even though KSR1 contains a C-terminal kinase domain, evidence supporting the catalytic function of KSR1 remains controversial. In this study, we produced recombinant wild-type or kinase-inactive (D683A/D700A) KSR1 proteins in Escherichia coli to test the hypothesis that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase. Recombinant wild-type KSR1, but not recombinant kinase-inactive KSR1, underwent autophosphorylation on serine residue(s), phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) as a generic substrate, and phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive MAPK/ERK kinase-1 (MEK1). Furthermore, FLAG immunoprecipitates from KSR1−/− colon epithelial cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type KSR1 (+KSR1), but not vector (+vector) or FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive KSR1 (+D683A/D700A), were able to phosphorylate kinase-inactive MEK1. Since TNF activates the ERK pathway in colon epithelial cells, we tested the biological effects of KSR1 in the survival response downstream of TNF. We found that +vector and +D683A/D700A cells underwent apoptosis when treated with TNF, whereas +KSR1 cells were resistant. However, +KSR1 cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell loss in the absence of MEK kinase activity. These data provide clear evidence that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase, MEK1 is an in vitro substrate of KSR1, and the catalytic activities of both proteins are required for eliciting cell survival responses downstream of TNF.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with the β-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is lifelong, causing limited disease in healthy adults, but life threatening in immunocompromised individuals. The viral kinase pUL97, a functional ortholog of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), is critical for HCMV replication and a target for antiviral drug development. Upon kinase inhibition, drug-resistant strains emerge with mutations in UL27, an HCMV gene of unknown function. Using a proteomics approach, we discovered that pUL27 is necessary and sufficient to degrade Tip60, a host acetyltransferase and interacting partner of HIV Tat. Consistent with this, the expression of Tat restored antiviral inhibition of an otherwise resistant HCMV strain. The functional consequence of Tip60 degradation was the induction of the CDK inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 and cell-cycle arrest, representing changes necessary for the antiviral effects of pUL97 inhibition. Consequently, either increasing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression or decreasing Tip60 levels improved the antiviral activity of the HCMV kinase inhibitor maribavir.

Abstract: HGF signaling induces epithelial cells to disassemble cadherin-based adhesion and increase cell motility and invasion, a process termed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT plays a major role in cancer metastasis, allowing individual cells to detach from the primary tumor, invade local tissue, and colonize distant tissues with new tumors. While invasion of vascular and lymphatic networks is the predominant route of metastasis, nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed perineual invasion (PNI). Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly understood, as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of invasion. Here we examine how HGF signaling contributes to PNI using reductionist culture model systems. We find that TGFβ, produced by PC12 cells, enhances scattering in response to HGF stimulation, increasing both cell–cell junction disassembly and cell migration. Further, gradients of TGFβ induce migratory mesenchymal cells to undergo chemotaxis towards the source of TGFβ. Interestingly, VEGF suppresses TGFβ-induced enhancement of scattering. These results have broad implications for how combinatorial growth factor signaling contributes to cancer metastasis, suggesting that VEGF and TGFβ might modulate HGF signaling to influence route selection during cancer progression.

Abstract: How the co-ordinated events of gene activation and silencing during cellular differentiation are influenced by spatial organization of the cell nucleus is still poorly understood. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling subnuclear distribution of transcription factors, and their interplay with nuclear proteins that shape chromatin structure. Here we show that C/EBPβ not only associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin but also interacts with the nucleoskeleton upon induction of adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Different C/EBPβ dimers localize in different nuclear domains. Using BiFC in living cells, we show that LAP (Liver Activating Protein) homodimers localize in euchromatin and heterochromatin. In contrast, LIP (Liver Inhibitory Protein) homodimers localize exclusively in heterochromatin. Importantly, their differential subnuclear distribution mirrors the site for interaction with HP1α. HP1α inhibits LAP transcriptional capacity and occupies the promoter of the C/EBPβ-dependent gene c/ebpα in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When adipogenesis is induced, HP1α binding decreases from c/ebpα promoter, allowing transcription. Thus, the equilibrium among different pools of C/EBPβ associated with chromatin or nucleoskeleton, and dynamic changes in their interaction with HP1α, play key roles in the regulation of C/EBP target genes during adipogenesis.

Abstract: Unicellular photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium are the most common endosymbionts of reef-building scleractinian corals, living in a symbiotic partnership known to be highly susceptible to environmental changes such as hyperthermic stress. In this study, we identified members of two major heat shock proteins (HSPs) families, Hsp70 and Hsp90, in Symbiodinium sp. (clade C) with full-length sequences that showed the highest similarity and evolutionary relationship with other known HSPs from dinoflagellate protists. Regulation of HSPs gene expression was examined in samples of the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora subjected to elevated temperatures progressively over 18 h (fast) and 120 h (gradual thermal stress). Moderate to severe heat stress at 26°C and 29°C (+3°C and +6°C above average sea temperature) resulted in an increase in algal Hsp70 gene expression from 39% to 57%, while extreme heat stress (+9°C) reduced Hsp70 transcript abundance by 60% (after 18 h) and 70% (after 120 h). Elevated temperatures decreased an Hsp90 expression under both rapid and gradual heat stress scenarios. Comparable Hsp70 and Hsp90 gene expression patterns were observed in Symbiodinium cultures and in hospite, indicating their independent regulation from the host. Differential gene expression profiles observed for Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggests diverse roles of these molecular chaperones during heat stress response. Reduced expression of the Hsp90 gene under heat stress can indicate a reduced role in inhibiting the heat shock transcription factor which may lead to activation of heat-inducible genes and heat acclimation.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastatic progression in various types of cancer cells, but the role and cellular mechanism in the invasive phenotype of gastric cancer cells is not known. Herein, we determined the roles of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in BMP-2-mediated metastatic function in gastric cancer. We found that stimulation of BMP-2 in gastric cancer cells enhanced the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK. Accompanying activation of AKT and ERK kinase, BMP-2 also enhanced phosphorylation/degradation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation/activation of NF-κB. Interestingly, blockade of PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling using LY294002 and PD98059, respectively, significantly inhibited BMP-2-induced motility and invasiveness in association with the activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, BMP-2-induced MMP-9 expression and enzymatic activity was also significantly blocked by treatment with PI3K/AKT, ERK, or NF-κB inhibitors. Immunohistochemistry staining of 178 gastric tumor biopsies indicated that expression of BMP-2 and MMP-9 had a significant positive correlation with lymph node metastasis and a poor prognosis. These results indicate that the BMP-2 signaling pathway enhances tumor metastasis in gastric cancer by sequential activation of the PI3K/AKT or MAPK pathway followed by the induction of NF-κB and MMP-9 activity, indicating that BMP-2 has the potential to be a therapeutic molecular target to decrease metastasis.

Abstract: Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a key regulator of various transcription factors including p53 and CtBP in the DNA damage signaling pathway. PML-nuclear body (NB) is required for HIPK2-mediated p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 and induction of apoptosis. Although PML-NB targeting of HIPK2 has been shown, much is not clear about the molecular mechanism of HIPK2 recruitment to PML-NBs. Here we show that HIPK2 colocalizes specifically with PML-I and PML-IV. Mutational analysis showed that HIPK2 recruitment to PML-IV-NBs is mediated by the SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) of both PML-IV and HIPK2. Wild-type HIPK2 associated with SUMO-conjugated PML-IV at a higher affinity than with un-conjugated PML-IV, while the association of a HIPK2 SIM mutant with SUMO-modified PML-IV was impaired. In colony formation assays, HIPK2 strongly suppressed cell proliferation, but HIPK2 SIM mutants did not. In addition, activation and phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser46 residue were impaired by HIPK2 SIM mutants. These results suggest that SIM-mediated HIPK2 targeting to PML-NBs is crucial for HIPK2-mediated p53 activation and induction of apoptosis.

Abstract: In an attempt to find new types of anti-hypoxic agents from herbs, we identified 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF) as a natural agent that fulfills the criterion. 5-HMF, the final product of carbohydrate metabolism, has favorable biological effects such as anti-oxidant activity and inhibiting sickling of red blood cells. The role of 5-HMF in hypoxia, however, is not yet. Our pilot results showed that pretreatment with 5-HMF markedly increased both the survival time and the survival rate of mice under hypoxic stress. The present study was aimed to further investigate the protective role of 5-HMF and the underlying mechanisms in hypoxic injury using ECV304 cells as an in vitro model. ECV304 cells pretreated with or without 5-HMF for 1 h were exposed to hypoxic condition (0.3% O2) for 24 h and then cell apoptosis, necrosis, the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the expressions of phosphorylation- extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were investigated. Pretreatment with 5-HMF markedly attenuated hypoxia-induced cell necrosis and apoptosis at late stage (p < 0.01). Furthermore, pretreatment with 5-HMF rescued both the decline of the MMP and the increase of p-ERK protein under hypoxia. In a word, these results indicated that 5-HMF had protective effects against hypoxic injury in ECV304 cells, and its effects on MMP and p-ERK may be involved in the mechanism.

Abstract: We studied the susceptibility of human embryonic stem cells and derived contractile embryoid bodies from WAO9, HUES-5 and HUES-16 cell lines to Coxsackievirus B infection. After validating stem cell-like properties and cardiac phenotype, Coxsackievirus B receptors CAR and DAF, as well as type I interferon receptors were detected in all cell lines and differentiation stages studied. Real-time PCR analysis showed that CAR mRNA levels were 3.4-fold higher in undifferentiated cells, while DAF transcript levels were 2.78-fold more abundant in differentiated cultures (P<0.05). All cell lines were susceptible to Coxsackievirus serotypes B1-5 infection as shown by RT-PCR detection of viral RNA, immunofluorescence detection of viral protein and infectivity titration of cell culture supernatants resulting in cell death. Supernatants infectivity titers 24-48h post-infection ranged from 105-106 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml, the highest titers were detected in undifferentiated cells. Cell viability detected by a colorimetric assay, showed inverse correlation with infectivity titers of cell culture supernatants. Treatment with 100 U of interferon Iβ significantly reduced viral replication and associated cell death during a 24–48 h observation period, as detected by reduced infectivity titers in the supernatants and increased cell viability by a colorimetric assay, respectively. We propose human embryonic stem cell and derived contractile embryoid bodies as a valid model to study cardiac Coxsackievirus B infection.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) suppress T cell responses through mechanisms not completely understood. Adenosine is a strong immunosuppressant that acts mainly through its receptor A2a (ADORA2A). Extracellular adenosine levels are a net result of its production (mediated by CD39 and CD73), and of its conversion into inosine by Adenosine Deaminase (ADA). Here we investigated the involvement of ADO in the immunomodulation promoted by MSCs. Human T lymphocytes were activated and cultured with or without MSCs. Compared to lymphocytes cultured without MSCs, co-cultured lymphocytes were suppressed and expressed higher levels of ADORA2A and lower levels of ADA. In co-cultures, the percentage of MSCs expressing CD39, and of T lymphocytes expressing CD73, increased significantly and adenosine levels were higher. Incubation of MSCs with media conditioned by activated T lymphocytes induced the production of adenosine to levels similar to those observed in co-cultures, indicating that adenosine production was mainly derived from MSCs. Finally, blocking ADORA2A signaling raised lymphocyte proliferation significantly. Our results suggest that some of the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs may, in part, be mediated through the modulation of components related to adenosine signaling. These findings may open new avenues for the development of new treatments for GVHD and other inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Disruption of cell–extracellular matrix interaction causes epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis called anoikis, and resistance to anoikis has been suggested to be a critical step for cancer cells to metastasize. EphA2 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, and recent studies have found that overexpression of EphA2 contributes to malignant cellular behavior, including resistance to anoikis, in several different types of cancer cells. Here we show that Ephexin4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase RhoG that interacts with EphA2, plays an important role in the regulation of anoikis. Knockdown of Ephexin4 promoted anoikis in HeLa cells, and experiments using a knockdown-rescue approach showed that activation of RhoG, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt was required for the Ephexin4-mediated suppression of anoikis. Indeed, Ephexin4 knockdown caused a decrease in RhoG activity and Akt phosphorylation in HeLa cells cultured in suspension. In addition, Ephexin4 was involved in the EphA2-mediated suppression of anoikis. Taken together, these results suggest that Ephexin4 mediates resistance to anoikis through activation of RhoG and PI3K downstream of EphA2.

Novel interactions of ankyrins-G at the costameres: The muscle-specific Obscurin/Titin-Binding-related Domain (OTBD) binds plectin and filamin C,

Abstract: Ankyrins, the adapters of the spectrin skeleton, are involved in local accumulation and stabilization of integral proteins to the appropriate membrane domains. In striated muscle, tissue-dependent alternative splicing generates unique Ank3 gene products (ankyrins-G); they share the Obscurin/Titin-Binding-related Domain (OTBD), a muscle-specific insert of the C-terminal domain which is highly conserved among ankyrin genes, and binds obscurin and titin to Ank1 gene products. We previously proposed that OTBD sequences constitute a novel domain of protein–protein interactions which confers ankyrins with specific cellular functions in muscle. Here we searched for muscle proteins binding to ankyrin-G OTBD by yeast two hybrid assay, and we found plectin and filamin C, two organizing elements of the cytoskeleton with essential roles in myogenesis, muscle cell cytoarchitecture, and muscle disease. The three proteins coimmunoprecipitate from skeletal muscle extracts and colocalize at costameres in adult muscle fibers. During in vitro myogenesis, muscle ankyrins-G are first expressed in postmitotic myocytes undergoing fusion to myotubes. In western blots of subcellular fractions from C2C12 cells, the majority of muscle ankyrins-G appear associated with membrane compartments. Occasional but not extensive co-localization at nascent costameres suggested that ankyrin-G interactions with plectin and filamin C are not involved in costamere assembly; they would rather reinforce stability and/or modulate molecular interactions in sarcolemma microdomains by establishing novel links between muscle-specific ankyrins-G and the two costameric dystrophin-associated glycoprotein and integrin-based protein complexes. These results report the first protein–protein interactions involving the ankyrin-G OTBD domain and support the hypothesis that OTBD sequences confer ankyrins with a gain of function in vertebrates, bringing further consolidation and resilience of the linkage between sarcomeres and sarcolemma.
