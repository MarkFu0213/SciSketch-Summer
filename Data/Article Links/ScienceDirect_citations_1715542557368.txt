Abstract: Although the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is present throughout axons, and IP3 and ryanodine receptors are widely expressed in nerve terminals, whether Ca2+ release from presynaptic stores contributes to action potential (AP)-evoked Ca2+ transients remains controversial. We investigated the release of Ca2+ from ER stores in boutons en passant of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. A hallmark of these stores is that they spontaneously release Ca2+ at a low frequency. Using a high-affinity Ca2+ indicator, we documented and characterised such spontaneous Ca2+ transients (sCaTs), which occurred at a rate of ~0.2 per min and raised the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by ~2 µM in the absence of exogenous buffers. Caffeine increased the average frequency of sCaTs by 90%, without affecting their amplitude and decay kinetics. Therefore, presynaptic ryanodine receptors were likely involved. To determine if presynaptic ER stores contribute to intracellular Ca2+ accumulation during repetitive stimulation, we measured [Ca2+]i during 2 s long trains of APs evoked at 10–50 Hz. We found that for frequencies <20 Hz, [Ca2+]i reached a steady state within ~500 ms after stimulation onset. However, for higher frequencies, [Ca2+]i continued to increase with AP number, suggesting that the rate of Ca2+ entry exceeded the rate of clearance. Comparison between measured and predicted values indicates supralinear summation of Ca2+. Block of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase reduced the supralinearity of summation, without reducing the amplitude of a single AP-evoked Ca2+ transient. Together, our results implicate presynaptic ER stores as a source of Ca2+ during repetitive stimulation.

Abstract: During spermatogenesis, the transition from histone to protamine is highly conserved in most invertebrates and vertebrates. Thus far, a large and growing body of literature has demonstrated that histones and histone modifications still exist in the sperm nucleus of decapod crustaceans. H4Kac is believed to play an important role in the process of sperm chromatin condensation. However, the dynamics of hyperacetylated histone H4 (H4Kac) during spermatogenesis in decapoda are still unknown. In this paper, the distribution of H4Kac in four decapod crustaceans (Eriocheir sinensis, Charybdis japonica, Procambarus clarkii, and Macrobrachium nipponense) were investigated via immunofluorescence. Our results indicated that H4Kac was visible in the mature sperm nucleus of E. sinensis, C. japonica, and M. nipponense. Unlike the other three species, H4Kac was translocated from the nuclei to cytoplasm in mid-spermatids of P. clarkii. Eventually, H4Kac were not present in mature spermatozoa of P. clarkii. Importantly, we observed for the first time that H4Kac was distributed outside the nucleus, which reminds us that H4Kac may participate in the formation of acrosome structure in decapod crustaceans and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin decondensation.

Abstract: Summary
Heme is an iron-containing porphyrin of vital importance for cell energetic metabolism. High rates of heme synthesis are commonly observed in proliferating cells. Moreover, the cell-surface heme exporter feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1a (FLVCR1a) is overexpressed in several tumor types. However, the reasons why heme synthesis and export are enhanced in highly proliferating cells remain unknown. Here, we illustrate a functional axis between heme synthesis and heme export: heme efflux through the plasma membrane sustains heme synthesis, and implementation of the two processes down-modulates the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and oxidative phosphorylation. Conversely, inhibition of heme export reduces heme synthesis and promotes the TCA cycle fueling and flux as well as oxidative phosphorylation. These data indicate that the heme synthesis-export system modulates the TCA cycle and oxidative metabolism and provide a mechanistic basis for the observation that both processes are enhanced in cells with high-energy demand.

Abstract: Intestinal microvascular endothelial cell (IMVEC) is a fundamental and essential component of gut-vascular barrier which is closely associated with intestinal disorders However, there is still a lack of established intestinal microvascular endothelial cell line. In the present study, a newly established rat intestinal microvascular endothelial cell line termed RIMVEC-11 was described and characterized which has been stably cultured for more than 90 passages so far. RIMVEC-11 was characterized by endothelial features with the cobblestone morphology under light microscopy, the Weibel-Palade body and rich vesicles in the cytoplasm on the ultrastructural level, and positive endothelial specific markers CD31 and von Willebrand factor by immunocytochemistry analysis. Meanwhile, RIMVEC-11 maintained the fundamental physiological function of the microvascular endothelial cells. Tube formation assay confirmed that RIMVEC-11 retained the potential for capillaries formation. Scratch assay confirmed the endothelial cell migration potential of RIMVEC-11. Thus, a novel IMVEC cell line RIMVEC-11 was established, which could be used as a promising model for the gut-vascular barrier research.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoinositides are important molecules in lipid signaling, membrane identity, and trafficking that are spatiotemporally controlled by factors from both mammalian cells and intracellular pathogens. Here, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases, we screen for regulators of the host innate defense response to intracellular bacterial replication. We identify SAC1, a transmembrane phosphoinositide phosphatase, as an essential regulator of xenophagy. Depletion or inactivation of SAC1 compromises fusion between Salmonella-containing autophagosomes and lysosomes, leading to increased bacterial replication. Mechanistically, the loss of SAC1 results in aberrant accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] on Salmonella-containing autophagosomes, thus facilitating recruitment of SteA, a PI(4)P-binding Salmonella effector protein, which impedes lysosomal fusion. Replication of Salmonella lacking SteA is suppressed by SAC-1-deficient cells, however, demonstrating bacterial adaptation to xenophagy. Our findings uncover a paradigm in which a host protein regulates the level of its substrate and impairs the function of a bacterial effector during xenophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed to stop the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We construct a series of live attenuated vaccine candidates by large-scale recoding of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and assess their safety and efficacy in Syrian hamsters. Animals were vaccinated with a single dose of the respective recoded virus and challenged 21 days later. Two of the tested viruses do not cause clinical symptoms but are highly immunogenic and induce strong protective immunity. Attenuated viruses replicate efficiently in the upper but not in the lower airways, causing only mild pulmonary histopathology. After challenge, hamsters develop no signs of disease and rapidly clear challenge virus: at no time could infectious virus be recovered from the lungs of infected animals. The ease with which attenuated virus candidates can be produced and administered favors their further development as vaccines to combat the ongoing pandemic.

Abstract: Summary
Our study details the stepwise evolution of gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.

An in vitro analysis of the effect of hyperosmolarity on the chondrogenic potential of human articular cartilage derived chondroprogenitors,

Abstract: Purpose
Chondroprogenitors display promise for articular cartilage regeneration. It is imperative to standardize culture conditions, to further enhance chondrogenicity and reduce tendency for hypertrophy. Cartilage matrix provides a unique hyperosmolar microenvironment that enables native cells to resist compressive stress. However, commonly used culture media have osmolarities relatively hypoosmotic when compared to in-vivo conditions. Previous reports involving chondrocytes demonstrated enhanced chondrogenic potential secondary to utilization of hyperosmolar culture conditions. The study aimed to assess the effect of hyperosmolarity (either mimicking normal joint conditions or short-term hyperosmotic stress) on chondroprogenitor phenotype.
Materials and methods
Fibronectin adhesion assay derived human articular chondroprogenitors (n = 3) were divided into 3 groups: a) Control: cells grown in standard culture conditions (320 mOsm/L), b) Test A: cells grown in hyperosmolar media mimicking joint conditions (409 mOsm/L) and c) Test B: cells exposed to short-term hyperosmotic stress (504 mOsm/L) for 24 h, prior to assessment. Evaluation parameters included population doubling, cell size, surface marker expression, mRNA expression (markers of chondrogenesis, dedifferentiation and hypertrophy) and multilineage potential.
Results
Subjecting these cells to increased osmolarity in culture did not demonstrably favor chondrogenesis (control vs Test A: comparable COL2A1) while hyperosmotic stress further increased the tendency for hypertrophy and terminal differentiation (high COL1A1 and low COL2A1, P = 0.006). Additionally, growth kinetics, surface marker expression and multilineage potential were comparable across groups.
Conclusion
Chondroprogenitors displayed sensitivity to increase in osmolarity as chondrogenic phenotype did not improve, while hypertrophic propensity was heightened, although further analysis of culture and phenotypic parameters will aid in optimizing chondroprogenitor use in cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 play a pathogenic role in cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by producing oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate (α-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1 and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2 is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenes can alter metabolism by changing the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. However, how oncogenes regulate tumor cell biomass remains poorly understood. Using isogenic MCF10A cells transformed with nine different oncogenes, we show that specific oncogenes reduce the biomass of cancer cells by promoting extracellular vesicle (EV) release. While MYC and AURKB elicited the highest number of EVs, each oncogene selectively altered the protein composition of released EVs. Likewise, oncogenes alter secreted miRNAs. MYC-overexpressing cells require ceramide, whereas AURKB requires ESCRT to release high levels of EVs. We identify an inverse relationship between MYC upregulation and activation of the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway for regulating EV release in some tumor cells. Finally, lysosome genes and activity are downregulated in the context of MYC and AURKB, suggesting that cellular contents, instead of being degraded, were released via EVs. Thus, oncogene-mediated biomass regulation via differential EV release is a new metabolic phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal sclerosis, the major neuropathological hallmark of temporal lobe epilepsy, is characterized by different patterns of neuronal loss. The mechanisms of cell-type-specific vulnerability and their progression and histopathological classification remain controversial. Using single-cell electrophysiology in vivo and immediate-early gene expression, we reveal that superficial CA1 pyramidal neurons are overactive in epileptic rodents. Bulk tissue and single-nucleus expression profiling disclose sublayer-specific transcriptomic signatures and robust microglial pro-inflammatory responses. Transcripts regulating neuronal processes such as voltage channels, synaptic signaling, and cell adhesion are deregulated differently by epilepsy across sublayers, whereas neurodegenerative signatures primarily involve superficial cells. Pseudotime analysis of gene expression in single nuclei and in situ validation reveal separated trajectories from health to epilepsy across cell types and identify a subset of superficial cells undergoing a later stage in neurodegeneration. Our findings indicate that sublayer- and cell-type-specific changes associated with selective CA1 neuronal damage contribute to progression of hippocampal sclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
eIF4F plays diverse roles in human cancers, which complicate the development of an overarching understanding of its functional and regulatory impacts across tumor types. Typically, eIF4F drives initiation from the mRNA 5′ end (cap) and is composed of eIF4G1, eIF4A1, and cap-binding eIF4E. Cap-independent initiation is possible without eIF4E, from internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). By analyzing large public datasets, we found that cancers selectively overexpress EIF4G1 more than EIF4E. That expression imbalance supports EIF4G1 as a prognostic indicator in patients with cancer. It also attenuates “housekeeping” pathways that are usually regulated in a tissue-specific manner via cap-dependent initiation in healthy tissues and reinforce regulation of cancer-preferred pathways in cap-independent contexts. Cap-independent initiation is mechanistically attributable to eIF4G1 hyperphosphorylation that promotes binding to eIF4A1 and reduced eIF4E availability. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel model of dysregulated eIF4F function and highlight the clinical relevance of cap-(in)dependent initiation in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Fusion transcripts or RNAs have been found in both disordered and healthy human tissues and cells; however, their physiological functions in the brain development remain unknown. In the analysis of deposited RNA-sequence libraries covering early to middle embryonic stages, we identify 1,055 fusion transcripts present in the developing neocortex. Interestingly, 98 fusion transcripts exhibit distinct expression patterns in various neural progenitors (NPs) or neurons. We focus on CTNNBIP1-CLSTN1 (CTCL), which is enriched in outer radial glial cells that contribute to cortex expansion during human evolution. Intriguingly, downregulation of CTCL in cultured human cerebral organoids causes marked reduction in NPs and precocious neuronal differentiation, leading to impairment of organoid growth. Furthermore, the expression of CTCL fine-tunes Wnt/β-catenin signaling that controls cortex patterning. Together, this work provides evidence indicating important roles of fusion transcript in human brain development and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Phase variation is a common mechanism for creating phenotypic heterogeneity of surface structures in bacteria important for niche adaptation. In Campylobacter, phase variation occurs by random variation in hypermutable homonucleotide 7–11 G (polyG) tracts. To elucidate how phages adapt to phase-variable hosts, we study Fletchervirus phages infecting Campylobacter dependent on a phase-variable receptor. Our data demonstrate that Fletcherviruses mimic their host and encode hypermutable polyG tracts, leading to phase-variable expression of two of four receptor-binding proteins. This creates phenotypically diverse phage populations, including a sub-population that infects the bacterial host when the phase-variable receptor is not expressed. Such population dynamics of both phage and host promote co-existence in a shared niche. Strikingly, we identify polyG tracts in more than 100 phage genera, infecting more than 70 bacterial species. Future experimental work may confirm phase variation as a widespread strategy for creating phenotypically diverse phage populations.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involve the aggregation of secreted proteins. However, it is largely unclear how secretory-pathway proteins contribute to amyloid formation. We developed a systems biology framework integrating expression data with protein-protein interaction networks to estimate a tissue’s fitness for producing specific secreted proteins and analyzed the fitness of the secretory pathway of various brain regions and cell types for synthesizing the AD-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP). While key amyloidogenic pathway components were not differentially expressed in AD brains, we found Aβ deposition correlates with systemic down- and upregulation of the secretory-pathway components proximal to APP and amyloidogenic secretases, respectively, in AD. Our analyses suggest that perturbations from three AD risk loci cascade through the APP secretory-support network and into the endocytosis pathway, connecting amyloidogenesis to dysregulation of secretory-pathway components supporting APP and suggesting novel therapeutic targets for AD. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: P-Element-induced wimpy testis (Piwi) subfamily proteins form complexes that bind to Piwi-interacting RNA. This interaction is crucial for stem cell regulation and formation, maintenance of germline stem cells, and gametogenesis in several metazoans. Planarians are effective models for studying stem cells. In the planarian Dugesia ryukyuensis, DrPiwi-1 is essential for the development of germ cells, but not somatic cells and sexual organs. DrPiwi-2 is indispensable for regeneration. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Piwi on the differentiation of germ cells using monoclonal antibodies against DrPiwi-1 and DrPiwi-2. DrPiwi-1 and DrPiwi-2 co-localized more in immature germ cells than in mature germ cells in the ovary. DrPiwi-1 was found in the cytoplasm of early oogonia as undifferentiated germ cells, whereas DrPiwi-2 was found to localize not only in the nuclei but also in the cytoplasm of early oogonia. In descendant germ cells (oocytes), DrPiwi-2 was not present in the cytoplasm, but was strongly detected in the nucleolus. Moreover, we found that DrPiwi-1 forms a complex with DrPiwi-2. The cause of DrPiwi-1 depletion may be the severe reduction in the DrPiwi-2 level in the cytoplasm of oogonia. These results suggest that the formation of the DrPiwi-1 and DrPiwi-2 complex in the cytoplasm of oogonia is essential for oocyte differentiation. Our findings support the conclusion that DrPiwi-1 forms a complex with DrPiwi-2 in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated germ cells, and it signifies the start of gametogenesis. In contrast, in the testes, Drpiwi-1 was found in undifferentiated germ cells (spermatogonia), whereas DrPiwi-2 was found in descendant germ cells (spermatocytes). The process of germ cell differentiation from adult stem cells in planarians may be regulated in different ways in female and male germ lines by the Piwi family.

Abstract: Summary
B cell responses are critical for antiviral immunity. However, a comprehensive picture of antigen-specific B cell differentiation, clonal proliferation, and dynamics in different organs after infection is lacking. Here, by combining single-cell RNA and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing of antigen-specific cells in lymph nodes, spleen, and lungs after influenza infection in mice, we identify several germinal center (GC) B cell subpopulations and organ-specific differences that persist over the course of the response. We discover transcriptional differences between memory cells in lungs and lymphoid organs and organ-restricted clonal expansion. Remarkably, we find significant clonal overlap between GC-derived memory and plasma cells. By combining BCR-mutational analyses with monoclonal antibody (mAb) expression and affinity measurements, we find that memory B cells are highly diverse and can be selected from both low- and high-affinity precursors. By linking antigen recognition with transcriptional programming, clonal proliferation, and differentiation, these finding provide important advances in our understanding of antiviral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The contribution of cellular heterogeneity and architecture to white adipose tissue (WAT) function is poorly understood. Herein, we combined spatially resolved transcriptional profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing and image analyses to map human WAT composition and structure. This identified 18 cell classes with unique propensities to form spatially organized homo- and heterotypic clusters. Of these, three constituted mature adipocytes that were similar in size, but distinct in their spatial arrangements and transcriptional profiles. Based on marker genes, we termed these AdipoLEP, AdipoPLIN, and AdipoSAA. We confirmed, in independent datasets, that their respective gene profiles associated differently with both adipocyte and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Corroborating our observations, insulin stimulation in vivo by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp showed that only AdipoPLIN displayed a transcriptional response to insulin. Altogether, by mining this multimodal resource we identify that human WAT is composed of three classes of mature adipocytes, only one of which is insulin responsive.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence is characterized as a stable proliferation arrest that can be triggered by multiple stresses. Most knowledge about senescent cells is obtained from studies in primary cells. However, senescence features may be different in cancer cells, since the pathways that are involved in senescence induction are often deregulated in cancer. We report here a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and senolytic responses in a panel of 13 cancer cell lines rendered senescent by two distinct compounds. We show that in cancer cells, the response to senolytic agents and the composition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype are more influenced by the cell of origin than by the senescence trigger. Using machine learning, we establish the SENCAN gene expression classifier for the detection of senescence in cancer cell samples. The expression profiles and senescence classifier are available as an interactive online Cancer SENESCopedia.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system of skin develops in stages in mice. However, the developmental dynamics of immune cells in human skin remains elusive. Here, we perform transcriptome profiling of CD45+ hematopoietic cells in human fetal skin at an estimated gestational age of 10–17 weeks by single-cell RNA sequencing. A total of 13 immune cell types are identified. Skin macrophages show dynamic heterogeneity over the course of skin development. A major shift in lymphoid cell developmental states occurs from the first to the second trimester that implies an in situ differentiation process. Gene expression analysis reveals a typical developmental program in immune cells in accordance with their functional maturation, possibly involving metabolic reprogramming. Finally, we identify transcription factors (TFs) that potentially regulate cellular transitions by comparing TFs and TF target gene networks. These findings provide detailed insight into how the immune system of the human skin is established during development.

Abstract: Micro-RNA (miRNA)-based regulation of hypoxia, angiogenesis and tumour growth provides promising targets for effective therapy in malignant glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Accumulating evidence suggests a potential role of melatonin in miRNA expression in cancer cells. Despite these findings, the melatonin–miRNA interaction in GBM and the effect of this interaction on GBM tumour development and invasion are not clearly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of melatonin on human GBM tumour spheroid tumorigenesis and invasion in vitro, and to analyse the interaction between 36 angio-miRNAs and the HIF1/VEGF/MMP9 axis, which is known to be associated with the antitumour effect of melatonin. We found that melatonin is able to selectively induce cell death in single-layer U87-MG cells (a GBM cell line) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as characterized by MTT assay. The use of tumour spheroids and a Matrigel invasion assay revealed that melatonin impairs tumorigenesis, and it significantly reduced both the tumour spheroid area and invasion rate, especially at the 0.5 mM and 1 mM concentrations. This inhibition was accompanied by strong reductions in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression and protein levels in GBM tumour spheroids. In addition, melatonin significantly reduced the relative gene expression and protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). This study revealed that six differentially expressed angio-miRs (miR-15b, miR-18a-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-130a-5p, miR-200b-3p) may play important roles in GBM tumorigenesis and invasion, and all respond to melatonin therapy. Our results suggest that melatonin inhibits tumorigenesis and invasion of human GBM tumour spheroids, possibly by suppressing HIF1-α/VEGF/MMP9 signalling via regulation of angio-miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI proteins and their guiding Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) are crucial for fertility and transposon defense in the animal germline. In most species, the majority of piRNAs are produced from distinct large genomic loci, called piRNA clusters. It is assumed that germline-expressed piRNA clusters, particularly in Drosophila, act as principal regulators to control transposons dispersed across the genome. Here, using synteny analysis, we show that large clusters are evolutionarily labile, arise at loci characterized by recurrent chromosomal rearrangements, and are mostly species-specific across the Drosophila genus. By engineering chromosomal deletions in D. melanogaster, we demonstrate that the three largest germline clusters, which account for the accumulation of >40% of all transposon-targeting piRNAs in ovaries, are neither required for fertility nor for transposon regulation in trans. We provide further evidence that dispersed elements, rather than the regulatory action of large Drosophila germline clusters in trans, may be central for transposon defense.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale studies of human gut microbiomes have revealed broad differences in composition across geographically distinct populations. Yet, studies examining impacts of microbiome composition on various health outcomes typically focus on single populations, posing the question of whether compositional differences between populations translate into differences in susceptibility. Using germ-free mice humanized with microbiome samples from 30 donors representing three countries, we observe robust differences in susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium, a model for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infections, according to geographic origin. We do not see similar responses to Listeria monocytogenes infections. We further find that cohousing the most susceptible and most resistant mice confers protection from C. rodentium infection. This work underscores the importance of increasing global participation in microbiome studies related to health outcomes. Diverse cohorts are needed to identify both population-specific responses to specific microbiome interventions and to achieve broader-reaching biological conclusions that generalize across populations.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an essential catabolic process induced to provide cellular energy sources in response to nutrient limitation through the activation of kinases, like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1. Although glucose starvation induces autophagy, the exact mechanism underlying this signaling has yet to be elucidated. Here, we reveal a role for ULK1 in non-canonical autophagy signaling using diverse cell lines. ULK1 activated by AMPK during glucose starvation phosphorylates the lipid kinase PIKfyve on S1548, thereby increasing its activity and the synthesis of the phospholipid PI(5)P without changing the levels of PI(3,5)P2. ULK1-mediated activation of PIKfyve enhances the formation of PI(5)P-containing autophagosomes upon glucose starvation, resulting in an increase in autophagy flux. Phospho-mimic PIKfyve S1548D drives autophagy upregulation and lowers autophagy substrate levels. Our study has identified how ULK1 upregulates autophagy upon glucose starvation and induces the formation of PI(5)P-containing autophagosomes by activating PIKfyve.

Abstract: The liver has multiple functions that change throughout ontogeny. South American camelids (SAC) have unique characteristics related to adaptation to extreme environments and metabolism. However, the process of hepatic cell differentiation has not been studied in any SAC. We study the patterns of cell differentiation and proliferation in the liver of the alpaca at different times of the ontogeny, excluding the hematopoietic components. Immunohistochemical techniques were performed in 66 specimens, including embryos, fetuses, neonates and adults. Supplementary analyses were performed by lectinhistochemistry. The hepatocytic differentiation was performed by the identification of Hepatocyte (Clone: ​​OCH1ES Dako®). It began in the specimens of 1.8−2.5 cm of crown to rump length (CRL), from Days 25–29 (ovulation = Day 0), continued during gestation and intensified towards its end. The cholangiocytic differentiation was performed by the identification of cytokeratin 7 (CK7, Dako®). It was manifested at the final of gestation (specimens of 28.4 cm CRL, from Day 223 onwards). Parenchymal cells underwent a process of gradual differentiation (differentiation of hepatocytes preceded that of cholangiocytes). Cell proliferation was observed along gestation using the nuclear proliferation antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67. Hepatic organogenesis in the alpacas shares similar differentiation and proliferation mechanisms with other altricial, but phylogenetically distant, species.

Abstract: Summary
Host adaptive mutations in the influenza A virus (IAV) PB2 protein are critical for human infection, but their molecular action is not well understood. We observe that when IAV containing avian PB2 infects mammalian cells, viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) aggregates that localize to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) are formed. These vRNP aggregates resemble LC3B-associated autophagosome structures, with aggresome-like properties, in that they cause the re-distribution of vimentin. However, electron microscopy reveals that these aggregates represent an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. Compared to mammalian-PB2 virus, avian-PB2 virus induces higher autophagic flux in infected cells, indicating an increased rate of autophagosomes containing avian vRNPs fusing with lysosomes. We found that p62 is essential for the formation of vRNP aggregates and that the Raptor-interacting region of p62 is required for interaction with vRNPs through the PB2 polymerase subunit. Selective autophagic sequestration during late-stage virus replication is thus an additional strategy for host restriction of avian-PB2 IAV.

Abstract: Summary
Memory B cells seem to be more durable than antibodies and thus crucial for the long-term immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Here we investigate SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells and their dependence on CD4+ T cell help in different settings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Compared with severely ill individuals, those who recovered from mild COVID-19 develop fewer but functionally superior spike-specific memory B cells. Generation and affinity maturation of these cells is best associated with IL-21+CD4+ T cells in recovered individuals and CD40L+CD4+ T cells in severely ill individuals. The increased activation and exhaustion of memory B cells observed during COVID-19 correlates with CD4+ T cell functions. Intriguingly, CD4+ T cells recognizing membrane protein show a stronger association with spike-specific memory B cells than those recognizing spike or nucleocapsid proteins. Overall, we identify CD4+ T cell subsets associated with the generation of B cell memory during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
The activity of the SMN complex in promoting the assembly of pre-mRNA processing UsnRNPs correlates with condensation of the complex in nuclear Cajal bodies. While mechanistic details of its activity have been elucidated, the molecular basis for condensation remains unclear. High SMN complex phosphorylation suggests extensive regulation. Here, we report on systematic siRNA-based screening for modulators of the capacity of SMN to condense in Cajal bodies and identify mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase β-1 as key regulators. Proteomic analysis reveals TOR-dependent phosphorylations in SMN complex subunits. Using stably expressed or optogenetically controlled phospho mutants, we demonstrate that serine 49 and 63 phosphorylation of human SMN controls the capacity of the complex to condense in Cajal bodies via liquid-liquid phase separation. Our findings link SMN complex condensation and UsnRNP biogenesis to cellular energy levels and suggest modulation of TOR signaling as a rational concept for therapy of the SMN-linked neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved outcomes in some cancers. A major limitation of ICB is that most patients fail to respond, which is partly attributable to immunosuppression. Obesity appears to improve immune checkpoint therapies in some cancers, but impacts on breast cancer (BC) remain unknown. In lean and obese mice, tumor progression and immune reprogramming were quantified in BC tumors treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or control. Obesity augments tumor incidence and progression. Anti-PD-1 induces regression in lean mice and potently abrogates progression in obese mice. BC primes systemic immunity to be highly responsive to obesity, leading to greater immunosuppression, which may explain greater anti-PD-1 efficacy. Anti-PD-1 significantly reinvigorates antitumor immunity despite persistent obesity. Laminin subunit beta-2 (Lamb2), downregulated by anti-PD-1, significantly predicts patient survival. Lastly, a microbial signature associated with anti-PD-1 efficacy is identified. Thus, anti-PD-1 is highly efficacious in obese mice by reinvigorating durable antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Coronaviruses have evolved elaborate multisubunit machines to replicate and transcribe their genomes. Central to these machines are the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit (nsp12) and its intimately associated cofactors (nsp7 and nsp8). We use a high-throughput magnetic-tweezers approach to develop a mechanochemical description of this core polymerase. The core polymerase exists in at least three catalytically distinct conformations, one being kinetically consistent with incorporation of incorrect nucleotides. We provide evidence that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) uses a thermal ratchet instead of a power stroke to transition from the pre- to post-translocated state. Ultra-stable magnetic tweezers enable the direct observation of coronavirus polymerase deep and long-lived backtracking that is strongly stimulated by secondary structures in the template. The framework we present here elucidates one of the most important structure-dynamics-function relationships in human health today and will form the grounds for understanding the regulation of this complex.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms that govern the choreographed timing of organ development remain poorly understood. Our investigation of the role of the Lin28a and Lin28b paralogs during the developmental process of branching morphogenesis establishes that dysregulation of Lin28a/b leads to abnormal branching morphogenesis in the lung and other tissues. Additionally, we find that the Lin28 paralogs, which regulate post-transcriptional processing of both mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), predominantly control mRNAs during the initial phases of lung organogenesis. Target mRNAs include Sox2, Sox9, and Etv5, which coordinate lung development and differentiation. Moreover, we find that functional interactions between Lin28a and Sox9 are capable of bypassing branching defects in Lin28a/b mutant lungs. Here, we identify Lin28a and Lin28b as regulators of early embryonic lung development, highlighting the importance of the timing of post-transcriptional regulation of both miRNAs and mRNAs at distinct stages of organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Novel treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) are urgently needed to improve patient outcome. Here, we screen a library of non-characterized small molecules against a heterogeneous collection of patient-derived CRC spheroids. By prioritizing compounds with inhibitory activity in a subset of—but not all—spheroid cultures, NCT02 is identified as a candidate with minimal risk of non-specific toxicity. Mechanistically, we show that NCT02 acts as molecular glue that induces ubiquitination of cyclin K (CCNK) and proteasomal degradation of CCNK and its complex partner CDK12. Knockout of CCNK or CDK12 decreases proliferation of CRC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, sensitivity to pharmacological CCNK/CDK12 degradation is associated with TP53 deficiency and consensus molecular subtype 4 in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts. We thus demonstrate the efficacy of targeted CCNK/CDK12 degradation for a CRC subset, highlighting the potential of drug-induced proteolysis for difficult-to-treat types of cancer.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has been a remarkable clinical advance for cancer; however, the majority of patients do not respond to ICB therapy. We show that metastatic disease in the pleural and peritoneal cavities is associated with poor clinical outcomes after ICB therapy. Cavity-resident macrophages express high levels of Tim-4, a receptor for phosphatidylserine (PS), and this is associated with reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells with tumor-reactive features in pleural effusions and peritoneal ascites from patients with cancer. We mechanistically demonstrate that viable and cytotoxic anti-tumor CD8+ T cells upregulate PS and this renders them susceptible to sequestration away from tumor targets and proliferation suppression by Tim-4+ macrophages. Tim-4 blockade abrogates this sequestration and proliferation suppression and enhances anti-tumor efficacy in models of anti-PD-1 therapy and adoptive T cell therapy in mice. Thus, Tim-4+ cavity-resident macrophages limit the efficacy of immunotherapies in these microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
RelA-SpoT Homolog (RSH) enzymes control bacterial physiology through synthesis and degradation of the nucleotide alarmone (p)ppGpp. We recently discovered multiple families of small alarmone synthetase (SAS) RSH acting as toxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, with the FaRel subfamily of toxSAS abrogating bacterial growth by producing an analog of (p)ppGpp, (pp)pApp. Here we probe the mechanism of growth arrest used by four experimentally unexplored subfamilies of toxSAS: FaRel2, PhRel, PhRel2, and CapRel. Surprisingly, all these toxins specifically inhibit protein synthesis. To do so, they transfer a pyrophosphate moiety from ATP to the tRNA 3′ CCA. The modification inhibits both tRNA aminoacylation and the sensing of cellular amino acid starvation by the ribosome-associated RSH RelA. Conversely, we show that some small alarmone hydrolase (SAH) RSH enzymes can reverse the pyrophosphorylation of tRNA to counter the growth inhibition by toxSAS. Collectively, we establish RSHs as RNA-modifying enzymes.

Abstract: Most animals face frequent periods of starvation throughout their entire life and thus need to appropriately adjust their behavior and metabolism during starvation for their survival. Such adaptive responses are regulated by a complex set of systemic signals, including hormones and neuropeptides. While much progress has been made in identifying pathways that regulate nutrient-excessive states, it is still incompletely understood how animals systemically signal their nutrient-deficient states. Here, we showed that the FMRFamide neuropeptide FLP-20 modulates a systemic starvation response in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that mutation of flp-20 rescued the starvation hypersensitivity of the G protein β-subunit gpb-2 mutants by suppressing excessive autophagy. FLP-20 acted in AIB neurons, where the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-2 also functions to modulate a systemic starvation response. Furthermore, FLP-20 modulated starvation-induced fat degradation in a manner dependent on the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-28. Collectively, our results reveal a circuit that senses and signals nutrient-deficient states to modulate a systemic starvation response in multicellular organisms.

Abstract: Summary
The heterogeneous nature of eukaryotic replication kinetics and the low efficiency of individual initiation sites make mapping the location and timing of replication initiation in human cells difficult. To address this challenge, we have developed optical replication mapping (ORM), a high-throughput single-molecule approach, and used it to map early-initiation events in human cells. The single-molecule nature of our data and a total of >2,500-fold coverage of the human genome on 27 million fibers averaging ∼300 kb in length allow us to identify initiation sites and their firing probability with high confidence. We find that the distribution of human replication initiation is consistent with inefficient, stochastic activation of heterogeneously distributed potential initiation complexes enriched in accessible chromatin. These observations are consistent with stochastic models of initiation-timing regulation and suggest that stochastic regulation of replication kinetics is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic replication, conserved from yeast to humans.

Abstract: Summary
Gene fragments derived from structural domains mediating physical interactions can modulate biological functions. Utilizing this, we developed lentiviral overexpression libraries of peptides comprehensively tiling high-confidence cancer driver genes. Toward inhibiting cancer growth, we assayed ~66,000 peptides, tiling 65 cancer drivers and 579 mutant alleles. Pooled fitness screens in two breast cancer cell lines revealed peptides, which selectively reduced cellular proliferation, implicating oncogenic protein domains important for cell fitness. Coupling of cell-penetrating motifs to these peptides enabled drug-like function, with peptides derived from EGFR and RAF1 inhibiting cell growth at IC50s of 27–63 μM. We anticipate that this peptide-tiling (PepTile) approach will enable rapid de novo mapping of bioactive protein domains and associated interfering peptides.

Abstract: Summary
MYC activates different metabolic programs in a cell-type- and cell-status-dependent manner. However, the role of MYC in inflammatory macrophages has not yet been determined. Metabolic and molecular analyses reveal that MYC, but not hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1), is involved in enhancing early glycolytic flux during inflammatory macrophage polarization. Ablation of MYC decreases lactate production by regulating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and causes increased inflammatory cytokines by regulating interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in response to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, myeloid-specific deletion of MYC and pharmacological inhibition of the MYC/LDH axis enhance inflammation and the bacterial clearance in vivo. These results elucidate the potential role of the MYC/LDH/IRF4 axis in inflammatory macrophages by connecting early glycolysis with inflammatory responses and suggest that modulating early glycolytic flux mediated by the MYC/LDH axis can be used to open avenues for the therapeutic modulation of macrophage polarization to fight against bacterial infection.

Abstract: Adherens junctions are a defining feature of all epithelial cells, providing cell-cell adhesion and contractile ring formation that is essential for cell and tissue morphology. In Drosophila, adherens junctions are concentrated between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, defined by aPKC-Par6-Baz and Lgl/Dlg/Scrib, respectively. Whether adherens junctions contribute to apical-basal polarization itself has been unclear because neuroblasts exhibit apical-basal polarization of aPKC-Par6-Baz and Lgl in the absence of adherens junctions. Here we show that, upon disruption of adherens junctions in epithelial cells, apical polarity determinants such as aPKC can still segregate from basolateral Lgl, but lose their sharp boundaries and also overlap with Dlg and Scrib – similar to neuroblasts. In addition, control of apical versus basolateral domain size is lost, along with control of cell shape, in the absence of adherens junctions. Manipulating the levels of apical Par3/Baz or basolateral Lgl polarity determinants in experiments and in computer simulations confirms that adherens junctions provide a ‘picket fence’ diffusion barrier that restricts the spread of polarity determinants along the membrane to enable precise domain size control. Movement of adherens junctions in response to mechanical forces during morphogenetic change thus enables spontaneous adjustment of apical versus basolateral domain size as an emergent property of the polarising system.

Abstract: In the present study, we have investigated the ultrastructures of the mature gonadal spermatozoa of R. variegata and T. literatus and presented comparisons with the Manila clam, R. philippinarum, sperm ultrastructure examined. Spermatozoa of R. variegata consist of (in anterior to posterior sequence): an elongate conical, deeply invaginated, acrosomal vesicle (length 1.58 ± 0.06 μm; width 0.99 ± 0.07 μm; invagination occupied by a granular subacrosomal material); a barrel-shaped nucleus (length 1.82 ± 0.06 μm; width 1.50 ± 0.03 μm); a midpiece consisting of two orthogonally arranged centrioles, surrounded by four spherical mitochondria; nine satellite fibers connecting the distal centriole to the plasma membrane; and a flagellum originating from the distal centriole. Contents of the acrosomal vesicle of R. variegata are differentiated into a very electron-dense basal ring and a less electron-dense zone (with seven dense transverse layers structure) on the anterior region of the acrosome. Spermatozoa of T. literatus differ from those of R. variegata and are characterized by a rounded-conical invaginated, acrosomal vesicle (length 0.88 ± 0.08 μm; width 0.77 ± 0.06 μm), with a basal ring; and an anteriorly-tapered, barrel-shaped nucleus (length 1.57 ± 0.04 μm; width 1.60 ± 0.09 μm); a midpiece composed of four mitochondria. Centriolar and flagellar details are essential as for R. variegata. Sperm morphology separating R. variegate, R. philippinarum, and T. literatus in different clades. The anterior region of the acrosomal vesicle in R. variegata sperm had the transverse bands structure whereas the apex of the acrosomal vesicle of T. literatus sperm had no such structure. This difference advocated that acrosomal feature could be an important character for taxonomic distinction. Our data supported the previous studies that the ultrastructure of bivalve sperm is species-specific. This advocates that the phyletic relationships of Tapetinae, commonly based on shell morphology, should also add additional and newer approaches.

Abstract: Summary
The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase physically interacts with the recombination proteins Rad51 and Rad52 from yeast to human cells. We show, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that these interactions occur within a nuclease-insoluble scaffold enriched in replication/repair factors. Rad51 accumulates in a MCM- and DNA-binding-independent manner and interacts with MCM helicases located outside of the replication origins and forks. MCM, Rad51, and Rad52 accumulate in this scaffold in G1 and are released during the S phase. In the presence of replication-blocking lesions, Cdc7 prevents their release from the scaffold, thus maintaining the interactions. We identify a rad51 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind to MCM but not to the scaffold. This mutant is proficient in recombination but partially defective in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap filling and replication fork progression through damaged DNA. Therefore, cells accumulate MCM/Rad51/Rad52 complexes at specific nuclear scaffolds in G1 to assist stressed forks through non-recombinogenic functions.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiac dysfunction observed in a patient with diabetes that may lead to heart failure. No specific treatment has yet been tested in DCM. Therefore, in this study, it was investigated that the potential of thymoquinone (TYM) and beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) to treat DCM. Five groups (n = 7) were formed, namely control, diabetes, TYM, BAIBA and TYM + BAIBA, with a random selection from 35 adult male rats. Diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/kg streptozotocin to all groups except the control. After establishing experimental diabetes, TYM (20 mg/kg/day) and BAIBA (100 mg/kg/day) were administered alone or in combination with other groups other than the control and diabetes groups for five weeks by gavage. Serum aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB, and tissue malondialdehyde levels increased significantly, and tissue glutathione levels decreased in the diabetes group compared to the control group. An increase in the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in the myocardium and the rate of fibrosis and apoptosis were found in the histopathological analysis. In the TYM and BAIBA groups, all pathological changes observed in the diabetes group improved significantly. The therapeutic effects of these agents on DCM are probably due to their antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. The present results suggested that TYM and BAIBA have the potential therapeutic effects on DCM that were used alone or combined.

Abstract: Cortisol is a ubiquitously expressed stress hormone. In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous cortisol on porcine gluteal muscles primary cultured satellite cells and fibroblasts. Satellite cells and fibroblasts were mono-or co-cultured, and cells in each type of culture were categorized into the control and cortisol-treated (treatment) groups. We selected 28 μmol mL−1 cortisol for treatment based on their efficacy. Cortisol treatment reduced viability of monocultured satellite cells and fibroblasts. In both monocultured and co-cultured cells, the nucleus in the treatment group was damaged than that control group. Moreover, the total cell cycle duration was shorter in the treatment group than the control group. PAX-7 expression was upregulated in the control group of co-cultured satellite cells and fibroblasts than those remaining groups. Moreover, MyoD expression was downregulated in the cortisol treated group of both mono-and co-cultured satellite cells compared with that in the control group. In co-cultured fibroblasts, MyoD and MyoG expression was upregulated than those remaining groups. The Cyto-C expression was upregulated in the treatment group compared to the control mono-and co-cultured both cells. These results suggest that the selected experimental dose of cortisol reduced cell viability and myogenesis-related gene expression in the monoculture compared to that in the co-culture of satellite cells and fibroblasts.

Abstract: This study investigated the abundance of pro-regenerative growth factors in bone marrow-derived platelet-rich plasma (BM-PRP) and their effects on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPC). Four 4–5 months-old domestic pigs were included, and each underwent bone marrow aspiration from its humerus bones and processed into bone marrow aspiration concentrate (BMAC) samples. The plasma and cellular portions of BMAC were subsequently separated and collected. The concentration of growth factors including BMP-2, PDGF-BB, TGF-β1 and VEGF in the plasma portion was measured and compared between BM-PRP and bone marrow-derived platelet-poor plasma (BM-PPP). It was found that platelet count was significantly higher in BM-PRP than in BM-PPP, but the concentration of above-mentioned growth factors was not significantly different between BM-PRP and BM-PPP. As most existing literature has indicated the regenerative potency of PRP, this study focused on assessing the effect of BM-PRP treatment on BM-MSC and BM-EPC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis capacity by comparing samples with 2.5% BM-PRP treatment and samples without BM-PRP treatment (control). In response to BM-PRP treatment, the cellular doubling time increased with culturing time and was significantly shorter in the BM-PRP-treated samples than in control samples. For osteogenic differentiation, BM-PRP-treated BM-MSCs demonstrated a time-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression levels of osteogenic differentiation markers. For the expression of angiogenic genes, none of the differences reached statistical significance despite a tendency of stronger expression at day 18 in BM-PRP-treated BM-EPCs. In conclusion, this in vitro study suggests that most BMP-2, PDGF-BB, TGF-β1 and VEGF-A contained in BM-PRP are not platelet-released and BM-PRP may have some stimulation (less than 1-fold) for MSC, EPC proliferation and MSC osteogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The underpinnings of cancer metastasis remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of tools for probing their emergence at high resolution. Here we present macsGESTALT, an inducible CRISPR-Cas9-based lineage recorder with highly efficient single-cell capture of both transcriptional and phylogenetic information. Applying macsGESTALT to a mouse model of metastatic pancreatic cancer, we recover ∼380,000 CRISPR target sites and reconstruct dissemination of ∼28,000 single cells across multiple metastatic sites. We find that cells occupy a continuum of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states. Metastatic potential peaks in rare, late-hybrid EMT states, which are aggressively selected from a predominately epithelial ancestral pool. The gene signatures of these late-hybrid EMT states are predictive of reduced survival in both human pancreatic and lung cancer patients, highlighting their relevance to clinical disease progression. Finally, we observe evidence for in vivo propagation of S100 family gene expression across clonally distinct metastatic subpopulations.

Abstract: Summary
The mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma is thought to be determined by both cancer cell-intrinsic alterations and extrinsic cellular interactions, but remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect glioblastoma-to-microenvironment interactions by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human tumors and model systems, combined with functional experiments. We demonstrate that macrophages induce a transition of glioblastoma cells into mesenchymal-like (MES-like) states. This effect is mediated, both in vitro and in vivo, by macrophage-derived oncostatin M (OSM) that interacts with its receptors (OSMR or LIFR) in complex with GP130 on glioblastoma cells and activates STAT3. We show that MES-like glioblastoma states are also associated with increased expression of a mesenchymal program in macrophages and with increased cytotoxicity of T cells, highlighting extensive alterations of the immune microenvironment with potential therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
Aging causes stem cell dysfunction as a result of extrinsic and intrinsic changes. Decreased function of the stem cell niche is an important contributor to this dysfunction. We use the Drosophila testis to investigate what factors maintain niche cells. The testis niche comprises quiescent “hub” cells and supports two mitotic stem cell pools: germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). We identify the cell-cycle-responsive Dp/E2f1 transcription factor as a crucial non-autonomous regulator required in CySCs to maintain hub cell quiescence. Dp/E2f1 inhibits local Activin ligands through production of the Activin antagonist Follistatin (Fs). Inactivation of Dp/E2f1 or Fs in CySCs or promoting Activin receptor signaling in hub cells causes transdifferentiation of hub cells into fully functional CySCs. This Activin-dependent communication between CySCs and hub regulates the physiological decay of the niche with age and demonstrates that hub cell quiescence results from signals from surrounding stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic lipid accumulation is a hallmark of type II diabetes (T2D) associated with hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hyperphagia. Hepatic synthesis of GABA, catalyzed by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), is upregulated in obese mice. To assess the role of hepatic GABA production in obesity-induced metabolic and energy dysregulation, we treated mice with two pharmacologic GABA-T inhibitors and knocked down hepatic GABA-T expression using an antisense oligonucleotide. Hepatic GABA-T inhibition and knockdown decreased basal hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and improved glucose intolerance. GABA-T knockdown improved insulin sensitivity assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in obese mice. Hepatic GABA-T knockdown also decreased food intake and induced weight loss without altering energy expenditure in obese mice. Data from people with obesity support the notion that hepatic GABA production and transport are associated with serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), T2D, and BMI. These results support a key role for hepatocyte GABA production in the dysfunctional glucoregulation and feeding behavior associated with obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Survival or apoptosis is a binary decision in individual cells. However, at the cell-population level, a graded increase in survival of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells is observed upon stimulation with erythropoietin (Epo). To identify components of Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK2/STAT5) signal transduction that contribute to the graded population response, we extended a cell-population-level model calibrated with experimental data to study the behavior in single cells. The single-cell model shows that the high cell-to-cell variability in nuclear phosphorylated STAT5 is caused by variability in the amount of Epo receptor (EpoR):JAK2 complexes and of SHP1, as well as the extent of nuclear import because of the large variance in the cytoplasmic volume of CFU-E cells. 24–118 pSTAT5 molecules in the nucleus for 120 min are sufficient to ensure cell survival. Thus, variability in membrane-associated processes is sufficient to convert a switch-like behavior at the single-cell level to a graded population-level response.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is a common feature of many human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the upstream regulators that promote AML metabolic reprogramming and the benefits conferred to leukemia cells by these metabolic changes remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription factor ATF3 coordinates serine and nucleotide metabolism to maintain cell cycling, survival, and the differentiation blockade in AML. Analysis of mouse and human AML models demonstrate that ATF3 directly activates the transcription of genes encoding key enzymatic regulators of serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Total steady-state polar metabolite and heavy isotope tracing analyses show that ATF3 inhibition reduces de novo serine synthesis, impedes the incorporation of serine-derived carbons into newly synthesized purines, and disrupts pyrimidine metabolism. Importantly, exogenous nucleotide supplementation mitigates the anti-leukemia effects of ATF3 inhibition. Together, these findings reveal the dependence of AML on ATF3-regulated serine and nucleotide metabolism.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among females. Over 90 % of the cases of death in BC patients are attributed to tumor cell metastasis. Therefore, it is urgently needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of BC metastasis. The expression of miRNA in BC was evaluated by qRT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis. Clone formation, EdU assays, and subcutaneous xenograft model were used to test the growth of BC cells. Wound healing, transwell assays, and lung-metastasis model were used to explore the effect of miR-934 knockdown on cell metastasis. The miR-934 targets in BC were identified through bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays. The expression of protein was tested by western blot. The binding of mRNA and RNA-binding-protein was verified using RIP assays. miR-934 expression was significantly elevated in BC tissues, especially in those with lymph node metastasis and associated with poor patient prognosis. Experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that that upregulated miR-934 was not necessarily required for the growth of BC cells. However, miR-934 knockdown significantly inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of BC cells. Moreover, PTEN as identified as the direct target of miR-934 in BC, and miR-934 could promote BC cell metastasis by regulation of PTEN and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our results suggested that targeting miR-934 may be a practical treatment for BC cell metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise is a powerful driver of physiological angiogenesis during adulthood, but the mechanisms of exercise-induced vascular expansion are poorly understood. We explored endothelial heterogeneity in skeletal muscle and identified two capillary muscle endothelial cell (mEC) populations that are characterized by differential expression of ATF3/4. Spatial mapping showed that ATF3/4+ mECs are enriched in red oxidative muscle areas while ATF3/4low ECs lie adjacent to white glycolytic fibers. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that red ATF3/4+ mECs are more angiogenic when compared with white ATF3/4low mECs. Mechanistically, ATF3/4 in mECs control genes involved in amino acid uptake and metabolism and metabolically prime red (ATF3/4+) mECs for angiogenesis. As a consequence, supplementation of non-essential amino acids and overexpression of ATF4 increased proliferation of white mECs. Finally, deleting Atf4 in ECs impaired exercise-induced angiogenesis. Our findings illustrate that spatial metabolic angiodiversity determines the angiogenic potential of muscle ECs.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) is synthetic lethal with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Lethality is thought to derive from DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) necessitating BRCA function in homologous recombination (HR) and/or fork protection (FP). Here, we report instead that toxicity derives from replication gaps. BRCA1- or FANCJ-deficient cells, with common repair defects but distinct PARPi responses, reveal gaps as a distinguishing factor. We further uncouple HR, FP, and fork speed from PARPi response. Instead, gaps characterize BRCA-deficient cells, are diminished upon resistance, restored upon resensitization, and, when exposed, augment PARPi toxicity. Unchallenged BRCA1-deficient cells have elevated poly(ADP-ribose) and chromatin-associated PARP1, but aberrantly low XRCC1 consistent with defects in backup Okazaki fragment processing (OFP). 53BP1 loss resuscitates OFP by restoring XRCC1-LIG3 that suppresses the sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient cells to drugs targeting OFP or generating gaps. We highlight gaps as a determinant of PARPi toxicity changing the paradigm for synthetic lethal interactions.

Abstract: Summary
The gut metabolite composition determined by the microbiota has paramount impact on gastrointestinal physiology. However, the role that bacterial metabolites play in communicating with host cells during inflammatory diseases is poorly understood. Here, we aim to identify the microbiota-determined output of the pro-inflammatory metabolite, succinate, and to elucidate the pathways that control transepithelial succinate absorption and subsequent succinate delivery to macrophages. We show a significant increase of succinate uptake into pro-inflammatory macrophages, which is controlled by Na+-dependent succinate transporters in macrophages and epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that fecal and serum succinate concentrations were markedly augmented in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and corresponded to changes in succinate-metabolizing gut bacteria. Together, our results describe a succinate production and transport pathway that controls the absorption of succinate generated by distinct gut bacteria and its delivery into macrophages. In IBD, this mechanism fails to protect against the succinate surge, which may result in chronic inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Upon nutrient stimulation, pre-adipocytes undergo differentiation to transform into mature adipocytes capable of storing nutrients as fat. We profiled cellular metabolite consumption to identify early metabolic drivers of adipocyte differentiation. We find that adipocyte differentiation raises the uptake and consumption of numerous amino acids. In particular, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism precedes and promotes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator of adipogenesis. In early adipogenesis, the mitochondrial sirtuin SIRT4 elevates BCAA catabolism through the activation of methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (MCCC). MCCC supports leucine oxidation by catalyzing the carboxylation of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) expression is decreased in adipose tissue of numerous diabetic mouse models, and its expression is most correlated with BCAA enzymes, suggesting a potential role for SIRT4 in adipose pathology through the alteration of BCAA metabolism. In summary, this work provides a temporal analysis of adipocyte differentiation and uncovers early metabolic events that stimulate transcriptional reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The HCN1–4 channel family is responsible for the hyperpolarization-activated cation current If/Ih that controls automaticity in cardiac and neuronal pacemaker cells. We present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of HCN4 in the presence or absence of bound cAMP, displaying the pore domain in closed and open conformations. Analysis of cAMP-bound and -unbound structures sheds light on how ligand-induced transitions in the channel cytosolic portion mediate the effect of cAMP on channel gating and highlights the regulatory role of a Mg2+ coordination site formed between the C-linker and the S4-S5 linker. Comparison of open/closed pore states shows that the cytosolic gate opens through concerted movements of the S5 and S6 transmembrane helices. Furthermore, in combination with molecular dynamics analyses, the open pore structures provide insights into the mechanisms of K+/Na+ permeation. Our results contribute mechanistic understanding on HCN channel gating, cyclic nucleotide-dependent modulation, and ion permeation.

Abstract: The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate gates post-synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) to mediate extracellular Ca2+ entry and stimulate neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase to release NO and trigger neurovascular coupling (NVC). Neuronal and glial NMDARs may also operate in a flux-independent manner, although it is unclear whether their non-ionotropic mode of action is involved in NVC. Recently, endothelial NMDARs were found to trigger Ca2+-dependent NO production and induce NVC, but the underlying mode of signaling remains elusive. Herein, we report that GluN1 protein, as well as GluN2C and GluN3B transcripts and proteins, were expressed and that NMDA did not elicit inward currents, but induced a dose-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the human brain microvascular endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. A multidisciplinary approach, including live cell imaging, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, pharmacological manipulation and gene targeting, revealed that NMDARs increase the [Ca2+]i in a flux-independent manner in hCMEC/D3 cells. The Ca2+ response to NMDA was triggered by endogenous Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the lysosomal Ca2+ stores and sustained by store-operated Ca2+ entry. Unexpectedly, pharmacological and genetic blockade of mGluR1 and mGluR5 dramatically impaired NMDARs-mediated Ca2+ signals. These findings indicate that NMDARs may increase the endothelial [Ca2+]i in a flux-independent manner via group 1 mGluRs. However, imaging of DAF-FM fluorescence revealed that NMDARs may also induce Ca2+-dependent NO release by signaling in a flux-dependent manner. These findings, therefore, shed novel light on the mechanisms whereby brain microvascular endothelium decodes glutamatergic signaling and regulates NVC.

Abstract: GPR43 (also known as FFAR2 or FFA2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in immune cells, enteroendocrine cells and adipocytes that recognizes short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, likely to be implicated in innate immunity and host energy homeostasis. Activated GPR43 suppresses the cAMP level and induces Ca2+ flux via coupling to Gαi and Gαq families, respectively. Additionally, GPR43 is reported to facilitate phosphorylation of ERK through G-protein-dependent pathways and interacts with β-arrestin 2 to inhibit NF-κB signaling. However, other G-protein-dependent and independent signaling pathways involving GPR43 remain to be established. Here, we have demonstrated that GPR43 augments Rho GTPase signaling. Acetate and a synthetic agonist effectively activated RhoA and stabilized YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators through interactions of GPR43 with Gαq/11 and Gα12/13. Acetate-induced nuclear accumulation of YAP was blocked by a GPR43-specific inverse agonist. The target genes induced by YAP/TAZ were further regulated by GPR43. Moreover, in THP-1–derived M1-like macrophage cells, the Rho-YAP/TAZ pathway was activated by acetate and a synthetic agonist. Our collective findings suggest that GPR43 acts as a mediator of the Rho-YAP/TAZ pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The cell nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane. The lipid packing and viscosity of membranes is critical for their function and is tightly controlled by lipid saturation. Circuits regulating the lipid saturation of the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) and contiguous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are known. However, how lipid saturation is controlled in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) has remained enigmatic. Using INM biosensors and targeted genetic manipulations, we show that increased lipid unsaturation causes a reprogramming of lipid storage metabolism across the nuclear envelope (NE). Cells induce lipid droplet (LD) formation specifically from the distant ONM/ER, whereas LD formation at the INM is suppressed. In doing so, unsaturated fatty acids are shifted away from the INM. We identify the transcription circuits that topologically reprogram LD synthesis and identify seipin and phosphatidic acid as critical effectors. Our study suggests a detoxification mechanism protecting the INM from excess lipid unsaturation.

Abstract: Calcium homeostasis is essential for neuronal cell survival/differentiation. Imbalance of the Ca2+ homeostasis due to excessive Ca2+ overload is essential for spinal cord injury (SCI). The overload resulted from Ca2+ flux across the plasma membrane and from internal Ca2+ store release (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ER). Inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) are involved in releasing Ca2+ from ER contributing to axonal degeneration following SCI. In turn, block of both receptors is axoprotective. The calstabin RyR subunit, stabilizing the channel in a state of reduced activity, prevents pathological Ca2+ release too. We investigated whether S107, a RyR-stabilizing compound (Rycal), is beneficial for survival and neuritogenesis of spinal cord motor neurons in vitro. We used a spinal cord slice model and the motor neuron-like NSC-34 cell line. Effects of S107 were tested by propidium iodide/fluorescein diacetate vital staining, mitotic index determination via BrdU-incorporation, and neurite sprouting parameters. Results showed that S107 (i) had no effect on gliosis resulting from slices preparation; (ii) had no effect on motor neuronal survival and proliferation; and (iii) impaired neurite sprouting, no matter whether it was a differentiation (NSC-34 cells) or regeneration (spinal cord slices) process. The results underline the need for a flexible Ca2+homeostasis provided by the ER for re-initiation of neuritogenesis.

CRISPR-inspired systems have been extensively developed for applications in genome editing and nucleic acid detection. Here, we introduce a CRISPR-based peptide display technology to facilitate customized, high-throughput in vitro protein interaction studies. We show that bespoke peptide libraries fused to catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and barcoded with unique single guide RNA (sgRNA) molecules self-assemble from a single mixed pool to programmable positions on a DNA microarray surface for rapid, multiplexed binding assays. We develop dCas9-displayed saturation mutagenesis libraries to characterize antibody-epitope binding for a commercial anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and human serum antibodies. We also show that our platform can be used for viral epitope mapping and exhibits promise as a multiplexed diagnostics tool. Our CRISPR-based peptide display platform and the principles of complex library self-assembly using dCas9 could be adapted for rapid interrogation of varied customized protein libraries or biological materials assembly using DNA scaffolding.

Abstract: The lining mucosa of the nasal cavity performs important roles for the host adaptation to the external environment. Camels are unique in their adaptation to the lifestyle of nomadic deserts. The present study aimed to evaluate the distribution pattern of T lymphocytes and S-phase proliferating cells within the nasal mucosa of camel using antibodies against CD3 and PCNA, respectively. The mucosa of the rostral, middle, and caudal parts of the nasal cavity was collected and processed for immunohistochemical staining. CD3-immunoreactive (-IR) cells were observed within the epithelium and lamina propria of all examined parts. However, the numbers of these cells were significantly higher in the rostral part of the nasal mucosa compared to its middle and caudal parts (P < 0.05). Such expression of CD3-IR cells within the rostral nasal mucosa was most pronounced within its lamina propria which also revealed aggregations of lymphoid cells. The increased frequency of CD3 expressing cells at the rostral part of the nasal mucosa suggests a potential role of the nasal vestibule in limiting the infection via constant clearance of encountered pathogens. PCNA-IR cells were mainly found within the basal layers of the nasal epithelium at the rostral part of the nasal cavity, though they showed a significant decrease in their frequencies on moving caudad. The results of the present work will form a basis for assessment of various nasal pathologies affecting camels particularly those associated with increased rates of T lymphocytes infiltration and/or cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Active brown adipose tissue (BAT) consumes copious amounts of glucose, yet how glucose metabolism supports thermogenesis is unclear. By combining transcriptomics, metabolomics, and stable isotope tracing in vivo, we systematically analyze BAT glucose utilization in mice during acute and chronic cold exposure. Metabolite profiling reveals extensive temperature-dependent changes in the BAT metabolome and transcriptome upon cold adaptation, discovering unexpected metabolite markers of thermogenesis, including increased N-acetyl-amino acid production. Time-course stable isotope tracing further reveals rapid incorporation of glucose carbons into glycolysis and TCA cycle, as well as several auxiliary pathways, including NADPH, nucleotide, and phospholipid synthesis pathways. Gene expression differences inconsistently predict glucose fluxes, indicating that posttranscriptional mechanisms also govern glucose utilization. Surprisingly, BAT swiftly generates fatty acids and acyl-carnitines from glucose, suggesting that lipids are rapidly synthesized and immediately oxidized. These data reveal versatility in BAT glucose utilization, highlighting the value of an integrative-omics approach to understanding organ metabolism.

Abstract: The involvement of endometrial IGF-1R/IGF-1/Bcl-2 pathways and the potential regulatory effects of exogenously administrated melatonin on this expression is investigated in the experimental PCOS model in the present study. Thirty-two 6–8 week old Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the Sham Control Group (1% CMC/day by oral gavage [o.g.]); the Melatonin Group (2 mg/kg/day melatonin by subcutaneous administration [s.c.]); the Experimental PCOS Group (1 mg/kg/day Letrozole by o.g.); and the Experimental PCOS + Melatonin Group (1 mg/kg/day Letrozole by o.g. and 2 mg/kg/day melatonin by s.c. administration). Vaginal smear samples were taken from the 14th day to the end of the experiment for colpocytological measurements. At the end of the 21 day experimental period, uterine tissues were taken; Hematoxylin-Eosin histochemical, IGF-1R/IGF-1/Bcl-2, PCNA immuno-histochemical stainings and western blot analyses were performed for related antibodies. All of the data was supported statistically. The epithelium of endometrium lost its single-layer structure in some parts, separation was observed between the epithelium and the basal membrane junction, intracellular edema was found in the uterine glands by the polycystic ovary-induction. Also this induction increased the expression of IGF-1R/IGF-1, Bcl-2, and PCNA proteins. Morphological degenerations returned to its normal appearance generally by the melatonin administrations and melatonin also regulated the increased expression of endometrial IGF-1R/IGF-1/Bcl-2 and PCNA pathways. It is concluded that additional studies are needed, using melatonin as a supporting agent may be appropriate in cases of PCOS.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear chromosomes transcribe far more RNA than required to encode protein. Here we investigate whether non-coding RNA broadly contributes to cytological-scale chromosome territory architecture. We develop a procedure that depletes soluble proteins, chromatin, and most nuclear RNA from the nucleus but does not delocalize XIST, a known architectural RNA, from an insoluble chromosome “scaffold.” RNA-seq analysis reveals that most RNA in the nuclear scaffold is repeat-rich, non-coding, and derived predominantly from introns of nascent transcripts. Insoluble, repeat-rich (C0T-1) RNA co-distributes with known scaffold proteins including scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), and distribution of these components inversely correlates with chromatin compaction in normal and experimentally manipulated nuclei. We further show that RNA is required for SAF-A to interact with chromatin and for enrichment of structurally embedded “scaffold attachment regions” prevalent in euchromatin. Collectively, the results indicate that long nascent transcripts contribute a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories.

Abstract: Summary
The β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR) is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and urinary bladder and has emerged as an attractive drug target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and overactive bladder (OAB). Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the β3AR-Gs signaling complex with the selective agonist mirabegron, a first-in-class drug for OAB. Comparison of this structure with the previously reported β1AR and β2AR structures reveals a receptor activation mechanism upon mirabegron binding to the orthosteric site. Notably, the narrower exosite in β3AR creates a perpendicular pocket for mirabegron. Mutational analyses suggest that a combination of both the exosite shape and the amino-acid-residue substitutions defines the drug selectivity of the βAR agonists. Our findings provide a molecular basis for βAR subtype selectivity, allowing the design of more-selective agents with fewer adverse effects.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate control of innate immune responses is required to eliminate invading pathogens and simultaneously avoid autoinflammation and autoimmune diseases. Here, we demonstrate that arginine monomethylation precisely regulates the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated antiviral response. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) forms aggregates to catalyze MAVS monomethylation at arginine residue 52 (R52), attenuating its binding to TRIM31 and RIG-I, which leads to the suppression of MAVS aggregation and subsequent activation. Upon virus infection, aggregated PRMT7 is disabled in a timely manner due to automethylation at arginine residue 32 (R32), and SMURF1 is recruited to PRMT7 by MAVS to induce proteasomal degradation of PRMT7, resulting in the relief of PRMT7 suppression of MAVS activation. Therefore, we not only reveal that arginine monomethylation by PRMT7 negatively regulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling in vitro and in vivo but also uncover a mechanism by which PRMT7 is tightly controlled to ensure the timely activation of antiviral defense.

Abstract: Ubiquitin D (UBD) is highly upregulated in many cancers, and plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiological processes of cancers. However, its roles and underlying mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of UBD in patients with OSCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to measure the expression of UBD in OSCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to detect the differential expressions of UBD in 244 OSCC patients and 32 cases of normal oral mucosae. In addition, CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effect of UBD on the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in OSCC. Furthermore, a xenograft tumor model was established to verify the role of UBD on tumor formation in vivo. We found that UBD was upregulated in human OSCC tissues and cell lines and was associated with clinical and pathological features of patients. Moreover, the overexpression of UBD promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells; however, the knockdown of UBD exerted the opposite effects. In this study, our results also suggested that UBD promoted OSCC progression through NF-κB signaling. Our findings indicated that UBD played a critical role in OSCC and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for OSCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The sustained proliferation of microglia is a key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), accelerating its progression. Here, we aim to understand the long-term impact of the early and prolonged microglial proliferation observed in AD, hypothesizing that extensive and repeated cycling would engender a distinct transcriptional and phenotypic trajectory. We show that the early and sustained microglial proliferation seen in an AD-like model promotes replicative senescence, characterized by increased βgal activity, a senescence-associated transcriptional signature, and telomere shortening, correlating with the appearance of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and senescent microglial profiles in human post-mortem AD cases. The prevention of early microglial proliferation hinders the development of senescence and DAM, impairing the accumulation of Aβ, as well as associated neuritic and synaptic damage. Overall, our results indicate that excessive microglial proliferation leads to the generation of senescent DAM, which contributes to early Aβ pathology in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Efforts to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy have focused on vaccination strategies using neoepitopes, although they cannot be applied on a large scale due to the “private” nature of cancer mutations. Here, we show that infection of tumor cells with Salmonella induces the opening of membrane hemichannels and the extracellular release of proteasome-generated peptides by the exacerbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Peptides released by cancer cells foster an antitumor response in vivo, both in mice bearing B16F10 melanomas and in dogs suffering from osteosarcoma. Mass spectrometry analysis on the supernatant of human melanoma cells revealed 12 peptides capable of priming healthy-donor CD8+ T cells that recognize and kill human melanoma cells in vitro and when xenotransplanted in vivo. Hence, we identified a class of shared tumor antigens that are generated in ER-stressed cells, such as tumor cells, that do not induce tolerance and are not presented by healthy cells.

Abstract: Summary
While the immediate and transitory response of breast cancer cells to pathological stiffness in their native microenvironment has been well explored, it remains unclear how stiffness-induced phenotypes are maintained over time after cancer cell dissemination in vivo. Here, we show that fibrotic-like matrix stiffness promotes distinct metastatic phenotypes in cancer cells, which are preserved after transition to softer microenvironments, such as bone marrow. Using differential gene expression analysis of stiffness-responsive breast cancer cells, we establish a multigenic score of mechanical conditioning (MeCo) and find that it is associated with bone metastasis in patients with breast cancer. The maintenance of mechanical conditioning is regulated by RUNX2, an osteogenic transcription factor, established driver of bone metastasis, and mitotic bookmarker that preserves chromatin accessibility at target gene loci. Using genetic and functional approaches, we demonstrate that mechanical conditioning maintenance can be simulated, repressed, or extended, with corresponding changes in bone metastatic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic regulation strategies have been developed to redirect metabolic fluxes to production pathways. However, it is difficult to screen out target genes that, when repressed, improve yield without affecting cell growth. Here, we report a strategy using a quorum-sensing system to control small RNA transcription, allowing cell-density-dependent repression of target genes. This strategy is shown with convenient operation, dynamic repression, and availability for simultaneous regulation of multiple genes. The parameters Ai, Am, and RA (3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone [AHL] concentrations at which half of the maximum repression and the maximum repression were reached and value of the maximum repression when AHL was added manually, respectively) are defined and introduced to characterize repression curves, and the variant LuxRI58N is identified as the most suitable tuning factor for shake flask culture. Moreover, it is shown that dynamic overexpression of the Hfq chaperone is the key to combinatorial repression without disruptions on cell growth. To show a broad applicability, the production titers of pinene, pentalenene, and psilocybin are improved by 365.3%, 79.5%, and 302.9%, respectively, by applying combinatorial dynamic repression.

Abstract: Summary
Skilled movements rely on a coordinated cortical and subcortical network, but how this network supports motor recovery after stroke is unknown. Previous studies focused on the perilesional cortex (PLC), but precisely how connected subcortical areas reorganize and coordinate with PLC is unclear. The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is of interest because it receives monosynaptic inputs from motor cortex and is important for learning and generation of fast reliable actions. Using a rat focal stroke model, we perform chronic electrophysiological recordings in motor PLC and DLS during long-term recovery of a dexterous skill. We find that recovery is associated with the simultaneous emergence of reliable movement-related single-trial ensemble spiking in both structures along with increased cross-area alignment of spiking. Our study highlights the importance of consistent neural activity patterns across brain structures during recovery and suggests that modulation of cross-area coordination can be a therapeutic target for enhancing motor function post-stroke.

Abstract: T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a high-risk malignancy. The effects of cancer growth-related Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 665 (LINC00665) in T-ALL remained obscure, and therefore further exploration was conducted on that in this study. The expression of LINC00665 in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) tissues and myeloid tissues was analyzed using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) 2. The target microRNA (miR) of LINC00665 was predicted by LncBase Predicted v.2 and verified using dual-luciferase reporter assay. After LINC00665 and miR-101 in T-ALL cells were overexpressed or silenced, the viability, migration and invasion of cell were detected using cell counting kit-8 and Transwell assays. The expressions of LINC00665, miR-101, Cyclin D1, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9, phosphorylated (p)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), PI3K, p-Akt, Akt were detected by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. High expression of LINC00665 was presented in LAML tissues, the peripheral blood samples from patients with T-ALL and T-ALL cells. Overexpression of LINC00665 promoted the viability, migration and invasion of T-ALL cells and downregulated miR-101 expression, whereas silencing of LINC00665 did oppositely. MiR-101 could competitively bind to LINC00665, and was low-expressed in T-ALL. MiR-101 mimic inhibited viability, migration and invasion of T-ALL cells, and reversed effects of overexpressed LINC00665, whilst miR-101 inhibitor reversed the effects of LINC00665 silencing. Besides, overexpressed LINC00665 upregulated the expressions of Cyclin D1 MMP-2, and MMP-9 and the ratios of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-Akt/Akt, which were reversed by miR-101 mimic. LINC00665 could enhance the viability, migration and invasion abilities of T-ALL cells by targeting miR-101 via activating PI3K/Akt pathway.

Abstract: Background
Osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells is essential to periodontal regeneration treatment for periodontitis. This study investigated the mechanism of lncRNAs-related osteogenic differentiation.
Methods
Human periodontal ligament stem cells were extracted from human periodontal ligament and identified via flow cytometry. After being induced into osteogenic differentiation for three weeks using osteoblast inducing conditional media, human periodontal ligament stem cells were transfected with siRNA-MALAT1, or miR-155-5p inhibitor. Human periodontal ligament stem cells osteogenesis was observed by alkaline phosphatase staining, followed by alizarin red staining for evaluating mineralized nodes formation. Runt-related gene 2, collagen-1 and osteocalcin expressions were assessed by western blot and qRT-PCR.
Results
MALAT1 expression was assumed a negative correlation with miR-155-5p expression which was dropping over time in differentiating human periodontal ligament stem cells. MALAT1 could bind with miR-155-5p, and E26 transformation specific-1 (ETS1) was the targeted gene of miR-155-5p. Silenced MALAT1 suppressed ALP activity and mineralized nodes formation and inhibited the expressions of runt-related gene 2, collagen-1 and osteocalcin in differentiating human periodontal ligament stem cells, while miR-155-5p inhibitor reversed the effect of si-MALAT1 on differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells.
Conclusion
MALAT1 modulated differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells via regulating miR-155-5p.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is propagated by leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are not eradicated by tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment and persist as a source of disease recurrence. Bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal niches play an essential role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and LSC maintenance. Using a murine CML model, we examine leukemia-induced alterations in mesenchymal cell populations. We show that 6C3+ stromal progenitors expand in CML BM and exhibit increased LSC but reduced HSC supportive capacity. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling mediates expansion and higher expression of CXCL1 in CML BM 6C3+ cells and higher expression of the CXCL1 receptor CXCR2 in LSCs. CXCL1 enhances LSC proliferation and self-renewal, whereas CXCR2 inhibition reduces LSC growth and enhances LSC targeting in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We find that TNF-α-mediated alterations in CML BM stromal niches enhance support of LSC maintenance and growth via CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling and that CXCR2 inhibition effectively depletes CML LSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Contact inhibition of cell proliferation regulates tissue size and prevents uncontrolled cell expansion. When cell density increases, contact inhibition can force proliferating cells into quiescence. Here we show that the variable memory of local cell density experienced by a mother cell controls the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activator cyclin D1 and inhibitor p27 in newborn daughters, which direct cells to proliferation or quiescence. Much of this regulation can be explained by rapid suppression of ERK activity by high cell density in mothers, which leads to lower cyclin D1 and higher p27 levels in daughters. Strikingly, cell density and mitogen signals compete by shifting the ratio of cyclin D1/p27 levels below or above a single sharp threshold that controls the proliferation decision. Thus, the history of competing cell density and mitogen signals experienced by mothers is funneled into a precise activator-inhibitor balance that decides the fate of daughter cells.

Abstract: Summary
The Hsp90 chaperone promotes folding and activation of hundreds of client proteins in the cell through an ATP-dependent conformational cycle guided by distinct cochaperone regulators. The FKBP51 immunophilin binds Hsp90 with its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and catalyzes peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity during folding of kinases, nuclear receptors, and tau. Here we determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human Hsp90:FKBP51:p23 complex to 3.3 Å, which, together with mutagenesis and crosslinking analyses, reveals the basis for cochaperone binding to Hsp90 during client maturation. A helix extension in the TPR functions as a key recognition element, interacting across the Hsp90 C-terminal dimer interface presented in the closed, ATP conformation. The PPIase domain is positioned along the middle domain, adjacent to Hsp90 client binding sites, whereas a single p23 makes stabilizing interactions with the N-terminal dimer. With this architecture, FKBP51 is positioned to act on specific client residues presented during Hsp90-catalyzed remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Stalled DNA replication fork restart after stress as orchestrated by ATR kinase, BLM helicase, and structure-specific nucleases enables replication, cell survival, and genome stability. Here we unveil human exonuclease V (EXO5) as an ATR-regulated DNA structure-specific nuclease and BLM partner for replication fork restart. We find that elevated EXO5 in tumors correlates with increased mutation loads and poor patient survival, suggesting that EXO5 upregulation has oncogenic potential. Structural, mechanistic, and mutational analyses of EXO5 and EXO5-DNA complexes reveal a single-stranded DNA binding channel with an adjacent ATR phosphorylation motif (T88Q89) that regulates EXO5 nuclease activity and BLM binding identified by mass spectrometric analysis. EXO5 phospho-mimetic mutant rescues the restart defect from EXO5 depletion that decreases fork progression, DNA damage repair, and cell survival. EXO5 depletion furthermore rescues survival of FANCA-deficient cells and indicates EXO5 functions epistatically with SMARCAL1 and BLM. Thus, an EXO5 axis connects ATR and BLM in directing replication fork restart.

Abstract: Summary
SPT6 is a histone chaperone that tightly binds RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during transcription elongation. However, its primary role in transcription is uncertain. We used targeted protein degradation to rapidly deplete SPT6 in human cells and analyzed defects in RNAPII behavior by a multi-omics approach and mathematical modeling. Our data indicate that SPT6 is a crucial factor for RNAPII processivity and is therefore required for the productive transcription of protein-coding genes. Unexpectedly, SPT6 also has a vital role in RNAPII termination, as acute depletion induced readthrough transcription for thousands of genes. Long-term depletion of SPT6 induced cryptic intragenic transcription, as observed earlier in yeast. However, this phenotype was not observed upon acute SPT6 depletion and therefore can be attributed to accumulated epigenetic perturbations in the prolonged absence of SPT6. In conclusion, targeted degradation of SPT6 allowed the temporal discrimination of its function as an epigenetic safeguard and RNAPII elongation factor.

Abstract: Summary
Delivering a keynote talk at a conference organized by a scientific society or being named as a fellow by such a society indicates that a scientist is held in high regard by their colleagues. To explore if the distribution of such indicators of esteem in the field of bioinformatics reflects the composition of this field, we compared the gender, name origin, and country of affiliation of 412 honorees from the “International Society for Computational Biology” (75 fellows and 337 keynote speakers) with over 170,000 last authorships on computational biology papers between 1993 and 2019. The proportion of honors bestowed on women was similar to that of the field’s overall last authorship rate. However, names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among honorees. Moreover, there were roughly twice as many honors bestowed on scientists with an affiliation in the United States as expected based on literature authorship. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are critical metabolic and signaling hubs, and dysregulated mitochondrial homeostasis is implicated in many diseases. Degradation of damaged mitochondria by selective GABARAP/LC3-dependent macro-autophagy (mitophagy) is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. To identify alternate forms of mitochondrial quality control that functionally compensate if mitophagy is inactive, we selected for autophagy-dependent cancer cells that survived loss of LC3-dependent autophagosome formation caused by inactivation of ATG7 or RB1CC1/FIP200. We discovered rare surviving autophagy-deficient clones that adapted to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis after gene inactivation and identified two enhanced mechanisms affecting mitochondria including mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). To further understand these mechanisms, we quantified MDVs via flow cytometry and confirmed an SNX9-mediated mechanism necessary for flux of MDVs to lysosomes. We show that the autophagy-dependent cells acquire unique dependencies on these processes, indicating that these alternate forms of mitochondrial homeostasis compensate for loss of autophagy to maintain mitochondrial health.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunction of the endolysosomal-autophagy network is emerging as an important pathogenic process in Alzheimer’s disease. Mutations in the sorting receptor-encoding gene SORL1 cause autosomal-dominant Alzheimer’s disease, and SORL1 variants increase risk for late-onset AD. To understand the contribution of SORL1 mutations to AD pathogenesis, we analyze the effects of a SORL1 truncating mutation on SORL1 protein levels and endolysosome function in human neurons. We find that truncating mutation results in SORL1 haploinsufficiency and enlarged endosomes in human neurons. Analysis of isogenic SORL1 wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous null neurons demonstrates that, whereas SORL1 haploinsufficiency results in endosome dysfunction, complete loss of SORL1 leads to additional defects in lysosome function and autophagy. Neuronal endolysosomal dysfunction caused by loss of SORL1 is relieved by extracellular antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of APP protein, demonstrating that PSEN1, APP, and SORL1 act in a common pathway regulating the endolysosome system, which becomes dysfunctional in AD.

Abstract: Summary
The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway monitors the cellular cholesterol level through sterol-regulated association between the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (Scap) and the insulin-induced gene (Insig). Despite structural determination of the Scap and Insig-2 complex bound to 25-hydroxycholesterol, the luminal domains of Scap remain unresolved. In this study, combining cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis and artificial intelligence-facilitated structural prediction, we report the structure of the human Scap/Insig-2 complex purified in digitonin. The luminal domain loop 1 and a co-folded segment in loop 7 of Scap resemble those of the luminal/extracellular domain in NPC1 and related proteins, providing clues to the cholesterol-regulated interaction of loop 1 and loop 7. An additional luminal interface is observed between Scap and Insig. We also show that Scap(D428A), which inhibits SREBP activation even under sterol depletion, exhibits an identical conformation with the wild-type protein when complexed with Insig-2, and its constitutive suppression of the SREBP pathway may also involve a later step in protein trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
γδ T cells form an integral arm of the immune system and are critical during protective and destructive immunity. However, how γδ T cells are functionally programmed in vivo remains unclear. Here, we employ RBPJ-inducible and KN6-transgenic mice to assess the roles of ontogenic timing, T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength, and Notch signaling. We find skewing of Vγ1+ cells toward the PLZF+Lin28b+ lineage at the fetal stage. Generation of interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing γδ T cells is favored during, although not exclusive to, the fetal stage. Surprisingly, Notch signaling is dispensable for peripheral γδ T cell IL-17 production. Strong TCR signals, together with Notch, promote IL-4 differentiation. Conversely, less strong TCR signals promote Notch-independent IL-17 differentiation. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals differential programming instilled by TCR signal strength and Notch for specific subsets. Thus, our results precisely define the roles of ontogenic timing, TCR signal strength, and Notch signaling in γδ T cell functional programming in vivo.

Abstract: The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2) channel is highly selective for Ca2+ and can be activated by lipids, such as LysoPhosphatidylCholine (LPC). LPC analogues, such as the synthetic alkyl-ether-lipid edelfosine or the endogenous alkyl-ether-lipid Platelet Activating Factor (PAF), modulates ion channels in cancer cells. This opens the way to develop alkyl-ether-lipids for the modulation of TRPV2 in cancer. Here, we investigated the role of 2-Acetamido-2-Deoxy-l-O-Hexadecyl-rac-Glycero-3-PhosphatidylCholine (AD-HGPC), a new alkyl-ether-lipid (LPC analogue), on TRPV2 trafficking and its impact on Ca2+ -dependent cell migration. The effect of AD-HGPC on the TRPV2 channel and tumour process was further investigated using calcium imaging and an in vivo mouse model. Using molecular and pharmacological approaches, we dissected the mechanism implicated in alkyl-ether-lipids sensitive TRPV2 trafficking. We found that TRPV2 promotes constitutive Ca2+ entry, leading to migration of highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines through the PI3K/Akt-Girdin axis. AD-HGPC addresses the functional TRPV2 channel in the plasma membrane through Golgi stimulation and PI3K/Akt/Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to constitutive Ca2+ entry and breast cancer cell migration (without affecting the development of metastasis), in a mouse model. We describe, for the first time, the biological role of a new alkyl-ether-lipid on TRPV2 channel trafficking in breast cancer cells and highlight the potential modulation of TRPV2 by alkyl-ether-lipids as a novel avenue for research in the treatment of metastatic cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons have the capacity to adapt to environmental stimuli, a phenomenon termed cellular plasticity. The underlying processes are controlled by a network of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Their precise impact, however, is largely unknown. To address this important question, we chose Pumilio2 (Pum2) and Staufen2 (Stau2), which both regulate synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, even though both RBPs dynamically interact with each other in neurons, their respective impact on the transcriptome and proteome is highly selective. Although Pum2 deficiency leads to reduced translation and protein expression, Stau2 depletion preferentially impacts RNA levels and increases protein abundance. Furthermore, we show that Pum2 activates expression of key GABAergic synaptic components, e.g., the GABAA receptor scaffold protein Gephyrin. Consequently, Pum2 depletion selectively reduced the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, our data argue for an important role of RBPs to maintain proteostasis in order to control distinct aspects of synaptic transmission.

Abstract: Summary
The low level of transcytosis is a unique feature of cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs), ensuring restrictive blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (MFSD2A) is a key regulator of the BBB function by suppressing caveolae-mediated transcytosis. However, the mechanisms regulating MFSD2A at the BBB have been barely explored. Here, we show that cerebrovascular EC-specific deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) results in a dramatic increase in vesicular transcytosis by the reduction of MFSD2A, leading to increased transcellular permeability of the BBB. Mechanistically, AKT signaling inhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2-mediated MFSD2A degradation. Consistently, cerebrovascular Nedd4-2 overexpression decreases MFSD2A levels, increases transcytosis, and impairs BBB permeability, recapitulating the phenotypes of Pten-deficient mice. Furthermore, Akt deletion decreases phosphorylated NEDD4-2 levels, restores MFSD2A levels, and normalizes BBB permeability in Pten-mutant mice. Altogether, our work reveals the essential physiological function of the PTEN/AKT/NEDD4-2/MFSD2A axis in the regulation of BBB permeability.

Abstract: Summary
N-degron pathways are a set of proteolytic systems that target the N-terminal destabilizing residues of substrates for proteasomal degradation. Recently, the Gly/N-degron pathway has been identified as a new branch of the N-degron pathway. The N-terminal glycine degron (Gly/N-degron) is recognized by ZYG11B and ZER1, the substrate receptors of the Cullin 2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL2). Here we present the crystal structures of ZYG11B and ZER1 bound to various Gly/N-degrons. The structures reveal that ZYG11B and ZER1 utilize their armadillo (ARM) repeats forming a deep and narrow cavity to engage mainly the first four residues of Gly/N-degrons. The α-amino group of the Gly/N-degron is accommodated in an acidic pocket by five conserved hydrogen bonds. These structures, together with biochemical studies, decipher the molecular basis for the specific recognition of the Gly/N-degron by ZYG11B and ZER1, providing key information for future structure-based chemical probe design.

Abstract: Summary
Rice, a staple food with tropical/subtropical origination, is susceptible to cold stress, one of the major constraints on its yield and distribution. Asian cultivated rice consists of two subspecies with diverged chilling tolerance to adapt to different environments. The mechanism underlying this divergence remains obscure with a few known factors, including membrane protein CHILLING-TOLERANCE DIVERGENCE 1 (COLD1). Here, we reveal a vitamin E-vitamin K1 sub-network responsible for chilling tolerance divergence through global analyses. Rice genome regions responsible for tolerance divergence are identified with chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). Comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of chilling-tolerant CSSL4-1 and parent lines uncovered a vitamin E-vitamin K1 sub-network in chloroplast with tocopherol (vitamin E) mediating chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. COLD1, located in the substitution segment in CSSL4-1, is confirmed as its upstream regulator by transgenic material analysis. Our work uncovers a pathway downstream of COLD1, through which rice modulates chilling tolerance for thermal adaptation, with potential utility in crop improvement.

Abstract: Summary
Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is an ancient exoribonuclease conserved in the course of evolution and is found in species as diverse as bacteria and humans. Paradoxically, Escherichia coli PNPase can act not only as an RNA degrading enzyme but also by an unknown mechanism as a chaperone for small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), with pleiotropic consequences for gene regulation. We present structures of the ternary assembly formed by PNPase, the RNA chaperone Hfq, and sRNA and show that this complex boosts sRNA stability in vitro. Comparison of structures for PNPase in RNA carrier and degradation modes reveals how the RNA is rerouted away from the active site through interactions with Hfq and the KH and S1 domains. Together, these data explain how PNPase is repurposed to protect sRNAs from cellular ribonucleases such as RNase E and could aid RNA presentation to facilitate regulatory actions on target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes are the recycling center and nutrient signaling hub of the cell. Here, we show that lysosomes also control mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation by proteomic reprogramming. The chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) lysosome subgroup promotes osteogenesis, while suppressing adipogenesis, by selectively removing osteogenesis-deterring factors, especially master transcriptional factors, such as adipogenic TLE3, ZNF423, and chondrogenic SOX9. The activity of the CMA-committed lysosomes in MSCs are controlled by Van-Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2) at lysosomes. Vangl2 directly binds to lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A) and targets it for degradation. MSC-specific Vangl2 ablation in mice increases LAMP-2A expression and CMA-lysosome numbers, promoting bone formation while reducing marrow fat. The Vangl2:LAMP-2A ratio in MSCs correlates inversely with the capacity of the cells for osteoblastic differentiation in humans and mice. These findings demonstrate a critical role for lysosomes in MSC lineage acquisition and establish Vangl2-LAMP-2A signaling as a critical control mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Polyamines, small organic polycations, are essential for cell viability, and their physiological levels are homeostatically maintained by post-transcriptional regulation of key biosynthetic enzymes. In addition to de novo synthesis, cells can also take up polyamines; however, identifying cellular polyamine transporters has been challenging. Here we show that the S. cerevisiae HOL1 mRNA is under translational control by polyamines, and we reveal that the encoded membrane transporter Hol1 is a high-affinity polyamine transporter and is required for yeast growth under limiting polyamine conditions. Moreover, we show that polyamine inhibition of the translation factor eIF5A impairs translation termination at a Pro-Ser-stop motif in a conserved upstream open reading frame on the HOL1 mRNA to repress Hol1 synthesis under conditions of elevated polyamines. Our findings reveal that polyamine transport, like polyamine biosynthesis, is under translational autoregulation by polyamines in yeast, highlighting the extensive control cells impose on polyamine levels.

Abstract: Summary
Female human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) routinely undergo inactive X (Xi) erosion. This progressive loss of key repressive features follows the loss of XIST expression, the long non-coding RNA driving X inactivation, and causes reactivation of silenced genes across the eroding X (Xe). To date, the sporadic and progressive nature of erosion has obscured its scale, dynamics, and key transition events. To address this problem, we perform an integrated analysis of DNA methylation (DNAme), chromatin accessibility, and gene expression across hundreds of hPSC samples. Differential DNAme orders female hPSCs across a trajectory from initiation to terminal Xi erosion. Our results identify a cis-regulatory element crucial for XIST expression, trace contiguously growing reactivated domains to a few euchromatic origins, and indicate that the late-stage Xe impairs DNAme genome-wide. Surprisingly, from this altered regulatory landscape emerge select features of naive pluripotency, suggesting that its link to X dosage may be partially conserved in human embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
MED20 is a non-essential subunit of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator complex, but its physiological function remains largely unknown. Here, we identify MED20 as a substrate of the anti-obesity CRL4-WDTC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through affinity purification and candidate screening. Overexpression of WDTC1 leads to degradation of MED20, whereas depletion of WDTC1 or CUL4A/B causes accumulation of MED20. Depleting MED20 inhibits adipogenesis, and a non-degradable MED20 mutant restores adipogenesis in WDTC1-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, knockout of Med20 in preadipocytes abolishes development of brown adipose tissues. Removing one allele of Med20 in preadipocytes protects mice from diet-induced obesity and reverses weight gain in Cul4a- or Cul4b-depleted mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals that MED20 organizes the early adipogenic complex by bridging C/EBPβ and RNA polymerase II to promote transcription of the central adipogenic factor, PPARγ. Our findings have thus uncovered a critical role of MED20 in promoting adipogenesis, development of adipose tissue and diet-induced obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses are traditionally thought to be under selective pressure to maintain compact genomes and thus depend on host cell translational machinery for reproduction. However, some viruses encode abundant tRNA and other translation-related genes, potentially optimizing for codon usage differences between phage and host. Here, we systematically interrogate selective advantages that carrying 18 tRNAs may convey to a T4-like Vibriophage. Host DNA and RNA degrade upon infection, including host tRNAs, which are replaced by those of the phage. These tRNAs are expressed at levels slightly better adapted to phage codon usage, especially that of late genes. The phage is unlikely to randomly acquire as diverse an array of tRNAs as observed (p = 0.0017). Together, our results support that the main driver behind phage tRNA acquisition is pressure to sustain translation as host machinery degrades, a process resulting in a dynamically adapted codon usage strategy during the course of infection.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatic lipid accumulation in obesity correlates with the severity of hyperinsulinemia and systemic insulin resistance. Obesity-induced hepatocellular lipid accumulation results in hepatocyte depolarization. We have established that hepatocyte depolarization depresses hepatic afferent vagal nerve firing, increases GABA release from liver slices, and causes hyperinsulinemia. Preventing hepatic GABA release or eliminating the ability of the liver to communicate to the hepatic vagal nerve ameliorates the hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance associated with diet-induced obesity. In people with obesity, hepatic expression of GABA transporters is associated with glucose infusion and disposal rates during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in hepatic GABA re-uptake transporters are associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein, we identify GABA as a neuro-hepatokine that is dysregulated in obesity and whose release can be manipulated to mute or exacerbate the glucoregulatory dysfunction common to obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrence of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infections has been attributed to reactivation of quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs) in deep layers of the bladder wall. QIRs are thought to arise late during infection following dispersal of bacteria from intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) in superficial umbrella cells. Here, we track the formation of QIR-like bacteria in a bladder organoid model that recapitulates the stratified uroepithelium within a volume suitable for high-resolution live-cell imaging. Bacteria injected into the organoid lumen enter umbrella-like cells and proliferate to form IBC-like bodies. In parallel, single bacteria penetrate deeper layers of the organoid wall, where they localize within or between uroepithelial cells. These “solitary” bacteria evade killing by antibiotics and neutrophils and are morphologically distinct from bacteria in IBCs. We conclude that bacteria with QIR-like properties may arise at early stages of infection, independent of IBC formation and rupture.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of regulatory T (Treg) cells to control the immune response and limit the development of autoimmune diseases is determined by distinct molecular processes, which are not fully understood. We show here that serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), which is decreased in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, is necessary for the homeostasis and proper function of Treg cells, because its conditional absence in these cells leads to profound autoimmunity and organ inflammation by elevating the glycolytic metabolism and mTORC1 activity and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Our data reveal a molecular mechanism that controls Treg cell plasticity and offer insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells are metabolically similar to their corresponding normal tissues. Differences between cancers and normal tissues may reflect reprogramming during transformation or maintenance of the metabolism of the specific normal cell type that originated the cancer. Here, we compare glucose metabolism in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Thymus T cell progenitors were glucose avid and oxidized more glucose in the tricarboxylic acid cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) as compared with other hematopoietic cells. PDH deletion decreased double-positive T cell progenitor cells but had no effect on hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitors, or other hematopoietic cells. PDH deletion blocked the development of Pten-deficient T cell leukemia, but not the development of a Pten-deficient myeloid neoplasm. Therefore, the requirement for PDH in leukemia reflected the metabolism of the normal cell of origin independently of the driver genetic lesion. PDH was required to prevent pyruvate accumulation and maintain glutathione levels and redox homeostasis.
