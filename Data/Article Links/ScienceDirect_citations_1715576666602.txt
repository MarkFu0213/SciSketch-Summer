Abstract: Summary
Diabetes-associated atherosclerosis involves excessive immune cell recruitment and plaque formation. However, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Transcriptomic analysis of the aortic intima in Ldlr−/− mice on a high-fat, high-sucrose-containing (HFSC) diet identifies a macrophage-enriched nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), MERRICAL (macrophage-enriched lncRNA regulates inflammation, chemotaxis, and atherosclerosis). MERRICAL expression increases by 249% in intimal lesions during progression. lncRNA-mRNA pair genomic mapping reveals that MERRICAL positively correlates with the chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl4. MERRICAL-deficient macrophages exhibit lower Ccl3 and Ccl4 expression, chemotaxis, and inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, MERRICAL guides the WDR5-MLL1 complex to activate CCL3 and CCL4 transcription via H3K4me3 modification. MERRICAL deficiency in HFSC diet-fed Ldlr−/− mice reduces lesion formation by 74% in the aortic sinus and 86% in the descending aorta by inhibiting leukocyte recruitment into the aortic wall and pro-inflammatory responses. These findings unveil a regulatory mechanism whereby a macrophage-enriched lncRNA potently inhibits chemotactic responses, alleviating lesion progression in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by hemizygous loss of 26–28 genes at 7q11.23, characteristically portray a hypersocial phenotype. Copy-number variations and mutations in one of these genes, GTF2I, are associated with altered sociality and are proposed to underlie hypersociality in WS. However, the contribution of GTF2I to human neurodevelopment remains poorly understood. Here, human cellular models of neurodevelopment, including neural progenitors, neurons, and three-dimensional cortical organoids, are differentiated from CRISPR-Cas9-edited GTF2I-knockout (GTF2I-KO) pluripotent stem cells to investigate the role of GTF2I in human neurodevelopment. GTF2I-KO progenitors exhibit increased proliferation and cell-cycle alterations. Cortical organoids and neurons demonstrate increased cell death and synaptic dysregulation, including synaptic structural dysfunction and decreased electrophysiological activity on a multielectrode array. Our findings suggest that changes in synaptic circuit integrity may be a prominent mediator of the link between alterations in GTF2I and variation in the phenotypic expression of human sociality.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we explore the dynamic process of colorectal cancer progression, emphasizing the evolution toward a more metastatic phenotype. The term “evolution” as used in this study specifically denotes the phenotypic transition toward a higher metastatic potency from well-formed glandular structures to collective invasion, ultimately resulting in the development of cancer cell buddings at the invasive front. Our findings highlight the spatial correlation of this evolution with tumor cell senescence, revealing distinct types of senescent tumor cells (types I and II) that play different roles in the overall cancer progression. Type I senescent tumor cells (p16INK4A+/CXCL12+/LAMC2−/MMP7−) are identified in the collective invasion region, whereas type II senescent tumor cells (p16INK4A+/CXCL12+/LAMC2+/MMP7+), representing the final evolved form, are prominently located in the partial-EMT region. Importantly, type II senescent tumor cells associate with local invasion and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer, potentially affecting patient prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Argonaute (AGO) proteins are evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins that control gene expression through the small RNAs they interact with. Whether AGOs have regulatory roles independent of RNAs, however, is unknown. Here, we show that AGO1 controls cell fate decisions through facilitating protein folding. We found that in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), while AGO2 facilitates differentiation via the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, AGO1 controls stemness independently of its binding to small RNAs. We determined that AGO1 specifically interacts with HOP, a co-chaperone for the HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones, and enhances the folding of a set of HOP client proteins with intrinsically disordered regions. This AGO1-mediated facilitation of protein folding is important for maintaining stemness in mESCs. Our results demonstrate divergent functions between AGO1 and AGO2 in controlling cellular states and identify an RNA-independent function of AGO1 in controlling gene expression and cell fate decisions.

Abstract: Summary
SWI/SNF complexes are evolutionarily conserved, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines. Here, we characterize the features of SWI/SNF-dependent genes using BRM014, an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the complexes. We find that SWI/SNF activity is required to maintain chromatin accessibility and nucleosome occupancy for most enhancers but not for most promoters. SWI/SNF activity is needed for expression of genes with low to medium levels of expression that have promoters with (1) low chromatin accessibility, (2) low levels of active histone marks, (3) high H3K4me1/H3K4me3 ratio, (4) low nucleosomal phasing, and (5) enrichment in TATA-box motifs. These promoters are mostly occupied by the canonical Brahma-related gene 1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) complex. These genes are surrounded by SWI/SNF-dependent enhancers and mainly encode signal transduction, developmental, and cell identity genes (with almost no housekeeping genes). Machine-learning models trained with different chromatin characteristics of promoters and their surrounding regulatory regions indicate that the chromatin landscape is a determinant for establishing SWI/SNF dependency.

Abstract: Summary
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are an emerging tool to predict the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of individuals. We propose PRSmix, a framework that leverages the PRS corpus of a target trait to improve prediction accuracy, and PRSmix+, which incorporates genetically correlated traits to better capture the human genetic architecture for 47 and 32 diseases/traits in European and South Asian ancestries, respectively. PRSmix demonstrated a mean prediction accuracy improvement of 1.20-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], [1.10; 1.3]; p = 9.17 × 10−5) and 1.19-fold (95% CI, [1.11; 1.27]; p = 1.92 × 10−6), and PRSmix+ improved the prediction accuracy by 1.72-fold (95% CI, [1.40; 2.04]; p = 7.58 × 10−6) and 1.42-fold (95% CI, [1.25; 1.59]; p = 8.01 × 10−7) in European and South Asian ancestries, respectively. Compared to the previously cross-trait-combination methods with scores from pre-defined correlated traits, we demonstrated that our method improved prediction accuracy for coronary artery disease up to 3.27-fold (95% CI, [2.1; 4.44]; p value after false discovery rate (FDR) correction = 2.6 × 10−4). Our method provides a comprehensive framework to benchmark and leverage the combined power of PRS for maximal performance in a desired target population.

Abstract: Summary
The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediates epigenetic maintenance of gene silencing in eukaryotes via methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27). Accessory factors define two distinct subtypes, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2, with different actions and chromatin-targeting mechanisms. The mechanisms orchestrating PRC2 assembly are not fully understood. Here, we report that alternative splicing (AS) of PRC2 core component SUZ12 generates an uncharacterized isoform SUZ12-S, which co-exists with the canonical SUZ12-L isoform in virtually all tissues and developmental stages. SUZ12-S drives PRC2.1 formation and favors PRC2 dimerization. While SUZ12-S is necessary and sufficient for the repression of target genes via promoter-proximal H3K27me3 deposition, SUZ12-L maintains global H3K27 methylation levels. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking either isoform exit pluripotency more slowly and fail to acquire neuronal cell identity. Our findings reveal a physiological mechanism regulating PRC2 assembly and higher-order interactions in eutherians, with impacts on H3K27 methylation and gene repression.

Abstract: Background/purpose
Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)/ gel porous scaffolds loaded with WSM carriers are promising bone replacement materials that can improve osseointegration ability. This investigation aimed to evaluate the osteoinductive activity by implanting the composition of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)/ Gel porous scaffolds as a carrier of WSM via an animal model. Materials and methods: WSM was extracted and nHA was added to the matrix to construct porous composite scaffolds. The dose-effect curve of WSM concentration and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was made by culturing rat osteoblasts and examining the absorbance. Three different materials were implanted into critical size defects (CSD) in the skulls of rats, which were further divided into four groups: WSM nHA /Gel group, n-WSM nHA /Gel group, HA powder group, and control group. Results: WSM (150 μg/mL-250μg/mL) effectively improved the activity of ALP in rat osteoblasts. All rats in each group had normal healing. WSM-loaded nHA /Gel group showed better performance on newly-formed bone tissue of rat skull and back at 4th week and 8th week, respectively. At the 4th week, the network of woven bone formed in the WSM-loaded nHA/Gel scaffold material. At 8th week, the reticular trabecular bone in the WSM-loaded scaffold material became dense lamellar bone, and the defect was mature lamellar bone. In the subcutaneous implantation experiment, WSM-loaded nHA/Gel scaffold material showed a better performance of heterotopic ossification than the pure nHA/Gel scaffold material. Conclusion: WSM promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization. The results confirm that the nHA/ Gel Porous Scaffold with Nacre Water-Soluble Matrix has a significant bone promoting effect and can be used as a choice for tissue engineering to repair bone defects.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, encoded by both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, are essential producers of cellular ATP, but how nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression steps are coordinated to achieve balanced OXPHOS subunit biogenesis remains unresolved. Here, we present a parallel quantitative analysis of the human nuclear and mitochondrial messenger RNA (mt-mRNA) life cycles, including transcript production, processing, ribosome association, and degradation. The kinetic rates of nearly every stage of gene expression differed starkly across compartments. Compared with nuclear mRNAs, mt-mRNAs were produced 1,100-fold more, degraded 7-fold faster, and accumulated to 160-fold higher levels. Quantitative modeling and depletion of mitochondrial factors LRPPRC and FASTKD5 identified critical points of mitochondrial regulatory control, revealing that the mitonuclear expression disparities intrinsically arise from the highly polycistronic nature of human mitochondrial pre-mRNA. We propose that resolving these differences requires a 100-fold slower mitochondrial translation rate, illuminating the mitoribosome as a nexus of mitonuclear co-regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The development of cancer is an evolutionary process involving the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations that disrupt normal biological processes, enabling tumor cells to rapidly proliferate and eventually invade and metastasize to other tissues. We investigated the genomic evolution of prostate cancer through the application of three separate classification methods, each designed to investigate a different aspect of tumor evolution. Integrating the results revealed the existence of two distinct types of prostate cancer that arise from divergent evolutionary trajectories, designated as the Canonical and Alternative evolutionary disease types. We therefore propose the evotype model for prostate cancer evolution wherein Alternative-evotype tumors diverge from those of the Canonical-evotype through the stochastic accumulation of genetic alterations associated with disruptions to androgen receptor DNA binding. Our model unifies many previous molecular observations, providing a powerful new framework to investigate prostate cancer disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor MAFB regulates various homeostatic functions of macrophages. This study explores the role of MAFB in brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis using macrophage-specific Mafb-deficient (Mafbf/f::LysM-Cre) mice. We find that Mafb deficiency in macrophages reduces thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and sympathetic neuron (SN) density in BAT under cold conditions. This phenotype features a proinflammatory environment that is characterized by macrophage/granulocyte accumulation, increases in interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, and IL-6 trans-signaling, which lead to decreases in nerve growth factor (NGF) expression and reduction in SN density in BAT. We confirm MAFB regulation of IL-6 expression using luciferase readout driven by IL-6 promoter in RAW-264.7 macrophage cell lines. Immunohistochemistry shows clustered organization of NGF-producing cells in BAT, which are primarily TRPV1+ vascular smooth muscle cells, as additionally shown using single-cell RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR of the stromal vascular fraction. Treating Mafbf/f::LysM-Cre mice with anti-IL-6 receptor antibody rescues SN density, body temperature, and energy expenditure.

Abstract: Summary
An intriguing effect of short-term caloric restriction (CR) is the expansion of certain stem cell populations, including muscle stem cells (satellite cells), which facilitate an accelerated regenerative program after injury. Here, we utilized the MetRSL274G (MetRS) transgenic mouse to identify liver-secreted plasminogen as a candidate for regulating satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Knockdown of circulating plasminogen prevents satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Furthermore, loss of the plasminogen receptor KT (Plg-RKT) is also sufficient to prevent CR-related satellite cell expansion, consistent with direct signaling of plasminogen through the plasminogen receptor Plg-RKT/ERK kinase to promote proliferation of satellite cells. Importantly, we are able to replicate many of these findings in human participants from the CALERIE trial. Our results demonstrate that CR enhances liver protein secretion of plasminogen, which signals directly to the muscle satellite cell through Plg-RKT to promote proliferation and subsequent muscle resilience during CR.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate DNA end synapsis, regulated by core components of the synaptic complex including KU70-KU80, LIG4, XRCC4, and XLF, is central to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of chromatinized DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, it remains enigmatic whether chromatin modifications can influence the formation of NHEJ synaptic complex at DNA ends, and if so, how this is achieved. Here, we report that the mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC) serves as a key regulator of DNA end synapsis during NHEJ repair in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, MiDAC removes combinatorial acetyl marks on histone H2A (H2AK5acK9ac) around DSB-proximal chromatin, suppressing hyperaccumulation of bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 that would otherwise undergo liquid-liquid phase separation with KU80 and prevent the proper installation of LIG4-XRCC4-XLF onto DSB ends. This study provides mechanistic insight into the control of NHEJ synaptic complex assembly by a specific chromatin signature and highlights the critical role of H2A hypoacetylation in restraining unscheduled compartmentalization of DNA repair machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Infection of mice by mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) triggers activation and expansion of Ly49H+ natural killer (NK) cells, which are virus specific and considered to be “adaptive” or “memory” NK cells. Here, we find that signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family receptors (SFRs), a group of hematopoietic cell-restricted receptors, are essential for the expansion of Ly49H+ NK cells after MCMV infection. This activity is largely mediated by CD48, an SFR broadly expressed on NK cells and displaying augmented expression after MCMV infection. It is also dependent on the CD48 counter-receptor, 2B4, expressed on host macrophages. The 2B4-CD48 axis promotes expansion of Ly49H+ NK cells by repressing their phagocytosis by virus-activated macrophages through inhibition of the pro-phagocytic integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on macrophages. These data identify key roles of macrophages and the 2B4-CD48 pathway in controlling the expansion of adaptive NK cells following MCMV infection. Stimulation of the 2B4-CD48 axis may be helpful in enhancing adaptive NK cell responses for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Chondrocytes undergo endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced apoptosis under abnormal stimulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the regulatory effect of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on ERS and its effect on chondrocyte apoptosis. In addition, we established a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) model in rats to induce temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA). Chondrocytes were isolated from the temporomandibular joints and treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Protein expression of ERS and apoptosis markers (GRP78 and CASP12) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The expression of GRP78, CASP12, p-PI3K, and p-AKT significantly increased in the UAC group. LY294002, a PI3K/AKT signaling pathway inhibitor, reduced the protein expression of GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, and CASP12, whereas 740 Y-P, an activation agent, elevated the expression of proteins GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, and CASP12. In the present study, UAC and LPS stimulation induced apoptosis of chondrocytes in the ERS pathway. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway reduced ERS-induced chondrocyte apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD ligand-1 (PD-L1)-mediated immune escape contributes to cancer development and has been targeted as an anti-cancer strategy. Here, we show that inhibition of the RNA helicase DDX3 increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in syngeneic oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors. DDX3 knockdown compromised interferon-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and, in particular, reduced the level of cell-surface PD-L1. DDX3 promoted surface PD-L1 expression by recruiting the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex to the 3′ UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. DDX3 depletion or 3′ UTR truncation increased the binding of the coatomer protein complexes to PD-L1, leading to its intracellular accumulation. Therefore, this 3′ UTR-dependent mechanism may counteract cellular negative effects on surface trafficking of PD-L1. Finally, pharmaceutic disruption of DDX3’s interaction with AP2 reduced surface PD-L1 expression, supporting that the DDX3-AP2 pathway routes PD-L1 to the cell surface. Targeting DDX3 to modulate surface trafficking of immune checkpoint proteins may provide a potential strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The deciduous tree Idesia polycarpa can provide premium edible oil with high polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. Here, we generate its high-quality reference genome, which is ∼1.21 Gb, comprising 21 pseudochromosomes and 42,086 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic and genomic synteny analyses show that it diverged with Populus trichocarpa about 16.28 million years ago. Notably, most fatty acid biosynthesis genes are not only increased in number in its genome but are also highly expressed in the fruits. Moreover, we identify, through genome-wide association analysis and RNA sequencing, the I. polycarpa SUGAR TRANSPORTER 5 (IpSTP5) gene as a positive regulator of high oil accumulation in the fruits. Silencing of IpSTP5 by virus-induced gene silencing causes a significant reduction of oil content in the fruits, suggesting it has the potential to be used as a molecular marker to breed the high-oil-content cultivars. Our results collectively lay the foundation for breeding the elite cultivars of I. polycarpa.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells exhibit dramatic differences in gene expression at the single-cell level, which can predict whether they become resistant to treatment. Treatment perpetuates this heterogeneity, resulting in a diversity of cell states among resistant clones. However, it remains unclear whether these differences lead to distinct responses when another treatment is applied or the same treatment is continued. In this study, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with barcoding to track resistant clones through prolonged and sequential treatments. We found that cells within the same clone have similar gene expression states after multiple rounds of treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that individual clones have distinct and differing fates, including growth, survival, or death, when subjected to a second treatment or when the first treatment is continued. By identifying gene expression states that predict clone survival, this work provides a foundation for selecting optimal therapies that target the most aggressive resistant clones within a tumor. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a congenital defect that usually results from aberrant development of embryonic pharyngeal arches. However, the molecular basis of CFM pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we employ the zebrafish model to investigate mechanisms of CFM pathogenesis. In early embryos, tet2 and tet3 are essential for pharyngeal cartilage development. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that loss of Tet2/3 impairs chondrocyte differentiation due to insufficient BMP signaling. Moreover, biochemical and genetic evidence reveals that the sequence-specific 5mC/5hmC-binding protein, Sall4, binds the promoter of bmp4 to activate bmp4 expression and control pharyngeal cartilage development. Mechanistically, Sall4 directs co-phase separation of Tet2/3 with Sall4 to form condensates that mediate 5mC oxidation on the bmp4 promoter, thereby promoting bmp4 expression and enabling sufficient BMP signaling. These findings suggest the TET-BMP-Sall4 regulatory axis is critical for pharyngeal cartilage development. Collectively, our study provides insights into understanding craniofacial development and CFM pathogenesis.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Considering the recent increase in the number of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases in South Korea, we aimed to clarify the molecular characteristics of CRC unique to the Korean population. To gain insights into the complexities of CRC and promote the exchange of critical data, RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to reveal the molecular mechanisms that drive the development and progression of CRC; this analysis is critical for developing effective treatment strategies. We performed RNA-sequencing analysis of CRC and adjacent normal tissue samples from 214 Korean participants (comprising a total of 381 including 169 normal and 212 tumor samples) to investigate differential gene expression between the groups. We identified 19,575 genes expressed in CRC and normal tissues, with 3,830 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the groups. Functional annotation analysis revealed that the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways related to the cell cycle, DNA replication, and IL-17, whereas the downregulated DEGs were enriched in metabolic pathways. We also analyzed the relationship between clinical information and subtypes using the Consensus Molecular Subtype (CMS) classification. Furthermore, we compared groups clustered within our dataset to CMS groups and performed additional analysis of the methylation data between DEGs and CMS groups to provide comprehensive biological insights from various perspectives. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC in Korean patients and serves as a platform for identifying potential target genes for this disease. The raw data and processed results have been deposited in a public repository for further analysis and exploration.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas9 short guide RNA (sgRNA) library screening is a powerful approach to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena. However, its in vivo application is currently limited. Here, we developed our previously established in vitro revival screening method into an in vivo one to identify factors involved in spermatogenesis integrity by utilizing sperm capacitation as an indicator. By introducing an sgRNA library into testicular cells, we successfully pinpointed the retinal degeneration 3 (Rd3) gene as a significant factor in spermatogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis highlighted the high expression of Rd3 in round spermatids, and proteomics analysis indicated that Rd3 interacts with mitochondria. To search for cell-type-specific signaling pathways based on scRNA-seq and proteomics analyses, we developed a computational tool, Hub-Explorer. Through this, we discovered that Rd3 modulates oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial distribution upon ciliogenesis induction. Collectively, our screening system provides a valuable in vivo approach to decipher molecular mechanisms in biological processes.

Abstract: Summary
To mount an adaptive immune response, dendritic cells must migrate to lymph nodes to present antigens to T cells. Critical to 3D migration is the nucleus, which is the size-limiting barrier for migration through the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that inflammatory activation of dendritic cells leads to the nucleus becoming spherically deformed and enables dendritic cells to overcome the typical 2- to 3-μm diameter limit for 3D migration through gaps in the extracellular matrix. We show that the nuclear shape change is partially attained through reduced cell adhesion, whereas improved 3D migration is achieved through reprogramming of the actin cytoskeleton. Specifically, our data point to a model whereby the phosphorylation of cofilin-1 at serine 41 drives the assembly of a cofilin-actomyosin ring proximal to the nucleus and enhances migration through 3D collagen gels. In summary, these data describe signaling events through which dendritic cells deform their nucleus and enhance their migratory capacity.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) of messenger RNAs occurs in ∼95% of multi-exon human genes and generates diverse RNA and protein isoforms. We investigated AS events associated with human epidermal differentiation, a process crucial for skin function. We identified 6,413 AS events, primarily involving cassette exons. We also predicted 34 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulating epidermal AS, including 19 previously undescribed candidate regulators. From these results, we identified FUS as an RBP that regulates the balance between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, we characterized the function of a cassette exon AS event in MAP3K7, which encodes a kinase involved in cell signaling. We found that a switch from the short to long isoform of MAP3K7, triggered during differentiation, enforces the demarcation between proliferating basal progenitors and overlying differentiated strata. Our findings indicate that AS occurs extensively in the human epidermis and has critical roles in skin homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy and ribonucleoprotein granules, such as P-bodies (PBs) and stress granules, represent vital stress responses to maintain cellular homeostasis. SQSTM1/p62 phase-separated droplets are known to play critical roles in selective autophagy; however, it is unknown whether p62 can exist as another form in addition to its autophagic droplets. Here, we found that, under stress conditions, including proteotoxicity, endotoxicity, and oxidation, autophagic p62 droplets are transformed to a type of enlarged PBs, termed p62-dependent P-bodies (pd-PBs). p62 phase separation is essential for the nucleation of pd-PBs. Mechanistically, pd-PBs are triggered by enhanced p62 droplet formation upon stress stimulation through the interactions between p62 and DDX6, a DEAD-box ATPase. Functionally, pd-PBs recruit the NLRP3 inflammasome adaptor ASC to assemble the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce inflammation-associated cytotoxicity. Our study shows that p62 droplet-to-PB transformation acts as a stress response to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome process, suggesting that persistent pd-PBs lead to NLRP3-dependent inflammation toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Genes limiting T cell antitumor activity may serve as therapeutic targets. It has not been systematically studied whether there are regulators that uniquely or broadly contribute to T cell fitness. We perform genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in primary CD8 T cells to uncover genes negatively impacting fitness upon three modes of stimulation: (1) intense, triggering activation-induced cell death (AICD); (2) acute, triggering expansion; (3) chronic, causing dysfunction. Besides established regulators, we uncover genes controlling T cell fitness either specifically or commonly upon differential stimulation. Dap5 ablation, ranking highly in all three screens, increases translation while enhancing tumor killing. Loss of Icam1-mediated homotypic T cell clustering amplifies cell expansion and effector functions after both acute and intense stimulation. Lastly, Ctbp1 inactivation induces functional T cell persistence exclusively upon chronic stimulation. Our results functionally annotate fitness regulators based on their unique or shared contribution to traits limiting T cell antitumor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy eliminates cytoplasmic material by engulfment in membranous vesicles targeted for lysosome degradation. Nonselective autophagy coordinates sequestration of bulk cargo with the growth of the isolation membrane (IM) in a yet-unknown manner. Here, we show that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, IMs expand while maintaining a rim sufficiently wide for sequestration of large cargo but tight enough to mature in due time. An obligate complex of Atg24/Snx4 with Atg20 or Snx41 assembles locally at the rim in a spatially extended manner that specifically depends on autophagic PI(3)P. This assembly stabilizes the open rim to promote autophagic sequestration of large cargo in correlation with vesicle expansion. Moreover, constriction of the rim by the PI(3)P-dependent Atg2-Atg18 complex and clearance of PI(3)P by Ymr1 antagonize rim opening to promote autophagic maturation and consumption of small cargo. Tight regulation of membrane rim aperture by PI(3)P thus couples the mechanism and physiology of nonselective autophagy.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Aging is accompanied by the gradual deregulation of the transcriptome. However, whether age-dependent changes in the transcriptome are evolutionarily conserved or diverged remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed a meta-analysis examining the age-dependent changes in the transcriptome using publicly available datasets of 11 representative metazoans, ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. To identify the transcriptomic changes associated with aging, we analyzed various aspects of the transcriptome, including genome composition, RNA processing, and functional consequences. The use of introns and novel splice sites tended to increase with age, particularly in the brain. In addition, our analysis suggests that the age-dependent accumulation of premature termination codon-containing transcripts is a common feature of aging across multiple animal species. Using C. elegans as a test model, we showed that several splicing factors that are evolutionarily conserved and age-dependently downregulated were required to maintain a normal lifespan. Thus, aberrant RNA processing appears to be associated with aging and a short lifespan in various species.

Abstract: Summary
Chloroplasts contain a dedicated genome that encodes subunits of the photosynthesis machinery. Transcription of photosynthesis genes is predominantly carried out by a plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP), a nearly 1 MDa complex composed of core subunits with homology to eubacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and at least 12 additional chloroplast-specific PEP-associated proteins (PAPs). However, the architecture of this complex and the functions of the PAPs remain unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a 19-subunit PEP complex from Sinapis alba (white mustard). The structure reveals that the PEP core resembles prokaryotic and nuclear RNAPs but contains chloroplast-specific features that mediate interactions with the PAPs. The PAPs are unrelated to known transcription factors and arrange around the core in a unique fashion. Their structures suggest potential functions during transcription in the chemical environment of chloroplasts. These results reveal structural insights into chloroplast transcription and provide a framework for understanding photosynthesis gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Small non-coding RNAs can be secreted through a variety of mechanisms, including exosomal sorting, in small extracellular vesicles, and within lipoprotein complexes. However, the mechanisms that govern their sorting and secretion are not well understood. Here, we present ExoGRU, a machine learning model that predicts small RNA secretion probabilities from primary RNA sequences. We experimentally validated the performance of this model through ExoGRU-guided mutagenesis and synthetic RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, we used ExoGRU to reveal cis and trans factors that underlie small RNA secretion, including known and novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), e.g., YBX1, HNRNPA2B1, and RBM24. We also developed a novel technique called exoCLIP, which reveals the RNA interactome of RBPs within the cell-free space. Together, our results demonstrate the power of machine learning in revealing novel biological mechanisms. In addition to providing deeper insight into small RNA secretion, this knowledge can be leveraged in therapeutic and synthetic biology applications.

Abstract: Summary
Cells respond to lysosomal membrane permeabilization by membrane repair or selective macroautophagy of damaged lysosomes, termed lysophagy, but it is not fully understood how this decision is made. Here, we uncover a pathway in human cells that detects lipid bilayer perturbations in the limiting membrane of compromised lysosomes, which fail to be repaired, and then initiates ubiquitin-triggered lysophagy. We find that SPG20 binds the repair factor IST1 on damaged lysosomes and, importantly, integrates that with the detection of damage-associated lipid-packing defects of the lysosomal membrane. Detection occurs via sensory amphipathic helices in SPG20 before rupture of the membrane. If lipid-packing defects are extensive, such as during lipid peroxidation, SPG20 recruits and activates ITCH, which marks the damaged lysosome with lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains to initiate lysophagy and thus triages the lysosome for destruction. With SPG20 being linked to neurodegeneration, these findings highlight the relevance of a coordinated lysosomal damage response for cellular homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Primate hands house an array of mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors, which are essential for tactile and kinematic information crucial for daily motor action. While the regulation of these somatosensory signals is essential for hand movements, the specific central nervous system (CNS) location and mechanism remain unclear. Our study demonstrates the attenuation of somatosensory signals in the cuneate nucleus during voluntary movement, suggesting significant modulation at this initial relay station in the CNS. The attenuation is comparable to the cerebral cortex but more pronounced than in the spinal cord, indicating the cuneate nuclei’s role in somatosensory perception modulation during movement. Moreover, our findings suggest that the descending motor tract may regulate somatosensory transmission in the cuneate nucleus, enhancing relevant signals and suppressing unnecessary ones for the regulation of movement. This process of recurrent somatosensory modulation between cortical and subcortical areas could be a basic mechanism for modulating somatosensory signals to achieve active perception.

Abstract: Summary
The multi-domain protein UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1) recruits DNMT1 for DNA methylation maintenance during DNA replication. Here, we show that MOF (males absent on the first) acetylates UHRF1 at K670 in the pre-RING linker region, whereas HDAC1 deacetylates UHRF1 at the same site. We also identify that K667 and K668 can also be acetylated by MOF when K670 is mutated. The MOF/HDAC1-mediated acetylation in UHRF1 is cell-cycle regulated and peaks at G1/S phase, in line with the function of UHRF1 in recruiting DNMT1 to maintain DNA methylation. In addition, UHRF1 acetylation significantly enhances its E3 ligase activity. Abolishing UHRF1 acetylation at these sites attenuates UHRF1-mediated H3 ubiquitination, which in turn impairs DNMT1 recruitment and DNA methylation. Taken together, these findings identify MOF as an acetyltransferase for UHRF1 and define a mechanism underlying the regulation of DNA methylation maintenance through MOF-mediated UHRF1 acetylation.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, dosage compensation involves two parallel processes: (1) X inactivation, which equalizes X chromosome dosage between males and females, and (2) X hyperactivation, which upregulates the active X for X-autosome balance. The field currently favors models whereby dosage compensation initiates “de novo” during mouse development. Here, we develop “So-Smart-seq” to revisit the question and interrogate a comprehensive transcriptome including noncoding genes and repeats in mice. Intriguingly, de novo silencing pertains only to a subset of Xp genes. Evolutionarily older genes and repetitive elements demonstrate constitutive Xp silencing, adopt distinct signatures, and do not require Xist to initiate silencing. We trace Xp silencing backward in developmental time to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in the male germ line and observe that Xm hyperactivation is timed to Xp silencing on a gene-by-gene basis. Thus, during the gamete-to-embryo transition, older Xp genes are transmitted in a “pre-inactivated” state. These findings have implications for the evolution of imprinting.

Abstract: Summary
Infection, autoimmunity, and cancer are principal human health challenges of the 21st century. Often regarded as distinct ends of the immunological spectrum, recent studies hint at potential overlap between these diseases. For example, inflammation can be pathogenic in infection and autoimmunity. T resident memory (TRM) cells can be beneficial in infection and cancer. However, these findings are limited by size and scope; exact immunological factors shared across diseases remain elusive. Here, we integrate large-scale deeply clinically and biologically phenotyped human cohorts of 526 patients with infection, 162 with lupus, and 11,180 with cancer. We identify an NKG2A+ immune bias as associative with protection against disease severity, mortality, and autoimmune/post-acute chronic disease. We reveal that NKG2A+ CD8+ T cells correlate with reduced inflammation and increased humoral immunity and that they resemble TRM cells. Our results suggest NKG2A+ biases as a cross-disease factor of protection, supporting suggestions of immunological overlap between infection, autoimmunity, and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase is a master regulator of the DNA damage response and also an important sensor of oxidative stress. Analysis of gene expression in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patient brain tissue shows that large-scale transcriptional changes occur in patient cerebellum that correlate with the expression level and guanine-cytosine (GC) content of transcribed genes. In human neuron-like cells in culture, we map locations of poly(ADP-ribose) and RNA-DNA hybrid accumulation genome-wide with ATM inhibition and find that these marks also coincide with high transcription levels, active transcription histone marks, and high GC content. Antioxidant treatment reverses the accumulation of R-loops in transcribed regions, consistent with the central role of reactive oxygen species in promoting these lesions. Based on these results, we postulate that transcription-associated lesions accumulate in ATM-deficient cells and that the single-strand breaks and PARylation at these sites ultimately generate changes in transcription that compromise cerebellum function and lead to neurodegeneration over time in A-T patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit considerable heterogeneity in advanced cancers; however, the functional annotation and mechanism of CAFs in early-stage cancers remain elusive. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic, we identify a previously unknown PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAF subset in early-stage bladder cancer (BCa). Multicenter clinical analysis of a 910-case cohort confirms that PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAFs are associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and poor prognosis in early-stage BCa. These CAFs facilitate LVI and lymph node (LN) metastasis in early-stage BCa, as evidenced in a PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAFs-specific deficient mouse model. Mechanistically, PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAFs promote lymphangiogenesis via recognizing ITGA11 surface receptor SELE on lymphatic endothelial cells to activate SRC-p-VEGFR3-MAPK pathway. Further, CHI3L1 from PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAFs aligns the surrounding matrix to assist cancer cell intravasation, fostering early-stage BCa LVI and LN metastasis. Collectively, our study reveals the crucial role of PDGFRα+ITGA11+ CAFs in shaping metastatic landscape, informing the treatment of early-stage BCa LVI.

Abstract: Background
Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a newly developed strategy for treating acute liver failure (ALF). Nonetheless, the low survival rate of MSCs after transplantation and their poor homing to damaged tissues limit the clinical application of MSCs. The research assessed whether hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) can improve the biological activity of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hA-MSCs), promote their homing ability to the liver of mice with ALF, and influence liver tissue repair.
Methods
Flow cytometry, CCK8, Transwell, and Western blotting assays were conducted to assess the effects of hypoxic preconditioning on the phenotype, proliferation, and migration of hA-MSCs and the changes in the c-Met and CXCR4 gene expression levels were studied. To evaluate the effects of the transplantation of hypoxic preconditioning of hA-MSCs on the homing and repair of D-galactosamine (D-GalN)/LPS-induced ALF, the mechanism was elucidated by adding c-Met, CXCR4-specific blockers (SU11274 and AMD3100).
Results
After hypoxia pretreatment (1% oxygen volume fraction), hA-MSCs maintained the morphological characteristics of adherence and vortex colony growth and showed high CD44, CD90, and CD105 and low CD31, CD34, and CD45 expression levels. Hypoxic preconditioning of hA-MSCs significantly increased their proliferation and migration and highly expressed the c-Met and CXCR4 genes. In vivo and in vitro, this migration-promoting effect was suppressed by the c-Met specific blocker SU11274. In the acute liver failure mouse model, the HGF expression level was considerably elevated in the liver than that in the serum, lungs and kidneys. The transplantation of hypoxic preconditioned hA-MSCs introduced a remarkable improvement in the liver function and survival rate of mice with ALF and enhanced the anti-apoptosis ability of liver cells. The anti-apoptotic enhancing effect of hypoxic preconditioning was suppressed by the c-Met specific blocker SU11274. Hypoxic hA-MSCs administration was observed to have considerably increased the fluorescent cells in the liver than that recorded after administering normal oxygen-hA-MSCs. The number of hepatic fluorescent cells decreased remarkably after adding the c-Met inhibitor SU11274, compared to that recorded after hypoxic pretreatment, whereas the effect of c-Met inhibitor SU11274 on normal oxygen-hA-MSCs was not significant.
Conclusions
Hypoxic preconditioning depicted no impact on the morphology and phenotype features of the human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells, but it can promote their proliferation, migration, anti-apoptotic effect, and homing rate and improve the repair of acute liver failure, which might be mediated by the HGF/c-Met signaling axis.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular signaling molecules, such as the 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA), ensures proper cellular function. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the ubiquitous PKA regulatory subunit RIα promotes cAMP compartmentation and signaling specificity. However, the molecular determinants of RIα LLPS remain unclear. Here, we reveal that two separate dimerization interfaces, combined with the cAMP-induced unleashing of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-C) from the pseudosubstrate inhibitory sequence, drive RIα condensate formation in the cytosol of mammalian cells, which is antagonized by docking to A-kinase anchoring proteins. Strikingly, we find that the RIα pseudosubstrate region is critically involved in forming a non-canonical R:C complex, which recruits active PKA-C to RIα condensates to maintain low basal PKA activity in the cytosol. Our results suggest that RIα LLPS not only facilitates cAMP compartmentation but also spatially restrains active PKA-C, thus highlighting the functional versatility of biomolecular condensates in driving signaling specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we identify a subset of vascular pericytes, defined by expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-β) and G-protein-coupled receptor 91 (GPR91), that promote tumorigenesis and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance by functioning as the primary methionine source for cancer stem cells (CSCs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Tumor-cell-derived succinate binds to GPR91 on pericyte to activate autophagy for methionine production. CSCs use methionine to create stabilizing N6-methyladenosine in ATPase-family-AAA-domain-containing 2 (ATAD2) mRNA, and the resulting ATAD2 protein complexes with SRY-box transcription factor 9 to assemble super enhancers and thereby dictate its target genes that feature prominently in CSCs. Targeting PDGFR-β+GPR91+ pericytes with specific GRP91 antagonists reduce intratumoral methionine level, eliminate CSCs, and enhance TKIs sensitivity. These results unraveled the mechanisms by which PDGFR-β+GPR91+ pericytes provide supportive niche for CSCs and could be used to develop targets for treating ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Claudin-5 (CLDN5) is an endothelial tight junction protein essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation. Abnormal CLDN5 expression is common in brain disease, and knockdown of Cldn5 at the BBB has been proposed to facilitate drug delivery to the brain. To study the consequences of CLDN5 loss in the mature brain, we induced mosaic endothelial-specific Cldn5 gene ablation in adult mice (Cldn5iECKO). These mice displayed increased BBB permeability to tracers up to 10 kDa in size from 6 days post induction (dpi) and ensuing lethality from 10 dpi. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 11 dpi revealed profound transcriptomic differences in brain endothelial cells regardless of their Cldn5 status in mosaic mice, suggesting major non-cell-autonomous responses. Reactive microglia and astrocytes suggested rapid cellular responses to BBB leakage. Our study demonstrates a critical role for CLDN5 in the adult BBB and provides molecular insight into the consequences and risks associated with CLDN5 inhibition.

Abstract: Cell polarity is crucial for gastric mucosal barrier integrity and mainly regulated by polarity-regulating kinase partitioning-defective 1b (Par1b). During infection, the carcinogen Helicobacter pylori hijacks Par1b via the bacterial oncoprotein CagA leading to loss of cell polarity, but the precise molecular mechanism is not fully clear. Here we discovered a novel function of the actin-binding protein cortactin in regulating Par1b, which forms a complex with cortactin and the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). We found that serine phosphorylation at S405/418 and the SH3 domain of cortactin are important for its interaction with both Par1b and ZO-1. Cortactin knockout cells displayed disturbed Par1b cellular localization and exhibited morphological abnormalities that largely compromised transepithelial electrical resistance, epithelial cell polarity, and apical microvilli. H. pylori infection promoted cortactin/Par1b/ZO-1 abnormal interactions in the tight junctions in a CagA-dependent manner. Infection of human gastric organoid-derived mucosoids supported these observations. We therefore hypothesize that CagA disrupts gastric epithelial cell polarity by hijacking cortactin, and thus Par1b and ZO-1, suggesting a new signaling pathway for the development of gastric cancer by Helicobacter.

Abstract: Summary
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) promotes prandial liver metabolism by producing malonyl-CoA, a substrate for de novo lipogenesis and an inhibitor of CPT-1-mediated fat oxidation. We report that inhibition of ACC also produces unexpected secondary effects on metabolism. Liver-specific double ACC1/2 knockout (LDKO) or pharmacologic inhibition of ACC increased anaplerosis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, and gluconeogenesis by activating hepatic CPT-1 and pyruvate carboxylase flux in the fed state. Fasting should have marginalized the role of ACC, but LDKO mice maintained elevated TCA cycle intermediates and preserved glycemia during fasting. These effects were accompanied by a compensatory induction of proteolysis and increased amino acid supply for gluconeogenesis, which was offset by increased protein synthesis during feeding. Such adaptations may be related to Nrf2 activity, which was induced by ACC inhibition and correlated with fasting amino acids. The findings reveal unexpected roles for malonyl-CoA synthesis in liver and provide insight into the broader effects of pharmacologic ACC inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Liver injury stimulates hepatocyte replication and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, thereby driving liver regeneration. Aberrant HSC activation induces liver fibrosis. However, mechanisms underlying liver regeneration and fibrosis remain poorly understood. Here, we identify hepatic Snai1 and Snai2 as important transcriptional regulators for liver regeneration and fibrosis. Partial hepatectomy or CCl4 treatment increases occupancies of Snai1 and Snai2 on cyclin A2 and D1 promoters in the liver. Snai1 and Snai2 in turn increase promoter H3K27 acetylation and cyclin A2/D1 expressions. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of both Snai1 and Snai2, but not one alone, suppresses liver cyclin A2/D1 expression and regenerative hepatocyte proliferation after hepatectomy or CCl4 treatments but augments CCl4-stimulated HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Conversely, Snai2 overexpression in the liver enhances hepatocyte replication and suppresses liver fibrosis after CCl4 treatment. These results suggest that hepatic Snai1 and Snai2 directly promote, via histone modifications, reparative hepatocyte replication and indirectly inhibit liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is essential to elicit type I interferon cascade response; thus, the activity of cGAS must be strictly regulated to boost the antiviral innate immunity. Here, we report that cGAS is responsible for the DNA-induced ISG15 conjugation system. The E3 HERC5 catalyzes the ISGylation of cytoplasmic cGAS at lysine 21, 187, 219, and 458, whereas Ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 removes the ISGylation of cGAS. The interaction of cGAS and HERC5 depends on the cGAS C-terminal domain and the RRC1-4 and RRC1-5 domains of HERC5. Mechanically, HERC5-catalyzed ISGylation promotes DNA-induced cGAS oligomerization and enhances cGAS enzymatic activity. Deficiency of ISGylation attenuates the downstream inflammatory gene expression induced by the cGAS-STING axis and the antiviral ability in mouse and human cells. Mice deficient in Isg15 or Herc6 are more vulnerable to herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Collectively, our study shows a positive feedback regulation of the cGAS-mediated innate immune pathway by ISGylation.

Abstract: Summary
Experience-driven alterations in neuronal activity are followed by structural-functional modifications allowing cells to adapt to these activity changes. Structural plasticity has been observed for cortical principal cells. However, how GABAergic interneurons respond to experience-dependent network activity changes is not well understood. We show that parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs) of the dentate gyrus (DG) possess dendritic spines, which undergo behaviorally induced structural dynamics. Glutamatergic inputs at PVI spines evoke signals with high spatial compartmentalization defined by neck length. Mice experiencing novel contexts form more PVI spines with elongated necks and exhibit enhanced network and PVI activity and cFOS expression. Enhanced green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partner-mediated synapse labeling shows that experience-driven PVI spine growth boosts targeting of PVI spines over shafts by glutamatergic synapses. Our findings propose a role for PVI spine dynamics in regulating PVI excitation by their inputs, which may allow PVIs to dynamically adjust their functional integration in the DG microcircuitry in relation to network computational demands.

Abstract: Summary
Glia interact with multiple neurons, but it is unclear whether their interactions with each neuron are different. Our interrogation at single-cell resolution reveals that a single glial cell exhibits specificity in its interactions with different contacting neurons. Briefly, C. elegans amphid sheath (AMsh) glia apical-like domains contact 12 neuron-endings. At these ad-neuronal membranes, AMsh glia localize the K/Cl transporter KCC-3 to a microdomain exclusively around the thermosensory AFD neuron to regulate its properties. Glial KCC-3 is transported to ad-neuronal regions, where distal cilia of non-AFD glia-associated chemosensory neurons constrain it to a microdomain at AFD-contacting glial membranes. Aberrant KCC-3 localization impacts both thermosensory (AFD) and chemosensory (non-AFD) neuron properties. Thus, neurons can interact non-synaptically through a shared glial cell by regulating microdomain localization of its cues. As AMsh and glia across species compartmentalize multiple cues like KCC-3, we posit that this may be a broadly conserved glial mechanism that modulates information processing across multimodal circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Modeling tumor metabolism in vitro remains challenging. Here, we used galactose as an in vitro tool compound to mimic glycolytic limitation. In contrast to the established idea that high glycolytic flux reduces pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) activity to support anabolic processes, we have discovered that glycolytic limitation also affects PKM2 activity. Surprisingly, despite limited carbon availability and energetic stress, cells induce a near-complete block of PKM2 to divert carbons toward serine metabolism. Simultaneously, TCA cycle flux is sustained, and oxygen consumption is increased, supported by glutamine. Glutamine not only supports TCA cycle flux but also serine synthesis via distinct mechanisms that are directed through PKM2 inhibition. Finally, deleting mitochondrial one-carbon (1C) cycle reversed the PKM2 block, suggesting a potential formate-dependent crosstalk that coordinates mitochondrial 1C flux and cytosolic glycolysis to support cell survival and proliferation during nutrient-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The self-incompatibility system evolves in angiosperms to promote cross-pollination by rejecting self-pollination. Here, we show the involvement of Exo84c in the SI response of both Brassica napus and Arabidopsis. The expression of Exo84c is specifically elevated in stigma during the SI response. Knocking out Exo84c in B. napus and SI Arabidopsis partially breaks down the SI response. The SI response inhibits both the protein secretion in papillae and the recruitment of the exocyst complex to the pollen-pistil contact sites. Interestingly, these processes can be partially restored in exo84c SI Arabidopsis. After incompatible pollination, the turnover of the exocyst-labeled compartment is enhanced in papillae. However, this process is perturbed in exo84c SI Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results suggest that Exo84c regulates the exocyst complex vacuolar degradation during the SI response. This process is likely independent of the known SI pathway in Brassicaceae to secure the SI response.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
A comprehensive regulatory network of transcription factors controls the dorsoventral patterning of the body axis in developing vertebrate embryos. Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is essential for activating the Ventx family of homeodomain transcription factors, which regulates embryonic patterning and germ layer identity during Xenopus gastrulation. Although Ventx1.1 and Ventx2.1 of the Xenopus Ventx family have been extensively investigated, Ventx3.2 remains largely understudied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the transcriptional regulation of ventx3.2 during the embryonic development of Xenopus. We used goosecoid (Gsc) genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data to isolate and replicate the promoter region of ventx3.2. Serial deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were used to identify the cis-acting elements for Gsc and caudal type homeobox 1 (Cdx1) within the ventx3.2 promoter. Cdx1 and Gsc differentially regulated ventx3.2 transcription in this study. Additionally, positive cis-acting and negative response elements were observed for Cdx1 and Gsc, respectively, within the 5′ flanking region of the ventx3.2 promoter. This result was corroborated by mapping the active Cdx1 response element (CRE) and Gsc response element (GRE). Moreover, a point mutation within the CRE and GRE completely abolished the activator and repressive activities of Cdx1 and Gsc, respectively. Furthermore, the chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the direct binding of Cdx1 and Gsc to the CRE and GRE, respectively. Inhibition of Cdx1 and Gsc activities at their respective functional regions, namely, the ventral marginal zone and dorsal marginal zone, reversed their effects on ventx3.2 transcription. These results indicate that Cdx1 and Gsc modulate ventx3.2 transcription in the ventral marginal zone and dorsal marginal zone by directly binding to the promoter region during Xenopus gastrulation.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to investigate the change and pathological significance of glycogen content in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral submucous fibrosis (OSF).
Methods and materials
13 normal oral mucosa (NOM), 12 OSF mucosa, and 35 pairs of OSCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent mucosa tissues (AT) were collected from Xiangya Hospital for PAS staining to detect glycogen. Transcriptome sequencing data from OSCC were used to compare glycogen metabolism gene expression differences. Kaplan–Meier method was conducted to estimate Recurrence-free survival (RFS).
Results
Glycogen levels were lower in OSF than in NOM and lower in OSCC than in AT. Transcriptome sequencing data analysis showed the expression of most glycogenolysis genes was increased and the expression of glycogen synthesis genes including PPP1R3C and GBE1 was decreased in OSCC tissues. High glycogen level was correlated with poor prognosis in OSCC patients under the background of OSF.
Conclusion
Glycogen may be used as a potential diagnostic biomolecule for OSF and OSCC, as well as a potential prognostic factor for OSCC in the context of OSF.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial cristae, infoldings of the mitochondrial inner membrane, undergo aberrant changes in their architecture with age. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to brain aging are largely elusive. Here, we observe an age-dependent accumulation of Glu-5′tsRNA-CTC, a transfer-RNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), derived from nuclear-encoded tRNAGlu in the mitochondria of glutaminergic neurons. Mitochondrial Glu-5′tsRNA-CTC disrupts the binding of mt-tRNALeu and leucyl-tRNA synthetase2 (LaRs2), impairing mt-tRNALeu aminoacylation and mitochondria-encoded protein translation. Mitochondrial translation defects disrupt cristae organization, leading to damaged glutaminase (GLS)-dependent glutamate formation and reduced synaptosomal glutamate levels. Moreover, reduction of Glu-5′tsRNA-CTC protects aged brains from age-related defects in mitochondrial cristae organization, glutamate metabolism, synaptic structures, and memory. Thus, beyond illustrating a physiological role for normal mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure in maintaining glutamate levels, our study defines a pathological role for tsRNAs in brain aging and age-related memory decline.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is restricted in metabolic nutrients including the semi-essential amino acid arginine. While complete arginine deprivation causes T cell dysfunction, it remains unclear how arginine levels fluctuate in the TME to shape T cell fates. Here, we find that the 20-μM low arginine condition, representing the levels found in the plasma of patients with cancers, confers Treg-like immunosuppressive capacities upon activated T cells. In vivo mouse tumor models and human single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets reveal positive correlations between low arginine condition and intratumoral Treg accumulation. Mechanistically, low arginine-activated T cells engage in metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming, using the ATF4-SLC7A11-GSH axis, to preserve their suppressive function. These findings improve our understanding of the role of arginine in human T cell biology with potential applications for immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders cause loss of neurites (axons and dendrites) in addition to neuronal death. Neurite loss may result directly from a primary insult, secondary to parental neuron death, or secondary to a post-injury inflammatory response. Here, we use lipopolysaccharide and the alarmin S100β to selectively evaluate neurite loss caused by the inflammatory response. Activation of microglia and infiltrating macrophages by these stimuli causes neurite loss that far exceeds neuronal death, both in vitro and in vivo. Neurite loss is accompanied by the formation of cofilactin rods and aggregates (CARs), which are polymers of cofilin-1 and actin induced by oxidative stress and other factors. Mice deficient in either cofilin-1 or the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase-2 show reduced CAR formation, neurite loss, and motor impairment. The findings identify a mechanism by which inflammation leads to neurite loss via CAR formation and highlight the relevance of neurite loss to functional impairment.

Abstract: Summary
The human WDR33 gene encodes three major isoforms. The canonical isoform WDR33v1 (V1) is a well-characterized nuclear mRNA polyadenylation factor, while the other two, WDR33v2 (V2) and WDR33v3 (V3), have not been studied. Here, we report that V2 and V3 are generated by alternative polyadenylation, and neither protein contains all seven WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeats that characterize V1. Surprisingly, V2 and V3 are not polyadenylation factors but localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and interact with stimulator of interferon genes (STING), the immune factor that induces the cellular response to cytosolic double-stranded DNA. V2 suppresses interferon-β induction by preventing STING disulfide oligomerization but promotes autophagy, likely by recruiting WIPI2 isoforms. V3, on the other hand, functions to increase STING protein levels. Our study has not only provided mechanistic insights into STING regulation but also revealed that protein isoforms can be functionally completely unrelated, indicating that alternative mRNA processing is a more powerful mechanism than previously appreciated.

Abstract: Summary
The granular retrosplenial cortex (gRSC) exhibits high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; ∼150 Hz), which can be driven by a hippocampus-subiculum pathway. How the cellular-synaptic and laminar organization of gRSC facilitates HFOs is unknown. Here, we probe gRSC HFO generation and coupling with hippocampal rhythms using focal optogenetics and silicon-probe recordings in behaving mice. ChR2-mediated excitation of CaMKII-expressing cells in L2/3 or L5 induces HFOs, but spontaneous HFOs are found only in L2/3, where HFO power is highest. HFOs couple to CA1 sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) during rest and the descending phase of theta. gRSC HFO current sources and sinks are the same for events during both SPW-Rs and theta oscillations. Independent component analysis shows that high gamma (50–100 Hz) in CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare is comodulated with HFO power. HFOs may thus facilitate interregional communication of a multisynaptic loop between the gRSC, hippocampus, and medial entorhinal cortex during distinct brain and behavioral states.

Abstract: Summary
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a member of the genus Dependoparvovirus, which infects a wide range of vertebrate species. Here, we observe that, unlike most primate AAV isolates, avian AAV is transcriptionally silenced in human cells. By swapping the VP1 N terminus from primate AAVs (e.g., AAV8) onto non-mammalian isolates (e.g., avian AAV), we identify a minimal component of the AAV capsid that controls viral transcription and unlocks robust transduction in both human cells and mouse tissue. This effect is accompanied by increased AAV genome chromatin accessibility and altered histone methylation. Proximity ligation analysis reveals that host factors are selectively recruited by the VP1 N terminus of AAV8 but not avian AAV. Notably, these include AAV essential factors implicated in the nuclear factor κB pathway, chromatin condensation, and histone methylation. We postulate that the AAV capsid has evolved mechanisms to recruit host factors to its genome, allowing transcriptional activation in a species-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
The nature of spinal output pathways that convey nociceptive information to the brain has been the subject of controversy. Here, we provide anatomical, molecular, and functional characterizations of two distinct anterolateral pathways: one, ascending in the lateral spinal cord, triggers nociceptive behaviors, and the other one, ascending in the ventral spinal cord, when inhibited, leads to sensorimotor deficits. Moreover, the lateral pathway consists of at least two subtypes. The first is a contralateral pathway that extends to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and thalamus; the second is a bilateral pathway that projects to the bilateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Finally, we present evidence showing that activation of the contralateral pathway is sufficient for defensive behaviors such as running and freezing, whereas the bilateral pathway is sufficient for attending behaviors such as licking and guarding. This work offers insight into the complex organizational logic of the anterolateral system in the mouse.

Abstract: Summary
The KCNT1 gene encodes the sodium-activated potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, KNa1.1), a regulator of neuronal excitability. Gain-of-function mutations in humans cause cortical network hyperexcitability, seizures, and severe intellectual disability. Using a mouse model expressing the Slack-R455H mutation, we find that Na+-dependent K+ (KNa) and voltage-dependent sodium (NaV) currents are increased in both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. These increased currents, however, enhance the firing of excitability neurons but suppress that of inhibitory neurons. We further show that the expression of NaV channel subunits, particularly that of NaV1.6, is upregulated and that the length of the axon initial segment and of axonal NaV immunostaining is increased in both neuron types. Our study on the coordinate regulation of KNa currents and the expression of NaV channels may provide an avenue for understanding and treating epilepsies and other neurological disorders.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the influence of Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold's discovery of the embryonic organizer on society outside the narrower confines of embryology. It begins by overviewing how in the 1920s–1930s, the organizer discovery fit well into the agenda of both right-wing and left-wing political camps, as it supported holistic theories of biological development that aligned with their ideological views. The paper then explores the organizer's influence on the formation and interdisciplinary discussions of the 1930s Cambridge Theoretical Biology Club. Club member C.H. Waddington's concept of the epigenetic landscape, inspired in part by Spemann and Mangold's work, went on to impact diverse fields including mathematics, psychology, anthropology, architecture, and art. Examples include mathematician René Thom's catastrophe landscapes and the field of ekistics (the science of human settlements). Spemann and Mangold's creation of an embryo chimera by combining tissues from different newt species also helped shape philosophers' and artists' understanding of the relationship between nature and technology as an integrated whole rather than separate entities. Additionally, Spemann's embryonic field concept helped influence field theories in other areas of science, and thinkers have pointed out metaphorical similarities between the organizer experiment and philosophical dialectics, film editing, or historical events. However, several factors likely limited the long-term societal impact of Spemann's holistic perspective, notably the rise of molecular biology and DNA-centric reductionist views of biology in the mid-late 20th century. While such reductionism still dominates public perceptions of biology, there seems to be a renewed openness to holistic perspectives reminiscent of Spemann's views.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence can exert dual effects in tumors, either suppressing or promoting tumor progression. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), released by senescent cells, plays a crucial role in this dichotomy. Consequently, the clinical challenge lies in developing therapies that safely enhance senescence in cancer, favoring tumor-suppressive SASP factors over tumor-promoting ones. Here, we identify the retinoic-acid-receptor (RAR) agonist adapalene as an effective pro-senescence compound in prostate cancer (PCa). Reactivation of RARs triggers a robust senescence response and a tumor-suppressive SASP. In preclinical mouse models of PCa, the combination of adapalene and docetaxel promotes a tumor-suppressive SASP that enhances natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor clearance more effectively than either agent alone. This approach increases the efficacy of the allogenic infusion of human NK cells in mice injected with human PCa cells, suggesting an alternative therapeutic strategy to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response in "immunologically cold" tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Reproduction is an energy-intensive process requiring systemic coordination. However, the inter-organ signaling mechanisms that relay nutrient status to modulate reproductive output are poorly understood. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to establish the integrated stress response (ISR) transcription factor, Atf4, as a fat tissue metabolic sensor that instructs oogenesis. We demonstrate that Atf4 regulates lipase activity to mediate yolk lipoprotein synthesis in the fat body. Depletion of Atf4 in the fat body also blunts oogenesis recovery after amino acid deprivation and re-feeding, suggestive of a nutrient-sensing role for Atf4. We also discovered that Atf4 promotes secretion of a fat-body-derived neuropeptide, CNMamide, which modulates neural circuits that promote egg-laying behavior (ovulation). Thus, we posit that ISR signaling in fat tissue acts as a “metabolic sensor” that instructs female reproduction—directly by impacting yolk lipoprotein production and follicle maturation and systemically by regulating ovulation.

Abstract: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic myelopoietic growth factor and proinflammatory cytokine, clinically used for multiple indications and serving as a promising target for treatment of many disorders, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, COVID-19. We have previously shown that dimeric Ca2+-bound forms of S100A6 and S100P proteins, members of the multifunctional S100 protein family, are specific to GM-CSF. To probe selectivity of these interactions, the affinity of recombinant human GM-CSF to dimeric Ca2+-loaded forms of 18 recombinant human S100 proteins was studied by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Of them, only S100A4 protein specifically binds to GM-CSF with equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, values of 0.3–2 μM, as confirmed by intrinsic fluorescence and chemical crosslinking data. Calcium removal prevents S100A4 binding to GM-CSF, whereas monomerization of S100A4/A6/P proteins disrupts S100A4/A6 interaction with GM-CSF and induces a slight decrease in S100P affinity for GM-CSF. Structural modelling indicates the presence in the GM-CSF molecule of a conserved S100A4/A6/P-binding site, consisting of the residues from its termini, helices I and III, some of which are involved in the interaction with GM-CSF receptors. The predicted involvement of the ‘hinge’ region and F89 residue of S100P in GM-CSF recognition was confirmed by mutagenesis. Examination of S100A4/A6/P ability to affect GM-CSF signaling showed that S100A4/A6 inhibit GM-CSF-induced suppression of viability of monocytic THP-1 cells. The ability of the S100 proteins to modulate GM-CSF activity is relevant to progression of various neoplasms and other diseases, according to bioinformatics analysis. The direct regulation of GM-CSF signaling by extracellular forms of the S100 proteins should be taken into account in the clinical use of GM-CSF and development of the therapeutic interventions targeting GM-CSF or its receptors.

Abstract: Telomerase is present in cells with numerous or even un-limited replicative cycles, and some studies suggest it is a stemness marker. In order to determine whether this is the case for the human hair bulbs, an immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study has been carried out using antibodies against telomerase and PCNA (a cell proliferation marker). The observed labeling is similar for the two antibodies here utilized and is mainly nuclear. More frequent telomerase-positive cells are seen in the matrix epithelium of anagen hair bulbs but sparse labeled cells are also seen in the outer root sheath. In late catagen and also in telogen hair follicles only sparse labeled cells are present in the outer root sheath and few cells also in the secondary germinal epithelium formed at the base of the hair bulb in telogen. Electron microscopic immunogold shows a prevalent nuclear distribution and a lower cytoplasmic distribution in sparse cells of anagen bulb matrix that contain few keratin bundles. The nuclear localization is generally seen over the euchromatin or in areas occupied by more compact chromatin that may indicate an activity of telomerase in chromatin assemblage or dis-assemblage. The study concludes that the localization of telomerase is present in cells undergoing proliferation, namely transit amplifying cells of the outer root sheath that are sparsely detected in the lowermost secondary germinal hair bulb also in telogen.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is often associated with aging. However, the mechanism of age-related obesity is unknown. The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) mediates leptin-melanocortin anti-obesity signaling in the hypothalamus. Here, we discovered that MC4R-bearing primary cilia of hypothalamic neurons progressively shorten with age in rats, correlating with age-dependent metabolic decline and increased adiposity. This “age-related ciliopathy” is promoted by overnutrition-induced upregulation of leptin-melanocortin signaling and inhibited or reversed by dietary restriction or the knockdown of ciliogenesis-associated kinase 1 (CILK1). Forced shortening of MC4R-bearing cilia in hypothalamic neurons by genetic approaches impaired neuronal sensitivity to melanocortin and resulted in decreased brown fat thermogenesis and energy expenditure and increased appetite, finally developing obesity and leptin resistance. Therefore, despite its acute anti-obesity effect, chronic leptin-melanocortin signaling increases susceptibility to obesity by promoting the age-related shortening of MC4R-bearing cilia. This study provides a crucial mechanism for age-related obesity, which increases the risk of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil-derived bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is known for its bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria and neutralization of lipopolysaccharide. Here, we define BPI as a potent activator of murine dendritic cells (DCs). As shown in GM-CSF-cultured, bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), BPI induces a distinct stimulation profile including IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor expression. Conventional DCs also respond to BPI, while M-CSF-cultivated or peritoneal lavage macrophages do not. Subsequent to BPI stimulation of BMDCs, CD4+ T cells predominantly secrete IL-22 and, when naive, preferentially differentiate into T helper 22 (Th22) cells. Congruent with the tissue-protective properties of IL-22 and along with impaired IL-22 induction, disease severity is significantly increased during dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in BPI-deficient mice. Importantly, physiological diversification of intestinal microbiota fosters BPI-dependent IL-22 induction in CD4+ T cells derived from mesenteric lymph nodes. In conclusion, BPI is a potent activator of DCs and consecutive Th22 cell differentiation with substantial relevance in intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Condensin shapes mitotic chromosomes by folding chromatin into loops, but whether it does so by DNA-loop extrusion remains speculative. Although loop-extruding cohesin is stalled by transcription, the impact of transcription on condensin, which is enriched at highly expressed genes in many species, remains unclear. Using degrons of Rpb1 or the torpedo nuclease Dhp1XRN2 to either deplete or displace RNAPII on chromatin in fission yeast metaphase cells, we show that RNAPII does not load condensin on DNA. Instead, RNAPII retains condensin in cis and hinders its ability to fold mitotic chromatin and to support chromosome segregation, consistent with the stalling of a loop extruder. Transcription termination by Dhp1 limits such a hindrance. Our results shed light on the integrated functioning of condensin, and we argue that a tight control of transcription underlies mitotic chromosome assembly by loop-extruding condensin.

Abstract: The Notch signaling pathway, an evolutionarily highly conserved pathway, participates in various essential physiological processes in organisms. Activation of Notch signaling in the canonical manner requires the combination of ligand and receptor. There are two ligands of Notch in Drosophila: Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser). A mutation mf157 is identified for causing nicks of fly wings in genetic analysis from a mutant library (unpublished) that was established previously. Immunofluorescent staining illustrates that mf157 represses the expression of Cut and Wingless (Wg), the targets of Notch signaling. MARCM cloning analysis reveals that mf157 functions at the same level or the upstream of ligands of Notch in signaling sending cells. Sequencing demonstrates that mf157 is a novel allele of the Ser gene. Subsequently, mf553 and mf167 are also identified as new alleles of Ser from our library. Furthermore, the complementary assays and the examination of transcripts confirm the sequencing results. Besides, the repressed phenotypes of Notch signaling were reverted by transposon excision experiments of mf157. In conclusion, we identify three fresh alleles of Ser. Our works supply additional genetic resources for further study of functions of Ser and Notch signaling regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are endogenous arachidonic acid metabolites, modulating diverse physiological processes including inflammation and cardiovascular homeostasis through activating PGF2α receptor (FP) and TXA2 receptor (TP). Ligands targeting FP and TP have demonstrated efficacy in treating conditions like glaucoma and cardiovascular diseases in humans, as well as reproductive-related diseases in animals. Here, we present five cryoelectron microscopy structures illustrating FP and TP in complex with Gq and bound to PGF2α (endogenous ligand), latanoprost acid (a clinical drug), and two other synthetic agonists. Combined with mutational and functional studies, these structures reveal not only structural features for the specific recognition of endogenous ligands and attainment of receptor selectivity of FP and TP but also the common mechanisms of receptor activation and Gq protein coupling. The findings may enrich our knowledge of ligand recognition and signal transduction of the prostanoid receptor family and facilitate rational ligand design toward these two receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Endocrine cells employ regulated exocytosis of secretory granules to secrete hormones and neurotransmitters. Secretory granule exocytosis depends on spatiotemporal variables such as proximity to the plasma membrane and age, with newly generated granules being preferentially released. Despite recent advances, we lack a comprehensive view of the molecular composition of insulin granules and associated changes over their lifetime. Here, we report a strategy for the purification of insulin secretory granules of distinct age from insulinoma INS-1 cells. Tagging the granule-resident protein phogrin with a cleavable CLIP tag, we obtain intact fractions of age-distinct granules for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. We find that the lipid composition changes over time, along with the physical properties of the membrane, and that kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5b) as well as Ras-related protein 3a (RAB3a) associate preferentially with younger granules. Further, we identify the Rho GTPase-activating protein (ARHGAP1) as a cytosolic factor associated with insulin granules.

Abstract: Background
Ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for colorectal carcinoma. Different mechanisms are related to colitis like apoptosis and hyperproliferation. Moringa oleifera leaves extract (MO) provides a promising option to overcome the risk.
Purpose
To examine the colonic changes in a rat model of colitis induced by sodium nitrate (SN) and study the effects of MO.
Study design
Eight adult male rats were allocated in each of the three group; control (distilled water), SN (100 mg/kg/day, orally via gastric gavage), and SN + MO (100 mg/kg/day, orally via gastric gavage).
Methods
Body weight was measured after the end of the experiment. Colonic homogenates were tested for levels of oxidative stress indicators. Immunohistochemistry for P53, PCNA and Ki-67 was performed. Fresh colon specimens were used for quantitative real-time PCR for assessment of P53, PCNA and Ki-67 gene expression.
Results
SN group revealed a significant decreased weight (p = 0.002). MDA and NO levels were higher with SN administration than with MO co-administration (p= 0.04, 0.01 respectively). GSH level was reduced in SN group (p = 0.02) and significantly increased with MO intake (p = 0.04). SN-induced colonic destructive changes were reversed with MO. P53, PCNA and Ki-67 levels of gene expression were reduced in SN + MO group than SN group (P = 0.007, 0.02, 0.001 respectively).
Conclusion
MO protected the colonic mucosa against SN-induced changes regulating apoptosis, and cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) are an invaluable source of information for drug target development because they provide genetic evidence to support protein function, suggest relationships between cis- and trans-associated proteins, and link proteins to disease endpoints. Using Olink proteomics data for 1,463 proteins measured in over 54,000 samples of the UK Biobank, we identified 4,248 associations with 2,821 ratios between protein levels (rQTLs). rQTLs were 7.6-fold enriched in known protein-protein interactions, suggesting that their ratios reflect biological links between the implicated proteins. Conducting a GWAS on ratios increased the number of discovered genetic signals by 24.7%. The approach can identify novel loci of clinical relevance, support causal gene identification, and reveal complex networks of interacting proteins. Taken together, our study adds significant value to the genetic insights that can be derived from the UKB proteomics data and motivates the wider use of ratios in large-scale GWAS.

Abstract: The discovery of the amphibian gastrula organizer and its publication by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold in 1924 is a foundation of experimental embryology, and has shaped our understanding of embryonic induction and pattern formation in vertebrates until today. The original publication is a piece of scientific art, characterized by the meticulous hand drawings by Hilde Mangold, as well as the text that develops mechanistic concepts of modern embryology. While historic microphotographs of specimens got lost, the original microscope slides and Hilde Mangold's laboratory notebook have been secured in embryological collections until today. Here, we make the original data of the six embryonic specimens reported in 1924, as well as the laboratory notebook, available in an accessible digital format. Together, these data shed light on the scientific process that led to the discovery, and should help to make the experiments on the most important signalling center in early vertebrate development transparent for generations of embryologists to come.

Abstract: Previous data indicated that nicotine could modulate the immune regulatory potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Currently, we intend to assess the effects of a conditioned medium of nicotine-pulsed mesenchymal stem cells in the experimental model of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Bone marrow-derived MSCs pulsed with 0,.1,.5, or 1 μM nicotine until the cells reached 90% confluency. Correspondent to in vitro results, the least effective concentration of nicotine that led to an anti-inflammatory environment by the MSC-conditioned medium was 0.5 μM. The murine model of AIH induced by Intravenous injection Concanavalin A (ConA). Mice were allocated to pretreatment (Concomitant treatment with ConA administration) or treatment groups and received un-pulsed MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or conditioned medium of nicotine (0.5 µM)-pulsed MSCs (CMN). The levels of ALT, AST, MPO, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 were the highest in the ConA group than in the other groups. Pretreatment or treatment with the CMN caused a significant reduction in hepatic enzymes and inflammatory cytokines compared to pretreatment or treatment with CM. Both CM or CMN significantly decreased the numbers of activated TCD4+ and TCD8+ in the blood. More importantly, pre-treatment or treatment with CMN caused a better improvement in the histopathological appearance than pre-treatment or treatment with CM. The results of this study show that CMN rapidly controls the AIH mouse model, and therefore it may be considered as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of AIH patients.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is underpinned by pronounced metabolic decline; however, the drivers remain obscure. Here, we report that IgG accumulates during aging, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT), to impair adipose tissue function and metabolic health. Caloric restriction (CR) decreases IgG accumulation in WAT, whereas replenishing IgG counteracts CR’s metabolic benefits. IgG activates macrophages via Ras signaling and consequently induces fibrosis in WAT through the TGF-β/SMAD pathway. Consistently, B cell null mice are protected from aging-associated WAT fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance, unless exposed to IgG. Conditional ablation of the IgG recycling receptor, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in macrophages prevents IgG accumulation in aging, resulting in prolonged healthspan and lifespan. Further, targeting FcRn by antisense oligonucleotide restores WAT integrity and metabolic health in aged mice. These findings pinpoint IgG as a hidden culprit in aging and enlighten a novel strategy to rejuvenate metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
Iron overload is closely associated with metabolic dysfunction. However, the role of iron in the hypothalamus remains unclear. Here, we find that hypothalamic iron levels are increased, particularly in agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in high-fat-diet-fed mice. Using pharmacological or genetic approaches, we reduce iron overload in AgRP neurons by central deferoxamine administration or transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc) deletion, ameliorating diet-induced obesity and related metabolic dysfunction. Conversely, Tfrc-mediated iron overload in AgRP neurons leads to overeating and adiposity. Mechanistically, the reduction of iron overload in AgRP neurons inhibits AgRP neuron activity; improves insulin and leptin sensitivity; and inhibits iron-induced oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nuclear factor κB signaling, and suppression of cytokine signaling 3 expression. These results highlight the critical role of hypothalamic iron in obesity development and suggest targets for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
We examined the distribution of pre-synaptic contacts in axons of mouse neurons and constructed whole-brain single-cell neuronal networks using an extensive dataset of 1,891 fully reconstructed neurons. We found that bouton locations were not homogeneous throughout the axon and among brain regions. As our algorithm was able to generate whole-brain single-cell connectivity matrices from full morphology reconstruction datasets, we further found that non-homogeneous bouton locations have a significant impact on network wiring, including degree distribution, triad census, and community structure. By perturbing neuronal morphology, we further explored the link between anatomical details and network topology. In our in silico exploration, we found that dendritic and axonal tree span would have the greatest impact on network wiring, followed by synaptic contact deletion. Our results suggest that neuroanatomical details must be carefully addressed in studies of whole-brain networks at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Individual cell sensing of external cues has evolved through the temporal patterns in signaling. Since nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling dynamics have been examined using a single subunit, RelA, it remains unclear whether more information might be transmitted via other subunits. Using NF-κB double-knockin reporter mice, we monitored both canonical NF-κB subunits, RelA and c-Rel, simultaneously in single macrophages by quantitative live-cell imaging. We show that signaling features of RelA and c-Rel convey more information about the stimuli than those of either subunit alone. Machine learning is used to predict the ligand identity accurately based on RelA and c-Rel signaling features without considering the co-activated factors. Ligand discrimination is achieved through selective non-redundancy of RelA and c-Rel signaling dynamics, as well as their temporal coordination. These results suggest a potential role of c-Rel in fine-tuning immune responses and highlight the need for approaches that will elucidate the mechanisms regulating NF-κB subunit specificity.

Abstract: This article focuses on the roots of the organizer concept, which was developed by Hans Spemann during his studies of early embryonic development in amphibians. The fundamental properties of this axis-inducing signaling center have been elucidated through pioneering molecular research by Eddy De Robertis' laboratory and other researchers. Evolutionary comparisons have disclosed the presence of this signaling center, involving the interaction of Wnt and TGF-beta signaling pathways, existed not only in vertebrates but also in basal Metazoa such as Cnidaria. – Notably, even prior to the groundbreaking experiments conducted by Hilde Mangold and Hans Spemann, Ethel Browne conducted similar transplantation experiments on Hydra polyps. They were performed under the guidance of Thomas H Morgan and in the laboratory of Edmund B Wilson. Howard Lenhoff was the first to draw connections between Ethel Browne's transplantation experiments and those of Spemann and Mangold, igniting a vivid debate on the precedence of the organizer concept and its recognition in Nobel Prize considerations. This review critically compares the experiments conducted by Spemann and Mangold with those preceding their seminal work, concluding that the organizer concept clearly builds upon earlier research aimed at understanding developmental gradients, such as in the simple model Hydra. However, these approaches were not pursued further by Morgan, who shifted his focus towards unraveling the genetic control of development in flies, an approach that ultimately revealed the molecular identity of the Spemann organizer in vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNA (miRNA) maturation is critically dependent on structural features of primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). However, the scarcity of determined pri-miRNA structures has limited our understanding of miRNA maturation. Here, we employed selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP), a high-throughput RNA structure probing method, to unravel the secondary structures of 476 high-confidence human pri-miRNAs. Our SHAPE-based structures diverge substantially from those inferred solely from computation, particularly in the apical loop and basal segments, underlining the need for experimental data in RNA structure prediction. By comparing the structures with high-throughput processing data, we determined the optimal structural features of pri-miRNAs. The sequence determinants are influenced substantially by their structural contexts. Moreover, we identified an element termed the bulged GWG motif (bGWG) with a 3′ bulge in the lower stem, which promotes processing. Our structure-function mapping better annotates the determinants of pri-miRNA processing and offers practical implications for designing small hairpin RNAs and predicting the impacts of miRNA mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-37 (IL-37) has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in various cancer types. However, the immune regulatory function of IL-37 in the tumor microenvironment is unclear. Here, we established a human leukocyte antigen-I (HLA-I)-matched humanized patient-derived xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model and three murine orthotopic HCC models to study the function of IL-37 in the tumor microenvironment. We found that IL-37 inhibited HCC growth and promoted T cell activation. Further study revealed that IL-37 impaired the immunosuppressive capacity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Pretreatment of MDSCs with IL-37 before adoptive transfer attenuated their tumor-promoting function in HCC tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, IL-37 promoted both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in MDSCs, resulting in the upregulation of ATP release, which impaired the immunosuppressive capacity of MDSCs. Collectively, we demonstrated that IL-37 inhibited tumor development through dampening MDSCs’ immunosuppressive capacity in the tumor microenvironment via metabolic reprogramming, making it a promising target for future cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal principal neurons display both spatial tuning properties and memory features. Whether this distinction corresponds to separate neuron types or a context-dependent continuum has been debated. We report here that the task-context (“splitter”) feature is highly variable along both trial and spatial position axes. Neurons acquire or lose splitter features across trials even when place field features remain unaltered. Multiple place fields of the same neuron can individually encode both past or future run trajectories, implying that splitter fields are under the control of assembly activity. Place fields can be differentiated into subfields by the behavioral choice of the animal, and splitting within subfields evolves across trials. Interneurons also differentiate choices by integrating inputs from pyramidal cells. Finally, bilateral optogenetic inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex reversibly decreases the fraction of splitter fields. Our findings suggest that place or splitter features are different manifestations of the same hippocampal computation.

Abstract: Summary
Ovarian endometriosis is characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue within the ovary, causing infertility and chronic pain. However, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Utilizing high-precision single-cell RNA sequencing, we profile the normal, eutopic, and ectopic endometrium from 34 individuals across proliferative and secretory phases. We observe an increased proportion of ciliated cells in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium, characterized by a diminished expression of estrogen sulfotransferase, which likely confers apoptosis resistance. After translocating to ectopic lesions, endometrial epithelium upregulates nicotinamide N-methyltransferase expression that inhibits apoptosis by promoting deacetylation and subsequent nuclear exclusion of transcription factor forkhead box protein O1, thereby leading to the downregulation of the apoptotic gene BIM. Moreover, epithelial cells in ectopic lesions elevate HLA class II complex expression, which stimulates CD4+ T cells and consequently contributes to chronic inflammation. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive atlas of ovarian endometriosis and highlights potential therapeutic targets for modulating apoptosis and inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Most eukaryotic proteins are degraded by the 26S proteasome after modification with a polyubiquitin chain. Substrates lacking unstructured segments cannot be degraded directly and require prior unfolding by the Cdc48 ATPase (p97 or VCP in mammals) in complex with its ubiquitin-binding partner Ufd1-Npl4 (UN). Here, we use purified yeast components to reconstitute Cdc48-dependent degradation of well-folded model substrates by the proteasome. We show that a minimal system consists of the 26S proteasome, the Cdc48-UN ATPase complex, the proteasome cofactor Rad23, and the Cdc48 cofactors Ubx5 and Shp1. Rad23 and Ubx5 stimulate polyubiquitin binding to the 26S proteasome and the Cdc48-UN complex, respectively, allowing these machines to compete for substrates before and after their unfolding. Shp1 stimulates protein unfolding by the Cdc48-UN complex rather than substrate recruitment. Experiments in yeast cells confirm that many proteins undergo bidirectional substrate shuttling between the 26S proteasome and Cdc48 ATPase before being degraded.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic progression of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) remains poorly understood and poses significant challenges for treatment. To overcome these challenges, we performed multiomics analyses of primary CRC and liver metastases. Genomic alterations, such as structural variants or copy number alterations, were enriched in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and increased in metastases. Unsupervised mass spectrometry-based proteomics of 135 primary and 123 metastatic CRCs uncovered distinct proteomic subtypes, three each for primary and metastatic CRCs, respectively. Integrated analyses revealed that hypoxia, stemness, and immune signatures characterize these 6 subtypes. Hypoxic CRC harbors high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features and metabolic adaptation. CRC with a stemness signature shows high oncogenic pathway activation and alternative telomere lengthening (ALT) phenotype, especially in metastatic lesions. Tumor microenvironment analysis shows immune evasion via modulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/II and antigen processing pathways. This study characterizes both primary and metastatic CRCs and provides a large proteogenomics dataset of metastatic progression.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphomannomutase 2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of the PMM2 enzyme, which leads to impaired protein glycosylation. While the disorder presents with primarily neurological symptoms, there is limited knowledge about the specific brain-related changes caused by PMM2 deficiency. Here, we demonstrate aberrant neural activity in 2D neuronal networks from PMM2-CDG individuals. Utilizing multi-omics datasets from 3D human cortical organoids (hCOs) derived from PMM2-CDG individuals, we identify widespread decreases in protein glycosylation, highlighting impaired glycosylation as a key pathological feature of PMM2-CDG, as well as impaired mitochondrial structure and abnormal glucose metabolism in PMM2-deficient hCOs, indicating disturbances in energy metabolism. Correlation between PMM2 enzymatic activity in hCOs and symptom severity suggests that the level of PMM2 enzyme function directly influences neurological manifestations. These findings enhance our understanding of specific brain-related perturbations associated with PMM2-CDG, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential directions for therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of CD4 T cells during chronic infections is vital for limiting pathogen burden and disease recrudescence. Although inhibitory receptor expression by CD4 T cells is commonly associated with immune suppression and exhaustion, such cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control activation are also associated with cell survival. Using a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), we discovered a subset of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3)-expressing CD4 T cells that co-express CXCR5. Although LAG3+CXCR5+ CD4 T cells are present in naive mice, they expand during VL. These cells express gene signatures associated with self-renewal capacity, suggesting progenitor-like properties. When transferred into Rag1−/− mice, these LAG3+CXCR5+ CD4 T cells differentiated into multiple effector types upon Leishmania donovani infection. The transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma-6 was partially required for their maintenance. Altogether, we propose that the LAG3+CXCR5+ CD4 T cell subset could play a role in maintaining CD4 T cell responses during persistent infections.

Abstract: Summary
J-domain proteins (JDPs) constitute a large family of molecular chaperones that bind a broad spectrum of substrates, targeting them to Hsp70, thus determining the specificity of and activating the entire chaperone functional cycle. The malfunction of JDPs is therefore inextricably linked to myriad human disorders. Here, we uncover a unique mechanism by which chaperones recognize misfolded clients, present in human class A JDPs. Through a newly identified β-hairpin site, these chaperones detect changes in protein dynamics at the initial stages of misfolding, prior to exposure of hydrophobic regions or large structural rearrangements. The JDPs then sequester misfolding-prone proteins into large oligomeric assemblies, protecting them from aggregation. Through this mechanism, class A JDPs bind destabilized p53 mutants, preventing clearance of these oncoproteins by Hsp70-mediated degradation, thus promoting cancer progression. Removal of the β-hairpin abrogates this protective activity while minimally affecting other chaperoning functions. This suggests the class A JDP β-hairpin as a highly specific target for cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Engrams, or the physical substrate of memory, recruit heterogeneous cell types. Targeted reactivation of neurons processing discrete memories drives the behavioral expression of memory, though the underlying landscape of recruited cells and their real-time responses remain elusive. To understand how artificial stimulation of fear affects intra-hippocampal neuron-astrocyte dynamics as well as their behavioral consequences, we express channelrhodopsin-2 in an activity-dependent manner within dentate gyrus neurons while recording both cell types with fiber photometry in hippocampal ventral CA1 across learning and memory. Both cell types exhibit shock responsiveness, with astrocytic calcium events uniquely modulated by fear conditioning. Optogenetic stimulation of a hippocampus-mediated engram recapitulates coordinated calcium signatures time locked to freezing, mirroring those observed during natural fear memory recall. Our findings reveal cell-type-specific dynamics in the hippocampus during freezing behavior, emphasizing neuronal-astrocytic coupling as a shared mechanism enabling both natural and artificially induced memory retrieval and the behavioral expression of fear.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuins are pro-longevity genes with chromatin modulation potential, but how these properties are connected is not well understood. Here, we generated a panel of isogeneic human stem cell lines with SIRT1–SIRT7 knockouts and found that any sirtuin deficiency leads to accelerated cellular senescence. Through large-scale epigenomic analyses, we show how sirtuin deficiency alters genome organization and that genomic regions sensitive to sirtuin deficiency are preferentially enriched in active enhancers, thereby promoting interactions within topologically associated domains and the formation of de novo enhancer-promoter loops. In all sirtuin-deficient human stem cell lines, we found that chromatin contacts are rewired to promote aberrant activation of the placenta-specific gene PAPPA, which controls the pro-senescence effects associated with sirtuin deficiency and serves as a potential aging biomarker. Based on our survey of the 3D chromatin architecture, we established connections between sirtuins and potential target genes, thereby informing the development of strategies for aging interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Topologically associated domains (TADs) are interaction subnetworks of chromosomal regions in 3D genomes. TAD boundaries frequently coincide with genome breaks while boundary deletion is under negative selection, suggesting that TADs may facilitate genome rearrangements and evolution. We show that genes co-localize by evolutionary age in humans and mice, resulting in TADs having different proportions of younger and older genes. We observe a major transition in the age co-localization patterns between the genes born during vertebrate whole-genome duplications (WGDs) or before and those born afterward. We also find that genes recently duplicated in primates and rodents are more frequently essential when they are located in old-enriched TADs and interact with genes that last duplicated during the WGD. Therefore, the evolutionary relevance of recent genes may increase when located in TADs with established regulatory networks. Our data suggest that TADs could play a role in organizing ancestral functions and evolutionary novelty.

Abstract: Summary
Batten disease, the most prevalent form of neurodegeneration in children, is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal transmembrane protein. CLN3 loss leads to significant accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs), the end products of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome. Despite GPD storage being robustly observed upon CLN3 loss, the role of GPDs in neuropathology remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GPDs act as potent inhibitors of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome using human cell lines and mouse models. Mechanistically, GPDs bind and competitively inhibit the lysosomal phospholipases PLA2G15 and PLBD2, which we establish to possess phospholipase B activity. GPDs effectively inhibit the rate-limiting lysophospholipase activity of these phospholipases. Consistently, lysosomes of CLN3-deficient cells and tissues accumulate toxic lysophospholipids. Our work establishes that the storage material in Batten disease directly disrupts lysosomal lipid homeostasis, suggesting GPD clearance as a potential therapeutic approach to this fatal disease.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the cell-type composition and spatial organization of brain regions is crucial for interpreting brain computation and function. In the thalamus, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are involved in a wide variety of functions, yet the cell-type composition of the ATN remains unmapped at a single-cell and spatial resolution. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization, we identify three discrete excitatory cell-type clusters that correspond to the known nuclei of the ATN and uncover marker genes, molecular pathways, and putative functions of these cell types. We further illustrate graded spatial variation along the dorsomedial-ventrolateral axis for all individual nuclei of the ATN and additionally demonstrate that the anteroventral nucleus exhibits spatially covarying protein products and long-range inputs. Collectively, our study reveals discrete and continuous cell-type organizational principles of the ATN, which will help to guide and interpret experiments on ATN computation and function.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to compose successive words into a meaningful phrase is a characteristic feature of human cognition, yet its neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the cortical mechanisms of semantic composition using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants read one-word, two-word, and five-word noun phrases and compared them with a subsequent image. Decoding of MEG signals revealed three processing stages. During phrase comprehension, the representation of individual words was sustained for a variable duration depending on phrasal context. During the delay period, the word code was replaced by a working-memory code whose activation increased with semantic complexity. Finally, the speed and accuracy of retrieval depended on semantic complexity and was faster for surface than for deep semantic properties. In conclusion, we propose that the brain initially encodes phrases using factorized dimensions for successive words but later compresses them in working memory and requires a period of decompression to access them.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the effects of tocilizumab (TCZ), epoetin beta (EPO), and their combination on nerve regeneration in a sciatic nerve injury model.
Materials and method
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into (-) negative control, sham, TCZ, EPO ((+) positive control), and TCZ+EPO groups. The TCZ group received TCZ (8 mg/kg intraperitoneal) immediately after surgery. On day 14th, the EPO group received EPO (5000 IU/kg, intraperitoneal); the TCZ+EPO group received TCZ (8 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), EPO (5000 IU/kg, intraperitoneal), and TCZ (8 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) post-surgery. Motor and sensory functions were assessed pre and post-surgery. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress parameters were evaluated biochemically in the serum, and sciatic nerve tissue was evaluated histopathologically using haematoxylin-Eosin and Masson trichrome staining.
Conclusions
TCZ and EPO decreased nerve injury effects by increasing motor and sensory conduction velocities of the sciatic nerve. Biochemically, TCZ and EPO significantly increased Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase, and Glutathione peroxidase 4 levels while decreasing Lipid Peroxidation levels (p=0.001). Histopathologically, neuronal degeneration following nerve injury was decreased in the groups receiving TCZ and EPO (p=0.001). EPO and TCZ attenuate the adverse effects of nerve injury. However, the TCZ+EPO treatment favoured biochemical activities over tissue and functional activities. This has been confirmed functionally, biochemically, and histopathologically.

Abstract: Summary
The interferon signaling pathway is critical for host defense by serving diverse functions in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we show that type I gamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase i5 (PIPKIγi5), an enzyme that synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2), controls the sensitivity to interferon in both human and mouse cells. PIPKIγi5 directly binds to the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which suppresses the STAT1 dimerization, IFN-γ-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation, and transcription of IFN-γ-responsive genes. Depletion of PIPKIγi5 significantly enhances IFN-γ signaling and strengthens an antiviral response. In addition, PIPKIγi5-synthesized PI4,5P2 can bind to STAT1 and promote the PIPKIγi5-STAT1 interaction. Similar to its interaction with STAT1, PIPKIγi5 is capable of interacting with other members of the STAT family, including STAT2 and STAT3, thereby suppressing the expression of genes mediated by these transcription factors. These findings identify the function of PIPKIγi5 in immune regulation.

Abstract: Background
Adiponectin (APN) has exhibited ameliorating effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study investigates the roles of APN and its regulatory molecules in hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and the progression of NAFLD.
Methods
Mice were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish NAFLD models. Liver tissue was examined for lipid metabolism, fibrosis, and inflammation. Mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) to mimic a high-fat environment. The conditioned medium (CM) from adipocytes was collected for the culture of isolated mouse HSCs. Gain- or loss-of-function studies of APN, nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2 (NR2F2), and STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 (STUB1) were performed to analyze their roles in NAFLD and HSC activation in vivo and in vitro.
Results
APN expression was poorly expressed in HFD-fed mice and PA-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was attributed to the transcription inhibition mediated by NR2F2. Silencing of NR2F2 restored the APN expression, ameliorating liver steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory cytokine infiltration in mouse livers and reducing HSC activation. Similarly, the NR2F2 silencing condition reduced HSC activation in vitro. However, these effects were counteracted by artificial APN silencing. STUB1 facilitated the ubiquitination and protein degradation of NR2F2, and its upregulation mitigated NAFLD-like symptoms in mice and HSC activation, effects reversed by the NR2F2 overexpression.
Conclusion
This study highlights the role of STUB1 in reducing HSC activation and alleviating NAFLD by attenuating NR2F2-mediated transcriptional repression of APN.

Abstract: Summary
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into myelin-producing cells and modulate neuronal activity. Defects in OPC development are associated with neurological diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) contributes to neural development; however, the mechanism by which m6A regulates OPC development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PRRC2B is an m6A reader that regulates OPC development and myelination. Nestin-Cre-mediated Prrc2b deletion affects neural stem cell self-renewal and glial differentiation. Moreover, the oligodendroglia lineage-specific deletion of Prrc2b reduces the numbers of OPCs and oligodendrocytes, causing hypomyelination and impaired motor coordination. Integrative methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, RNA sequencing, and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses identify Sox2 as the target of PRRC2B. Notably, PRRC2B, displaying separate and cooperative functions with PRRC2A, stabilizes mRNA by binding to m6A motifs in the coding sequence and 3′ UTR of Sox2. In summary, we identify the posttranscriptional regulation of PRRC2B in OPC development, extending the understanding of PRRC2 family proteins and providing a therapeutic target for myelin-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas immune systems provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against bacteriophages, but they are often transcriptionally repressed to mitigate auto-immunity. In some cases, CRISPR-Cas expression increases in response to a phage infection, but the mechanisms of induction are largely unknown, and it is unclear whether induction occurs strongly and quickly enough to benefit the bacterial host. In S. pyogenes, Cas9 is both an immune effector and auto-repressor of CRISPR-Cas expression. Here, we show that phage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins relieve Cas9 auto-repression and trigger a rapid increase in CRISPR-Cas levels during a single phage infective cycle. As a result, fewer cells succumb to lysis, leading to a striking survival benefit after multiple rounds of infection. CRISPR-Cas induction also reduces lysogeny, thereby limiting a route for horizontal gene transfer. Altogether, we show that Cas9 is not only a CRISPR-Cas effector and repressor but also a phage sensor that can mount an anti-anti-CRISPR transcriptional response.

Abstract: Summary
Monocytes can develop an exhausted memory state characterized by reduced differentiation, pathogenic inflammation, and immune suppression that drives immune dysregulation during sepsis. Chromatin alterations, notably via histone modifications, underlie innate immune memory, but the contribution of DNA methylation remains poorly understood. Using an ex vivo sepsis model, we show altered DNA methylation throughout the genome of exhausted monocytes, including genes implicated in immune dysregulation during sepsis and COVID-19 infection (e.g., Plac8). These changes are recapitulated in septic mice induced by cecal slurry injection. Methylation profiles developed in septic mice are maintained during ex vivo culture, supporting the involvement of DNA methylation in stable monocyte exhaustion memory. Methylome reprogramming is driven in part by Wnt signaling inhibition in exhausted monocytes and can be reversed with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, Wnt agonists, or immune training molecules. Our study demonstrates the significance of altered DNA methylation in the maintenance of stable monocyte exhaustion memory.

Abstract: Summary
The titer of viruses that persist and propagate in their insect vector must be high enough for transmission yet not harm the insect, but the mechanism of this dynamic balance is unclear. Here, expression of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (LsIMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) synthesis, is shown to be downregulated by increased levels of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on LsIMPDH mRNA in rice stripe virus (RSV)-infected small brown planthoppers (SBPHs; Laodelphax striatellus), the RSV vector, which decreases GTP content, thus limiting viral proliferation. Moreover, planthopper methyltransferase-like protein 3 (LsMETTL3) and m6A reader protein LsYTHDF3 are found to catalyze and recognize the m6A on LsIMPDH mRNA, respectively, and cooperate in destabilizing LsIMPDH transcripts. Co-silencing assays show that negative regulation of viral proliferation by both LsMETTL3 and LsYTHDF3 is partially dependent on LsIMPDH. This distinct mechanism limits virus replication in an insect vector, providing a potential gene target to block viral transmission.
