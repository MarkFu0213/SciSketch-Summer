Abstract: A diet containing a high n−3/n−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio has cardioprotective properties. PUFAs incorporation into membranes influences the function of membrane proteins. We investigated the impact of the membrane incorporation of PUFAs, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5 n−3), on the anti-atherogenic cholesterol efflux pathways. We used cholesteryl esters (CE)-loaded human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to mimic foam cells exposed to the FAs for a long period of time to ensure their incorporation into cellular membranes. Phospholipid fraction of EPA cells exhibited high levels of EPA and its elongation product docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (C22:5 n−3), which was associated with a decreased level of arachidonic acid (AA) (C20:4 n−6). EPA 70μM reduced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein (apo) AI by 30% without any alteration in ABCA1 expression. The other tested PUFAs, DPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6 n−3), and AA, were also able to reduce ABCA1 functionality while the monounsaturated oleic FA slightly decreased efflux and the saturated palmitic FA had no impact. Moreover, EPA also reduced cholesterol efflux to HDL mediated by the Cla-1 and ABCG1 pathways. EPA incorporation did not hinder efflux in free cholesterol-loaded HMDM and did not promote esterification of cholesterol. Conversely, EPA reduced the neutral hydrolysis of cytoplasmic CE by 24%. The reduced CE hydrolysis was likely attributed to the increase in cellular TG contents and/or the decrease in apo E secretion after EPA treatment. In conclusion, EPA membrane incorporation reduces cholesterol efflux in human foam cells by reducing the cholesteryl ester mobilization from lipid droplets.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with poor patient survival that is at least partly caused by malignant and therapy-resistant glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) that are protected in GSLC niches. Previously, we have shown that the chemo-attractant stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), its C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and the cysteine protease cathepsin K (CatK) are localized in GSLC niches in glioblastoma. Here, we investigated whether SDF-1α is a niche factor that through its interactions with CXCR4 and/or its second receptor CXCR7 on GSLCs facilitates their homing to niches. Furthermore, we aimed to prove that SDF-1α cleavage by CatK inactivates SDF-1α and inhibits the invasion of GSLCs. We performed mass spectrometric analysis of cleavage products of SDF-1α after proteolysis by CatK. We demonstrated that CatK cleaves SDF-1α at 3 sites in the N-terminus, which is the region of SDF-1α that binds to its receptors. Confocal imaging of human GBM tissue sections confirmed co-localization of SDF-1α and CatK in GSLC niches. In accordance, 2D and 3D invasion experiments using CXCR4/CXCR7-expressing GSLCs and GBM cells showed that SDF-1α had chemotactic activity whereas CatK cleavage products of SDF-1α did not. Besides, CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor inhibited invasion of CXCR4/CXCR7-expressing GSLCs. In conclusion, CatK can cleave and inactivate SDF-1α. This implies that CatK activity facilitates migration of GSLCs out of niches. We propose that activation of CatK may be a promising strategy to prevent homing of GSLCs in niches and thus render these cells sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation.

Abstract: Enzymes of CYP74 family play the central role in the biosynthesis of physiologically important oxylipins in land plants. Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty acid hydroperoxides. Linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α-Linolenic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid 15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. Both epoxide and hydroxyl oxygen atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [18O2]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS). The results show that the EsEAS isomerizes the hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols via epoxyallylic radical, a common intermediate of different CYP74s and related enzymes. EsEAS can be considered as an archaic prototype of CYP74 family enzymes.

Abstract: Emerin is an inner nuclear membrane protein that is involved in maintaining the mechanical integrity of the nuclear membrane. Increasing evidence supports the involvement of emerin in the regulation of gene expression; however, its precise function remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that emerin downregulated genes downstream of Notch signaling, which are activated exclusively by the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Deletion mutant experiments revealed that the transmembrane domain of emerin is important for the inhibition of Notch signaling. Emerin interacted directly and colocalized with the NICD at the nuclear membrane. Emerin knockdown induced the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, increased endogenous Notch signaling, and inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Notably, the downregulation of barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) or lamin A/C increased Notch signaling by inducing the release of emerin into the cytosol, implying that nuclear membrane-bound emerin acts as an endogenous inhibitor of Notch signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that emerin negatively regulates Notch signaling by promoting the retention of the NICD at the nuclear membrane. This mechanism could constitute a new therapeutic target for the treatment of emerin-related diseases.

Abstract: Mammalian lipoxygenases (LOX) have been implicated in cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory, hyperproliferative and neurological diseases. Although the reaction specificity of mammalian LOX with n−6 fatty acids (linoleic acid, arachidonic acid) has been explored in detail little information is currently available on the product patterns formed from n−3 polyenoic fatty acids, which are of particular nutritional importance and serve as substrate for the biosynthesis of pro-resolving inflammatory mediators such as resolvins and maresins. Here we expressed the ALOX15 orthologs of eight different mammalian species as well as human ALOX12 and ALOX15B as recombinant his-tag fusion proteins and characterized their reaction specificity with the most abundantly occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We found that the LOX isoforms tested accept these fatty acids as suitable substrates and oxygenate them with variable positional specificity to the corresponding n−6 and n−9 hydroperoxy derivatives. Surprisingly, human ALOX15 as well as the corresponding orthologs of chimpanzee and orangutan, which oxygenates arachidonic acid mainly to 15S-H(p)ETE, exhibit a pronounced dual reaction specificity with DHA forming similar amounts of 14- and 17-H(p)DHA. Moreover, ALOX15 orthologs prefer DHA and EPA over AA when equimolar concentrations of n−3 and n−6 PUFA were supplied simultaneously. Taken together, these data indicate that the reaction specificity of mammalian LOX isoforms is variable and strongly depends on the chemistry of fatty acid substrates. Most mammalian ALOX15 orthologs exhibit dual positional specificity with highly unsaturated n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Abstract: Obesity and diabetes are known risk factors for dementia, and it is speculated that chronic neuroinflammation contributes to this increased risk. Microglia are brain-resident immune cells modulating the neuroinflammatory state. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the major ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of fish oil, exhibit various effects, which include shifting microglia to the anti-inflammatory phenotype. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved, we examined the impact of EPA, DHA, and EPA+DHA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine profiles and the associated signaling pathways in the mouse microglial line MG6. Both EPA and DHA suppressed the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 by LPS-stimulated MG6 cells, and this was also observed in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells, the other microglial line. Moreover, the EPA+DHA mixture activated SIRT1 signaling by enhancing mRNA level of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), cellular NAD+ level, SIRT1 protein deacetylase activity, and SIRT1 mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated MG6. EPA+DHA also inhibited phosphorylation of the stress-associated transcription factor NF-κB subunit p65 at Ser536, which is known to enhance NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity, including cytokine gene activation. Further, EPA+DHA increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, an indicator of autophagy. Suppression of TNF-α and IL-6 production, inhibition of p65 phosphorylation, and autophagy induction were abrogated by a SIRT1 inhibitor. On the other hand, NAMPT inhibition reversed TNF-α suppression but not IL-6 suppression. Accordingly, these ω-3 PUFAs may suppress neuroinflammation through SIRT1-mediated inhibition of the microglial NF-κB stress response and ensue pro-inflammatory cytokine release, which is implicated in NAMPT-related and –unrelated pathways.

TNF-α decreases lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by up-regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 4,

Abstract: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes lipids in plasma lipoproteins so that the fatty acids can be taken up and used by cells. The activity of LPL changes rapidly in response to changes in nutrition, physical activity and other conditions. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is an important controller of LPL activity. Both LPL and ANGPTL4 are produced and secreted by adipocytes. When the transcription blocker Actinomycin D was added to cultures of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, LPL activity in the medium increased several-fold. LPL mRNA decreased moderately during 5h, while ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein declined rapidly, explaining that LPL activity was increased. TNF-α is known to reduce LPL activity in adipose tissue. We have shown that TNF-α increased ANGPTL4 both at the mRNA and protein level. Expression of ANGPTL4 is known to be under control of Foxo1. Use of the Foxo1-specific inhibitor AS1842856, or knockdown of ANGPTL4 by RNAi, resulted in increased LPL activity in the medium. Both with ActD and with the Foxo1 inhibitor the cells became unresponsive to TNF-α. This study shows that TNF-α, by a Foxo1 dependent pathway, increases the transcription of ANGPTL4 which is secreted by the cells and causes inactivation of LPL.

Abstract: Members of the herpesviral family use multiple strategies to hijack infected host cells and exploit cellular signaling for their pathogenesis and latent infection. Among the most intriguing weapons in the arsenal of pathogenic herpesviruses are the constitutively active virally-encoded G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs). Even though vGPCRs contribute to viral pathogenesis such as immune evasion and proliferative disorders, the molecular details of how vGPCRs continuously activate cellular signaling are largely unknown. Here, we report that the vGPCR of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), an oncogenic γ2-herpesvirus, constitutively activates T cells via a heteromeric interaction with cellular CXCR4. Constitutive T cell activation also occurs with expression of the vGPCR of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), but not the vGPCR of Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of HVS vGPCR down-regulated the surface expression of CXCR4 but did not induce the degradation of the chemokine receptor, suggesting that vGPCR/CXCR4 signaling continues in cytosolic compartments. The physical association of vGPCR with CXCR4 was demonstrated by proximity ligation assay as well as immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, the constitutive activation of T cells by HVS vGPCR is independent of proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling molecules, such as TCRβ, Lck, and ZAP70, whereas CXCR4 silencing by shRNA abolished T cell activation by vGPCRs of HVS and KSHV. Furthermore, previously identified inactive vGPCR mutants failed to interact with CXCR4. These findings on the positive cooperativity of vGPCR with cellular CXCR4 in T cell activation extend our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vGPCR function and highlight the importance of heteromerization for GPCR activity.

Abstract: Nanotubes (NTs) are thin, long membranous structures forming novel, yet poorly known communication pathways between various cell types. Key mechanisms controlling their growth still remained poorly understood. Since NT-forming capacity of immature and mature B cells was found largely different, we investigated how lipid composition and molecular order of the membrane affect NT-formation. Screening B cell lines with various differentiation stages revealed that NT-growth linearly correlates with membrane ganglioside levels, while it shows maximum as a function of cholesterol level. NT-growth of B lymphocytes is promoted by raftophilic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species, various glycosphingolipids, and docosahexaenoic acid-containing inner leaflet lipids, through supporting membrane curvature, as demonstrated by comparative lipidomic analysis of mature versus immature B cell membranes. Targeted modification of membrane cholesterol and sphingolipid levels altered NT-forming capacity confirming these findings, and also highlighted that the actual lipid raft number may control NT-growth via defining the number of membrane-F-actin coupling sites. Atomic force microscopic mechano-manipulation experiments further proved that mechanical properties (elasticity or bending stiffness) of B cell NTs also depend on the actual membrane lipid composition. Data presented here highlight importance of the lipid side in controlling intercellular, nanotubular, regulatory communications in the immune system.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound intercellular communication vehicles that transport proteins, lipids and nucleic acids with regulatory capacity between cells. RNA profiling using microarrays and sequencing technologies has revolutionized the discovery of EV-RNA content, which is crucial to understand the molecular mechanism of EV function. Recent studies have indicated that EVs are enriched with specific RNAs compared to the originating cells suggestive of an active sorting mechanism. Here, we present the comparative transcriptome analysis of human osteoblasts and their corresponding EVs using next-generation sequencing. We demonstrate that osteoblast-EVs are specifically depleted of cellular mRNAs that encode proteins involved in basic cellular activities, such as cytoskeletal functions, cell survival and apoptosis. In contrast, EVs are significantly enriched with 254 mRNAs that are associated with protein translation and RNA processing. Moreover, mRNAs enriched in EVs encode proteins important for communication with the neighboring cells, in particular with osteoclasts, adipocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. These findings provide the foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism and function of EV-mediated interactions between osteoblasts and the surrounding bone microenvironment.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived cells are thought to participate and enhance the healing process contributing to skin cells or releasing regulatory cytokines. Directional cell migration in a weak direct current electric field (DC-EF), known as electrotaxis, may be a way of cell recruitment to the wound site. Here we examined the influence of electric field on bone marrow adherent cells (BMACs) and its potential role as a factor attracting mesenchymal stem cells to cutaneous wounds. We observed that in an external EF, BMAC movement was accelerated and highly directed with distinction of two cell populations migrating toward opposite poles: mesenchymal stem cells migrated toward the cathode, whereas macrophages toward the anode. Analysis of intracellular pathways revealed that macrophage electrotaxis mostly depended on Rho family small GTPases and calcium ions, but interruption of PI3K and Arp2/3 had the most pronounced effect on electrotaxis of MSCs. However, in all cases we observed only a partial decrease in directionality of cell movement after inhibition of certain proteins. Additionally, although we noticed the accumulation of EGFR at the cathodal side of MSCs, it was not involved in electrotaxis. Moreover, the cell reaction to EF was very dynamic with first symptoms occurring within <1min. In conclusion, the physiological DC-EF may act as a factor positioning bone marrow cells within a wound bed and the opposite direction of MSC and macrophage movement did not result either from utilizing different signalling or redistribution of investigated cell surface receptors.

Abstract: Aims
To investigate whether haematopoietic TLR4 deletion attenuates perivascular brown adipose tissue inflammation in atherosclerotic mice.
Methods and Results
Experiments were performed using irradiated LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice with marrow from either TLR4-deficient (TLR4−/−) or age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. After 12 weeks of being fed a high-cholesterol diet, TLR4−/−→LDLR−/− mice developed fewer atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta compared to WT→LDLR−/− mice. This effect was associated with an increase in multilocular lipid droplets and mitochondria in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that there was an increase in capillary density and M2 macrophage infiltration, accompanied by a decrease in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in the localized PVAT of TLR4−/−→LDLR−/− mice. In vitro studies indicated that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT mice demonstrated an M1-like phenotype and expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by palmitate. These effects were attenuated in BMDMs isolated from TLR4−/− mice. Furthermore, brown adipocytes incubated with conditioned medium (CM) derived from palmitate-treated BMDMs, exhibited larger and more unilocular lipid droplets, and reduced expression of brown adipocyte-specific markers and perilipin-1 compared to those observed in brown adipocytes exposed to CM from palmitate-treated BMDMs of TLR4−/− mice. This decreased potency was primarily due to TNF-α, as demonstrated by the capacity of the TNF-α neutralizing antibody to reverse these effects.
Conclusions
These results suggest that haematopoietic-specific deletion of TLR4 promotes PVAT homeostasis, which is involved in reducing macrophage-induced TNF-α secretion and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in brown adipocytes.

Abstract: Aims
Our previous studies have established a role for 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO) in mediating the inflammatory response in diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the extent at which the local or systemic induction of 12/15-LO activity involved is unclear. Thus, the current study aimed to characterize the relative contribution of retinal endothelial versus monocytic/macrophagic 12/15-LO to inflammatory responses in DR.
Materials & methods
We first generated a clustered heat map for circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in the plasma of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice using liquid chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry (LC–MS) to evaluate changes in circulating 12/15-LO activity. This was followed by comparing the in vitro mouse endothelium-leukocytes interaction between leukocytes isolated from 12/15-LO knockout (KO) versus those isolated from wild type (WT) mice using the myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. Finally, we examined the effects of knocking down or inhibiting endothelial 12/15-LO on diabetes-induced endothelial cell activation and ICAM-1 expression.
Results
Analysis of plasma bioactive lipids' heat map revealed that the activity of circulating 12/15-LO was not altered by diabetes as evident by no significant changes in the plasma levels of major metabolites derived from 12/15-lipoxygenation of different PUFAs, including linoleic acid (13-HODE), arachidonic acid (12- and 15- HETEs), eicosapentaenoic acid (12- and 15- HEPEs), or docosahexaenoic acid (17-HDoHE). Moreover, leukocytes from 12/15-LO KO mice displayed a similar increase in adhesion to high glucose (HG)-activated endothelial cells as do leukocytes from WT mice. Furthermore, abundant proteins of 12-LO and 15-LO were detected in human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs), while it was undetected (15-LO) or hardly detectable (12-LO) in human monocyte-like U937 cells. Inhibition or knock down of endothelial 12/15-LO in HRECs blocked HG-induced expression of ICAM-1, a well-known identified important molecule for leukocyte adhesion in DR.
Conclusion
Our data support that endothelial, rather than monocytic/macrophagic, 12/15-LO has a critical role in hyperglycemia-induced ICAM-1 expression, leukocyte adhesion, and subsequent local retinal barrier dysfunction. This may facilitate the development of more precisely targeted treatment strategies for DR.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play an important role in liver physiology and under healthy conditions they have a quiescent and lipid-storing phenotype. Upon liver injury, HSCs are activated and rapidly lose their retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets. To investigate the role of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) in retinyl ester synthesis and lipid droplet dynamics, we modified LC–MS/MS procedures by including multiple reaction monitoring allowing unambiguous identification and quantification of all major retinyl ester species. Quiescent primary HSCs contain predominantly retinyl palmitate. Exogenous fatty acids are a major determinant in the retinyl ester species synthesized by activated HSCs and LX-2 cells, indicating that HSCs shift their retinyl ester synthesizing capacity from LRAT to DGAT1 during activation. Quiescent LRAT−/− HSCs retain the capacity to synthesize retinyl esters and to store neutral lipids in lipid droplets ex vivo. The median lipid droplet size in LRAT−/− HSCs (1080nm) is significantly smaller than in wild type HSCs (1618nm). This is a consequence of an altered lipid droplet size distribution with 50.5±9.0% small (≤700nm) lipid droplets in LRAT−/− HSCs and 25.6±1.4% large (1400–2100nm) lipid droplets in wild type HSC cells. Upon prolonged (24h) incubation, the amounts of small (≤700nm) lipid droplets strongly increased both in wild type and in LRAT−/− HSCs, indicating a dynamic behavior in both cell types. The absence of retinyl esters and reduced number of lipid droplets in LRAT-deficient HSCs in vivo will be discussed.

Abstract: Lipoxygenases (LOXs), participating in inflammatory processes and cancer, are a family of enzymes with high potential as drug targets. Various allosteric effects have been observed with different LOX isozymes (e.g. lipid/ATP binding, phosphorylation), yet there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the regulation of these enzymes. It has been recently found that a number of LOXs form dimers, extending the list of possible allosteric mechanisms with oligomerization. Coral 11R-LOX is, unlike several mammalian counterparts, a stable dimer in solution facilitating quaternary structure studies that demand high sample homogeneity. By combining previous crystallographic data of 11R-LOX with small-angle X-ray scattering and chemical cross-linking, we were able to narrow down the possible dimerization interfaces, and subsequently determined the correct assembly by site-directed mutagenesis of potential contacting residues. The region of interest is located in the vicinity of an α+β formation in the catalytic domain, also coined the PDZ-like domain. Being situated just between the active site and the dimer interface, our results further implicate this putative subdomain in the regulation of LOXs.

Arachidonic acid is important for efficient use of light by the microalga Lobosphaera incisa under chilling stress,

Abstract: The oleaginous microalga Lobosphaera incisa (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) contains arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4 n−6) in all membrane glycerolipids and in the storage lipid triacylglycerol. The optimal growth temperature of the wild-type (WT) strain is 25°C; chilling temperatures (≤15°C) slow its growth. This effect is more pronounced in the delta-5-desaturase ARA-deficient mutant P127, in which ARA is replaced with dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3 n−6). In nutrient-replete cells grown at 25°C, the major chloroplast lipid monogalactosylglycerol (MGDG) was dominated by C18/C16 species in both strains. Yet ARA constituted over 10% of the total fatty acids in the WT MGDG as a component of C20/C18 and C20/C20 species, whereas DGLA was only a minor component of MGDG in P127. Both strains increased the percentage of 18:3 n−3 in membrane lipids under chilling temperatures. The temperature downshift led to a dramatic increase in triacylglycerol at the expense of chloroplast lipids. WT and P127 showed a similarly high photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II, whereas non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and violaxanthin de-epoxidation were drastically higher in P127, especially at 15°C. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated that ARA-containing MGDG might contribute to sustaining chloroplast membrane fluidity upon dropping to the chilling temperature. We hypothesize that conformational changes in chloroplast membranes and increased rigidity of the ARA-deficient MGDG of P127 at chilling temperatures are not compensated by trienoic fatty acids. This might ‘lock’ violaxanthin de-epoxidase in the activated state causing high constitutive NPQ and alleviate the risk of photodamage under chilling conditions in the mutant.

Abstract: Lipids have many central physiological roles including as structural components of cell membranes, energy storage sources and intermediates in signaling pathways. Lipid-related disturbances are known to underlie many diseases and their co-morbidities. The emergence of lipidomics has empowered researchers to study lipid metabolism at the cellular as well as physiological levels at a greater depth than was previously possible. The key challenges ahead in the field of lipidomics in medical research lie in the development of experimental protocols and in silico techniques needed to study lipidomes at the systems level. Clinical questions where lipidomics may have an impact in healthcare settings also need to be identified, both from the health outcomes and health economics perspectives.

Abstract: Fatty acid amides (FAAs), conjugates of fatty acids with ethanolamine, mono-amine neurotransmitters or amino acids are a class of molecules that display diverse functional roles in different cells and tissues. Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.

Abstract: Mansonic schistosomiasis is a disease caused by the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, endemic to tropical countries. S. mansoni infection induces the formation of granulomas and potent polarization of Th2-type immune response. There is great interest in understanding the mechanisms used by this parasite that causes a modulation of the immune system. Recent studies from our group demonstrated that lipids of S. mansoni, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) have immunomodulatory activity. In the present study, our aim was to investigate the role of lipids derived from S. mansoni in the activation and polarization of macrophages and to characterize the mechanisms involved in this process. Peritoneal macrophages obtained from wild type C57BL/6mice or bone marrow derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with lipids extracted from adult worms of S. mansoni. We demonstrated that total schistosomal-derived lipids as well as purified LPC induced alternatively activated macrophages/M2 profile observed by increased expression of arginase-1, mannose receptor, Chi3l3, TGFβ and production of IL-10 and PGE2 24h after stimulation. The involvement of the nuclear receptor PPARγ in macrophage response against LPC was investigated. Through Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy we demonstrated that schistosomal-derived LPC induces increased expression of PPARγ in macrophages. The LPC-induced increased expression of arginase-1 were significantly inhibited by the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. Together, these results demonstrate an immunomodulatory role of schistosomal-derived LPC in activating macrophages to a profile of the type M2 through PPARγ-dependent mechanisms, indicating a novel pathway for macrophage polarization triggered by parasite-derived LPC with potential implications to disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Obesity promotes the biogenesis of adipose tissue (AT) foam cells (FC), which contribute to AT insulin resistance. Autophagy, an evolutionarily-conserved house-keeping process, was implicated in cellular lipid handling by either feeding and/or degrading lipid-droplets (LDs). We hypothesized that beyond phagocytosis of dead adipocytes, AT-FC biogenesis is supported by the AT microenvironment by regulating autophagy. Non-polarized (“M0”) RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to AT conditioned media (AT-CM) exhibited a markedly enhanced LDs biogenesis rate compared to control cells (8.3 Vs 0.3 LDs/cells/h, p<0.005). Autophagic flux was decreased by AT-CM, and fluorescently following autophagosomes over time revealed ~20% decline in new autophagic vesicles' formation rate, and 60–70% decrease in autophagosomal growth rate, without marked alternations in the acidic lysosomal compartment. Suppressing autophagy by either targeting autophagosome formation (pharmacologically, with 3-methyladenine or genetically, with Atg12±Atg7-siRNA), decreased the rate of LD formation induced by oleic acid. Conversely, interfering with late autophago-lysosomal function, either pharmacologically with bafilomycin-A1, chloroquine or leupeptin, enhanced LD formation in macrophages without affecting LD degradation rate. Similarly enhanced LD biogenesis rate was induced by siRNA targeting Lamp-1 or the V-ATPase. Collectively, we propose that secreted products from AT interrupt late autophagosome maturation in macrophages, supporting enhanced LDs biogenesis and AT-FC formation, thereby contributing to AT dysfunction in obesity.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that at least two pools of plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can supply the brain: non-esterified DHA (NE-DHA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPtdCho)-DHA. In contrast to NE-DHA, brain uptake of lysoPtdCho-DHA appears to be mediated by a specific transporter, but whether both forms of DHA supply undergo the same metabolic fate, particularly with regards to enrichment of specific phospholipid (PL) subclasses, remains to be determined. This study aimed to evaluate brain uptake of NE-DHA and lysoPtdCho-DHA into brain PL classes. Fifteen-week-old rats were infused intravenously with radiolabelled NE-14C-DHA or lysoPtdCho-14C-DHA (n=4/group) over five mins to achieve a steady-state plasma level. PLs were extracted from the brain and separated by thin layer chromatography and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The net rate of entry of lysoPtdCho-DHA into the brain was between 59% and 86% lower than the net rate of entry of NE-DHA, depending on the PL class. The proportion of total PL radioactivity in the lysoPtdCho-14C-DHA group compared to the NE-14C-DHA group was significantly higher in choline glycerophospholipids (ChoGpl) (48% vs 28%, respectively) but lower in ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (EtnGpl) (32% vs 46%, respectively). In both groups, radioactivity was disproportionally high in phosphatidylinositol and ChoGpl but low in phosphatidylserine and EtnGpl compared to the corresponding DHA pool size. This suggests that DHA undergoes extensive PL remodeling after entry into the brain.

Abstract: The genome of the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum harbors six catalases, one of which has the sequence characteristics of a fatty acid peroxide-metabolizing catalase. We cloned and expressed this hemoprotein (designated as Fg-cat) along with its immediate neighbor, a 13S-lipoxygenase (cf. Brodhun et al., PloS One, e64919, 2013) that we considered might supply a fatty acid hydroperoxide substrate. Indeed, Fg-cat reacts abruptly with the 13S-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (13S-HPODE) with an initial rate of 700–1300s−1. By comparison there was no reaction with 9R- or 9S-HPODEs and extremely weak reaction with 13R-HPODE (~0.5% of the rate with 13S-HPODE). Although we considered Fg-cat as a candidate for the allene oxide synthase of the jasmonate pathway in fungi, the main product formed from 13S-HPODE was identified by UV, MS, and NMR as 9-oxo-10E-12,13-cis-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (with no traces of AOS activity). The corresponding analog is formed from the 13S-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid along with novel diepoxy-ketones and two C13 aldehyde derivatives, the reaction mechanisms of which are proposed. In a peroxidase assay monitoring the oxidation of ABTS, Fg-cat exhibited robust activity (kcat 550s−1) using the 13S-hydroperoxy-C18 fatty acids as the oxidizing co-substrate. There was no detectable peroxidase activity using the corresponding 9S-hydroperoxides, nor with t-butyl hydroperoxide, and very weak activity with H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide at micromolar concentrations of Fg-cat. Fg-cat and the associated lipoxygenase gene are present together in fungal genera Fusarium, Metarhizium and Fonsecaea and appear to constitute a partnership for oxidations in fungal metabolism or defense.

Abstract: The identification and quantification of lipids from plant tissues have become commonplace and many researchers now incorporate lipidomics approaches into their experimental studies. Plant lipidomics research continues to involve technological developments such as those in mass spectrometry imaging, but in large part, lipidomics approaches have matured to the point of being accessible to the novice. Here we review some important considerations for those planning to apply plant lipidomics to their biological questions, and offer suggestions for appropriate tools and practices.

Abstract: Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins are frequently present at higher levels than the wild-type (wt) protein in tumors, and some of them can acquire oncogenic properties. Consistently, knockdown of mutp53 protein in human cancer cell lines leads to reduced cell proliferation and invasion as well as to an increased sensitivity to some anticancer drugs. Therefore, the exploitation of cellular pathways and/or molecules that promote mutp53 degradation may have a therapeutic interest. Recently, autophagy is emerging as an important pathway involved in the stability of mutp53. In this paper, we explored the autophagic potential of gambogic acid (GA), a molecule that stimulates the degradation of mutp53 and increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We demonstrated that GA may induce mutp53 degradation through autophagy in cancer cells expressing the p53-R280K (MDA-MB-231) and the p53-S241F (DLD1) proteins. The inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine counteracted mutp53 degradation by GA. However, the autophagy induction and mutp53 degradation affected cell survival and proliferation only at low GA concentrations. At higher GA concentrations, when cells undergo massive apoptosis, autophagy is no longer detectable by immuno-fluorescence analysis. We concluded that autophagy is a relevant pathway for mutp53 degradation in cancer cells but it contributes only partially to GA-induced cell death, in a time and dose-dependent manner.

Abstract: Iron depletion (ID) has been shown to induce the liver expression of Cyp7a1, the rate-limiting enzyme initiating conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (BA), although the effect on bile acids metabolism and bile production is unknown. Therefore, we investigated changes in bile secretion and BA synthesis during diet-induced iron depletion (ID) in rats. ID increased bile flow along with augmented biliary excretion of bile acids, glutathione, cholesterol and phospholipids. Accordingly, we found transcriptional upregulation of the Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp27a1 BA synthetic enzymes, as well as induction of the Abcg5/8 cholesterol transporters in ID rat livers. In contrast, intravenous infusion of 3H-taurocholate failed to elicit any difference in biliary secretion of this compound in the ID rats. This corresponded with unchanged expression of canalicular rate-limiting transporters for BA as well as glutathione. We also observed that ID substantially changed the spectrum of BA in bile and decreased plasma concentrations of BA and cholesterol. Experiments with differentiated human hepatic HepaRG cells confirmed human CYP7A1 orthologue upregulation resulting from reduced iron concentrations. Results employing a luciferase reporter gene assay suggest that the transcriptional activation of the CYP7A1 promoter under ID conditions works independent of farnesoid X (FXR), pregnane X (PXR) and liver X (LXRα) receptors activation. It can be concluded that this study characterizes the molecular mechanisms of modified bile production as well as cholesterol as along with BA homeostasis during ID. We propose complex upregulation of BA synthesis, and biliary cholesterol secretion as the key factors affected by ID.

Palmitoylation of cysteine 415 of CB1 receptor affects ligand-stimulated internalization and selective interaction with membrane cholesterol and caveolin 1,

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that CB1 receptor is palmitoylated at cysteine 415, and that such a post-translational modification affects its biological activity. To assess the molecular mechanisms responsible for modulation of CB1 receptor function by S-palmitoylation, in this study biochemical and morphological approaches were paralleled with computational analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that this acyl chain stabilizes helix 8 as well as the interaction of CB1 receptor with membrane cholesterol. In keeping with these in silico data, experimental results showed that the non-palmitoylated CB1 receptor was unable to interact efficaciously with caveolin 1, independently of its activation state. Moreover, in contrast with the wild-type receptor, the lack of S-palmitoylation in the helix 8 made the mutant CB1 receptor completely irresponsive to agonist-induced effects in terms of both lipid raft partitioning and receptor internalization. Overall, our results support the notion that palmitoylation of cysteine 415 modulates the conformational state of helix 8 and influences the interactions of CB1 receptor with cholesterol and caveolin 1, suggesting that the palmitoyl chain may serve as a functional interface for CB1 receptor localization and function.

Abscisic acid enhances glucose disposal and induces brown fat activity in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo,

Abstract: Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone also present in animals, where it is involved in the regulation of innate immune cell function and of glucose disposal, through its receptor LANCL2. ABA stimulates glucose uptake by myocytes and pre-adipocytes in vitro and oral ABA improves glycemic control in rats and in healthy subjects. Here we investigated the role of the ABA/LANCL2 system in the regulation of glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes. Silencing of LANCL2 abrogated both the ABA- and insulin-induced increase of glucose transporter-4 expression and of glucose uptake in differentiated 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes; conversely, overexpression of LANCL2 enhanced basal, ABA- and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. As compared with insulin, ABA treatment of adipocytes induced lower triglyceride accumulation, CO2 production and glucose-derived fatty acid synthesis. ABA per se did not induce pre-adipocyte differentiation in vitro, but stimulated adipocyte remodeling in terminally differentiated cells, with a reduction in cell size, increased mitochondrial content, enhanced O2 consumption, increased transcription of adiponectin and of brown adipose tissue (BAT) genes. A single dose of oral ABA (1μg/kg body weight) increased BAT glucose uptake 2-fold in treated rats compared with untreated controls. One-month-long ABA treatment at the same daily dose significantly upregulated expression of BAT markers in the WAT and in WAT-derived preadipocytes from treated mice compared with untreated controls. These results indicate a hitherto unknown role of LANCL2 in adipocyte sensitivity to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and suggest a role for ABA in the induction and maintenance of BAT activity.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides, cholesterol and toxic free fatty acids and is related to low vitamin D levels. In an analysis of specific gene sets we elucidate to what extent NAFLD associates to epigenetic and related transcriptional changes in gene networks regulating lipid, energy and vitamin D balance. Two gene clusters responsible for lipid homeostasis (74 genes) and vitamin D and energy balance (31 genes) were investigated with regard to average epigenetic shifts within the first 1500bp next to the transcriptional start site. Three cohorts from two published genome wide driven studies that used a microarray approach were investigated including altogether 103 NAFLD and 75 liver healthy subjects. In the first two steps associations between NAFLD abundance, strength of fibrosis and methylation were investigated in two cohorts by multiple linear regression analyses, correcting for important clinical and demographic parameters. Methylation associated strength of transcription in genes showing significant NAFLD related methylation changes were studied in a third step using a third cohort and applying Pearson's correlation and robust linear regression analyses. 41 genes in gene cluster 1 and 14 genes in cluster 2 were significantly differentially methylated in dependency of NAFLD and hepatic fibrosis. We detect new genes significantly changed in methylation, including APO family members (lipid transport), NPC1L1, STARD (cholesterol transport) and GRHL (energy homeostasis). Our results allow novel insights into the hepatic epigenetic regulation of genes important for lipid and vitamin D balance in NAFLD.

Abstract: Although the foundations of mass spectrometry-based lipidomics have been practiced for over 30 years, recent technological advances in ionization modalities in conjunction with robust increases in mass accuracy and resolution have greatly accelerated the emergence, growth and importance of the field of lipidomics. Moreover, advances in the separation sciences, bioinformatic strategies and the availability of robust databases have been synergistically integrated into modern lipidomic technologies leading to unprecedented improvements in the depth, penetrance and precision of lipidomic analyses and identification of their biological and mechanistic significance. The purpose of this "opinion" article is to briefly review the evolution of lipidomics, critique the platforms that have evolved and identify areas that are likely to emerge in the years to come. Through seamlessly integrating a rich repertoire of mass spectrometric, chemical and bioinformatic strategies, the chemical identities and quantities of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of different lipid molecular species and their metabolic alterations during physiologic or pathophysiologic perturbations can be obtained. Thus, the field of lipidomics which already has a distinguished history of exciting new discoveries in many disease states holds unparalleled potential to identify the pleiotropic roles of lipids in health and disease at the chemical level.

Abstract: A challenge for sphingolipidomic analysis is the vast number of subspecies, including a large number of isomers—a complication that was even appreciated by the original discoverer of sphingolipids J. L. W. Thudichum (The Chemistry of the Brain, p. x, 1884): “In the course of my researches many unforeseen complications arose, prominent amongst which were those caused by the occurrence of chemical principles having the same atomic or elementary composition, but differing in other chemical, or in physical properties, varieties producing the phenomenon which in chemistry is termed isomerism.” Therefore, it is essential to choose the appropriate method(s) for the goal of the analysis, to know the assumptions and limitations of method(s) used, and to temper interpretation of the data accordingly.

Deficiency of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 decreases triacylglycerol storage and induces fatty acid oxidation in insect fat body,

Abstract: Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT) catalyze the initial and rate-limiting step for the de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). Four mammalian GPAT isoforms have been identified: the mitochondria-associated GPAT1 and 2, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated GPAT3 and 4. In the insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, we previously predicted a mitochondrial-like isoform (RhoprGPAT1) from genomic data. In the current study, we clone the RhoprGPAT1 coding sequence and identify an ER-associated GPAT (RhoprGPAT4) as the second isoform in the insect. RhoprGPAT1 contributes 15% of the total GPAT activity in anterior midgut, 50% in posterior midgut and fat body, and 70% in the ovary. The RhoprGpat1 gene is the predominant transcript in the midgut and fat body. To evaluate the physiological relevance of RhoprGPAT1, we generate RhoprGPAT1-deficient insects. The knockdown of RhoprGpat1 results in 50% and 65% decrease in TAG content in the posterior midgut and fat body, respectively. RhoprGpat1-deficient insects also exhibits impaired lipid droplet expansion and a 2-fold increase in fatty acid β-oxidation rates in the fat body. We propose that the RhoprGPAT1 mitochondrial-like isoform is required to channel fatty acyl chains towards TAG synthesis and away from β-oxidation. Such a process is crucial for the insect lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors are a new class of therapeutics for dyslipidemia that simultaneously improve two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors: elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying their efficacy are poorly understood, as are any potential mechanistic differences among the drugs in this class. Herein, we used electron microscopy (EM) to investigate the effects of three of these agents (Torcetrapib, Dalcetrapib and Anacetrapib) on CETP structure, CETP-lipoprotein complex formation and CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer. We found that although none of these inhibitors altered the structure of CETP or the conformation of CETP-lipoprotein binary complexes, all inhibitors, especially Torcetrapib and Anacetrapib, increased the binding ratios of the binary complexes (e.g., HDL-CETP and LDL-CETP) and decreased the binding ratios of the HDL-CETP-LDL ternary complexes. The findings of more binary complexes and fewer ternary complexes reflect a new mechanism of inhibition: one distal end of CETP bound to the first lipoprotein would trigger a conformational change at the other distal end, thus resulting in a decreased binding ratio to the second lipoprotein and a degraded CE transfer rate among lipoproteins. Thus, we suggest a new inhibitor design that should decrease the formation of both binary and ternary complexes. Decreased concentrations of the binary complex may prevent the inhibitor was induced into cell by the tight binding of binary complexes during lipoprotein metabolism in the treatment of CVD.

Abstract: The importance of peroxisomes for adipocyte function is poorly understood. Herein, we provide insights into the critical role of peroxin 16 (PEX16)-mediated peroxisome biogenesis in adipocyte development and lipid metabolism. Pex16 is highly expressed in adipose tissues and upregulated during adipogenesis of murine and human cells. We demonstrate that Pex16 is a target gene of the adipogenesis “master-regulator” PPARγ. Stable silencing of Pex16 in 3T3-L1 cells strongly reduced the number of peroxisomes while mitochondrial number was unaffected. Concomitantly, peroxisomal fatty acid (FA) oxidation was reduced, thereby causing accumulation of long- and very long-chain (polyunsaturated) FAs and reduction of odd-chain FAs. Further, Pex16-silencing decreased cellular oxygen consumption and increased FA release. Additionally, silencing of Pex16 impaired adipocyte differentiation, lipogenic and adipogenic marker gene expression, and cellular triglyceride stores. Addition of PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone and peroxisome-related lipid species to Pex16-silenced 3T3-L1 cells rescued adipogenesis. These data provide evidence that PEX16 is required for peroxisome biogenesis and highlights the relevance of peroxisomes for adipogenesis and adipocyte lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Cystic kidney diseases are characterized by multiple renal cysts and are the leading cause of inherited renal disease. Oxylipins are bioactive lipids derived from fatty acids formed via cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 activity, and are important regulators of renal health and disease. Oxylipins are altered in nephronophthisis, a type of cystic kidney disease. To further investigate and to determine whether other cystic renal diseases share these abnormalities, a targeted lipidomic analysis of renal oxylipins was performed in orthologous models of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 1 (Mx1Cre+Pkd1flox/flox mouse) and 2 (Pkd2ws25/− mouse), autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PCK rat) and nephronophthisis (jck/jck mouse). Kidney cyclooxygenase oxylipins were consistently higher in all diseased kidneys, even in very early stage disease. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 epoxygenase derived oxylipins were lower only in the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis models, while lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 hydroxylase derived oxylipins were lower only in nephronophthisis. Sex effects on renal oxylipin alterations were observed but they did not always coincide with sex effects on disease. For oxylipins with sex effects, arachidonic acid derived oxylipins formed via cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases were higher in females, while oxylipins from other fatty acids and via cytochrome P450 enzymes were higher in males. The consistent and unique patterns of oxylipin alterations in the different models indicates the importance of these bioactive lipids in cystic renal diseases, suggesting that pharmacological agents (e.g. cyclooxygenase inhibitors) may be useful in treating these disorders, for which effective treatment remains elusive.

Abstract: The ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7), which is highly expressed in the brain, is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological function of ABCA7 and its transport substrates remain unclear. Immunohistochemical analyses of human brain sections from AD and non-AD subjects revealed that ABCA7 is expressed in neuron and microglia cells in the cerebral cortex. The transport substrates and acceptors were identified in BHK/ABCA7 cells and compared with those of ABCA1. Like ABCA1, ABCA7 exported choline phospholipids in the presence of apoA-I and apoE; however, unlike ABCA1, cholesterol efflux was marginal. Lipid efflux by ABCA7 was saturated by 5μg/ml apoA-I and was not dependent on apoE isoforms, whereas efflux by ABCA1 was dependent on apoA-I up to 20μg/ml and apoE isoforms. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the two proteins had different preferences for phospholipid export: ABCA7 preferred phosphatidylcholine (PC)≥lysoPC>sphingomyelin (SM)=phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), whereas ABCA1 preferred PC>>SM>PE=lysoPC. The major difference in the pattern of lipid peaks between ABCA7 and ABCA1 was the high lysoPC/PC ratio of ABCA7. These results suggest that lysoPC is one of the major transport substrates for ABCA7 and that lysoPC export may be a physiologically important function of ABCA7 in the brain.

New insights into cellular cholesterol acquisition: promoter analysis of human HMGCR and SQLE, two key control enzymes in cholesterol synthesis,

Abstract: Background
The two control points of cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) are known targets of the transcription factor sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). Yet the location of the sterol-regulatory elements (SREs) and cofactor binding sites, nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1), have not been satisfactorily mapped in the human SQLE promoter, or at all in the human HMGCR promoter.
Methods
We used luciferase reporter assays to screen the sterol-responsiveness of a library of predicted SRE, Sp1 and NF-Y site mutants and hence identify bone fide binding sites. We confirmed SREs via an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP-PCR.
Results
We identified two SREs in close proximity in both the human HMGCR and SQLE promoters, as well as one NF-Y site in HMGCR and two in SQLE. In addition, we found that HMGCR expression is highly activated only when SREBP-2 levels are very high, in contrast to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a result reflected in mouse models used in other studies.
Conclusions
Both HMGCR and SQLE promoters have two SREs that may act as a homing region to attract a single SREBP-2 homodimer, with HMGCR being activated only when there is absolute need for cholesterol synthesis. This ensures preferential uptake of exogenous cholesterol via LDLR, thereby conserving energy.
General Significance
We provide the first comprehensive investigation of SREs and NF-Ys in the human HMGCR and SQLE promoters, increasing our fundamental understanding of the transcriptional regulation of cholesterol synthesis.

Abstract: A new class of steroidal therapeutics based on phylogenetic-guided design of covalent inhibitors that target parasite-specific enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis is shown to prevent growth of the protozoan-Trypanosoma brucei, responsible for sleeping sickness. In the presence of approximately 15±5μM 26,27-dehydrolanosterol, T. brucei procyclic or blood stream form growth is inhibited by 50%. This compound is actively converted by the parasite to an acceptable substrate of sterol C24-methyl transferase (SMT) that upon position-specific side chain methylation at C26 inactivates the enzyme. Treated cells show dose-dependent depletion of ergosterol and other 24β-methyl sterols with no accumulation of intermediates in contradistinction to profiles typical of tight binding inhibitor treatments to azoles showing loss of ergosterol accompanied by accumulation of toxic 14-methyl sterols. HEK cells accumulate 26,27-dehydrolanosterol without effect on cholesterol biosynthesis. During exposure of cloned TbSMT to 26,27-dehydrozymosterol, the enzyme is gradually inactivated (kcat/kinact=0.13min−1/0.08min−1; partition ratio of 1.6) while 26,27-dehydrolanosterol binds nonproductively. GC–MS analysis of the turnover product and bound intermediate released as a C26-methylated diol (C3-OH and C24-OH) confirmed substrate recognition and covalent binding to TbSMT. This study has potential implications for design of a novel class of chemotherapeutic leads functioning as mechanism-based inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis to treat neglected tropical diseases.

Abstract: Plasma cysteine is strongly associated with body fat mass in human cohorts and diets low in cysteine prevents fat accumulation in mice. It is unclear if plasma cysteine affects fat development or if fat accumulation raises plasma cysteine. To determine if cysteine affects adipogenesis, we differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in medium with reduced cysteine. Cells incubated in media with 10–20μM cysteine exhibited reduced capacity to differentiate into triacylglycerol-storing mature adipocytes compared with cells incubated with 50μM cysteine. Low cysteine severely reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (Pparγ2) and its target genes perlipin1 (Plin1) and fatty acid binding protein-4 (Fabp4). Expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1), known to be repressed with cysteine depletion, was also reduced with low cysteine. Medium depletion of the essential amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine had only a modest effect on adipocyte specific gene expression and differentiation. Stimulation with the PPARγ agonist BRL-49653 or addition of a hydrogen sulfide donor enhanced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells cultured in low cysteine. This demonstrates that the ability to induce PPARγ expression is preserved when cells are cultured in low cysteine. It therefore appears that cysteine depletion inhibits adipogenesis by specifically affecting molecular pathways required for induction of PPARγ expression, rather than through a general reduction of global protein synthesis. In conclusion, we show that low extracellular cysteine reduces adipocyte differentiation by interfering with PPARγ2 and PPARγ target gene expression. Our results provide further evidence for the hypothesis that plasma cysteine is a casual determinant for body fat mass.

Abstract: Scaffold proteins are hubs for the coordination of intracellular signaling networks. The scaffold protein CNK1 promotes several signal transduction pathway. Here we demonstrate that sterile motif alpha (SAM) domain-dependent oligomerization of CNK1 stimulates CNK1-mediated signaling in growth factor-stimulated cells. We identified Ser22 located within the SAM domain as AKT-dependent phosphorylation site triggering CNK1 oligomerization. Oligomeric CNK1 increased the affinity for active AKT indicating a positive AKT feedback mechanism. A CNK1 mutant lacking the SAM domain and the phosphorylation-defective mutant CNK1S22A antagonizes oligomerization and prevents CNK1-driven cell proliferation and matrix metalloproteinase 14 promoter activation. The phosphomimetic mutant CNK1S22D constitutively oligomerizes and stimulates CNK1 downstream signaling. Searching the COSMIC database revealed Ser22 as putative target for oncogenic activation of CNK1. Like the phosphomimetic mutant CNK1S22D, the oncogenic mutant CNK1S22F forms clusters in serum-starved cells comparable to clusters of CNK1 in growth factor-stimulated cells. CNK1 clusters induced by activating Ser22 mutants correlate with enhanced cell invasion and binding to and activation of ADP ribosylation factor 1 associated with tumor formation. Mutational analysis indicate that EGF-triggered phosphorylation of Thr8 within the SAM domain prevents AKT binding and antagonizes CNK1-mediated AKT signaling. Our findings reveal SAM domain-dependent oligomerization by AKT as switch for CNK1 activation.

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) produces the largest amount of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Psd1p is synthesized as a larger precursor on cytosolic ribosomes and then imported into mitochondria in a three-step processing event leading to the formation of an α-subunit and a β-subunit. The α-subunit harbors a highly conserved motif, which was proposed to be involved in phosphatidylserine (PS) binding. Here, we present a molecular analysis of this consensus motif for the function of Psd1p by using Psd1p variants bearing either deletions or point mutations in this region. Our data show that mutations in this motif affect processing and stability of Psd1p, and consequently the enzyme's activity. Thus, we conclude that this consensus motif is essential for structural integrity and processing of Psd1p.

Abstract: Mitochondria contain two membranes: the outer and inner membrane. Whereas the outer membrane is particularly enriched in phospholipids, the inner membrane has an unusual high protein content and forms large invaginations termed cristae. The proper phospholipid composition of the membranes is crucial for mitochondrial functions. Phospholipids affect activity, biogenesis and stability of protein complexes including protein translocases and respiratory chain supercomplexes. Negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin are important for the architecture of the membranes and recruit soluble factors to the membranes to support mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, phospholipids not only form the hydrophobic core of biological membranes that surround mitochondria, but also create a specific environment to promote functions of various protein machineries.

Abstract: Increased plasma levels of free fatty acids, including palmitic acid (PA), cause insulin resistance in endothelium characterized by a decreased synthesis of insulin-mediated vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), and by an increased production of the vasoconstrictor protein, endothelin-1. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that anthocyanins, natural phenols commonly present in food and vegetables from Mediterranean Diet, exert significant cardiovascular health-promoting activities. These effects are possibly mediated by a positive regulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 and activation of cellular antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. The present study examined, at a molecular level, the effects of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a widely distributed anthocyanin, on PA-induced endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results indicate that C3G pretreatment effectively reverses the effects of PA on PI3K/Akt axis, and restores eNOS expression and NO release, altered by PA. We observed that these effects were exerted by changes on the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on specific serine and tyrosine residues modulated by PA through the modulation of JNK and IKK activity. Furthermore, silencing Nrf2 transcripts demonstrated that the protective effects of C3G are directly related to the activation of Nrf2.

Abstract: Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) is one of the most important mechanisms for calcium mobilization in to the cell. Two main proteins sustain SOCE: STIM1 that acts as the calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Orai1 responsible for calcium influx upon depletion of ER. There are many studies indicating that SOCE is modulated by the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane (PM). However, a myriad of questions remain unanswered concerning the precise molecular mechanism by which cholesterol modulates SOCE. In the present study we found that reducing PM cholesterol results in the internalization of Orai1 channels, which can be prevented by overexpressing caveolin 1 (Cav1). Furthermore, Cav1 and Orai1 associate upon SOCE activation as revealed by FRET and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The effects of reducing cholesterol were not limited to an increased rate of Orai1 internalization, but also, affects the lateral movement of Orai1, inducing movement in a linear pattern (unobstructed diffusion) opposite to basal cholesterol conditions were most of Orai1 channels moves in a confined space, as assessed by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, Cav1 overexpression inhibited these alterations maintaining Orai1 into a confined and partially confined movement. These results not only highlight the complex effect of cholesterol regulation on SOCE, but also indicate a direct regulatory effect on Orai1 localization and compartmentalization by this lipid.

Abstract: Myostatin (Mstn) deficiency leads to skeletal muscle overgrowth and Mstn inhibition is considered as a promising treatment for muscle-wasting disorders. Mstn gene deletion in mice also causes metabolic changes with decreased mitochondria content, disturbance in mitochondrial respiratory function and increased muscle fatigability. However the impact of MSTN deficiency on these metabolic changes is not fully elucidated. Here, we hypothesized that lack of MSTN will alter skeletal muscle membrane lipid composition in relation with pronounced alterations in muscle function and metabolism. Indeed, phospholipids and in particular cardiolipin mostly present in the inner mitochondrial membrane, play a crucial role in mitochondria function and oxidative phosphorylation process. We observed that Mstn KO muscle had reduced fat membrane transporter levels (FAT/CD36, FABP3, FATP1 and FATP4) associated with decreased lipid oxidative pathway (citrate synthase and β-HAD activities) and impaired lipogenesis (decreased triglyceride and free fatty acid content), indicating a role of mstn in muscle lipid metabolism. We further analyzed phospholipid classes and fatty acid composition by chromatographic methods in muscle and mitochondrial membranes. Mstn KO mice showed increased levels of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids. We also demonstrated, in this phenotype, a reduction in cardiolipin proportion in mitochondrial membrane versus the proportion of others phospholipids, in relation with a decrease in the expression of phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase and cardiolipin synthase, enzymes involved in cardiolipin synthesis. These data illustrate the importance of lipids as a link by which MSTN deficiency can impact mitochondrial bioenergetics in skeletal muscle.

Abstract: Sphingolipids have been implicated in age-related neurodegeneration. Previous studies have reported elevated ceramide levels in the brain of old rodents, but a systematic investigation of the impact of age on brain sphingolipid metabolism is still lacking. Here we quantified 17 key sphingolipid species in the hippocampus of young (3months), middle-aged (12months) and old (21months) male and female mice. Lipids were extracted and quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; transcription of enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis was evaluated by qPCR. Age-dependent changes of multiple sphingolipid species - including ceramide (d18:1/18:0), sphingomyelin (d34:1), hexosylceramide (d18:1/16:0), ceramide (d18:1/24:0) - were found in mice of both sexes. Moreover, sex-dependent changes were seen with hexosylceramide (d18:1/18:0), ceramide (d18:1/22:0), sphingomyelin (d36:1) and sphingomyelin (d42:1). Importantly, an age-dependent accumulation of sphingolipids containing nervonic acid (24:1) was observed in 21month-old male (p=0.04) and female mice (p<0.0001). Consistent with this increase, transcription of the nervonic acid-synthesizing enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1 and Scd2), was upregulated in 21month-old female mice (Scd1 p=0.006; Scd2 p=0.009); a similar trend was observed in males (Scd1 p=0.07). In conclusion, the results suggest that aging is associated with profound sex-dependent and -independent changes in hippocampal sphingolipid profile. The results also highlight the need to examine the contribution of sphingolipids, and particularly of those containing nervonic acid, in normal and pathological brain aging.

Abstract: The cDNA encoding human gastric lipase (HGL) was integrated into the genome of Pichia pastoris using the pGAPZα A transfer vector. The HGL signal peptide was replaced by the yeast α-factor to achieve an efficient secretion. Active rHGL was produced by the transformed yeast but its levels and stability were dependent on the pH. The highest activity was obtained upon buffering the culture medium at pH5, a condition that allowed preserving enzyme activity over time. A large fraction (72±2%) of secreted rHGL remained however bound to the yeast cells, and was released by washing the cell pellet with an acid glycine-HCl buffer (pH2.2). This procedure allowed establishing a first step of purification that was completed by size exclusion chromatography. N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry revealed that rHGL was produced in its mature form, with a global mass of 50,837±32Da corresponding to a N-glycosylated form of HGL polypeptide (43,193Da). rHGL activity was characterized as a function of pH, various substrates and in the presence of bile salts and pepsin, and was found similar to native HGL, except for slight changes in pH optima. We then studied by site-directed mutagenesis the role of three key residues (K4, E225, R229) involved in salt bridges stabilizing the lid domain that controls the access to the active site and is part of the interfacial recognition site. Their substitution has an impact on the pH-dependent activity of rHGL and its relative activities on medium and long chain triglycerides.

Abstract: The Melanocortin 5 Receptor (MC5R) is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which comprises an intracellular carboxylic domain, seven transmembrane helices and an extracellular amino terminal. Over the last few years, MC5R has been implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism in exocrine glands, muscle and even in adipose tissue and its function is quite dependent on its correct cell membrane targeting. In this context, the purpose of this work was to study the role of MC5R N-terminus in the receptor trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Analysis of N-terminal deleted forms of MC5R revealed that the first 21 amino acids contain the information responsible for the receptor cell surface expression and the removal of further amino acids interfere with the receptor synthesis. In this setting, several mutant forms of the receptor were created by site directed mutagenesis of the MC5R first 21 amino acids and their presence at the plasma membrane was assessed. We have found that two small motifs, constituted by residues Ser4/Ser5 and Ser17/Glu18, are clearly involved in the correct targeting of MC5R to the cell surface. Fluorescence microscopy analysis has revealed that MC5R constructs with mutations in those residues are mainly retained at the ER/Golgi complex. Furthermore, the homodimerization ability of the receptor is maintained in these mutant forms, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the anterograde transport of MC5R by those N-terminal domains.

Abstract: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid known to be neuroprotective in several models of human diseases, including multiple sclerosis. The protective effects of DHA are largely attributed to its ability to interfere with the activity of transcription factors controlling immune and inflammatory responses, including the agonist-dependent transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ). In this study, we used primary oligodendrocyte progenitor (OP) cultures from neonatal rat brain to investigate whether DHA could influence OP maturation and directly promote myelination, as previously reported for selective PPAR-γ agonists. We show that, similarly to the selective PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone (PGZ), DHA promotes OP maturation and counteracts the maturational arrest induced by TNF-α, used to mimic inflammatory conditions. The PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662 prevented both DHA-induced OP maturation and PPAR-γ nuclear translocation, supporting the hypothesis that DHA acts through the activation of PPAR-γ. In addition, both PGZ and DHA induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated-kinase 1–2 (ERK1/2), in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner. ERK1/2 activity is known to regulate the transition from OPs to immature oligodendrocytes and the presence of specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (U0126 or PD98059) prevented the differentiating effects of both DHA and PGZ. These results indicate that DHA might influence the process of OP maturation through its PPAR-γ agonistic activity and provide novel molecular mechanisms for the action of this dietary fatty acid, further supporting the nutritional intervention in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Abstract: Sterol intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway have drawn attention for novel biological activities. Follicular fluid meiosis activating sterol (FF-MAS) is a LXRα ligand and a potential modulator of physiologic processes regulated by nuclear receptors, such as lipid homeostasis and cell proliferation. In this work, we established a model to selectively accumulate FF-MAS in HepG2 cells, by using a combination of the inhibitors AY9944 and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to block C14-sterol reductases and the downstream C4-demethylase complex. We investigated the effects produced by altered levels of cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates, in order to dissect their influence on LXRα signaling. In particular, endogenously accumulated FF-MAS was able to modulate the expression of key genes in cholesterol metabolism, to activate LXRα nuclear signaling resulting in increased lipogenesis, and to inhibit HepG2 cells proliferation. Moreover, a fluorescent ester derivative of FF-MAS localized in nuclear lipid droplets, suggesting a role for these organelles in the storage of signaling lipids interacting with nuclear partners.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides are rapidly turning-over phospholipids that play key roles in intracellular signaling and modulation of membrane effectors. Through technical refinements we have improved sensitivity in the analysis of the phosphoinositide PI, PIP, and PIP2 pools from living cells using mass spectrometry. This has permitted further resolution in phosphoinositide lipidomics from cell cultures and small samples of tissue. The technique includes butanol extraction, derivatization of the lipids, post-column infusion of sodium to stabilize formation of sodiated adducts, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, achieving a detection limit of 20pg. We describe the spectrum of fatty-acyl chains in the cellular phosphoinositides. Consistent with previous work in other mammalian primary cells, the 38:4 fatty-acyl chains dominate in the phosphoinositides of the pineal gland and of superior cervical ganglia, and many additional fatty acid combinations are found at low abundance. However, Chinese hamster ovary cells and human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201) in culture have different fatty-acyl chain profiles that change with growth state. Their 38:4 lipids lose their dominance as cultures approach confluence. The method has good time resolution and follows well the depletion in <20s of both PIP2 and PIP that results from strong activation of Gq-coupled receptors. The receptor-activated phospholipase C exhibits no substrate selectivity among the various fatty-acyl chain combinations.

Abstract: Palmitate triggers inflammatory responses in several cell types, but its effects on cardiac fibroblasts are at present unknown. The aims of the study were to (1) assess the potential of palmitate to promote inflammatory signaling in cardiac fibroblasts through TLR4 and the NLRP3 inflammasome and (2) characterize the cellular phenotype of cardiac fibroblasts exposed to palmitate. We examined whether palmitate induces inflammatory responses in cardiac fibroblasts from WT, NLRP3−/− and ASC−/−mice (C57BL/6 background). Exposure to palmitate caused production of TNF, IL-6 and CXCL2 via TLR4 activation. NLRP3 inflammasomes are activated in a two-step manner. Whereas palmitate did not prime the NLRP3 inflammasome, it induced activation in LPS-primed cardiac fibroblasts as indicated by IL-1β, IL-18 production and NLRP3-ASC co-localization. Palmitate-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed cardiac fibroblasts was associated with reduced AMPK activity, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial dysfunction. The cardiac fibroblast phenotype caused by palmitate, in an LPS and NLRP3 independent manner, was characterized by decreased cellular proliferation, contractility, collagen and MMP-2 expression, as well as increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and consistent with a state of cellular senescence. This study establishes that in vitro palmitate exposure of cardiac fibroblasts provides inflammatory responses via TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Palmitate also modulates cardiac fibroblast functionality, in a NLRP3 independent manner, resulting in a phenotype related to cellular senescence. These effects of palmitate could be of importance for myocardial dysfunction in obese and diabetic patients.

Abstract: Human monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a membrane-interacting enzyme that generates pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. For this reason, MAGL inhibition is a promising strategy to treat pain, cancer, and neuroinflammatory diseases. MAGL can hydrolyze monoacylglycerols bearing an acyl chain of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation, cleaving primarily the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Importantly, the enzymatic binding site of MAGL is confined by a 75-amino-acid-long, flexible cap domain, named ‘lid domain’, which is structurally similar to that found in several other lipases. However, it is unclear how lid domain plasticity affects catalysis in MAGL. By integrating extensive molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations with mutagenesis and kinetic experiments, we here define a lid-domain-mediated mechanism for substrate selection and binding in MAGL catalysis. In particular, we clarify the key role of Phe159 and Ile179, two conserved residues within the lid domain, in regulating substrate specificity in MAGL. We conclude by proposing that other structurally related lipases may share this lid-domain-mediated mechanism for substrate specificity.

Abstract: In vitro studies suggest that liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and sterol carrier protein-2/sterol carrier protein-x (SCP2/SCPx) gene products facilitate uptake and metabolism and detoxification of dietary-derived phytol in mammals. However, concomitant upregulation of L-FABP in SCP2/SCPx null mice complicates interpretation of their physiological phenotype. Therefore, the impact of ablating both the L-FABP gene and SCP2/SCPx gene (L-FABP/SCP2/SCPx null or TKO) was examined in phytol-fed female wild-type (WT) and TKO mice. TKO increased hepatic total lipid accumulation, primarily phospholipid, by mechanisms involving increased hepatic levels of proteins in the phospholipid synthetic pathway. Concomitantly, TKO reduced expression of proteins in targeting fatty acids towards the triacylglycerol synthetic pathway. Increased hepatic lipid accumulation was not associated with any concomitant upregulation of membrane fatty acid transport/translocase proteins involved in fatty acid uptake (FATP2, FATP4, FATP5 or GOT) or cytosolic proteins involved in fatty acid intracellular targeting (ACBP). In addition, TKO exacerbated dietary phytol-induced whole body weight loss, especially lean tissue mass. Since individually ablating SCPx or SCP2/SCPx elicited concomitant upregulation of L-FABP, these findings with TKO mice help to resolve the contributions of SCP2/SCPx gene ablation on dietary phytol-induced whole body and hepatic lipid phenotype independent of concomitant upregulation of L-FABP.

Abstract: Among several virulence factors produced by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), a recently identified novel class of dihydroceramide lipids that contains a long acyl-chain has the potential to play a pathogenic role in periodontitis because of its higher level of tissue penetration compared to other lipid classes produced by Pg. However, the possible impact of Pg ceramides on osteoclastogenesis is largely unknown. In the present study, we report that the phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PGDHC) isolated from Pg enhanced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using RAW264.7 cells, in vitro assays indicated that PGDHC can promote RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by generating remarkably larger TRAP+ multinuclear osteoclasts compared to Pg LPS in a TLR2/4-independent manner. According to fluorescent confocal microscopy, co-localization of non-muscle myosin II-A (Myh9) and PGDHC was observed in the cytoplasm of osteoclasts, indicating the membrane-permeability of PGDHC. Loss- and gain-of-function assays using RNAi-based Myh9 gene silencing, as well as overexpression of the Myh9 gene, in RAW264.7 cells showed that interaction of PGDHC with Myh9 enhances RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. It was also demonstrated that PGDHC can upregulate the expression of dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), an important osteoclast fusogen, through signaling that involves Rac1, suggesting that interaction of PGDHC with Myh9 can elicit the cell signal that promotes osteoclast cell fusion. Taken together, our data indicated that PGDHC is a Pg-derived, cell-permeable ceramide that possesses a unique property of promoting osteoclastogenesis via interaction with Myh9 which, in turn, activates a Rac1/DC-STAMP pathway for upregulation of osteoclast cell fusion.

Abstract: The acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) plays a key role in chaperoning long-chain acyl-CoAs into lipid metabolic processes and acts as an important regulatory hub in mammalian physiology. This is highlighted by the recent finding that mice devoid of ACBP suffer from a compromised epidermal barrier and delayed weaning, the physiological process where newborns transit from a fat-based milk diet to a carbohydrate-rich diet. To gain insights into how ACBP impinges on weaning and the concomitant remodeling of whole-body lipid metabolism we performed a comparative lipidomics analysis charting the absolute abundance of 613 lipid molecules in liver, muscle and plasma from weaning and adult Acbp knockout and wild type mice. Our results reveal that ACBP deficiency affects primarily lipid metabolism of liver and plasma during weaning. Specifically, we show that ACBP deficient mice have elevated levels of hepatic cholesteryl esters, and that lipids featuring an 18:1 fatty acid moiety are increased in Acbp depleted mice across all tissues investigated. Our results also show that the perturbation of systemic lipid metabolism in Acbp knockout mice is transient and becomes normalized and similar to that of wild type as mice grow older. These findings demonstrate that ACBP serves crucial functions in maintaining lipid metabolic homeostasis in mice during weaning.

Abstract: The fungus Corynespora cassiicola metabolises exogenous steroids in a unique and highly specific manner. Central to this, is the ability of this organism to functionalise substrates (androgens, progestogens) at the highly stereochemically hindered 8β-position of the steroid nucleus. A recent study has identified that 8β-hydroxylation occurs through inverted binding in a 9α-hydroxylase. In order to discern the metabolic fate of more symmetrical molecules, we have investigated the metabolism of a range of steroidal analogues functionalised with ring-D lactones, but differing in their functional group stereochemistry at carbon-3. Remarkably, the 3α-functionalised steroidal lactones underwent a mechanistically unique two step intramolecular cyclisation resulting in the generation of a ring-D spiro-carbolactone. This rapid rearrangement initiated with hydroxylation at carbon 14 followed by transesterification, resulting in ring contraction with formation of a butyrolactone at carbon-14. Remarkably this rearrangement was found to be highly dependent on the stereochemistry at carbon-3, with the β-analogues only undergoing 9α-hydroxylation. The implications of these findings and their mechanistic bases are discussed.

Abstract: Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), is a well-known transcriptional regulator of cholesterol metabolism. SREBP-2 is activated unconventionally to promote excessive cholesterol accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, recent studies suggested that excessive lipid and cholesterol accumulation can weaken cellular autophagy function and promote endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). However, it remains unknown whether regulation of SREBP-2 processing modulates autophagy and ERS. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of SREBP-2 intracellular trafficking by site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) specific inhibitors, or shRNAs targeting S1P and S2P, upregulated gene and protein expression of autophagy markers, and improved the impaired autophagic flux induced in both cell and mouse models of NAFLD. Furthermore, increased lipid degradation by autophagy could repress PERK-P-EIF2α signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that regulating the nuclear transport of SREBP-2 reduces lipid deposition and ERS via an autophagy-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the small intestine, mediate efficient absorption of dietary fat (triacylglycerol, TAG). The digestive products of dietary fat are taken up by enterocytes, re-esterified into TAG, and packaged on chylomicrons (CMs) for secretion into blood or temporarily stored within cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs). Altered enterocyte TAG distribution impacts susceptibility to high fat diet associated diseases, but molecular mechanisms directing TAG toward these fates are unclear. Two enzymes, acyl CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1) and Dgat2, catalyze the final, committed step of TAG synthesis within enterocytes. Mice with intestine-specific overexpression of Dgat1 (Dgat1Int) or Dgat2 (Dgat2Int), or lack of Dgat1 (Dgat1−/−), were previously found to have altered intestinal TAG secretion and storage. We hypothesized that varying intestinal Dgat1 and Dgat2 levels alters TAG distribution in subcellular pools for CM synthesis as well as the morphology and proteome of CLDs. To test this we used ultrastructural and proteomic methods to investigate intracellular TAG distribution and CLD-associated proteins in enterocytes from Dgat1Int, Dgat2Int, and Dgat1−/− mice 2h after a 200μl oral olive oil gavage. We found that varying levels of intestinal Dgat1 and Dgat2 altered TAG pools involved in CM assembly and secretion, the number or size of CLDs present in enterocytes, and the enterocyte CLD proteome. Overall, these results support a model where Dgat1 and Dgat2 function coordinately to regulate the process of dietary fat absorption by preferentially synthesizing TAG for incorporation into distinct subcellular TAG pools in enterocytes.

Abstract: Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins (FABPs) are abundant intracellular proteins that bind long chain fatty acids (FA) and have been related with inmunometabolic diseases. Intestinal epithelial cells express two isoforms of FABPs: liver FABP (LFABP or FABP1) and intestinal FABP (IFABP or FABP2). They are thought to be associated with intracellular dietary lipid transport and trafficking towards diverse cell fates. But still their specific functions are not well understood. To study FABP1's functions, we generated an FABP1 knockdown model in Caco-2 cell line by stable antisense cDNA transfection (FABP1as). In these cells FABP1 expression was reduced up to 87%. No compensatory increase in FABP2 was observed, strengthening the idea of differential functions of both isoforms. In differentiated FABP1as cells, apical administration of oleate showed a decrease in its initial uptake rate and in long term incorporation compared with control cells. FABP1 depletion also reduced basolateral oleate secretion. The secreted oleate distribution showed an increase in FA/triacylglyceride ratio compared to control cells, probably due to FABP1's role in chylomicron assembly. Interestingly, FABP1as cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in proliferation rate. A reduction in oleate uptake as well as a decrease in its incorporation into the phospholipid fraction was observed in proliferating cells. Overall, our studies indicate that FABP1 is essential for proper lipid metabolism in differentiated enterocytes, particularly concerning fatty acids uptake and its basolateral secretion. Moreover, we show that FABP1 is required for enterocyte proliferation, suggesting that it may contribute to intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Since its discovery 75years ago, a wealth of knowledge has accumulated on the role of cardiolipin, the hallmark phospholipid of mitochondria, in bioenergetics and particularly on the structural organization of the inner mitochondrial membrane. A surge of interest in this anionic doubly-charged tetra-acylated lipid found in both prokaryotes and mitochondria has emerged based on its newly discovered signaling functions. Cardiolipin displays organ, tissue, cellular and transmembrane distribution asymmetries. A collapse of the membrane asymmetry represents a pro-mitophageal mechanism whereby externalized cardiolipin acts as an “eat-me” signal. Oxidation of cardiolipin's polyunsaturated acyl chains - catalyzed by cardiolipin complexes with cytochrome c. - is a pro-apoptotic signal. The messaging functions of myriads of cardiolipin species and their oxidation products are now being recognized as important intracellular and extracellular signals for innate and adaptive immune systems. This newly developing field of research exploring cardiolipin signaling is the main subject of this review. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the aromatic moiety of Tyr143 within the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) region of the prostaglandin EP2 receptor plays a crucial role in Gs coupling. Here we investigated whether the ICL2 of the EP2 receptor directly binds to Gαs and whether an aromatic moiety affects this interaction. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, mutations of Tyr143 reduced the ability of the EP2 receptor to interact with G proteins as demonstrated by GTPγS sensitivity, as well as the ability of agonist-induced cAMP formation, with the rank order of Phe>Tyr (wild-type)=Trp>Leu>Ala (=0). We found that the wild-type ICL2 peptide (i2Y) and its mutant with Phe at Tyr143 (i2F) inhibited receptor-G protein complex formation of wild-type EP2 in membranes, whereas the Ala-substituted mutant (i2A) did not. Specific interactions between these peptides and the Gαs protein were detected by surface plasmon resonance, but Gαs showed different association rates, with a rank order of i2F>i2Y≫i2A, with similar dissociation rates. Moreover, i2F and i2Y, but not i2A activated membrane adenylyl cyclase. These results indicate that the ICL2 region of the EP2 receptor is its potential interaction site with Gαs, and that the aromatic side chain moiety at position 143 is a determinant for the accessibility of the ICL2 to the Gαs protein.

Small heterodimer partner (SHP) contributes to insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes,

Abstract: Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical nuclear receptor expressed in heart that has been shown to inhibit the hypertrophic response. Here, we assessed the role of SHP in cardiac metabolism and inflammation. Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) displayed glucose intolerance accompanied by increased cardiac mRNA levels of Shp. In HL-1 cardiomyocytes, SHP overexpression inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and impaired the insulin signalling pathway (evidenced by reduced AKT and AS160 phosphorylation), similar to insulin resistant cells generated by high palmitate/high insulin treatment (HP/HI; 500μM/100nM). In addition, SHP overexpression increased Socs3 mRNA and reduced IRS-1 protein levels. SHP overexpression also induced Cd36 expression (~6.2 fold; p<0.001) linking to the observed intramyocellular lipid accumulation. SHP overexpressing cells further showed altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, i.e., Acaca, Acadvl or Ucp3, augmented NF-κB DNA-binding activity and induced transcripts of inflammatory genes, i.e., Il6 and Tnf mRNA (~4-fold induction, p<0.01). Alterations in metabolism and inflammation found in SHP overexpressing cells were associated with changes in the mRNA levels of Ppara (79% reduction, p<0.001) and Pparg (~58-fold induction, p<0.001). Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP overexpression strongly reduced the physical interaction between PPARα and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, suggesting that dissociation of these two proteins is one of the mechanisms by which SHP initiates the inflammatory response in cardiac cells. Overall, our results suggest that SHP upregulation upon high-fat feeding leads to lipid accumulation, insulin resistance and inflammation in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: In this study we provide the first evidence of the interaction of a truncated-TRAF2 with lipid raft microdomains. We have analyzed this interaction by measuring the diffusion coefficient of the protein in large and giant unilamellar vesicles (LUVs and GUVs, respectively) obtained both from synthetic lipid mixtures and from natural extracts. Steady-state fluorescence measurements performed with synthetic vesicles indicate that this truncated form of TRAF2 displays a tighter binding to raft-like LUVs with respect to the control (POPC-containing LUVs), and that this process depends on the protein oligomeric state. Generalized Polarization measurements and spectral phasor analysis revealed that truncated-TRAF2 affects the membrane fluidity, especially when vesicles are heated up at physiological temperature. The addition of nanomolar concentration of TRAF2 in GUVs also seems to exert a mechanical action, as demonstrated by the formation of intraluminal vesicles, a process in which ganglioside GM1 plays a crucial role.

Abstract: N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) such as N-palmitoylethanolamine and anandamide are endogenous bioactive lipids having numerous functions, including the control of inflammation. Their levels and therefore actions can be controlled by modulating the activity of two hydrolytic enzymes, N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). As macrophages are key to inflammatory processes, we used lipopolysaccharide-activated J774 macrophages, as well as primary mouse alveolar macrophages, to study the effect of FAAH and NAAA inhibition, using PF-3845 and AM9053 respectively, on macrophage activation and NAE levels measured by HPLC-MS. Markers of macrophage activation were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Activation of macrophages decreased NAAA expression and NAE hydrolytic activity. FAAH and NAAA inhibition increased the levels of the different NAEs, although with different magnitudes, whether in control condition or following LPS-induced macrophage activation. Both inhibitors reduced several markers of macrophage activation, such as mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, as well as cytokine and prostaglandin production, with however some differences between FAAH and NAAA inhibition. Most of the NAEs tested – including N-docosatetraenoylethanolamine and N-docosahexaenoylethanolamine – also reduced LPS-induced mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, again with differences depending on the marker and the NAE, thus offering a potential explanation for the differential effect of the inhibitors on macrophage activation markers. In conclusion, we show different and complementary effects of NAE on lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage activation. Our results support an important role for inhibition of NAE hydrolysis and NAAA inhibition in particular in controlling macrophage activation, and thus inflammation.

Abstract: Ecto-F1-ATPase is a complex related to mitochondrial ATP synthase which has been identified as a plasma membrane receptor for apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and has been shown to contribute to HDL endocytosis in several cell types. On hepatocytes, apoA-I binding to ecto-F1-ATPase stimulates extracellular ATP hydrolysis into ADP, which subsequently activates a P2Y13-mediated HDL endocytosis pathway. Interestingly, other mitochondrial proteins have been found to be expressed at the plasma membrane of several cell types. Among these, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is an ADP/ATP carrier but its role in controlling extracellular ADP levels and F1-ATPase-mediated HDL endocytosis has never been investigated. Here we confirmed the presence of ANT at the plasma membrane of human hepatocytes. We then showed that ecto-ANT activity increases or reduces extracellular ADP level, depending on the extracellular ADP/ATP ratio. Interestingly, ecto-ANT co-localized with ecto-F1-ATPase at the hepatocyte plasma membrane and pharmacological inhibition of ecto-ANT activity increased extracellular ADP level when ecto-F1-ATPase was activated by apoA-I. This increase in the bioavailability of extracellular ADP accordingly translated into an increase of HDL endocytosis on human hepatocytes. This study thus uncovered a new location and function of ANT for which activity at the cell surface of hepatocytes modulates the concentration of extracellular ADP and regulates HDL endocytosis.

Abstract: During the past decades, high-throughput approaches for analyzing different molecular classes such as nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, and lipids have grown rapidly. These approaches became powerful tools for getting a fundamental understanding of biological systems. Considering each approach and its results separately, relations and causal connections between these classes have no chance to be revealed, since only separate molecular snapshots are provided. Only a combined approach, not fully established yet, with the integration of the corresponding data, might yield a comprehensive and complete understanding of biological processes, such as crosstalk and interactions in signaling pathways. Taking two or more omics-methods into consideration for analysis is referred to as a multi-omics approach, which is gradually evolving. In this critical note, we briefly discuss the relevance, challenges, current state, and potential of data integration from multi-omics approaches, with a special focus on lipidomics analysis, listing the advantages and gaps in this field.

Abstract: Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in hepatocytes is a typical character of steatosis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, one of the risk factors related to steatosis, induced LD accumulation in cultured cells. However, the mechanisms of which HCV induce LD formation are not fully revealed. Previously we identified cytosolic phospholipase A2 gamma (PLA2G4C) as a host factor upregulated by HCV infection and involved in HCV replication. Here we further revealed that PLA2G4C plays an important role in LD biogenesis and refined the functional analysis of PLA2G4C in LD biogenesis and HCV assembly. LD formation upon fatty acid and HCV stimulation in PLA2G4C knockdown cells was impaired and could not be restored by complementation with PLA2G4A. PLA2G4C was tightly associated in the membrane with the domain around the amino acid residues 260–292, normally in ER but relocated into LDs upon oleate stimulation. Mutant PLA2G4C without enzymatic activity was not able to restore LD formation in PLA2G4C knockdown cells. Thus, both the membrane attachment and the enzymatic activity of PLA2G4C were required for its function in LD formation. The participation of PLA2G4C in LD formation is correlated with its involvement in HCV assembly. Finally, PLA2G4C overexpression itself led to LD formation in hepatic cells and enhanced LD accumulation in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, suggesting its potential role in fatty liver disease.

Abstract: Secreted LOX from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-LOX) has previously been identified as arachidonic acid 15S-lipoxygenating enzyme. Here we report that the substitution of Ala420Gly in PA-LOX leads to an enzyme variant with pronounced dual specificity favoring arachidonic acid 11R-oxygenation. When compared with other LOX-isoforms the molecular oxygen affinity of wild-type PA-LOX is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower (Km O2 of 0.4mM) but Ala420Gly exchange improved the molecular oxygen affinity (Km O2 of 0.2mM). Experiments with stereo-specifically deuterated linoleic acid indicated that the formation of both 13S- and 9R-HpODE involves abstraction of the proS-hydrogen from C11 of the fatty acid backbone. To explore the structural basis for the observed functional changes (altered specificity, improved molecular oxygen affinity) we solved the crystal structure of the Ala420Gly mutant of PA-LOX at 1.8Å resolution and compared it with the wild-type enzyme. Modeling of fatty acid alignment at the catalytic center suggested that in the wild-type enzyme dioxygen is directed to C15 of arachidonic acid by a protein tunnel, which interconnects the catalytic center with the protein surface. Ala420Gly exchange redirects intra-enzyme O2 diffusion by bifurcating this tunnel so that C11 of arachidonic acid also becomes accessible for O2 insertion.

Abstract: Neurospora crassa, a filamentous fungus, in the unicellular conidial stage has ideal features to study sphingolipid (SL)-enriched domains, which are implicated in fundamental cellular processes ranging from antifungal resistance to apoptosis. Several changes in lipid metabolism and in the membrane composition of N. crassa occur during spore germination. However, the biophysical impact of those changes is unknown. Thus, a biophysical study of N. crassa plasma membrane, particularly SL-enriched domains, and their dynamics along conidial germination is prompted. Two N. crassa strains, wild-type (WT) and slime, which is devoid of cell wall, were studied. Conidial growth of N. crassa WT from a dormancy state to an exponential phase was accompanied by membrane reorganization, namely an increase of membrane fluidity, occurring faster in a supplemented medium than in Vogel's minimal medium. Gel-like domains, likely enriched in SLs, were found in both N. crassa strains, but were particularly compact, rigid and abundant in the case of slime cells, even more than in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In N. crassa, our results suggest that the melting of SL-enriched domains occurs near growth temperature (30°C) for WT, but at higher temperatures for slime. Regarding biophysical properties strongly affected by ergosterol, the plasma membrane of slime conidia lays in between those of N. crassa WT and S. cerevisiae cells. The differences in biophysical properties found in this work, and the relationships established between membrane lipid composition and dynamics, give new insights about the plasma membrane organization and structure of N. crassa strains during conidial growth.

Abstract: Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, can build up to dangerous levels in refrigerated foods potentially leading to expensive product recalls. An important aspect of the bacterium's growth at low temperatures is its ability to increase the branched-chain fatty acid anteiso C15:0 content of its membrane at lower growth temperatures, which imparts greater membrane fluidity. Mutants in the branched-chain α-keto dehydrogenase (bkd) complex are deficient in branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs,) but these can be restored by feeding C4 and C5 branched-chain carboxylic acids (BCCAs). This suggests the presence of an alternate pathway for production of acyl CoA precursors for fatty acid biosynthesis. We hypothesize that the alternate pathway is composed of butyrate kinase (buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (ptb) encoded in the bkd complex which produce acyl CoA products by their sequential action through the metabolism of carboxylic acids. We determined the steady state kinetics of recombinant His-tagged Buk using 11 different straight-chain and BCCA substrates in the acyl phosphate forming direction. Buk demonstrated highest catalytic efficiency with pentanoate as the substrate. Low product formation observed with acetate (C2) and hexanoate (C6) as the substrates indicates that Buk is not involved in either acetate metabolism or long chain carboxylic acid activation. We were also able to show that Buk catalysis occurs through a ternary complex intermediate. Additionally, Buk demonstrates a strong preference for BCCAs at low temperatures. These results indicate that Buk may be involved in the activation and assimilation of exogenous carboxylic acids for membrane fatty acid biosynthesis.

Abstract: Statins have been proven to be effective in treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, it was reported that statins decreased the hepatic expression of perilipin 5 (Plin5), a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, which plays critical roles in regulating lipid accumulation and lipolysis in liver. However, the function and regulation mechanism of Plin5 have not yet been well-established in NAFLD treatment with statins. In this study, we observed that atorvastatin moderately reduced the expression of Plin5 in livers without changing the protein level of Plin5 in the hepatic LD fraction of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Intriguingly, atorvastatin stimulated the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Plin5 and reduced the triglyceride (TG) accumulation in hepatocytes with overexpression of wide type (Plin5-WT) compared to serine-155 mutant Plin5 (Plin5-S155A). Moreover, PKA-stimulated FA release of purified LDs carrying Plin5-WT but not Plin5-S155A. Glucagon, a PKA activator, stimulated the phosphorylation of Plin5-WT and inhibited its interaction with CGI-58. The results indicated that atorvastatin promoted lipolysis and reduced TG accumulation in the liver by increasing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Plin5. This new mechanism of lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin might provide a new strategy for NAFLD treatment.

Abstract: Although white adipose tissue (WAT) stores triglycerides and contributes to obesity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy as heat. Therefore, browning of WAT is regarded as an attractive way to counteract obesity. Our previous studies have revealed that treatment with cryptotanshinone (CT) during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells inhibits their differentiation. Here, we found that pretreatment of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells with CT before exposure to adipogenic hormonal stimuli promotes the commitment of these mesenchymal stem cells to the adipocyte lineage as confirmed by increased triglyceride accumulation. Furthermore, CT treatment induced the expression of early B-cell factor 2 (Ebf2) and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (Bmp7), which are known to drive differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells toward preadipocytes and to the commitment to brown adipocytes. Consequently, CT treatment yielded brown-adipocyte-like features as evidenced by elevated expression of brown-fat signature genes including Ucp1, Prdm16, Pgc-1α, Cidea, Zic1, and beige-cell-specific genes such as CD137, Hspb7, Cox2, and Tmem26. Additionally, CT treatment induced mitochondrial biogenesis through upregulation of Sirt1, Tfam, Nrf1, and Cox7a and increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Our data also showed that cotreatment with CT and BMP4 was more effective at activating brown-adipocyte-specific genes. Mechanistic experiments revealed that treatment with CT activated AMPKα and p38-MAPK via their phosphorylation: the two major signaling pathways regulating energy metabolism. Thus, these findings suggest that CT is a candidate therapeutic agent against obesity working via activation of browning and mitochondrial biogenesis in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells.

Abstract: 2-Hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase (HACL1) is a key enzyme of the peroxisomal α-oxidation of phytanic acid. To better understand its role in health and disease, a mouse model lacking HACL1 was investigated. Under normal conditions, these mice did not display a particular phenotype. However, upon dietary administration of phytol, phytanic acid accumulated in tissues, mainly in liver and serum of KO mice. As a consequence of phytanic acid (or a metabolite) toxicity, KO mice displayed a significant weight loss, absence of abdominal white adipose tissue, enlarged and mottled liver and reduced hepatic glycogen and triglycerides. In addition, hepatic PPARα was activated. The central nervous system of the phytol-treated mice was apparently not affected. In addition, 2OH-FA did not accumulate in the central nervous system of HACL1 deficient mice, likely due to the presence in the endoplasmic reticulum of an alternate HACL1-unrelated lyase. The latter may serve as a backup system in certain tissues and account for the formation of pristanic acid in the phytol-fed KO mice. As the degradation of pristanic acid is also impaired, both phytanoyl- and pristanoyl-CoA levels are increased in liver, and the ω-oxidized metabolites are excreted in urine. In conclusion, HACL1 deficiency is not associated with a severe phenotype, but in combination with phytanic acid intake, the normal situation in man, it might present with phytanic acid elevation and resemble a Refsum like disorder.

ANGPTL4 promotes bile acid absorption during taurocholic acid supplementation via a mechanism dependent on the gut microbiota,

Abstract: Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) raises plasma triglyceride levels by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase. A set of compounds that are able to reduce plasma triglyceride levels are bile acids (BA). Because BA have been shown to decrease ANGPTL4 secretion by intestinal cells, we hypothesized that BA lower plasma triglycerides (partly) via ANGPTL4. To test that hypothesis, wild-type and Angptl4−/− mice were fed chow supplemented with taurocholic acid (TCA) for seven days. TCA supplementation effectively lowered plasma triglycerides in wild-type and Angptl4−/− mice, indicating that ANGPTL4 is not required for plasma triglyceride-lowering by BA. Intriguingly, however, plasma and hepatic BA concentrations were significantly lower in TCA-supplemented Angptl4−/− mice than in TCA-supplemented wild-type mice. These changes in the Angptl4−/− mice were accompanied by lower BA levels in ileal scrapings and decreased expression of FXR-target genes in the ileum, including the BA transporter Slc10a2. By contrast, faecal excretion of specifically primary BA was higher in the Angptl4−/− mice, suggesting that loss of ANGPTL4 impairs intestinal BA absorption. Since the gut microbiota converts primary BA into secondary BA, elevated excretion of primary BA in Angptl4−/− mice may reflect differences in gut microbial composition and/or functionality. Indeed, colonic microbial composition was markedly different between Angptl4−/− and wild-type mice. Suppression of the gut bacteria using antibiotics abolished differences in plasma, hepatic, and faecal BA levels between TCA-supplemented Angptl4−/− and wild-type mice. In conclusion, 1) ANGPTL4 is not involved in the triglyceride-lowering effect of BA; 2) ANGPTL4 promotes BA absorption during TCA supplementation via a mechanism dependent on the gut microbiota.

Abstract: Human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO-WT) initiates the leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis. LTs play an important role in diseases like asthma, atherosclerosis and in many types of cancer. In this study, we investigated the 5-LO isoforms 5-LO∆13, 5-LO∆4 and 5-LOp12, lacking the exons 13, 4 or a part of exon 12, respectively. We were able to detect the mRNA of the isoforms 5-LO∆13 and 5-LOp12 in B and T cell lines as well as in primary B and T cells and monocytes. Furthermore, we found that expression of 5-LO and particularly of the 5-LO∆13 and 5-LOp12 isoforms is increased in monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis. Confocal microscopy of HEK293T cells stably transfected with tagged 5-LO-WT and/or the isoforms revealed that 5-LO-WT is localized in the nucleus whereas all isoforms are located in the cytosol. Additionally, all isoforms are catalytically inactive and do not seem to influence the specific activity of 5-LO-WT. S271A mutation in 5-LO-WT and treatment of the cells with sorbitol or KN-93/SB203580 changes the localization of the WT enzyme to the cytosol. Despite colocalization with the S271A mutant, the isoforms did not affect LT biosynthesis. Analysis of the phosphorylation pattern of 5-LO-WT and all the isoforms revealed that 5-LOp12 and 5-LO∆13 are highly phosphorylated at Ser271 and 5-LOp12 at Ser523. Furthermore, coexpression of the isoforms inhibited or stimulated 5-LO-WT expression in transiently and stably transfected HEK293T cells suggesting that the isoforms have other functions than canonical LT biosynthesis.

Downregulation of miR-192 causes hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation by inducing SREBF1: Novel mechanism for bisphenol A-triggered non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,

Abstract: Exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Given that microRNA (miRNA) is recognized as a key regulator of lipid metabolism and a potential mediator of environmental cues, this study was designed to explore whether exposure to BPA-triggered abnormal steatosis and lipid accumulation in the liver could be modulated by miR-192. We showed that male post-weaning C57BL/6 mice exposed to 50μg/kg/day of BPA by oral gavage for 90days displayed a NAFLD-like phenotype. In addition, we found in mouse liver and human HepG2 cells that BPA-induced hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation were associated with decreased expression of miR-192, upregulation of SREBF1 and a series of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis. Downregulation of miR-192 in BPA-exposed hepatocytes could be due to defective pre-miR-192 processing by DROSHA. Using HepG2 cells, we further confirmed that miR-192 directly acted on the 3′UTR of SREBF1, contributing to dysregulation of lipid homeostasis in hepatocytes. MiR-192 mimic and lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-192 improved BPA-induced hepatic steatosis by suppressing SREBF1. Lastly, we noted that lipid accumulation was not a strict requirement for developing insulin resistance in mice after BPA treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a novel mechanism in which NAFLD associated with BPA exposure arose from alterations in the miR-192-SREBF1 axis.

Abstract: Impaired cholesterol/lipoprotein metabolism is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by the highly efficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) and flux of the oxysterols 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, potent liver-X-receptor (LXR) activators. HDL and their apolipoproteins are crucial for cerebral lipid transfer, and loss of ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)G1 and G4 results in toxic accumulation of oxysterols in the brain. The HDL-associated apolipoprotein (apo)M is positively correlated with pre-β HDL formation in plasma; its presence and function in the brain was thus far unknown. Using an in vitro model of the BBB, we examined expression, regulation, and functions of ABCG1, ABCG4, and apoM in primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC). RT Q-PCR analyses and immunoblotting revealed that in addition to ABCA1 and scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI), pBCEC express high levels of ABCG1, which was up-regulated by LXR activation. Immunofluorescent staining, site-specific biotinylation and immunoprecipitation revealed that ABCG1 is localized both to early and late endosomes and on apical and basolateral plasma membranes. Using siRNA interference to silence ABCG1 (by 50%) reduced HDL-mediated [3H]-cholesterol efflux (by 50%) but did not reduce [3H]-24(S)-hydroxycholesterol efflux. In addition to apoA-I, pBCEC express and secrete apoM mainly to the basolateral (brain) compartment. HDL enhanced expression and secretion of apoM by pBCEC, apoM-enriched HDL promoted cellular cholesterol efflux more efficiently than apoM-free HDL, while apoM-silencing diminished cellular cholesterol release. We suggest that ABCG1 and apoM are centrally involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism/turnover at the BBB.

Abstract: Resolution of inflammation is important for physiological homeostasis. Chronic inflammatory diseases may be caused by abnormal resolution of inflammation. However, what causes a failure of inflammatory resolution is unclear. Here we investigated the involvement of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein in the control of inflammatory resolution as an ‘anti-resolution factor’. We first confirmed the increased expression of HMGB1 and prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) in inflammatory conditions and HMGB1-mediated regulation of the expression of PTGR1. The inhibition of phagocytosis by HMGB1 was abrogated by PTGR1 silencing. PTGR1 was a direct target of miR522-3p and its expression was regulated by miRNA-522-3p inhibitor or mimic. Finally, miR-522-3p had an important role in the regulation of PTGR1 expression by HMGB1. The data indicates that HMGB1-miR-522-3p-PTGR1 axis may be involved in the abnormal resolution of inflammation and suggests that this mechanism might be a target for modulation of chronic inflammatory disorder.

Abstract: During cold-exposure ‘beige’ adipocytes with increased mitochondrial content are activated in white adipose tissue (WAT). These cells, similarly to brown adipose tissue (BAT), dissipate stored chemical energy in the form of heat with the help of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). We investigated the effect of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) ablation on the function of ATs in mice. Although TG2+/+ and TG2−/− mice had the same amount of WAT and BAT, we found that TG2+/+ animals could tolerate acute cold exposure for 4h, whereas TG2−/− mice only for 3h. Both TG2−/− and TG2+/+ animals used up half of the triacylglycerol content of subcutaneous WAT (SCAT) after 3h treatment; however, TG2−/− mice still possessed markedly whiter and higher amount of gonadal WAT (GONAT) as reflected in the larger size of adipocytes and lower free fatty acid levels in serum. Furthermore, lower expression of ‘beige’ marker genes such as UCP1, TBX1 and TNFRFS9 was observed after cold exposure in GONAT of TG2−/− mice, paralleled with a lower level of UCP1 protein and a decreased mitochondrial content. The detected changes in gene expression of Resistin and Adiponectin did not provoke glucose intolerance in the investigated TG2−/− mice, and TG2 deletion did not influence adrenaline, noradrenaline, glucagon and insulin production. Our data suggest that TG2 has a tissue-specific role in GONAT function and browning, which becomes apparent under acute cold exposure.

Abstract: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae degradation of steryl esters is catalyzed by the steryl ester hydrolases Tgl1p, Yeh1p and Yeh2p. The two steryl ester hydrolases Tgl1p and Yeh1p localize to lipid droplets, a cell compartment storing steryl esters and triacylglycerols. In the present study we investigated regulatory aspects of these two hydrolytic enzymes, namely the gene expression level, protein amount, stability and enzyme activity of Tgl1p and Yeh1p in strains lacking both or only one of the two major nonpolar lipids, steryl esters and triacylglycerols. In a strain lacking both nonpolar lipids and consequently lipid droplets, Tgl1p as well as Yeh1p were present at low amount, became highly unstable compared to wild-type cells, and lost their enzymatic activity. Under these conditions both steryl ester hydrolases were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The lack of steryl esters alone was not sufficient to cause an altered intracellular localization of Tgl1p and Yeh1p. Surprisingly, the stability of Tgl1p and Yeh1p was markedly reduced in a strain lacking triacylglycerols, but their capacity to mobilize steryl esters remained unaffected. We also tested a possible cross-regulation of Tgl1p and Yeh1p by analyzing the behavior of each hydrolase in the absence of its counterpart steryl ester hydrolases. In summary, this study demonstrates a strong regulation of the two lipid droplet associated steryl ester hydrolases Tgl1p and Yeh1p due to the presence/absence of their host organelle.

Abstract: Arabidopsis thaliana has been widely used as a model plant to study acyl lipid metabolism. Seeds of A. thaliana are quite small (approximately 500×300μm and weigh ~20μg), making lipid compositional analyses of single seeds difficult to achieve. Here we have used matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to map and visualize the three-dimensional spatial distributions of two common membrane phospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), in single A. thaliana seeds. The 3D images revealed distinct differences in distribution of several molecular species of both phospholipids among different seed tissues. Using data from these 3D reconstructions, the PC and PI mol% lipid profiles were calculated for the embryonic axis, cotyledons, and peripheral endosperm, and these data agreed well with overall quantification of these lipids in bulk seed extracts analyzed by conventional electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). In addition, MALDI-MSI was used to profile PC and PI molecular species in seeds of wild type, fad2–1, fad3–2, fad6–1, and fae1–1 acyl lipid mutants. The resulting distributions revealed previously unobserved changes in spatial distribution of several lipid molecular species, and were used to suggest new insights into biochemical heterogeneity of seed lipid metabolism. These studies highlight the value of mass spectrometry imaging to provide unprecedented spatial and chemical resolution of metabolites directly in samples even as small as a single A. thaliana seeds, and allow for expanded imaging of plant metabolites to improve our understanding of plant lipid metabolism from a spatial perspective.

Abstract: A polymorphism of TM6SF2 associates with hepatic lipid accumulation and reduction of triacylglycerol (TAG) secretion, but the function of the encoded protein has remained enigmatic. We studied the effect of stable TM6SF2 knock-down on the lipid content and composition, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and organelle structure of HuH7 hepatoma cells. Knock-down of TM6SF2 resulted in intracellular accumulation of TAGs, cholesterol esters, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine. In all of these lipid classes, polyunsaturated lipid species were significantly reduced while saturated and monounsaturated species increased their proportions. The PCs encountered relative and absolute arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) depletion, and AA was also reduced in the total cellular fatty acid pool. Synthesis and turnover of the hepatocellular glycerolipids was enhanced. The TM6SF2 knock-down cells secreted lipoprotein-like particles with a smaller diameter than in the controls, and more lysosome/endosome structures appeared in the knock-down cells. The mitochondrial capacity for palmitate oxidation was significantly reduced. These observations provide novel clues to TM6SF2 function and raise altered mebrane lipid composition and dynamics among the mechanism(s) by which the protein deficiency disturbs hepatic TAG secretion.

Abstract: Membrane lipid raft model has long been debated, but recently the concept of lipid submicrometric domains has emerged to characterize larger (micrometric) and more stable lipid membrane domains. Such domains organize signaling platforms involved in normal or pathological conditions. In this study, adhering human keratinocytes were investigated for their ability to organize such specialized lipid domains. Successful fluorescent probing of lipid domains, by either inserting exogenous sphingomyelin (BODIPY-SM) or using detoxified fragments of lysenin and theta toxins fused to mCherry, allowed specific, sensitive and quantitative detection of sphingomyelin and cholesterol and demonstrated for the first time submicrometric organization of lipid domains in living keratinocytes. Potential functionality of such domains was additionally assessed during replicative senescence, notably through gradual disappearance of SM-rich domains in senescent keratinocytes. Indeed, SM-rich domains were found critical to preserve keratinocyte migration before senescence, because sphingomyelin or cholesterol depletion in keratinocytes significantly alters lipid domains and reduce migration ability.

Abstract: Macrophage polarization determines the timing for the switch from the inflammation phase to the inflammation resolution phase after acute myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid could mitigate the inflammatory lipid mediators in the regulation of macrophage phenotypes and functions with a special regard to myocardial infarction. We initially discovered that ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid selectively suppressed the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) over cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. ω-Alkynyl arachidonic acid also reduced the expression of macrophage M1 biomarkers (e.g., TNF-α, CXCL10, iNOS and IL-6) but increased the expression of macrophage M2 biomarkers (e.g., IL-10 and arginase-1) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid markedly enhanced the phagocytotic activity of macrophages against fluorescently-labeled beads or apoptotic H9c2 cardiac cells. We further investigated the in vivo cardioprotective activities of ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. ω-Alkynyl arachidonic acid indeed reduced infarct size, cardiac damage and the leakage of myocardial enzymes CK-MB. Mechanistic studies revealed that ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid suppressed the overexpression and nuclear translocation of glycolytic enzyme PKM2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay suggested that ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid disrupted the interaction between PKM2 and HIF-1α. Consequently, ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid diminished HIF-1α binding to the HRE sequence in iNOS promoter in response to LPS stimulation. Collectively, ω-alkynyl arachidonic acid may promote the anti-inflammatory M2 polarization of macrophages in acute myocardial infarction via regulating the cross-talk between PKM2, HIF-1α and iNOS.

Abstract: Suppression of fatty acid absorption is one goal to fight obesity. However, the responsible molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Aim of the present study was the search for the key regulator of the overall fatty acid absorption mechanism and its pharmaceutical modulation. As experimental tool we employed the polarized human intestinal tumor derived cell line CaCo2. Here we showed that influx of fatty acids is mediated by an apical heterotetrameric plasma membrane protein complex of which the calcium-independent membrane phospholipase A2 (iPLA2ß) is one constituent. The newly synthesized bile acid-phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholate-lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) blocked iPLA2ß, which structurally disrupted the fatty acid-uptake complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of iPLA2ß lead to reduction of cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) production which suppressed p-JNK1, as a central regulator of metabolism. In a concerted action low p-JNK1 levels prohibited synthesis of the members of the fatty acid uptake complex as well as of apolipoprotein B and the connected members of the basolateral vesicular chylomicron excretion machinery, thereby inhibiting cellular lipid excretion. The basolateral chylomicron release was shown to determine the overall fatty acid-absorption capacity as rate limiting step, whereas apical uptake replenishes the cellular stores, enabling continuous transcellular movement of fatty acids. In conclusion, the UDCA-LPE mediated inhibition of p-JNK1 represents a powerful tool to control intestinal absorption of fatty acids and, thus may be employed as a drug to treat obesity.

Cholesteryl hemiesters alter lysosome structure and function and induce proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages,

Abstract: Rationale
Cholesteryl hemiesters are oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters of cholesterol. Their oxo-ester precursors have been identified as important components of the “core aldehydes” of human atheromata and in oxidized lipoproteins (Ox-LDL). We had previously shown, for the first time, that a single compound of this family, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (ChS), is sufficient to cause irreversible lysosomal lipid accumulation (lipidosis), and is toxic to macrophages. These features, coupled to others such as inflammation, are typically seen in atherosclerosis.
Objective
To obtain insights into the mechanism of cholesteryl hemiester-induced pathological changes in lysosome function and induction of inflammation in vitro and assess their impact in vivo.
Methods and results
We have examined the effects of ChS on macrophages (murine cell lines and primary cultures) in detail. Specifically, lysosomal morphology, pH, and proteolytic capacity were examined. Exposure of macrophages to sub-toxic ChS concentrations caused enlargement of the lysosomes, changes in their luminal pH, and accumulation of cargo in them. In primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), ChS-exposure increased the secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. In zebrafish larvae (wild-type AB and PU.1:EGFP), fed with a ChS-enriched diet, we observed lipid accumulation, myeloid cell-infiltration in their vasculature and decrease in larval survival. Under the same conditions the effects of ChS were more profound than the effects of free cholesterol (FC).
Conclusions
Our data strongly suggest that cholesteryl hemiesters are pro-atherogenic lipids able to mimic features of Ox-LDL both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a highly common chronic neurological disorder, manifested in many different types, affecting ~1% of the worldwide human population. The molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis have not yet been clarified, and pharmacoresistance exhibited by 30–40% of epilepsy patients remains a major obstacle in medical care. Growing evidence indicates a role of lipid signalling pathways in epileptogenesis, thus lipid signals emerge as potential biomarkers for the onset and evolving course of the epileptic disorder, as well as potential therapeutic agents and targets. For this purpose, we applied a lipidomic strategy to unravel lipid alterations in brain regions, periphery tissues and plasma that are specific for acute epileptic seizures in mice at 1h after seizure induction by systemic kainic acid injection as compared to vehicle controls. Specifically, levels of (i) selected phospholipids and sphingomyelins, (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and the endocannabinoid-related compounds oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), (iii) arachidonic acid (AA), (iv) selected eicosanoids, and (v) fatty acyl content of lipidome were determined in pulverized tissues from six brain regions of kainic acid induced epileptic seizure models and vehicle controls: hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and from peripheral organs, such as heart and lungs, and in plasma. Alterations in lipid levels after acute epileptic seizures as compared to non-seizure controls were found to be brain region- and periphery tissue-specific, including specific plasma lipid correlates, highlighting their value as marker candidates in translational research studies, and/or drug discovery and response monitoring.

APP, APLP2 and LRP1 interact with PCSK9 but are not required for PCSK9-mediated degradation of the LDLR in vivo,

Abstract: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that post-transcriptionally regulates the levels of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). PCSK9 binds to the extracellular domain of the LDLR, and the PCSK9-LDLR complex is internalized through canonical clathrin-dependent endocytosis and then delivered to lysosomes for degradation. The mechanism by which PCSK9 blocks recycling of the LDLR has not been fully defined. Previous reports showed that amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) interacts with PCSK9, but its role in PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation remains controversial. Here we found that amyloid precursor protein (APP), APLP2 and LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) interact with PCSK9. To test whether any of these proteins are required for PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation, we examined the effects of disrupting these proteins in mice. Infusion of PCSK9 into App−/−, Aplp2−/−, Aplp2-depleted App−/−, or liver-specific Lrp1−/− mice resulted in similar reductions in the levels of hepatic LDLR as seen in wild-type (WT) mice. Infusion of PCSK9 into WT mice also had no effect on the levels of hepatic APP, APLP2 or LRP1. Thus, APP, APLP2 and LRP1 are not required for PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and are not regulated by PCSK9 in vivo.

Abstract: Aims
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) contains multiple components that endow it with biological activities. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and surface phospholipids contribute to these activities; however, structure-function relationships in HDL particles remain incompletely characterised.
Methods
Reconstituted HDLs (rHDLs) were prepared from apoA-I and soy phosphatidylcholine (PC) at molar ratios of 1:50, 1:100 and 1:150. Oxidative status of apoA-I was varied using controlled oxidation of Met112 residue. HDL-mediated inactivation of PC hydroperoxides (PCOOH) derived from mildly pre-oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was evaluated by HPLC with chemiluminescent detection in HDL+LDL mixtures and re-isolated LDL. Cellular cholesterol efflux was characterised in RAW264.7 macrophages.
Results
rHDL inactivated LDL-derived PCOOH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The capacity of rHDL to both inactivate PCOOH and efflux cholesterol via ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) increased with increasing apoA-I/PC ratio proportionally to the apoA-I content in rHDL. Controlled oxidation of apoA-I Met112 gradually decreased PCOOH-inactivating capacity of rHDL but increased ABCA1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux.
Conclusions
Increasing apoA-I content in rHDL enhanced its antioxidative activity towards oxidized LDL and cholesterol efflux capacity via ABCA1, whereas oxidation of apoA-I Met112 decreased the antioxidative activity but increased the cholesterol efflux. These findings provide important considerations in the design of future HDL therapeutics.

Abstract: Drug addiction is a complex disorder, evoking significant changes in the proteome of the central nervous system. To check if there are also changes in the lipidomic profiles we used desorption electrospray-MS technique for imaging of the brain slices of rats exposed to morphine, cocaine and amphetamine. Our investigations showed alternative regulation of selected lipid's levels in the central nervous system structures, under the influence of applied drugs. Results of our investigations can show changes in the brain treated with drugs of abuse in the new light, indicating role of the lipids in the addiction development.

Abstract: The CYP74 clan enzymes are responsible for the biosynthesis of numerous bioactive oxylipins in higher plants, some Proteobacteria, brown and green algae, and Metazoa. A novel putative CYP74 clan gene CYP443D1 of the starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis, Cnidaria) has been cloned, and the properties of the corresponding recombinant protein have been studied in the present work. The recombinant CYP443D1 was incubated with the 9- and 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic and α-linolenic acids (9-HPOD, 13-HPOD, 9-HPOT, and 13-HPOT, respectively), as well as with the 9-hydroperoxide of γ-linolenic acid (γ-9-HPOT) and 15-hydroperoxide of eicosapentaenoic acid (15-HPEPE). The enzyme was active towards all C18-hydroperoxides with some preference to 9-HPOD. In contrast, 15-HPEPE was a poor substrate. The CYP443D1 specifically converted 9-HPOD into the oxiranyl carbinol 1, (9S,10R,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. Both 18O atoms from [18O2-hydroperoxy]9-HPOD were virtually quantitatively incorporated into product 1. Thus, the CYP443D1 exhibited epoxyalcohol synthase (EAS) activity. The 18O labelling data demonstrated that the reaction mechanism included three sequential steps: (1) hydroperoxyl homolysis, (2) oxy radical rearrangement into epoxyallylic radical, (3) hydroxyl rebound, resulting in oxiranyl carbinol formation. The 9-HPOT and γ-9-HPOT were also specifically converted into the oxiranyl carbinols, 15,16- and 6,7-dehydro analogues of compound 1, respectively. The 13-HPOD was converted into erythro- and threo-isomers of oxiranyl carbinol, as well as oxiranyl vinyl carbinols. The obtained results allow assignment of the name “N. vectensis EAS” (NvEAS) to CYP443D1. The NvEAS is a first EAS detected in Cnidaria.

Abstract: ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a membrane transporter that facilitates nascent HDL formation. Tangier disease subjects with complete ABCA1 deficiency have <5% of normal levels of plasma HDL, elevated triglycerides (TGs), and defective vesicular trafficking in fibroblasts and macrophages. Hepatocyte-specific ABCA1 knockout mice (HSKO) have a similar lipid phenotype with 20% of normal plasma HDL levels and a two-fold elevation of plasma TGs due to hepatic overproduction of large, triglyceride-enriched VLDL. We hypothesized that enhanced VLDL TG secretion in the absence of hepatocyte ABCA1 is due to altered intracellular trafficking of apolipoprotein B (apoB), resulting in augmented TG addition to nascent VLDL. We found that trafficking of newly synthesized apoB through the secretory pathway was delayed in ABCA1-silenced rat hepatoma cells and HSKO primary hepatocytes, relative to controls. Endoglycosidase H treatment of cellular apoB revealed a likely delay in apoB trafficking in post-ER compartments. The reduced rate of protein trafficking was also observed for an adenoviral-expressed GPI-linked fluorescent fusion protein, but not albumin, suggesting a selective delay of secretory cargoes in the absence of hepatocyte ABCA1. Our results suggest an important role for hepatic ABCA1 in regulating secretory trafficking and modulating VLDL expansion during the TG accretion phase of hepatic lipoprotein particle assembly.

Abstract: Lipids played a determinant role in the evolution of the brain. It is postulated that the morphological and functional diversity among neural cells of the human central nervous system (CNS) is projected and achieved through the expression of particular lipid profiles. The present study was designed to evaluate the differential vulnerability to oxidative stress mediated by lipids through a cross-regional comparative approach. To this end, we compared 12 different regions of CNS of healthy adult subjects, and the fatty acid profile and vulnerability to lipid peroxidation, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), respectively. In addition, different components involved in PUFA biosynthesis, as well as adaptive defense mechanisms against lipid peroxidation, were also measured by western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We found that: i) four fatty acids (18.1n-9, 22:6n-3, 20:1n-9, and 18:0) are significant discriminators among CNS regions; ii) these differential fatty acid profiles generate a differential selective neural vulnerability (expressed by the peroxidizability index); iii) the cross-regional differences for the fatty acid profiles follow a caudal-cranial gradient which is directly related to changes in the biosynthesis pathways which can be ascribed to neuronal cells; and iv) the higher the peroxidizability index for a given human brain region, the lower concentration of the protein damage markers, likely supported by the presence of adaptive antioxidant mechanisms. In conclusion, our results suggest that there is a region-specific vulnerability to lipid peroxidation and offer evidence of neuronal mechanisms for polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in the human central nervous system.

Abstract: Ageing is a major risk factor for various forms of liver and gastrointestinal (GI) disease and genetic background may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Group VIA phospholipase A2 or iPLA2β is a homeostatic PLA2 by playing a role in phospholipid metabolism and remodeling. Global iPLA2β−/− mice exhibit aged-dependent phenotypes with body weight loss and abnormalities in the bone and brain. We have previously reported the abnormalities in these mutant mice showing susceptibility for chemical-induced liver injury and colitis. We hypothesize that iPLA2β deficiency may sensitize with ageing for an induction of GI injury. Male wild-type and iPLA2β−/− mice at 4 and 20–22months of age were studied. Aged, but not young, iPLA2β−/−mice showed increased hepatic fibrosis and biliary ductular expansion as well as severe intestinal atrophy associated with increased apoptosis, pro-inflammation, disrupted tight junction, and reduced number of mucin-containing globlet cells. This damage was associated with decreased expression of intestinal endoplasmic stress XBP1 and its regulator HNF1α, FATP4, ACSL5, bile-acid transport genes as well as nuclear receptors LXRα and FXR. By LC/MS-MS profiling, iPLA2β deficiency in aged mice caused an increase of intestinal arachidonate-containing phospholipids concomitant with a decrease in ceramides. By the suppression of intestinal FXR/FGF-15 signaling, hepatic bile-acid synthesis gene expression was increased leading to an elevation of secondary and hydrophobic bile acids in liver, bile, and intestine. In conclusions, ageing sensitized by iPLA2β deficiency caused a decline of key intestinal homeostatic genes resulting in the development of GI disease in a gut-to-liver manner.

Abstract: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) possesses multiple biological activities; small, dense HDL3c particles displaying distinct lipidomic composition exert potent antiatherogenic activities which can be compromised in dyslipidemic, hyperglycemic insulin-resistant states. However, it remains indeterminate (i) whether such functional HDL deficiency is related to altered HDL composition, and (ii) whether it originates from atherogenic dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, or both. In the present work we analyzed compositional characteristics of HDL subpopulations and functional activity of small, dense HDL3c particles in treatment-naïve patients with well-controlled (n=10) and poorly-controlled (n=8) type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in normolipidemic age- and sex-matched controls (n=11). Our data reveal that patients with both well- and poorly-controlled T2D displayed dyslipidemia and low-grade inflammation associated with altered HDL composition. Such compositional alterations in small, dense HDL subfractions were specifically correlated with plasma HbA1c levels. Further analysis using a lipidomic approach revealed that small, dense HDL3c particles from T2D patients with poor glycemic control displayed additional modifications of their chemical composition. In parallel, antioxidative activity of HDL3c towards oxidation of low-density lipoprotein was diminished. These findings indicate that defective functionality of small, dense HDL particles in patients with T2D is not only affected by the presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia, but also by the level of glycemic control, reflecting compositional alterations of HDL.

Abstract: Our understanding of the synthesis and remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipids remains incomplete. Two isoforms of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT1 and 2) and two isoforms of acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT4 and 5) are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting that both lysophosphatidic acid and phosphatidic acid are synthesized in situ for de novo glycerolipid biosynthesis. However, it is believed that the phosphatidic acid substrate for cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is produced at the endoplasmic reticulum whereas the phosphatidic acid synthesized in the mitochondria must be transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum before it undergoes additional steps to form the mature phospholipids that are trafficked back to the mitochondria. It is unclear whether mitochondrial phospholipids are remodeled by mitochondrial acyltransferases or whether lysophospholipids must return to the endoplasmic reticulum or to the mitochondrial associated membrane for reesterification. In this review we will focus on the few glycerolipid acyltransferases that are known to be mitochondrial.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport and exhibits anti-atherosclerosis effects. Some microRNAs (miRs) regulate ABCA1 expression, and recent studies have shown that miR-20a/b might play a critical role in atherosclerotic diseases. Here, we attempted to clarify the potential contribution of miR-20a/b in post-transcriptional regulation of ABCA1, cholesterol efflux, and atherosclerosis. We performed bioinformatics analysis and found that miR-20a/b was highly conserved and directly bound to ABCA1 mRNA with low binding free energy. Luciferase-reporter assay also confirmed that miR-20a/b significantly reduced luciferase activity associated with the ABCA1 3′ untranslated region reporter construct. Additionally, miR-20a/b decreased ABCA1 expression, which, in turn, decreased cholesterol efflux and increased cholesterol content in THP-1 and RAW 264.7 macrophage-derived foam cells. In contrast, miR-20a/b inhibitors increased ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux, decreased cholesterol content, and inhibited foam-cell formation. Consistent with our in vitro results, miR-20a/b-treated ApoE−/− mice showed decreased ABCA1expression in the liver and reductions of reverse cholesterol transport in vivo. Furthermore, miR-20a/b regulated the formation of nascent high-density lipoprotein and promoted atherosclerotic development, whereas miR-20a/b knockdown attenuated atherosclerotic formation. miR-20 is a new miRNA capable of targeting ABCA1 and regulating ABCA1 expression. Therefore, miR-20 inhibition constitutes a new strategy for ABCA1-based treatment of atherosclerosis.
