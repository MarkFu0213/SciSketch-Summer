Abstract: Summary
Secretory pathways within dendrites of neurons have been proposed for local transport of newly synthesized proteins. However, little is known about the dynamics of the local secretory system and whether the organelles are transient or stable structures. Here, we quantify the spatial and dynamic behavior of dendritic Golgi and endosomes during differentiation of human neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In early neuronal development, before and during migration, the entire Golgi apparatus transiently translocates from the soma into dendrites. In mature neurons, dynamic Golgi elements, containing cis and trans cisternae, are transported from the soma along dendrites, in an actin-dependent process. Dendritic Golgi outposts are dynamic and display bidirectional movement. Similar structures were observed in cerebral organoids. Using the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system, Golgi resident proteins are transported efficiently into Golgi outposts from the endoplasmic reticulum. This study reveals dynamic, functional Golgi structures in dendrites and a spatial map for investigating dendrite trafficking in human neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of life-threatening diarrhea in young children in resource-poor settings. To explore microbial influences on susceptibility, we screened 85 microbiota-associated metabolites for their effects on Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro. We identify eight inhibitory metabolites in three main classes: secondary bile salts/acids, a vitamin B6 precursor, and indoles. Growth restriction of C. parvum by indoles does not depend on the host aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Instead, treatment impairs host mitochondrial function and reduces total cellular ATP, as well as directly reducing the membrane potential in the parasite mitosome, a degenerate mitochondria. Oral administration of indoles, or reconstitution of the gut microbiota with indole-producing bacteria, delays life cycle progression of the parasite in vitro and reduces the severity of C. parvum infection in mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that microbiota metabolites impair mitochondrial function and contribute to colonization resistance to Cryptosporidium infection.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses acquire host genes via horizontal transfer and can express them to manipulate host biology during infections. Some homologs retain sequence identity, but evolutionary divergence can obscure host origins. We use structural modeling to compare vaccinia virus proteins with metazoan proteomes. We identify vaccinia A47L as a homolog of gasdermins, the executioners of pyroptosis. An X-ray crystal structure of A47 confirms this homology, and cell-based assays reveal that A47 interferes with caspase function. We also identify vaccinia C1L as the product of a cryptic gene fusion event coupling a Bcl-2-related fold with a pyrin domain. C1 associates with components of the inflammasome, a cytosolic innate immune sensor involved in pyroptosis, yet paradoxically enhances inflammasome activity, suggesting differential modulation during infections. Our findings demonstrate the increasing power of structural homology screens to reveal proteins with unique combinations of domains that viruses capture from host genes and combine in unique ways.

Abstract: Summary
Brain-derived transcriptomes are known to correlate with resting-state brain activity in humans. Whether this association holds in nonhuman primates remains uncertain. Here, we search for such molecular correlates by integrating 757 transcriptomes derived from 100 macaque cortical regions with resting-state activity in separate conspecifics. We observe that 150 noncoding genes explain variations in resting-state activity at a comparable level with protein-coding genes. In-depth analysis of these noncoding genes reveals that they are connected to the function of nonneuronal cells such as oligodendrocytes. Co-expression network analysis finds that the modules of noncoding genes are linked to both autism and schizophrenia risk genes. Moreover, genes associated with resting-state noncoding genes are highly enriched in human resting-state functional genes and memory-effect genes, and their links with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals are altered in the brains of patients with autism. Our results highlight the potential for noncoding RNAs to explain resting-state activity in the nonhuman primate brain.

Abstract: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are ER Ca2+-release channels that control a broad set of cellular processes. Animal models lacking IP3Rs in different combinations display severe developmental phenotypes. Given the importance of IP3Rs in human diseases, we investigated their role in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) by developing single IP3R and triple IP3R knockouts (TKO). Genome edited TKO-hiPSC lacking all three IP3R isoforms, IP3R1, IP3R2, IP3R3, failed to generate Ca2+ signals in response to agonists activating GPCRs, but retained stemness and pluripotency. Steady state metabolite profiling and flux analysis of TKO-hiPSC indicated distinct alterations in tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites consistent with a deficiency in their pyruvate utilization via pyruvate dehydrogenase, shifting towards pyruvate carboxylase pathway. These results demonstrate that IP3Rs are not essential for hiPSC identity and pluripotency but regulate mitochondrial metabolism. This set of knockout hiPSC is a valuable resource for investigating IP3Rs in human cell types of interest.

Abstract: Summary
Plant response to pathogen infection varies within a leaf, yet this heterogeneity is not well resolved. We expose Arabidopsis to Pseudomonas syringae or mock treatment and profile >11,000 individual cells using single-cell RNA sequencing. Integrative analysis of cell populations from both treatments identifies distinct pathogen-responsive cell clusters exhibiting transcriptional responses ranging from immunity to susceptibility. Pseudotime analyses through pathogen infection reveals a continuum of disease progression from an immune to a susceptible state. Confocal imaging of promoter-reporter lines for transcripts enriched in immune cell clusters shows expression surrounding substomatal cavities colonized or in close proximity to bacterial colonies, suggesting that cells within immune clusters represent sites of early pathogen invasion. Susceptibility clusters exhibit more general localization and are highly induced at later stages of infection. Overall, our work shows cellular heterogeneity within an infected leaf and provides insight into plant differential response to infection at a single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in intestinal epithelial tight junctions (TJs) allow paracellular permeation of noxious luminal antigens and are important pathogenic factors in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We show that alpha-tocopherylquinone (TQ), a quinone-structured oxidation product of vitamin E, consistently enhances the intestinal TJ barrier by increasing barrier-forming claudin-3 (CLDN3) and reducing channel-forming CLDN2 in Caco-2 cell monolayers (in vitro), mouse models (in vivo), and surgically resected human colons (ex vivo). TQ reduces colonic permeability and ameliorates colitis symptoms in multiple colitis models. TQ, bifunctionally, activates both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways. Genetic deletion studies reveal that TQ-induced AhR activation transcriptionally increases CLDN3 via xenobiotic response element (XRE) in the CLDN3 promoter. Conversely, TQ suppresses CLDN2 expression via Nrf2-mediated STAT3 inhibition. TQ offers a naturally occurring, non-toxic intervention for enhancement of the intestinal TJ barrier and adjunct therapeutics to treat intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modifications represent a key step in modulating programmed death-1 (PD-1) functions, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Here, we report crosstalk between deglycosylation and ubiquitination in regulating PD-1 stability. We show that the removal of N-linked glycosylation is a prerequisite for efficient PD-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is identified as an E3 ligase of deglycosylated PD-1. In addition, the presence of MDM2 facilitates glycosylated PD-1 interaction with glycosidase NGLY1 and promotes subsequent NGLY1-catalyzed PD-1 deglycosylation. Functionally, we demonstrate that the absence of T cell-specific MDM2 accelerates tumor growth by primarily upregulating PD-1. By stimulating the p53-MDM2 axis, interferon-α (IFN-α) reduces PD-1 levels in T cells, which, in turn, exhibit a synergistic effect on tumor suppression by sensitizing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Our study reveals that MDM2 directs PD-1 degradation via a deglycosylation-ubiquitination coupled mechanism and sheds light on a promising strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy by targeting the T cell-specific MDM2-PD-1 regulatory axis.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage plasticity causes therapeutic resistance; however, it remains unclear how the fate conversion and phenotype switching of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are implicated in disease relapse. Here, we show that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-induced SPP1+ myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) are critical stromal constituents that drive the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our results reveal that SPP1+ myCAFs arise from the inflammatory CAFs in hormone-sensitive PCa; therefore, they represent two functional states of an otherwise ontogenically identical cell type. Antiandrogen treatment unleashes TGF-β signaling, resulting in SOX4-SWI/SNF-dependent CAF phenotype switching. SPP1+ myCAFs in turn render PCa refractory to ADT via an SPP1-ERK paracrine mechanism. Importantly, these sub-myCAFs are associated with inferior therapeutic outcomes, providing the rationale for inhibiting polarization or paracrine mechanisms to circumvent castration resistance. Collectively, our results highlight that therapy-induced phenotypic switching of CAFs is coupled with disease progression and that targeting this stromal component may restrain CRPC.

Abstract: Summary
The pre-mRNA life cycle requires intron processing; yet, how intron-processing defects influence splicing and gene expression is unclear. Here, we find that TTDN1/MPLKIP, which is encoded by a gene implicated in non-photosensitive trichothiodystrophy (NP-TTD), functionally links intron lariat processing to spliceosomal function. The conserved TTDN1 C-terminal region directly binds lariat debranching enzyme DBR1, whereas its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) binds the intron-binding complex (IBC). TTDN1 loss, or a mutated IDR, causes significant intron lariat accumulation, as well as splicing and gene expression defects, mirroring phenotypes observed in NP-TTD patient cells. A Ttdn1-deficient mouse model recapitulates intron-processing defects and certain neurodevelopmental phenotypes seen in NP-TTD. Fusing DBR1 to the TTDN1 IDR is sufficient to recruit DBR1 to the IBC and circumvents the functional requirement for TTDN1. Collectively, our findings link RNA lariat processing with splicing outcomes by revealing the molecular function of TTDN1.

Abstract: Summary
Modification of nucleic acids by ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by various ADP-ribosyltransferases, including the DarT enzyme. The latter is part of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) system DarTG, which was shown to provide control of DNA replication and bacterial growth as well as protection against bacteriophages. Two subfamilies have been identified, DarTG1 and DarTG2, which are distinguished by their associated antitoxins. While DarTG2 catalyzes reversible ADP-ribosylation of thymidine bases employing a macrodomain as antitoxin, the DNA ADP-ribosylation activity of DarTG1 and the biochemical function of its antitoxin, a NADAR domain, are as yet unknown. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we show that DarT1-NADAR is a TA system for reversible ADP-ribosylation of guanosine bases. DarT1 evolved the ability to link ADP-ribose to the guanine amino group, which is specifically hydrolyzed by NADAR. We show that guanine de-ADP-ribosylation is also conserved among eukaryotic and non-DarT-associated NADAR members, indicating a wide distribution of reversible guanine modifications beyond DarTG systems.

Abstract: Summary
In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), clinical response to androgen receptor (AR) antagonists is limited mainly due to AR-variants expression and restored AR signaling. The metabolite spermine is most abundant in prostate and it decreases as prostate cancer progresses, but its functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show spermine inhibits full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) and androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) signaling and suppresses CRPC cell proliferation by directly binding and inhibiting protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1. Spermine reduces H4R3me2a modification at the AR locus and suppresses AR binding as well as H3K27ac modification levels at AR target genes. Spermine supplementation restrains CRPC growth in vivo. PRMT1 inhibition also suppresses AR-FL and AR-V7 signaling and reduces CRPC growth. Collectively, we demonstrate spermine as an anticancer metabolite by inhibiting PRMT1 to transcriptionally inhibit AR-FL and AR-V7 signaling in CRPC, and we indicate spermine and PRMT1 inhibition as powerful strategies overcoming limitations of current AR-based therapies in CRPC.

Abstract: Summary
The diabetes-cancer association remains underexplained. Here, we describe a glucose-signaling axis that reinforces glucose uptake and glycolysis to consolidate the Warburg effect and overcome tumor suppression. Specifically, glucose-dependent CK2 O-GlcNAcylation impedes its phosphorylation of CSN2, a modification required for the deneddylase CSN to sequester Cullin RING ligase 4 (CRL4). Glucose, therefore, elicits CSN-CRL4 dissociation to assemble the CRL4COP1 E3 ligase, which targets p53 to derepress glycolytic enzymes. A genetic or pharmacologic disruption of the O-GlcNAc-CK2-CSN2-CRL4COP1 axis abrogates glucose-induced p53 degradation and cancer cell proliferation. Diet-induced overnutrition upregulates the CRL4COP1-p53 axis to promote PyMT-induced mammary tumorigenesis in wild type but not in mammary-gland-specific p53 knockout mice. These effects of overnutrition are reversed by P28, an investigational peptide inhibitor of COP1-p53 interaction. Thus, glycometabolism self-amplifies via a glucose-induced post-translational modification cascade culminating in CRL4COP1-mediated p53 degradation. Such mutation-independent p53 checkpoint bypass may represent the carcinogenic origin and targetable vulnerability of hyperglycemia-driven cancer.

Abstract: We examined the effects of weight bearing after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on muscle atrophy in rats. Rats were divided into the following groups: untreated control, ACL reconstruction (amount of weight bearing was small), ACL reconstruction plus hindlimb unloading (nonweight bearing), and ACL reconstruction plus morphine administration (amount of weight bearing was large) groups. At 7 or 14 days after surgery, atrophy of the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius was assessed. ACL reconstruction induced muscle atrophy in the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. Unloading facilitated atrophy in the gastrocnemius but not in the rectus femoris. Morphine administration partially prevented atrophy in the gastrocnemius but not in the rectus femoris. After ACL reconstruction, the gene expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is involved in protein synthesis, was downregulated in the gastrocnemius. Unloading decreased the gene expression of IGF-1 and increased the gene expression of atrogin-1, which is involved in protein breakdown, in the gastrocnemius. Morphine administration attenuated the downregulation of IGF-1. Atrophy of the gastrocnemius was more severe with a decrease in weight bearing, although the effect of weight bearing on rectus femoris atrophy was limited in rats. Early weight bearing is effective for reducing gastrocnemius muscle atrophy after ACL reconstruction.

Abstract: Summary
While it has been established that the responses of T cells to antigens are combinatorially regulated by multiple signaling pathways, it remains elusive what mechanisms cells utilize to quantitatively modulate T cell responses during pathway integration. Here, we show that two key pathways in T cell signaling, calcium/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and protein kinase C (PKC)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), integrate through a dynamic and combinatorial strategy to fine-tune T cell response genes. At the cis-regulatory level, the two pathways integrate through co-binding of NFAT and NF-κB to immune response genes. Pathway integration is further regulated temporally, where T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) activation signals modulate the temporal relationships between the nuclear localization dynamics of NFAT and NF-κB. Such physical and temporal integrations together contribute to distinct modes of expression modulation for genes. Thus, the temporal relationships between regulators can be modulated to affect their co-targets during immune responses, underscoring the importance of dynamic combinatorial regulation in cellular signaling.

Abstract: Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) contributes to several physiological and pathological conditions including transcription, secretion, immunodeficiencies, and cancer. SOCE has been shown to be important for breast cancer cell migration where knockdown of SOCE components (STIM1 or Orai1) decreases cancer metastasis. Here we show unexpectedly that complete knockout of STIM1 (STIM1-KO) using gene editing in metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells results in faster migration and enhanced invasion capacity. In contrast, Orai1-KO cells, which have similar levels of SOCE inhibition as STIM1-KO, migrate slower than the parental cell line. This shows that the enhanced migration phenotype of STIM1-KO cells is not due to the loss of Ca2+ entry through SOCE, rather it involves transcriptional remodeling as elucidated by RNA-seq analyses. Interestingly, NFAT1 is significantly downregulated in STIM1-KO cells and overexpression of NFAT1 reversed the enhanced migration of STIM1-KO cells. STIM1 knockout in other breast cancer cells, independent of their metastatic potential, also enhanced cell migration while reducing NFAT1 expression. These data argue that in breast cancer cells STIM1 modulates NFAT1 expression and cell migration independently of its role in SOCE.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate stability is essential to maintaining “law and order” in complex animals. However, high stability comes at the cost of reduced plasticity and, by extension, poor regenerative ability. This evolutionary trade-off has resulted in most modern animals being rather simple and regenerative or complex and non-regenerative. The mechanisms mediating cellular plasticity and allowing for regeneration remain unknown. We show that signals emitted by senescent cells can destabilize the differentiated state of neighboring somatic cells, reprogramming them into stem cells that are capable of driving whole-body regeneration in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of senescence prevents reprogramming and regeneration. Conversely, induction of transient ectopic senescence in a regenerative context results in supernumerary stem cells and faster regeneration. We propose that senescence signaling is an ancient mechanism mediating cellular plasticity. Understanding the senescence environment that promotes cellular reprogramming could provide an avenue to enhance regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) alters decision-making control over actions, but disruptions to the responsible neural circuit mechanisms are unclear. Premotor corticostriatal circuits are implicated in balancing goal-directed and habitual control over actions and show disruption in disorders with compulsive, inflexible behaviors, including AUD. However, whether there is a causal link between disrupted premotor activity and altered action control is unknown. Here, we find that mice chronically exposed to alcohol (chronic intermittent ethanol [CIE]) showed impaired ability to use recent action information to guide subsequent actions. Prior CIE exposure resulted in aberrant increases in the calcium activity of premotor cortex (M2) neurons that project to the dorsal medial striatum (M2-DMS) during action control. Chemogenetic reduction of this CIE-induced hyperactivity in M2-DMS neurons rescued goal-directed action control. This suggests a direct, causal relationship between chronic alcohol disruption to premotor circuits and decision-making strategy and provides mechanistic support for targeting activity of human premotor regions as a potential treatment in AUD.

Abstract: Summary
Saccadic eye movements are known to cause saccadic suppression, a temporary reduction in visual sensitivity and visual cortical firing rates. While saccadic suppression has been well characterized at the level of perception and single neurons, relatively little is known about the visual cortical networks governing this phenomenon. Here we examine the effects of saccadic suppression on distinct neural subpopulations within visual area V4. We find subpopulation-specific differences in the magnitude and timing of peri-saccadic modulation. Input-layer neurons show changes in firing rate and inter-neuronal correlations prior to saccade onset, and putative inhibitory interneurons in the input layer elevate their firing rate during saccades. A computational model of this circuit recapitulates our empirical observations and demonstrates that an input-layer-targeting pathway can initiate saccadic suppression by enhancing local inhibitory activity. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how eye movement signaling interacts with cortical circuitry to enforce visual stability.

Abstract: Summary
Completion of neuronal migration is critical for brain development. Kif21b is a plus-end-directed kinesin motor protein that promotes intracellular transport and controls microtubule dynamics in neurons. Here we report a physiological function of Kif21b during radial migration of projection neurons in the mouse developing cortex. In vivo analysis in mouse and live imaging on cultured slices demonstrate that Kif21b regulates the radial glia-guided locomotion of newborn neurons independently of its motility on microtubules. We show that Kif21b directly binds and regulates the actin cytoskeleton both in vitro and in vivo in migratory neurons. We establish that Kif21b-mediated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics influences branching and nucleokinesis during neuronal locomotion. Altogether, our results reveal atypical roles of Kif21b on the actin cytoskeleton during migration of cortical projection neurons.

Abstract: Summary
The complex cytoarchitecture of neurons poses significant challenges for the maturation of synaptic membrane proteins. It is currently unclear whether locally secreted synaptic proteins bypass the Golgi or whether they traffic through Golgi satellites (GSs). Here, we create a transgenic GS reporter mouse line and show that GSs are widely distributed along dendrites and are capable of mature glycosylation, in particular sialylation. We find that polysialylation of locally secreted NCAM takes place at GSs. Accordingly, in mice lacking a component of trans-Golgi network-to-plasma membrane trafficking, we find fewer GSs and significantly reduced PSA-NCAM levels in distal dendrites of CA1 neurons that receive input from the temporoammonic pathway. Induction of long-term potentiation at those, but not more proximal, synapses is severely impaired. We conclude that GSs serve the need for local mature glycosylation of synaptic membrane proteins in distal dendrites and thereby contribute to rapid changes in synaptic strength.

Abstract: Summary
Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was found to be specifically depleted in female patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Administration of C. maltaromaticum reduces intestinal tumor formation in two murine CRC models in a female-specific manner. Estrogen increases the attachment and colonization of C. maltaromaticum via increasing the colonic expression of SLC3A2 that binds to DD-CPase of this bacterium. Metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling unveils the increased gut abundance of vitamin D-related metabolites and the mucosal activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling in C. maltaromaticum-gavaged mice in a gut microbiome- and VDR-dependent manner. In vitro fermentation system confirms the metabolic cross-feeding of C. maltaromaticum with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to convert C. maltaromaticum-produced 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D for activating the host VDR signaling. Overall, C. maltaromaticum colonizes the gut in an estrogen-dependent manner and acts along with other microbes to augment the intestinal vitamin D production to activate the host VDR for suppressing CRC.

Abstract: The flexibility between the wide array of hepatic functions relies on calcium (Ca2+) signalling. Indeed, Ca2+ is implicated in the control of many intracellular functions as well as intercellular communication. Thus, hepatocytes adapt their Ca2+ signalling depending on their nutritional and hormonal environment, leading to opposite cellular functions, such as glucose storage or synthesis. Interestingly, hepatic metabolic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, are associated with impaired Ca2+ signalling. Here, we present the hepatocytes’ toolkit for Ca2+ signalling, complete with regulation systems and signalling pathways activated by nutrients and hormones. We further discuss the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms leading to alterations of Ca2+ signalling in hepatic metabolic diseases, and review the literature on the clinical impact of Ca2+-targeting therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
While a few works have shown that Mettl3 plays oncogenic roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its function in early HCC tumorigenesis remains unclear. In Mettl3flox/flox; Alb-Cre knockout mice, Mettl3 loss leads to aberrant hepatocyte homeostasis and liver damage. Importantly, Mettl3 deletion dramatically accelerates liver tumorigenesis in various HCC mouse models. Depletion of Mettl3 in adult Mettl3flox/flox mice through TBG-Cre administration also enhances liver tumor development, while overexpression of Mettl3 inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, aggravated tumorigenesis upon Mettl3 deletion is a consequence of hepatocyte dedifferentiation and hyperproliferation via m6A-mediated modulation on Hnf4α and cell cycle genes. In contrast, by using Mettl3flox/flox; Ubc-Cre mice, depletion of Mettl3 in established HCC ameliorates tumor progression. Additionally, Mettl3 is overexpressed in HCC tumors compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The present findings define a tumor-suppressive role of Mettl3 in liver tumorigenesis, indicating its potentially opposite stage-dependent functions in HCC initiation versus progression.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (G-NEC) are aggressive malignancies with poorly understood biology and a lack of disease models. Here, we use genome sequencing to characterize the genomic landscapes of human G-NEC and its histologic variants. We identify global and subtype-specific alterations and expose hitherto unappreciated gains of MYC family members in a large part of cases. Genetic engineering and lineage tracing in mice delineate a model of G-NEC evolution, which defines MYC as a critical driver and positions the cancer cell of origin to the neuroendocrine compartment. MYC-driven tumors have pronounced metastatic competence and display defined signaling addictions, as revealed by large-scale genetic and pharmacologic screening of cell lines and organoid resources. We create global maps of G-NEC dependencies, highlight critical vulnerabilities, and validate therapeutic targets, including candidates for clinical drug repurposing. Our study gives comprehensive insights into G-NEC biology.

Abstract: Summary
Type IV CRISPR-Cas systems, which are primarily found on plasmids and exhibit a strong plasmid-targeting preference, are the only one of the six known CRISPR-Cas types for which the mechanistic details of their function remain unknown. Here, we provide high-resolution functional snapshots of type IV-A Csf complexes before and after target dsDNA binding, either in the absence or presence of CasDinG, revealing the mechanisms underlying CsfcrRNA complex assembly, “DWN” PAM-dependent dsDNA targeting, R-loop formation, and CasDinG recruitment. Furthermore, we establish that CasDinG, a signature DinG family helicase, harbors ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP-dependent 5′-3′ DNA helicase activity. In addition, we show that CasDinG unwinds the non-target strand (NTS) and target strand (TS) of target dsDNA from the CsfcrRNA complex. These molecular details advance our mechanistic understanding of type IV-A CRISPR-Csf function and should enable Csf complexes to be harnessed as genome-engineering tools for biotechnological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivating STK11/LKB1 mutations are genomic drivers of primary resistance to immunotherapy in KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), although the underlying mechanisms remain unelucidated. We find that LKB1 loss results in enhanced lactate production and secretion via the MCT4 transporter. Single-cell RNA profiling of murine models indicates that LKB1-deficient tumors have increased M2 macrophage polarization and hypofunctional T cells, effects that could be recapitulated by the addition of exogenous lactate and abrogated by MCT4 knockdown or therapeutic blockade of the lactate receptor GPR81 expressed on immune cells. Furthermore, MCT4 knockout reverses the resistance to PD-1 blockade induced by LKB1 loss in syngeneic murine models. Finally, tumors from STK11/LKB1 mutant LUAD patients demonstrate a similar phenotype of enhanced M2-macrophages polarization and hypofunctional T cells. These data provide evidence that lactate suppresses antitumor immunity and therapeutic targeting of this pathway is a promising strategy to reversing immunotherapy resistance in STK11/LKB1 mutant LUAD.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate neuromodulation through the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ). Classical models depict that G protein activation leads to a one-to-one formation of Gα-GTP and Gβγ species. Each of these species propagates signaling by independently acting on effectors, but the mechanisms by which response fidelity is ensured by coordinating Gα and Gβγ responses remain unknown. Here, we reveal a paradigm of G protein regulation whereby the neuronal protein GINIP (Gα inhibitory interacting protein) biases inhibitory GPCR responses to favor Gβγ over Gα signaling. Tight binding of GINIP to Gαi-GTP precludes its association with effectors (adenylyl cyclase) and, simultaneously, with regulator-of-G-protein-signaling (RGS) proteins that accelerate deactivation. As a consequence, Gαi-GTP signaling is dampened, whereas Gβγ signaling is enhanced. We show that this mechanism is essential to prevent the imbalances of neurotransmission that underlie increased seizure susceptibility in mice. Our findings reveal an additional layer of regulation within a quintessential mechanism of signal transduction that sets the tone of neurotransmission.

Abstract: Summary
Cell proliferation is a central process in tissue development, homeostasis, and disease, yet how proliferation is regulated in the tissue context remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to elucidate how tissue growth dynamics regulate cell proliferation. Using MDCK epithelial monolayers, we show that a limiting rate of tissue expansion creates confinement that suppresses cell growth; however, this confinement does not directly affect the cell cycle. This leads to uncoupling between rates of cell growth and division in epithelia and, thereby, reduces cell volume. Division becomes arrested at a minimal cell volume, which is consistent across diverse epithelia in vivo. Here, the nucleus approaches the minimum volume capable of packaging the genome. Loss of cyclin D1-dependent cell-volume regulation results in an abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and DNA damage. Overall, we demonstrate how epithelial proliferation is regulated by the interplay between tissue confinement and cell-volume regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Social sensitivity to other individuals in distress is crucial for survival. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a structure involved in making behavioral choices and is influenced by observed pain or distress. Nevertheless, our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying this sensitivity is incomplete. Here, we reveal unexpected sex-dependent activation of ACC when parental mice respond to distressed pups by returning them to the nest (“pup retrieval”). We observe sex differences in the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons during parental care, and inactivation of ACC excitatory neurons increased pup neglect. Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline in ACC during pup retrieval, and inactivation of the LC-ACC pathway disrupts parental care. We conclude that ACC maintains sex-dependent sensitivity to pup distress under LC modulation. We propose that ACC’s involvement in parenting presents an opportunity to identify neural circuits that support sensitivity to the emotional distress of others.

Abstract: Summary
Bidirectional communication between the developing conceptus and endometrium is essential for pregnancy recognition and establishment in ruminants. We dissect the transcriptomic dynamics of sheep conceptus and corresponding endometrium at pre- and peri-implantation stages using single-cell RNA sequencing. Spherical blastocysts contain five cell types, with 68.62% trophectoderm cells. Strikingly, elongated conceptuses differentiate into 17 cell types, indicating dramatic cell fate specifications. Cell-type-specific gene expression delineates the features of distinctive trophectoderm lineages and indicates that the transition from polar trophectoderm to trophoblast increases interferon-tau expression and likely drives elongation initiation. We identify 13 endometrium-derived cell types and elucidate their molecular responses to conceptus development. Integrated analyses uncover multiple paired transcripts mediating the dialogues between extraembryonic membrane and endometrium, including IGF2-IGF1R, FGF19-FGFR1, NPY-NPY1R, PROS1-AXL, and ADGRE5-CD55. These data provide insight into the molecular regulation of conceptus elongation and represent a valuable resource for functional investigations of pre- and peri-implantation ruminant development.

Abstract: Summary
Amygdala circuitry encodes associations between conditioned stimuli and aversive unconditioned stimuli and also controls fear expression. However, whether and how non-threatening information for unpaired conditioned stimuli (CS−) is discretely processed remains unknown. The fear expression toward CS− is robust immediately after fear conditioning but then becomes negligible after memory consolidation. The synaptic plasticity of the neural pathway from the lateral to the anterior basal amygdala gates the fear expression of CS−, depending upon neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4)-mediated dopamine receptor D4 (Drd4) synthesis, which is precluded by stress exposure or corticosterone injection. Herein, we show cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the non-threatening (safety) memory consolidation, supporting the fear discrimination.

Abstract: Summary
Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a cancer syndrome caused by inactivating germline mutations in fumarate hydratase (FH) and subsequent accumulation of fumarate. Fumarate accumulation leads to profound epigenetic changes and the activation of an anti-oxidant response via nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NRF2. The extent to which chromatin remodeling shapes this anti-oxidant response is currently unknown. Here, we explored the effects of FH loss on the chromatin landscape to identify transcription factor networks involved in the remodeled chromatin landscape of FH-deficient cells. We identify FOXA2 as a key transcription factor that regulates anti-oxidant response genes and subsequent metabolic rewiring cooperating without direct interaction with the anti-oxidant regulator NRF2. The identification of FOXA2 as an anti-oxidant regulator provides additional insights into the molecular mechanisms behind cell responses to fumarate accumulation and potentially provides further avenues for therapeutic intervention for HLRCC.

Abstract: Summary
RNA granules are membraneless condensates that provide functional compartmentalization within cells. The mechanisms by which RNA granules form are under intense investigation. Here, we characterize the role of mRNAs and proteins in the formation of germ granules in Drosophila. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the number, size, and distribution of germ granules is precisely controlled. Surprisingly, germ granule mRNAs are not required for the nucleation or the persistence of germ granules but instead control their size and composition. Using an RNAi screen, we determine that RNA regulators, helicases, and mitochondrial proteins regulate germ granule number and size, while the proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear pore complex, and cytoskeleton control their distribution. Therefore, the protein-driven formation of Drosophila germ granules is mechanistically distinct from the RNA-dependent condensation observed for other RNA granules such as stress granules and P-bodies.

Abstract: Background
Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a prevalent reason for acute kidney injury and a key clinical issue for patients under anesthesia and about to have surgery. We aim to investigate the Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) role in renal IRI and the underlying mechanisms.
Methods
Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database helped in analyzing the SPP1 expression in renal IRI. We established two models, a mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) besides a hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) HK-2 cell. Renal tubular lesions were measured using H&E staining. Depending on the TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, as well as western blot, we applied the assessment of apoptosis and apoptosis-associated protein levels. At the same time, a western blot was performed for assessing PI3K/AKT pathway-associated proteins.
Results
GEO data and experimental validation revealed elevated SPP1 content in the kidney tissues of renal I/R mice more than in sham mice. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed an increase in cell apoptosis due to SPP1 overexpression, but the opposite is true when SPP1 is silenced. SPP1 downregulation led to high p-PI3K and p-AKT protein levels, and the LY294002 application inhibited SPP1 inhibition-mediated anti-apoptotic effect
Conclusion
Taken together, SPP1 exacerbates renal IRI in vivo and in vitro via promoting programmed cell death by inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic crossovers are required for accurate chromosome segregation and producing new allelic combinations. Meiotic crossover numbers are tightly regulated within a narrow range, despite an excess of initiating DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we reveal the tumor suppressor FANCM as a meiotic anti-crossover factor in mammals. We use unique large-scale crossover analyses with both single-gamete sequencing and pedigree-based bulk-sequencing datasets to identify a genome-wide increase in crossover frequencies in Fancm-deficient mice. Gametogenesis is heavily perturbed in Fancm loss-of-function mice, which is consistent with the reproductive defects reported in humans with biallelic FANCM mutations. A portion of the gametogenesis defects can be attributed to the cGAS-STING pathway after birth. Despite the gametogenesis phenotypes in Fancm mutants, both sexes are capable of producing offspring. We propose that the anti-crossover function and role in gametogenesis of Fancm are separable and will inform diagnostic pathways for human genomic instability disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype with limited effective therapies because of the absence of definitive targets. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of ZNF451, a poorly characterized vertebrate zinc-finger protein, is upregulated in TNBC and associated with a poor prognosis. Elevated ZNF451 expression facilitates TNBC progression by interacting with and enhancing the activity of the transcriptional activator snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SLUG). Mechanistically, the ZNF451-SLUG complex preferentially recruits the acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) to the CCL5 promoter, selectively facilitating CCL5 transcription by enhancing the acetylation of SLUG and local chromatin, leading to recruitment and activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Disturbing the ZNF451-SLUG interaction using a peptide suppresses TNBC progression by reducing CCL5 expression and counteracting the migration and activation of TAMs. Collectively, our work provides mechanistic insights into the oncogene-like functions of ZNF451 and suggests that ZNF451 is a potential target for development of effective therapies against TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
Protein lysine crotonylation has been recently identified as a vital posttranslational modification in cellular processes, particularly through the modification of histones. We show that lysine crotonylation is an important modification of the cytoplastic and mitochondria proteins. Enzymes in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid metabolism, glutamine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, the urea cycle, one-carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics are found to be extensively crotonylated in pancreatic cancer cells. This modulation is mainly controlled by a pair of crotonylation writers and erasers including CBP/p300, HDAC1, and HDAC3. The dynamic crotonylation of metabolic enzymes is involved in metabolism regulation, which is linked with tumor progression. Interestingly, the activation of MTHFD1 by decrotonylation at Lys354 and Lys553 promotes the development of pancreatic cancer by increasing resistance to ferroptosis. Our study suggests that crotonylation represents a metabolic regulatory mechanism in pancreatic cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Biological patterning events that occur early in development establish proper tissue morphogenesis. Identifying the mechanisms that guide these patterning events is necessary in order to understand the molecular drivers of development and disease and to build tissues in vitro. In this study, we use an in vitro model of gastrulation to study the role of tight junctions and apical/basolateral polarity in modulating bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4) signaling and gastrulation-associated patterning in colonies of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Disrupting tight junctions via knockdown (KD) of the scaffolding tight junction protein-1 (TJP1, also known as ZO1) allows BMP4 to robustly and ubiquitously activate pSMAD1/5 signaling over time, resulting in loss of the patterning phenotype and marked differentiation bias of pluripotent stem cells to primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs). These findings give important insights into how signaling events are regulated and lead to spatial emergence of diverse cell types in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) targeting the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) on the sporozoite surface are a promising tool for preventing malaria infection. However, their mechanisms of protection remain unclear. Here, using 13 distinctive PfCSP hmAbs, we provide a comprehensive view of how PfCSP hmAbs neutralize sporozoites in host tissues. Sporozoites are most vulnerable to hmAb-mediated neutralization in the skin. However, rare but potent hmAbs additionally neutralize sporozoites in the blood and liver. Efficient protection in tissues mainly associates with high-affinity and high-cytotoxicity hmAbs inducing rapid parasite loss-of-fitness in the absence of complement and host cells in vitro. A 3D-substrate assay greatly enhances hmAb cytotoxicity and mimics the skin-dependent protection, indicating that the physical stress imposed on motile sporozoites by the skin is crucial for unfolding the protective potential of hmAbs. This functional 3D cytotoxicity assay can thus be useful for downselecting potent anti-PfCSP hmAbs and vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Aging impairs the capacity to respond to novel antigens, reducing immune protection against pathogens and vaccine efficacy. Dietary restriction (DR) extends life- and health span in diverse animals. However, little is known about the capacity of DR to combat the decline in immune function. Here, we study the changes in B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire during aging in DR and control mice. By sequencing the variable region of the BCR heavy chain in the spleen, we show that DR preserves diversity and attenuates the increase in clonal expansions throughout aging. Remarkably, mice starting DR in mid-life have repertoire diversity and clonal expansion rates indistinguishable from chronic DR mice. In contrast, in the intestine, these traits are unaffected by either age or DR. Reduced within-individual B cell repertoire diversity and increased clonal expansions are correlated with higher morbidity, suggesting a potential contribution of B cell repertoire dynamics to health during aging.

Abstract: Summary
The present study examines whether there is a mechanism beyond the current concept of post-translational modifications to regulate the function of a protein. A small gas molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), was found to bind at active-site copper of Cu/Zn-SOD using a series of methods including radiolabeled binding assay, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and crystallography. Such an H2S binding enhanced the electrostatic forces to guide the negatively charged substrate superoxide radicals to the catalytic copper ion, changed the geometry and energy of the frontier molecular orbitals of the active site, and subsequently facilitated the transfer of an electron from the superoxide radical to the catalytic copper ion and the breakage of the copper-His61 bridge. The physiological relevance of such an H2S effect was also examined in both in vitro and in vivo models where the cardioprotective effects of H2S were dependent on Cu/Zn-SOD.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) are caused by a deficit of functional insulin-producing β cells. Thus, the identification of β cell trophic agents could allow the development of therapeutic strategies to counteract diabetes. The discovery of SerpinB1, an elastase inhibitor that promotes human β cell growth, prompted us to hypothesize that pancreatic elastase (PE) regulates β cell viability. Here, we report that PE is up-regulated in acinar cells and in islets from T2D patients, and negatively impacts β cell viability. Using high-throughput screening assays, we identified telaprevir as a potent PE inhibitor that can increase human and rodent β cell viability in vitro and in vivo and improve glucose tolerance in insulin-resistant mice. Phospho-antibody microarrays and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified PAR2 and mechano-signaling pathways as potential mediators of PE. Taken together, our work highlights PE as a potential regulator of acinar-β cell crosstalk that acts to limit β cell viability, leading to T2D.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a global health issue with an increasing incidence. Although the pathogenesis of IBDs has been investigated intensively, the etiology of IBDs remains enigmatic. Here, we report that interleukin-3 (Il-3)-deficient mice are more susceptible and exhibit increased intestinal inflammation during the early stage of experimental colitis. IL-3 is locally expressed in the colon by cells harboring a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype and protects by promoting the early recruitment of splenic neutrophils with high microbicidal capability into the colon. Mechanistically, IL-3-dependent neutrophil recruitment involves CCL5+ PD-1high LAG-3high T cells, STAT5, and CCL20 and is sustained by extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis. During acute colitis, Il-3−/− show, however, increased resistance to the disease as well as reduced intestinal inflammation. Altogether, this study deepens our understanding of IBD pathogenesis, identifies IL-3 as an orchestrator of intestinal inflammation, and reveals the spleen as an emergency reservoir for neutrophils during colonic inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies coordinate immune effector responses by interacting with effector cells via fragment crystallizable γ (Fcγ) receptors. The IgG Fc domain directs effector responses through subclass and glycosylation variation. Although each Fc variant has been extensively characterized in isolation, during immune responses, IgG is almost always produced in Fc mixtures. How this influences effector responses has not been examined. Here, we measure Fcγ receptor binding to mixed Fc immune complexes. Binding of these mixtures falls along a continuum between pure cases and quantitatively matches a mechanistic model, except for several low-affinity interactions mostly involving IgG2. We find that the binding model provides refined estimates of their affinities. Finally, we demonstrate that the model predicts effector cell-elicited platelet depletion in humanized mice. Contrary to previous views, IgG2 exhibits appreciable binding through avidity, though it is insufficient to induce effector responses. Overall, this work demonstrates a quantitative framework for modeling mixed IgG Fc-effector cell regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Rad24-RFC (replication factor C) loads the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp onto the recessed 5′ ends by binding a 5′ DNA at an external surface site and threading the 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into 9-1-1. We find here that Rad24-RFC loads 9-1-1 onto DNA gaps in preference to a recessed 5′ end, thus presumably leaving 9-1-1 on duplex 3′ ss/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) after Rad24-RFC ejects from DNA. We captured five Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 loading intermediates using a 10-nt gap DNA. We also determined the structure of Rad24-RFC–9-1-1 using a 5-nt gap DNA. The structures reveal that Rad24-RFC is unable to melt DNA ends and that a Rad24 loop limits the dsDNA length in the chamber. These observations explain Rad24-RFC’s preference for a preexisting gap of over 5-nt ssDNA and suggest a direct role of the 9-1-1 in gap repair with various TLS (trans-lesion synthesis) polymerases in addition to signaling the ATR kinase.

Abstract: Introduction
Stem cell therapy has been gaining interest in the regeneration rather than repair of lost human tissues. However, the manual analysis of stem cells prior to implantation is a cumbersome task that can be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process.
Objective
To develop a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm for segmentation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on micrographic images and to validate its performance relative to the ground truth laid down via annotation.
Methodology
Pre-trained DeepLab algorithms were trained on annotated images of human MSCs obtained from the open-source EVICAN dataset. This dataset comprises of partially annotated images; a limitation that is overcome by blurring backgrounds of these images which consequently blurs the unannotated cells. Two algorithms were trained on the two different kinds of images from this dataset; with blurred and normal backgrounds, respectively. Algorithm 1 was trained on 139 images with blurred backgrounds and algorithm 2 was trained on 37 images from the same dataset with normal backgrounds to replicate real-life scenarios.
Results
The performance metrics of algorithm 1 included accuracy of 99.22%, dice co-efficient of 99.66% and Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.84. Algorithm 2 was 96.34% accurate with dice co-efficient and IoU scores of 98.39% and 0.48, respectively.
Conclusion
Both algorithms showed adequate performance in the segmentation of human MSCs with performance metrics close to the ground truth. However, algorithm 2 has better clinical applicability, even with smaller dataset and relatively lower performance metrics.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate the gene expression programs that define each cell’s identity. The canonical TF accomplishes this with two domains, one that binds specific DNA sequences and the other that binds protein coactivators or corepressors. We find that at least half of TFs also bind RNA, doing so through a previously unrecognized domain with sequence and functional features analogous to the arginine-rich motif of the HIV transcriptional activator Tat. RNA binding contributes to TF function by promoting the dynamic association between DNA, RNA, and TF on chromatin. TF-RNA interactions are a conserved feature important for vertebrate development and disrupted in disease. We propose that the ability to bind DNA, RNA, and protein is a general property of many TFs and is fundamental to their gene regulatory function.

Abstract: Summary
Septins self-assemble into polymers that bind and deform membranes in vitro and regulate diverse cell behaviors in vivo. How their in vitro properties relate to their in vivo functions is under active investigation. Here, we uncover requirements for septins in detachment and motility of border cell clusters in the Drosophila ovary. Septins and myosin colocalize dynamically at the cluster periphery and share phenotypes but, surprisingly, do not impact each other. Instead, Rho independently regulates myosin activity and septin localization. Active Rho recruits septins to membranes, whereas inactive Rho sequesters septins in the cytoplasm. Mathematical analyses identify how manipulating septin expression levels alters cluster surface texture and shape. This study shows that the level of septin expression differentially regulates surface properties at different scales. This work suggests that downstream of Rho, septins tune surface deformability while myosin controls contractility, the combination of which governs cluster shape and movement.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for all domains of life. Cells maintain zinc homeostasis using a network of transporters, buffers, and transcription factors. Zinc is required for mammalian cell proliferation, and zinc homeostasis is remodeled during the cell cycle, but whether labile zinc changes in naturally cycling cells has not been established. We use genetically encoded fluorescent reporters, long-term time-lapse imaging, and computational tools to track labile zinc over the cell cycle in response to changes in growth media zinc and knockdown of the zinc-regulatory transcription factor MTF-1. Cells experience a pulse of labile zinc in early G1, whose magnitude varies with zinc in growth media. Knockdown of MTF-1 increases labile zinc and the zinc pulse. Our results suggest that cells need a minimum zinc pulse to proliferate and that if labile zinc levels are too high, cells pause proliferation until labile cellular zinc is lowered.

Abstract: Summary
Melatonin has been reported to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and exploring the underlying mechanisms will be beneficial for better treatment of NAFLD. Choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD)- and methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD)-fed mice with melatonin intervention exhibit significantly decreased liver steatosis, lobular inflammation, and focal liver necrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that melatonin selectively inhibits pro-inflammatory CCR3+ monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) and upregulates anti-inflammatory CD206+ MoMFs in NAFLD mice. Liver-infiltrating CCR3+CD14+ MoMFs are also significantly increased in patients with NAFLD. Mechanistically, melatonin receptor-independent BTG2-ATF4 signaling plays a role in the regulation of CCR3+ MoMF endoplasmic reticulum stress, survival, and inflammation. In contrast, melatonin upregulates CD206+ MoMF survival and polarization via MT1/2 receptors. Melatonin stimulation also regulates human CCR3+ MoMF and CD206+ MoMF survival and inflammation in vitro. Furthermore, CCR3 depletion antibody monotherapy inhibits liver inflammation and improves NAFLD in mice. Thus, therapies targeting CCR3+ MoMFs may have potential benefits in NAFLD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Radiation therapy (RT) provides therapeutic benefits for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), but inevitably induces poorly understood global changes in GBM and its microenvironment (TME) that promote radio-resistance and recurrence. Through a cell surface marker screen, we identified that CD142 (tissue factor or F3) is robustly induced in the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal)-positive GBM cells after irradiation. F3 promotes clonal expansion of irradiated SA-βGal+ GBM cells and orchestrates oncogenic TME remodeling by activating both tumor-autonomous signaling and extrinsic coagulation pathways. Intratumoral F3 signaling induces a mesenchymal-like cell state transition and elevated chemokine secretion. Simultaneously, F3-mediated focal hypercoagulation states lead to activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. A newly developed F3-targeting agent potently inhibits the aforementioned oncogenic events and impedes tumor relapse in vivo. These findings support F3 as a critical regulator for therapeutic resistance and oncogenic senescence in GBM, opening potential therapeutic avenues.

Abstract: Summary
Tau is a soluble protein interacting with tubulin to stabilize microtubules. However, under pathological conditions, it becomes hyperphosphorylated and aggregates, a process that can be induced by treating cells with exogenously added tau fibrils. Here, we employ single-molecule localization microscopy to resolve the aggregate species formed in early stages of seeded tau aggregation. We report that entry of sufficient tau assemblies into the cytosol induces the self-replication of small tau aggregates, with a doubling time of 5 h inside HEK cells and 1 day in murine primary neurons, which then grow into fibrils. Seeding occurs in the vicinity of the microtubule cytoskeleton, is accelerated by the proteasome, and results in release of small assemblies into the media. In the absence of seeding, cells still spontaneously form small aggregates at lower levels. Overall, our work provides a quantitative picture of the early stages of templated seeded tau aggregation in cells.

Abstract: Summary
The therapeutic administration of recombinant proteins is utilized in a multitude of research studies for treating various diseases. In this study, we investigate the therapeutic potential of Orosomucoid 2 (Orm2), an acute phase protein predominantly secreted by hepatocytes, for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Our results show that high Orm2 expression prevents high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. Pharmacological administration of recombinant ORM2 protein ameliorates hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrosis in mouse livers afflicted by NAFLD and NASH under dietary stress. Orm2 knockout mice develop spontaneous obesity under a regular diet and exacerbate HFD-induced steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. Mechanistically, Orm2 deletion activates the Erk1/2-PPARγ-Cd36 signaling pathway, increasing fatty acid uptake and absorption in hepatocytes and mice. Overall, our findings underscore the critical role of Orm2 in preventing NASH and associated NAFLD in the context of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The sodium-activated Slo2.2 channel is abundantly expressed in the brain, playing a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability. The Na+-binding site and the underlying mechanisms of Na+-dependent activation remain unclear. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human Slo2.2 in closed, open, and inhibitor-bound form at resolutions of 2.6–3.2 Å, revealing gating mechanisms of Slo2.2 regulation by cations and a potent inhibitor. The cytoplasmic gating ring domain of the closed Slo2.2 harbors multiple K+ and Zn2+ sites, which stabilize the channel in the closed conformation. The open Slo2.2 structure reveals at least two Na+-sensitive sites where Na+ binding induces expansion and rotation of the gating ring that opens the inner gate. Furthermore, a potent inhibitor wedges into a pocket formed by pore helix and S6 helix and blocks the pore. Together, our results provide a comprehensive structural framework for the investigation of Slo2.2 channel gating, Na+ sensation, and inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses encode transcriptional regulatory proteins critical for controlling viral and host gene expression. Given their multifunctional nature and high sequence divergence, it is unclear which viral proteins can affect transcription and which specific sequences contribute to this function. Using a high-throughput assay, we measured the transcriptional regulatory potential of over 60,000 protein tiles across ∼1,500 proteins from 11 coronaviruses and all nine human herpesviruses. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional effector domains, including a conserved repression domain in all coronavirus Spike homologs, dual activation-repression domains in viral interferon regulatory factors (VIRFs), and an activation domain in six herpesvirus homologs of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein that we show is important for viral replication and late gene expression in Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). For the effector domains we identified, we investigated their mechanisms via high-throughput sequence and chemical perturbations, pinpointing sequence motifs essential for function. This work massively expands viral protein annotations, serving as a springboard for studying their biological and health implications and providing new candidates for compact gene regulation tools.

Abstract: Summary
The heme-regulated kinase HRI is activated under heme/iron deficient conditions; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we show that iron-deficiency-induced HRI activation requires the mitochondrial protein DELE1. Notably, mitochondrial import of DELE1 and its subsequent protein stability are regulated by iron availability. Under steady-state conditions, DELE1 is degraded by the mitochondrial matrix-resident protease LONP1 soon after mitochondrial import. Upon iron chelation, DELE1 import is arrested, thereby stabilizing DELE1 on the mitochondrial surface to activate the HRI-mediated integrated stress response (ISR). Ablation of this DELE1-HRI-ISR pathway in an erythroid cell model enhances cell death under iron-limited conditions, suggesting a cell-protective role for this pathway in iron-demanding cell lineages. Our findings highlight mitochondrial import regulation of DELE1 as the core component of a previously unrecognized mitochondrial iron responsive pathway that elicits stress signaling following perturbation of iron homeostasis.

Abstract: Diseases, such as bone nonunion with bone defects, osteoporosis, etc, seriously endanger people's quality of life, and bone tissue engineering based on mesenchymal stem cells is an effective method to solve such problems. Several studies have shown that BMP9 can effectively promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Gli1 and Gli2 were important transcription factors and play an important role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the role of Gli1 and Gli2 in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. We found that inhibition of Gli1 and Gli2 weakened BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, and early osteogenic markers (alkaline phosphatase, ALP), late osteogenic markers (calcium salt deposition), the expression of pivotal osteogenic markers were attenuated, and inhibition of Gli1 and Gli2 weakened the expression of p-Smad1/5/8 and p-p38 induced by BMP9. In conclusion, our study shows that Gli1 and Gli2 play an important role in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation.

Abstract: β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) has been shown to play critical roles in the development and maintenance of epithelial cells, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Ctnnb1 is not only a component of intercellular junctions in the epithelium, it also functions as a transcriptional regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway. To identify which of its functional modalities is critically involved in mouse RPE development and maintenance, we varied Ctnnb1 gene content and activity in mouse RPE lineage cells and tested their impacts on mouse eye development. We found that a Ctnnb1 double mutant (Ctnnb1dm), which exhibits impaired transcriptional activity, could not replace Ctnnb1 in the RPE, whereas Ctnnb1Y654E, which has reduced affinity for the junctions, could do so. Expression of the constitutively active Ctnnb1∆ex3 mutant also suppressed the development of RPE, instead facilitating a ciliary cell fate. However, the post-mitotic or mature RPE was insensitive to the loss, inactivation, or constitutive activation of Ctnnb1. Collectively, our results suggest that Ctnnb1 should be maintained within an optimal range to specify RPE through transcriptional regulation of Wnt target genes in the optic neuroepithelium.

Abstract: Summary
Karrikins (KARs) were first identified as a class of small-molecule chemicals derived from smoke that promote seed germination. However, the implied mechanism is still not well understood. Here, we find that KAR signaling mutants have a lower germination percentage than that of wild type under weak light conditions, and KARs promote seed germination through transcriptional activation of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis via SMAX1. SMAX1 interacts with the DELLA proteins REPRESSOR of ga1-3-LIKE 1 (RGL1) and RGL3. The interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of SMAX1 and inhibits GIBBERELLIN 3-oxidase 2 (GA3ox2) gene expression. The KAR signaling mutant seed germination defect under weak light is partially rescued by exogenous application of GA3 or by GA3ox2 overexpression, and the rgl1 rgl3 smax1 triple mutant exhibits higher germination rates under weak light than the smax1 mutant. Thus, we show a crosstalk between KAR and GA signaling pathways via a SMAX1-DELLA module in regulating seed germination in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
How pathogens manipulate host UPRER to mediate immune evasion is largely unknown. Here, we identify the host zinc finger protein ZPR1 as an interacting partner of the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) effector NleE using proximity-enabled protein crosslinking. We show that ZPR1 assembles via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and regulates CHOP-mediated UPRER at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, in vitro studies show that the ZPR1 binding ability with K63-ubiquitin chains, which promotes LLPS of ZPR1, is disrupted by NleE. Further analyses indicate that EPEC restricts host UPRER pathways at the transcription level in a NleE-ZPR1 cascade-dependent manner. Together, our study reveals the mechanism by which EPEC interferes with CHOP-UPRER via regulating ZPR1 to help pathogens escape host defense.

Abstract: Summary
An abnormal glutamate signaling pathway has been proposed in the mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, less is known about the involvement of alterations of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) in the pathophysiology of ASD. We show that the transcript level of GLS1 is significantly decreased in the postmortem frontal cortex and peripheral blood of ASD subjects. Mice lacking Gls1 in CamKIIα-positive neurons display a series of ASD-like behaviors, synaptic excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) imbalance, higher spine density, and glutamate receptor expression in the prefrontal cortex, as well as a compromised expression pattern of genes involved in synapse pruning and less engulfed synaptic puncta in microglia. A low dose of lipopolysaccharide treatment restores microglial synapse pruning, corrects synaptic neurotransmission, and rescues behavioral deficits in these mice. In summary, these findings provide mechanistic insights into Gls1 loss in ASD symptoms and identify Gls1 as a target for the treatment of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in lateral root (LR) development, but how ABA signaling interacts with auxin signaling to regulate LR formation is not well understood. Here, we report that ABA-responsive ERF1 mediates the crosstalk between ABA and auxin signaling to regulate Arabidopsis LR emergence. ABI3 is a negative factor in LR emergence and transcriptionally activates ERF1 by binding to its promoter, and reciprocally, ERF1 activates ABI3, which forms a regulatory loop that enables rapid signal amplification. Notably, ABI3 physically interacts with ERF1, reducing the cis element-binding activities of both ERF1 and ABI3 and thus attenuating the expression of ERF1-/ABI3-regulated genes involved in LR emergence and ABA signaling, such as PIN1, AUX1, ARF7, and ABI5, which may provide a molecular rheostat to avoid overamplification of auxin and ABA signaling. Taken together, our findings identify the role of the ABI3-ERF1 module in mediating crosstalk between ABA and auxin signaling in LR emergence.

Abstract: Summary
Co-transcriptional capping of the nascent pre-mRNA 5′ end prevents degradation of RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcripts and suppresses the innate immune response. Here, we provide mechanistic insights into the three major steps of human co-transcriptional pre-mRNA capping based on six different cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures. The human mRNA capping enzyme, RNGTT, first docks to the Pol II stalk to position its triphosphatase domain near the RNA exit site. The capping enzyme then moves onto the Pol II surface, and its guanylyltransferase receives the pre-mRNA 5′-diphosphate end. Addition of a GMP moiety can occur when the RNA is ∼22 nt long, sufficient to reach the active site of the guanylyltransferase. For subsequent cap(1) methylation, the methyltransferase CMTR1 binds the Pol II stalk and can receive RNA after it is grown to ∼29 nt in length. The observed rearrangements of capping factors on the Pol II surface may be triggered by the completion of catalytic reaction steps and are accommodated by domain movements in the elongation factor DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF).

Abstract: Summary
While rhythmic contractile behavior is commonly observed at the cellular cortex, the primary focus has been on excitable or periodic events described by simple activator-delayed inhibitor mechanisms. We show that Rho GTPase activation in nocodazole-treated mitotic cells exhibits both simple oscillations and complex mixed-mode oscillations. Rho oscillations with a 20- to 30-s period are regulated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) via an activator-delayed inhibitor mechanism, while a slow reaction with period of minutes is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase via an activator-substrate depletion mechanism. Conversion from simple to complex oscillations can be induced by modulating PIP3 metabolism or altering membrane contact site protein E-Syt1. PTEN depletion results in a period-doubling intermediate, which, like mixed-mode oscillations, is an intermediate state toward chaos. In sum, this system operates at the edge of chaos. Small changes in phosphoinositide metabolism can confer cells with the flexibility to rapidly enter ordered states with different periodicities.

Abstract: Summary
The preservation of female fertility under unfavorable conditions is essential for animal reproduction. Inhibition of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is indispensable for Drosophila young egg chamber maintenance under nutrient starvation. Here, we show that knockdown of RagA results in young egg chamber death independent of TORC1 hyperactivity. RagA RNAi ovaries have autolysosomal acidification and degradation defects, which make the young egg chambers sensitive to autophagosome augmentation. Meanwhile, RagA RNAi ovaries have nuclear-localized Mitf, which promotes autophagic degradation and protects young egg chambers under stress. Interestingly, GDP-bound RagA rescues autolysosome defects, while GTP-bound RagA rescues Mitf nuclear localization in RagA RNAi young egg chambers. Moreover, Rag GTPase activity, rather than TORC1 activity, controls Mitf cellular localization in the Drosophila germ line. Our work suggests that RagA separately controls autolysosomal acidification and Mitf activity in the Drosophila young egg chambers.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment options for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma are limited and lack an efficient targeted drug combination that significantly increases overall and progression-free survival. In addition, targeted therapy success is hampered by the inevitable emergence of drug resistance. A thorough understanding of the molecular processes driving cancer cells’ escape mechanisms is crucial to tailor more efficient follow-up therapies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of NRAS-mutant melanoma treated with MEK1/2 plus CDK4/6 inhibitors to decipher transcriptional transitions during the development of drug resistance. Cell lines resuming full proliferation (FACs [fast-adapting cells]) and cells that became senescent (SACs [slow-adapting cells]) over prolonged treatment were identified. The early drug response was characterized by transitional states involving increased ion signaling, driven by upregulation of the ATP-gated ion channel P2RX7. P2RX7 activation was associated with improved therapy responses and, in combination with targeted drugs, could contribute to the delayed onset of acquired resistance in NRAS-mutant melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic regulation of integrin activation and inactivation is critical for precisely controlled cell adhesion and migration in physiological and pathological processes. The molecular basis for integrin activation has been intensively studied; however, the understanding of integrin inactivation is still limited. Here, we identify LRP12 as an endogenous transmembrane inhibitor for α4 integrin activation. The LRP12 cytoplasmic domain directly binds to the integrin α4 cytoplasmic tail and inhibits talin binding to the β subunit, thus keeping integrin inactive. In migrating cells, LRP12-α4 interaction induces nascent adhesion (NA) turnover at the leading-edge protrusion. Knockdown of LRP12 leads to increased NAs and enhanced cell migration. Consistently, LRP12-deficient T cells show an enhanced homing capability in mice and lead to aggravated chronic colitis in a T cell-transfer colitis model. Altogether, LRP12 is a transmembrane inactivator for integrins that inhibits α4 integrin activation and controls cell migration by maintaining balanced NA dynamics.

Abstract: Cervical cancer (CC) ranks the fourth in gynecologic cancers. The incidence and mortality of CC has been decreased due to the cancer screening and early treatments in recent years, but the prognosis of CC patients at advanced stage is still sorrowful. Whether PSME3 exerted a role in the radioresistance of CC cells remains to be investigated. In this study, the expression of PSME3 in mRNA and protein levels was measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, and increased expression of PSME3 in CC tissues and cells was observed. CCK-8 and colony formation assay revealed that the cell viability and proliferation of Hela and CaSki cells treated with different doses of X-ray was reduced due to the depletion of PSME3, indicating that silencing of PSME3 enhanced the radiosensitivity of CC cells. In addition, repair on DNA damage in CC cells was enhanced by PSME3 and the damage was attenuated by PSME3. Besides, the expression of glycolysis-related proteins (GLUT1, PGC-1α, LDHA and HK2) were enhanced by PSME3 but reduced by silencing PSME3 in CC cells. PSME3 restraint attenuated the levels of glucose consumption and lactate production, suggesting PSME3 depletion suppressed abnormal glycolysis of CC cells. Mechanically, PSME3 increased the PARP1 expression via elevating c-myc. Finally, we observed PSME3 attenuation inhibited CC growth in vivo. In conclusion, PSME3 enhanced radioresistance and aerobic glycolysis in CC by regulating PARP1, which might shed a light into the function of PSME3 in CC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease, and the cellular and molecular evolution from precursor conditions, including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma, is incompletely understood. Here, we combine single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing from fifty-two patients with myeloma precursors in comparison with myeloma and normal donors. Our comprehensive analysis reveals early genomic drivers of malignant transformation, distinct transcriptional features, and divergent clonal expansion in hyperdiploid versus non-hyperdiploid samples. Additionally, we observe intra-patient heterogeneity with potential therapeutic implications and identify distinct patterns of evolution from myeloma precursor disease to myeloma. We also demonstrate distinctive characteristics of the microenvironment associated with specific genomic changes in myeloma cells. These findings add to our knowledge about myeloma precursor disease progression, providing valuable insights into patient risk stratification, biomarker discovery, and possible clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation and thermogenesis in white adipose tissue (WAT) at different sites influence the overall effects of obesity on metabolic health. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), inflammatory responses are less pronounced in inguinal WAT (ingWAT) than in epididymal WAT (epiWAT). Here we show that ablation and activation of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) oppositely affect the expression of inflammation-related genes and the formation of crown-like structures by infiltrating macrophages in ingWAT, but not in epiWAT, of HFD-fed mice, with these effects being mediated by sympathetic nerves innervating ingWAT. In contrast, SF1 neurons of the VMH preferentially regulated the expression of thermogenesis-related genes in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of HFD-fed mice. These results suggest that SF1 neurons of the VMH differentially regulate inflammatory responses and thermogenesis among various adipose tissue depots and restrain inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity specifically in ingWAT.

Abstract: It is well known that diabetes is associated with impairment of ovarian and testicular structure and function. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is identified as one of the oldest herbal plants valued for its nutritional and medicinal properties. This work is mainly designed to evaluate the possible modulatory role of dry coriander fruit extract against gonadal impairments associated with diabetes in female rats and their pups. Twenty-four pregnant rats were divided into four groups (n = 6): group I served as control, group II was administered daily with coriander fruit extract (250 mg/kg b.wt), group III was injected interaperitoneally with a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (80 mg/kg b.wt), and group IV was injected with single dose of STZ and post administered coriander extract. The experiment was conducted from the 4th day of gestation till the end of weaning. At the end of the experiment, the mothers’ rats and their offspring were weighed, sacrificed, the ovaries from mothers as well as ovaries and testes from offspring were immediately excised, and processed for histological, immunohistochemical and evaluation of apoptosis and transforming growth factorβ (TGF-β). Also, blood samples were collected and analyzed to estimate the levels of sex hormones as well as antioxidants.In STZ induced diabetes in mother's rats and their offspring, the ovarian sections revealed severe histopathological signs included several atretic follicles, dilated and congested blood capillaries. Additionally, the testicular sections of offspring appeared with destructive seminiferous tubules. Immunohistochemically, the ovarian sections displayed weak to negative expression for calretinin marker however the testicular sections showed strong expression for Bax protein (apoptotic marker) and weak to negative expression for Ki67 protein (proliferative marker). Also, the mean % values of positively expressed cells for TGF-β and annexin-v markers (late and early apoptosis indicator) were significantly elevated in the ovarian and testicular tissues of STZ-induced group of mother's rats and their pups if compared with control. Further results revealed that the levels of insulin, FSH, LH, estrogen, SOD and CAT were significantly decreased if compared with control however the levels of MDA and NO were significantly elevated. Administration of coriander fruit extract to diabetic rats successfully alleviated most of the altered histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and apoptotic changes induced by diabetes. Coriandrum sativum fruit extract has a powerful ameliorative role against STZ-induced diabetic gonadal dysfunctions in female rats and their offspring.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an essential cellular process that is deeply integrated with innate immune signaling; however, studies that examine the impact of autophagic modulation in the context of inflammatory conditions are lacking. Here, using mice with a constitutively active variant of the autophagy gene Beclin1, we show that increased autophagy dampens cytokine production during a model of macrophage activation syndrome and in adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) infection. Moreover, loss of functional autophagy through conditional deletion of Beclin1 in myeloid cells significantly enhances innate immunity in these contexts. We further analyzed primary macrophages from these animals with a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics to identify mechanistic targets downstream of autophagy. Our study reveals glutamine/glutathione metabolism and the RNF128/TBK1 axis as independent regulators of inflammation. Altogether, our work highlights increased autophagic flux as a potential approach to reduce inflammation and defines independent mechanistic cascades involved in this control.

Abstract: Summary
Kinetochore is an essential protein complex required for accurate chromosome segregation. The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), a subcomplex of the kinetochore, associates with centromeric chromatin and provides a platform for the kinetochore assembly. The CCAN protein CENP-C is thought to be a central hub for the centromere/kinetochore organization. However, the role of CENP-C in CCAN assembly needs to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that both the CCAN-binding domain and the C-terminal region that includes the Cupin domain of CENP-C are necessary and sufficient for chicken CENP-C function. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal self-oligomerization of the Cupin domains of chicken and human CENP-C. We find that the CENP-C Cupin domain oligomerization is vital for CENP-C function, centromeric localization of CCAN, and centromeric chromatin organization. These results suggest that CENP-C facilitates the centromere/kinetochore assembly through its oligomerization.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular quantitative trait loci (xQTLs) are often harnessed to prioritize genes or functional elements underpinning variant-trait associations identified from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Here, we introduce OPERA, a method that jointly analyzes GWAS and multi-omics xQTL summary statistics to enhance the identification of molecular phenotypes associated with complex traits through shared causal variants. Applying OPERA to summary-level GWAS data for 50 complex traits (n = 20,833–766,345) and xQTL data from seven omics layers (n = 100–31,684) reveals that 50% of the GWAS signals are shared with at least one molecular phenotype. GWAS signals shared with multiple molecular phenotypes, such as those at the MSMB locus for prostate cancer, are particularly informative for understanding the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits. Future studies with more molecular phenotypes, measured considering spatiotemporal effects in larger samples, are required to obtain a more saturated map linking molecular intermediates to GWAS signals.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-21 (IL-21) plays a critical role in generating immunological memory by promoting the germinal center reaction, yet clinical use of IL-21 remains challenging because of its pleiotropy and association with autoimmune disease. To better understand the structural basis of IL-21 signaling, we determine the structure of the IL-21–IL-21R–γc ternary signaling complex by X-ray crystallography and a structure of a dimer of trimeric complexes using cryo-electron microscopy. Guided by the structure, we design analogs of IL-21 by introducing substitutions to the IL-21–γc interface. These IL-21 analogs act as partial agonists that modulate downstream activation of pS6, pSTAT3, and pSTAT1. These analogs exhibit differential activity on T and B cell subsets and modulate antibody production in human tonsil organoids. These results clarify the structural basis of IL-21 signaling and offer a potential strategy for tunable manipulation of humoral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic plasticity is hypothesized to underlie “replay” of salient experience during hippocampal sharp-wave/ripple (SWR)-based ensemble activity and to facilitate systems-level memory consolidation coordinated by SWRs and cortical sleep spindles. It remains unclear how molecular changes at synapses contribute to experience-induced modification of network function. The synaptic protein KIBRA regulates plasticity and memory. To determine the impact of KIBRA-regulated plasticity on circuit dynamics, we recorded in vivo neural activity from wild-type (WT) mice and littermates lacking KIBRA and examined circuit function before, during, and after novel experience. In WT mice, experience altered population activity and oscillatory dynamics in a manner consistent with incorporation of new information content in replay and enhanced hippocampal-cortical communication. While baseline SWR features were normal in KIBRA conditional knockout (cKO) mice, experience-dependent alterations in SWRs were absent. Furthermore, intra-hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical communication during SWRs was disrupted following KIBRA deletion. These results indicate molecular mechanisms that underlie network-level adaptations to experience.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common liver cancer, occurs mainly in men, but the underlying mechanism remains to be further explored. Here, we report that ubiquitinated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is responsible for HCC tumorigenesis in males. Mechanistically, FBXW10 promotes GAPDH polyubiquitination and activation; VRK2-dependent phosphorylation of GAPDH Ser151 residue is critical for GAPDH ubiquitination and activation. Activated GAPDH interacts with TRAF2, leading to upregulation of the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, and increases PD-L1 and AR-VRK2 expression, followed by induction of immune evasion, HCC tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Notably, the GAPDH inhibitor koningic acid (KA) activates immune response and protects against FBXW10-driven HCC in vivo. In HCC clinical samples, the expression of active GAPDH is positively correlated with that of FBXW10 and VRK2. We propose that the FBXW10/AR/VRK2/GAPDH/NF-κB axis is critical for HCC tumorigenesis in males. Targeting this axis with KA is a potential therapeutic strategy for male HCC patients.

Abstract: Summary
XIST RNA triggers chromosome-wide gene silencing and condenses an active chromosome into a Barr body. Here, we use inducible human XIST to examine early steps in the process, showing that XIST modifies cytoarchitecture before widespread gene silencing. In just 2–4 h, barely visible transcripts populate the large “sparse zone” surrounding the smaller “dense zone”; importantly, density zones exhibit different chromatin impacts. Sparse transcripts immediately trigger immunofluorescence for H2AK119ub and CIZ1, a matrix protein. H3K27me3 appears hours later in the dense zone, which enlarges with chromosome condensation. Genes examined are silenced after compaction of the RNA/DNA territory. Insights into this come from the findings that the A-repeat alone can silence genes and rapidly, but only where dense RNA supports sustained histone deacetylation. We propose that sparse XIST RNA quickly impacts architectural elements to condense the largely non-coding chromosome, coalescing RNA density that facilitates an unstable, A-repeat-dependent step required for gene silencing.

Abstract: The testis is a key male reproductive organ that produces gametes through the process of spermatogenesis. Testis morphologies, sperm phenotypes, and the process of spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to give rise to their own offspring. Here, we review studies illuminating the molecular evolution of the testis, in particular large-scale transcriptomic studies, which were based on bulk tissue samples and, more recently, individual cells. Together with various genomic and epigenomic data, these studies have unveiled the cellular source, molecular mechanisms, and evolutionary forces that underlie the rapid phenotypic evolution of the testis. They also revealed shared (ancestral) and species-specific spermatogenic gene expression programs. The insights and available data that have accumulated also provide a valuable resource for the investigation and treatment of male fertility disorders – a dramatically increasing problem in modern industrial societies.

Abstract: Summary
The neural circuit mechanisms underlying postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) remain elusive. We hypothesized that projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the amygdala are involved in POCD. A mouse model of POCD in which isoflurane (1.5%) combined with laparotomy was used. Virally assisted tracing techniques were used to label the relevant pathways. Fear conditioning, immunofluorescence, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, and chemogenetic and optogenetic techniques were applied to investigate the role of mPFC-amygdala projections in POCD. We find that surgery impairs memory consolidation but not retrieval of consolidated memories. In POCD mice, the glutamatergic pathway from the prelimbic cortex to the basolateral amygdala (PL-BLA) shows reduced activity, whereas the glutamatergic pathway from the infralimbic cortex to the basomedial amygdala (IL-BMA) shows enhanced activity. Our study indicates that the hypoactivity in the PL-BLA pathway interrupts memory consolidation, whereas the hyperactivity in the IL-BMA promotes memory extinction, in POCD mice.

Abstract: Summary
Copy-number variations (CNVs) of the human 16p11.2 genetic locus are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia. However, it remains largely unclear how this locus is involved in the disease pathogenesis. Doc2α is localized within this locus. Here, using in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological and morphological approaches, we show that Doc2α-deficient mice have neuronal morphological abnormalities and defects in neural activity. Moreover, the Doc2α-deficient mice exhibit social and repetitive behavioral deficits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Doc2α functions in behavioral and neural phenotypes through interaction with Secretagogin (SCGN). Finally, we demonstrate that SCGN functions in social/repetitive behaviors, glutamate release, and neuronal morphology of the mice through its Doc2α-interacting activity. Therefore, Doc2α likely contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders through its interaction with SCGN.

Abstract: The prevalence of mouth breathing is high in children and adolescents. It causes various changes to the respiratory tract and, consequently, craniofacial growth deformities. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to these effects are obscure. Herein, we aimed to study the effects of mouth breathing on chondrocyte proliferation and death in the condylar cartilage and morphological changes in the mandible and condyle. Additionally, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying chondrocyte apoptosis and investigate any variations in the related pathways. Subchondral bone resorption and decreased condylar cartilage thickness were observed in mouth-breathing rats; further, mRNA expression levels of Collagen II, Aggrecan, and Sox 9 were lower in the mouth breathing group, while those of matrix metalloproteinase 9 increased. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling staining and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that apoptosis occurred in the proliferative and hypertrophic layers of cartilage in the mouth breathing group. TNF, BAX, cytochrome c, and cleaved-caspase-3 were highly expressed in the condylar cartilage of the mouth-breathing rats. These results suggest that mouth breathing leads to subchondral bone resorption, cartilage layer thinning, and cartilage matrix destruction, inducing chondrocyte apoptosis via both the extrinsic and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The type V-K CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) allow RNA-guided DNA integration and have great potential as a programmable site-specific gene insertion tool. Although all core components have been independently characterized structurally, the mechanism of how the transposase TnsB associates with AAA+ ATPase TnsC and catalyzes donor DNA cleavage and integration remains ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrate that TniQ-dCas9 fusion can direct site-specific transposition by TnsB/TnsC in ShCAST. TnsB is a 3′-5′ exonuclease that specifically cleaves donor DNA at the end of the terminal repeats and integrates the left end prior to the right end. The nucleotide preference and the cleavage site of TnsB are markedly different from those of the well-documented MuA. We also find that TnsB/TnsC association is enhanced in a half-integration state. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the mechanism and application expansion of CRISPR-mediated site-specific transposition by TnsB/TnsC.

Abstract: One of the biggest factors that negatively affect the cancer treatment plan is the toxic effects of chemotherapeutics on non-target cells and tissues. This information prompted us to investigate the protective effects of silymarin (SL), a hepatoprotective agent, against the hepatotoxic effects of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PAC). Four groups were formed from 28 rats as control, PAC (2 mg/kg), SL (100 mg/kg) and PAC + SL (combination of PAC with SL). After completing the experimental procedures, the tissues collected after anesthesia were analyzed by Western blot, qRT-PCR, biochemical, stereological, immunohistochemical, and histopathological techniques. Administration of PAC significantly increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Bax, cytochrome-c (cyt-c), and active caspase-3, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver tissue and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels compared with the control group. PAC also resulted in a significant increase in serum triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (CH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels compared with the control group. Pathological changes such as microvesicular steatosis, the formation of Councilman bodies, an increase in total sinusoidal volume, and a decrease in the total number of hepatocytes were observed in the liver tissue of the PAC group. Almost all analysis results in the PAC + SL group were similar to those in the control group, and no significant pathological alterations were observed in this group. The data obtained show that SL protects the liver from the harmful effects of PAC, especially thanks to its TNF-α suppressor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects. Based on this result, in cases where PAC is used in cancer treatment, it can be recommended to be used together with SL to prevent harmful effects on healthy liver tissue and to continue treatment uninterruptedly and effectively.

Abstract: Summary
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) rapidly clear lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bloodstream and establish intimate contact with immune cells. However, their role in regulating liver inflammation remains poorly understood. We show that LSECs modify their chemokine expression profile driven by LPS or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), resulting in the production of the myeloid- or lymphoid-attracting chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10, respectively, which accumulate in the serum of LPS-challenged animals. Natural killer (NK) cell exposure to LSECs in vitro primes NK cells for higher production of IFN-γ in response to interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18. In livers of LPS-injected mice, NK cells are the major producers of this cytokine. In turn, LSECs require exposure to IFN-γ for CXCL10 expression, and endothelial-specific Cxcl10 gene deletion curtails NK cell accumulation in the inflamed livers. Thus, LSECs respond to both LPS and immune-derived signals and fuel a positive feedback loop of immune cell attraction and activation in the inflamed liver tissue.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of blindness in elderly individuals. However, the currently used intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor are invasive, and repetitive injections are also accompanied by a risk of intraocular infection. The pathogenic mechanism of AMD is still not completely understood, but a multifactorial mechanism that combines genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including cellular senescence, has been suggested. Cellular senescence refers to the accumulation of cells that stop dividing due to the presence of free radicals and DNA damage. Characteristics of senescent cells include nuclear hypertrophy, increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors such as p16 and p21, and resistance to apoptosis. Senolytic drugs remove senescent cells by targeting the main characteristics of these cells. One of the senolytic drugs, ABT-263, which inhibits the antiapoptotic functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, may be a new treatment for AMD patients because it targets senescent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. We proved that it selectively kills doxorubicin (Dox)-induced senescent ARPE-19 cells by activating apoptosis. By removing senescent cells, the expression of inflammatory cytokines was reduced, and the proliferation of the remaining cells was increased. When ABT-263 was orally administered to the mouse model of senescent RPE cells induced by Dox, we confirmed that senescent RPE cells were selectively removed and retinal degeneration was alleviated. Therefore, we suggest that ABT-263, which removes senescent RPE cells through its senolytic effect, has the potential to be the first orally administered senolytic drug for the treatment of AMD.

Abstract: Summary
The multiple roles of TGR5 in the regulation of glucose metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress have drawn attention as therapeutic candidates for diabetes-related kidney disease. However, diabetes induces downregulation of renal TGR5 protein expression, and the regulatory mechanisms have not been clarified. Here, we identify that Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a critical interactor of TGR5 and mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TGR5 under high glucose stimulation in glomerular mesangial cells. Genetic deficiency of Smurf1 restores TGR5 protein expression and attenuates renal injuries in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, Smurf1 interacts with the TGR5 ICL2 region by its HECT domain and induces K11/K48-linked polyubiquitination of TGR5 at K306 residue. Moreover, restoration of TGR5 protects db/db mice from diabetic nephropathy. These observations elucidate the critical role of Smurf1 in regulating TGR5 stability, suggesting that pharmacological targeting of the interaction between Smurf1 and TGR5 could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy against diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Summary
The neural code of faces has been intensively studied in the macaque face patch system. Although the majority of previous studies used complete faces as stimuli, faces are often seen partially in daily life. Here, we investigated how face-selective cells represent two types of incomplete faces: face fragments and occluded faces, with the location of the fragment/occluder and the facial features systematically varied. Contrary to popular belief, we found that the preferred face regions identified with two stimulus types are dissociated in many face cells. This dissociation can be explained by the nonlinear integration of information from different face parts and is closely related to a curved representation of face completeness in the state space, which allows a clear discrimination between different stimulus types. Furthermore, identity-related facial features are represented in a subspace orthogonal to the nonlinear dimension of face completeness, supporting a condition-general code of facial identity.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional effector domains of transcription factors play a key role in controlling gene expression; however, their functional nature is poorly understood, hampering our ability to explore this fundamental dimension of gene regulatory networks. To map the trans-regulatory landscape in a complex eukaryote, we systematically characterized the putative transcriptional effector domains of over 400 Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors for their capacity to modulate transcription. We demonstrate that transcriptional effector activity can be integrated into gene regulatory networks capable of elucidating the functional dynamics underlying gene expression patterns. We further show how our characterized domains can enhance genome engineering efforts and reveal how plant transcriptional activators share regulatory features conserved across distantly related eukaryotes. Our results provide a framework to systematically characterize the regulatory role of transcription factors at a genome-scale in order to understand the transcriptional wiring of biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
A primary obstacle in translating genetic associations with disease into therapeutic strategies is elucidating the cellular programs affected by genetic risk variants and effector genes. Here, we introduce LipocyteProfiler, a cardiometabolic-disease-oriented high-content image-based profiling tool that enables evaluation of thousands of morphological and cellular profiles that can be systematically linked to genes and genetic variants relevant to cardiometabolic disease. We show that LipocyteProfiler allows surveillance of diverse cellular programs by generating rich context- and process-specific cellular profiles across hepatocyte and adipocyte cell-state transitions. We use LipocyteProfiler to identify known and novel cellular mechanisms altered by polygenic risk of metabolic disease, including insulin resistance, fat distribution, and the polygenic contribution to lipodystrophy. LipocyteProfiler paves the way for large-scale forward and reverse deep phenotypic profiling in lipocytes and provides a framework for the unbiased identification of causal relationships between genetic variants and cellular programs relevant to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging new evidence highlights the importance of prolonged daily fasting periods for the health and survival benefits of calorie restriction (CR) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) in male mice; however, little is known about the impact of these feeding regimens in females. We placed 14-month-old female mice on five different dietary regimens, either CR or TRF with different feeding windows, and determined the effects of these regimens on physiological responses, progression of neoplasms and inflammatory diseases, serum metabolite levels, and lifespan. Compared with TRF feeding, CR elicited a robust systemic response, as it relates to energetics and healthspan metrics, a unique serum metabolomics signature in overnight fasted animals, and was associated with an increase in lifespan. These results indicate that daytime (rest-phase) feeding with prolonged fasting periods initiated late in life confer greater benefits when combined with imposed lower energy intake.

Abstract: Summary
AKT kinase is a key regulator in cell metabolism and survival, and its activation is strictly modulated. Herein, we identify XAF1 (XIAP-associated factor) as a direct interacting protein of AKT1, which strongly binds the N-terminal region of AKT1 to block its K63-linked poly-ubiquitination and subsequent activation. Consistently, Xaf1 knockout causes AKT activation in mouse muscle and fat tissues and reduces body weight gain and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet. Pathologically, XAF1 expression is low and anti-correlated with the phosphorylated p-T308-AKT signal in prostate cancer samples, and Xaf1 knockout stimulates the p-T308-AKT signal to accelerate spontaneous prostate tumorigenesis in mice with Pten heterozygous loss. And ectopic expression of wild-type XAF1, but not the cancer-derived P277L mutant, inhibits orthotopic tumorigenesis. We further identify Forkhead box O 1 (FOXO1) as a transcriptional regulator of XAF1, thus forming a negative feedback loop between AKT1 and XAF1. These results reveal an important intrinsic regulatory mechanism of AKT signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Neuraminidase is suggested as an important component for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Targeted induction of neuraminidase-specific broadly protective antibodies by vaccinations is challenging. To overcome this, we rationally select the highly conserved peptides from the consensus amino acid sequence of the globular head domains of neuraminidase. Inspired by the B cell receptor evolution process, a reliable sequential immunization regimen is designed to result in immuno-focusing by steering bulk immune responses to a selected region where broadly protective B lymphocyte epitopes reside. After priming neuraminidase protein-specific antibody responses in C57BL/6 or BALB/c inbred mice strains by immunization or pre-infection, boost immunizations with certain neuraminidase-derived peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates significantly strengthened serum neuraminidase inhibition activities and cross-protections. Overall, this study provides proof of concept for a peptide-based sequential immunization strategy for achieving targeted induction of cross-protective antibody response, which provides references for designing universal vaccines against other highly variable pathogens.

Abstract: Cysteine proteases orchestrate bone remodeling, and are inhibited by cystatins. In reinforcing our hypothesis that exogenous and naturally obtained inhibitors of cysteine proteases (cystatins) act on bone remodeling, we decided to challenge osteoblasts with sugarcane-derived cystatin (CaneCPI-5) for up to 7 days. To this end, we investigated molecular issues related to the decisive, preliminary stages of osteoblast biology, such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Our data showed that CaneCPI-5 negatively modulates both cofilin phosphorylation at Ser03, and the increase in cytoskeleton remodeling during the adhesion mechanism, possibly as a prerequisite to controlling cell proliferation and migration. This is mainly because CaneCPI-5 also caused the overexpression of the CDK2 gene, and greater migration of osteoblasts. Extracellular matrix remodeling was also evaluated in this study by investigating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities. Our data showed that CaneCPI-5 overstimulates both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, and suggested that this cellular event could be related to osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, differentiation mechanisms were better evaluated by investigating Osterix and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) genes, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling members. Altogether, our data showed that CaneCPI-5 can trigger biological mechanisms related to osteoblast differentiation, and broaden the perspectives for better exploring biotechnological approaches for bone disorders.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control RNA metabolism to orchestrate gene expression and, when dysfunctional, underlie human diseases. Proteome-wide discovery efforts predict thousands of RBP candidates, many of which lack canonical RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Here, we present a hybrid ensemble RBP classifier (HydRA), which leverages information from both intermolecular protein interactions and internal protein sequence patterns to predict RNA-binding capacity with unparalleled specificity and sensitivity using support vector machines (SVMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformer-based protein language models. Occlusion mapping by HydRA robustly detects known RBDs and predicts hundreds of uncharacterized RNA-binding associated domains. Enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) for HydRA-predicted RBP candidates reveals transcriptome-wide RNA targets and confirms RNA-binding activity for HydRA-predicted RNA-binding associated domains. HydRA accelerates construction of a comprehensive RBP catalog and expands the diversity of RNA-binding associated domains.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular homeostasis relies on both the chaperoning of proteins and the intracellular degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to the lysosome, a process known as autophagy. The crosstalk between these processes and their underlying regulatory mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) forms a complex with the autophagy-initiating kinase Atg1 (yeast)/Ulk1 (mammalian), which suppresses its kinase activity. Conversely, environmental cues lead to Atg1/Ulk1-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved serine in the amino domain of Hsp90, inhibiting its ATPase activity and altering the chaperone dynamics. These events impact a conformotypic peptide adjacent to the activation and catalytic loop of Atg1/Ulk1. Finally, Atg1/Ulk1-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp90 leads to dissociation of the Hsp90:Atg1/Ulk1 complex and activation of Atg1/Ulk1, which is essential for initiation of autophagy. Our work indicates a reciprocal regulatory mechanism between the chaperone Hsp90 and the autophagy kinase Atg1/Ulk1 and consequent maintenance of cellular proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
How reciprocal regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism works is a long-standing question. In plants, glucose and nitrate are proposed to act as signaling molecules, regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism via largely unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that the MYB-related transcription factor ARE4 coordinates glucose signaling and nitrogen utilization in rice. ARE4 is retained in the cytosol in complexing with the glucose sensor OsHXK7. Upon sensing a glucose signal, ARE4 is released, is translocated into the nucleus, and activates the expression of a subset of high-affinity nitrate transporter genes, thereby boosting nitrate uptake and accumulation. This regulatory scheme displays a diurnal pattern in response to circadian changes of soluble sugars. The are4 mutations compromise in nitrate utilization and plant growth, whereas overexpression of ARE4 increases grain size. We propose that the OsHXK7-ARE4 complex links glucose to the transcriptional regulation of nitrogen utilization, thereby coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

Abstract: The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an innate immune C-type lectin receptor that recognizes carbohydrate-based pathogen associated with molecular patterns of various bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa. Although a range of highly mannosylated glycoproteins have been shown to induce signaling via DC-SIGN, precise structure of the recognized oligosaccharide epitope is still unclear. Using the array of oligosaccharides related to selected fragments of main fungal antigenic polysaccharides we revealed a highly specific pentamannoside ligand of DC-SIGN, consisting of α-(1 → 2)-linked mannose chains with one inner α-(1 → 3)-linked unit. This structural motif is present in Candida albicans cell wall mannan and corresponds to its antigenic factors 4 and 13b. This epitope is not ubiquitous in other yeast species and may account for the species-specific nature of fungal recognition via DC-SIGN. The discovered highly specific oligosaccharide ligands of DC-SIGN are tractable tools for interdisciplinary investigations of mechanisms of fungal innate immunity and anti-Candida defense. Ligand- and receptor-based NMR data demonstrated the pentasaccharide-to-DC-SIGN interaction in solution and enabled the deciphering of the interaction topology.
