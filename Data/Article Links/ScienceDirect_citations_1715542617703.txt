Abstract: Background
Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme dedicated to phosphorylate and activate myosin II to provide force for various motile processes. In smooth muscle cells and many other cells, small MLCK (S-MLCK) is a major isoform. S-MLCK is an actomyosin-binding protein firmly attached to contractile machinery in smooth muscle cells. Still, it can leave this location and contribute to other cellular processes. However, molecular mechanisms for switching the S-MLCK subcellular localization have not been described.
Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro protein phosphorylation were used to study functional roles of discrete in-vivo phosphorylated residues within the S-MLCK actin-binding domain. In vitro co-sedimentation analysis was applied to study the interaction of recombinant S-MLCK actin-binding fragment with filamentous actin. Subcellular distribution of phosphomimicking S-MLCK mutants was studied by fluorescent microscopy and differential cell extraction.
Results
Phosphorylation of S-MLCK actin-binding domain at Ser25 and/or Thr56 by proline-directed protein kinases or phosphomimicking these posttranslational modifications alters S-MLCK binding to actin filaments both in vitro and in cells, and induces S-MLCK subcellular translocation with no effect on the enzyme catalytic properties.
Conclusions
Phosphorylation of the amino terminal actin-binding domain of S-MLCK renders differential subcellular targeting of the enzyme and may, thereby, contribute to a variety of context-dependent responses of S-MLCK to cellular and tissue stimuli.
General significance
S-MLCK physiological function can potentially be modulated via phosphorylation of its actin recognition domain, a regulation distinct from the catalytic and calmodulin regulatory domains.

Abstract: Objective/background
Mutations in transmembrane protease serine 6 (TMPRSS6) gene induce high hepcidin level, which causes iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) by preventing duodenal iron absorption. This study aims to identify the common genetic variations of the TMPRSS6 gene that affect iron levels among Saudi female patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA).
Methods
All study participants were Saudi females (12–49 years old): 32 patients with IDA, 32 patients with IRIDA, and 34 healthy individuals comprising the control group. Hematological investigations, iron profile, serum hepcidin level, and TMPRSS6 gene transcription were determined. The TMPRSS6 gene was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed among all study participants.
Results
The mean hepcidin and TMPRSS6 RNA transcription levels in IDA and IRIDA groups were significantly lower than those in the control group. TMPRSS6 gene sequence analysis detected 41 variants: two in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), 17 in introns, and 22 in exons. Thirty-three variants were previously reported in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database, and eight variants were novel; one novel variant was in 5′UTR (g.-2 T > G); five novel variants were detected in exons (p.W73X, p.D479N, p.E523K, p.L674L, and p.I799I). At the time of the sequence analysis of our samples, two variants—p.D479N and p.674L—were novel. However, these variants are present at a very low allele frequency in other populations (L674L, 0.00007761 and D479N, 0.000003980).
Conclusion
This is the first study to investigate the genetic variants of TMPRSS6 gene in Saudi female patients with IDA. The generated data will serve as a reference for future studies on IDA in the Arab population.

Abstract: Objective/Background
The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum cardiac troponin I and serum N-terminal (NT) pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels and the utility of tissue Doppler imaging in assessing cardiovascular changes following left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in children with beta-thalassemia major (β-TM). In children with β-TM who depend on regular blood transfusion, cardiac iron toxicity is a common serious complication. The most common cause of death among these patients is congestive heart failure.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study which included 50 patients with β-TM and 50 healthy controls. Tissue Doppler imaging was performed and levels of serum ferritin, cardiac troponin I, and NT pro-BNP were estimated for all included patients.
Results
Serum NT pro-BNP and cardiac troponin (cTnI) showed a significant increase in patients with β-TM (p < .001). In patients with β-TM, LV dimensions (LV end systolic diameter) and (LV end diastolic diameter) were large (p < .01); LV mass (p < .01), E wave, and E/A ratio (p < .01) were high (p < .05); and deceleration time was short (p < .05). Besides, transmitral ratio (E/Em) (p < .05) and tricuspid valve velocity were higher (p < .05), and early diastolic velocity (Em) (p < .05) and systolic wave velocity (Sm) were lower in patients with β-TM (p < .05). A significant positive correlation was detected between the pro-BNP and E wave (r = 0.558, p < .001), E/A ratio (r = 0.403, p < .001), E/Em ratio (r = 0.576, p < .001), and ferritin (r = 0.545, p < .001).
Conclusion
Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging and NT pro-BNP had a significant role in the estimation of ventricular dysfunction in children with β-TM.

Abstract: Sub-ambient radiative cooling has drawn abundant research interest, due to its great energy saving potential. However, the challenge of lacking suitable wind cover material seriously impedes its actual application. To address the challenge, the radiative cooling model with wind cover should be developed firstly. In this work, an accurate radiative cooling model considering the solar and mid-infrared transmissivity of wind cover is developed systematically. Subsequently, the radiative cooling experiments with the polyethylene film wind cover of different thickness are designed to validate the accuracy of the developed model. The experimental results demonstrate that wind cover has a significant impact on radiative cooling performance and the developed model has a high accuracy, with an average relative error of below 3%. Additionally, the developed model is used to investigate the radiative cooling performance in different areas. The modeling results indicate that radiative cooling has a great potential in arid areas. More significantly, feasible breakthrough route towards the rigid wind cover is discussed. The results indicate that the minimum target transmissivity of ultra-white glass and zinc selenide wind covers gradually improve with the increase of humidity. Our work provides a platform to address the challenge of lacking suitable wind cover and promotes the actual application of radiative cooling technology.

Abstract: In the present work, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3)-based solar cell with a back surface field (BSF) layer has been designed and studied. The purpose of this research is to improve the performance of the Sb2Se3-based solar cell by introducing low-cost and widely available barium silicide (BaSi2) material as the BSF layer into the basic Sb2Se3-based heterojunction solar structure. A comparative study on the performance of the conventional Sb2Se3 solar cell structure consisting of Al/FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Mo and the proposed structure of Al/FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/BaSi2/Mo is made. The photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill-factor, power conversion efficiency, and quantum efficiency of heterojunction structures are analyzed intensively by using the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in One Dimension (SCAPS-1D) program. To optimize the device, the thickness of Sb2Se3 absorber layer is varied from 0.1 to 2 μm. In addition, the effects of acceptor ion and bulk defect densities in Sb2Se3 absorber layer, interface defect density of buffer/absorber and absorber/BSF, back surface recombination velocity, operating temperature, and cell resistances on the overall performances are investigated. The thicknesses of BaSi2 BSF and Sb2Se3 absorber layers are optimized to be 0.3 μm and 1 μm, respectively. The efficiency of the proposed solar structure with a thin 1 μm Sb2Se3 absorber layer is obtained to be 29.35%. The simulation results lead to suggest that the BaSi2 material as a BSF layer would be effective to fabricate low cost and high-efficient Sb2Se3-based thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Windows with solar heating capacity can facilitate the indoors–outdoors thermal balance and improve the thermal energy efficiency of buildings, thus reducing the energy consumption in winter; however, their development has been hindered by the narrow light absorption and limited transparency of photothermal materials. In this study, transparent solar thermal surfaces on window glazing are constructed by the in-plane linear assembly of thermoplasmonics under a hierarchical electrostatic field. First results with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) demonstrated that the hierarchical electrostatic field induced the random generation and chain growth of NP oligomers to yield controlled in-plane nanoassemblies. The linear morphology of these nanoassemblies enhanced the local electric field along the NP chains and caused additional plasmon absorption in the near-infrared spectral region, thereby improving the photothermal conversion effect without sacrificing the transparency. The solar thermal surface with Au NP assemblies increased the window glazing temperature by up to 9.8 °C under natural solar irradiation, while maintaining a high visible transmittance (>65%). The temperature increment was within the ballpark of the highest reported values and satisfied the standard requirements for thermal insulation of buildings in cold climates. This work extends new applications of linear nanoassemblies in solar energy harvesting and related energy conversion technologies.

Abstract: Herein, we rationally designed and fabricated the visible-light-driven Cu(OH)2/Cu2O/C3N4 photocatalyst with stable and highly efficient novel all-solid Z-scheme photocatalytic performance. It was observed that selectively fabrication of Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters on the surface of Cu2O as well as the in-situ formation of elemental Cu at the interface of Cu2O/C3N4 effectively enhanced the photoactivity of the Cu(OH)2/Cu2O/C3N4 (622 μmol H2/h/g) compared to pure C3N4 nanosheets (6 μmol H2/h/g), bare Cu2O (21 μmol H2/h/g) and even Cu2O–C3N4 heterostructure (54 μmol H2/h/g) by 103, 30, and 11.5 times, respectively. Based on the BET, DRS, PL, and electrochemical analyses, the superior performance of Cu(OH)2/Cu2O/C3N4 was proved to be mainly attributed to efficient charge carrier separation as well as high surface area of C3N4 nanosheets, noticeable visible-light response of Cu2O and SPR effect of elemental Cu. Additionally, radical species trapping was applied to more deeply study the charge carrier transfer behavior of the samples. This confirmed charge separation of Cu(OH)2/Cu2O/C3N4 followed the Z-scheme mechanism where interlayer elemental Cu as non-precious electron mediator and Cu(OH)2 nanoclusters as electron sink and noble-metal-free cocatalyst synergistically played a key role in accelerating charge carrier transfer and retarding electron-hole recombination. The current study is anticipated to open a new route for the rational design of Cu2O-based Z-scheme photocatalytic systems while taking the advantages of integrative adopting of Cu-based electron mediator and cocatalyst.

Abstract: Anoctamin-1 (ANO1), also known as transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), is identified as a Ca2+-activated Cl− channel that is expressed in many organs and tissues. It is involved in numerous major physiological functions and especially in tumor growth. By screening 530 natural compounds, we identified cepharanthine as a potent blocker of ANO1 channels with an IC50 of 11.2 ± 0.9 μM and Emax of 92.7 ± 1.7%. The Lys384, Arg535, Thr539, and Glu624 in ANO1 are critical for the inhibitory effect of cepharanthine. Similar to its effect on ANO1, cepharanthine inhibits ANO2, the closest analog of TMEM16A. In contrast, up to 30 μM of cepharanthine showed limited inhibitory effects on recombinant ANO6 and bestrophin-1-encoded Ca2+-activated Cl− currents, but it showed no effects on endogenous volume-regulated anion currents (VRAC). Cepharanthine could also potently suppress endogenous ANO1 currents, significantly inhibit cell proliferation and migration, and induce apoptosis in LA795 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, animal experiments have shown that cepharanthine can dramatically inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors in mice. The high specificity provided by cepharanthine could be an important foundation for future studies of the physiological role of ANO1 channels, and these findings may reveal a new mechanism of its anticancer effect.

Abstract: Degradation process of perovskite photovoltaic cells with Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL) has been monitored by means of capacitance spectroscopy. Detailed measurements of the capacitance as a function of the bias voltage revealed that the efficiency decline is accompanied by the doping level decrease of HTL at the perovskite interface. Together with the TOF-SIMS measurement, it is clearly demonstrated that one degradation mechanism is due to the diffusion of dopant in the HTL into the adjacent perovskite layer.

Abstract: Herein, we used a self-assembly method to synthesize novel Cu@h-WO3/WO3·nH2O hierarchical microsphere composites with enhanced photochromism and self-bleaching performance. The composite fabricated with 1.0% Cu-WO displayed a rapid change from light-yellow to dark-gray after 2 min of ultraviolet irradiation and self-bleached in less than 1 h in the dark. Composite samples were characterized to investigate changes in their morphology and structure after being doped with different amounts of Cu. The hierarchical microspheres were composed of small, well-dispersed nanorods that provided active sites capable of absorbing light. Ensuring the proper Cu content in the WO3 lattice promoted the separation of carriers through interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) and prevented the recombination of electron-hole pairs due to excessive doping. Combing hexagonal WO3 with WO3·nH2O and Cu provided unobstructed channels, proton sources, and interactions with W species, which improved the efficiency of proton insertion and extraction. The WO3 hybrid materials described in this research displayed high coloration efficiencies and reversibility and may find applications in solar energy devices.

The heart arrhythmia-linked D130G calmodulin mutation causes premature inhibitory autophosphorylation of CaMKII,

Abstract: The Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is well known for transmitting Ca2+-signals, which leads to a multitude of physiological responses. Its functionality is believed to involve CaMKII holoenzyme dynamics where trans-autophosphorylation of the crucial phosphorylation site, T286 occurs. Phosphorylation of this site does not occur when stimulated exclusively with the arrhythmia associated D130G mutant form of CaM in vitro. Here, we present evidence that the loss-of-CaMKII function correlates with premature phosphorylation of its inhibitory phosphosite T306 in CaMKIIα and T307 in CaMKIIδ as this site was up to 20-fold more phosphorylated in the presence of D130G CaM compared to wildtype CaM. Indeed, changing this phosphosite to a non-phosphorylatable alanine reversed the inhibitory effect of D130G both in vitro and in live cell experiments. In addition, several phosphosites with so far undescribed functions directing the Ca2+-sensitivity of the CaMKII sensor were also affected by the presence of the D130G mutation implicating a role of several additional autophosphosites (besides T286 and T306/T307) so far not known to regulate CaMKII Ca2+ sensitivity. Furthermore, we show that introducing a D130G mutation in the CALM2 gene of the P19CL6 pluripotent mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 decreased the spontaneous beat frequency compared to wildtype cells when differentiated into cardiomyocytes supporting an alteration of cardiomyocyte physiology caused by this point mutation. In conclusion, our observations shed for the first time light on how the D130G CaM mutation interferes with the function of CaMKII and how it affects the beating frequency of cardiomyocyte-like cells.

Abstract: We examine the electrical and thermal characteristics of a photovoltaic module with three-terminal cell interconnection when partially shading a solar cell by experimentally verified modeling. For the interconnection of multi junction and tandem solar cells a two- (2T), three- (3T), and four-terminal (4T) cell architecture is conceivable. The 3T architecture featuring a combination of parallel and series interconnection combines the advantageous of 2T and 4T cells without their drawbacks. We build a photovoltaic (PV) module with silicon solar cells in a 3T tandem solar cell interconnection configuration (3TTSC PV module) to emulate a solar module with 20 3TTSC. To the best of our knowledge, no 3TTSC PV module with more than five solar cells has been shown in previous studies. We measure the effect of partially shading a 3TTSC in this module and develop an electrical simulation to model our experimental results. In the simulations we determine the dissipated power in the top and bottom cells due to the current mismatch caused by partial shading. Our results reveal that the shaded top and bottom cell as well as the adjacent top cell dissipate power when a single 3TTSC is shaded. The two top cells share the dissipated power. Our simulated power dissipation correlates with temperature measurements of the 3TTSC PV module in a steady-state sun simulator. Therefore, in a 3TTSC PV module the temperature of a shaded cell is lower than in a module with 2T configuration. This is an advantage of PV modules with 3T tandem solar cells in terms of reliability and long-term stability.

Abstract: Despite significant efforts in developing tandem ceramic coatings for photo-thermal conversion applications, the underlying physics behind spectrally selective high absorptance and thermal stability of the ceramic absorbers remains to be addressed. In this perspective, TiB2/Ti(B,N)/SiON/SiO2 and Ti/TiB2/Ti(B,N)/SiON/SiO2 films were developed on stainless steel substrates (SS 304) using pulsed direct current and radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The addition of double layer antireflection coating not only increases the solar absorptance, but also the thermal stability of the tandem absorber. The amorphous coatings exhibit a high solar absorptance of 0.981 at room temperature and an acceptable thermal emissivity of 0.15 at 82 °C. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis reveals a gradient in the refractive indices of the individual layers from the substrate to the top surface. The coatings with and without titanium interlayer were found to be stable for 2 h in air up to 450 °C and 400 °C, respectively. Under vacuum, the coatings exhibited good thermal stability up to 250 h at 500 °C. We make an attempt to explain the high absorptance of the tandem absorber in terms of the composition and gradient in refractive indices across the stack.

Abstract: Natural soiling and the subsequent requisite cleaning of photovoltaic (PV) modules result in abrasion damage to the cover glass. The durability of the front glass has important economic consequences, including determining the use of anti-reflective and/or anti-soiling coatings as well as the method and frequency of operational maintenance (cleaning). Artificial linear brush abrasion using Nylon 6/12 bristles was therefore examined to explore the durability of representative PV first-surfaces, i.e., the surface of a module incident to direct solar radiation. Specimens examined include silane surface functionalized-, roughened (etched)-, porous silica-coated-, fluoropolymer-coated-, and ceramic (TiO2 or ZrO2/SiO2/ZrO2/SiO2)-coated-glass, which are compared to monolithic-poly(methyl methacrylate) and -glass coupons. Characterization methods used in this study include: optical microscopy, ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectroscopy, sessile drop goniometry, white-light interferometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The corresponding characteristics examined include: surface morphology, transmittance (i.e., optical performance), surface energy (water contact angle), surface roughness, scratch width and depth, and chemical composition, respectively. The study here was performed to determine coating failure modes; identify characterization methods that can detect nascent failures; compare the durability of popular contemporary coating materials; identify their corresponding damage characteristics; and compare slurry and dry-dust abrasion. This study will also aid in developing an abrasion standard for the PV industry.

Abstract: We report a novel shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) made from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and diatom-based biomass. The diatom materials were prepared by artificial culture and simple acid pickling and sintering. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and polarizing microscopy (POM) were used to characterize the prepared materials, such as their chemical composition, morphology, crystallization performance and so on. The results indicated that no chemical reaction occurred between PEG and diatom-based biomass during the preparation process, but the crystalline regions of PEG were decreased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and thermal cycling tests showed that the SSPCMs with sintered diatom frustules as the supporting material have a good phase change performance and thermal stability in the PEG solid-liquid phase transition region. The maximum latent heat values in the melting and crystallization processes are around 121.54 J/g and 127.20 J/g respectively, and the relative enthalpy efficiency reaches up to ~98.1%. At the same time, the prepared SSPCMs have reliable heat storage and temperature-regulated performance. Our study demonstrates the great potential and significance for the practical application of artificially cultured diatom-based biomass in phase change materials for waste heat recovery and temperature regulation.

Abstract: Solar mirrors for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are expected to ensure a proper efficiency during 30 years. Due to this long time, accelerated aging tests of solar materials are crucial to estimate the real degradation in-service. However, most publications in the CSP field are based on standardized tests which are not sufficient to reach the durability of products in service on all CSP sites and all the market. The impacts on the material properties of unitary stress factors such as temperature, irradiation and humidity have been studied, and models have been proposed for different kinds of materials. All of these models include one or two stress factors, various magnitudes doses, and material dependent parameters. This study aimed to compare degradation under multifactor of stresses: temperature, humidity and irradiation on solar mirrors, with a focus on verification of two following hypotheses:1The coupling hypothesis based on the multiplication of the acceleration factors without synergy between themselves,2.The initialization hypothesis for these three stress factors where the order of application of these tests does not matter. This last hypothesis was never formulated in the models but it is studied in this article. In this paper, we present the results of four different silvered glass mirrors subjected to several accelerated aging tests. The conclusion of this work will help the manufacturer to compare their technology to the others and to ensure the reproducibility of aging between indoor chambers and outdoor sites.

Abstract: To date, there still exist 1.3 billion people worldwide lacking reliable access to electricity. Radiative cooling driving thermoelectric generator can achieve all-day reliable power generation without any energy input. But the existing devices achieve extremely low power generation. In this work, a novel radiative cooling driving thermoelectric generator is developed and it can achieve significantly greater power generation, improving by 24% in inland areas and 71% in coastal areas (compared with the existing modules). Additionally, atmospheric humidity and solar absorption have the adverse impact on power generation, while ambient temperature is the opposite. And wind speed plays a leading role on the power generation of the module. As wind speed increases to 10 m/s, the power generation of the developed module is 5 times that of the existing modules. In the following operation modeling, the developed module achieves a maximum power generation of 0.92 W/m2, 84% higher than that of the existing report. Lastly, the power generation potential of the module is estimated and the Carnot-limited efficiency with radiative cooling can theoretically be improved from 15% to 23.1%. Our developed radiative cooling driving thermoelectric generator significantly improves the all-day power generation performance and has a great application potential in off-grid areas.

Abstract: Various upgrades of the Czochralski (Cz) growth process are currently being investigated in order to increase throughput and reduce production cost of high efficiency silicon-based solar cells. However, as-grown thermal donors (TD) in Cz silicon can significantly reduce the conversion efficiency of such solar cells. An accurate simulation tool is therefore required to investigate and optimize TD formation during crystal growth. A numerical method combining thermo-hydraulic simulations and a kinetic TD formation model was improved by the implementation of a more appropriate TD formation model, identified through a benchmark of the different models available in the literature. Three different Cz growth processes were investigated both numerically and experimentally. Numerical results are in remarkable agreement with TD concentrations measured along the three ingots by the OxyMap technique developed at CEA. The simulations were then used to detect when TD were formed during Cz processes. The reliability of the method was also assessed through sensitivity analyses, highlighting the critical importance of the input interstitial oxygen concentration. These results show that accurate estimates of axial TD concentration profiles can be obtained and so for very different Cz processes, supporting the robustness of the developed method and its relevance to process optimization and furnace design to reduce TD concentrations.

Abstract: Cells in articular cartilage are zonal arranged. Cells in superficial zone cartilage are generally small and proliferative. Appropriate negative pressure stimulation is beneficial to cell survival and tissue repair. Whether negative pressure has promotive impact on the proliferation activity of the superficial zone chondrocytes is of interest. In this study, we isolated superficial chondrocytes from the mandibular condylar cartilage of rats. After negative pressure treatment, the cells were collected for RNA-sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting assays, aiming to detect the proliferative responses of chondrocytes to negative pressure and explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Data from RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that the superficial chondrocytes responded to the 4 h −10 kPa treatment by a significant increase in proliferation. In addition, the expression of high-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) and the phosphorylation of AKT were obviously promoted. Knockdown of HMGB2 decreased AKT phosphorylation and diminished the negative pressure-induced proliferation of chondrocytes, as shown by decreased expression of Ki67 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). In contrast, overexpression of HMGB2 enhanced AKT phosphorylation and further promoted proliferative activity. Moreover, LY294002, an AKT inhibitor, suppressed the proliferative activity of chondrocytes under negative pressure, while SC79, an activator of AKT phosphorylation, enhanced the proliferation of chondrocytes. Our data demonstrated that HMGB2 exhibits a promotion impact on chondrocyte proliferation under negative pressure via the phosphorylation of AKT. These results provide a new perspective for superficial zone chondrocytes proliferation under negative pressure, which should be benefit for cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gain-of-function mutations have been widely reported in patients with tumors and haematological malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms of these pathogenic mutations remain largely uninvestigated. In this study, we have extensively characterized two STAT3 missense mutations, namely a valine-to-alanine exchange in the amino-terminal region (V77A) and a phenylalanine-to-alanine substitution (F174A) in the coiled-coil domain. The two mutants displayed elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, premature nuclear accumulation, and differential transcriptional responses following stimulation of cells with interleukin-6 and interferon-ɣ. In line with their hyper-phosphorylated status, a greater fraction of V77A and F174A proteins was bound to DNA on high-affinity binding sites termed sis-inducible elements (SIE) as compared to the wild-type (WT) protein. Unexpectedly, these STAT3 variants displayed similar kinetics using in vitro kinase and dephosphorylation assays performed with recombinant Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Tc45 phosphatase, respectively. This indicates that the two mutations neither affected the susceptibility of STAT3 to the enzymatic activity of the inactivating tyrosine phosphatase nor to the activating kinase. However, experiments triggering intracellular dephosphorylation by the addition of the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor staurosporine to cytokine-pretreated cells showed that the two mutants partially resisted dephosphorylation. From these data, we propose that the F174A missense mutation hinders the exchange from a parallel to an anti-parallel dimer conformation, thereby increasing the ratio of tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules bound to DNA and enhancing gene-dependent transcription. Our data point to the physiological importance of the anti-parallel dimer conformation in the inactivation of the cytokine-induced STAT3 signalling pathway.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to characterize numerically the performance of a heat pipe flat plate solar collector operating with nanofluids. A mathematical formulation under a 1-dimensional transient heat transfer model was introduced for this purpose. Spatio-temporal temperature variation of each collector subelement was predicted for a typical sunny day in the Moroccan city, Fez. CuO, Al2O3 and TiO2-based nanofluids were compared energetically and exergetically under various operating modes. The nanoparticle loading and mass flow rate of the working fluid were varied in the range of 0–3% and 0.018–0.036 kg/s, respectively. For the flow regime under focus, the decreased specific heat of nanofluids is the main thermal property responsible for the performance enhancement when nanofluids are used. CuO-based nanofluid was found to engender the highest relative enhancements in the energetic and exergetic efficiencies which were estimated at 2.7% and 11.1%, respectively compared to the base fluid (water). Using nanofluids for this collector class can ensure up to 2.95% surplus daily thermal energy generation compared to the base fluid. Moreover, the use of CuO-based nanofluid caused the largest increase in the pressure drop across the collector with a maximum value of 13.26% predicted for 3% nanoparticle loading.

Abstract: Hydrogen-doped indium oxide (IO:H) layers with very high carrier mobility have been developed by two-step fabrication procedure. In the first step IO:H films were deposited by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering from In2O3 target in Ar/water vapour gas mixtures. Different sputtering powers and partial pressures of H2O (pH2O) have been explored and effects induced by changes of these process parameters on final film structure and on electro-optical properties have been investigated. In the second step a post-deposition annealing under vacuum were performed. During this treatment a complete and complex amorphous-crystalline transition occurred. Growth of large crystalline domains give rise to IO:H films with excellent carrier mobility values, up to 138 cm2/Vs. For each sputtering power used, the pH2O range has been identified which allows to obtain the highest carrier mobility value for IOH post-annealed films. Growth of large crystallites occurred in IO:H annealed films and, at this purpose, a selective chemical etching method has been developed to give better evidence for the polycrystalline grains. IO:H films appeared formed by fairly large crystalline domains with presence of sub-grains. Silicon heterojunction cells fabricated by using IO:H layers as front electrode, compared with those obtained from a conventional ITO showed improved short-circuit current density and the resulting conversion efficiency.

Abstract: We demonstrate 2.0–2.2 eV AlGaInP solar cells grown by molecular beam epitaxy and their performance improvement by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). As grown, these cells exhibit lower performance than their counterparts grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE), indicating a high concentration of point defects. RTA improves all aspects of performance, enabling our 2.0 eV cells to match the efficiency of MOVPE-grown cells. RTA also improves the performance of wider-bandgap AlGaInP solar cells, but the magnitude of improvement decreases with %Al/bandgap energy.

Abstract: Prominent inclusion bodies can develop in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when overexpressed antibodies possess intrinsically high condensation propensities. These observations suggest that antibodies deemed to show notable solubility problems may reveal such characteristics preemptively in the form of ER-associated inclusion bodies during antibody overexpression. To define the relationships between solubility problems and inclusion body phenotypes, we investigated the biosynthesis of a model human IgG2λ that shows severe opalescence in an acidic formulation buffer yet retains high solubility at physiological pH. Consistent with the pH-dependent solubility characteristics, the model antibody did not induce notable inclusion body in the physiological pH environment of the ER lumen. However, when individual subunit chains of the antibody were expressed separately, the light chain (LC) spontaneously induced notable crystal-like inclusion bodies in the ER. The LC crystallization event was readily reproducible in vitro by simply concentrating the purified LC protein at physiological pH. Two independent structural determinants for the LC crystallization were identified through rational mutagenesis approach by monitoring the effect of amino acid substitutions on intracellular LC crystallogenesis. The effect of mutations on crystallization was also recapitulated in vitro using purified LC proteins. Importantly, when introduced directly into the model antibody, a mutation that prevents the LC crystallization remediated the antibody's solubility problem without compromising the secretory output or antigen binding. These results illustrate that the ER can serve as a “physiological test tube” that not only reports secretory cargo's high condensation propensity at physiological pH, but also provides an orthogonal method that guides antibody engineering strategy.

Abstract: IDH1 mutations are frequent and early events in gliomas. Mutant IDH1 produces D-2HG that causes epigenetic changes by increasing histone and DNA methylations, thereby contributing to tumor growth. Mutant IDH1 rewires metabolism and endows a few therapeutic vulnerabilities in cells. But, mutant IDH1 inhibitor(s) treatments reverse these therapeutic vulnerabilities by increasing cell growth. Nevertheless, it is unclear how mutant IDH1 inhibitor(s) increases cell growth. As mutant IDH1 inhibitor(s) increase cell growth, therefore we asked whether mutant IDH1 inhibitor(s) activate oncogenes in mutant IDH1-expressing cells. To answer this question, we used allosteric mutant IDH1 inhibitors to treat mutant IDH1-expressing HT1080 cells, and examined for activation of oncogenes by assessing the levels of our read-outs: BCAT1 and YKL-40. We found that mutant IDH1 inhibitors' treatments increased BCAT1 and YKL-40 levels in HT1080 cells. Next, we observed that mutant IDH1 inhibitors activated STAT3 by phosphorylation at Tyr-705 position (pSTAT3-Y705) and its nuclear translocation. Upon examining the molecular mechanism of pSTAT3-Y705 activation in mutant IDH1 inhibitor-treated cells, we found that mutant IDH1 strongly bound STAT3, but mutant IDH1 inhibitor treatment decreased mutant IDH1-STAT3 binding. Furthermore, we observed that STAT3-knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 attenuated the mutant IDH1 inhibitor-mediated increase in BCAT1 and YKL-40 levels, whereas STAT3 overexpression and Interleukin-6 (STAT3 activator) treatments increased BCAT1 and YKL-40 levels. We conclude that mutant IDH1 inhibitors activate the oncogenic transcription factor-STAT3 leading to an increase in BCAT1 and YKL-40 levels in mutant IDH1-expressing cells.

Abstract: Anti-reflective coatings are used in photovoltaic systems to minimize reflectance thus optimizing efficiency. Besides excellent optical properties, these coatings need to provide good mechanical properties due to hostile environmental conditions. Therefore, this study aims at designing anti-reflective coatings based upon multi-layers of TiO2 and SiO2 by magnetron sputtering on glass and silicon substrates at room temperature. Afterwards, these coatings were thermally annealed at 400, 500 and 600 °C to study the influence of such treatment on their optical and mechanical properties. Samples prepared at room temperature and annealed at 400 °C showed an optimized reflectance of about 2%. Advanced materials characterization techniques were used to elucidate the microstructural evolution of the multi-layers. The multi-layers annealed at 400 °C demonstrated a dense and smoothly packed microstructure with homogenous grains (50 nm in size), with a phase transformation from amorphous to anatase. In addition, exposure and damage of the glass substrate were detected for elevated temperatures (500 and 600 °C), thus increasing the reflectance. Nanoindentation revealed an improved hardness, elasticity, and resistance against plastic deformation for the sample annealed at 400 °C. Consequently, anti-reflective coatings with post-annealing treatment at 400 °C, unify two complementary aspects such as improved mechanical properties (extended durability) and enhanced collection abilities over a broader wavelength range (increased efficiency).

Abstract: The concentrated solar energy which is one of the renewable energy sources, is examined in metal melting which requires high temperatures. The study is carried out for the first time in an environment where total solar radiation of 1394 kWh m−2-year and sunshine duration of 2132 h-year at the sea level in Trabzon province at 41° latitudes and 39° longitudes. In the present work, a single concentrator model of solar furnace system is presented. Parabolic dish with a diameter of 1.42 m was used for the first time with high reflection rate chromium nickel foil in the concentration of the solar rays. To store the concentrated solar beams, a metal melting furnace is designed, manufactured and tested. Total heat loss analysis of the furnace according to measured experimental values is performed for the designed solar furnace. The melting process of the aluminum metal was realized in the furnace. In the experiment, the efficiency of the system was calculated based on the measured temperatures and solar radiations. The system efficiency which consists of the parabolic solar concentrator and the solar furnace was found to be approximately 46% at the average focal temperature of 1023 K. In the melting process, the efficiency of the furnace is calculated as the ratio of stored energy to the absorbed solar energy on the surface. The total thermal efficiency 22% is calculated for the first time in the aluminum melting process and mass flow rate is 0,0667 g s−1 at this time.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Lymphoma is a common human cancer that shows a variable geographic incidence worldwide. It is the fourth most common cancer in Jordan. Systemic reports of descriptive epidemiology on lymphoma from the Middle East are limited.
Methods
A nationwide multi-institutional retrospective study was conducted covering all major hospitals and laboratories that provide diagnostic services. We collected data on all cases diagnosed with lymphoma between 2014 and 2019. The included variables were patients’ age, gender, anatomic site, and the histologic type according to the World Health Organization classification system.
Results
A total of 4189 cases were diagnosed with lymphoma. There was a statistically significant gender difference (p < .05), as 57.5% of patients were males. The peak incidence occurred at age 25–55 years. There were 1,652 (39%) cases of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 2,537 (61%) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), where nodular sclerosis (67%) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (53%) were the most common subtypes, respectively. The average age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 population were 8.01 for all lymphomas, 4.33 for NHL, and 3.16 for HL and all remained stable over the 6 years.
Conclusion
HL is the most common lymphoma in Jordan, with a percentage higher than most of reported studies in Asian and Western countries. It also shows a unimodal distribution of age-specific incidence rates, with a single peak in young adults. The incidence rate of HL is higher than Eastern countries but comparable to the West. In contrast, NHL demonstrates a lower incidence rate than Western countries but a similar distribution of subtypes, as mature T/natural killer-cell lymphomas were rare.

Abstract: Objective/Background
To evaluate the efficacy and outcome of adding low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (LDFRT) to induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiation in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC).
Methods
A single-institute, phase II–III, prospectively controlled randomized clinical trial was performed at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre. Patients aged 18–70 years with WHO type II and III, stage III–IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0–2, with adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function were eligible. In total, 108 patients were enrolled in this trial. All patients received two cycles of induction docetaxel and cisplatin (75 mg/m2 each) chemotherapy on Days 1 and 22, followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Radiation therapy consisted of 70 Gy in 33 fractions, with concurrent cisplatin 25 mg/m2 for 4 days on Days 43 and 64. Patients were randomly assigned to either adding LDFRT (0.5 Gy twice daily 6 hours apart for 2 days) to induction chemotherapy in the experimental arm (54 patients) or induction chemotherapy alone in the control arm (54 patients).
Results
There was no significant difference in the post-induction response rates (RRs) or in toxicity between the two treatment arms. The 3-year overall survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) rates for experimental arm and control arm were 94% versus 93% (p = .8), 84.8% versus 87.5% (p = .58), and 84.1% versus 91.6% (p = .25), respectively.
Conclusion
The results showed no benefit from adding LDFRT to induction chemotherapy in terms of RR, OS, LRC, and DMFS.

Abstract: In this work, polythiothene (PT) films on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate (PT-5/ITO, PT-10/ITO, PT-15/ITO, and PT-20/ITO) are prepared by pulsed electrodeposition, where + 1.5 V as the first square waveform pulse is applied to the cell for 5, 10, 15, and 20 s, respectively. These obtained electrodes are further assembled into the electrochromic devices (ECDs). We investigate the surface morphology, electrochemical properties of PT films, and EC performance of corresponding ECDs. The results indicate that PT films possess loose surface morphology, large surface area and high electrochemical activities. Among four kinds of films (PT-5, PT-10, PT-15 and PT-20), PT-10 film has the most uniform distribution of nanoparticles and smaller particle size. The EC properties of ECDs are significantly improved, which exhibits a large optical contrast, high coloration efficiency, short switching time, and stable cycling. The ECD based on PT-10/ITO (ECD-10) has the best EC performance, caused by the nanostructured morphology of PT-10 film that is most conducive to electron conduction, ion diffusion and migration. Compared with the ECD based on PT film obtained by potentiostatic deposition on ITO glass, the optical contrast of ECD-10 increases by 94% (17 → 33%), and its coloration efficiency increases by 88% (159 → 299 cm2/C). Among all ECDs, the response time of ECD-10 is the shortest, and its coloration and bleaching time are 1.12 and 0.80 s, respectively. This study suggests that pulsed electrodeposition might be a facile strategy for fabricating high-performance polymer-based ECDs.

Abstract: Fabricating flexible vanadium dioxide (VO2) films is a serious challenge towards commercial applications. In this work, we proposed a new strategy to directly deposit VO2 thermochromic films on flexible substrates by using Cr2O3 structural template layer, which can serve as growth template for low temperature (~300 °C) deposition of VO2 films. The obtained crystalline VO2 films on flexible substrates show significant phase transition properties with narrow hysteresis loops. Optical and electrical characterizations have indicated phase transition features of the flexible VO2 films, with an excellent solar modulation ability (~60% at 2500 nm) and a resistivity change over 2 orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the flexible VO2 film exhibits narrow hysteresis loops during the phase transition process, and the hysteresis loop widths are less than 1 °C. Flexibility and stability of VO2 film in this work has been demonstrated by a designed bending test, which can maintain stable thermochromic performance after over 5000 bending cycles. This work provided a facile strategy to fabricate VO2 films on flexible substrates as flexible electronic devices.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) often present with a severe reduction in platelet counts and suffer from an increased risk of bleeding. However, platelet counts do not accurately predict bleeding risk in these patients.
Methods
We thereby conducted a case series prospective study to compare the ability to predict hemorrhage in ITP patients between platelet counts and various rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters.
Results
The inclusion criteria for patients diagnosed with acute, persistent, and chronic ITP were platelet counts of <30 × 109/L and no clinically significant bleeding (grade ≥ 2 according to the WHO Bleeding Scale) at the beginning of the study. After 24 hours of follow-up, of the 45 enrolled patients, 14 (31.1%) experienced clinically significant bleeding. The mean platelet counts of patients with and without clinically significant bleeding were not statistically different (p = .09). However, the mean EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), EXTEM A10, EXTEM area under the curve (AUC), and platelet maximum clot elasticity (MCE) values of the two groups were statistically different (p < .05). There was also a significant difference in IPF values between these two groups (p < .05.)
Conclusion
Results obtained from this preliminary study demonstrate that ROTEM parameters might be useful in predicting factors for hemorrhage in ITP patients. Future studies with a larger sample size is warranted to confirm our findings, which will allow prompt and effective bleeding management in ITP patients.

Abstract: We show that the data of external quantum efficiency (EQE) reported in the paper in title are measured at illuminated metal front contacts and the data of external reflectance (R) reported in the same paper are measured at not illuminated metal front contacts. Such inconsistency prevents the simulation programs Quokka 2 and PC1D from fitting the reported EQE-data by using the R-data reported in the paper in title. The reported EQE-data can be fitted by using an effective reflectance including the reflectance of metal front contacts. The need of determining curves of effective reflectance can be avoided by providing EQE- and R-curves that are consistent with each other.

Abstract: A critical unknown in the field of skeletal metastases is how cancer cells find a way to thrive under harsh conditions, as exemplified by metastatic colonization of adipocyte-rich bone marrow by prostate carcinoma cells. To begin understanding molecular processes that enable tumor cells to survive and progress in difficult microenvironments such as bone, we performed unbiased examination of the transcriptome of two different prostate cancer cell lines in the absence or presence of bone marrow adipocytes. Our RNAseq analyses and subsequent quantitative PCR and protein-based assays reveal that upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) genes is a shared signature between metastatic prostate carcinoma cell lines of different origin. Pathway analyses and pharmacological examinations highlight the ER chaperone BIP as an upstream coordinator of this transcriptomic signature. Additional patient-based data support our overall conclusion that ER stress and UPR induction are shared, important factors in the response and adaptation of metastatic tumor cells to their micro-environment. Our studies pave the way for additional mechanistic investigations and offer new clues towards effective therapeutic interventions in metastatic disease.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignant cancer, frequently due to its late diagnosis and high recurrence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) from different malignancies including ovarian cancer have been linked to chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms mediating therapy resistance is urgent to finding novel targets for therapy-resistant tumors. Aberrant O-glycosylation ascribed to subtle alteration of GALNT family members during malignant transformation facilitate metastasis in various cancers. The current study demonstrated that BAG3 was upregulated in platin-resistant ovarian cancer tissues and cells, and high BAG3 predicted dismal disease-free survival of patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, the current study showed that BAG3 facilitated CSC-like properties of ovarian cancer cells via regulation of GALTN10. In a term of mechanism, BAG3 epigenetically regulated GALNT10 transactivation via histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) presenter WDR5. We demonstrated that WDR5 increased H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modification at the promoter regions of GALNT10, facilitating recruitment of transcription factor ZBTB2 to the GALNT10 promoter. Collectively, our study uncovers an epigenetic upregulation of GALNT10 by BAG3 via WDR5 to facilitate CSCs of platin-resistant ovarian cancers, providing additional information for further identification of attractive targets with therapeutic significance in platin-resistant ovarian cancer.

Abstract: For concentrator photovoltaic modules, a promising approach is the miniaturization of the solar cell and optics. In solar cells, the perimeter is a source for the recombination of minority charge carriers, which leads to a voltage loss. With decreasing cell size, the ratio between perimeter and solar cell area increases and therefore the perimeter recombination becomes more relevant. In this work, we quantify this loss using the open-circuit voltages derived from I–V measurements of triple-junction concentrator solar cells of different sizes under varying irradiances. For the simulations, a one-dimensional diode model with two parallel interconnected diodes is applied with ideality factors of n1 = 3 and n2 = 6 for the triple-junction solar cell. As we compare solar cell designs that differ in size and fraction of the metallized area, we must take into account that the parallel resistance and the dark saturation currents differ. In the model, this discrepancy is conveyed by a dependency on the perimeter-to-area ratio and incorporating the ratio between the active and total areas into the model. Therefore, the areas need to be determined. For small solar cells, the uncertainty of the measurement is high. We account for this uncertainty by investigating areas derived from the photolithography masks and measurements. The model is applied to investigate the influence of the voltage loss on solar cells smaller than 3 mm in diameter. We show that, despite the simplification of the ideality factors, the model agrees well with the measurements. It is shown that for high concentrations (C > 500), the voltage loss is below 2% even for small cells with P/A up to 120 cm−1. We show that the dark area voltage loss for this cell and concentration is of the same order of magnitude as the loss due to the perimeter.

Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders associated with the deficiency of lysosomal enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation. The resulting cellular accumulation of GAGs is responsible for widespread tissue and organ dysfunctions. The MPS III, caused by mutations in the genes responsible for the degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), includes four subtypes (A, B, C, and D) that present significant neurological manifestations such as progressive cognitive decline and behavioral disorders. The established treatments for the MPS III do not cure the disease but only ameliorate non-neurological clinical symptoms. We previously demonstrated that the natural variant of the hepatocyte growth factor NK1 reduces the lysosomal pathology and reactivates impaired growth factor signaling in fibroblasts from MPS IIIB patients. Here, we show that the recombinant NK1 is effective in rescuing the morphological and functional dysfunctions of lysosomes in a neuronal cellular model of the MPS IIIB. More importantly, NK1 treatment is able to stimulate neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma SK-NBE cells stable silenced for the NAGLU gene causative of the MPS IIIB. These results provide the basis for the development of a novel approach to possibly correct the neurological phenotypes of the MPS IIIB as well as of other MPSs characterized by the accumulation of HS and progressive neurodegeneration.

Abstract: The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease are plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Yet, Alzheimer's is a complex disease with many contributing factors, such as energy-metabolic changes, which have been documented in autopsy brains from individuals with Alzheimer's and animal disease models alike. One conceivable explanation is that the interplay of age-related extracellular and intracellular alterations pertaining to Alzheimer's, such as cerebrovascular changes, protein aggregates and inflammation, evoke a mitochondrial response. However, it is not clear if and how mitochondria can contribute to Alzheimer's pathophysiology. This study focuses on one particular aspect of this question by investigating the functional interaction between the microtubule-associated protein tau and the mitochondrial inner membrane fusion machinery, which shows alterations in Alzheimer's brains. OPA1 is an essential inner membrane-fusion protein regulated by the two membrane proteases OMA1 and YME1L1. Assessment of OPA1 proteolysis—usually found in dividing mitochondria—and posttranslational tau modifications in mouse and human neuroblastoma cells under different experimental conditions clarified the relationship between these two pathways: OPA1 hydrolysis and phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of tau may coincide, but are not causally related. OPA1 cleavage did not alter tau's phosphorylation pattern. Conversely, tau's phosphorylation state did not induce nor correlate with OPA1 proteolysis. These results irrefutably demonstrate that there is no direct functional interaction between posttranslational tau modifications and the regulation of the OMA1-OPA1 pathway, which implies a common root cause modulating both pathways in Alzheimer's.

Abstract: Hybridised photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems, obtained by merging photo-voltaic (PV) and photo-thermal (PT) technologies, can lead to enhanced conversion efficiencies. Liquid spectral beam splitters (SBSs) offer control of the ‘thermal’ and ‘electrical’ components of the solar spectrum. Combining PVT systems with liquid SBSs facilitates enhanced control of the thermal and electrical outputs, further improving the PVT systems efficiency and making them economically viable. Traditionally, liquid SBSs contain nanostructures suspended in a base-fluid to capitalise on the enhanced heat transfer capabilities offered by the nanostructures' surface morphology. These nanofluids have certain disadvantages, such as stability problems, environmental hazards and synthetic cost concerns, which preclude them from becoming a viable substitute for commercial (single-phase) fluids. This study offers an alternative strategy by employing a set of newly developed fluids containing organic and organometallic imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline derivatives for SBS-PVT systems. These new working fluids were designed to mimic the behaviour of luminescent down-shifting (LDS) molecules while offering enhanced thermophysical characteristics over the host base-fluid. Their optical, fluorescent and thermophysical properties enabled an increased heating rate within the working fluid. Their integration as working fluids in an SBS-PVT system lead to optical efficiencies of ~63% i.e. an 18%–20% improvement over the standalone PV technology. The fluid properties displayed a 61% increase in the economic value of the energy captured when compared to the host base-fluid alone for the same PVT system. Consequently, these novel fluids and the organic molecules they contain can be effectively designed as high performance spectrally selective fluids for PVT applications.

Abstract: Efficacy of conventional chemoimmunotherapy is limited in patients with Richter syndrome (RS) with anticipated median overall survival (OS) of less than 10 months. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is commonly offered as a consolidative treatment option in RS. To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled studies that have compared allo-HCT against other therapies in RS; available allo-HCT data are limited to small case series from single-institution or registry studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the totality of evidence regarding the efficacy (or lack thereof) of allo-HCT for RS. We extracted data on post-allograft outcomes related to benefits (overall response rate [ORR], complete remission [CR], OS, and progression-free survival [PFS]). For harms, data were extracted on non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse post-allografting. Our search strategy identified 240 studies, but only four studies (n = 72 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Pooled ORR, CR, OS, and PFS rates were 79%, 33%, 49%, and 30%, respectively. Pooled NRM and relapse rates were 24% and 28%, respectively. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that allo-HCT yields encouraging OS in RS, thus remaining a reasonable treatment option in fit patients whose disease demonstrates a chemosensitive response to pre-transplant salvage therapies. Novel strategies are certainly needed to reduce the risk of relapse to further improve outcomes in these patients.

Abstract: As part of the evaluation for chemotherapy readiness, urine specific gravity is measured to assess the patient’s overall hydration status. Depending on the accuracy of the methods used, patients may be adversely affected by having their chemotherapy delayed or prematurely started. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new automated urine dipstick readout device (Clinitek), we tested 196 consecutive urine samples for urine specific gravity and compared them with the practical gold standard, a urine refractometer. We found a high correlation between both tools among clean urine samples, but a poor correlation among the pathological urine samples.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have now achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 25%, but their long-term stability under illumination and thermal stress is still a major barrier to commercialisation. Herein, we demonstrate the evaluation of light-induced degradation activation energy (Ea) of encapsulated semi-transparent PSCs by using the commonly employed method in crystalline silicon solar cells. Different parameters showed different activation energies where primary degradation is due to increase in series resistance, which also led to reduction in short-circuit current. Open-circuit voltage and shunt resistance also change with different Ea, suggesting the mechanism of the reduction is likely to be due to different reasons. Despite each parameter exhibiting slight variation over time for each temperature, the overall trend converges, indicating that each parameter is likely to be primarily reduced by a single dominant reaction. We also report the main cause of irreversible device degradation is not due to the decomposition of the perovskite layer as confirmed by X-ray diffraction characterisation. Instead, our pole figure map and absorption spectra analysis indicate that a loss of crystal symmetry occurs due to ion migration within the device that induce oxidation of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). Our work provides a better understanding through quantification of the degradation processes of encapsulated semi-transparent PSCs over time, which is essential for further progress and development of stable perovskite-Si tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Chalcogenides, such as CdTe, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, have made significant progress in their thin-film photovoltaic performance, but the toxicity (CdTe) and scarcity (Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2) of the constituent elements, as well as the inevitable anti-site disorder (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4), limit the further improvement of efficiency. In this work, a new thin-film absorber, Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4, is studied in terms of both film growth and characterization. We prepare the precursor film by the sol-gel method followed by selenization at high temperature. The absorbance of the precursor film is higher than 98% at wavelengths of 200–1300 nm. The crystallinity and the phase transformation of the prepared film can be tailored greatly by modifying the selenization process. When the selenization temperature is 570 °C and the selenization time is 30 min, a highly-crystalline, stannite-structured Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4 film is obtained. A solar cell fabricated with such Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4 film as the absorber layer achieves efficiency of 1.79%, which is the highest efficiency reported to date for this material. This study demonstrates that Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4 is a promising photovoltaic material and has huge potential for the fabrication of low-cost solar cell.

Abstract: Photoelectrodes capable of cost-effective hydrogen production on a large scale, via photoelectrochemical water splitting under solar light, could offer an elegant solution to many current problems of humankind caused by over-reliance on fossil fuels and the resulting environmental pollution. The search and design of low-cost photoelectrode materials and substrates for practical applications are required. In this work, unmodified hematite photoanodes grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MO-CVD) onto CuO–Sb2O5–SnO2 ceramic substrates are reported. The deposition time of hematite precursor varied between 10 min, 60 min, and 90 min. The photoanode grown for 60 min exhibits the highest photocurrent density recorded at 1.23 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode): 4.79 mA/cm2 under blue light of Thorlabs LED M455L2 (455 nm), 0.41 mA/cm2 under the radiation of the real sun in Mexico, and 0.38 mA/cm2 under AM1.5G solar simulator conditions. The high porosity of CuO–Sb2O5–SnO2 ceramics permits the permeation of the hematite precursor into the substrate bulk, which results in 3D-growth of a thin Fe2O3-coating (50 nm or less) on conductive SnO2-grains in the ceramics to a depth of ca. 5 μm. The thick photocatalytic layer (SnO2-grains coated by hematite) of several micrometers assures a good light harvesting by the photoelectrode, while the nano-sized Fe2O3-films on conductive SnO2-grains is favorable for charge diffusion. This architecture of the photoelectrode results in good photoelectrochemical characteristics and is promising for further development.

Abstract: Background
Disparities driven by socioeconomic factors have been shown to impact outcomes for cancer patients. We sought to explore this relationship among patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who were not considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplant in the first-line setting and how it varied over time.
Methods
We queried the National Cancer Database for patients diagnosed with MM between 2004 and 2016 and included only those who received systemic therapy as the first-line treatment. Enrollment rates for therapy were calculated as receipt of systemic therapy as the incident event of interest (numerator) over time to initiation of therapy (denominator) and used to calculate incident rate ratios that were further analyzed using Poisson regression analysis. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for survival analysis, and differences were reported as hazard ratios (HRs).
Results
We identified 56,102 patients for enrollment analysis and 50,543 patients for survival analysis. Therapy enrollment in a multivariate model was significantly impacted by race and sex (p < .005). Advanced age, earlier year of diagnosis, lack of insurance or Medicaid, and higher comorbidity were associated with poor survival (HR > 1), whereas female sex, non-Hispanic black race, higher income, and treatment at an academic center were associated with improved survival (HR < 1).
Conclusion
Disparities in treatment of MM exist and are caused by a complex interplay of multiple factors, with socioeconomic factor playing a significant role. Studies exploring such determinants may help in equitable distribution of resources to overcome such differences.

Abstract: Autophagy is a highly conservative self-digestion process to maintain intracellular homeostasis and to ensure the survival of cells under stress. Activation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling depends on the normal endocytic degradation of pathway receptor Patched1 (Ptch1). It is unclear whether autophagy participates in the receptor endocytosis and modulates Shh signaling transduction. Here we found that blocking macroautophagy attenuates Shh signaling due to the failed transport of Smoothened (Smo) into primary cilia. At the upstream of Smo, Ptch1 was poly-ubiquitinated through K63-conjugated ubiquitin chains. Macroautophagy participates Shh-induced degradation of poly-ubiquitinated Ptch1, contributing to the activation of Shh signaling.

Abstract: Heterochromatin, a type of condensed DNA in eukaryotic cells, has two main categories: Constitutive heterochromatin, which contains H3K9 methylation, and facultative heterochromatin, which contains H3K27 methylation. Methylated H3K9 and H3K27 serve as docking sites for chromodomain-containing proteins that compact chromatin. M33 (also known as CBX2) is a chromodomain-containing protein that binds H3K27me3 and compacts chromatin in vitro. However, whether M33 mediates chromatin compaction in cellulo remains unknown. Here we show that M33 compacts chromatin into DAPI-intense heterochromatin domains in cells. The formation of these heterochromatin domains requires H3K27me3, which recruits M33 to form nuclear bodies. G9a and SUV39H1 are sequentially recruited into M33 nuclear bodies to create H3K9 methylated chromatin in a process that is independent of HP1α. Finally, M33 decreases progerin-induced nuclear envelope disruption caused by loss of heterochromatin. Our findings demonstrate that M33 mediates the formation of condensed chromatin by forming nuclear bodies containing both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. Our model of M33-dependent chromatin condensation suggests H3K27 methylation corroborates with H3K9 methylation during the formation of facultative heterochromatin and provides the theoretical basis for developing novel therapies to treat heterochromatin-related diseases.

Abstract: We have fabricated luminescent (Er,Ho)2O3 thin films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and studied their capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art single-junction c-Si bifacial solar cells. The films convert IR photons (e.g. 1523 nm) by three- and two-photon upconversion process to emit visible-light in the 400–700 nm range. When the films were coupled with solar cells, ~3% improvement in the short-circuit current density (620 ± 5 to 638 ± 5 mAcm−2) was recorded under a simulated solar excitation equivalent to 16 suns. These findings highlight a potential of ALD for the design and fabrication of luminescent coatings for practical solar cell devices.

Abstract: The paraffin incorporation in device of glass envelope allows the thermal regulation, increasing the thermal comfort and energy efficiency of buildings. Addition of nanoparticles has an advanced application prospect in the field of solar energy collection and storage capacity of glass envelope systems filled with paraffin. The present study conducts an experimental and numerical investigation in order to study photothermal properties of the paraffin incorporated ZnO or CuO nanoparticles. An experimental and theoretical model is also established to analyze the effect of nanoparticles on the thermophysical and optical properties of nano-enhanced paraffin. The results show that due to the presence of the nanoparticles, the transmittance of nano-enhanced paraffin decreases. On the other hand, temperature increment results in a small rise in the transmittance of nano-enhanced paraffin. The results also indicate that the utilized nanoparticles exhibit a higher attenuation to light, and the scattering effect cannot be avoided, where the maximum scattering proportion is 6.3%. Improvements of 5.87 and 13.12% in thermal conductivity of nano-enhanced paraffin at the volume fraction of 5 × 10−4 vol% are obtained using ZnO and CuO nanoparticles, respectively. The evaluation of the photothermal performance based on the temperature variations shows that the CuO/paraffin can absorb more solar energy. The optimum photothermal performance can be satisfied by the nanoparticle volume fraction ranging from 5 × 10−4 to 1.5 × 10−3 vol%.

Abstract: In order to analyze why the CIGS (CuInGaSe2) - based solar cells efficiency decrease for wide band gap (high Ga content), we have performed a series of samples by PVD using the three stage process. The average compositions of our solar cells range from x = 0 to x = 0.88, as measured by X-ray diffraction. An important feature of this process is to create a double Ga gradient into the absorber, which contributes to improve efficiencies, and this has a major impact on the determination of the sample composition from x-ray diffraction data. We have developed a model in order to assess this impact and question the validity of the compositions extracted from x-ray data. This model allows to get some information about gradient shapes. Using our model, we have obtained some insights on the evolution of the gallium gradient in samples with increasing Ga content, and we determine that this gradient is less pronounced when increasing the amount of gallium. It is a well known fact that this gradient assists the extraction of photocreated carriers, and the modifications of the gallium profile that we have determined may explain, for some part, the degradation of solar cells efficiency for high gallium compositions.

Abstract: Reversible thermal dehydration reaction of MgCl2·6H2O has been studied as a potential working way for thermochemical heat storage with high energy density. Understanding its complex multistep dehydration behavior is significant for guiding practical applications; however, there is a lack of deep understanding about the phase transition of MgCl2·6H2O during its dehydration reaction process. In this work, the reaction mechanism, dehydration kinetics, and equilibrium behaviors of MgCl2·6H2O are studied in detail with the help of thermal analytical measurements and morphological observations. The thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) shows the dehydration behavior and reaction pathways varying with gas atmosphere, heating rate, water vapor pressure, and sample mass. The formation of intermediate molten MgCl2·6H2O is identified that it makes strong effects on the dehydration kinetics and reaction equilibrium. Futhermore, a revised Clapeyron equilibrium equation is developed and experimentally verified for describing the reaction equilibrium of molten MgCl2·6H2O. It is expected that the findings in this study pave paths for efficient thermal energy storage application based on MgCl2·6H2O.

Abstract: Background
Most data on autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) in myeloma are based on the use of innovator formulation of melphalan. Comparative bioequivalence and efficacy studies of generic melphalan are lacking.
Methods
In this retrospective study, we report long-term outcomes of auto-HCT in myeloma using innovator (Alkeran, Aspen Pharma; n = 41) and generic melphalan (Alkacel, Celon Labs, India; n = 55) formulations. All consecutive patients at a single center from the period 2011–2018 were included.
Results
The median follow-up in the innovator and generic groups was 61.7 and 32.5 months, respectively. Both groups were matched for age, sex, stage, and myeloma response. There were significantly more patients in the innovator melphalan group who were administered melphalan at a reduced dose at physician discretion (26.8% vs. 3.6%, p = .001). There were significantly more patients with grade 3 or higher mucositis (68.3% vs. 38.1%, p < .0001) and grade 3 or higher diarrhea (85.4% vs. 50.1%, p < .0001) in the innovator group. The median duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in the innovator group (19 days vs. 15.5 days, p < .0001). There were significantly more patients in the generic group who received standard maintenance (94.5% vs. 34.1%, p < .0001). Despite the differences in the melphalan dose and post-transplant strategies, the 4-year progression-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different in the two groups (58% vs. 63%, p = .7, 71% vs. 72%, p = .4, respectively).
Conclusion
Long-term efficacy comparison is helpful in the absence of postmarketing bioequivalence studies of generic melphalan.

Abstract: Abnormal intraglandular stromal-epithelial interactions have been known as a main key contributing factor for development of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). However, the underlying mechanism for the dysregulated intercellular communication remains unclear. In this study we compared the proteomic profiles of hyperplastic tissue with adjacent normal tissue of BPH and identified Rab27B small GTPase, a key regulator of exocytosis, as a protein that was overexpressed in the epithelium of BPH tissue. Overexpression of Rab27B in prostatic epithelial cells strongly increased the signaling activities of the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, whereas, downregulation of Rab27B expression in the epithelial cells of BPH reduced the signaling activities and decreased cell proliferation. The elevated Rab27B expression caused an overall increase in cell surface presentation of growth factor receptors without affecting their expression. However, the small GTPase also possesses an inhibitory activity against mTORC1 independent of its role in cell surface presentation of growth factor receptors. Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role of the small GTPase in autocrine and paracrine signaling and suggest that its abnormal expression underlies the dysregulated stromal-epithelial interactions in BPH.

Abstract: Self-designed selenium thermal-cracking system is used to produce selenium vapor with high activity for sufficient selenization of CZTSSe absorber. CZTS precursor film prepared by magnetron sputtering of CZTS quaternary target. By adjusting the heating temperature of selenium source to 600 °C, macromolecular Sen can be cracked to small molecule Sen with high reaction activity, which is helpful to form densely packed large grains in the CZTSSe absorber due to the reduction of selenium vacancies and the enhancement of surface migration. The crystallization quality of CZTSSe absorber is further improved by the optimization of selenium source heating rate. A peak performance of solar cells achieved exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 7.9%, with Voc of 410 mV, Jsc of 35.25 mA/cm2 and FF of 54.98%. J-V characterization, electrochemical impedance spectra and capacitance-voltage tests are also employed to analysis the device performance enhancement mechanism.

Abstract: This study provides a general process for the synthesis of carbon paper (CP) supported core-shell MnCo2O4@NiCo2O4 nanoarrays structure through two-step solvothermal method. The as-synthesized hierarchical MnCo2O4@NiCo2O4/CP is further used as counter electrode (CE) based on Titanium mesh of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and exhibits an excellent electrochemical property with a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.58%. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the contribution from carbon paper combination outer-sphere NiCo2O4 nanosheet and inner-sphere MnCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays and the use of titanium mesh, which offer a large specific surface area, abundant electronic transmission channels and small internal impedance. The present work can be helpful to develop low-cost and effective CE materials in DSSCs and other applications.

Abstract: Waste materials have a great potential as sustainable and cheap sensible thermal energy storage material (STESM). There are a number of previous studies on the use of wastes as STESM such as Cofalit, coal fly ash and electric arc furnace slags, by-products of the ilmenite mining industry and by-products of the potash production, municipal waste glass and by-products generated in steel industry. The aim of this study is to assess demolition wastes (DW) from urban regenerations in Turkey as a STESM and compare relevant properties with other waste and by-product storage materials. Results show that DW developed here has better or similar storage performance compared to other STESM from wastes. DW is found to be durable up to 750 °C and can be used for high temperature thermal energy storage applications in packed beds.

Abstract: In order to realise the potential of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) to provide cheap, scalable access to renewable energy, it is necessary to improve their lifetime and cost of encapsulation. The aim of this work is to achieve these aims by blending the donor and acceptor with the commodity polymer, PMMA, to form a ternary blend device with enhanced lifetime. We find that ternary OPV devices prepared in this manner can have up to double the lifetime of the binary control devices to an extent that depends upon the PMMA morphology and the processing additives used. Further, we find that the initial performance of ternary OPVs may decrease (in the case of PTB7-based blends) or slightly increase (in the case of P3HT-based blends) when compared to their binary counterparts, which is hypothesised to be due to donor compatibility with the PMMA. These findings suggest that this approach can be employed in other OPV blend systems and give design rules to maximise the positive impact on device lifetime.

Abstract: Heptyl viologen (HV) based electrochromic devices (ECD) suffer from poor write-erase efficiencies and become permanently colored after a few redox switches, thus limiting their use as electrochromic windows or mirrors. This formidable issue is addressed by incorporating an ionic additive: a disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), in the ionogel electrolyte. EDTA, via electrostatic interactions, binds to the HV+• radical cation and prevents its' further reduction to the undesirable pale colored neutral HV0, by wedging in-between the moieties and inhibiting their undesirable stacking. A large area HV/EDTA in gel/Prussian blue (PB) ECDs of ~8 cm × 6 cm dimensions outperforms the HV/gel/PB ECD which is evidenced in the enhanced transmission modulation (ΔTmax: 73.1% at 606 nm), coloration efficiency (η: 346.2 cm2 C−1) and superior chromaticity coordinates (colored: L*,a,b: 40, 10, −65) compared to lower magnitudes of 69.2%, 270.3 cm2 C−1 and (L*,a,b: 50.3, 8, −48.5) respectively. When evaluated as a mirror, HV/EDTA in gel/PB ECD shows a reflectance modulation of ~65% which does not alter significantly, even at −10 °C or at +60 °C, ratifying its thermal robustness. The HV/EDTA in gel/PB ECD shows color and bleach times of 16 and 35 s, retains ~93% of its’ initial contrast after 104 cycles and after aging for 2 years, continues to deliver a transmission modulation of 68%. This study successfully demonstrates a cost effective, easily implementable, scaled-up HV/EDTA in gel/PB based long-lived durable ECD for energy efficient smart window and rearview mirror applications.

Abstract: Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin and part of the 15 member galectin family that are evolutionarily highly conserved. It is the only chimeric protein with a C‐terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) linked to a proline, glycine, and tyrosine rich additional N‐terminal domain. Galectin-3 binds several cell surface glycoproteins via its CRD domain as well as undergoing oligomerization, via binding at the N-terminal or the CRD, resulting in the formation of a galectin‐3 lattice on the cell surface. The galectin-3 lattice has been regarded as being a crucial mechanism whereby extracellular galectin-3 modulates cellular signalling by prolonging retention time or retarding lateral movement of cell surface receptors in the plasma membrane. As such galectin-3 can regulate various cellular functions such as diffusion, compartmentalization and endocytosis of plasma membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids and the functionality of membrane receptors. In multiple models of organ fibrosis, it has been demonstrated that galectin-3 is potently pro-fibrotic and modulates the activity of fibroblasts and macrophages in chronically inflamed organs. Increased galectin-3 expression also activates myofibroblasts resulting in scar formation and may therefore impact common fibrotic pathways leading to fibrosis in multiple organs. Over the last decade there has been a marked increase in the scientific literature investigating galectin-3 in a range of fibrotic diseases as well as the clinical development of new galectin-3 inhibitors. In this review we will examine the role of galectin‐3 in fibrosis, the therapeutic strategies for inhibiting galectin-3 in fibrotic disease and the clinical landscape to date.

Abstract: The interest in cast mono silicon is increasing due to its lower energy consumption and resulting smaller carbon footprint, lower oxygen content and resulting less oxygen-related defects as well as easy scalability to large wafer formats like 210 × 210 mm2 full square. As a cast silicon alternative to high performance multicrystalline (hpm) silicon, which rapidly lost market share, we analyze the cell efficiency potential of cast mono silicon in a TOPCon cell structure. We show how the absence of grain boundaries and the exceptional tolerance of the material quality towards high temperature processing enable this significant increase of the cell efficiency potential compared to hpm silicon. The very effective suppression of crystal defects by the Seed Manipulation for ARtificially controlled defect Technique (SMART) results in a very low lateral variation of the high material quality. We present certified cell efficiencies of 23.3% on n-type material crystallized in our labs, which demonstrates the high efficiency potential even for our lab-type G2 crystallization. An additional crystallization experiment for 210 × 210 mm2 wafers demonstrates that SMART mono is compatible to large wafer sizes. A significant difference of the crystallization costs for Cz and cast mono crystallization as a function of electricity costs is discussed.

Abstract: Isoginkgetin (IGG) is a small molecule inhibitor of pre-mRNA splicing. Failure to accurately remove introns could lead to the production of aberrant mRNAs and proteins. The cellular responses to splicing stress are not well defined. Here, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to assess genome wide changes in gene expression associated with exposure to IGG. Two of the 3 enriched pathways identified using PANTHER analysis of differentially expressed transcripts are linked to the ATF4 transcription factor. We confirmed that ATF4 was selectively translated and upregulated in response IGG despite an almost complete block to total protein synthesis. Importantly, partial disruption of the ATF4 gene using CRISPR-mediated gene editing prevented IGG-induced changes in gene expression. Remarkably, another spliceosome inhibitor, pladienolide B, did not inhibit translation, activate ATF4 or increase ATF4-dependent gene expression. Taken together, IGG activates ATF4 and an ATF4-dependent transcriptional response but these effects are not common to all spliceosome inhibitors.

Abstract: The most concern of using nitrate salt mixtures in a concentrated solar power plant is their corrosion to the working pipes and containers. This paper studied the corrosion behavior of stainless steel 316 in a ternary nitrate salt mixture at three different conditions using static corrosion method. The mass losses of each sample were carefully measured. The instantaneous and average corrosion rates were predicted. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies with the corrosion products of the 316SS coupons after the test were investigated using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) combined with EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and XRD (X-ray Diffraction) analyses. The results showed that temperature is the main factor to affect the average corrosion rate, for example, 0.0032 mm/a at 300 °C and 0.016 mm/a at 500 °C during the test period. At 300 °C, adding 10 wt% EG can reduce the average corrosion rate by 20%. The cross-sectional morphologies revealed that the corrosion layer of 316SS coupon in the composite with 10 wt% EG was 1/3 thinner than that in pure salt mixture at 300 °C. That was because the CaCO3 phase formed by the reaction of Ca(NO3)2 and EG could work as a protective layer to prevent further corrosion to some extent.

Abstract: During 3-stage thermal co-evaporation of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe), alkali aluminosilicate (AAS) glass has proven to be stable at process temperatures Tmax of up to 650 °C. This is considerably higher than the maximum endurable Tmax for soda-lime glass (SLG), which is in the range of 530–550 °C. As the Na-content of the AAS glass used here is comparable to that of SLG, growing CIGSe at elevated Tmax is expected to promote Na diffusion from the glass substrate through the Mo back contact (BC) into the absorber layer. An increased Na concentration in the CIGSe absorber would be expected to result in an improved device performance as it is mostly associated with an increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). This paper discusses the influence of varying Tmax from 530 to 650 °C during the 2nd and the 3rd stage of the 3-stage process on the morphological, electrical, and photovoltaic performance of CIGSe solar cells. Upon raising Tmax from 530 to 650 °C, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) decreased due to bandgap (Eg) widening. Glow discharge optical emission spectrometry analysis reveals that the Na concentration in the absorber is gradually decreased when elevating Tmax. As will be seen, we attribute this in part to a densification of the Mo BC during the high temperature process. A maximum conversion efficiency (η) was realized at Tmax = 600 °C. An increased Voc at Tmax = 600 °C is due to the wider Eg and to an increased carrier concentration despite the fact that the Na concentration in the CIGSe thin film was low compared to lower Tmax. Admittance spectroscopy analysis is performed to access information on defect energy level and density in the finished devices. In the light of present findings, ways to further improve η at elevated Tmax are suggested.

Abstract: The main limitation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is its maximum operating temperature, since the main fluid used as heat transfer fluid (HTF) and thermal storage media (TES) is molten salts, which degrade around 565 °C. Therefore, there is great interest in developing HTFs that allow the maximum working temperature to be increased to more than 565 °C. This increase in the maximum operating temperature of the HTFs will, in turn, allow CSP plant efficiency to be enhanced. Different studies have proposed using particles as a medium to capture and store solar energy, but very little is known about the effect on the particles after resisting several cycles of cooling and heating and what happens to the particles’ physical properties when they are fluidized. It is true that a variety of solid particles permit high performance to be achieved at high temperatures and with low material costs, but not all particles are valid for this purpose. This work focuses on different materials considered promising candidates for use as alternative HTF and storage materials in CSP plants, which were characterized and tested: sand, carbo Accucast ID50 and silicon carbide. The properties of the particles before and after being fluidized (assessing their resistance to abrasion) and before and after high temperature (900 °C) thermal treatments (aging treatment) are the main finding of this paper. This work highlights the considerable advantages of SiC and carbo over sand. This study also determines that the combination of high temperature and several hours of fluidization does not affect the diameter of the particles: However, the fluidized samples vary considerably in diameter. In this way, SEM and DSC techniques highlight the problem of the fine appearance associated with sand during fluidization.

Abstract: Solar thermoelectric power generation during the day and night-time are achieved using Alumina Nano-Enhanced Phase Change Material on the Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) cold side. The portion of the thermal energy is used to produce electricity using TEG while the rejected heat is stored in a D-Mannitol as Phase Change Material (PCM) during active hours as thermal energy. Thus, continuous power generation is achieved using Nano-Enhanced D-Mannitol (NEDM) as the PCM. The performance parameters of TEG including voltage, current and power profile of the NEDM were recorded. The experimental setup was established for thermosyphon passive and natural convection cooling. For different mixtures, heat inputs and for both types of cooling the electrical parameters were analysed for open power output and circuit voltage. A 99% D-Mannitol + 1% Alumina nanoparticle composition was observed as the optimal composition for all heat inputs and cooling. Subjecting the optimised composition to heat inputs of 10 W, 30 W, 60 W and 90 W along with thermosyphon cooling led to increased maximum average TEG electrical power outputs of 0.23 W, 1.09 W, 1.27 W and 1.33 W respectively, each being 4.04, 4.99, 3.05 and 3.24 times higher than the corresponding values of the natural cooling phase.

Abstract: Wide band gap thin-film kesterite solar cell based on non-toxic and earth-abundant materials might be a suitable candidate as a top cell for tandem configuration in combination with crystalline silicon as a bottom solar cell. For this purpose and based on parameters we have extracted from electrical and optical characterization techniques of Cu2ZnGeSe4 absorbers and solar cells, a model has been developed to describe the kesterite top cell efficiency limitations and to investigate the different possible configurations with transparent back contact for four-terminal tandem solar cell application. Furthermore, we have studied the tandem solar cell performance in view of the band gap and the transparency of the kesterite top cell and back contact engineering. Our detailed analysis shows that a kesterite top cell with efficiency > 14%, a band gap in the range of 1.5–1.7 eV and transparency above 80% at the sub-band gaps photons energies are required to achieve a tandem cell with higher efficiency than with a single silicon solar cell.

Abstract: Pentaerythritol (PE), pentaglycerine (PG), and neopentylglycol (NPG) are non-ionic plastic crystal with high potential for latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) in solar heating applications. These molecules undergo reversible solid phase transitions with unusually large enthalpy of transition (110 J/g - 300 J/g) in the temperature range from 44 °C to 185 °C. To further enhance their heat storage capacity while lowering their price and preserving the advantage of solid phase transitions, a new class of shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) in which a polyalcohol with adjustable solid phase transition properties (NPG/PG or PE/PG mixture) supports a cheaper and with higher latent heat solid-liquid PCM (paraffin wax) is proposed in this work. Combined with properly chosen paraffin waxes, NPG/PG mixtures allow tailoring the working temperature of corresponding SSPCMs between 24 °C and 81 °C, whereas PE/PG mixtures allow SSPCMs with phase change adjusted within 81 °C–190 °C temperature range. Produced SSPCMs were thoroughly characterized and their efficiency in terms of heat storage capacity and delivered power upon heat discharge were evaluated. The results achieved show proper anti-leakage effect due to good wettability between paraffins and polyalcohols and inner microstructure of SSPCMs promoting capillarity. In addition, volumetric latent heat storage capacity has been proven to be enhanced up to 45% compared to pure polyalcohols without detrimental effect in discharging power.

Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of 38 new thiosemicarbazone derivatives on hematological neoplastic cells lines and to select the most effective compounds to investigate the main molecular mechanisms involved in cell death. Cytotoxicity screening on Daudi and Jurkat cells revealed that only compound 1b met the selection criteria; therefore, it was chosen for further investigation. Cell viability of Daudi, Jurkat, Molt-4, Namalwa, K562, and MM.1S cell lines decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after compound 1b incubation; nevertheless the compound neither caused significant hemolysis nor reduction in peripheral blood mononuclear cell viability. Although no changes were observed on cell cycle or Ki-67 expression, compound 1b induced apoptotic-like cell death with mitochondrial involvement, Bax/Bcl-2 inversion, AIF release, survivin inhibition, and caspase-3 activation in both Daudi and Jurkat cells. Furthermore, the compound reduced NFκB expression in Jurkat cells. In Daudi cells, compound 1b also decreased CHOP, Akt, pAkt, and MAPK/ERK2 expression, thereby suggesting modulation of UPR, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Finally, the compound was able to reduce the cell viability of samples collected from patients with different lymphoid neoplasms subtypes, showing that thiosemicarbazones derivatives could be used in the development of new drugs with anticancer activity.

Abstract: NiCrAlO/Al2O3 solar selective coating prepared by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering and water boiling is demonstrated in this paper. Firstly, the coating consisting of tandem layers of Au/NiCrAl/Al with different NiCr volume fractions in NiCrAl sublayers is deposited solely by DC magnetron sputtering. Then the coating is boiled by deionized water and dehydrated by vacuum heating. The surface morphology, the depth distributions and relative chemical states of elements of the coating are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that Al in the coating is totally oxidized while most of NiCr and Au keep metallic after water boiling and vacuum dehydration, which forms the effective solar selective coating consisting of Au/NiCrAlO/Al2O3 with different metallic NiCr volume fractions. High near normal solar absorptance of 0.964 and low near normal thermal emittance of 0.066 are demonstrated by the reflectance measured by UV-VIS-IR spectrometer. The combination of DC magnetron sputtering and water boiling is very promising for fabrication of solar selective coating based on the dielectric aluminum oxide, as it is environmentally friendly and circumvents the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering which needs RF automatic matching.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Unsuccessful cytogenetic (US) analysis at baseline has been reported to be a poor prognostic feature in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We conducted this study to examine the prognostic impact of UC/inconclusive cytogenetic analysis on outcomes in patients with AML undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo HSCT).
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed all adults undergoing Allo HSCT for AML from January 2011 to August 2019. Patients with any documented cytogenetic abnormalities were excluded. Baseline characteristics and transplant outcomes were compared between patients with normal cytogenetics and those with UC.
Results
Overall, 243 AML patients (median age, 55 years; 55.1% female) were included. UC were reported in 79 patients, whereas 164 patients had a normal karyotype. The two groups were similar to each other in terms of baseline demographics, treatment received, and transplant related variables. There was no difference between patients with UC and normal cytogenetics in terms of relapse-free survival (66 months vs. 42 months, p = .53) or overall survival (OS; 77 months vs. 76 months, p = .72). Survival parameters remained similar even in subgroup analysis based on NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status. Significant predictors of OS after Allo HSCT in AML patients with UC were increased age at time of Allo HSCT (hazard ratio [HR] = –1.049; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.005–1.095), favorable (NPM1Mut/FLT3wt) mutation profile (HR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01–0.84), neutrophil engraftment < 17 days, and absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.20–8.60).
Conclusion
Outcomes after Allo HSCT are comparable between AML patients with UC analysis and patients with normal cytogenetics even after stratification based on molecular risk factors. Allogeneic Allo HSCT may mitigate the poor prognosis of UC analysis in patients with AML.

Abstract: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6 is associated with more diseases than any other region of the genome; it encodes the antigen-presenting Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) proteins and is one of the key immunogenetic regions of the genome. Accurate genome inference and interpretation of MHC association signals have traditionally been hampered by the region’s uniquely complex features, such as high levels of polymorphism; inter-gene sequence homologies; structural variation; and long-range haplotype structures. Recent algorithmic and technological advances have, however, significantly increased the accessibility of genetic variation in the MHC; these developments include (i) accurate SNP-based HLA type imputation; (ii) genome graph approaches for variation-aware genome inference from next-generation sequencing data; (iii) long-read-based diploid de novo assembly of the MHC; (iv) cost-effective targeted MHC sequencing methods. Applied to hundreds of thousands of samples over the last years, these technologies have already enabled significant biological discoveries, for example in the field of autoimmune disease genetics. Remaining challenges concern the development of integrated methods that leverage haplotype-resolved de novo assembly of the MHC for the development of improved MHC genotyping methods for short reads and the construction of improved reference panels for SNP-based imputation. Improved genome inference in the MHC can crucially contribute to an improved genetic and functional understanding of many immune-related phenotypes and diseases.

Abstract: Composite phase change materials (CPCM) with improved thermal properties were fabricated by encapsulating stearic acid (SA) into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with carbon fiber (CF). The HDPE acted as the supporting materials to prevent SA leakage. CF was introduced to enhance the thermal conductivity of the CPCM. Some characterization measurements were carried out to investigate the CPCM thermal properties. The patterns of Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) revealed that the SA, HDPE and CF were combined physically, and the crystal structure of the mixture remained constant. The results of scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) indicated that the microstructure of the CPCM was relatively stable. The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that the melting point and latent heat of CPCM6 were 68.48 °C and 140.17 kJ/kg, and the solidifying point and latent heat were 66.95 °C and 141.09 kJ/kg. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) verified that the CPCM had an improved thermal stability within the working temperature range. The thermal conductivity of CPCM6 was 0.4043 W/m⋅K, which is 2.22 times greater than for SA. The addition of CF effectively enhanced the thermal conductivity of the SA. Overall, CPCM6 possesses the potential for application in heat storage fields.

Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in endothelium protects against oxidant stress-induced endothelial injury,

Abstract: Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT, EC 2.1.1.1.) plays an important role in the growth of many different tumours and is also involved in various non-neoplastic disorders. However, the presence and role of NNMT in the endothelium has yet to be specifically explored. Here, we characterized the functional activity of NNMT in the endothelium and tested whether NNMT regulates endothelial cell viability. NNMT in endothelial cells (HAEC, HMEC-1 and EA.hy926) was inhibited using two approaches: pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme by NNMT inhibitors (5-amino-1-methylquinoline – 5MQ and 6-methoxynicotinamide – JBSF-88) or by shRNA-mediated silencing. Functional inhibition of NNMT was confirmed by LC/MS/MS-based analysis of impaired MNA production. The effects of NNMT inhibition on cellular viability were analyzed in both the absence and presence of menadione. Our results revealed that all studied endothelial lines express relatively high levels of functionally active NNMT compared with cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Although the aldehyde oxidase 1 enzyme was also expressed in the endothelium, the further metabolites of N1-methylnicotinamide (N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide) generated by this enzyme were not detected, suggesting that endothelial NNMT-derived MNA was not subsequently metabolized in the endothelium by aldehyde oxidase 1. Menadione induced a concentration-dependent decrease in endothelial viability as evidenced by a decrease in cell number that was associated with the upregulation of NNMT and SIRT1 expression in the nucleus in viable cells. The suppression of the NNMT activity either by NNMT inhibitors or shRNA-based silencing significantly decreased the endothelial cell viability in response to menadione. Furthermore, NNMT inhibition resulted in nuclear SIRT1 expression downregulation and upregulation of the phosphorylated form of SIRT1 on Ser47. In conclusion, our results suggest that the endothelial nuclear NNMT/SIRT1 pathway exerts a cytoprotective role that safeguards endothelial cell viability under oxidant stress insult.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Individuals with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) may manifest various forms of renal abnormalities. Proteinuria is an early marker of renal dysfunction and a strong risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in both patients with SCA and non-SCA population. Currently, the degree of attention given to proteinuric CKD far exceeds that of nonproteinuric CKD, and risk factors that might trigger a progressive decline of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the absence of proteinuria have not been well evaluated in SCA. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and laboratory parameters among SCA patients with proteinuric and nonproteinuric CKD.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital in north-eastern Nigeria between January 2013 and April 2018. Clinical variables including age of diagnosis of SCA, frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, number of hospitalizations per annum and transfusion therapy were collected. Laboratory data including haematological profile and renal function test were obtained from routine blood sampling.
Results
A total of 257 patients with SCA (HbSS) were enrolled during the study period of which 42 had proteinuric CKD, and 48 had nonproteinuric CKD. The two groups were matched for the number of hospital admission (p = .063) and blood transfusion per year (p = .450), frequency of painful crisis (p = .210), systolic blood pressure (p = .084) and diastolic blood pressure (p = .400). In the proteinuric CKD group, the mean serum creatinine was higher (332.17 µmol/L, p = .001) and the estimated GFR was lower (31.88 mL/min, p = .046). The serum alkaline phosphatase was higher in the nonproteinuric CKD group (81.81 IU/L, p = .012).
Conclusion
Nonproteinuric CKD was more frequent than proteinuric CKD in our study population; however, the proteinuric group presented with more advanced disease.

Abstract: In this paper we report a detailed investigation on the structural, electrical, and optical properties of Mo-doped ITO (ITMO) thin films. ITMO was deposited at room temperature by RF magnetron co-sputtering from ITO and Mo targets, and also thermal annealed up to 500 °C after the growth. The analyses revealed a high doping efficiency of the Mo already at room temperature. Moreover, a strong improvement of the electrical and optical properties is observed after thermal process. In particular, at T ≥ 300 °C, a drastic enhancement of the optical transparency in the visible and near-IR region was found, accompanied by a strong lowering of the electrical resistivity. The effects with temperature can be ascribed to the annealing of structural defects, as demonstrated by the Tauc's optical analysis and by the enhancement of the carrier mobility. XPS analyses give evidence of the preferential formation of the Mo6+ (MoO3) with respect to the Mo4+ (MoO2) and Mo0 (metallic Mo) oxidation states. These results confirm the important role of Mo as dopant or co-dopant of In oxide based TCO.

Abstract: Spent coffee grounds (SCGs), a kind of highly recyclable and useable biomass, are often ignored, discarded, and further become a serious environmental threat. In this work, effective high-value utilization of SCGs in the field of composite phase change materials (CPCMs) was proposed. SCGs with the introduction of 1–5 wt% reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were used as supporting material to stabilize the shape of the CPCMs to solve problems of leakage and low light-to-heat conversion. RGO-modified SCGs (SCGs@RGO) have a better three-dimensional porous structure than pristine SCGs, therefore absorbing 60.3 wt% PEG and having excellent leakage-proof performance and showing slight thermal conductivity enhancements. SCGs@RGO has strong absorption in the full UV–Vis–NIR range, hence it exhibits extremely strong light-to-heat conversion capacity and stores solar thermal energy in a short time (245 s) of light. Besides, PEG/SCGs@RGO CPCMs show good reusability, chemical stability, crystalline stability, and excellent thermal stability in phase change tests up to 100 cycles.

Abstract: Br-rich inorganic perovskite CsPbIBr2, has gained intense attention for photovoltaic application owing to its excellent thermal stability and appropriate band gap for the top cell of tandem solar cell. However, in most case, the open voltage (Voc) of highly efficient CsPbIBr2 solar cell is below 1.3 V which is far from the requirement for a top cell. Herein, a novel multi-source cation/anion co-doping strategy has been used in CsPbIBr2 solar cell, which produces multiple benefits to improve the device performance. Using a multi-source co-doping strategy, carbon-based planar CsPbIBr2 solar cell achieved a respectable Voc of 1.37 V with an efficiency of 10.78%, which is the highest Voc reported for highly efficient CsPbIBr2 solar cell so far. This simple multi-source cation/anion doping strategy not only improves the film quality but also strengthens built-in potential, resulting in the significant enhancement of Voc. Moreover, device with multi-source co-doping shows a much better long-term stability than that of undoped device. This work opens up a facile and efficient method to improve the Voc and efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cell for tandem solar cell and other optoelectronic application.

Abstract: The DYRK (Dual-specificity tYrosine-phosphorylation Regulated protein Kinase) family consists of five related protein kinases (DYRK1A, DYRK1B, DYRK2, DYRK3, DYRK4). DYRKs show homology to Drosophila Minibrain, and DYRK1A in human chromosome 21 is responsible for various neuronal disorders including human Down syndrome. Here we report identification of cellular proteins that associate with specific members of DYRKs. Cellular proteins with molecular masses of 90, 70, and 50-kDa associated with DYRK1B and DYRK4. These proteins were identified as molecular chaperones Hsp90, Hsp70, and Cdc37, respectively. Microscopic analysis of GFP-DYRKs showed that DYRK1A and DYRK1B were nuclear, while DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4 were mostly cytoplasmic in COS7 cells. Overexpression of DYRK1B induced nuclear re-localization of these chaperones with DYRK1B. Treatment of cells with specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and 17-AAG, abolished the association of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with DYRK1B and DYRK4, but not of Hsp70. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone activity affected intracellular dynamics of DYRK1B and DYRK4. DYRK1B and DYRK4 underwent rapid formation of cytoplasmic punctate dots after the geldanamycin treatment, suggesting that the chaperone function of Hsp90 is required for prevention of protein aggregation of the target kinases. Prolonged inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin, 17-AAG, or ganetespib, decreased cellular levels of DYRK1B and DYRK4. Finally, DYRK1B and DYRK4 were ubiquitinated in cells, and ubiquitinated DYRK1B and DYRK4 further increased by Hsp90 inhibition with geldanamycin. Taken together, these results indicate that Hsp90 and Cdc37 discriminate specific members of the DYRK kinase family and play an important role in quality control of these client kinases in cells.

Abstract: An enormous attention has been paid to cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) blue pigments owing to their significant hue of blue colour. Nevertheless, several serious disadvantages, such as high cost due to the high cobalt consumption and poor solar reflectance, are associated with this pigment. Therefore, the development of cost effective and sustainable blue pigments with reduced Co content and improved solar reflectivity is a major focused area in pigment research. Herein, a new series of multifunctional blue coloured inorganic pigments with low cobalt content were prepared via the solid-state method. The structural and spectroscopic evaluations were indicated that the strong blue colour could be generated because of the distorted tetrahedrally organized cobalt chromophore. This structural distortion of the chromophore geometry was linked to the covalency and electron affinity factors. Colour (b* = −59.21) and solar reflectance (R* = 64%) measurements of the optimized composition (NaZn0.9Co0.1PO4) was observed to be superior than the commercially available CoAl2O4 blue pigment. Meanwhile, the optimized pigment loaded epoxy coated steel substrate in marine medium exhibited impressive corrosion resistance properties. The anticorrosive mechanism, further established through the XPS results, validated that the phosphatized inhibitive film served as the barrier for corrosion. The estimated Co content in NaZn0.9Co0.1PO4 was found to be around 10 times lower than the CoAl2O4 blue pigment indicating the cost-effective nature. The optimized pigment was able to retain its optical properties in the prepared acrylic coatings on Al sheet and concrete block. Further, the temperature shielding studies ensured a reduction of ~4 °C in comparison with CoAl2O4 coatings. Therefore, the developed multifunctional blue pigment could be employed for the economic production of blue exterior paint for anticorrosive cool roof coatings.

Abstract: Neutrophils, the early responders of the immune system, eliminate intruders, but their over-activation can also instigate tissue damage leading to various autoimmune and inflammatory disease conditions. As approaches causing neutropenia are associated with immunodeficiency, targeting aberrant neutrophil infiltration offers an attractive strategy in neutrophil-centered diseases including acute lung injury. Rho GTPase family proteins Rho, Rac and Cdc42 play important role as regulators of chemotaxis in diverse systems. Rho inhibitors protected against lung injuries, while genetic Rho-deficiency exhibited neutrophil hyperactivity and exacerbated lung injury. These differential outcomes might be due to distinct effects on different cell types or activation/ inhibition of specific signaling pathways responsible for neutrophil polarity, migration and functions. In this study, we explored neutrophil centric effects of Rho signaling mitigation. Consistent with previous reports, Rho signaling inhibitor Y-27632 provided protection against acute lung injury, but without regulating LPS mediated systemic increase of neutrophils in the circulation. Interestingly, the adoptive transfer approach identified a specific defect in neutrophil migration capacity after Rho signaling mitigation. These defects were associated with loss of polarity and altered actin dynamics identified using time-lapse in vitro studies. Further analysis revealed a rescue of stimulation-dependent L-selectin shedding on neutrophils with Rho signaling inhibitor. Surprisingly, functional blocking of L-selectin (CD62L) led to defective recruitment of neutrophils into inflamed lungs. Further, single-cell level analyses identified MAPK signaling as downstream mechanism of Rho signaling and L-selectin mediated effects. p-AKT levels were diminished in detergent resistance membrane-associated signalosome upon Rho signaling inhibition and blockade of selectin. Moreover, inhibition of AKT signaling as well as selectin blocking led to defects in neutrophil polarity. Together, this study identified Rho-dependent distinct L-selectin and AKT signaling mediated regulation of neutrophil recruitment to inflamed lung tissue.

Abstract: Solar-driven water evaporation is considered an environmental-friendly method for energy-efficient clean water production. However, directly using solar energy to generate steam is impractical due to its high cost, complex systems, and low efficiency. Herein, a candle soot (CS)/adsorbent cotton (AC) 3D-interfacial solar steam generation (3D-ISSG) with simple configuration and off-grid operation was reported by depositing low cost and conveniently fabrication candle soot nanoparticles on adsorbent cotton matrix via a simple home-made process. In this system, the 3D photothermal cone was introduced to separate the contact area between bulk water and the CS/AC membrane to minimize the heat loss, accordingly achieving an efficient interface heating to further improve the water evaporation rate. The synthesized CS/AC 3D-ISSG is easy to fabricate, thus achieving a lower cost for water evaporation. The fabricated CS/AC 3D-ISSG achieved water evaporation rates of 1.27 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun with a solar thermal conversion efficiency up to 80.70%. The results of this work provide a reference for further study of photothermal materials with low cost and excellent properties and their application in clean water production.

Rcf proteins and their differential specificity for respiratory chain complexes: A unique role for Rcf2 on oxygen sensitive supercomplexes?,

Abstract: The respiratory chain, embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, is organized as a network of individual complexes, as well as large supercomplex structures. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, these supercomplexes consist of a dimeric cytochrome bc1-complex adjoined by one or two copies of cytochrome c oxidase. The formation of these complexes is a dynamic process and is regulated by various factors in order to adapt to environmental and metabolic changes. These adaptions occur at the level of enzyme regulation, complex assembly, as well as altered nuclear and mitochondrial transcription and translation. Members of the Rcf protein family (Rcf1, Rcf2 and Rcf3) are required for respiratory complex biogenesis and act mainly by regulating the assembly and enzyme activity of complex IV within supercomplexes. Rcf1 functions in the assembly process via the COX3 module, whereas Rcf2 and Rcf3 are responsible for enzymatic regulation. In this study, we have extended this knowledge to show that Rcf2 and Rcf3 can also associate with newly synthesized mitochondrial encoded proteins, such as Cox3, and therefore contribute to complex IV assembly. Since the Rcf proteins have overlapping regions of sequence similarities, we engineered novel fusion proteins of Rcf1 and Rcf3, with parts of Rcf2, to probe which of the Rcf protein domains can be attributed to their functions. The fusion proteins could compensate for the individual phenotypes of the complexIV assembly defect and the lack of complex IV regulation. Finally, the role of Rcf proteins for defined species of respiratory chain complexes in a hypoxic model was investigated, uncovering a unique association of Rcf2 with the hypoxic III2IV supercomplex. We therefore suggest an involvement of Rcf2 for adaption of the respiratory chain to altering oxygen levels.

Abstract: We report on the facile synthesis of anatase multi-doped TiO2 mesocrystals with highly energetic {001} facets and their outstanding photocatalytic activity. The structural and compositional properties were investigated via different techniques such as XRD, XPS, Raman photoluminescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance, which confirmed the fabrication of C, Co, and Ti3+-doped anatase single crystal-like mesocrystals. The Mott-Schottky analysis showed a drastic increase in the carrier density upon cobalt doping, resulting in a 6-fold increase in the photoelectrochemical performance compared to the undoped sample. Besides, the photocatalytic efficiency of the as-fabricated mesocrystals in the photochemical production of hydrogen was estimated under AM1.5 conditions without using any hole scavengers. The Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2 mesocrystals showed an unprecedented hydrogen production rate when compared to the other similar titanium-based mesocrystals. Finally, the unprecedented enhancement of Co-doped C/Ti3+ TiO2 mesocrystals in water splitting makes them promising candidates for various photocatalytic applications.

Abstract: Low activation energy (Ea) and wide bandgap (Eg) are essential for (p)-contacts to achieve effective hole collection in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. In this work, we study Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition p-type hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon oxide, (p)nc-SiOx:H, combined with (p)nc-Si:H as (p)-contact in front/back-contacted SHJ solar cells. We firstly determine the effect of a plasma treatment at the (i)a-Si:H/(p)-contact interface on the thickness-dependent Ea of (p)-contacts. Notably, when the (p)nc-Si:H layer is thinner than 20 nm, the Ea decreases by applying a hydrogen plasma treatment and a very-high-frequency (i)nc-Si:H treatment. Such an interface treatment also significantly reduces the contact resistivity of the (p)-contact stacks (ρc,p), resulting in an improvement of 6.1%abs in fill factor (FF) of the completed cells. Thinning down the (i)a-Si:H passivating layer to 5 nm leads to a low ρc,p (144 mΩ⋅cm2) for (p)-contact stacks. Interestingly, we observe an increment of FF from 72.9% to 78.3% by using (p)nc-SiOx:H layers featuring larger differences between their optical gap (E04) and Ea, which tend to enhance the built-in potential at the c-Si/(i)a-Si:H interface. Furthermore, we observe clear impacts on ρc,p, open-circuit voltage, and FF by optimizing the thicknesses of (p)-contact that influence its Ea. In front junction cells, the vertical and lateral collection of holes is affected by ρc,p of (p)-contact stacks. This observation is also supported by TCAD simulations which reveal different components of lateral contributions. Lastly, we obtain both front and rear junction cells with certified FF well-above 80% and the best efficiency of 22.47%.

Abstract: A new type of device with adjustable reflective capabilities in the mid-IR is elaborated from the combination of Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/Poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), gold-coated non-porous polyimide substrate and gel electrolyte. Prior to device characterization, the influence of polymer thickness and gold substrate types on reflectance modulation of PEDOT-Au films is scrutinized to obtain the film with optimum quality. A combination of SEM images and reflectance curves confirms that adopting thin PEDOT/PSS on the non-porous substrate can achieve large amplitude reflectance regulation. Further, a mechanical perforating method is developed to address the issue that ions cannot transport between the polymer film and the counter electrode when this PEDOT/non-porous film assembled into device. An in-depth study shows that by varying the punching side, porosity and aperture, a device with front holes of porosity 12.77% affords the highest reflectance contrast of 0.566 over the wavelength range of 3-5 μm, meanwhile exhibits effective temperature changes of approximately 16 °C. These results inspire interesting perspectives regarding the fabrication of PEDOT-based devices with controllable IR electroreflective performance.

Abstract: Background
Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a peculiar disease with few studies that have investigated the prognostic significance of PML/RARA transcript level at diagnosis.
Patients and methods
This retrospective study included all cases diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia over the period from June 2015 to March 2019. The normalized copy number (NCN) was tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis, and at the end of induction regimen.
Results
Our study included 83 de novo APL patients, 53 (63.9%) were adults and 30 (36.1%) were children. The median (range) age of our patients was 28.0 (1.0–70.0) years. The pediatric group had a significantly higher prevalence in males (p = 0.02), higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (p = 0.014), and high-risk groups (p = 0.017). At diagnosis, the median NCN (%) of the entire group at 22.5 was set as the cut off value. There was no significant association between NCN at diagnosis and other prognostic variables except for bone marrow promyelocytes (p = 0.006). High-risk group APL patients as well as those presenting with hemorrhage had an inferior overall survival (OS) (p = 0.007; p < 0.001) respectively. PML-RARA NCN at diagnosis did not have an impact on the OS or increased risk of relapse of our patients (p = 0.434; p = 0.721).
Conclusion
the initial PML/RARA tumor burden is not a prognostic factor for APL. The initial TLC at 10x109/L cut off is the most important predictive for OS. Early detection and close monitoring are required to decrease the high rate of early deaths in developing countries.

Abstract: The natural lawn needs complex maintenance (e.g., fertilizer dressing, manicuring, soil disinfection and disinsection), so the artificial lawn is increasingly desired and applied in the sports arena. However, the most artificial lawns are made of the organic materials, which could accumulate the thermal energy under direct sunlight. The accumulated thermal energy also leads to increasing the temperature of the artificial lawn and its surroundings, which eventually impact the athletic experience. Moreover, an efficient, eco-friendly, and economical technique that can provide the cooling for the artificial lawns without extensive energy input is lacking. Herein, a novel inorganic-polymeric composite for preparing passive daytime radiative cooling artificial lawn using chromium oxide (Cr2O3) particle-embedded high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is demonstrated. By reflecting 50% NIR irradiance and radiating heat through the atmosphere’s long-wave infrared transmission window (LWIR, εLWIR = 0.86), this composite-covered device displayed a temperature of 30.7 °C, much lower than those of HDPE-covered device (43.4 °C) under solar simulator (intensity~0.34 W/cm2). Similarly, this composite exhibits a better cooling effect than the neat HDPE under direct sunlight. Moreover, for further improving the cooling property of the composite, the titanium dioxide (TiO2) was utilized to enhance the reflectance of the HDPE/Cr2O3 composite without affecting the visual effect and thermal emissivity, where the total reflectance increases by 5%. Meanwhile, the outdoor thermal measurement showed that the cooling effect of the HDPE/Cr2O3/TiO2 composite artificial lawn is on a par with that of the natural lawn.

Abstract: The phase change materials (PCMs) are attractive and environmental-friendly way to improve the utilization rate in the field of photothermal conversion and solar radiation storage. However, the low photothermal conversion efficiency and low thermal conductivity characteristics of PCMs limit their practical applications. In order to improve the performance of these materials, we developed a novel polyethylene glycol (PEG 2000) PCMs composites supported by Ti3C2Tx@polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam skeleton with several advantages like low-cost, scalable and simple preparation method by freeze-drying after PEG being introduced into the skeleton via vacuum impregnation. The thermal conductivity of Ti3C2Tx/PEG composite containing 7.68 wt% skeleton was notably high as 0.428 W/(m·K)，which was 4.2 times higher than PEG 2000 (0.101 W/(m·K)). The improvement of thermal conductivity was mainly derived from the three-dimensional interconnected structures of the foamy skeleton. The actual phase change enthalpy of composite searched up to 131.1 J/g, and its photothermal conversion efficiency achieved 96.5%, demonstrating excellent photothermal conversion and storage ability. Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx/PEG composite exhibited structural stable property that avoids leakage of liquefied PCM during melting process. This multifunctional Ti3C2Tx@PVA/PEG PCM provided a prospective application in thermal energy management systems regarding its high thermal conductivity, excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, thermal energy storage (TES) capability and structural stability.

Abstract: We have simulated a perovskite solar cell by developing a comprehensive mathematical model which incorporates drift-diffusion and heat transfer equations. This model incorporates all the heat transfer mechanisms, including the thermal power generation due to the tail state recombination and thermalization of charge carriers. Our model is validated by calculating the current-voltage characteristics of a PSC of the structure of Glass/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Al and finding it in very good agreement with the experimental results. The influence of grain boundary diameter on the operating temperature of the PSC is investigated in detail. It is found that by increasing the diameter of the grain boundaries, the operating temperature of the PSC decreases at higher voltages and the open circuit voltage increases slightly. The thermal power generated by the thermalization is found to play the dominant role in the operating temperature followed by the thermal power generated at the grain boundaries due to the highest tail state recombination in the region. This study is expected to provide a deeper understanding about different factors that influence the operating temperature of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Elabela/toddler is the second endogenous ligand recently identified after Apelin, that binds to the G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Elabela is a 54-amino acid peptide initially identified in fish and human genomes and classified as noncoding. This precursor can be cleaved to shorter sequences (32, 21, and 11 amino acids), which bind and activate APJ, and can be blocked by APJ antagonists. Contrary to Apelin and APJ, widely distributed in organs and tissues, Elabela expression is more restricted, and different studies have revealed the potential role of Elabela in cancers. This review summarizes the current studies focusing on the role of Elabela in different cancers.

Abstract: Composites carbon foams based on sucrose-based char matrix and graphite filler were prepared and characterised with the aim of hosting sugar alcohols as phase-change materials (PCMs) in the context of thermal energy storage (TES). Seasonal solar TES demands an excellent undercooling of the molten PCM infiltrated in the foam, so that the heat can be stored as long as possible. The present paper demonstrates how the surface of such composite foams, i.e., comprising two carbon phases of different reactivities, can be modified for promoting undercooling. For that purpose, 8 different hydrophobisation treatments were applied, and the results were compared with those of the non-treated foam, in which heterogeneous nucleation could not be avoided. We show that one kind of functionalisation was successful, i.e., it fully preserved the melting point and the enthalpy of melting of the hosted phase-change material and completely avoided the heterogeneous nucleation of the PCM, while maintaining the thermal conductivity in the range required for this kind of application.

Abstract: III-Sb semiconductors cover the whole 0.29–1.64 eV bandgap range, allowing us to grow several subcells of a multi-junction solar cell lattice-matched to GaSb. Among III-Sb alloys, AlInAsSb exhibits the broadest range of direct bandgaps, making it a promising material for photovoltaic applications. In this work, the behavior of two AlInAsSb/GaSb tandem photovoltaic cells is studied. Material characterization and physics-based 1D modeling are carried out to analyze and discuss performance of the cells. An efficiency of 5.2% is achieved under 1-sun illumination, limited by the AlInAsSb quaternary-alloy properties.

Abstract: The present work aimed to find the answer how does the isomerization of the Ru based dyes affect the overall photon-to-current efficiency of the DSSCs and to explain the charge transfer phenomenon occurring on the dye/nanosemiconductor interface. Therefore, electronic and optical properties of three bipyridine derivatives anchored on the TiO2 electrode were investigated by computational simulations based on quantum chemistry codes performed on a cluster model and the predictions compared with experimental responses. The quantum chemical calculations carried out for the para-, meta- and ortho-isomers has given the possibility to explain the role of an anchor group position in the DSSC devices design. An in-depth analysis of the obtained data shows that the nature of the bonding between the anchor groups and the semiconducting nanoparticles affects the charge transfer at the interfaces. The electronic properties obtained for the hybrid systems and their components indicate that solar cells with the para-derivatives of the Ru based dyes as sensitizers exhibit the highest photo conversion efficiency. The observed phenomenon was explained based on the photogenerated excitons in the organic groups and their dissociation at the dye/semiconductor interfaces to ensure the free charge carriers.

Abstract: High voltage stress at the rear side of bifacial PERC cells leads to severe power losses. In contrast to monofacial PERC solar cells, reversible de-polarization related potential induced degradation (PID-p) and irreversible corrosive potential induced degradation (PID-c) can occur. Our results show that a reliable assessment of the solar cells power losses requires a modified PID test method which includes illumination in addition to the high voltage stress test. Furthermore, a recovery step needs to be added to the test scheme to separate reversible PID-p contributions from irreversible PID-c damages. We show that both, the degree of degradation as well as the contributions of PID-p and PIC-c depend sensitively on the solar cell under consideration. Thus, we propose to include both illumination during PID stress as well as a recovery step in the PID test scheme for bifacial PERC cells. Additionally, we show that the most sensitive cell parameter for the detection of rear side PID is given by the rear side measurement of the short circuit current. Finally, we present results showing that a 0.1 sun illumination during this characterization step is sufficient for an assessment of the PID. Based on these results, we propose a test setup which combines the required stress test conditions with an in-situ tracking of the PID.

Abstract: Recently, a functional IP3R ortholog (CO.IP3R-A) capable of IP3-induced Ca2+ release has been discovered in Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular relative to Metazoa. In contrast to mammalian IP3Rs, CO.IP3R-A is not modulated by Ca2+, ATP or PKA. Protein-sequence analysis revealed that CO.IP3R-A contained a putative binding site for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, although Bcl-2 was not detected in Capsaspora owczarzaki and only appeared in Metazoa. Here, we examined whether human Bcl-2 could form a complex with CO.IP3R-A channels and modulate their Ca2+-flux properties using ectopic expression approaches in a HEK293 cell model in which all three IP3R isoforms were knocked out. We demonstrate that human Bcl-2 via its BH4 domain could functionally interact with CO.IP3R-A, thereby suppressing Ca2+ flux through CO.IP3R-A channels. The BH4 domain of Bcl-2 was sufficient for interaction with CO.IP3R-A channels. Moreover, mutating the Lys17 of Bcl-2's BH4 domain, the residue critical for Bcl-2-dependent modulation of mammalian IP3Rs, abrogated Bcl-2's ability to bind and inhibit CO.IP3R-A channels. Hence, this raises the possibility that a unicellular ancestor of animals already had an IP3R that harbored a Bcl-2-binding site. Bcl-2 proteins may have evolved as controllers of IP3R function by exploiting this pre-existing site, thereby counteracting Ca2+-dependent apoptosis.

Abstract: The Mad2 protein plays a key role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function. The SAC pathway delays mitotic progression into anaphase until all kinetochores attach to the spindle during mitosis. The formation of the Mad2–p31comet complex correlates with the completion of spindle attachment and the entry into anaphase during mitosis. Herein, we showed that dynein intermediate chain 2c (DNCI2c)—a subunit of dynein motor protein—forms an immunocomplex with p31comet during mitosis. DNCI2c-knockdown resulted in prolonged mitotic arrest in a Mad2-dependent manner. Furthermore, DNCI2c-knockdown-induced mitotic arrest was not rescued by p31comet overexpression. However, the combination of p31comet overexpression with the mitotic drug treatment reversed the mitotic arrest in DNCI2c-knockdown. Together, these results indicate that the DNCI2c–p31comet complex plays an important role in exiting Mad2-dependent SAC.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that plays a pivotal role in folding, activating and assembling a variety of client proteins. In addition, HSP90 has recently emerged as a crucial regulator of vesicular transport of cellular proteins. In our previous study, we revealed Rab11b negatively regulated osteoclastogenesis by promoting the lysosomal proteolysis of c-fms and RANK surface receptors via the axis of early endosome-late endosome-lysosomes. In this study, using an in vitro model of osteoclasts differentiated from murine macrophage-like RAW-D cells, we revealed that Rab11b interacted with both HSP90 isoforms, HSP90 alpha (HSP90α) and HSP90 beta (HSP90β), suggesting that Rab11b is an HSP90 client. Using at specific blocker for HSP90 ATPase activity, 17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), we found that the HSP90 ATPase domain is indispensable for maintaining the interaction between HSP90 and Rab11b in osteoclasts. Nonetheless, its ATPase activity is not required for regulating the turnover of endogenous Rab11b. Interestingly, blocking the interaction between HSP90 and Rab11b by either HSP90-targeting small interfering RNA (siHSP90) or 17-AAG abrogated the inhibitory effects of Rab11b on osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the Rab11b-mediated transport of c-fms and RANK surface receptors to lysosomes via the axis of early endosome-late endosome-lysosomes, alleviating the Rab11b-mediated proteolysis of these surface receptors in osteoclasts. Based on our observations, we propose a HSP90/Rab11b-mediated regulatory mechanism for osteoclastogenesis by directly modulating the c-fms and RANK surface receptors in osteoclasts, thereby contributing to the maintenance of bone homeostasis.

Abstract: Phase change materials are most potential candidates for storing solar thermal energy with large enthalpy and high exergy. However, the intrinsic drawback such as poor optical absorptive capacity, low thermal conductivity and poor tensile strength restrict the thermal efficiency of phase change materials. To overcome drawback, expanded graphite is used to encapsulate the paraffin then thermoplastic elastomer is used to mix with the powders with twin-screw extrusion technology. The highly flexible phase change composite shows a melting enthalpy of 124.6 J g−1 and a thermal conductivity of 2.2 W m−1 K−1 with 70% of expanded graphite/paraffin. The tensile strength of 2.1 MPa and a breaking elongation of 220%. This flexible phase change composite demonstrates good photo-thermal energy charging/discharging property and shows much larger exergy than traditional fluids in the solar thermal energy systems.

Abstract: Agonist-mediated exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies underpins the endothelium’s ability to respond to injury or infection. Much of this important response is mediated by the major constituent of Weibel-Palade bodies: the ultra-large glycoprotein von Willebrand factor. Upon regulated WPB exocytosis, von Willebrand factor multimers unfurl into long, platelet-catching ‘strings’ which instigate the pro-haemostatic response. Accordingly, excessive levels of VWF are associated with thrombotic pathologies, including myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. Failure to appropriately cleave von Willebrand Factor strings results in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a life-threatening pathology characterised by tissue ischaemia and multiple microvascular occlusions. Historically, treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has relied heavily on plasma exchange therapy. However, the demonstrated efficacy of Rituximab and Caplacizumab in the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura highlights how insights into pathophysiology can improve treatment options for von Willebrand factor-related disease. Directly limiting von Willebrand factor release from Weibel-Palade bodies has the potential as a therapeutic for cardiovascular disease. Cell biologists aim to map the WPB biogenesis and secretory pathways in order to find novel ways to control von Willebrand factor release. Emerging paradigms include the modulation of Weibel-Palade body size, trafficking and mechanism of fusion. This review focuses on the promise, progress and challenges of targeting Weibel-Palade bodies as a means to inhibit von Willebrand factor release from endothelial cells.

Abstract: Molten salts-based nanofluids have been widely considered for Thermal Energy Storage (TES) applications due to their enhanced thermophysical properties. However, the application of such fluids faces many challenges, among which are the correct determination of their properties, stability, compatibility with construction materials and the overall environmental impact. In this work, we attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of nanofluids based on nano-alumina and molten carbonate salt for the benefit of next-generation high-temperature TES applications. In particular, considerable statistics, cross-verification, novel preparation and characterization methods were applied to record ~12% increase of thermal conductivity, ~7% increase of heat capacity and ~35% increase of viscosity. It was demonstrated that such nanofluids have poor dispersion stability under static conditions; however, the enhanced thermophysical properties can be maintained by mechanical stimuli, e.g. mixing or redistribution. We show that some nanoparticles interact with typical construction materials such as stainless steel 310 by forming mixed oxides and considerably reducing the corrosion rates. An erosion study has been performed demonstrating negligible effect of nanoparticles even in the case of their strong agglomeration. Finally, life cycle analysis revealed that viscosity and preparation method of such nanofluids must be targeted to minimize the environmental impact.
