Abstract: A solid state electrochromic device has been fabricated using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) doped Ethyl viologen (EV) and polythiophene (P3HT) layers. The MoS2 nano flower has been synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method and characterized by electron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The prepared solid state electrochromic device shows its improved electrochromic performance like switching speed, cycle life and coloration efficiency while showing color modulation between magenta and blue colors. A very small external (±1.4 V) bias is sufficient to switch the device very quickly by taking time as low as 400 ms and shows the transmittance modulation of 42%. It is proposed that the MoS2 having graphene like 2D layered structure and the weak van der Waals force present between layers facilitates large amount of charge movement between the film and electrolyte, hence, promoting the high transfer rate of electrons, which plays the key role to enhance the performance of electrochromic device. Incorporation of MoS2 makes one of the most efficient devices in the family of polythiophene-viologen based devices and opened up a new avenues for other hybrid electrochromic device as graphene alternatives by exhibiting coloration efficiencies of as high as 580 cm2/C.

Abstract: Here, we show that Caveolin-2 (Cav-2) is an epigenetic regulator for adipogenesis. Upon adipogenic stimulation, inner nuclear membrane (INM)-targeted pY19-Cav-2 interacted with lamin A/C to disengage the repressed Cebpb promoter from lamin A/C, which facilitated the Cebpb promoter association with lamin B1. Consequently, pY19-Cav-2 recruited lysine demethylase 4b (KDM4b) for demethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone acetyltransferase GCN5 for acetylation of H3K27, and subsequently RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on Cebpb promoter for epigenetic activation of Cebpb, to initiate adipogenesis. Cav-2 knock-down abrogated the Cebpb activation and blocked the Pparg2 and Cebpa activation. Re-expression of Cav-2 restored Cebpb activation and adipogenesis in Cav-2-deficient preadipocytes. Our data identify a new mechanism by which the epigenetic activation of Cebpb is controlled at the nuclear periphery to promote adipogenesis.

Abstract: In this work, we present the development of passivating contacts based on thin interfacial oxide/doped poly-silicon for two side contacted c-Si solar cells. In the first part, we discuss our layer optimization towards direct metallisation, using firing through of Ag-paste screen printed on a silicon nitride (SiNx:H). By optimising the poly-silicon thickness, we obtain solar cells with open circuit voltage (VOC) up to 700 mV and fill factor (FF) up to 78%. However, such results were obtained by using layers with a thickness of 95 nm, strongly limiting the short circuit current density. To overcome this limitation, we present in the second part an approach for localization of the front side passivating contact by means of deposition through a shadow mask. Finally, in the third part, we demonstrate high-efficiency c-Si solar cells with promising efficiency above 21.7% with a VOC of ∼711 mV, a high FF of 79.7% and a potential for efficiency >22%.

Abstract: A liquid marble is a droplet coated with hydrophobic particles. Due to the large capillary energy associated with particle adsorption, this particle-armed liquid normally sustains long-term stability rather than evaporation under ambient condition. Conversely, we show here experimentally that liquid marbles coating with photothermal nanoparticles can significantly accelerate the liquid evaporation under solar irradiation. A series of experiment in solar evaporation of water drops, nanofluid drops as well as liquid marbles are conducted under controlled condition to verify this concept. It is found that the liquid marble exhibits the highest evaporation rate among the three cases. This high performance is attributed to the plasmon-coupling effect between neighboring nanoparticles along the drop surface, creating a high-temperature thermal boundary for intense evaporation of the interfacial liquid. While solar evaporation of nanofluid induces multiple scattering events among the nanoparticles that increases photon absorption within the drop domain, resulting in a collective heating to enhance the evaporation. Numerical modelling is further introduced to disclose the temperature distribution in these photothermic systems. Despite its diffusion nature, the temperature distribution can be engineered highly non-uniform and concentrated at the nanoscale using the particle assemblies in close proximity. A significant degree of nanoscale control over the individual temperatures of neighboring particles is demonstrated, depending on the interparticle gaps and dielectric surrounding media. Our findings open new possibilities for flexible control of photothermal processes and precisely heat delivery for solar vapor generation or local welding of textured nanomaterial.

Abstract: Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench (Ep) is widely used as a kind of dietary supplements, and possesses various pharmacological activities, including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antitumor effects. However, the inhibitory effects of Ep on the growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. Here, the preventive effect and potential mechanism of Ep on HCC was elucidated by systems pharmacology and molecular docking. The results showed that Ep could significantly ameliorate HCC-induced tumor growth and migration in vivo and in vitro. System pharmacology results indicated that 180 genes associated with HCC were regarded as the potential therapeutic targets of Ep, mainly involved in metabolic pathways, cancer pathways, proteoglycans in cancer and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which might be a crucial pathway in HCC EMT. A herb-component-target-pathway network was constructed to reveal the interactions between Ep and HCC. Finally, predicted PI3K/Akt pathway was further validated by molecular docking and western blot experiment. This study showed that Ep ameliorates HCC-induced tumor cell survival and migration in mice via the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, Ep might be a potential new strategy to prevent the growth and metastasis of HCC.

Abstract: The significant diurnal temperature variation has become a severe challenge restricting comfortable human survival in the summer desert. Thermochemical heat and cold control technology, which owns the characteristics of large thermal energy storage/release capacity and excellent heat-cold combined storage/supply performance, makes an attractive method to solve the challenge. Herein, we propose a thermochemical heat and cold control strategy based on the working pair of manganese chloride@expanded natural graphite treated with sulfuric acid/ammonia (MnCl2@ENG-TSA/NH3) for reducing diurnal temperature variation in the summer desert. The system converts the thermal energy into chemical energy for storage by efficiently harvesting solar energy during the daytime, while the chemical energy transforms into thermal energy and cooling capacity for heating supply and refrigeration at night. The effective thermal energy charge in the daytime and thermal energy discharge at night are about 3011.48 and 1411.60 kJ with the oil temperature of solar collector and heating supply temperature of 175 °C and 40 °C as well as the ambient temperature of 30 °C and 10 °C. Moreover, the thermal energy charge density, thermal energy release density, and thermal storage efficiency of the system are as high as 941.09 kJ kg−1, 450.49 kJ kg−1, and 47.87%. Additionally, the system's effective cooling capacity, specific cooling capacity, and coefficient of performance (COP) are approximately 965.40 kJ, 301.68 kJ kg−1, and 0.383. The control system possesses strong heating supply ability and refrigeration ability because the temperature difference of heating supply and refrigeration can reach up to 16.99 °C and 3.03 °C at night, respectively. Therefore, this strategy can significantly improve indoor thermal comfort and reduce building energy consumption in the desert, having potential promotion value for efficient recovery and medium-low temperature thermal energy across time and space.

Abstract: Low-bandgap GaInNAsSb single junction solar cells incorporating a planar Au back surface reflector for enhancing the photocurrent generation are reported. In particular, a 700 nm thick GaInNAsSb junction with a bandgap of 0.78 eV (corresponding to 6.2% N) incorporating the back reflector exhibited a short-circuit current density of 15.2 mA/cm2 for AM1.5D (1000 W/m2) illumination, when placed underneath a GaAs-filter mimicking the operation of a multijunction architecture. The corresponding external quantum efficiency represents the highest external quantum efficiency reported so far for dilute nitride solar cells with bandgaps below 0.8 eV. Electrical simulations reveal that the relatively high value of the quantum efficiency is attributed to a low p-type carrier concentration and partially to the varying doping level in the GaInNAsSb region. Moreover, the absorption coefficients for low-bandgap GaInNAsSb materials are estimated and used in a comprehensive optical analysis to understand the photon harvesting performance of the solar cells with reflector. The analysis reveals incomplete absorption in the GaInNAsSb layers for the double-pass configuration enabled by the planar back reflector pointing to the need for deploying more advanced structured reflectors. However, the structures exhibited high collection efficiencies laying the foundation for further improvements of the quantum efficiency values. Moreover, the low-bandgap dilute nitride solar cells show potential to meet the current-matching requirements in next-generation multijunction devices with five or more junctions, thus being a prospective alternative for replacing Ge as the bottom junction.

Abstract: The thermal performance of a solar pond is affected by the amount of heat lost to the ground through the lower convective zone (LCZ) in which the heat is stored. Studies are focused on decreasing the heat losses, to maximize the energy stored and guarantee the stability of the thermohaline system over time. Phase change materials (PCMs) can help to achieve all these goals, since they work as thermal energy storage (TES), exploiting the latent heat absorbed during the solid-liquid phase change. This paper presents an experimental application of PCMs in the LCZ of a small solar pond. The paraffin wax was enclosed in aluminium cylinders which have been arranged on the bottom. The temperature of the solution in deep is monitored both with and without the PCM. The stability of the pond is analyzed through a laser shadowgraph technique, to visualize the effect of the thermal convection on the interfaces. Results show that the LCZ of the solar pond with PCM is around 3 °C colder than the reference case after a 6-h heating period. The shadowgraph analysis proves that the thermal convection in the reference case is stronger and damage the interface until break. The monitoring of the solar pond with PCM shows an improved stability.

Abstract: Illuminated solar cells are susceptible to various degradation mechanisms that can act to reduce the total energy yield when deployed. One potentially severe form is an increase in carrier recombination in the surface regions. This effect has been reported at both the undoped rear surface and phosphorous diffused emitter of PERC solar cells. This work investigates the influence of a range of surface conditions on the surface-related degradation (SRD) behaviour in PERC solar cells. It is shown that SRD is strongly affected by the doping profile of phosphorous emitters, the use of thin thermal oxides with SiNx:H dielectric passivation layers, the substrate material, and the configuration of the rear surface passivation. It finds that more lightly doped emitters result in more front side SRD, with its extent increasing with the introduction of the SiO2/SiNx:H surface passivation layers. Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) wafers were observed to be significantly more susceptible to surface degradation than multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, which we attribute to less trapping of hydrogen in the bulk of those substrates. On the rear side of PERC cells, surface degradation was only observed in structures that incorporated the combination of SiO2/SiNx:H rear layers. No SRD was observed in the existing Al2O3/SiNx:H technology used in the industrial PERC cells studied. However, the results presented have implications for future commercial solar cell technologies, which are transitioning towards lightly doped emitters and commonly incorporate thermal oxides for surface passivation.

Abstract: Daytime radiative cooling (DRC) technology is used for cooling by reflecting sunlight and radiating the heat to outer space. It does not require energy for cooling, and there is no pollution. In this study, a double-layer DRC structure was prepared using the doctor's blade method. The upper layer was a fluorocarbon resin (FEVE), while the bottom layer was a silver layer. The average reflectivity in the solar radiation band and the average emissivity in the atmospheric window were 0.933 and 0.945, respectively. Without considering non-radiative heat transfer, the cooling power was calculated as 128.75 W/m2 under direct sunlight and for the ambient temperature of 27 °C. When the material was used as a radiative cooler in Tianjin, China, the average temperature drop from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. was 5.1 °C. The proposed polymer cooler is cost-efficient, easy to fabricate and commercially feasible. In addition, its good weather resistance makes it possible for radiative coolers to be used outdoors for a long time, which will greatly promote the wider practical application of DRC.

Abstract: Incorporation of a third monovalent cation has been shown to improve the perovskite solar cell performance and stability. In this work, an in-depth study has been carried out to understand the effect of Cs+ and K+ cations on charge carrier dynamics in methylammonium-Formamidinium based solar cell. Different spectroscopic techniques together with electrical studies have been employed to determine the role of these cations on the charge carrier traps, charge transport, charge carrier extraction, recombination, etc. Incorporation of Cs+ leads to superior crystallinity and larger grains resulting in improved passivation, reduction of non-radiative losses and improved charge transport within the perovskite layer which resulted in improved cell performance than that with K+ incorporated device. The PL quenching at short-circuit, high recombination resistance deduced from the impedance spectra, lowest Urbach energy, and high electroluminescence of the Cs+ incorporated perovskite concur with the large and colunmnar grain growth with Cs+ incorporation. With Cs+, the device efficiency reach 19.8% with high fill factor of 80.28%, whereas K+ incorporated devices demonstrate only 16.16% efficiency with a fill factor of 71.76%. Although K+ substitution leads to better stability, MAFA:Cs+ devices are superior in terms of cell performance.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia significantly decreases 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent pathway activity in the kidney. A well-characterized downstream signaling effector of cGMP is cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), exerting a wide range of downstream effects, including vasodilation and vascular smooth muscle cells relaxation. In podocytes that are exposed to high glucose concentrations, crosstalk between the protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) decreased, attenuating insulin responsiveness and impairing podocyte function. The present study examined the effect of enhancing cGMP-dependent pathway activity on SIRT1-AMPK crosstalk in podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions. We found that enhancing cGMP-dependent pathway activity using a cGMP analog was associated with increases in SIRT1 protein levels and activity, with a concomitant increase in the degree of AMPK phosphorylation. The beneficial effects of enhancing cGMP-dependent pathway activity on SIRT1-AMPK crosstalk also included improvements in podocyte function. Based on our findings, we postulate an important role for SIRT1-AMPK crosstalk in the regulation of albumin permeability in hyperglycemia that is strongly associated with activity of the cGMP-dependent pathway.

Abstract: Composite phase change materials (CPCM) composed of 1-hexadecanol (HD), high density polyethylene (HDPE) and graphene nanoplates (GNP) were synthesized in this work. HD served as phase change material, while HDPE acted as support frame. GNP was introduced to improve thermal conductivity. A number of tests were conducted to acquire physical performances of the CPCM. The chemical components of the materials were obtained from Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT-IR). The crystal structure was illustrated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The microcosmic pattern was observed form scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Phase transition characters were analyzed from the data of differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Thermal stability was shown by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Thermal conductivity of CPCM3 was 1.86 times of HD/HDPE composites (PCM2). The GNP significantly enhanced the thermal conductivity. The latent heat and chemical structure were stable after the thermal cycling experiment. Hence, the CPCM3 is a reliable material in heat storage applications.

Abstract: We report the improved photocurrent induced by two-step photon absorption (TSPA) in the intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs) with a n-ZnS/ZnTe/ZnTeO/ZnTe/p-ZnTe structure using Cl-doped ZnTeO. In the IBSC with an undoped ZnTeO, the TSPA current is not observed at room temperature but it is significantly improved by using Cl-doped ZnTeO. Temperature and excitation intensity dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal the high activation energy of Cl-donor, and the observed activation temperature by PL measurements is consistent with the temperature where the TSPA current starts to increase. The temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage of the IBSC using Cl-doped ZnTeO also supports that the Cl doping in the ZnTeO layer introduces electrons into the intermediate band.

Abstract: Crosstalk within the gastric epithelium, which is closely in contact with stromal fibroblasts in the gastric mucosa, has a pivotal impact in proliferation, differentiation and transformation of the gastric epithelium. The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonises the gastric epithelium and represents a risk factor for gastric pathophysiology. Infection of H. pylori induces the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), which is involved in the pro-inflammatory response but also in cell survival. In co-cultures with human gastric fibroblasts (HGF), we found that apoptotic cell death is reduced in the polarised human gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87 or in gastric mucosoids during H. pylori infection. Interestingly, suppression of apoptotic cell death in NCI-N87 cells involved an enhanced A20 expression regulated by NF-κB activity in response to H. pylori infection. Moreover, A20 acts as an important negative regulator of caspase-8 activity, which was suppressed in NCI-N87 cells during co-culture with gastric fibroblasts. Our results provide evidence for NF-κB-dependent regulation of apoptotic cell death in cellular crosstalk and highlight the protective role of gastric fibroblasts in gastric epithelial cell death during H. pylori infection.

Abstract: Encapsulated phase-change materials (PCMs) have been widely studied in the field of solar thermal energy storage due to the advantages of stable shape and repeatability. In this work, a series of potatoes phase-change materials (PPMs) were conceived and synthesized via a common vacuum impregnation method, with biomass porous potatoes (PP) as substrate, polyethylene glycol (PEG) as phase change medium and MXene nanosheets as functional filler. The experimental results show that the introduction of MXene nanosheets not only significantly improve the photo-to-thermal conversion efficiency, but also help to increase the adsorption rate of PEG in PCMs. The PEG percentage of potatoes phase-change material (PPM) increases from 60.9% (PPM-0) to 82.1% (PPM-12.5), melting/freezing enthalpy values are also increases from 94.08 J/g/100.46 J/g of PPM-2.5 to 135.57 J/g/139.88 J/g of PPM-12.5, and its enthalpy efficiency λ and relative enthalpy efficiency η also increase from 57.6%/91.5% to 77.7%/98.3%. The results show that the prepared PPMs can be effectively applied to solar photo-to-thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The counter electrodes (CEs) as the basic components of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) mainly use Pt-based catalysts. It is still an urgent need to decrease the assembled cost of DSSCs by designing high-performance and low-cost Pt-free materials to replace the scarce and expensive Pt as CEs catalyst. How particularly striking are that specific precursors were prepared by ball-grinding with polyoxotungstate (H3PW12O40) as metal source and melamine (C3N3(NH2)3) as carbon source and nitrogen source, and then the pyrolysis process of precursors were dynamically controlled along the temperature gradient to make the auxiliary groups leave, so as to obtain the expected N-doped W2C catalytic materials. Herein, four kinds of N-doped W2C materials have derived from polyoxotungstate precursors at the pyrolysis temperatures of 700, 800, 900 and 1000 °C, and further applied to assemble CEs catalysts in DSSCs. The high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.10, 7.01, 5.95 and 5.34% were obtained for the regeneration of traditional iodide/triiodide (I3−/I−), respectively. The enhanced performance of N-doped W2C materials can be attributed to the larger number of catalytic active sites, which was due to the higher specific surface area provided by pyrolysis and carbonization of organic complex precursor, and the activation and modification of materials by the N-doped and the high temperature.

Abstract: State-of-the-art multifunctional form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs) with photo-thermal and electro-thermal dual responses have shown great application potential in sustainable energy utilization. The preparation of photo- and electric-responsive FSPCMs by mixing nano-functional materials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene with phase change materials (PCMs) systems has been extensively studied. Herein, photo and electric dual-responsive nanocapsules (IPW@CLPS@PPy) were designed and constructed by employing industrial paraffin wax (IPW) as the core PCMs, crosslinked polystyrene (CLPS) as the supporting inlayer via miniemulsion polymerization, and polypyrrole (PPy) as the dual functional outlayer via further fast-oxidative chemical polymerization. The resultant IPW@CLPS@PPy exhibits good shape stability, ideal phase change enthalpy (114.2 J/g), excellent thermal stability, and cyclability. Furthermore, the PPy functional outlayer endows IPW@CLPS@PPy nanocapsules with excellent solar light absorption capacity and electrical conductivity, resulting in ideal photo-thermal conversion efficiency (88.4%) and electro-thermal conversion efficiency (80.1%). Consequently, the synthesized IPW@CLPS@PPy has broad application prospects in photo-thermal and electro-thermal conversion/storage fields. This study will not only provide new ideas for the design and synthesis of nanostructured multifunctional FSPCMs but also open up routes towards the development of FSPCMs for energy harvesting, conversion, and storage fields.

Abstract: Ultra-thin Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) is a promising absorber for thin-film solar cells, as it combines the advantages of low raw material consumption and high conversion efficiency. In addition, ultra-thin absorbers on transparent back contacts bring the advantage of semitransparency, which is essential for e.g. tandem or bifacial solar cells. This work optimizes ultra-thin CIGSe on In2O3:Sn (ITO) for application in bifacial semi-transparent ultra-thin (BSTUT) CIGSe solar cells. Firstly, 100–400 nm ITO were coated onto glass substrates, and it was revealed that the thickness of ITO influences its optical bandgap Eg due to the Burstein-Moss (B-M) shift. The band gap of 400 nm ITO increased by 0.14 eV compared to the 100 nm thick ITO, and the Voc of the related BSTUT CIGSe solar cells raised by 0.043 V as a result of the diminished Schottky barrier Φb at the ITO/CIGSe interface. Secondly, 0–8 mg of NaF used for post deposition treatment (PDT) of the CIGSe were applied to the BSTUT solar cells. Compared to the reference without NaF, 8 mg NaF PDT enhanced the carrier density NA from 2 × 1015cm−3 to 1.2 × 1016cm−3 and diminished the ITO/CIGSe Schottky barrier Φb by 0.21 eV. In conclusion, we found that NaF PDT can tune the carrier density of ultra-thin CIGSe on ITO, and both thicker ITO and higher NaF PDT dose can reduce the ITO/CIGSe Schottky barrier. These discoveries enable future optimization of BSTUT CIGSe solar cells.

Abstract: Photovoltaic performance can be efficiently enhanced by improving the transmittance of solar cell cover, but the heating from unavailable solar irradiation has significantly adverse impact on both efficiency and reliability of solar cells. Radiative cooling can passively dissipate heat to the cold space (∼3 K) through the atmospheric window (8–13 μm). In this work, we reported a high-performance and scalable radiative cooler for solar cells using nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). More specifically, the fabricated AAO cooler exhibited a near-unity infrared (IR) emissivity of ∼0.97 (weighted with the IR emission intensity of 298 K blackbody) in the atmosphere window, while maintaining an excellent solar transmittance over 0.94. Moreover, radiative cooling experiments showed that the porous cooler can cool bare silicon wafer by ∼7.5 K under a solar irradiation of ∼850 W/m2 in humid areas (humidity ∼70%). More importantly, concentrating the solar irradiation of ∼554 W/m2 with 50 times Fresnel lens, the cooler can achieve a maximum temperature drop of ∼35.6 K without wind cover even in a cloudy day. To further reveal the practicality of proposed AAO cooler, performance modeling of single-junction crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell encapsulated with the AAO cooler has been developed. Compared with commercial solar cells, the improved annual output electricity of the solar cell with AAO cooler can reach ∼16.5 kW h/(a∙m2).

Abstract: We investigated oxygen passivation at the interfacial silicon surface on the highly phosphorus-doped region by oxygen ion implantation and showed resulting enhanced electrical properties of silicon solar cells. The oxygen ion implantation converts the dead layer formed due to crystallographic defects in the doping process into an oxygen-induced insulation layer by fragmentation with an optimal amount of energy. The surface dead layer of the highly doped Si emitter was broken by oxygen ions with a fixed-dose and different energies. The optimized implanted oxygen ion energy shows an improved short circuit current after implantation and improved efficiency with enhanced quantum efficiency in the blue region. On the other hand, high energy implanted oxygen ions formed surface defects, resulting in decreased cell efficiency.

Abstract: Back-contact design for the architecture of devices is a promising approach to develop high-performance perovskite solar cells. Here, numerical simulation methods are used to investigate device properties of back-contact perovskite solar cells (BC–PSCs) with the quasi-interdigitated, flat-interdigitated, and interdigitated electrode designs. The results highlight the principal differences in the designs of the electrodes and provide an investigation and analysis of the impact of these electrodes on the photovoltaic properties of their BC-PSCs. The effect of the perovskite photoactive layer electronic properties on the performance of BC-PSCs is also investigated. It is revealed that while BC-PSCs with the quasi-interdigitated electrode design can potentially produce power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) well above 25 %, BC-PSCs with the flat-interdigitated and interdigitated electrode designs are more tolerant to electronic imperfections in the perovskite layer and can produce PCEs higher than those in devices with the quasi-interdigitated electrode design. Manufacturing and prospective use of electrodes with the quasi-interdigitated, flat-interdigitated, and interdigitated designs in developing BC-PSCs are discussed from the experimental standpoint.

Abstract: Bistable electrochromic (EC) display with long EC memory has been a much-anticipated goal owing to its zero-energy consumption when maintaining the colored or bleached state when used in smart windows. However, it is very challenging to engineer the structure of the materials to accomplish a long EC memory along with high optical contrast, durability, switching fastness, and coloration efficiency which are of significance for fabricating the electrochromic devices with essentially power efficiency. Herein, we have judiciously incorporated the charge trapping MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) to prepare an electrochromic nanocomposite (polyFe-QD-10) of an Fe2+-based metallo-supramolecular EC polymer (polyFe) for the targeted enhancement of EC memory than the pristine polyFe polymer. The polyFe-QD-10 based electrochromic device (ECD) exhibits more cycle durability as it produced no loss in ΔT after the measurement of 100 cycle, while pristine polyFe-based ECD produced 14% loss in similar 100 cycle. The prototype ECD with polyFe-QD-10 film is also demonstrated with fast switching time (3.3 s for bleaching and 0.78 s for coloring), and good coloration efficiency (242.2 cm2 C−1). Remarkably, the ECD based on polyFe-QD-10 composite displays higher EC memory in open circuit condition as it takes 32 min for 90% reappearance of the original purple color after complete bleaching, while the pristine polyFe based ECD regains 90% of the transmittance of the color state only in 15 min. The strategy reported here presents the polyFe-MoS2 QD composite thin film an encouraging candidate for developing power efficient electrochromic information displays and smart windows.

Abstract: In concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, high temperature corrosion is a key issue for material selection. In this context, a homogeneous and crack-free FeAl coating with high Al content was prepared by using cold spray (combined with a post heat treatment) to improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316 L (SS316L) in molten carbonate salt for CSP applications. A series of immersion corrosion tests were performed to explore the corrosion behavior of the prepared aluminide coating in the LiNaK molten carbonate salt at 700 °C. The results demonstrated that the corrosion resistance of SS316L in the molten carbonate salt can be greatly improved by the prepared aluminide coating. This is attributed to the formation of a continuous dense LiAlO2 layer on the surface of the coating during corrosion. Although an α-LiAlO2 → γ-LiAlO2 phase transformation occurred during corrosion, it showed little influence on the corrosion performance of the prepared coating under the present experimental conditions. Furthermore, the coating remained intact even after 1000 h of corrosion. It is envisaged that the prepared coating has broad application prospects for CSP system with molten carbonate salt medium.

Abstract: Latent thermal energy storage is a novel technology based on phase change materials (PCMs) for storing and transporting energy. Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) has a large latent heat, but its application is severely restricted by supercooling and phase separation. In this study, a high-performance composite PCM (SAT/SiC/EG) containing SAT (as the PCM matrix), silicon carbide nanoparticles (SiC; as a nucleating agent), and expanded graphite (EG; as a supporting material) were synthesized by stirring and ultrasonic dispersion to ameliorate supercooling and phase separation. The maximum supercooling degree of the composite PCM with 2 wt% SiC and 2 wt% EG was 1.1 °C after 200 heat storage and release cycles. Interestingly, the introduction of EG significantly inhibited the phase separation of SAT, and the composite PCM exhibited excellent dispersion stability after 200 cycles. The addition of 2 wt% and 3 wt% EG significantly improved the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM by 1.09- and 1.77-fold, respectively, as compared to that of SAT. Additionally, the prepared composite PCMs exhibited a large latent heat capacity and a good thermal cycling performance, where the melting and freezing enthalpies of SAT/SiC/EG containing 96 wt% SAT, 2 wt% SiC, and 2 wt% EG was 252.1 J/g and 222.1 J/g, respectively. This study demonstrates that the SAT/SiC/EG composite PCMs have extensive application prospects in middle-low temperature solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Silicon/organic hybrid solar cells, with relatively simple and low-energy consumption fabrication processes, hold the promise for over-all cost reduction. However, their performances are still not comparable to the commercial crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. Here, hybrid devices with organic phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer inserted between metal electrode and textured p-type crystalline silicon (c-Si(p)) substrate are investigated. The quality of the PCBM/c-Si(p) contact is much improved after a SiOx thin layer is formed on the a-Si:H(i) surface and a Voc of 706 mV and an efficiency of 20.0% are achieved on the hybrid solar cells. Analysis of the dark J-V-T characteristics of the hybrid device shows that the junction current is dominated by the minority-carrier diffusion current.

Abstract: Numerous Golgi-resident enzymes implicated in glycosylation are regulated by the conserved intramembrane protease SPPL3. SPPL3-catalyzed endoproteolysis separates Golgi enzymes from their membrane anchors, enabling subsequent release from the Golgi and secretion. Experimentally altered SPPL3 expression changes glycosylation patterns, yet the regulation of SPPL3-mediated Golgi enzyme cleavage is not understood and conflicting results regarding the subcellular localization of SPPL3 have been reported. Here, we used precise genome editing to generate isogenic cell lines expressing N- or C-terminally tagged SPPL3 from its endogenous locus. Using these cells, we conducted co-localization analyses of tagged endogenous SPPL3 and Golgi markers under steady-state conditions and upon treatment with drugs disrupting Golgi organization. Our data demonstrate that endogenous SPPL3 is Golgi-resident and found predominantly in the mid-Golgi. We find that endogenous SPPL3 co-localizes with its substrates but similarly with non-substrate type II proteins, demonstrating that in addition to co-localization in the Golgi other substrate-intrinsic properties govern SPPL3-mediated intramembrane proteolysis. Given the prevalence of SPPL3-mediated cleavage among Golgi-resident proteins our results have important implications for the regulation of SPPL3 and its role in the organization of the Golgi glycosylation machinery.

Abstract: The hybrid nanofluids were used as absorber fluids in solar energy applications, which could further increase the efficiency of solar devices. The use of nanofluids in solar devices with the laminar and turbulent flow has received much attention. Presently, the effect of temperature and concentration on thermal conductivity and viscosity of fly ash-copper (80:20% by volume) hybrid nanofluid is investigated. The thermal conductivity and viscosity measurements were carried in the temperature range of 30–60 °C for a concentration range of 0–4.0 vol%. The nanoparticles and nanofluids were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM, TEM, zeta potential, and DLS techniques. The maximum augmentation in the hybrid nanofluid's dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity at a concentration of 4 vol% is 45.18% and 49.8%, respectively, at 30 and 60 °C. Correlations to estimate the hybrid nanofluid's dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity have been proposed considering the results obtained from the present study. A radial basis function-based neural network is used to model nanofluids' effective thermal conductivity and relative viscosity. The outcomes of the experiments were used to calculate the Mouromtseff number and heat transfer efficiency for solar energy applications.

Abstract: High-power laser transmission (HPLT) is attracting a huge interest from both the scientific and industrial community due to its large number of potential applications and future perspectives. This technology consists of the use of a monochromatic light source to power supply a remote system by using a photovoltaic converter. HPLT offers a technological paradigm shift with the possibility of transmitting kilowatts to several kilometres without the use of wires. However, HPLT is still under development and the current efficiency, ≈20%, needs to be improved to achieve the actual potential of the technology. This work is focused on the investigation of the most suitable materials to improve the performance of HPLT systems under a wide range of scenarios. For the first time, the monochromatic efficiency of PV converters, considering the attenuation of the atmosphere with the distance, and for various input light intensities and series resistance scenarios, is deeply investigated. The results indicate that high energy gap materials such as ZnS (3.54 eV) or 6H–SiC (3 eV) could lead to record efficiencies and improve current values in more than 30%.

Abstract: Erythritol, having a nominal melting point of ∼118 °C, has been considered a candidate phase change material (PCM) for medium-temperature thermal energy storage (TES) due to its large latent heat of fusion (∼330 kJ/kg). However, it suffers from severe supercooling effect, up to several tens of degrees Celsius, upon crystallization by cooling, which remains to be a critical issue for its application. Here we propose a novel method of injection of gas bubbles into subcooled liquid erythritol to facilitate the nucleation of erythritol crystals, so as to reduce its degree of supercooling. Using this method, we obtained successfully an unprecedented reduction of the degree of supercooling of erythritol down to only 5 °C, which is much lower than those achieved by other conventional methods like adding a nucleating agent or ultrasonication. As a bonus, the latent heat of crystallization was found to be greatly increased by nearly 50%, from 218.2 kJ/kg to 322.3 kJ/kg. The injection of bubbles also enables an effective way for actively triggering the crystallization of erythritol in a controllable manner. Our results showed that by changing the injecting timing of bubbles, crystallization can always be triggered immediately with only the crystallization point being varied over a wide range. The injection of bubbles is thus deemed to be a highly-efficient, cost-effective, and scalable method for addressing the supercooling issue of erythritol, and other similar PCMs with deep supercooling, making it more promising for TES applications.

Abstract: In order to further improve the quality of high efficiency multicrystalline silicon and the performance of multicrystalline silicon solar cells, we designed a compact nucleation layer on the crucible bottom for casting high performance multicrystalline silicon ingots. The morphology of nucleation grains, the minority carrier lifetime mappings and the defects were analyzed and compared with that of the conventional nucleation layer. The results show that the initial nucleation grains of the compact nucleation layer were finer and more uniform, and there are fewer grains with high defect density at the ingot bottom，which is beneficial to reduce the defect ratio of the whole ingot. Moreover, the solar cell efficiency and electrical performance parameters, such as Rsh was also discussed. It was found that the Rsh has a great impact on the efficiency of multi-busbars solar cells, and the average solar cell conversion efficiency of the wafers grown with the compact nucleation layer is 0.11% higher than that of the wafers grown with the conventional nucleation layer.

Abstract: A novel method for fabricating the base metal Cu in an air atmosphere was successfully developed based on thick film screen printing of Al pastes and galvanic replacement reactions. The first thick film screen printed Cu electrode with high conductivity (<10−6 Ω-cm), which is comparable to thick film Ag electrode, was successfully made in air firing instead of reducing atmosphere firing. In this study, a high-efficiency p-type bifacial PERC solar cells with an industrial typical PERC process flow is introduced, used to apply a screen-printed aluminum finger grid on the rear side of an electrode, instead of a full-area aluminum layer. A novel copper (Cu) technique is used to fabricate the rear Cu electrodes that are substituted for rear Al electrodes in p-type PERC c-Si solar cells. The F.F. and efficiency of the p-PERT solar cell with the novel rear copper electrode can be remarkably improved by this method. The maximum efficiency of the p-type bifacial single crystalline solar cells obtained with this process was 22% for the front Ag side and 19.7% for the rear Cu side illumination under standard testing conditions (STC). The ratio between front and rear side performance was over 89% for all of the solar cells.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of firing treatments on n-type silicon samples passivated by ex-situ phosphorus-doped polysilicon (poly-Si)/SiOx structures, and identify factors affecting the firing response. Our samples show stable surface passivation upon firing at temperatures from 600 °C to 750 °C but exhibit a substantial increase in the recombination current density parameter J0 when the peak firing temperature reaches 800 °C. The extent of degradation is found to also be affected by various processing parameters, such as the means of oxide growth, the poly-Si deposition conditions, and the subsequent phosphorus diffusion. Particularly, the degradation extent appears to increase with poly-Si deposition temperature, possibly associated with changes in the crystal structure. Moreover, phosphorus diffusions performed at a lower temperature leads to stronger firing impact, which could be attributed to the lighter doping concentration in the poly-Si film. In addition, dielectric coatings show the most obvious influence on the firing behavior. Samples fired without the presence of dielectric capping layers suffered the most pronounced degradations in J0, whereas samples coated with SiNx/AlOx stacks or SiNx single layer with high refractive index above 2 exhibit minimum firing impact. It is speculated that hydrogen diffusion is responsible for the changes in surface passivation quality of the poly-Si/SiOx passivating contacts. The hypothesis explains the stronger firing impact on samples with lighter doping and lower crystallinity, which determines the diffusion of hydrogen upon firing and hence the amount of hydrogen present in the poly-Si/SiOx structure, and especially at the oxide interface.

Abstract: Large-area (251.96 cm2) bifacial interdigitated-back-contact (IBC) solar cells are presented in this work. We employ front floating emitter (FFE) to replace the front surface field (FSF) to simplify the process sequences. A simplified process flow is exploited to fabricate the IBC solar cells through industrial equipment and compatible processes. Double side boron diffusion followed by etch-back to form the emitter and lightly doped front surface, reducing high-temperature influence on the bulk lifetime and fabrication complexity. Ion implantation and anneal process is applied for base doping. The cell conversion efficiency reaches 22.92%, independently certificated by Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System CalLab (Fraunhofer ISE). The IBC solar cells feature an open metallization grid, which offers a bifacial response with the bifaciality reaches to 72%. Only one-step mask and opening procedure was used, which greatly simplified the process. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this simplified process for manufacturing low-cost high-efficiency of IBC cells. Key parameters such as surface recombination J0, metal contact recombination J0-metal, contact resistivity of the cells are extracted by specially designed structures. Loss analysis shows that further efficiency improvement can be attained though reducing the contact resistance and metal contact recombination. The results in this work indicates the potential of this novel process for producing low-cost high-efficient IBC solar cells.

Abstract: Alveolar epithelial cell senescence is a core event in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Endoplasmic reticulum stress accelerates cellular senescence significantly; however, whether this stress promotes alveolar epithelial cell senescence in pulmonary fibrosis and its mechanisms are unclear. As a common intersection of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathways, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) activates the oxidative stress pathway, which in turn accelerates cellular senescence. Therefore, we speculated CHOP pathway activation would affect endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced alveolar epithelial cell senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we observed that alveolar epithelial cell senescence was accompanied by CHOP overexpression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissues. Bleomycin and tunicamycin combination models in vivo and in vitro showed that CHOP downregulation rescued alveolar epithelial cell senescence, reduced fibroblast activation mediated by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and improved pulmonary fibrosis pathology. Mechanistic studies showed that CHOP accelerated alveolar epithelial cell senescence by promoting reactive oxygen species generation, which activated the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. Our study suggested that CHOP activates the downstream nuclear factor-kappa B pathway, thus contributing to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced alveolar epithelial cell senescence and pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Diamond-wire sawing silicon waste (DSSW) from photovoltaic silicon wafer sawing process represents a resource worth recovery and recycling. In this contribution, in order to utilize DSSW with low cost and high value, composite Si nanostructures for photocatalytic H2 evolution were innovatively synthesized by a simple, one-pot metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method from DSSW. The morphologies, phase structure, elemental composition and optical properties of the composite were characterized by XPS, BET, XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and UV–vis. DRS, the photocatalytic performance was evaluated by water splitting under visible light. The results indicated that a visible light responsive Ag nanoparticles/porous silicon/silicon nanosheets (AgNP@PSi/SiNS) composite was obtained. Owing to the porous and nanosheets features, the specific surface area of the composite is as high as 377.968 m2 g−1 and quantum confinement effects is successfully triggered to broaden the band gap of silicon from 1.12 eV to 1.31 eV, which allows an excellent hydrogen evolution amount of 367.65 μmol g−1 in the initial 1 h. In addition, the effect of Ag amount on the morphologies and photocatalytic performance of the composite was investigated. This study presents a promising route for the fabrication of composite silicon nanostructured photocatalysts from industrial silicon waste for solar hydrogen generation, demonstrating the potential for waste recovery and energy conversion.

Abstract: The supraneural body, also known as dorsal fat body is considered from adipose progenitors, and possesses hematopoietic activity. However, in-depth knowledge of cell-type by single-cell transcriptome sequencing and physiological functions are still lacking. Here, we determined at least four types of cells, such as white adipocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and red blood cells by using 10 ×Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and histochemistry. Additionally, most immune cells contain scattered small fat droplets except for white adipocytes with one large lipid droplet. The content of triglyceride in supraneural body is the highest compared with other tissues. The mRNA expression of both lipolysis-related genes and brown adipocytes-specific marker genes were up-regulated in supraneural body cells in response to epinephrine. Taken together, these data indicate that the supraneural body may play an important role in immune and fat storage. Our findings not only provided detailed insights into the unique molecular make-up of the supraneural body tissue, but also shed new light on future analyses of physiological functions in immune or lipid regulating.

Abstract: In addition to native-state structures, biomolecules often form condensed supramolecular assemblies or cellular membraneless organelles that are critical for cell life. These biomolecular assemblies, generally including liquid-like droplets (condensates) and amyloid-like aggregates, can sequester or recruit their interacting partners, so as to either modulate various cellular behaviors or even cause disorders. This review article summarizes recent advances in the sequestration of native factors by biomolecular assemblies and discusses their potential consequences on cellular function, homeostasis, and disease pathology.

Abstract: Interactions between the gas atmosphere, liquid silicon, Si3N4 coating, and graphite are of great interest for photovoltaic silicon applications. However, previous studies focus more on the wetting of silicon on coated substrates rather than the coating stability and interaction with furnace atmosphere. Here we report on the coating deoxidation and the liquid silicon behavior at different compositions of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and argon. In-situ melting experiments were performed with solar grade silicon samples in various gas compositions. The results showed a rapid reaction between molten silicon and carbon monoxide that led to the formation of a silicon carbide layer at the liquid free surface. This layer retains the silicon droplet at the early stage of wetting and prevents silicon infiltration and spreading. Furthermore, CO gas prohibits the self-reduction of SiO2 in the coating and the reduction by graphite. On the other hand, nitrogen accelerates the wetting of silicon as it favors the formation of highly wetted silicon nitride compound at the triple line of the droplet. A slight increase in the decomposition rate of silica content in the coating was observed with the introduction of nitrogen to the furnace. The influence of the morphology and the growth of nitride and carbide layers on the wettability was elucidated in detail. The results were supported by Raman spectroscopy and thermodynamic calculations.

Abstract: This paper studies the enhanced heat transfer of adding longitudinal fins in a horizontal shell-and-tube heat storage unit. A two-dimensional numerical model is established and validated through comparing with experimental data in literature. Under the same ratio of fin volume to phase change materials (PCMs), the melting thermal performance is optimized by changing the fin thickness, interval and the number. Results demonstrate that adding longitudinal fins is a simple and effective method to enhance the thermal energy storage efficiency. The number of fins greatly affects the complete melting time, and the maximum time difference caused by the number of fins is as high as 72.85% under the same phase change material (PCM) filling mass. At the same time, increasing the number of fins will weaken the local natural convection. In this paper, the optimal number of fins in the limited research range is given, and the effectiveness of longitudinal fins in improving melting speed is quantified, which has certain practical significance for the engineering application research of phase change energy storage.

Abstract: Electrochromism has been demonstrated to be a promising technology for intelligent and energy saving light and/or thermal radiation management. However, the efficient operation of electrochromic devices under real world fickle working temperature caused by the seasonal and regional differences has been rarely addressed, which was of significance for the practical applications. The relatively deteriorative ionic conductivity and/or optical transparency of the electrolyte were identified as the main limiting factor. In this work, we reported an example of stable electrochromic device that can operate efficiently under wide working temperature from -40 oC to 60 oC, by employing thermal tolerant hydrogel electrolytes through composition engineering. The present optimized hydrogel electrolyte showed good anti-freezing ability and heat-resistance, and exhibited high ionic conductivity (>1.1 S m-1) among the wide working temperature (-40 oC–60 oC). Accordingly, the present electrochromic device exhibited fast response time (tb = 1.7s, tc = 2.9s), good coloration efficiency (252.67 cm2 C-1), good switching stability over 1000 cycles under a wide working temperature window (-40 oC ∼ 60 oC). This work reveals the promising potential of thermal tolerant hydrogel electrolytes for practical electrochromics devices under real world extreme working conditions.

Abstract: Organic small molecules are advantageous in electrochromism as they exhibit high coloration efficiency, fast switching with vivid colors range at low potential range. However, the main problems in this type of electrochromes are film processing and dissolution of the compound during operation to restrict the durability. Herein, we have successfully synthesized two water soluble sulfonate group containing arylene diimides; NDI-cored NTSA and PDI-cored PRSA and comprehensively characterized by different spectroscopic techniques, morphological investigation and electrochemical characterizations, etc. Two diffusion controlled quasi-reversible redox waves are envisaged in both the compounds for stepwise reduction of neutral species to mono-anion radical and mono-anion radical to di-anion radical formation. Both NTSA and PRSA films show multichromic EC behavior in low potential range of +0.5 to −1.5 V with high optical contrast and high coloration efficiencies when measured in solution electrolytes. The durability test unveils the 80% retention of the optical contrast for NTSA, while 82% retention of the same for PRSA even after 800 cycles. The solid state ECD made of PRSA film also divulges the similar multi-chromic EC behavior. The results can provide a viable approach to design the high performance cathodically colored PDI and NDI ECMs as the potential candidate for energy-saving multi-colored smart window.

Abstract: With renewables as the main candidate for future energy sources, efficient energy storage is considered a key to unlock its full potential. In this context, thermal energy storage (TES), particularly molten salt-based TES, is considered as an efficient, simple and a low-cost option. One of the main drawbacks for this technology is the corrosion of vessels storing the salt at elevated temperatures. Recently, the addition of nanoparticles has been reported to be able to mitigate the corrosivity of molten salts by several independent groups. However, no convincing explanation has been established so far as to why such behaviour takes place. In this work, we attempt to give a new insight into anticorrosion performance of molten salts dopped with nanoparticles (molten salts nanofluids) both experimentally and through Molecular Dynamic simulations. XPS-depth profiling, SEM-EDX and XRD experiments together with macroscopic and atomistic modelling were used in this work and the results suggest that the diffusion of nanoparticles into construction materials at high temperatures is one of the corrosion mitigation mechanisms of molten salts nanofluids. This new finding allows the explanation of some of the reported corrosion results and hence paves the way for a new anticorrosion strategy for molten salts and other high-temperature applications.

Abstract: The day-dependent photovoltaic performance of P3CT-Na based CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) solar cells can be improved by adding small molecules (urea, PCBM and C60) into the MAPbI3 crystal thin films to passivate the defects at the grain boundaries. The experimental results show that the passivation mechanism of the different additives does not only depend on the type of additives but also be related to the chemical interaction between additives and MAPbI3 crystals. Atomic-force microscopic images, day-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and temperature-dependent PL shows that the chemical bonds between C60 molecules and MA cations can be formed and thereby stabilizing the MAPbI3 crystal thin films. In other words, the stable and high-efficiency P3CT-Na based MAPbI3 solar cells can be realized when the surface defects of MAPbI3 crystal grains are passivated with the MA-C60-MA cations. Our results provide a way to increase the device stability of the solution-processed polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin film based solar cells.

Abstract: Aiming at improving the utilization efficiency of solar photothermal energy, this study focuses on a novel phase-change microcapsule system based on an n-docosane core and a carbon-nanotubes (CNTs)/polydopamine (PDA)/silica hierarchical shell. The system was fabricated by encapsulating n-docosane in a silica shell and then depositing a PDA layer on the shell surface, followed by conglutinating CNTs onto the PDA layer. The resultant microcapsule system shows a regular spherical morphology together with desired core-shell hierarchical microstructure and chemical compositions. The presence of CNTs/PDA coating layer can impart an efficient solar light-to-heat energy conversion capability to the microcapsule system through photon capture and sunlight absorption. The microcapsule system not only shows a good latent heat-storage capability with satisfactory phase-change enthalpies of over 130 J/g but also exhibits an optimal photothermal conversion efficiency of 90.1%. The microcapsule system also exhibits good leakage-prevention performance, high thermal cycle stability, excellent thermal impact resistance, and good shape/form stability to deal with a wide range of solar photothermal energy applications. Through integrating CNTs and PDA into a phase-change microcapsule system, this work provides a promising approach for the development of PCMs-based functional materials with enhanced solar light-to-heat energy conversion and storage performance for efficient utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: In this study, expanded graphite (EG)/paraffin (PA)/silica (SiO2) composite phase change materials (PCM), with good thermal conductivity and impermeability, were fabricated for potential applications in solar energy. The EG-PA was first prepared by vacuum adsorption and then encapsulated by SiO2 through solid-phase wet grinding in the presence of sodium silicate. Our results show that the EG-PA-SiO2 composite have optimal properties when the mass ratio of raw material is PA: sodium silicate: H2O = 1:9:2:8. The latent heat of melting of the EG-PA-SiO2 composite prepared at this mass ratio is 106.2 J/g. The core material loss ratio, after washing with petroleum ether, is 4.79%. The thermal conductivity is 2.053 W/m·K, which is 8.5 times higher than that of pure paraffin wax, and the melt permeability is 9.35% after 120 min at 60 °C. Under simulated sunlight, the time required for the composite material to change from 30 °C to 65 °C is reduced by 70.78% compared to PA and the heat absorption and release times are nearly unchanged under multiple cycles. These results indicate that the material has a stable photothermal conversion efficiency.

Abstract: The supported phase change of molten salt is a promising approach for thermal energy storage. Here we reveal a diffusion-controlled latent heat transportation by a controllable graphite induced anisotropic interface. It focus on salt crystallization processes across the interfaces during phase changing, and underling relationship between interfacial anisotropy and latent heat transport was understood: The anisotropic interface induced by graphite tends to compete with the driving force of crystallization in confinement, releasing the transport limitation for the latent heat. The sharp density gap with a large loading of graphite could not contribute to release the transport limitation but serves as a layer for driving the crystallization, leading to the failure of graphite anisotropic interface for diffusion control over latent heat. This work considered is the microscopic kinetics of salt crystallization and latent heat transfer in confinement, so clarification of the interdependences has far-reaching implications for understanding material design strategies.

Abstract: Characterisation and optimization of next-generation silicon solar cell concepts rely on an accurate knowledge of intrinsic charge carrier recombination in crystalline silicon. Reports of measured lifetimes exceeding the previous accepted parameterisation of intrinsic recombination indicate an overestimation of this recombination in certain injection regimes and hence the need for revision. In this work, twelve high-quality silicon sample sets covering a wide doping range are fabricated using state-of-the-art processing routes in order to permit an accurate assessment of intrinsic recombination based on wafer thickness variation. Special care is taken to mitigate extrinsic recombination due to bulk contamination or at the wafer surfaces. The combination of the high-quality samples with refined sample characterisation and lifetime measurements enables a much higher level of accuracy to be achieved compared to previous studies. We observe that reabsorption of luminescence photons inside the sample must be accounted for to achieve a precise description of radiative recombination. With this effect taken into account, we extract the lifetime limitation due to Auger recombination. We find that the extracted Auger recombination rate can accurately be parameterized using a physically motivated equation based on Coulomb-enhanced Auger recombination for all doping and injection conditions relevant for silicon-based photovoltaics. The improved accuracy of data description obtained with the model suggests that our new parameterisation is more consistent with the actual recombination process than previous models. Due to notable changes in Auger recombination predicted for moderate injection, we further revise the fundamental limiting power conversion efficiency for a single-junction crystalline silicon solar cell to 29.4%, which is within 0.1%abs compared to other recent assessments.

Abstract: To evaluate a new approach to Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS-IIIA), work was initiated on primary fibroblasts from a well-known mouse model in which sulfamidase deficiency correlates with the accumulation of heparan sulfate - the hallmark of this disease. Once the culture of fibroblasts was established, we observed continuous proliferation with a rapid growth rate, loss of contact inhibition and late passage stability, corresponding to a spontaneously immortalized cell line. The presence of the single point D31N mutation was verified and both rapid and abundant intracellular accumulation of low molecular weight HS was observed, confirming both genotype and phenotype. This cell line is a potential in vitro model system for future studies of MPS-IIIA prior to employing animal models.

Abstract: Reliability and durability tests play a key role in the photovoltaic (PV) industry by minimizing potential failure risks for both existing and new cell and module technologies. In this work, a detailed study of contact degradation in monocrystalline and multicrystalline PV modules is performed. The modules are subjected to a sequence of damp heat (DH) exposures followed by electrical characterization after each step. Electroluminescence (EL) imaging shows different darkening patterns for monocrystalline modules compared to multicrystalline modules; the former shows darkening near the busbars and the latter shows it across virtually the entire cell surface. The primary loss mechanism is confirmed to be resistive after comparing the current-voltage (I–V) characteristics at each DH exposure step. Representative samples have been cored out from both the degraded modules and controls for materials characterization to gain further insights into the degradation mechanism. Top-down and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and top-down high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis performed on the cored samples confirm the degradation is due to metallization corrosion. Our study suggests that the difference in the darkening pattern can most likely be attributed to the different silver paste composition used for contacting each cell technology, particularly the composition of the glass frit.

Abstract: Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) plays a crucial role in cell differentiation of different cell types. However, the involvement of PLD1 in astrocytic differentiation remains uncertain. In the present study, we investigate the possible role of PLD1 and its product phosphatidic acid (PA) in astrocytic differentiation of hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) from hippocampi of embryonic day 16.5 rat embryos. We showed that overexpression of PLD1 increased the expression level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, and the number of GFAP-positive cells. Knockdown of PLD1 by transfection with Pld1 shRNA inhibited astrocytic differentiation. Moreover, PLD1 deletion (Pld1−/−) suppressed the level of GFAP in the mouse hippocampus. These results indicate that PLD1 plays a crucial role in regulating astrocytic differentiation in hippocampal NSPCs. Interestingly, PA itself was sufficient to promote astrocytic differentiation. PA-induced GFAP expression was decreased by inhibition of signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) using siRNA. Furthermore, PA-induced STAT3 activation and astrocytic differentiation were regulated by the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/aurora kinase A (AURKA) pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that PLD1 is an important modulator of astrocytic differentiation in hippocampal NSPCs via the FAK/AURKA/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Silicon Heterojunction has become a promising technology to substitute passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) solar cells in pursuance of lower levelized cost of electricity through high efficiency devices. While high open circuit voltages and fill factors are reached, current loss related to the front and rear contacts, such as the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers is still a limiting factor to come closer to the efficiency limit of silicon based solar cells. Furthermore, reducing indium consumption for the TCO has become mandatory to push silicon heterojunction technology towards a terawatt scale production due to material scarcity and costs. To address these issues dielectric layers, such as silicon dioxide or nitride cappings are implemented to reduce TCO thicknesses both diminishing parasitic absorption and material consumption. However, reducing the TCO thickness comes in cost of resistive losses. Furthermore, the TCO properties do vary with thickness and neighboring layer configuration altering the optimization frame of the device. In this paper we present a detailed analysis to quantify the optoelectrical losses trade-off associated to the TCO thickness reduction in such layer stacks. Through the analysis we show and explain why experimental bifacial cells with 20 nm front and rear TCO perform at a similar level to reference cells with 75 nm under front and rear illumination reaching efficiency close to 24% at 92% bifaciality. We present as well a simple interconnection method via screen printing metallization to implement a thin TCO/silicon dioxide/silver reflector enhancing current density from 39.6 to 40.4 mA/cm2 without compromising resistive losses resulting in a 0.2% absolute solar cell efficiency increase from a bifacial design (23.5–23.7%). Finally, following this approach we present a certified champion cell with an efficiency of 24.6%.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of yearly energy yield of photovoltaic devices under realistic operating conditions is key for numerous practical applications related to further evolution of photovoltaics. In this work we present development and validation of an energy yield model applied to planar perovskite solar cells. The model is based on the combination of advanced optical modelling and extensive opto-electrical characterization and takes the geographical location and the orientation of the device into account. Using the model, we first perform a detailed sensitivity analysis and indicate the key parameters and their interdependencies that most significantly affect the calculated energy yield values. We show that the results are dominated (within 4% of the final value) by the solar irradiance dependency of the short-circuit current density, and further by the temperature dependency of the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor, whereas the irradiance dependency of the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor are mutually compensated. In the second part of the paper, we investigate how the energy yield of the device is affected by the application of external light management foils. Different texture morphologies, geographical locations, and device orientations are included in the investigation. The results show that even under realistic operating conditions, the overall trends of the light management efficiency of textured foils are not that different from those observed under standard test conditions; the highest energy yield gains in the order of 7–11% are obtained by the tetrahedral texture which is indicated as optimal in all studied cases.

Abstract: The mutant p53Y220C (mutp53Y220C) is frequently observed in numerous tumors, including pancreatic cancer. The mutation creates a crevice in the DNA binding core domain and makes p53 a thermally unstable non-functional protein that assists tumor progression and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoring mutp53 function to its wild type by selectively targeting this crevice with small molecules is a pivotal strategy to promote apoptosis. In this study, we have shown through different biophysical and cell-based studies that curcumin binds and rescues mutp53Y220C to an active wild-type conformation and restores its apoptotic transcription function in BxPC-3-pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the curcumin-rescued-p53Y220C (CRp53) showed significant hyperphosphorylation at Ser15, Ser20, and acetylation at Lys382 with an 8-fold increase in transcription activity in the BxPC-3 cell lines. We also observed that the active CRp53 escapes Mdm2-mediated proteasomal degradation and the majority of the proteins were localized inside the nucleus with an increased half-life and transcription restoration compared to untreated BxPC-3 cells. By label-free proteomics analysis, we observed that upon curcumin treatment almost 227 proteins were dysregulated with the majority of them being transcriptional targets of p53. Based on our studies, it reflects that apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by curcumin-rescued mutant p53Y220C.

Abstract: Background
The study aimed to analysis the genetic variation of the lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 SNPs, and explored the regulation of SNPs on the invasion and metastasis of Breast cancer (BC).
Methods
The SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) was screened for genotyping among 504 Chinese Han patients and 505 controls, which were frequency-matched for age ( ± 2 years). Logistic analysis was to explore the relationship between SNPs and the BC risk. Interactions between SNPs and reproductive factors was explored using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. qRT–PCR was conducted to detect the CDKN2B-AS1 expression in plasma of different rs10965215 and rs2518723 genotypes. The effect of rs10965215 A>G mutation on the binding ability of CDKN2B-AS1 and miR-4440 was verified by dual luciferase experiment. CCK-8, scratch and Transwell experiment were performed to explore the effect of miR-4440 over-expression on BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
Results
A total of 13 SNP was screened. The individuals with SNPs rs2518723C>T, rs10965215 A>G, rs77792598C>G, rs4977753 T > C, rs75917766C>T and rs78545330C>G mutations might increase the BC risk. MDR results revealed that individuals with rs10965215 G genotype who age at menarche≥ 13 and regardless of the number of abortion< 2 or ≥ 2 had a higher risk of BC. The relative expression of CDKN2B-AS1 in rs10965215 homozygous wild AA genotype (8.88 ± 3.43) was lower than heterozygous GA (11.08 ± 2.90) and homozygous mutant GG genotype (11.31 ± 2.90). When rs10965215 wild A genotype was carried, there was an interaction between CDKN2B-AS1 and miR-4440. The CCK-8, Transwell, and scratch experiment were all found that miR-4440 over-expression might enhance the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells. -
Conclusion
CDKN2B-AS1 gene polymorphism might be related to the susceptibility of BC, CDKN2B-AS1 rs10965215 A/G genotype probably affect the proliferation, invasion and migration of BC cells by modulating the interactions with of miR-4440.

Abstract: The light-induced degradation (LID) of solar module leads to severe loss in generated power due to the formation of recombination active defects. The silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells based on n-type wafers are less affected by the LID test. In this paper, the glass/back sheet structure (GBS) modules with different encapsulant materials (TPO, POE, EVA) were laminated to evaluate their performance changes under 2000 h light soaking stress for the first time. The current-voltage (light I–V, dark I–V) parameters of the modules were measured, as well as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and electroluminescence (EL), to verify the effect of light irradiation on SHJ solar modules. The SHJ modules with different encapsulant materials show excellent light-induced reliability. There is no degradation after 2000 h light irradiation, and even exhibits light-induced performance increase. The gain in output power (Pmax) is up to 1.41%, which is primarily due to an improved open-circuit Voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) as the result of a reduced density of recombination-active interface states. The front sheet/back sheet (FBS) modules also verified the accumulated light-induced stress could result in deteriorating interconnection between SHJ solar cell and ribbon, which suffers from significant output power degradation. The LID-free SHJ solar cells show great potential for lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of photovoltaic power generation.

Abstract: Mixed phase metal oxide photocatalysts at optimised phase ratio are known to perform better than their monophasic counterpart in visible spectrum. In tungsten oxide (WO3) too high visible activity is seen in multi-phasic systemhaving dominant hexagonal phase and is attributable to its superior photon harvesting characteristicsthan other phases. In a hetero-composite with ceria due to suitable band edge position further enhancement in the photoactivity is seen mainly with its monoclinic(m-WO3) phase. In this work, h-WO3/Ce3+/Ce4+based hetero-composites have been realized with different molar ratio of W/Ce.While h-WO3 dominates all the systems,m-WO3appears in the system at low concentration of Ce and disappears at higher concentrations. The resultant sharp increase (13.66X) in the visible photocatalytic performance of mixed phase-WO3/ceria composite compared to pristine h-WO3 shows a further jump (44X) in the monophasic-WO3/ceria composite with the highest concentration of ceria synthesized. The characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-VIS spectroscopy (UV-VIS DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transmission electronmicroscopy(TEM), and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) reveal the complex role distinct phase junctions of homo-/hetero-composites. The mixed-phase h-WO3/m-WO3homojunction, h-WO3/Ce3+ composite heterojunction and h-WO3/Ce3+/Ce2+ with both hetero-composite (h-WO3/Ce3+ and h-WO3/Ce2+) and homo-composite(Ce3+/Ce4+) heterojunction in the samples has been identified, and their roles have been analyzed to correlate with their respective visible light photoactivity.

Abstract: MDC1, a mediator of DNA damage response, recruits other repair proteins on double-strand break (DSB) sites. MDC1 is necessary for activating checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. It is unclear whether Chk1 interacts with MDC1. MDC1 also comprises many discrete domains. The role of the proline-serine-threonine (PST)-repeat domain of MDC1 in the DNA damage response is unclear. Here, we showed that MDC1 directly binds Chk1 through this PST-repeat region. Phosphorylation of Chk1 by ionizing radiation (IR) also required this PST-repeat domain. Degradation of intact MDC1 was accelerated depending on the PST-repeat domain after IR exposure. In the IR damage response, the PST-repeat-deleted MDC1 levels remained elevated with slow degradation. This abnormal regulation of MDC1 was F-box- and WD40 repeat-containing 7 (FBXW7)-dependent. The mutation of lysine 1413 within the PST-repeat of MDC1 deregulated MDC1 with or without damage. K1413R mutant and PST-deleted MDC1 displayed reduced ability to repair the damaged genome post-IR exposure. These results provide that the PST domain of MDC1 is involved in Chk1 and DNA repair activation. The findings suggest new insights into how MDC1 connects the checkpoint and DNA repair in the DNA damage response.

Abstract: In this work, we explored aluminium-induced crystallization (AIC) of amorphous Si (a-Si) as a low-temperature alternative to make p-type poly-Si/SiOx contacts for Si solar cells. In this approach, a stack of Al and a-Si deposited on a SiOx-passivated Si wafer surface is annealed at temperatures below 577 °C (the eutectic temperature of Al–Si mixture), which induces the exchange of Al and Si layer positions in the stack and the simultaneous crystallization of a-Si to Al-doped p-type poly-Si, potentially leading to the formation of an Al/poly-Si/SiOx passivating contact. The Al-doped AIC poly-Si has low carrier concentration, and thus to compensate for this, we used highly B-doped a-Si for AIC and could achieve a tenfold increase in the carrier concentration. We found that the typical thickness of 1.5 nm of the passivating SiOx layer is too low for this AIC-based approach, as Al reduces SiOx during the process and degrades its passivation quality. By starting with a thicker SiOx layer, we could demonstrate that AIC poly-Si/SiOx contacts with low contact recombination is achievable. However, the contact characteristic remains non-ohmic. This can be improved by extended annealing after AIC, during which Al diffuses into the Si substrate. The Al diffusion, however, damages the SiOx layer and in turn severely increases contact recombination. We conclude that with AIC poly-Si/SiOx contacts the process window to achieve low contact resistivity and low contact recombination seems to be very narrow, if existing at all.

Abstract: At present, the thermal properties (melting point, thermal conductivity, etc.) of common phase change materials (PCMs) cannot be accurately modulated, which limits their application in larger fields. Pseudo ionic liquid phase change materials (PILPCMs) have presented great potential due to its tunable thermal property and high physicochemical stability. In this work, a novel PILPCM consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and urea is developed for the solar water heating system (SWHS) for hot water supply. First, the mass ration of CTAB to urea was optimized toward suitable PILPCM with desirable phase change behaviors. The eutectic formation mechanism of PILPCM was then interpreted by experimental 13CNMR and theoretical σ-profile characteristics. Afterward, the shape stability, thermal conductivity, supercooling degree, thermal stability and reliability were investigated systematically. The results showed that the formation of eutectic PILPCM was ascribed to the physical hydrogen-bonds between CTAB and urea. The CTAB-urea mixture in the mass ratio of 6:1 exhibited favorable melting point of 86.9 °C, the highest latent of 174.9 kJ/kg, excellent shape stability, low degree supercooling of about 3 °C as well as comparable thermal conductivity. Moreover, such PILPCM had satisfactory thermal stability and reliability, which was confirmed by notably higher temperature of thermal decomposition over the operating condition and slight changes of phase change behaviors after 100 thermal cycles. Conclusively, the fabricated PILPCM integrates the advantages of CTAB and urea, and shows considerable potential in the concerned SWHS case.

Abstract: A novel and cost-effective method is employed to obviate conventional shortages of plate solar collectors by utilizing revolutionary tubes, microporous metal foam, and nanoparticles. In the new design, a thin metal foam is attached inside the tubes as a porous fin to increase the heat transfer area near the surface. Then, as the nanofluid passes through the tube, the rotation of the tube circulates the nanofluid and pushes it toward the porous fin by centrifugal force. This combined technique improves both convection and conduction mechanisms in the tubes and causes more thermal energy storage. Besides, the proposed method requires less pumping power because centrifugal force supplies part of the momentum for transport in the porous fin. Results reveal that 50.68% of the lost energy is managed and restored using the new method in the collector. In other words, 413 W more energy storage is achieved by the equipped solar collector compared to the simple one. Also, energy and exergy efficiencies rise by 22.8% and 8.5% in the manipulated system. Results confirm that the consuming power for pumping the nanofluid and rotating the tubes can be supplied by the system itself.

Abstract: Two-dimension covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are porous materials with the interlayer π-π interaction and excellent optoelectronic properties. Their adjustable porous structure and designable molecular structure endow them unlimited possibilities in the field of optoelectronic materials and other functional materials. In this paper, 2D COF electrochromic films were prepared by solvothermal synthesis method with different amounts of functionalized carbon nanotubes (FCNT) loading to improve their conductivity. The morphology characterization of COFDAAQ-TFP reveals its intertwined nanofiber structure. The electrochromic performance of COFDAAQ-TFP film shows that the color of COFDAAQ-TFP and FCNT-COFDAAQ-TFP have a reversible transformation from orange to dark brown during the redox process. When the loading amount of FCNT is 1%, FCNT-COFDAAQ-TFP exhibits best electrochromic properties, which has a contrast of 0.358 and coloring time of 5.7 s. Relative to COFs, FCNT-COF has enhanced contrast and stability, which is a potential electrochromic material in many fields such as smart window and smartphone back case.

Abstract: The next generations of Concentrated Solar Thermal Power (CSTP) systems use anhydrous salts as the heat transfer fluid and thermal storage medium. Unfortunately, a severe lack of experimental data is observed for the thermal transport properties of molten salt mixtures, generating constraints in exploring new potential materials for CSTP systems. The present paper presents a reliable theoretical framework for the prediction of both the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of multicomponent molten salts. As a case study, the thermal conductivity of the NaCl-KCl-MgCl2 system is predicted as a function of temperature and composition. This system is considered as a one of the most promising thermal storage medium of the next generation of CSTP systems. The temperature dependent thermal conductivity of pure MgCl2 is formulated based on atomistic simulations via classical and Ab initio equilibrium molecular dynamics. Thereafter, to assess the predictive capability of the proposed methodology, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of KCl-MgCl2 and NaCl-KCl-MgCl2 molten mixtures are predicted as a function of both temperature and composition and compared to the available experimental data and the present first principles simulations. A good agreement is achieved with both experimental and first principle data, indicating the robustness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive congenital neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency in the frataxin protein and is often diagnosed in young adulthood. An expansion of guanine-adenine-adenine repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene leads to decreased frataxin expression. Frataxin plays an essential role in mitochondrial metabolism. Most Friedreich ataxia patients are diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 60% of patients die with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the mitochondrial anatomy in Friedreich ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is still poorly understood. We investigated mitochondrial fission, fusion, and function using biochemical, microscopy, and computational stochastic analysis in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes from a patient with Friedreich ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a healthy individual. We found a significantly higher mitochondrial footprint, decreased mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein, and mitochondrial fission rate over fusion with more giant mitochondrial clusters in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes from a patient with Friedreich ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, compared to an unaffected individual. We also found significantly depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and higher reactive oxygen species levels in Friedreich ataxia human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes. Our results show that frataxin's depletion may dampen the mitochondrial fission machinery by reducing dynamin-related protein1. The loss of mitochondrial fission might lead to elevated reactive oxygen species and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, which may cause oxidative damage in Friedreich ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further investigations are needed to identify the mechanism of downregulating dynamin-related protein1 due to the frataxin deficiency in Friedreich ataxia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: We report the role of copper iodide (CuI) nanoparticles (NPs) as a hole transport layer (HTL) in cadmium sulfide/cadmium telluride (CdS/CdTe) photovoltaics. These CuI NPs were prepared using solution processing at room temperature and used to fabricate monofacial and bifacial CdTe solar cells with different back contacts. Using CuI/Au as the back contact, the device efficiency reached to 14.8% with outstanding fill factor (FF) of 79.2%. Replacing the gold (Au) electrode with sputtered transparent indium tin oxide (ITO), a CuI/ITO back contact yielded photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.6% and 5.5% under front and back illumination respectively. Bifacial devices (CdTe/ITO) without the CuI NP HTL have an efficiency of 7.0% and 1.0% for front and back illumination, respectively. For CuI/ITO, a current collection of 12.0 mAcm−2 was observed upon back illumination which significantly improved over an ITO-only back contact (5.0 mAcm−2). The PCE obtained from back illumination was enhanced when using CuI NPs as the HTL due to the reduced back barrier height, and improved back interface as determined by temperature dependent current vs. voltage characteristics and impedance spectroscopy analysis. The improvement in device performance of the bifacial configuration is a significant step forward toward realizing thin film photovoltaic modules which harvest energy incident on the rear of the module.

Abstract: Solar-driven interfacial steam generation for desalination has attracted broad attention. However, a significant challenge still remains for achieving a high evaporation rate and high water quality, together with an easy-to-manufacture device to provide a feasible solar-driven steam generation system. In this study, a novel ultrablack paint, Black 3.0, serving as a satisfactory photothermal material is sprayed into the hot-pressed melamine foam networks, allowing us to construct an ultrablack and self-floating evaporation device. The high performing features of effective solar absorption and salt-rejection capability contribute to a high evaporation rate of freshwater at 2.48 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun (1 kW m−2). This interfacial solar evaporator has a daily drinkable water yield of 2.8 kg m−2 even in cloudy winter weather and maintains stability in water with a wide range of acidity and alkalinity (pH 1 ∼ 14). All commercially available raw materials and scalable fabrication approaches offer us a feasible and affordable manner to enable the construction of a highly-efficient solar steam generation system for freshwater production.

Abstract: Upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG) silicon (Si) has raised interest as an alternative material for solar cells due to its low cost, low environmental impact and low CAPEX. Maximum cell efficiencies at the level of those obtained from high purity poly-Si have been reported. However, a higher defect density and the compensated doping character result in UMG-based cell efficiencies varying over wider ranges in frequency distribution charts. In this report we characterize mc-Si UMG samples with different defect densities, comparing them with monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) UMG and commercial high-performance multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) samples, analysing the impact of carrier trapping by means of photoconductance (PC) decay measurements, and its evolution after applying a phosphorous diffusion gettering (PDG) process. When analyzing the decay time constant of the PC measurements, slow (66.8 ± 14.3 ms) and fast (16.1 ± 3.5 ms) traps are found in mc-Si samples, while no evidence of trapping is found in mono-UMG samples. Slow traps are effectively removed after the PDG process, while fast traps do remain. The influence of dislocations clusters and the possible role of oxygen, as revealed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is discussed. Finally, the improvement in minority carrier lifetime due to the PDG treatment is reported for each sample type, reaching values up to 140 μs in mc-Si samples with neither slow traps nor interstitial oxygen FTIR-peaks.

Abstract: Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are expressed in the cells of the innate immune system and provide binding with pathogen and damage-associated molecular patterns with subsequent activation of the phagocytes for defense reactions such as chemotaxis, secretory degranulation and ROS generation. Probably, FPR2 is one of the unique receptors in the organism; it is able to recognize numerous ligands of different chemical structure, and moreover, these ligands can trigger opposite phagocyte responses promoting either pro- or anti-inflammatory reactions. Therefore, FPR2 and its signaling pathways are of intense research interest. We found only slight activation of ERK1/2 in the response to peptide ligand WKYMVM in the accelerating phase of ROS generation and more intense ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the declining phase of it in mouse bone marrow granulocytes. Lipid agonist BML-111 did not induce significant ERK phosphorylation when applied for 10–1800 s. To some extent co-localization of ERK1/2 and NADPH oxidase subunits was observed even in the intact cells and didn't change under FPR2 stimulation by WKYMVM, while direct PKC activation by PMA resulted to more efficient interaction between ERK1/2 and p47phox/p67phox and their translocation to plasma membrane. We have shown that phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 in bone marrow granulocytes depended on FPR2-triggered activity of PI3K and PKC, phosphatase DUSP6, and, the most but not the least, on ROS generation. Since blocking of ROS generation led to a slowdown of ERK activation indicating a significant contribution of ROS to the secondary regulation of ERK activity.

Abstract: Coatings are one of the promising techniques that can be applied to modify the surface properties and tailor the surface interactions with the surrounding. The development of conformable coatings for graphite materials can expand their use in silicon PV applications with no compromise on the silicon quality. However, no studies are focused on the coatings for graphite materials in silicon crystallization applications. Here we introduce different coating techniques that promise minimal interactions with the graphite and suppress the liquid silicon penetration. Five coating methods were proposed in this study: (i) one-layer coating: a mixture of silicon nitride and colloidal silica was directly coated on graphite substrates, (ii-iv) two-layer coating: a porous coating layer of silicon nitride, silicon carbide, or a combination of both materials was deposited as a protective layer below the top layer of Si3N4 and colloidal silica, and (v) a dense SiC layer was deposited on the graphite by silicon infiltration method below the top layer. The coatings’ wettability and interactions with graphite were investigated via in-situ melting experiments. The two-layer coating approach revealed a considerable improvement in the non-wetting behavior, a decrease in the coating degradation rate, and a decrease in CO evolution during the isothermal holding. The best non-wetting conditions with minimal detrimental interaction between graphite and silicon oxides were achieved by applying a two-layer coating with a thickness of 400 ± 50 μm and an initial oxygen concentration of 8 wt.% in the top layer. These findings can be utilized for the application of reusable graphite crucibles in silicon crystallization processes.

Abstract: Black silicon (b-Si) has been widely investigated as a potential replacement for more traditional antireflective schemes for silicon solar cells, such as random pyramids, due to its reduced broadband reflectance and improved light-trapping properties. Wavelength and angle resolved scattering (WARS) reflectance measurements provide the means of analysing the amount of light scattered from a textured surface, which can be of interest when considering the amount of light trapped through total internal reflectance (TIR) at various interfaces in an encapsulated photovoltaic module. Here we present and analyse results from WARS measurements on b-Si surfaces fabricated using metal assisted chemical etching (MACE). Large angle scattering is observed for the entire spectrum, increasingly so for shorter incident wavelengths and increasing height of texture features. This is predicted to result in 35–40% of the reflected light being trapped by TIR at the glass-air interface and redirected back onto the sample, when the sample is encapsulated in standard PV module materials. This leads to a calculated additional boost of up to 0.45% in the photogenerated current of an encapsulated black silicon solar cell. This exceeds the calculated 0.21% boost due to TIR predicted for an encapsulated solar cell employing the industry-standard random pyramid texture with a thin film antireflective coating.

Abstract: Solar cells based on GaAs often include a wide-bandgap semiconductor as a window layer to improve surface passivation. Such devices often have poor photon-to-electron conversion efficiency at higher photon energies due to parasitic absorption. In this article, we deposit FAPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots on the AlInP window layer of a GaAs thin-film solar cell to improve the external quantum efficiency (EQE) across its entire absorption range, resulting in an 18% relative enhancement of the short-circuit current density. Luminescent downshifting from the quantum dots to the GaAs device contributes to a large effective enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) at shorter wavelengths. Additionally, improved surface passivation of the window layer results in a 14–16% broadband increase of the IQE. These mechanisms combined with increased overall photon collection (antireflective effects) results in a doubling of the EQE in the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum. Our results show a promising application of perovskite nanocrystals to improve the performance of well-established thin-film solar cell technologies.

Abstract: Nickel oxide (NiO) is a well-known electrochromic (EC) material with anodic coloration. However, NiO degrades significantly upon cycling with Li+/H+-conducting electrolytes. Doping with various additives is the most effective method to enhance the cycling stability of NiO films. In this study, films of tantalum-doped nickel oxide, denoted as Ni1-xTax oxide, were deposited onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates by reactive DC magnetron co-sputtering from Ni and Ta metal targets for use as counter electrodes in monolithic inorganic EC devices (ECDs). The influence of the Ta content on the composition, structure, optical properties and EC properties of NiO was investigated. It was found that the microstructure of the Ni1-xTax oxide films was closely related to the EC performance and cycling stability. With moderate optical modulation, the cycling stability and optical transmittance of the Ni1-xTax oxide film with x = 0.274 were increased. All-solid-state inorganic ECDs were fabricated with the configuration ITO/WO3/Ta2O5/Ni1-xTax oxide/ITO/glass. The full ECDs showed different EC behaviors compared to those of the Ni1-xTax oxide single layers, which was attributed to the different counter electrode/ion conductor interfaces of the solid–solid and solid–liquid interfaces, respectively. The ECD fabricated with the Ni1-xTax oxide film with x = 0.065 showed stable transmittance modulation up to 1000 cycles. We propose a degradation mechanism for monolithic all-solid-state inorganic ECDs based on the observed degradation in the EC performance, which can pave the way for highly durable ECDs for various optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: As we all known, the problems of easy leakage, poor thermal conductivity and high flammability will hinder the application of phase change materials for energy storage. In this work, a novel multifunctional composite phase change material was prepared via efficient modifications, which has preeminent flame retardancy and shape stability to achieve safe and efficient storage of heat and light energy. As expected, the composite phase change material had excellent thermal energy storage density (163.9 J/g), even the melting enthalpy ratio could reach 91.1%. In comparison with pure PEG, the thermal conductivity has realized improvement as well, and the shape stability of composite phase change materials was significantly promoted, which could be heated at 80 °C for 1 h without the leakage of PEG. In addition, it showed excellent thermal stability and fire resistance, the maximum decomposition rate and the peak heat release rate were decreased by 47% and 34.1%, respectively, compared with pure PEG. More importantly, composite phase change materials realized the storage of light energy on the basis of thermal energy management and utilization, which could absorb and store ultraviolet and visible light during the day, and then release fluorescence slowly for a long time in the dark. To sum up, neoteric multifunctional composite phase change materials have enormous prospects for safe and efficient application in the fields of solar energy acquisition, thermal and light energy storage and thermal management.

Abstract: As the installation of PV power grid increases, it becomes vital to know the out-door reliability and degradation of the modules. In this study, more than 30 kW modules have been installed in Chinese Academy of Sciences-Shanghai Institute of Microsystem & Information Technology (SIMIT). The outdoor performance of seven different PV modules, i. e. HIT, CIGS, n-type multi-busbar module, PERC, and CdTe were measured from 2016 to 2018. The performance of all of the seven kinds of PV modules is excellent in March, April and May of 2018, owing to the relative low temperature and the intense irradiance. The daily and monthly PR of the PV modules displays distinct seasonal cyclic patterns. The PR calibrated to 25 °C (PRT = 25°C) is more consistent than the uncalibrated PR throughout the whole year. The comparison of the annual average uncalibrated PR is: bifacial HIT (1.0345)＞CIGS (1.0258)＞n-type multi-busbar module (0.9656)＞monofacial HIT (0.9648)＞sc-Si PERC (0.9591)＞mc-Si PERC (0.9346)＞CdTe (0.9067). Moreover, the power degradation after the installation more than 2 years is: mc-Si PERC (5.33%)＞n-type multi-busbar module (3.19%)＞sc-Si PERC (1.32%)＞monofacial HIT (0.25%). The property improvement of monofacial HIT and bifacial HIT after the light soaking was observed and the power increase of bifacial HIT is 0.72% in these two years, owing to the metastability of the amorphous—crystalline silicon heterointerface after the light soaking.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in construction energy consumption and indoor occupancy; this, in turn, has increased the demand for energy efficiency. Thermal energy storage is an effective method for energy saving and improving efficiency. In this study, improved shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) for enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings were manufactured and evaluated. These SSPCMs were prepared via the vacuum impregnation of n-octadecane into bentonite nanoclay. Bentonite exhibits a layered tetrahedral and octahedral crystal structure with Na+ cations (which feature high cation exchange capacity) in the interlayer space. The Na+ ion is a hydrophilic ion that affects the properties of the interlayer. However, paraffin-PCMs are hydrophobic and have poor compatibility with water. Therefore, hydrophobicity is induced in the organic nanoclay by using an organic modifier as the PCM container. Cloisite Na+, Cloisite 15, Cloisite 20, and Cloisite 93 were used to fabricate the SSPCMs. This study compares the amount of PCM impregnated depending on the compatibility of different PCMs between hydrophilic/hydrophobic nanoclays and also evaluates the thermal performance. The observed reduction in peak temperature and the time lag effect of the PCMs confirmed that the organically modified nanoclay and the PCM composites significantly improved the amount of PCM impregnated, thermal conductivity, and latent heat characteristics. The latent heat of the hydrophobic organic nanoclay was 209% higher than that of the SSPCM-based hydrophilic nanoclay.

Abstract: Solar heating (SH) and radiative cooling (RC) have been regarded as promising clean techniques for thermal energy harvesting and temperature control. However, SH and RC are only a single function of heat collection and dissipation, which means the static device of SH and RC cannot meet the dynamic heat requirement of real-world applications, especially in the daytime. Here, a strategy of dynamic integration of SH and RC is proposed for tunable thermal management. A device (i.e., SH/RC device) that includes a silica cavity, ultrapure single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous dispersion, solar reflective film, and deionized water is designed and fabricated. The outdoor experimental results show that the SH/RC device with SWCNTs media can effectively achieve heat collection with a maximum temperature of 78.9°C, while the SH/RC device with deionized water can achieve heat dissipation. Besides, the temperature modulation ability of the SH/RC device is tested to be 26.3°C and can be theoretically improved to be 60.3°C by improving the solar absorptivity (i.e., 0.9 for SH mode and 0.1 for RC mode) regulation ability of the device and improving its thermal emissivity (i.e., 0.9). Furthermore, annual analysis indicates that the cumulative time in which the SH/RC device temperature is in a comfortable region (i.e., 20°C-26°C) for humans is 60.9% and 30.3% higher than that of the device with individual SH and RC mode. In summary, this work provides alternative thinking for tunable thermal management based on the dynamic utilization of the hot sun and cold universe.

Abstract: As heat storage and heat transfer medium, molten salt plays a vital role in achieving high heat transfer efficiency in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. In this study, ternary chloride salts (NaCl–KCl–MgCl2) is considered as the base salt and the nanocomposites doped with different mass fractions of CuO are synthesized using the solution evaporation method. The thermophysical properties of the nanocomposites, including melting temperature, phase change enthalpy, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity are investigated. The experimental results indicated the melting temperature of the nanocomposites is very close to that of the base salt. The specific heat of the nanocomposite in the liquid phase region is 10.51% higher than that of the base salt when the mass fraction of CuO was 0.7%. The addition of CuO nanoparticles significantly increase the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the base salt. The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites are increased by 10.95–37.23% and 15.85–39.55% compared to the base salt, respectively. The nanocomposites doped with CuO nanoparticles exhibit good application prospects and excellent thermal energy storage performance for high-temperature CSP systems.

Abstract: One drawback of passivating contacts in crystalline silicon solar cells is the current loss due to parasitic absorption within the involved material layers. When employed on an illuminated side of the cell, the full spectrum of the incident light will be partly absorbed before reaching the silicon bulk. Additionally, near-infrared (NIR) absorption can substantially reduce the cell's NIR spectral response (SR) also when employed on the non-illuminated side. As those losses are hard to measure directly, optical modeling is crucial for their quantification. This paper presents an extension to an analytical light-trapping model to account for parasitic absorption in the near-surface region via a new parameter Appp (absorbed fraction per perpendicular pass). We test the model by analyzing i) reflectance measurements on samples with varying doping profiles, ii) SR measurements on TOPCon solar cells with varying back-side poly-silicon layers, and iii) SR measurements of a bifacial silicon heterojunction cell. We show that the model can well be calibrated by fitting a single value for Appp to reflectance measurements. This enables a quantification of the parasitic absorption loss without requiring knowledge of all layer's optical properties. The model also is able to predict parasitic absorption in TOPCon cells when knowing the thickness and doping density of the poly-Si layer. Having proven the usefulness of Appp to represent parasitic absorption as a single-valued quantity, we suggest Appp as a third figure of merit for the quality of a passivating contact, next to the recombination parameter J0c and the contact resistivity ρc.

Abstract: Applying compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) and phase change materials (PCMs) in photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems are effective methods to promote the electrical and thermal performance simultaneously. Much work has intensively investigated the performance enhancement of separate PV/T-CPC or PV/T-PCM system and conducted experiments under lab environment. However, there were few studies devoted to the thermal and electrical performance collaborative improvement especially at an actual outdoor environment. In this study, a compound parabolic concentrating PV/T system integrated with PCM (PV/T-CPCM) is constructed and different parameters are analyzed in an open-air environment. As solar irradiance and ambient temperature vary during the test period, PCM melts from solid to mushy state, and the temperature non-uniformity factor of PV modules/PCM drops from 4.28/1.34 to 1.42/0.66, indicating the PCM obviously improves the non-uniformity of temperature distribution. Set the pump state as OFF-ON-OFF, PV modules temperature firstly rises from 10.6 °C to 33.2 °C, then quickly drops down to 28.5 °C, and after that slowly drops down to 27.1 °C, showing the combination of PCM and liquid cooling is beneficial to further reduce the PV modules temperature. During the pump-on period, the instantaneous thermal, electrical and primary energy efficiency decrease from 19.6% to 5.0%, 4.8%–3.0%, 30.4%–16.8%, and the averaged values are 7.1%, 4.0% and 17.6%, respectively. The maximum primary energy efficiency of the PV/T-CPCM system is about 7.9% and 10.7% higher than that of the separate PV-CPC and PT-CPC system respectively, demonstrating that the PV/T-CPCM system owns superior heat-electricity cogeneration performance.

Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), known as the transition of tubular epithelial cells into fibroblasts, is one of the potential mechanisms of renal fibrosis, which promotes the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Etoposide-induced protein 2.4 (EI24) is known as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Bcl-2-binding transmembrane protein with various functions that can affect autophagy, apoptosis and differentiation. However, whether EI24 is involved in EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells and the exact mechanism is still not known. In this study, we first reported that EI24 expression was significantly downregulated in the kidneys of diabetic mice and in high glucose-stimulated HK2 cells. Knockdown of EI24 led to EMT of HK2 cells, as indicated by decreased E-cadherin and increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Meanwhile, overexpression of EI24 ameliorated high glucose-induced EMT of HK2 cells via activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Then, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) treatment enhanced EI24 expression and alleviated EMT in high glucose-treated HK2 cells and the kidneys of diabetic mice. Furthermore, DNMT1 and DNMT3a upregulation were found to be involved in the decrease of EI24 in high glucose-stimulated HK2 cells. Silencing of DNMT1 and DNMT3a effectively reversed high glucose-induced downregulation of EI24 and aggravation of EMT. Our findings demonstrate that the DNA methyltransferase-regulated EI24 affects EMT of renal tubular cells via AMPK signaling pathway. It is suggested that EI24 may be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic renal injury.

Abstract: Plating has long been recognized as a promising alternative to screen printing in commercial PV metallization due to its cost-saving and scaling-up potential. In this paper, we investigated the laser doping effects on plated contact formation. Critical parameters, such as laser power, focal position, and scanning speed, have been systematically analyzed by comparing their impacts on surface morphology, electrical properties, and plating results. Moreover, it was found the LD openings made by different laser resources would need different plating strategies. We have also successfully developed a baseline procedure integrating laser doping and hydrogenation passivation for bifacial plated PERC solar cells. Despite severe technical challenges in experimental conditions, up to 20.4% cell efficiency has been achieved, which evidentially demonstrates the commercial potential of plated contacts.

Abstract: Quantification of Auger recombination in crystalline silicon is usually challenging because it requires distinguishing Auger recombination from extrinsic recombination processes, especially at the surface. In this work we exploit the known injection dependence of surface recombination at surfaces passivated by highly charged dielectric films to assess the value of the ambipolar Auger coefficient Camb in crystalline silicon from carefully calibrated photoconductance decay measurements of high-lifetime Si wafers. A value of Camb = (2.11±0.02) × 10−30cm6s−1 is determined for both n- and p-type Si, independent of the dopant concentration for moderately doped samples near 300K. Furthermore, by exploiting the expected equality of the surface saturation current density J0s for identically processed n- and p-type substrates, we are able to estimate the relative contributions of ehh and eeh Auger processes to Camb under the same doping and injection regime. The resulting ratio Cn/Cp=2.81 is in close agreement with the value of 2.91 derived from the data of Dziewior and Schmid at high dopant concentrations, which we reassess in light of modern mobility models. Based on our own data and literature data at higher concentrations, we offer a revised parameterisation of the Auger recombination rate in c-Si as a function of dopant concentration and injection level which is consistent with these findings. This revised parameterisation is also shown to be consistent with the most recent record lifetimes reported by other authors. Finally, we suggest experimental considerations relevant for future efforts to further refine the Auger parameterisation.

EVI1 promotes metastasis by downregulating TIMP2 in metastatic colon and breast cancer cells,

Abstract: Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI1) is an oncogenic zinc finger transcription factor whose expression is frequently upregulated in a variety of cancers, including both myeloid malignancies and solid tumors. Previously, our group has shown that EVI1 knockdown minimizes the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells compared to that of control cells. In this study, to identify the potential targets that regulate cancer metastasis, control and EVI1 knockdown colon cancer cells were subjected to microarray. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) in EVI1 expressing cells. EVI1 knockdown increased TIMP2 protein expression levels and reduced wound healing and migration capacity in metastatic cells. Mechanistically, the TIMP2 promoter harbors potential binding sites for EVI1; EVI1 binds to TIMP2 promoter and represses its expression, as observed using ChIP and luciferase assay, respectively. TIMP2 is an important metastasis suppressor gene; however, its function is suppressed in many cancers through hypermethylation. Thus, demethylation could prove to be a potential alternative to reactivate TIMP2 functional activity. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which plays a vital role in maintaining the genome methylation pattern during DNA replication and repair, interacts with EVI1 to promote TIMP2 silencing. Treating cancer cells in vitro with a known demethylation agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Aza-D), restored the optimal TIMP2 expression without altering EVI1 binding efficiency and reduced relative wound healing potential of cancer cells. Animal studies showed that Aza-D treated cells injected through the intravenous route exhibited reduced liver and skin metastasis when compared to non-treated cells. Furthermore, Aza-D treatment in mice delayed the metastasis progression compared to the vehicle treated group. Thus, the present study provides an insight into the therapeutic applications of demethylating agents to reduce cancer metastasis in models with EVI1 overexpressing tumors.

Abstract: In this article, a method for phosphorous (n-type) doping of germanium based on spin-on dopant sources and Pulsed Laser Melting (PLM) throughout an amorphous silicon carbide (a-SixC1-x:H) layer, which provides both surface passivation and electrical isolation, has been demonstrated, paving the way towards the development of Ge-based interdigitated back contact thermophotovoltaic devices. This method offers simultaneous opening of the a-SixC1-x:H layer and creation of a heavily doped region underneath without using photolithographic steps, eventually enabling a low-cost and scalable manufacturing process. This article focuses on the optimization of the n+/p junction formation by studying the effect of different laser energy fluences and number of pulses on the diffusion profiles measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry, and on the electrical performance characterized by Van der Pauw-Hall technique. Additionally, the crystalline quality after PLM has been analyzed by Rutherford backscattering measurements in channeling conditions, high-resolution X-Ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. High level of donor activation (up to 1·1019 cm−3), low sheet resistance (≈50 Ω/□), and high mobility (275–700 cm2/V·s) have been obtained, with a weaker dependency of these parameters on the explored laser energy fluence range. A prototype diode has been developed demonstrating a rectifying behavior but with high saturation current densities. Point-like contact formation will be implemented in future works to reduce the laser irradiated area, and thus, improve the surface passivation and device characteristics.

Abstract: Two terminal multi-junction (MJ) photovoltaic (PV) devices are well established concepts to increase the solar-to-electrical power conversion in reference to single PV junctions. In multi-junction PV devices two consecutive sub-cells are interconnected using a tunnel recombination junction (TRJ) in which the light excited holes of one sub-cell recombine with the light excited electrons of the other sub cell. An ideal TRJ is an ohmic contact with non-rectifying behaviour. TRJ’s based on p- and n-doped silicon-oxides have been successfully applied in a variety of hybrid multi-junction PV devices in which tunnelling and trap-assisted tunnelling over width of 5–20 nm rules the TRJ’s recombination kinetics. In this contribution the qualitative fundamental working principles of tunnel recombination junctions based on p- and n-doped silicon and silicon-oxide alloys are revealed using both electrical modelling and experiments based on a unique set of tandem lab cells (four types based on four different PV materials) combined with structural variations in TRJ architectures. The study results in design rules for the integration of silicon-oxide based TRJ’s and provides fundamental insights into the sensitivity of the electrical performance of the TRJ’s to doping concentrations, to alignment of the conduction and valence bands of consecutive sub-cells, to the nature of interface defects, to the growth of amorphous and crystalline phases and its dependence on substrate or seed layers and to the nanoscale thicknesses of the TRJ layers.

Abstract: Passive thermal control coatings (TCC's) have been widely used to tune the thermal equilibrium of spacecraft surfaces since 1970s. Development of new TCC's with improved thermo-physical properties and radiation hardness are essential to the space assets that fly in harsh environments. Herein, we fabricated calcium orthophosphate based inorganic white paint, which possess relative low solar absorptance (αs) of 0.095 and thermal emittance (εH) of 0.88. Noticeably, the Ca3(PO4)2 coating shows excellent space radiation tolerance and thermal control capacity. After performing 90 keV proton irradiation at a fluence of 4×1015 cm-2, the αs of ZnO coating increases from 0.160 to 0.213 while the Ca3(PO4)2 coating rises from 0.095 to 0112, which only degrades one third (0.017) of the ZnO coating (0.053). Furthermore, after performing simulated solar irradiation test, the surface temperature of Ca3(PO4)2 paint is 14.4 °C lower than that of ZnO coating, evidencing its prominent thermal-optical performance. Besides, we also found that Ga2O3 based liquid-glass white paint is a good candidate for thermal equilibrium of spacecraft.

Abstract: This study proposed a one-step liquid phase deposition (LPD) technique to fabricate a front-side anti-reflective coating (ARC) and rear-side cover layer for a passivated emitter and rear cell solar cell. The production process involves the deposition of TiO2 thin film by using a (NH4)2TiF6 and H3BO3 mixture in a liquid phase filter and cycling deposition system, in which H3BO3 concentration influences the TiO2 thin film deposition rate, the TixSi1-xOy interfacial layer thickness, and thin film quality. The proposed technique is a one-step, uniform, and large-scale double-sided coating batch process viable for non-vacuum environments, thus enabling a simple manufacturing process and requiring low equipment costs. The fabricated LPD-TiO2 thin film demonstrated ASTM 5B adhesion and 3.3% uniformity. The technique involves the use of a 0.2 M (NH4)2TiF6 and 0.5 M H3BO3 mixture for deposition under 50 °C to deposit a 68-nm-thick LPD-TiO2 thin film on pyramid Si wafer. The average reflectance and transmittance of the thin film at 400–800 nm wavelength was 2.7% and 96.5%, respectively. Passivated emitter and rear contact solar cells prepared using the proposed LPD-TiO2 coating technique demonstrated the following outstanding properties: 9.8 A short-circuit current, 0.68 V open circuit voltage, 81.0% fill factor, and 21.3% photoelectric conversion efficiency (η). The proposed technique demonstrates high potential for use in the low-cost manufacturing of silicon solar cells.

Abstract: In order to maintain cellular homeostasis and a healthy state, aberrant and aggregated proteins are to be recognized and rapidly cleared from cells. Parkinson's disease, known to be associated with multiple factors; presents with impaired clearance of aggregated alpha synuclein as a key factor. We endeavored to study microRNA molecules with potential role on regulating multiple checkpoints of protein quality control within cells. Carrying out global miRNA profiling in a transgenic C. elegans model that expresses human alpha synuclein, we identified novel miRNA, miR-4813-3p, as a significantly downregulated molecule. Further studying its putative downstream target genes, we were able to mechanistically characterize six genes gbf-1, vha-5, cup-5, cpd-2, acs-1 and C27A12.7, which relate to endpoints associated with alpha synuclein expression, oxidative stress, locomotory behavior, autophagy and apoptotic pathways. Our study reveals the novel role of miR-4813-3p and provides potential functional characterization of its putative target genes, in regulating the various pathways associated with PQC network. miR-4813-3p modulates ERUPR, MTUPR, autophagosome-lysosomal-pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasomal-system, making this molecule an interesting target for further studies towards therapeutically addressing multifactorial aspect of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: In the context of global warming, radiative coolers with high solar reflectance and strong emissivity in the atmospheric window can cool the substrate as well as the ambient air. Silica at its nano or micro-scale being randomly dispersed into a uniform transparent polymer can form scalable radiative coolers for large-scale application. Promising cooling performance has been reported for silica-polymers compared with conventional cooling materials, but their performance can be largely influenced by various fabrication parameters. So far, how fabrication parameters influence the emissivity and the cooling performance has not been experimentally demonstrated and the cooling capacity of silica-polymers reported was not substantial compared to other superior radiative coolers. In this work, random silica-polymer has been optimized experimentally. Lab measurement and experimental testing of six fabricated silica-polymers under subtropical and desert climates indicated that due to the complexity of the thermo-radiative balance, high emissivity and strong selectivity are both indispensable in the production of high cooling power. If combined with superior reflectors with higher solar reflectance and especially the emissivity in 8–13 μm enhancing the heat dissipation ability, substantial cooling capacity can be achieved: under the harsh desert climate with average peak solar radiation over 1100 Wm-2, the combination presented sub-ambient temperature of maximum 4.7 °C when air temperature reached its peak and the maximum daytime and night-time sub-ambient temperatures were 12.5 °C and 15.9 °C respectively.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification which plays crucial roles in various biological processes, but its role in cementogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using time-series transcriptomic analysis, we reveal that mRNA m6A demethylase Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is involved in cementogenesis. Knocking down FTO decreases cementoblast differentiation and mineralization in both OCCM-30 cellular model and murine ectopic bone formation model. Mechanistically, we find that FTO directly binds Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) mRNA, an important cementogenesis factor, thus protecting it from YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2) mediated degradation, when cementoblasts are differentiating. Knocking down YTHDF2 restores the expression of Runx2 in FTO-knockdown cells. Moreover, under inflammatory conditions, TNF-α inhibits cementoblast differentiation and mineralization partly through FTO/RUNX2 axis. Collectively, our study reveals an important regulatory role of FTO/RUNX2 axis in normal and pathological cementogenesis.

Abstract: InxGa1-xN/GaN solar cells are ideal candidates for use in extreme temperature applications. The conversion efficiency potential of double heterostructure solar cells was investigated at high temperatures using physical simulation. For a targeted working temperature, optimized efficiency lies in a compromise between the absorber bandgap energy determined by In composition and the band offsets at the heterointerface directly correlated with the capability for the photogenerated carriers to cross through the barrier by thermoionic emission. An optimized efficiency of 18% is obtained for an In content of 50% at 400K and decreases down to 10% for an In content of 35% at 500K. As the operating temperature goes higher, the indium content needs to be reduced in order to limit the detrimental effect of increasing intrinsic carrier concentration. The consequence is a decreasing efficiency due to the reduced covered range of the solar spectrum. In the same time, the band offsets are no more a limiting parameter, as there are reduced as the In content decreases, and as higher temperature increases the thermionic transport probability. This result shows the interest of InxGa1-xN/GaN double heterostructure design for high temperatures applications.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells are promising in photovoltaic industry with excellent photoelectric properties. However, defects in perovskite films have seriously affected the device efficiency. In this study, a conjugated molecule of biphenyl-4,4′-dithiol was utilized to coordinate with Pb2+ in perovskite film to passivate defects in perovskite grain boundaries and on perovskite surface, at the same time to protect the perovskite layer to isolate water and oxygen and improve the stability of devices. The experimental result indicates that the quality of perovskite films is improved by both doping biphenyl-4,4′-dithiol into perovskite precursor and depositing it on perovskite films. By combining the two methods together, the energy conversion efficiency of devices increases from 13.4% to 15.2% for large scale devices (active area 0.25 cm2) and 17.2%–20.3% for small devices (active area 0.09 cm2).

Abstract: CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cell has become a hot research object due to its excellent stability. It has been proved that anti-solvent washing is a good way to improve the crystal quality of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials using a one-step spin-coating method. However, it is rarely reported in the preparation of all-inorganic perovskite materials. Here, an anti-solvent rinsing strategy was introduced for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 films via the multi-step spin-coating process. We found that the addition of anti-solvent with high boiling points could significantly improve the surface morphology and crystal quality of CsPbBr3 films by optimizing the nucleation and crystallization of PbBr2 films. By virtue of the anti-solvent rinsing strategy, the highest efficiency of 9.6% and long-term stability over 800 h in ambient air without encapsulation were achieved. Our conclusions provide a certain reference value for the preparation of highly efficient and stable CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: The crystal structure and architecture of electrochromic (EC) materials are the key factors for their performance. In this paper, Mo-doped crystalline/amorphous WO3 (c/a-WO3) are fabricated via facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods, which combine the advantages of excellent cycle stability (c-WO3 nanobars) and fast switching speed and high coloring efficiency (Mo-doped a-WO3 thin films) of different WO3 structure. By optimizing the hydrothermal and electrodeposition parameters, the core-shell c/a-WO3 EC material shows a significant optical modulation (67.8%) owing to the low energy barrier and rapid ion migration in Mo-doped a-WO3 shell. More importantly, the EC devices based on Mo-doped c/a-WO3 exhibit fast switching speeds and high coloration efficiency (104.98 cm2/C) due to enhanced Li+ diffusivity. These great electrochemical performances could be attributed to the amorphous shell and the proper structure distortion caused by doped atoms. Meanwhile, the EC devices exhibit good cycling stability as the transmittance modulation has no decrease after 23000 s. As an energy storage device, the EC supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 10.8 Wh/kg at a power of 117.6 W/kg and long cycle life (72.8% capacitance retention over 1500 cycles). The metal-doped core-shell structure can provide a reliable solution to produce high-performance EC materials and devices such as energy-saving smart windows, outdoor static displays and other energy-efficient applications.

Abstract: External luminescence quantum yields of subcells within several multijunction solar cells were measured using a calibrated hyperspectral imaging system in absolute electroluminescence mode. The measurements allowed direct comparison of subcell device parameters using the electro-optical reciprocity relationship. In particular, differences in the open circuit voltages or even the shape of the current vs voltage curves under air mass 0 illumination among similar subcells can be correlated with the variations in luminescence yields. One important finding of this work is that electroluminescence measurements can help inform solar cell electrical models such as the two-diode model in terms of better parameter selection. We compare energy losses among the different subcells and discuss how the differences in various loss terms affect the overall device performance. Some strategies to improve the overall solar cell device performance are further discussed as a result of this comparative study.

Abstract: Transparent conducting oxide films were performed from SnO2-doped In2O3 with different doping ratio of 97:3 and 95:5 (ITO) by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering in argon and oxygen atmosphere. The effect of oxygen content on the structural, electrical and optical properties of films was investigated. Proper oxygen content improved the properties of ITO films. All films showed the polycrystalline structures. The optimal Hall mobility and resistivity reached 32.2 cm2/V·S and 4.5 × 10−4 Ω cm, respectively. The average transmittance in the 400–1100 nm wavelength range was above 88 %. The optimized ITO films with Lightly and heavily doped ratio are appropriately chosen as front and back electrode of silicon heterojunction solar cells respectively, and the conversion efficiency of more than 24 % were obtained.

Abstract: Ceramic particles based packed bed systems are attracting the interesting from various high-temperature applications such as thermal energy storage, nuclear cooling reactors, and catalytic support structures. Considering that these systems work above 600 °C, thermal radiation becomes significant or even the major heat transfer mechanism. The use of coatings with different thermal and optical properties could represent a way to tune and enhance the thermodynamic performances of the packed bed systems. In this study, the thermal stability of several metallic (Inconel, Nitinol, and Stainless Steel) based coatings is investigated at both high temperature and cyclic thermal conditions. Consequently, the optical properties and their temperature dependence are measured. The results show that both Nitinol and Stainless Steel coatings have excellent thermal stability at temperature as high as 1000 °C and after multiple thermal cycles. Contrarily, Inconel (particularly 625) based coatings shows abundant coating degradation. The investigated coatings also offer a wide range of thermal emissivity (between 0.6 and 0.9 in the temperature range of 400–1000 °C), and variable trends against increasing temperature. This work is a stepping-stone towards further detailed experimental and modelling studies on the heat transfer enhancement in different ceramic-based packed bed applications through using metallic coatings.

Abstract: VEGF secretion into the tumor microenvironment by cancer cells regulates several oncogenic signaling pathways and cancer-regulated angiogenesis. VEGFR receptors are exclusively present on endothelial cells to maintain their biological homeostasis. The acquisition of unique VEGFR2 receptor and VEGFa in cervical cancer (CC) cells reflects VEGFa/VEGFR2 autocrine machinery. Given the critical role of VEGFR2 in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, we explored its function in CC epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Here we report that VEGFR2 regulates cancer-induced angiogenesis and EMT-linked stemness in CC cells via AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin and Snail pathway. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi) of VEGFR, Pazopanib (PAZ), shows potential anti-VEGFR2 activity and inhibits VEGFa induced metastatic events such as migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance in CC cells. Similarly, PAZ also attenuates cancer-regulated angiogenesis by inhibiting VE-cadherin internalization in endothelial cells followed by inhibition of endothelial cell migration. Selective depletion of VEGFR2 ligand VEGFa in CC cells also attenuates EMT, metastatic events, and inhibition of cancer-induced angiogenesis. In addition, blocking of VEGFR2 signaling in CC cells via PAZ or shRNA alters the formation of cervical tumorspheres (TS) and their successive generation. Collectively, inhibition of functional VEGFa/VEGFR2 autocrine and paracrine axis ceases the cancer-promoting events in cervical cancer cells. Based on the finding in this study, this oncogenic pathways could be used as a potential therapeutic target in a clinical setting with conventional radio-chemotherapy to achieve synergistic killing of CC cells.

Abstract: Due to the increasing power consumption for air-conditioning, the power-free passive radiative cooling technique has drawn great attentions in recent years. Blackbody-like broadband emitter and 8–13 μm selective emitter are the two major types of emitters used in current techniques. In this work, we put forward a new type of emitter which has high emissivity in the two atmospheric windows (8–13 μm & 16–25 μm) while maintaining high reflectance at other wavelengths. The proposed emitter has greater cooling potential than both selective and broadband emitters according to our calculations, expect for the extreme sub-ambient conditions. To approach this new emissive characteristic, based on PDMS film, we exploited the guided-mode resonance in the two-dimensional photonic crystal, which introduces a reflectance window between the two atmospheric windows. As the simulation results indicate, the emitter with structural optimization is able to achieve a temperature drop approaching 15 K for ambient temperature Ta = 300 K, non-radiative heat transfer coefficient hc = 2.0 W/m2/K and 3% solar absorption. We believe that it is the first attempt to exploit guided mode resonance in passive radiative cooling applications. Hopefully, this work may provide the researchers a new scheme in terms of the spectral property when designing radiative coolers.

Abstract: Using the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of light to enhance the output of encapsulated solar panels will promote the wider use of solar power. In this work, fluorescent carbon quantum dots anchored on porous silica film with preferable yellow/orange emission were prepared via solvothermal fabrication, the sol-gel method, and coating onto the top glass of a solar panel in sequence. Structural evolution investigations, optical characterizations, and performance evaluations were carried out to demonstrate the anchoring effects. The film was dual-functional due to its inclusion of anti-reflection (AR) and luminescence down-shifting (LDS) materials. This solid material provided a better means of solar panel encapsulation and achieved electrical gain, as the anchoring effect avoided the dispersion of LDS materials inside the encapsulation. Placing the film on top of the solar panel could guarantee the best UV absorption/conversion for LDS. In conclusion, the inclusion of a new fluorescent material was compatible with the standard AR process of photovoltaic glass with no additional cost.
