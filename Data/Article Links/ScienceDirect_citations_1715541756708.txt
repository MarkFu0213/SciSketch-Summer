Abstract: Summary
We sequenced Drosophila head RNA to identify a small set of miRNAs that undergo robust circadian cycling. We concentrated on a cluster of six miRNAs, mir-959-964, all of which peak at about ZT12 or lights off. The cluster pri-miRNA is transcribed under bona fide circadian transcriptional control, and all six mature miRNAs have short half-lives, a requirement for cycling. A viable Gal4 knockin strain localizes prominent cluster miRNA expression to the adult head fat body. Analysis of cluster knockout and overexpression strains indicates that innate immunity, metabolism, and feeding behavior are under cluster miRNA regulation. Manipulation of food intake also affects the levels and timing of cluster miRNA transcription with no more than minor effects on the core circadian oscillator. These observations indicate a feedback circuit between feeding time and cluster miRNA expression function as well as a surprising role of posttranscriptional regulation in the circadian control of these phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Tetraspanins are commonly believed to act only as “molecular facilitators,” with no direct role in signal transduction. We herein demonstrate that upon ligation, CD37, a tetraspanin molecule expressed on mature normal and transformed B cells, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated, associates with proximal signaling molecules, and initiates a cascade of events leading to apoptosis. Moreover, we have identified two tyrosine residues with opposing regulatory functions: one lies in the N-terminal domain of CD37 in a predicted “ITIM-like” motif and mediates SHP1-dependent death, whereas the second lies in a predicted “ITAM motif” in the C-terminal domain of CD37 and counteracts death signals by mediating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent survival.

Abstract: Summary
Proper assembly of kinetochores (KTs) during mitosis is required for bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules (MTs) and the accumulation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components. Here we show that testis-expressed protein 14 (Tex14), which has been implicated in midbody function, is recruited to KTs by Plk1 in a Cdk1-dependent manner during early mitosis. Exclusion of Tex14 from kinetochores results in an inability to efficiently localize outer KT components, impaired KT-MT attachment, chromosome congression defects, and whole-chromosome instability. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tex14 by Plk1 during metaphase promotes APCCdc20-mediated Tex14 degradation. Inhibition of this phosphorylation event causes retention of Tex14 at KTs and results in delayed metaphase-to-anaphase transition and chromosome segregation defects. Our findings identify Tex14 as an important mediator of KT structure and function and the fidelity of chromosome separation.

Abstract: Summary
Many types of human tumor cells have overexpressed pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). However, the mechanism underlying this increased PKM2 expression remains to be defined. We demonstrate here that EGFR activation induces PLCγ1-dependent PKCε monoubiquitylation at Lys321 mediated by RINCK1 ubiquitin ligase. Monoubiquitylated PKCε interacts with a ubiquitin-binding domain in NEMO zinc finger and recruits the cytosolic IKK complex to the plasma membrane, where PKCε phosphorylates IKKβ at Ser177 and activates IKKβ. Activated RelA interacts with HIF1α, which is required for RelA to bind the PKM promoter. PKCε- and NF-κB-dependent PKM2 upregulation is required for EGFR-promoted glycolysis and tumorigenesis. In addition, PKM2 expression correlates with EGFR and IKKβ activity in human glioblastoma specimens and with grade of glioma malignancy. These findings highlight the distinct regulation of NF-κB by EGF, in contrast to TNF-α, and the importance of the metabolic cooperation between the EGFR and NF-κB pathways in PKM2 upregulation and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
2′,5′-linked oligoadenylates (2-5As) serve as conserved messengers of pathogen presence in the mammalian innate immune system. 2-5As induce self-association and activation of RNase L, which cleaves cytosolic RNA and promotes the production of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines driven by the transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-κB. We report that human RNase L is activated by forming high-order complexes, reminiscent of the mode of activation of the phylogenetically related transmembrane kinase/RNase Ire1 in the unfolded protein response. We describe crystal structures determined at 2.4 Å and 2.8 Å resolution, which show that two molecules of 2-5A at a time tether RNase L monomers via the ankyrin-repeat (ANK) domain. Each ANK domain harbors two distinct sites for 2-5A recognition that reside 50 Å apart. These data reveal a function for the ANK domain as a 2-5A-sensing homo-oligomerization device and describe a nonlinear, ultrasensitive regulation in the 2-5A/RNase L system poised for amplification of the IFN response.

Abstract: Summary
Complex genome organizations participate in various nuclear processes including transcription, DNA replication, and repair. However, the mechanisms that generate and regulate these functional genome structures remain largely unknown. Here, we describe how the Ku heterodimer complex, which functions in nonhomologous end joining, mediates clustering of long terminal repeat retrotransposons at centromeres in fission yeast. We demonstrate that the CENP-B subunit, Abp1, functions as a recruiter of the Ku complex, which in turn loads the genome-organizing machinery condensin to retrotransposons. Intriguingly, histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) acetylation, which functions in DNA replication and repair, interferes with Ku localization at retrotransposons without disrupting Abp1 localization and, as a consequence, dissociates condensin from retrotransposons. This dissociation releases condensin-mediated genomic associations during S phase and upon DNA damage. ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase mediates the DNA damage response of condensin-mediated genome organization. Our study describes a function of H3K56 acetylation that neutralizes condensin-mediated genome organization.

Abstract: Summary
Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) is a congenital brain anomaly that results in pituitary, optic nerve, and midline forebrain defects. The etiology of SOD is poorly understood, with the majority of cases being sporadic. In rare instances, SOD is caused by mutations in Sox2, Sox3, or Hesx1, but how this manifests in disease is not entirely certain. We demonstrate here that mouse embryos lacking Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the prospective hypothalamus exhibit key features of SOD, including pituitary hypoplasia and absence of the optic disc. The hypothalamic source of Shh is required to maintain gene expression boundaries along the anteroposterior and mediolateral neural axes that are important for proper pituitary and eye development, respectively. We further reveal that Sox2 and Sox3 are dose-dependent regulators of Shh transcription that directly bind and activate a long-range Shh forebrain enhancer. These data indicate that reduced levels of Shh expression in the hypothalamus cause SOD.

Abstract: Defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides, are one of the first lines of host defense. Human beta-defensins (hBD) such as hBD-2 and -3 have anti-HIV activity. Previous studies have shown that HIV-1 virion can induce the expression of hBD, although the exact components of HIV-1 virion that are responsible for hBD expression have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we examined the effect of HIV-1 Tat on the expression of hBD in B cells. Stimulation of B cells with HIV-1 Tat protein significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of hBD-2. HIV-1 Tat also induced the activation of a reporter gene for hBD-2 in a dose-dependent manner in B cells. Pretreatment of B cells with a JNK inhibitor suppressed HIV-1 Tat-induced hBD-2 expression. Pretreatment of B cells with AP-1 inhibitors or NF-κB inhibitors led to a decrease in HIV-1 Tat-induced protein and mRNA expression of hBD-2. Taken together, our results indicate that HIV-1 Tat can up-regulate the expression of hBD-2 via JNK-NF-κB/AP-1-dependent pathways in human B cells.

Abstract: More recently, we have reported the beneficial effects of ghrelin in improvement of histopathological features of the rat testis following local heat exposure. However, the exact mechanism and the precise role of apoptosis- and proliferation-specific proteins in this regeneration process remained to be explored. Thus, thirty adult male Wistar rats were allotted for the experiment and subdivided equally into three groups: control-saline (CS), heat-saline (HS) and heat-ghrelin (HG). The scrota of HS and HG groups were immersed once in water bath at 43°C for 15min. HG animals received 2nmol of ghrelin subcutaneously immediately after heating every other day until day 60 and the other groups were given physiological saline using the same method. The testes of all groups were taken after rat killing on days 30 and 60 after heat treatment for immunocytochemical detection of pro-apoptotic factor Bax, anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and proliferation-associated peptide PCNA in the germ cells. Ghrelin could significantly suppress the Bax expression in spermatocytes compared to the HS group at day 30 (P<0.05). Likewise, the mean percentages of spermatogonia containing Bax substance were lower in ghrelin-exposed animals, however the differences were not statistically significant. There were immunoreactive cells against Bcl-2 in each germ cell neither in the control nor in the heated animals of experimental groups. In contrast, the number of PCNA immunolabeling cells were higher in HG group in compared to HS or CS animals on both experimental days (P<0.001). Down-regulation of Bax expression concurrent with overexpression of PCNA in HG group indicates the ability of ghrelin in acceleration of testicular germ cells regeneration following heat stress. These findings indicate that ghrelin may be used as a novel and efficient antioxidant agent to induce resumption of spermatogenesis upon environmental heat exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Pax3 and Pax7 regulate stem cell function in skeletal myogenesis. However, molecular insight into their distinct roles has remained elusive. Using gene expression data combined with genome-wide binding-site analysis, we show that both Pax3 and Pax7 bind identical DNA motifs and jointly activate a large panel of genes involved in muscle stem cell function. Surprisingly, in adult myoblasts Pax3 binds a subset (6.4%) of Pax7 targets. Despite a significant overlap in their transcriptional network, Pax7 regulates distinct panels of genes involved in the promotion of proliferation and inhibition of myogenic differentiation. We show that Pax7 has a higher binding affinity to the homeodomain-binding motif relative to Pax3, suggesting that intrinsic differences in DNA binding contribute to the observed functional difference between Pax3 and Pax7 binding in myogenesis. Together, our data demonstrate distinct attributes of Pax7 function and provide mechanistic insight into the nonredundancy of Pax3 and Pax7 in muscle development.

Molecular Mechanism of Hepcidin-Mediated Ferroportin Internalization Requires Ferroportin Lysines, Not Tyrosines or JAK-STAT,

Abstract: Summary
Ferroportin is the primary means of cellular iron efflux and a key component of iron metabolism. Hepcidin regulates Fpn activity by inducing its internalization and degradation. The mechanism of internalization is reported to require JAK2 activation, phosphorylation of Fpn tyrosine residues 302 and 303, and initiation of transcription through STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings suggest Fpn may be a target for therapeutic intervention through JAK2 modulation. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, Fpn internalization was assessed using several techniques combined with reagents that specifically recognized cell-surface Fpn. In vitro results demonstrated that Hepc-induced Fpn internalization did not require JAK2 or phosphorylation of Fpn residues 302 and 303, nor did it induce JAK-STAT signaling. In vivo, inhibition of JAK2 had no effect on Hepc-induced hypoferremia. However, internalization was delayed by mutation of two Fpn lysine residues that may be targets of ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an important regulator of cell-fate decision, including cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal, and plays an ambivalent role in tumorigenesis as a tissue-specific tumor suppressor or oncogene. Here, we report that the Von Hippel-Lindau gene product, pVHL, physically interacts with KLF4 and regulates its rapid turnover observed in both differentiated and stem cells. We provide mechanistic insights into KLF4 degradation and show that pVHL depletion in colorectal cancer cells leads to cell-cycle arrest concomitant with increased transcription of the KLF4-dependent p21 gene. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated pVHL and reduced KLF4 levels in colon cancer tissues. We therefore propose that unexpectedly pVHL, via the degradation of KLF4, is a facilitating factor in colorectal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained canonical Wnt signaling requires the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity by sequestration of GSK3 inside multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). Here, we show that Wnt signaling is increased by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, which causes accumulation of MVEs. A similar MVE expansion and increased Wnt responsiveness was found in cells deficient in presenilin, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. The Wnt-enhancing effects were entirely dependent on the functional endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), which is needed for the formation of intraluminal vesicles in MVEs. We suggest that accumulation of late endosomal structures leads to enhanced canonical Wnt signaling through increased Wnt-receptor/GSK3 sequestration. The decrease in GSK3 cytosolic activity stabilized cytoplasmic GSK3 substrates such as β-catenin, the microtubule-associated protein Tau, and other proteins. These results underscore the importance of the endosomal pathway in canonical Wnt signaling and reveal a mechanism for regulation of Wnt signaling by presenilin deficiency.

Abstract: Calcium ions regulate secretory processes in several ways. Most prominently they (i) trigger the release of vesicle contents rapidly and in a highly cooperative way and they (ii) control priming steps, which prepare vesicles for release. The importance of using assays with high time resolution for separating these distinct roles is pointed out here.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent esophageal cancer type in the United States. The TNF-α/mTOR pathway is known to mediate the development of EAC. Additionally, aberrant activation of Gli1, downstream effector of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway, has been observed in EAC. In this study, we found that an activated mTOR/S6K1 pathway promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic function through S6K1-mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, which releases Gli1 from its endogenous inhibitor, SuFu. Moreover, elimination of S6K1 activation by an mTOR pathway inhibitor enhances the killing effects of the HH pathway inhibitor. Together, our results established a crosstalk between the mTOR/S6K1 and HH pathways, which provides a mechanism for SMO-independent Gli1 activation and also a rationale for combination therapy for EAC.

Abstract: Summary
BMP signals play pivotal roles in dorsoventral patterning of vertebrate embryos. The role of Ppp4c, the catalytic subunit of ubiquitous protein phosphatase 4, in vertebrate embryonic development and underlying mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of zebrafish ppp4cb and/or ppp4ca inhibits ventral development in embryos and also blocks ventralizing activity of ectopic Smad5. Biochemical analyses reveal that Ppp4c is a direct binding partner and transcriptional coactivator of Smad1/Smad5. In response to BMP, Ppp4c is recruited to the Smad1-occupied promoter, and its phosphatase activity is essential in inhibiting HDAC3 activity and, consequently, potentiating transcriptional activation. Consistently, genetic or chemical interference of Hdac3 expression or activity compromises the dorsalizing phenotype induced by ppp4cb knockdown. We conclude that Ppp4c is a critical positive regulator of BMP/Smad signaling during embryonic dorsoventral pattern formation in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
The response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) entails the hierarchical recruitment of proteins orchestrated by ATM-dependent phosphorylation and RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation. As in most ubiquitin-dependent processes, the ordered accumulation of DNA repair factors at the break site relies on ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs). However, how UBDs select their ligands is poorly understood, and therefore we sought to uncover the basis for selectivity in the ubiquitin-dependent DSB response. We show that RNF168, its paralog RNF169, RAD18, and the BRCA1-interacting RAP80 protein accumulate at DSB sites through the use of bipartite modules composed of UBDs juxtaposed to peptide motifs that provide specificity. These sequences, named LR motifs (LRMs), are transferable, and we show that the RNF169 LRM2 binds to nucleosomes, the substrates of RNF168. The LRM-based selection of ligands is a parsimonious means to build a highly discrete ubiquitin-based signaling pathway such as the DNA damage response.

Abstract: Notch pathway plays a pivotal role in cell fate determination. There is much interest surrounding its therapeutic potential, in osteoarthritis, but the expression profile of Notch-related molecules, as well as their relation with cartilage pathological parameters, remains unclear. The purpose of our study is to analyze the expression pattern of Notch family members, type II and type I collagen, in normal (healthy) and osteoarthritic human knee cartilage. Osteoarthritic cartilages were obtained from 3 patients undergoing a total knee replacement. Macroscopically normal cartilage was dissected from 3 human knees at the time of autopsy or surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using Notch1,2,3 and 4, Delta, Jagged, type II collagen and type I collagen antibodies. In healthy cartilage, type II collagen was abundantly expressed while type I was absent. This latter increased proportionally to the osteoarthritic grade. Type II collagen expression remained intense in osteoarthritic cartilage. In healthy cartilage as well as in cartilage with minor lesions, Notch family member's proteins were not or just weakly expressed at the surface and in the cells. However, Notch molecules were over-expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage compared to healthy one. This expression pattern was different according to the cartilage zone and the severity of OA. Our data suggest that Notch signaling is activated in osteoarthritic cartilage, compared to healthy cartilage, with a much more abundant expression in the most damaged areas.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes encoding respectively polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. Polycystin-2 stimulates the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R), a Ca2+-release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The effect of ER-located polycystin-1 is less clear. Polycystin-1 has been reported both to stimulate and to inhibit the IP3R. We now studied the effect of polycystin-1 and of polycystin-2 on the IP3R activity under conditions where the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was kept constant and the reuptake of released Ca2+ was prevented. We also studied the interdependence of the interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 with the IP3R. The experiments were done in conditionally immortalized human proximal-tubule epithelial cells in which one or both polycystins were knocked down using lentiviral vectors containing miRNA-based short hairpins. The Ca2+ release was induced in plasma membrane-permeabilized cells by various IP3 concentrations at a fixed Ca2+ concentration under unidirectional 45Ca2+-efflux conditions. We now report that knock down of polycystin-1 or of polycystin-2 inhibited the IP3-induced Ca2+ release. The simultaneous presence of the two polycystins was required to fully amplify the IP3-induced Ca2+ release, since the presence of polycystin-1 alone or of polycystin-2 alone did not result in an increased Ca2+ release. These novel findings indicate that ER-located polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 operate as a functional complex. They are compatible with the view that loss-of-function mutations in PKD1 and in PKD2 both cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control depends on phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). To examine the role of PERK in cognitive function, we selectively disrupted PERK expression in the adult mouse forebrain. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of PERK-deficient mice, eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 expression were diminished and were associated with enhanced behavioral perseveration, decreased prepulse inhibition, reduced fear extinction, and impaired behavioral flexibility. Treatment with the glycine transporter inhibitor SSR504734 normalized eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4 expression, and behavioral flexibility in PERK-deficient mice. Moreover, the expression levels of PERK and ATF4 were reduced in the frontal cortex of human patients with schizophrenia. Together, our findings reveal that PERK plays a critical role in information processing and cognitive function and that modulation of eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 expression may represent an effective strategy for treating behavioral inflexibility associated with several neurological disorders such as schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
One of the unique characteristics of cellular signaling pathways is that a common signaling pathway can selectively regulate multiple cellular functions of a hormone; however, this selective downstream control through a common signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here we show that the insulin-dependent AKT pathway uses temporal patterns multiplexing for selective regulation of downstream molecules. Pulse and sustained insulin stimulations were simultaneously encoded into transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. The downstream molecules, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) selectively decoded transient, sustained, and both transient and sustained AKT phosphorylation, respectively. Selective downstream decoding is mediated by the molecules' network structures and kinetics. Our results demonstrate that the AKT pathway can multiplex distinct patterns of blood insulin, such as pulse-like additional and sustained-like basal secretions, and the downstream molecules selectively decode secretion patterns of insulin.

Abstract: Summary
In E. coli homologous recombination, a filament of RecA protein formed on DNA searches and pairs a homologous sequence within a second DNA molecule with remarkable speed and fidelity. Here, we directly probe the strength of the two-molecule interactions involved in homology search and recognition using dual-molecule manipulation, combining magnetic and optical tweezers. We find that the filament's secondary DNA-binding site interacts with a single strand of the incoming double-stranded DNA during homology sampling. Recognition requires opening of the helix and is strongly promoted by unwinding torsional stress. Recognition is achieved upon binding of both strands of the incoming dsDNA to each of two ssDNA-binding sites in the filament. The data indicate a physical picture for homology recognition in which the fidelity of the search process is governed by the distance between the DNA-binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of foreign materials is the first step of successful immune responses. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was shown to directly bind cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a bacterial second messenger, and to elicit strong interferon responses. Here we elucidate the structural features of the cytosolic c-di-GMP binding domain (CBD) of STING and its complex with c-di-GMP. The CBD exhibits an α + β fold and is a dimer in the crystal and in solution. Surprisingly, one c-di-GMP molecule binds to the central crevice of a STING dimer, using a series of stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. We show that STING is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the CBD and the C-terminal tail (CTT) and that c-di-GMP releases STING from this autoinhibition by displacing the CTT. The structures provide a remarkable example of pathogen-host interactions in which a unique microbial molecule directly engages the innate immune system.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide studies have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) lacking protein-coding capacity. However, most lncRNAs are expressed at a very low level, and in most cases there is no genetic evidence to support their in vivo function. Malat1 (metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant and highly conserved lncRNAs, and it exhibits an uncommon 3′-end processing mechanism. In addition, its specific nuclear localization, developmental regulation, and dysregulation in cancer are suggestive of it having a critical biological function. We have characterized a Malat1 loss-of-function genetic model that indicates that Malat1 is not essential for mouse pre- and postnatal development. Furthermore, depletion of Malat1 does not affect global gene expression, splicing factor level and phosphorylation status, or alternative pre-mRNA splicing. However, among a small number of genes that were dysregulated in adult Malat1 knockout mice, many were Malat1 neighboring genes, thus indicating a potential cis-regulatory role of Malat1 gene transcription.

Control of Seed Germination by Light-Induced Histone Arginine Demethylation Activity,

Abstract: Summary
For optimal survival, various environmental and endogenous factors should be monitored to determine the appropriate timing for seed germination. Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination, which is perceived by phytochromes. The light-dependent activation of phytochrome B (PHYB) modulates abscisic acid and gibberellic acid signaling and metabolism. Thus far, several negative regulators of seed germination that act when PHYB is inactive have been reported. However, neither positive regulators of seed germination downstream of PHYB nor a direct mechanism for regulation of the hormone levels has been elucidated. Here, we show that the histone arginine demethylases, JMJ20 and JMJ22, act redundantly as positive regulators of seed germination. When PHYB is inactive, JMJ20/JMJ22 are directly repressed by the zinc-finger protein SOMNUS. However, upon PHYB activation, JMJ20/JMJ22 are derepressed, resulting in increased gibberellic acid levels through the removal of repressive histone arginine methylations at GA3ox1/GA3ox2, which in turn promotes seed germination.

Abstract: Summary
Rapamycin and its derivatives are mTOR inhibitors used in tissue transplantation and cancer therapy. A percentage of patients treated with these inhibitors develop diabetic-like symptoms, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. We show here that chronic rapamycin treatment in mice led to insulin resistance with suppression of insulin/IGF signaling and genes associated within this pathway, such as Igf1-2, Irs1-2, and Akt1-3. Importantly, skeletal muscle-specific YY1 knockout mice were protected from rapamycin-induced diabetic-like symptoms. This protection was caused by hyperactivation of insulin/IGF signaling with increased gene expression in this cascade that, in contrast to wild-type mice, was not suppressed by rapamycin. Mechanistically, rapamycin induced YY1 dephosphorylation and recruitment to promoters of insulin/IGF genes, which promoted interaction with the polycomb protein-2 corepressor. This was associated with H3K27 trimethylation leading to decreased gene expression and insulin signaling. These results have implications for rapamycin action in human diseases and biological processes such as longevity.

Abstract: The Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channel TRPC6 is gated via phospholipase C-activating receptors and has recently been implicated in hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Therefore, TRPC6 is a promising target for pharmacological interference. To identify and develop TRPC6-blocking compounds, we screened the Chembionet library, a collection of 16,671 chemically diverse drug-like compounds, for biological activity to prevent the 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-triggered Ca2+ influx in a stably transfected HEKTRPC6-YFP cell line. Hits were validated and characterised by fluorometric and electrophysiological methods. Six compounds displayed inhibitory potency at low micromolar concentrations, lack of cytotoxicity and blocked the receptor-dependent mode of TRPC6 activation. The specificity was tested towards closely (TRPC3 and TRPC7) and more distantly related TRP channels. One of the compounds, 8009-5364, displayed a 2.5-fold TRPC6-selectivity compared to TRPC3, and almost no inhibition of TRPC7 or the other TRP channels tested. Block of native TRPC3/6-like responses was confirmed in dissociated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Two non-polar blockers effectively suppressed the HPV responses in the perfused mouse lung model. We conclude that pharmacological targeting of TRPC6 is feasible and provide a promising concept to treat pulmonary diseases that are characterised by excessive hypoxic vasoconstriction.

Abstract: Summary
The proepicardial organ is an important transient structure that contributes cells to various cardiac lineages. However, its contribution to the coronary endothelium has been disputed, with conflicting data arising in chick and mouse. Here we resolve this conflict by identifying two proepicardial markers, Scleraxis (Scx) and Semaphorin3D (Sema3D), that genetically delineate heretofore uncharacterized proepicardial subcompartments. In contrast to previously fate-mapped Tbx18/WT-1-expressing cells that give rise to vascular smooth muscle, Scx- and Sema3D-expressing proepicardial cells give rise to coronary vascular endothelium both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Sema3D+ and Scx+ proepicardial cells contribute to the early sinus venosus and cardiac endocardium, respectively, two tissues linked to vascular endothelial formation at later stages. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that the proepicardial organ is a molecularly compartmentalized structure, reconciling prior chick and mouse data and providing a more complete understanding of the progenitor populations that establish the coronary vascular endothelium.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression shows a significant variation (noise) between genetically identical cells. Noise depends on the gene expression process regulated by the chromatin environment. We screened for chromatin factors that modulate noise in S. cerevisiae and analyzed the results using a theoretical model that infers regulatory mechanisms from the noise versus mean relationship. Distinct activities of the Rpd3(L) and Set3 histone deacetylase complexes were predicted. Both HDACs repressed expression. Yet, Rpd3(L)C decreased the frequency of transcriptional bursts, while Set3C decreased the burst size, as did H2B monoubiquitination (ubH2B). We mapped the acetylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) upon deletion of multiple subunits of Set3C and Rpd3(L)C and of ubH2B effectors. ubH2B and Set3C appear to function in the same pathway to reduce the probability that an elongating PolII produces a functional transcript (PolII processivity), while Rpd3(L)C likely represses gene expression at a step preceding elongation.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling induced by cell surface ligands is critical to development and maintenance of many eukaryotic organisms. Notch and its ligands are integral membrane proteins that facilitate direct cell-cell interactions to activate Notch proteolysis and release the intracellular domain that directs Notch-specific cellular responses. Genetic studies suggest that Notch ligands require endocytosis, ubiquitylation, and epsin endocytic adaptors to activate signaling, but the exact role of ligand endocytosis remains unresolved. Here we characterize a molecularly distinct mode of clathrin-mediated endocytosis requiring ligand ubiquitylation, epsins, and actin for ligand cells to activate signaling in Notch cells. Using a cell-bead optical tweezers system, we obtained evidence for cell-mediated mechanical force dependent on this distinct mode of ligand endocytosis. We propose that the mechanical pulling force produced by endocytosis of Notch-bound ligand drives conformational changes in Notch that permit activating proteolysis.

Nutrient restriction preserves calcium cycling and mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes during ischemia and reperfusion,

Abstract: Nutrient restriction (NR) prolongs longevity via enhanced mitochondrial function. We tested the hypothesis that NR enhances resistance to ischemia/reperfusion (IR) arrhythmias via preserved calcium (Ca) cycling and mitochondrial function. We examined the protective effects of NR on regional IR in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers. Optical mapping of intracellular Ca and mitochondrial membrane potential Δψm was performed using Rhod 2-AM and TMRE, respectively. Regional ischemia was mimicked by covering a portion of monolayer with a glass coverslip until loss of Ca propagation, and reperfusion was mimicked by removing the coverslip. NR was mimicked by culture in serum- and glucose-free medium for 24h. Relative to controls, NR monolayers: (1) sustained Ca oscillations during longer periods of ischemia (19.2±1.8min vs 10.4±1.4min, p<0.001); (2) had attenuated increases in Ca transient duration (CaD) and time decay constant (Tau) during ischemia; (3) had preserved conduction velocity (CV) during early reperfusion, leading to protection against reperfusion arrhythmias; (4) had minimal “rebound” decreased CaD and Tau during reperfusion; and (5) had no depolarization of Δψm during IR. NR attenuates IR arrhythmias via (1) stable calcium cycling and (2) prevention of Δψm depolarization during IR. Enhanced mitochondrial resistance to IR arrhythmias may play a role in NR-induced longevity prolongation.

Abstract: Summary
MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. MLN4924 is a mechanism-based inhibitor, with enzyme inhibition occurring through the formation of a tight-binding NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct. In cell and xenograft models of cancer, we identified treatment-emergent heterozygous mutations in the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket and NEDD8-binding cleft of NAEβ as the primary mechanism of resistance to MLN4924. Biochemical analyses of NAEβ mutants revealed slower rates of adduct formation and reduced adduct affinity for the mutant enzymes. A compound with tighter binding properties was able to potently inhibit mutant enzymes in cells. These data provide rationales for patient selection and the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors designed to overcome treatment-emergent NAEβ mutations.

Abstract: Odontoblasts are involved in the transduction of stimuli applied to exposed dentin. Although expression of thermo/mechano/osmo-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels has been demonstrated, the properties of TRP vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated signaling remain to be clarified. We investigated physiological and pharmacological properties of TRPV1 and its functional coupling with cannabinoid (CB) receptors and Na+–Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) in odontoblasts. Anandamide (AEA), capsaicin (CAP), resiniferatoxin (RF) or low-pH evoked Ca2+ influx. This influx was inhibited by capsazepine (CPZ). Delay in time-to-activation of TRPV1 channels was observed between application of AEA or CAP and increase in [Ca2+]i. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, however, an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i was observed on administration of extracellular Ca2+, followed by activation of TRPV1 channels. Intracellular application of CAP elicited inward current via opening of TRPV1 channels faster than extracellular application. With extracellular RF application, no time delay was observed in either increase in [Ca2+]i or inward current, indicating that agonist binding sites are located on both extra- and intracellular domains. KB-R7943, an NCX inhibitor, yielded an increase in the decay time constant during TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ entry. Increase in [Ca2+]i by CB receptor agonist, 2-arachidonylglycerol, was inhibited by CB1 receptor antagonist or CPZ, as well as by adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. These results showed that TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ entry functionally couples with CB1 receptor activation via cAMP signaling. Increased [Ca2+]i by TRPV1 activation was extruded by NCXs. Taken together, this suggests that cAMP-mediated CB1-TRPV1 crosstalk and TRPV1-NCX coupling play an important role in driving cellular functions following transduction of external stimuli to odontoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation is associated with DNA damage, cellular senescence, and aging. Cessation of the inflammatory cytokine response is mediated in part through cytokine mRNA degradation facilitated by RNA-binding proteins, including AUF1. We report a major function of AUF1—it activates telomerase expression, suppresses cellular senescence, and maintains normal aging. AUF1-deficient mice undergo striking telomere erosion, markedly increased DNA damage responses at telomere ends, pronounced cellular senescence, and rapid premature aging that increases with successive generations, which can be rescued in AUF1 knockout mice and their cultured cells by resupplying AUF1 expression. AUF1 binds and strongly activates the transcription promoter for telomerase catalytic subunit Tert. In addition to directing inflammatory cytokine mRNA decay, AUF1 destabilizes cell-cycle checkpoint mRNAs, preventing cellular senescence. Thus, a single gene, AUF1, links maintenance of telomere length and normal aging to attenuation of inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibition of cellular senescence.

Abstract: Summary
To model human neural-cell-fate specification and to provide cells for regenerative therapies, we have developed a method to generate human neural progenitors and neurons from human embryonic stem cells, which recapitulates human fetal brain development. Through the addition of a small molecule that activates canonical WNT signaling, we induced rapid and efficient dose-dependent specification of regionally defined neural progenitors ranging from telencephalic forebrain to posterior hindbrain fates. Ten days after initiation of differentiation, the progenitors could be transplanted to the adult rat striatum, where they formed neuron-rich and tumor-free grafts with maintained regional specification. Cells patterned toward a ventral midbrain (VM) identity generated a high proportion of authentic dopaminergic neurons after transplantation. The dopamine neurons showed morphology, projection pattern, and protein expression identical to that of human fetal VM cells grafted in parallel. VM-patterned but not forebrain-patterned neurons released dopamine and reversed motor deficits in an animal model of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Summary
The importance of miRNAs during development and disease processes is well established. However, most studies have been done in cells or with patient tissues, and therefore the physiological roles of miRNAs are not well understood. To unravel in vivo functions of miRNAs, we have generated conditional, reporter-tagged knockout-first mice for numerous evolutionarily conserved miRNAs. Here, we report the generation of 162 miRNA targeting vectors, 64 targeted ES cell lines, and 46 germline-transmitted miRNA knockout mice. In vivo lacZ reporter analysis in 18 lines revealed highly tissue-specific expression patterns and their miRNA expression profiling matched closely with published expression data. Most miRNA knockout mice tested were viable, supporting a mechanism by which miRNAs act redundantly with other miRNAs or other pathways. These data and collection of resources will be of value for the in vivo dissection of miRNA functions in mouse models.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Sox9 is necessary for early chondrogenesis, but its subsequent roles in the cartilage growth plate, a highly specialized structure that drives skeletal growth and endochondral ossification, remain unclear. Using a doxycycline-inducible Cre transgene and Sox9 conditional null alleles in the mouse, we show that Sox9 is required to maintain chondrocyte columnar proliferation and generate cell hypertrophy, two key features of functional growth plates. Sox9 keeps Runx2 expression and β-catenin signaling in check and thereby inhibits not only progression from proliferation to prehypertrophy, but also subsequent acquisition of an osteoblastic phenotype. Sox9 protein outlives Sox9 RNA in upper hypertrophic chondrocytes, where it contributes with Mef2c to directly activate the major marker of these cells, Col10a1. These findings thus reveal that Sox9 remains a central determinant of the lineage fate and multistep differentiation program of growth plate chondrocytes and thereby illuminate our understanding of key molecular mechanisms underlying skeletogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Poorly structured domains in proteins enhance their susceptibility to proteasomal degradation. To learn whether the presence of such a domain near either end of a protein determines its direction of entry into the proteasome, directional translocation was enforced on several proteasome substrates. Using archaeal PAN-20S complexes, mammalian 26S proteasomes, and cultured cells, we identified proteins that are degraded exclusively from either the C or N terminus and some showing no directional preference. This property results from interactions of the substrate's termini with the regulatory ATPase and could be predicted based on the calculated relative stabilities of the N and C termini. Surprisingly, the direction of entry into the proteasome affected markedly the spectrum of peptides released and consequently influenced the efficiency of MHC class I presentation. Thus, easily unfolded termini are translocated first, and the direction of translocation influences the peptides generated and presented to the immune system.

Abstract: DEC1 is a transcription repressor that is induced by Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α/β (HIF-α/β). In this study, we found that either hypoxic treatment or ectopic expression of DEC1 blocks induction of a master adipogenic transactivator, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) in 3T3-L1 cells. DEC1 did not prevent C/EBPβ, which is an upstream transactivator for PPARγ2, from occupying the PPARγ2 promoter. DEC1 occupied the PPARγ2 promoter by interacting with DNA-bound C/EBPβ. DEC1 occupancy was accompanied by a reduction of acetylated histones and an increase in histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) occupancy on the PPARγ2 promoter. Based on the fact that DEC1 interacts with HDAC1, this study suggests that DEC1 blocks adipogenesis by reinforcing HDAC1 recruitment to the PPARγ2 promoter. This study implies that DEC1 is one of the mediators that reset the pattern of PPARγ2 expression in response to hypoxia.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine implicated in induction of T helper 2 (Th2)-mediated allergic inflammation, has recently been shown to stimulate solid tumor growth and metastasis. Conversely, studying mice with clonal loss of Notch signaling in their skin revealed that high levels of TSLP released by barrier-defective skin caused a severe inflammation, resulting in gradual elimination of Notch-deficient epidermal clones and resistance to skin tumorigenesis. We found CD4+ T cells to be both required and sufficient to mediate these effects of TSLP. Importantly, TSLP overexpression in wild-type skin also caused resistance to tumorigenesis, confirming that TSLP functions as a tumor suppressor in the skin.

Abstract: The Na+–Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) mediated Ca2+ fluxes are essential for handling Ca2+ homeostasis in many cell-types. Eukaryotic NCX variants contain regulatory CBD1 and CBD2 domains, whereas in distinct variants the Ca2+ binding to Ca3–Ca4 sites of CBD1 results either in sustained activation, inhibition or no effect. CBD2 contains an alternatively spliced segment, which is expressed in a tissue-specific manner although its impact on allosteric regulation remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that the Ca2+ binding to Ca3–Ca4 sites results in interdomain tethering of CBDs, which rigidifies CBDs movements with accompanied slow dissociation of “occluded” Ca2+. Here we investigate the effects of CBD2 variants on Ca2+ occlusion in the two-domain construct (CBD12). Mutational studies revealed that both sites (Ca3 and Ca4) contribute to Ca2+ occlusion, whereas after dissociation of the first Ca2+ ion the second Ca2+ ion becomes occluded. This mechanism is common for the brain, kidney and cardiac splice variants of CBD12, although the occluded Ca2+ exhibits 20–50-fold difference in off-rates among the tested variants. Therefore, the spliced exons on CBD2 affect the rate-limiting step of the occluded Ca2+ dissociation at the primary regulatory sensor to shape dynamic features of allosteric regulation in NCX variants.

Abstract: Summary
HP1 proteins are major components of heterochromatin, which is generally perceived to be an inert and transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure. Yet, HP1 binding to chromatin is highly dynamic and robust silencing of heterochromatic genes can involve RNA processing. Here, we demonstrate by a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments that the fission yeast HP1Swi6 protein guarantees tight repression of heterochromatic genes through RNA sequestration and degradation. Stimulated by positively charged residues in the hinge region, RNA competes with methylated histone H3K9 for binding to the chromodomain of HP1Swi6. Hence, HP1Swi6 binding to RNA is incompatible with stable heterochromatin association. We propose a model in which an ensemble of HP1Swi6 proteins functions as a heterochromatin-specific checkpoint, capturing and priming heterochromatic RNAs for the RNA degradation machinery. Sustaining a functional checkpoint requires continuous exchange of HP1Swi6 within heterochromatin, which explains the dynamic localization of HP1 proteins on heterochromatin.

Abstract: Summary
The lymphatic system is crucial for fluid homeostasis, immune responses, and numerous pathological processes. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for establishing the anatomical form of the lymphatic vascular network remain largely unknown. Here, we show that chemokine signaling provides critical guidance cues directing early trunk lymphatic network assembly and patterning. The chemokine receptors Cxcr4a and Cxcr4b are expressed in lymphatic endothelium, whereas chemokine ligands Cxcl12a and Cxcl12b are expressed in adjacent tissues along which the developing lymphatics align. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in zebrafish demonstrate that chemokine signaling orchestrates the stepwise assembly of the trunk lymphatic network. In addition to providing evidence for a lymphatic vascular guidance mechanism, these results also suggest a molecular basis for the anatomical coalignment of lymphatic and blood vessels.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the brain that are responsible for the clearance of injured neurons, an essential step in subsequent tissue regeneration. How death signals are controlled both in space and time to attract these cells toward the site of injury is a topic of great interest. To this aim, we have used the optically transparent zebrafish larval brain and identified rapidly propagating Ca2+ waves that determine the range of microglial responses to neuronal cell death. We show that while Ca2+-mediated microglial responses require ATP, the spreading of intercellular Ca2+ waves is ATP independent. Finally, we identify glutamate as a potent inducer of Ca2+-transmitted microglial attraction. Thus, this real-time analysis reveals the existence of a mechanism controlling microglial targeted migration to neuronal injuries that is initiated by glutamate and proceeds across the brain in the form of a Ca2+ wave.

Abstract: Mitochondria are key decoding stations of the apoptotic process. In support of this view, a large body of experimental evidence has unambiguously revealed that, in addition to the well-established function of producing most of the cellular ATP, mitochondria play a fundamental role in triggering apoptotic cell death. Various apoptotic stimuli cause the release of specific mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this release is still controversial, but there is no doubt that mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) overload is one of the pro-apoptotic ways to induce the swelling of mitochondria, with perturbation or rupture of the outer membrane, and in turn the release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors into the cytosol. Here, we review as different proteins that participate in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and in turn modulate the effectiveness of Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. Strikingly, the final outcome at the cellular level is similar, albeit through completely different molecular mechanisms: a reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload upon pro-apoptotic stimuli that dramatically blunts the apoptotic response.

Abstract: Summary
It is a long-held paradigm that cell fusion reprograms gene expression but the extent of reprogramming and whether it is affected by the cell types employed remain unknown. We recently showed that the silencing of somatic genes is attributable to either trans-acting cellular environment or cis-acting chromatin context. Here, we examine how trans- versus cis-silenced genes in a somatic cell type behave in fusions to another somatic cell type or to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We demonstrate that while reprogramming of trans-silenced somatic genes occurs in both cases, reprogramming of cis-silenced somatic genes occurs only in somatic-ESC fusions. Importantly, ESCs reprogram the somatic genome in two distinct phases: trans-reprogramming occurs rapidly, independent of DNA replication, whereas cis-reprogramming occurs with slow kinetics requiring DNA replication. We also show that pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog are cis-silenced in somatic cells. We conclude that cis-reprogramming capacity is a fundamental feature distinguishing ESCs from somatic cells.

Abstract: TRPV6, a highly calcium-selective member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily, is a major pathway for calcium absorption in the fetal and adult body. It is expressed abundantly in the duodenum, the placenta and exocrine tissues. TRVP6 was postulated to contribute to store-operated calcium channel (SOC) activity in certain cell types such as exocrine cells. In this study, we tested 2-APB, a widely used SOC inhibitor on human TRPV6 (hTRPV6) activity using fluorescence imaging, patch clamp and radioactive tracer techniques in transiently and stably transfected HEK293 cells. We found that the basal calcium and cadmium influx was higher in HEK293 cells transfected with hTRPV6 than in non-transfected cells. 2-APB inhibited hTRPV6 activity in both transient and stably transfected cells. This effect was slightly sensitive toward extracellular calcium. The extracellular sodium concentration did not affect the inhibition of hTRPV6 by 2-APB. However, N-methyl-d-glucamine significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of 2-APB presumably through direct interaction with this compound. Furthermore, 2-APB inhibited the activity of TRPV6 orthologs but not human TRPV5. 2-APB may serve as a parental compound for the development of therapeutic strategies specifically targeting the hTRPV6 calcium channel.

Abstract: Summary
NF-κB is central for immune response and cell survival, and its deregulation is linked to chronic inflammation and cancer through poorly defined mechanisms. IκBα and A20 are NF-κB target genes and negative feedback regulators. Upon their activation by NF-κB, DSIF is recruited, P-TEFb is released, and their elongating polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) remains hypophosphorylated. We show that upon DSIF knockdown, mRNA levels of a subset of NF-κB targets are not diminished; yet much less IκBα and A20 protein are synthesized, and NF-κB activation is abnormally prolonged. Further analysis of IκBα and A20 mRNA revealed that a significant portion is uncapped, unspliced, and retained in the nucleus. Interestingly, the Spt5 C-terminal repeat (CTR) domain involved in elongation stimulation through P-TEFb is dispensable for IκBα and A20 regulation. These findings assign a function for DSIF in cotranscriptional mRNA processing when elongating Pol II is hypophosphorylated and define DSIF as part of the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB.

Abstract: Mbu-1 (Csrnp-3) is a mouse gene that was identified in our previous study as showing highly restricted expression to the central nervous system. In this study, to elucidate the regulatory mechanism for tissue specificity of the gene, epigenetic approaches that identify the profiles of CpG methylation, as well as histone modifications at the promoter region were conducted. Methylation-specific PCR revealed that the CpG sites in brain tissues from embryo to adult stages showed virtually no methylation (0.052-0.67%). Lung (9.0%) and pancreas (3.0%) also showed lower levels. Other tissues such as liver, kidney, and heart showed much higher methylation levels ranging from approximately 39-93%. Treatment of 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) significantly decreased promoter methylation, reactivating Mbu-1 expression in NG108-15 and Neuro-2a neuronal cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that 5-Aza-dC decreased levels of acetylated H3K9 and methylated H3K4, and increased methylated H3K9. This result indicates that CpG methylation converses with histone modifications in an opposing sense of regulating Mbu-1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis contributes to the activation, survival, and proliferation of CD4+ T cells upon stimulation through TCR and CD28. Here, we demonstrate that the suppression of this axis by deletion of p85α or PI3K/mTORC1 inhibitors as well as T cell-specific deletion of raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, impairs Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo in a S6K1/2-dependent fashion. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1 axis impairs the downregulation of Gfi1, a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that S6K2, a nuclear counterpart of S6K1, is induced by the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis, binds RORγ, and carries RORγ to the nucleus. These results point toward a pivotal role of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1/2 axis in Th17 differentiation.

Interspecies Signaling through QscR, a Quorum Receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,

Abstract: The QS machinery of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, consists of three acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) signaling systems, LasR-I, RhlR-I, and QscR. QscR, known as an orphan receptor and a repressor of other QS systems, operates its own regulon using N-3-oxododecanoyl HSL (3OC12), which is synthesized by LasI, as its signal. In this study, we addressed the role of QscR in interspecies communication. We found that QscR auto-activates its own transcription in the presence of 3OC12. In a single population of P. aeruginosa, where 3OC12 is the sole signal available for QscR, the QscR regulon is activated by 3OC12 produced by the LasI-R system. However, the broad signal specificity of QscR allowed it to respond to a non-P. aeruginosa signal, such as N-decanoyl HSL (C10) and N-3-hydroxydecanoyl HSL (3OHC10), which preferentially activated QscR to LasR. The signal extracts from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Burkholeria vietnamiensis also preferentially activated QscR. These non-P. aeruginosa signals activated QscR more strongly than 3OC12, the authentic P. aeruginosa signal. Since a variety of acyl-HSLs are produced in the multi-species habitat of nature, our study provides a clue for the particular situation that allows QscR to secede from the conventional QS cascade in mixed microbial community.

Abstract: Summary
We present a coarse-grained modeling approach that spans the nanosecond- to minute-timescale dynamics of cotranslational protein translocation. The method enables direct simulation of both integral membrane protein topogenesis and transmembrane domain (TM) stop-transfer efficiency. Simulations reveal multiple kinetic pathways for protein integration, including a mechanism in which the nascent protein undergoes slow-timescale reorientation, or flipping, in the confined environment of the translocon channel. Competition among these pathways gives rise to the experimentally observed dependence of protein topology on ribosomal translation rate and protein length. We further demonstrate that sigmoidal dependence of stop-transfer efficiency on TM hydrophobicity arises from local equilibration of the TM across the translocon lateral gate, and it is predicted that slowing ribosomal translation yields decreased stop-transfer efficiency in long proteins. This work reveals the balance between equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes in protein targeting, and it provides insight into the molecular regulation of the Sec translocon.

Abstract: Summary
The secondary structure of RNA is necessary for its maturation, regulation, processing, and function. However, the global influence of RNA folding in eukaryotes is still unclear. Here, we use a high-throughput, sequencing-based, structure-mapping approach to identify the paired (double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]) and unpaired (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA]) components of the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans transcriptomes, which allows us to identify conserved features of RNA secondary structure in metazoans. From this analysis, we find that ssRNAs and dsRNAs are significantly correlated with specific epigenetic modifications. Additionally, we find key structural patterns across protein-coding transcripts that indicate that RNA folding demarcates regions of protein translation and likely affects microRNA-mediated regulation of mRNAs in animals. Finally, we identify and characterize 546 mRNAs whose folding pattern is significantly correlated between these metazoans, suggesting that their structure has some function. Overall, our findings provide a global assessment of RNA folding in animals.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation is common in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although four distinct class I PI3K isoforms (α, β, γ, δ) could participate in T-ALL pathogenesis, none has been implicated in this process. We report that in the absence of PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor function, PI3Kγ or PI3Kδ alone can support leukemogenesis, whereas inactivation of both isoforms suppressed tumor formation. The reliance of PTEN null T-ALL on the combined activities of PI3Kγ/δ was further demonstrated by the ability of a dual inhibitor to reduce disease burden and prolong survival in mice as well as prevent proliferation and promote activation of proapoptotic pathways in human tumors. These results support combined inhibition of PI3Kγ/δ as therapy for T-ALL.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of a developmentally expressed protein, Botch, which blocks Notch, in neocortical development. Downregulation of Botch in vivo leads to cellular retention in the ventricular and subventricular zones, whereas overexpression of Botch drives neural stem cells into the intermediate zone and cortical plate. In vitro neurosphere and differentiation assays indicate that Botch regulates neurogenesis by promoting neuronal differentiation. Botch prevents cell surface presentation of Notch by inhibiting the S1 furin-like cleavage of Notch, maintaining Notch in the immature full-length form. Understanding the function of Botch expands our knowledge regarding both the regulation of Notch signaling and the complex signaling mediating neuronal development.

Abstract: Summary
Within high-grade gliomas, the precise identities and functional roles of stem-like cells remain unclear. In the normal neurogenic niche, ID (Inhibitor of DNA-binding) genes maintain self-renewal and multipotency of adult neural stem cells. Using PDGF- and KRAS-driven murine models of gliomagenesis, we show that high Id1 expression (Id1high) identifies tumor cells with high self-renewal capacity, while low Id1 expression (Id1low) identifies tumor cells with proliferative potential but limited self-renewal capacity. Surprisingly, Id1low cells generate tumors more rapidly and with higher penetrance than Id1high cells. Further, eliminating tumor cell self-renewal through deletion of Id1 has modest effects on animal survival, while knockdown of Olig2 within Id1low cells has a significant survival benefit, underscoring the importance of non-self-renewing lineages in disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Arterial stiffening is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but how arteries stay supple is unknown. Here, we show that apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoE-containing high-density lipoprotein (apoE-HDL) maintain arterial elasticity by suppressing the expression of extracellular matrix genes. ApoE interrupts a mechanically driven feed-forward loop that increases the expression of collagen-I, fibronectin, and lysyl oxidase in response to substratum stiffening. These effects are independent of the apoE lipid-binding domain and transduced by Cox2 and miR-145. Arterial stiffness is increased in apoE null mice. This stiffening can be reduced by administration of the lysyl oxidase inhibitor BAPN, and BAPN treatment attenuates atherosclerosis despite highly elevated cholesterol. Macrophage abundance in lesions is reduced by BAPN in vivo, and monocyte/macrophage adhesion is reduced by substratum softening in vitro. We conclude that apoE and apoE-containing HDL promote healthy arterial biomechanics and that this confers protection from cardiovascular disease independent of the established apoE-HDL effect on cholesterol.

Abstract: Cooling can induce Ca2+ signaling via activation of temperature-sensitive ion channels such as TRPM8, TRPA1 and ryanodine receptor channels. Here we have studied the mechanism of cooling-evoked Ca2+ signaling in mouse olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), a specialized type of glial cells in the olfactory nerve layer of the olfactory bulb. Reducing the temperature from above 30°C to 28°C and below triggered Ca2+ transients that persisted in the absence of external Ca2+, but were suppressed after Ca2+ store depletion by cyclopiazonic acid. Cooling-evoked Ca2+ transients were present in mice deficient of TRPM8 and TRPA1, and were not inhibited by ryanodine receptor antagonists. Inhibition of InsP3 receptors with 2-APB and caffeine entirely blocked cooling-evoked Ca2+ transients. Moderate Ca2+ increases, as evoked by flash photolysis of NP-EGTA (caged Ca2+) and cyclopiazonic acid, triggered InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release at 22°C, but not at 31°C. The results suggest that InsP3 receptors mediate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in OECs, and that this Ca2+ release is temperature-sensitive and can be suppressed at temperatures above 28°C.

Abstract: Summary
Super elongation complexes (SECs) contain two different transcription elongation factors, P-TEFb and ELL1/2, linked by the scaffolding protein AFF4 or AFF1. They stimulate the expression of both normal and disease-related genes, especially those of HIV or those involved in leukemogenesis. Among all SEC subunits, ELL2 is stoichiometrically limiting and uniquely regulated at the level of protein stability. Here we identify the RING domain protein Siah1, but not the homologous Siah2, as the E3 ubiquitin ligase for ELL2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Siah1 cannot access and ubiquitinate ELL2 bound to AFF4, although, at high concentrations, it also degrades AFF4/1 to destroy SECs. Prostratin and HMBA, two well-studied activators of HIV transcription and latency, enhance ELL2 accumulation and SECs formation largely through decreasing Siah1 expression and ELL2 polyubiquitination. Given its importance in formation of SECs, the Siah1 ubiquitination pathway provides a fresh avenue for developing strategies to control disease-related transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Growth factors activate Ras, PI3K, and other signaling pathways. It is not well understood how these signals are translated by individual cells into a decision to proliferate or differentiate. Here, using single-cell image analysis of nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated PC12 cells, we identified a two-dimensional phospho-ERK (pERK)-phospho-AKT (pAKT) response map with a curved boundary that separates differentiating from proliferating cells. The boundary position remained invariant when different stimuli were used or upstream signaling components perturbed. We further identified Rasa2 as a negative feedback regulator that links PI3K to Ras, placing the stochastically distributed pERK-pAKT signals close to the decision boundary. This allows for uniform NGF stimuli to create a subpopulation of cells that differentiates with each cycle of proliferation. Thus, by linking a complex signaling system to a simpler intermediate response map, cells gain unique integration and control capabilities to balance cell number expansion with differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Prolonged deficits in neural input activate pathological muscle remodeling, leading to atrophy. In denervated muscle, activation of the atrophy program requires HDAC4, a potent repressor of the master muscle transcription factor MEF2. However, the signaling mechanism that connects HDAC4, a protein deacetylase, to the atrophy machinery remains unknown. Here, we identify the AP1 transcription factor as a critical target of HDAC4 in neurogenic muscle atrophy. In denervated muscle, HDAC4 activates AP1-dependent transcription, whereas AP1 inactivation recapitulates HDAC4 deficiency and blunts the muscle atrophy program. We show that HDAC4 activates AP1 independently of its canonical transcriptional repressor activity. Surprisingly, HDAC4 stimulates AP1 activity by activating the MAP kinase cascade. We present evidence that HDAC4 binds and promotes the deacetylation and activation of a key MAP3 kinase, MEKK2. Our findings establish an HDAC4-MAPK-AP1 signaling axis essential for neurogenic muscle atrophy and uncover a direct crosstalk between acetylation- and phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades.

Abstract: Summary
Central to the chaperone function of Hsp70s is the transition between open and closed conformations of their polypeptide substrate binding domain (SBD), which is regulated through an allosteric mechanism via ATP binding and hydrolysis in their nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Although the structure of the closed conformation of Hsp70s is well studied, the open conformation has remained elusive. Here, we report on the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the ATP-bound open conformation of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homolog DnaK. In the open DnaK structure, the β sheet and α-helical lid subdomains of the SBD are detached from one another and docked to different faces of the NBD. The contacts between the β sheet subdomain and the NBD reveal the mechanism of allosteric regulation. In addition, we demonstrate that docking of the β sheet and α-helical lid subdomains to the NBD is a sequential process influenced by peptide and protein substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Arf GTPases are key regulators of both retrograde and anterograde traffic at the Golgi complex. The Golgi-localized Arf activators, Arf-GEFs (guanine exchange factor) of the BIG/GBF family, are poorly understood in terms of both their regulatory and localization mechanisms. We have performed a detailed kinetic characterization of a functional Golgi Arf-GEF, the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized Sec7 protein from yeast. We demonstrate that Sec7 is regulated by both autoinhibition and positive feedback. We show that positive feedback arises through the stable recruitment of Sec7 to membranes via its HDS1 domain by interaction with its product, activated Arf1. This interaction mediates localization of Sec7 to the TGN, because deletion of the HDS1 domain or mutation of the HDS1 domain in combination with deletion of Arf1 significantly increases cytoplasmic localization of Sec7. Our results lead us to propose a model in which Arf-GEF recruitment is linked to Golgi maturation via Arf1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
PCNA is a key component of DNA replication and repair machineries. DNA damage-induced PCNA ubiquitylation serves as a molecular mark to orchestrate postreplication repair. Here, we have identified and characterized Spartan, a protein that specifically recognizes ubiquitylated PCNA and plays an important role in cellular resistance to UV radiation. In vitro, Spartan engages ubiquitylated PCNA via both a PIP box and a UBZ domain. In cells, Spartan is recruited to sites of UV damage in a manner dependent upon the PIP box, the UBZ domain, and PCNA ubiquitylation. Furthermore, Spartan colocalizes and interacts with Rad18, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that modifies PCNA. Surprisingly, while Spartan is recruited by ubiquitylated PCNA, knockdown of Spartan compromised chromatin association of Rad18, monoubiquitylation of PCNA, and localization of Pol η to UV damage. Thus, as a “reader” of ubiquitylated PCNA, Spartan promotes an unexpected feed-forward loop to enhance PCNA ubiquitylation and translesion DNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
The glucose transporter type 4 (glut4) is critical for metabolic homeostasis. Insulin regulates glut4 by modulating its expression on the cell surface. This regulation is mainly achieved by targeting the endocytic recycling of glut4. We identify general receptor for 3-phosphoinositides 1 (Grp1) as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) that promotes glut4 vesicle formation. Grp1 also promotes the later steps of glut4 recycling through ARF6. Insulin signaling regulates Grp1 through phosphorylation by Akt. We also find that mutations that mimic constitutive phosphorylation of Grp1 can bypass upstream insulin signaling to induce glut4 recycling. Thus, we have uncovered a major mechanism by which insulin regulates glut4 recycling. Our findings also reveal the complexity by which a single small GTPase in vesicular transport can coordinate its multiple steps to accomplish a round of transport.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy protects cellular homeostasis by capturing cytosolic components and invading pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy receptors target cargo to autophagy by binding ATG8 on autophagosomal membranes. The expansion of the ATG8 family in higher eukaryotes suggests that specific interactions with autophagy receptors facilitate differential cargo handling. However, selective interactors of ATG8 orthologs are unknown. Here we show that the selectivity of the autophagy receptor NDP52 for LC3C is crucial for innate immunity since cells lacking either protein cannot protect their cytoplasm against Salmonella. LC3C is required for antibacterial autophagy because in its absence the remaining ATG8 orthologs do not support efficient antibacterial autophagy. Structural analysis revealed that the selectivity of NDP52 for LC3C is conferred by a noncanonical LIR, in which lack of an aromatic residue is balanced by LC3C-specific interactions. Our report illustrates that specificity in the interaction between autophagy receptors and autophagy machinery is of functional importance to execute selective autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
During evolution segments of homeothermic genomes underwent a GC content increase. Our analyses reveal that two exon-intron architectures have evolved from an ancestral state of low GC content exons flanked by short introns with a lower GC content. One group underwent a GC content elevation that abolished the differential exon-intron GC content, with introns remaining short. The other group retained the overall low GC content as well as the differential exon-intron GC content, and is associated with longer introns. We show that differential exon-intron GC content regulates exon inclusion level in this group, in which disease-associated mutations often lead to exon skipping. This group's exons also display higher nucleosome occupancy compared to flanking introns and exons of the other group, thus “marking” them for spliceosomal recognition. Collectively, our results reveal that differential exon-intron GC content is a previously unidentified determinant of exon selection and argue that the two GC content architectures reflect the two mechanisms by which splicing signals are recognized: exon definition and intron definition.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionarily ancient arm of the E2f family of transcription factors consisting of the two atypical members E2f7 and E2f8 is essential for murine embryonic development. However, the critical tissues, cellular processes, and molecular pathways regulated by these two factors remain unknown. Using a series of fetal and placental lineage-specific cre mice, we show that E2F7/E2F8 functions in extraembryonic trophoblast lineages are both necessary and sufficient to carry fetuses to term. Expression profiling and biochemical approaches exposed the canonical E2F3a activator as a key family member that antagonizes E2F7/E2F8 functions. Remarkably, the concomitant loss of E2f3a normalized placental gene expression programs, corrected placental defects, and fostered the survival of E2f7/E2f8-deficient embryos to birth. In summary, we identified a placental transcriptional network tightly coordinated by activation and repression through two distinct arms of the E2F family that is essential for extraembryonic cell proliferation, placental development, and fetal viability.

Abstract: Summary
The compartmental organization of eukaryotic cells is maintained dynamically by vesicular trafficking. SNARE proteins play a crucial role in intracellular membrane fusion and need to be targeted to their proper donor or acceptor membrane. The molecular mechanisms that allow for the secretory vesicles carrying the v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7 to leave the cell center, load onto microtubules, and reach the periphery to mediate exocytosis are largely unknown. Here, we show that the TI-VAMP/VAMP7 partner Varp, a Rab21 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with GolginA4 and the kinesin 1 Kif5A. Activated Rab21-GTP in turn binds to MACF1, an actin and microtubule regulator, which is itself a partner of GolginA4. These components are required for directed movement of TI-VAMP/VAMP7 vesicles from the cell center to the cell periphery. The molecular mechanisms uncovered here suggest an integrated view of the transport of vesicles carrying a specific v-SNARE toward the cell surface.

Abstract: Summary
Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial-specific member of the TGF-β/BMP receptor family that is inactivated in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). How ALK1 signaling regulates angiogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ALK1 inhibits angiogenesis by cooperating with the Notch pathway. Blocking Alk1 signaling during postnatal development in mice leads to retinal hypervascularization and the appearance of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Combined blockade of Alk1 and Notch signaling further exacerbates hypervascularization, whereas activation of Alk1 by its high-affinity ligand BMP9 rescues hypersprouting induced by Notch inhibition. Mechanistically, ALK1-dependent SMAD signaling synergizes with activated Notch in stalk cells to induce expression of the Notch targets HEY1 and HEY2, thereby repressing VEGF signaling, tip cell formation, and endothelial sprouting. Taken together, these results uncover a direct link between ALK1 and Notch signaling during vascular morphogenesis that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HHT vascular lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) arises from Barrett esophagus (BE), intestinal-like columnar metaplasia linked to reflux esophagitis. In a transgenic mouse model of BE, esophageal overexpression of interleukin-1β phenocopies human pathology with evolution of esophagitis, Barrett-like metaplasia and EAC. Histopathology and gene signatures closely resembled human BE, with upregulation of TFF2, Bmp4, Cdx2, Notch1, and IL-6. The development of BE and EAC was accelerated by exposure to bile acids and/or nitrosamines, and inhibited by IL-6 deficiency. Lgr5+ gastric cardia stem cells present in BE were able to lineage trace the early BE lesion. Our data suggest that BE and EAC arise from gastric progenitors due to a tumor-promoting IL-1β-IL-6 signaling cascade and Dll1-dependent Notch signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk between intracellular signalling pathways is a functionally important and widespread phenomenon in cell physiology across phyla. In the salivary gland of the blowfly, serotonin induces fluid secretion via parallel activation of both the InsP3/Ca2+ and the cAMP/PKA signalling pathways, which interact on multiple levels. We have determined the molecular identity of a link between both pathways that mediates a Ca2+-dependent rise of intracellular cAMP. Whereas hydrolysis of cAMP via phosphodiesterases is largely independent of Ca2+, cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclases (AC) is potentiated in a Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM)-dependent manner. The existence of a Ca2+/CaM-dependent AC is supported by physiological data and a molecular approach. We have cloned Cv rutabaga cDNA, encoding the first blowfly AC, and confirmed its expression in the salivary gland via reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction. The putative gene product of Cv rutabaga is a Ca2+/CaM-dependent type I AC and shows highest homology to Rutabaga from Drosophila. Thus, a Ca2+/CaM-dependent AC serves as a link between the InsP3/Ca2+ and the cAMP/PKA signalling pathways in the salivary gland of the blowfly and might be important for the amplification and optimization of the secretory response.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that membrane lipids regulate protein networking by directly interacting with protein-interaction domains (PIDs). As a pilot study to identify and functionally annodate lipid-binding PIDs on a genomic scale, we performed experimental and computational studies of PDZ domains. Characterization of 70 PDZ domains showed that ∼40% had submicromolar membrane affinity. Using a computational model built from these data, we predicted the membrane-binding properties of 2,000 PDZ domains from 20 species. The accuracy of the prediction was experimentally validated for 26 PDZ domains. We also subdivided lipid-binding PDZ domains into three classes based on the interplay between membrane- and protein-binding sites. For different classes of PDZ domains, lipid binding regulates their protein interactions by different mechanisms. Functional studies of a PDZ domain protein, rhophilin 2, suggest that all classes of lipid-binding PDZ domains serve as genuine dual-specificity modules regulating protein interactions at the membrane under physiological conditions.

Abstract: Energy supply is the most prominent function of mitochondria, but in addition, mitochondria are indispensable for a multitude of other important cellular functions including calcium (Ca2+) signaling and buffering, the supply of metabolites and the sequestration of apoptotic factors. The efficiency of those functions highly depends on the proper positioning of mitochondria within the cytosol. In lymphocytes, mitochondria preferentially localize into the vicinity (∼200nm) of the immune synapse (IS). This localization is regulated by motor-based cytoskeleton-mediated transport, the fusion/fission dynamics of mitochondria, and probably also through tethering with the ER. IS formation also induces the accumulation of CRAC/ORAI1 Ca2+ channels, the CRAC/ORAI channel activator STIM1, K+ channels and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) within the IS. Such a large agglomeration of Ca2+ binding organelles and proteins highlights the IS as a critical cellular compartment for Ca2+ dependent lymphocyte activation. At the IS, Ca2+ microdomains generated beneath open CRAC/ORAI channels provide a rapid, robust and reliable mechanism for driving cellular responses in mast cells and T cells. Here, we discuss the relevance of motor-based mitochondrial transport, fusion, fission and tethering for mitochondrial localization in T cells and the importance of subplasmalemmal mitochondria to control local CRAC/ORAI1-dependent Ca2+ microdomains at the IS for efficient T lymphocyte activation.

Abstract: Summary
The BLM helicase has been shown to maintain genome stability by preventing accumulation of aberrant recombination intermediates. We show here that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLM ortholog, Sgs1, plays an integral role in normal meiotic recombination, beyond its documented activity limiting aberrant recombination intermediates. In wild-type meiosis, temporally and mechanistically distinct pathways produce crossover and noncrossover recombinants. Crossovers form late in meiosis I prophase, by polo kinase-triggered resolution of Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates. Noncrossovers form earlier, via processes that do not involve stable HJ intermediates. In contrast, sgs1 mutants abolish early noncrossover formation. Instead, both noncrossovers and crossovers form by late HJ intermediate resolution, using an alternate pathway requiring the overlapping activities of Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1-Slx4, nucleases with minor roles in wild-type meiosis. We conclude that Sgs1 is a primary regulator of recombination pathway choice during meiosis and suggest a similar function in the mitotic cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeric heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast requires the RNAi pathway. Chp1, a chromodomain (CD) protein, forms the Ago1-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and recruits siRNA-bound RITS to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) via its CD. Here, we show that the CD of Chp1 (Chp1-CD) possesses unique nucleic acid-binding activities that are essential for heterochromatic gene silencing. Detailed electrophoretic-mobility shift analyses demonstrated that Chp1 binds to RNA via the CD in addition to its central RNA-recognition motif. Interestingly, robust RNA- and DNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD was strongly enhanced when it was bound to H3K9me, which was revealed to involve a positively charged domain within the Chp1-CD by structural analyses. These results demonstrate a role for the CD that provides a link between RNA, DNA, and methylated histone tails to ensure heterochromatic gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
The advent of reprogramming and its impact on stem cell biology has renewed interest in lineage restriction in mammalian embryos, the source of embryonic (ES), epiblast (EpiSC), trophoblast (TS), and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) stem cell lineages. Isolation of specific cell types during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming, and also directly from embryos, is a major technical challenge because few cell-surface proteins are known that can distinguish each cell type. We provide a large-scale proteomic resource of cell-surface proteins for the four embryo-derived stem cell lines. We validated 27 antibodies against lineage-specific cell-surface markers, which enabled investigation of specific cell populations during ES-EpiSC reprogramming and ES-to-XEN differentiation. Identified markers also allowed prospective isolation and characterization of viable lineage progenitors from blastocysts by flow cytometry. These results provide a comprehensive stem cell proteomic resource and enable new approaches to interrogate the mechanisms that regulate cell fate specification.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-RNA interactions are fundamental to core biological processes, such as mRNA splicing, localization, degradation, and translation. We developed a photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced UV crosslinking and oligo(dT) purification approach to identify the mRNA-bound proteome using quantitative proteomics and to display the protein occupancy on mRNA transcripts by next-generation sequencing. Application to a human embryonic kidney cell line identified close to 800 proteins. To our knowledge, nearly one-third were not previously annotated as RNA binding, and about 15% were not predictable by computational methods to interact with RNA. Protein occupancy profiling provides a transcriptome-wide catalog of potential cis-regulatory regions on mammalian mRNAs and showed that large stretches in 3′ UTRs can be contacted by the mRNA-bound proteome, with numerous putative binding sites in regions harboring disease-associated nucleotide polymorphisms. Our observations indicate the presence of a large number of mRNA binders with diverse molecular functions participating in combinatorial posttranscriptional gene-expression networks.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression by promoting degradation or repressing translation of target mRNAs. The components of the miRNA pathway are subject to diverse modifications that can modulate the abundance and function of miRNAs. Iron is essential for fundamental metabolic processes, and its homeostasis is tightly regulated. Here we identified iron chelators as a class of activator of the miRNA pathway that could promote the processing of miRNA precursors. We show that cytosolic iron could regulate the activity of the miRNA pathway through poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2). PCBP2 is associated with Dicer and promotes the processing of miRNA precursors. Cytosolic iron could modulate the association between PCBP2 and Dicer, as well as the multimerization of PCBP2 and its ability to bind to miRNA precursors, which can alter the processing of miRNA precursors. Our findings reveal a role of iron homeostasis in the regulation of miRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory small non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression by binding to gene elements, such as the gene promotor 5’UTR, mainly in the 3’UTR of mRNA. One miRNA targets many mRNAs, which can be regulated by many miRNAs, leading to a complex metabolic network. In our study, we found that the expression level of miR-590-5p is higher in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 than in the normal hepatocellular cell line L02. Downregulation of miR-590-5p inhibited proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). We also showed that expression of TGF-beta RII, which has been regarded as a regulator of tumor proliferation, invasion, and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma, is regulated by miRNA-590-5p. In addition, miR-590-5p downregulated the expression of TGF-beta RII by targeting the 3’UTR of mRNA. We also found that downregulation of miR-590-5p was associated with an elevation of TGF-beta RII and inhibition of proliferation and invasion in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-590-5p was associated with upregulation of TGF-beta RII and could promote proliferation and invasion in L02 cells. In conclusion, we determined that TGF-beta RII is a novel target of miRNA-590-5p. Thus, the role of TGF-beta RII in regulating proliferation and invasion of human HCCs is controlled by miR-590-5p. In other words, miR-590-5p promotes proliferation and invasion in human HCCs by directly targeting TGF-beta RII.

Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is known for its role in the activation of plant defense responses. To examine the involvement and mode of action of NO in plant defense responses, we introduced calmodulin-dependent mammalian neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which controls the CaMV35S promoter, into wild-type and NahG tobacco plants. Constitutive expression of nNOS led to NO production and triggered spontaneous induction of leaf lesions. Transgenic plants accumulated high amounts of H2O2, with catalase activity lower than that in the wild type. nNOS transgenic plants contained high levels of salicylic acid (SA), and they induced an array of SA-, jasmonic acid (JA)-, and/or ethylene (ET)-related genes. Consequently, NahG co-expression blocked the induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-associated genes in transgenic plants, implying SA is involved in NO-mediated induction of SAR genes. The transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to a spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our results suggest a highly ranked regulatory role for NO in SA-, JA-, and/or ET-dependent pathways that lead to disease resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-to-cell communication in embryo sacs is thought to regulate the development of female gametes in flowering plants, but the details remain poorly understood. Here, we report a mitochondrial protein, GAMETE CELL DEFECTIVE 1 (GCD1), enriched in gametophytes that is essential for final maturation of female gametes. Using Arabidopsis gcd1 mutants, we found that final maturation of the egg and central cells is not required for double fertilization but is necessary for embryogenesis initiation and endosperm development. Furthermore, nonautonomous effects, observed when GCD1 or AAC2 function is disrupted, suggest that mitochondrial function influences reciprocal signaling between central and egg cells to regulate maturation of the partner (egg or central) cell. Our findings confirm that cell-to-cell communication is important in functional maturation of female gametic cells and suggest that both egg and central cells sense and transmit their mitochondrial metabolic status as an important cue that regulates the coordination of gamete maturation.

Abstract: Summary
The functional role of pericytes in cancer progression remains unknown. Clinical studies suggest that low numbers of vessel-associated pericytes correlated with a drop in overall survival of patients with invasive breast cancer. Using genetic mouse models or pharmacological inhibitors, pericyte depletion suppressed tumor growth but enhanced metastasis. Pericyte depletion was further associated with increased hypoxia, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and Met receptor activation. Silencing of Twist or use of a Met inhibitor suppressed hypoxia and EMT/Met-driven metastasis. In addition, poor pericyte coverage coupled with high Met expression in cancer cells speculates the worst prognosis for patients with invasive breast cancer. Collectively, our study suggests that pericytes within the primary tumor microenvironment likely serve as important gatekeepers against cancer progression and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutive Kras and NF-κB activation is identified as signature alterations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, how NF-κB is activated in PDAC is not yet understood. Here, we report that pancreas-targeted IKK2/β inactivation inhibited NF-κB activation and PDAC development in KrasG12D and KrasG12D;Ink4a/ArfF/F mice, demonstrating a mechanistic link between IKK2/β and KrasG12D in PDAC inception. Our findings reveal that KrasG12D-activated AP-1 induces IL-1α, which, in turn, activates NF-κB and its target genes IL-1α and p62, to initiate IL-1α/p62 feedforward loops for inducing and sustaining NF-κB activity. Furthermore, IL-1α overexpression correlates with Kras mutation, NF-κB activity, and poor survival in PDAC patients. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the mechanism by which IKK2/β/NF-κB is activated by KrasG12D through dual feedforward loops of IL-1α/p62.

Abstract: In this study, the morphology and ultrastructure of the foot of Tegillarca granosa was compared with the bivalves from different habitats. The sediment of habitat of T. granosa is mostly a mixture of sand (68.93%) and mud (24.12%). The foot is wedge-shaped with multiple projections on the surface and covered with ciliary tufts. The epithelial layer is simple and composed of ciliated columnar epithelia and mucous cells. Although the mucous cells are distributed mostly in the epithelial layer, they are developed even in the connective tissues and muscle layers, and the mucous cells mostly contain acidic carboxylated mucosubstances. From the TEM observation, secretory cells are classified into three types. Type A secretory cell has a goblet form and is most widely distributed among the three types. Type B secretory cell has an oval form and the secretory granule has fibrous substance. Type C secretory cell has an elongated elliptic form and membrane-bounded secretory granules. The muscle fiber bundles are composed mainly of smooth muscle fibers. The smooth muscle fibers can be divided into two types. Type A muscle fibers have evenly distributed thick microfilaments between the thin microfilaments of cytoplasm. Type B muscle fiber has cluster of condensed microfilaments in the medulla cytoplasm while the cortical cytoplasm has loose distribution of thin microfilaments.

Abstract: Secreted proteins are known to have multiple roles in plant development, metabolism, and stress response. In a previous study to understand the roles of secreted proteins, Capsicum annuum secreted proteins (CaS) were isolated by yeast secretion trap. Among the secreted proteins, we further characterized Capsicum annuum senescence-delaying 1 (CaSDI), a gene encoding a novel secreted protein that is present only in the genus Capsicum. The deduced CaSD1 contains multiple repeats of the amino acid sequence KPPIHNHKPTDYDRS. Interestingly, the number of repeats varied among cultivars and species in the Capsicum genus. CaSD1 is constitutively expressed in roots, and Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression of CaSD1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves resulted in delayed senescence with a dramatically increased number of trichomes and enlarged epidermal cells. Furthermore, senescence- and cell division-related genes were differentially regulated by CaSD1-overexpressing plants. These observations imply that the pepper-specific cell wall protein CaSD1 plays roles in plant growth and development by regulating cell division and differentiation.

Abstract: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in brain function and neurological diseases. Adult neural progenitor cell (aNPC) proliferation is a critical first step in hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms that modulate aNPC proliferation have not been fully identified. Ample evidence has demonstrated that cell proliferation is dependent on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. We hypothesized that store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs), which are ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, participate in aNPC proliferation. We found that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) was involved in the proliferation of aNPCs and that 2-APB, Gd3+ and SKF96365, antagonists of SOCE and canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC), respectively, inhibited the increase in SOCE and aNPC proliferation. We therefore analyzed the expression of TRPCs in aNPCs and showed that TRPC1 is the most significantly upregulated member under proliferative conditions. Interestingly, knockdown of TRPC1 and using an antibody against TRPC1 markedly reduced the degree of SOCE and aNPC proliferation. In parallel, we observed the suppression of aNPC proliferation was found to be associated with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, gene expression microarray analysis revealed a selective up- or downregulation of 10 genes in aNPCs following TRPC1 silencing. Knockdown of Orai1 or STIM1 also induced a significant inhibition of SOCE and proliferation in aNPCs, and all three proteins were colocalized in the plasma membrane region of cells. Together, these results indicate that SOCE represents a principal mechanism regulating the proliferation of aNPCs and that TRPC1 is an essential component of this pathway. This discovery may be important in improving adult hippocampal neurogenesis and treating cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that mediates diverse biological processes. However, the mechanisms by which the intracellular signals of TGF-β1 are terminated are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that DRAK2 serves as a TGF-β1-inducible antagonist of TGF-β signaling. TGF-β1 stimulation rapidly induces DRAK2 expression and enhances endogenous interaction of the type I TGF-β receptor with DRAK2, thereby blocking R-Smads recruitment. Depletion of DRAK2 expression markedly augmented the intensity and the extent of TGF-β1 responses. Furthermore, a high level of DRAK2 expression was observed in basal-like and HER2-enriched breast tumors and cell lines, and depletion of DRAK2 expression suppressed the tumorigenic ability of breast cancer cells. Thus, these studies define a function for DRAK2 as an intrinsic intracellular antagonist participating in the negative feedback loop to control TGF-β1 responses, and aberrant expression of DRAK2 increases tumorigenic potential, in part, through the inhibition of TGF-β1 tumor suppressor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Discovering how histone variants that mark distinct chromatin regions affect a developmental program is a major challenge in the epigenetics field. To assess the importance of the H3.3 histone variant and its dedicated histone chaperone HIRA, we used an established developmental model, Xenopus laevis. After the early rapid divisions exploiting a large maternal pool of both replicative H3.2 and replacement H3.3, H3.3 transcripts show a distinct peak of expression at gastrulation. Depletion of both H3.2 and H3.3 leads to an early gastrulation arrest. However, with only H3.3 depletion, defects occur at late gastrulation, impairing further development. Providing exogenous H3.3 mRNAs, but not replicative H3.2 mRNAs, rescues these defects. Notably, downregulation of the H3.3 histone chaperone HIRA similarly impairs late gastrulation, and we find a global defect in H3.3 incorporation into chromatin comparable to H3.3 depletion. We discuss how specific HIRA-dependent H3.3 deposition is required for chromatin dynamics during gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
Multisite phosphorylation plays an important role in biological oscillators such as the circadian clock. Its general role, however, has been elusive. In this theoretical study, we show that a simple substrate with two modification sites acted upon by two opposing enzymes (e.g., a kinase and a phosphatase) can show oscillations in its modification state. An unbiased computational analysis of this oscillator reveals two common characteristics: a unidirectional modification cycle and sequestering of an enzyme by a specific modification state. These two motifs cause a substrate to act as a coupled system in which a unidirectional cycle generates single-molecule oscillators, whereas sequestration synchronizes the population by limiting the available enzyme under conditions in which substrate is in excess. We also demonstrate the conditions under which the oscillation period is temperature compensated, an important feature of the circadian clock. This theoretical model will provide a framework for analyzing and synthesizing posttranslational oscillators.

Abstract: Summary
To gain insight into the interplay of processes and species that maintain a correctly folded, functional proteome, we have developed a computational model called FoldEco. FoldEco models the cellular proteostasis network of the E. coli cytoplasm, including protein synthesis, degradation, aggregation, chaperone systems, and the folding characteristics of protein clients. We focused on E. coli because much of the needed input information—including mechanisms, rate parameters, and equilibrium coefficients—is available, largely from in vitro experiments; however, FoldEco will shed light on proteostasis in other organisms. FoldEco can generate hypotheses to guide the design of new experiments. Hypothesis generation leads to system-wide questions and shows how to convert these questions to experimentally measurable quantities, such as changes in protein concentrations with chaperone or protease levels, which can then be used to improve our current understanding of proteostasis and refine the model. A web version of FoldEco is available at http://foldeco.scripps.edu.

Abstract: Summary
Using a mouse model of human MLL-AF9 leukemia, we identified the lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A (LSD1 or AOF2) as an essential regulator of leukemia stem cell (LSC) potential. KDM1A acts at genomic loci bound by MLL-AF9 to sustain expression of the associated oncogenic program, thus preventing differentiation and apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic targeting of KDM1A using tranylcypromine analogs active in the nanomolar range phenocopied Kdm1a knockdown in both murine and primary human AML cells exhibiting MLL translocations. By contrast, the clonogenic and repopulating potential of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was spared. Our data establish KDM1A as a key effector of the differentiation block in MLL leukemia, which may be selectively targeted to therapeutic effect.

Although the capacity to initiate tumors upon serial transplantation is a hallmark of all C-ICs, little is known about the genes that control this process. Here, we establish that ID1 and ID3 function together to govern colon cancer-initiating cell (CC-IC) self-renewal through cell-cycle restriction driven by the cell-cycle inhibitor p21. Regulation of p21 by ID1 and ID3 is a central mechanism preventing the accumulation of excess DNA damage and subsequent functional exhaustion of CC-ICs. Additionally, silencing of ID1 and ID3 increases sensitivity of CC-ICs to the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, linking tumor initiation function with chemotherapy resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) are characterized by a robust fibroinflammatory response. We show here that this desmoplastic reaction generates inordinately high interstitial fluid pressures (IFPs), exceeding those previously measured or theorized for solid tumors, and induces vascular collapse, while presenting substantial barriers to perfusion, diffusion, and convection of small molecule therapeutics. We identify hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA), as the primary matrix determinant of these barriers and show that systemic administration of an enzymatic agent can ablate stromal HA from autochthonous murine PDA, normalize IFP, and re-expand the microvasculature. In combination with the standard chemotherapeutic, gemcitabine, the treatment permanently remodels the tumor microenvironment and consistently achieves objective tumor responses, resulting in a near doubling of overall survival.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian embryonic stem cells, the acquisition of pluripotency is dependent on Nanog, but the in vivo analysis of Nanog has been hampered by its requirement for early mouse development. In an effort to examine the role of Nanog in vivo, we identified a zebrafish Nanog ortholog and found that its knockdown impaired endoderm formation. Genome-wide transcription analysis revealed that nanog-like morphants fail to develop the extraembryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL), which produces Nodal, required for endoderm induction. We examined the genes that were regulated by Nanog-like and identified the homeobox gene mxtx2, which is both necessary and sufficient for YSL induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and genetic studies indicated that Nanog-like directly activates mxtx2, which, in turn, specifies the YSL lineage by directly activating YSL genes. Our study identifies a Nanog-like-Mxtx2-Nodal pathway and establishes a role for Nanog-like in regulating the formation of the extraembryonic tissue required for endoderm induction.

Abstract: H2S is a signaling molecule associated with protection against vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. This protection involves the stimulation of vasorelaxation, but other possible contributing mechanisms have not been extensively explored. In this study, we found that the vascular H2S-producing enzyme, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), was down-regulated by oscillatory shear stress (OSS) among various vaso-regulators. Consistently, NaHS, an H2S donor, appeared to inhibit OSS-induced THP-1 cell adhesion. We also found that NaHS activated the nitric oxide (NO)-producing Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway in response to OSS, whereas NaHS had no effect on IκB, a well-known molecule regulating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Moreover, NaHS increased OSS-dependent eNOS expression and decreased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an eNOS inhibitor, abrogated the inhibitory effects of NaHS on OSS-induced endothelial ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. These data suggest that down-regulation of CSE resulting in decreased levels of H2S is a key factor for OSS-associated atherogenesis and further suggest that regulation of H2S production can be a potential target for preventing cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitination plays a major role in protein degradation. Although phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination is well known for the regulation of protein stability, methylation-dependent ubiquitination machinery has not been characterized. Here, we provide evidence that methylation-dependent ubiquitination is carried out by damage-specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1)/cullin4 (CUL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and a DDB1-CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1) adaptor, which recognizes monomethylated substrates. Molecular modeling and binding affinity studies reveal that the putative chromo domain of DCAF1 directly recognizes monomethylated substrates, whereas critical binding pocket mutations of the DCAF1 chromo domain ablated the binding from the monomethylated substrates. Further, we discovered that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) methyltransferase has distinct substrate specificities for histone H3K27 and nonhistones exemplified by an orphan nuclear receptor, RORα. We propose that EZH2-DCAF1/DDB1/CUL4 represents a previously unrecognized methylation-dependent ubiquitination machinery specifically recognizing “methyl degron”; through this, nonhistone protein stability can be dynamically regulated in a methylation-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
The regulatory networks of differentiation programs have been partly characterized; however, the molecular mechanisms of lineage-specific gene regulation by highly similar transcription factors remain largely unknown. Here we compare the genome-wide binding and transcription profiles of NEUROD2-mediated neurogenesis with MYOD-mediated myogenesis. We demonstrate that NEUROD2 and MYOD bind a shared CAGCTG E box motif and E box motifs specific for each factor: CAGGTG for MYOD and CAGATG for NEUROD2. Binding at factor-specific motifs is associated with gene transcription, whereas binding at shared sites is associated with regional epigenetic modifications but is not as strongly associated with gene transcription. Binding is largely constrained to E boxes preset in an accessible chromatin context that determines the set of target genes activated in each cell type. These findings demonstrate that the differentiation program is genetically determined by E box sequence, whereas cell lineage epigenetically determines the availability of E boxes for each differentiation program.

Abstract: Summary
We have used Drosophila ovarian follicle stem cells (FSCs) to study how stem cells are regulated by external signals and draw three main conclusions. First, the spatial definition of supportive niche positions for FSCs depends on gradients of Hh and JAK-STAT pathway ligands, which emanate from opposite, distant sites. FSC position may be further refined by a preference for low-level Wnt signaling. Second, hyperactivity of supportive signaling pathways can compensate for the absence of the otherwise essential adhesion molecule, DE-cadherin, suggesting a close regulatory connection between niche adhesion and niche signals. Third, FSC behavior is determined largely by summing the inputs of multiple signaling pathways of unequal potencies. Altogether, our findings indicate that a stem cell niche need not be defined by short-range signals and invariant cell contacts; rather, for FSCs, the intersection of gradients of long-range niche signals regulates the longevity, position, number, and competitive behavior of stem cells.

Abstract: Tracking of transplanted cells has become an important procedure in cell therapy. We studied the in vitro dye retention, survival and in vivo tracking of stem cells with PKH26 dye. Sheep BMSCs and ADSCs were labeled with 2, 4 and 8μmol of PKH26 and monitored for six passages. Labeled BMSCs and ADSCs acquired mean cumulative population doubling of 12.7±0.4 and 14.6±0.5; unlabeled samples had 13.8±0.5 and 15.4±0.6 respectively. Upon staining with 2, 4 and 8μmol PKH26, BMSCs had retentions of 40.0±5.8, 60.0±2.9 and 95.0±2.9%, while ADSCs had 92.0±1.2, 95.0±1.2 and 98.0±1.2%. ADSCs retentions were significantly higher at 2 and 4μmol. On dye retention comparison at 8μmol and 4μmol for BMSCs and ADSCs; ADSCs were significantly higher at passages 2 and 3. The viability of BMSCs reduced from 94.0±1.2% to 90.0±0.6% and ADSCs from 94.0±1.2% to 52.0±1.2% (p<0.05) after 24h. BMSCs had significant up regulation of the cartilage genes for both the labeled and the unlabeled samples compared to ADSCs (p<0.05). PKH26 fluorescence was detected on the resected portions of the regenerated neo-cartilage. The recommended concentration of PKH26 for ADSCs is 2μmol and BMSCs is 8μmol, and they can be tracked up to 49 days.
