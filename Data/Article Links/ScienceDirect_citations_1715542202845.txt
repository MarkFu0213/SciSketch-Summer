Abstract: Bacterial cytokinesis is commonly initiated by the Z-ring, a dynamic cytoskeletal structure that assembles at the site of division. Its primary component is FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, that like its eukaryotic relative forms protein filaments in the presence of GTP. Since the discovery of the Z-ring 25years ago, various models for the role of FtsZ have been suggested. However, important information about the architecture and dynamics of FtsZ filaments during cytokinesis is still missing. One reason for this lack of knowledge has been the small size of bacteria, which has made it difficult to resolve the orientation and dynamics of individual FtsZ filaments in the Z-ring. While superresolution microscopy experiments have helped to gain more information about the organization of the Z-ring in the dividing cell, they were not yet able to elucidate a mechanism of how FtsZ filaments reorganize during assembly and disassembly of the Z-ring. In this chapter, we explain how to use an in vitro reconstitution approach to investigate the self-organization of FtsZ filaments recruited to a biomimetic lipid bilayer by its membrane anchor FtsA. We show how to perform single-molecule experiments to study the behavior of individual FtsZ monomers during the constant reorganization of the FtsZ-FtsA filament network. We describe how to analyze the dynamics of single molecules and explain why this information can help to shed light onto possible mechanism of Z-ring constriction. We believe that similar experimental approaches will be useful to study the mechanism of membrane-based polymerization of other cytoskeletal systems, not only from prokaryotic but also eukaryotic origin.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common and life threatening inherited blood disorder, affecting over 300,000 newborns per year. Over 75% of SCD births occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where the lack of timely and accurate diagnosis results in premature death within the first few years of life for a majority of affected infants. Current methods to diagnosis SCD require expensive laboratory equipment and reagents, and adequately trained laboratory personnel. In addition, test results are often delayed due to transport and batching of samples in a central laboratory. Financial and technical limitations often preclude any form of SCD laboratory testing at the local level in regions where SCD is most prevalent. There has been a recent surge of interest in addressing the global burden of SCD, including improving and optimizing diagnostic capacities. Largely stimulated by a funding opportunity from the NIH, several point-of-care diagnostics have been developed for SCD with a focus on developing devices that are inexpensive, simple, and practical in limited resource settings. In this manuscript, we review the global burden of SCA, including the rationale for the development of POC assays, and carefully review the POC devices currently in development.

Abstract: Hydroxyurea is the primary pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA). Accumulated clinical experience across multiple age ranges has suggested that the use of an individualized maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will achieve optimal benefit of hydroxyurea treatment. However, the current empirical and trial-and-error approach for dose escalation often results in a lengthy titration process and is not strictly implemented in many clinics. Opportunities exist for pharmacokinetics model-based precision dosing of hydroxyurea to quickly achieve individual MTD. This review intends to introduce the use of a quantitative modeling approach including a Bayesian adaptive control strategy for the precision dosing of hydroxyurea. The rationale and practical considerations for the implementation of this approach are discussed. Future research directions with a focus on integrating specific safety and other clinical outcome endpoints into dose selection decision making are also discussed.

Abstract: Despite sickle cell disease (SCD) first being reported >100years ago and molecularly characterized >50years ago, patients continue to experience severe morbidity and early mortality. Although there have been substantial clinical advances with immunizations, penicillin prophylaxis, hydroxyurea treatment, and transfusion therapy, the only cure that can be offered is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this work, we summarize the various allogeneic curative approaches reported to date and discuss open and upcoming clinical research protocols. Then we consider gene therapy and gene editing strategies that may enable cure based on autologous HSCs.

Abstract: We describe the general occurrence in animal cells of elastic components (“tethers”) that connect individual chromosomes moving to opposite poles during anaphase. Tethers, originally described in crane-fly spermatocytes, exert force on chromosome arms opposite to the direction the anaphase chromosomes move. We show that they exist in a broad range of animal cells. Thus tethers are previously unrecognised components of general mitotic mechanisms that exert force on chromosomes and they need to be accounted for in general models of mitosis in terms of forces on chromosomes and in terms of what their roles might be.

Abstract: The proper positioning of microtubule (MT) asters underlies fundamental processes such as nuclear centration, cell polarity, division positioning, and embryogenesis. In large eggs and early blastomeres, MT asters may exhibit long range motions with atypical speed and precision to target their functional position. The biophysical mechanisms regulating such motions remain however largely unknown. The centration of sperm asters in sea urchin embryos is a stereotypical example of such aster long range motion. In this chapter, we describe methods developed in this system to (1) quantify sperm aster 3-D motion with confocal microscopy and automated image analysis and (2) severe a portion of astral MTs with a UV laser. These methods may serve as a template to dissect the generic mechanisms of aster motion and force production in other embryos and cell types.

Abstract: The application of genomic approaches is impacting all areas of laboratory testing including transfusion medicine. Use of DNA-based test methods is particularly applicable for red cell and platelet antigen typing as the majority of genes encoding the carrier proteins and carbohydrates are now known and were cloned in the 1990′s. Many of the antigenic polymorphisms are due to single nucleotide changes (SNP's) in the respective genes and DNA-arrays that target these changes have been validated by comparison with conventional serologic typing. Here we review the advances in the last decade in the application of DNA-based genotyping to transfusion therapy, specifically in sickle cell anemia (SCA), and discuss the practical integration and the value of this approach to improve outcomes and prevent complications in this patient population. The ability to test for antigens for which there are no serologic reagents is a major medical advance that promises to mitigate transfusion related morbidity and mortality due to alloimmunization.

Abstract: The present study investigated cerebral and muscle hemoglobin oxygen saturation (tissue oxygen index, TOI) in children with sickle cell anemia (SS), sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (SC) and healthy children (AA). TOI was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and spectral analysis of the TOI variability was used to assess flowmotion and vasomotion. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), hemorheological and hematological parameters were also measured in SS and SC children. Both TOI were lower in SS compared to both AA and SC children, with SC exhibiting lower values than AA children. Cerebral vasomotion expressed in absolute values was enhanced in SS compared to AA and SC children. Muscle vasomotion did not differ between the three groups. Hematocrit, SpO2 and red blood cell deformability were positively associated with cerebral TOI in SS children. We demonstrated that 1) cerebral and muscle TOI were markedly decreased in SS children while the decrease of TOI was milder in SC children, 2) cerebral TOI level was associated with several biological markers in SS children only and 3) cerebral vasomotion was enhanced in SS, possibly to counterbalance the effects of chronic cerebral hypoxia.

Abstract: Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine leiomyomas, are a benign tumor of the human uterus and the commonest estrogen-dependent benign tumor found in women. Myocardin is an important transcriptional regulator in smooth and cardiac muscle development. The role of myocardin and its relationship with ERα in uterine fibroids have barely been addressed. We noticed that the expression of myocardin was markedly reduced in human uterine fibroid tissue compared with corresponding normal or adjacent myometrium tissue. Here we reported that myocardin induced the transcription and expression of differentiation markers SM22α and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in rat primary uterine smooth muscle cells (USMCs) and this effect was inhibited by ERα. Notably, we showed that, ERα induced expression of proliferation markers PCNA and ki-67 in rat primary USMCs. We also found ERα interacted with myocardin and formed complex to bind to CArG box and inhibit the SM22α promoter activity. Furthermore, ERα inhibited the transcription and expression of myocardin, and reduced the levels of transcription and expression of downstream target SM22α, a SMC differentiation marker. Our data thus provided important and novel insights into how ERα and myocardin interact to control the cell differentiation and proliferation of USMCs. Thus, it may provide potential therapeutic target for uterine fibroids.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is an essential event in canonical cell division. In multicellular organisms, cells must divide in the context of neighboring cells in intact tissues. Recent studies have shown that tissue architecture can regulate the dynamics of and molecular requirements for cytokinesis. On the other hand, regulated cytokinesis failure occurs in, and is required for the proper function of, certain cell types and tissues including cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and germ lines. One way to build our understanding of cytokinesis in diverse cell types is to visualize cytokinesis in intact tissues. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful system for such inquiries due to the well-characterized, invariant lineage of each of its cells, the ease of genomic modifications including tagging proteins, and many more advantages. The clear cuticle of C. elegans allows for live imaging of intact tissues; however, the worm's motility can confound imaging. Here we introduce two C. elegans tissues, an epithelial tissue and the germ line, both excellent systems for the study of cytokinesis in the context of an intact animal. Additionally, we present three protocols for overcoming the challenges of live imaging in C. elegans.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current status on recommendations or guidelines for primary prophylaxis based on recent published papers from organizations or group of experts as well as some original key papers. A rather uniform view exists that prophylaxis should be initiated at an early age before or after no more than a single joint bleed and, if possible, preferably be continued for life. The dose and dose frequency of prophylaxis is dependent on the goal of treatment, bleeding phenotype, compliance, venous access and economic resources in the health care system and should be tailored individually based on clinical outcome and pharmacokinetics. For children, the effectiveness of prophylaxis is more dependent on maintaining minimum trough levels than in adults. Novel extended half-life products are being introduced, which should not affect the decision on when to start prophylaxis nor the initial dose, but which may be helpful for patients with difficult venous access and which may enable higher trough levels of factor VIII.

Abstract: Centralspindlin is a crucial regulator of animal cytokinesis, consisting of MKLP1 kinesin-6 and CYK4 Rho-family GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP). As a microtubule-bundling protein, it plays a crucial role in the formation of the central spindle. Through distinct accumulation to the antiparallel microtubule overlaps at the central spindle and the midbody, it recruits various downstream factors to the site of cell division as well as anchors the plasma membrane to maintain the narrow intercellular channels between the daughter cells until their final separation (abscission). A unique and functionally important feature of centralspindlin as a kinesin-containing protein complex is that the nonmotor component, CYK4, is not a passive cargo of the MKLP1 motor, but an integrated component of a microtubule-organizing machinery. Thus, for in vitro structural and functional assays, it is pivotal to prepare active stoichiometric complexes of the two components. Discussed here are two complimentary approaches, (1) reconstitution of the complex in bacterial extracts (in extract reconstitution) and (2) purification of a native complex from a mammalian cell line using a localization and affinity purification (LAP) tag.

Abstract: Oxygen is a central molecule in the development of multicellular life, allowing efficient energy generation. Inadequate oxygen supply requires rapid adaptations to prevent cellular damage and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway plays a central role in this adaptation. Numerous diseases and disease processes are influenced by hypoxia and the HIF pathway. One component, von Hippel Lindau (VHL), is a well-known tumor suppressor, which acts at least in part via regulating HIF signaling. The zebrafish has become a central vertebrate model organism in which developmental and disease processes can be studied. In this review, we have tried to bring together knowledge on the HIF/hypoxic signaling pathway in zebrafish, including what is known on VHL functions.

Abstract: Summary
Pentostatin (PTN, deoxycoformycin) and arabinofuranosyladenine (Ara-A, vidarabine) are purine nucleoside antibiotics used clinically to treat hematological cancers and human DNA virus infections, respectively. PTN has a 1,3-diazepine ring, and Ara-A is an adenosine analog with an intriguing epimerization at the C-2′ hydroxyl group. However, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of these interesting molecules has long remained elusive. Here, we report that the biosynthesis of PTN and Ara-A employs an unusual protector-protégé strategy. To our surprise, we determined that a single gene cluster governs PTN and Ara-A biosynthesis via two independent pathways. Moreover, we verified that PenB functions as a reversible oxidoreductase for the final step of PTN. Remarkably, we provided the first direct biochemical evidence that PTN can protect Ara-A from deamination by selective inhibition of the host adenosine deaminase. These findings expand our knowledge of natural product biosynthesis and open the way for target-directed genome mining of Ara-A/PTN-related antibiotics.

Abstract: Whether or not neurogenesis occurs in the adult substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is an important question relevant for developing better treatments for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although controversial, it is generally believed that dividing cells here remain undifferentiated or differentiate into glia, not neurons. However, there is a suggestion that Nestin-expressing neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult SNc have a propensity to differentiate into neurons, which we sought to confirm in the present study. Adult (>8-weeks old) transgenic NesCreERT2/GtROSA or NesCreERT2/R26eYFP mice were used to permanently label Nestin-expressing cells and their progeny with β-galactosidase (β-gal) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), respectively. Most β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells were found in the ependymal lining of the midbrain aqueduct (Aq) and in the midline ventral to Aq. Smaller but significant numbers were in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in SNc. Low-level basal proliferation was evidenced by a modest increase in number of β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells over time, fewer β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells when mice were administered the anti-mitotic agent Cytarabine, and incorporation of the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in a very small number of β-gal+ cells. No evidence of migration was found, including no immunoreactivity against the migration markers doublecortin (DCX) or polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), and no dispersal of β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells through the midbrain parenchyma over time. However, β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells did increase in size and express higher levels of mature neuronal genes over time, indicating growth and neuronal differentiation. In mice whose SNc dopamine neurons had been depleted with 6-hydroxy-dopamine, a model of PD, there were ~2-fold more β-gal+ cells in SNc specifically, although the proportion that were also NeuN+ was not affected. Remarkably, as early as 4days following putative Nestin-expression, many β-gal+ or eYFP+ cells had mature neuronal morphology and were NeuN+. Furthermore, mature neuronal β-gal+ cells were immunoreactive against the self-renewal or pluripotency marker sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2). Overall, our data support the notion that some Nestin-expressing, presumably NPCs, have a limited capacity for proliferation, no capacity for migration, and a propensity to generate new neurons within the microenvironment of the adult midbrain. However, our data also suggest that significant numbers of extant midbrain neurons express Nestin and other classical neurogenesis markers in contexts that are presumably not neurogenic. These findings foreshadow duplicitous roles for Nestin and other molecules that are traditionally associated with neurogenesis in the adult midbrain, which should be considered in future PD research.

Abstract: Cell-type specific variations are typical for the expression of different members of the HSP70 family. In circulating immune cells, HSP70 proteins interact with units of signaling pathways involved in the immune responses and may promote cell survival in sites of inflammation. In this work, we compared basal HSP70 expression and stress-induced HSP70 response in polymorphonuclear and mononuclear human leukocytes. The intracellular content of inducible and constitutive forms of HSP70 was analyzed in relation to the transcriptional activity of HSPA genes. Hyperthermia was used as the stress model for induction of HSP70 synthesis in the cells. Our results demonstrated that granulocytes (mainly neutrophils) and mononuclear cells differ significantly by both basal HSP70 expression and levels of HSP70 induction under hyperthermia. The differences were observed at the levels of HSPA gene transcription and intracellular HSP70 content. The expression of constitutive Hsс70 protein was much higher in mononuclear cells consisting of monocytes and lymphocytes than in granulocytes. At the same time, intact neutrophils showed increased expression of inducible Hsp70 protein compared to mononuclear cells. Heat treatment induced additional expression of HSPA genes in leukocytes. The most pronounced increase in the expression was observed in polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes for HSPA1A/B. However, in granulocytes, the induction of the transcription of the HSPA8 gene encoding the Hsc70 protein was significantly higher than in mononuclear cells. These variations in transcriptional activity of HSPA genes and intracellular HSP70 content in different populations of leukocytes may reflect specified requirements for the chaperone activity in the cells with a distinct functional role in the immune system.

Abstract: Dermatopontin (DPT) is a matricellular protein with cardinal roles in cutaneous wound healing. The protein is also reported to be altered in various anomalies including cancer. The present study is aimed to unravel the role of DPT in angiogenesis which is imperative in many physiological and pathological processes. DPT’s capabilities on promoting angiogenesis were assessed using various in vitro and ex vivo systems. The results indicated that DPT enhances cell motility and induces lamellipodia formation in endothelial cells. Additionally, we noticed that DPT stimulates tube formation in endothelial cells when plated on a matrigel substrate. However, it was observed that DPT had no effect on the proliferation of endothelial cells even at higher concentrations and prolonged treatment periods. Additional experiments on CAM and aortic arch assays apparently depicted that DPT promotes neovascularisation and tube sprouting, thus unraveling its prominent role in angiogenesis. Further, PCR analysis revealed that endothelial cells are devoid of DPT expression, but when exogenously supplied, modulates the expression of transforming growth factor β1 and integrin α3β1 which are reported to have crucial roles in endothelial cell behaviour during angiogenesis. In conclusion, DPT possess vital pro-angiogenic properties and thus retains promising therapeutic values in managing chronic wounds and cancer.

Abstract: PACE4, one of the seven members of the proprotein convertase family, plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer. Therefore, its inhibition has become an attractive target to develop new therapies against this disease. Recently, we have developed a highly potent and selective PACE4 inhibitor, known as the multi-Leu peptide with the following sequence Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH2. Herein, with the aim of improving the stability profile of this inhibitor for potential in vivo application, we investigated the impact of different cyclization strategies. The inhibitory activity of new peptides was tested and compared to their linear counterparts. The potent analogues were further selected for stability evaluation. Our results showed that the cyclization involving a C-terminal carboxylic acid (head-to-tail or side chain-to-tail) led to compounds with significantly diminished inhibitory potency towards PACE4, indicating that an appropriate balance between rigidity and flexibility of the structure is necessary to allow the optimal binding with the enzyme. On the other hand, the modification within a multi-Leu core in combination with the incorporation of a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide (Amba) residue yielded potent cyclic analogues. The best compound derived from this group, (&)[Mpa]LLLC(&)RVK[Amba] (where & indicates cyclization, Mpa – 3-mercaptopropionic acid), exhibited promising overall profile comprising of potent inhibitory effect against PACE4 and prostate cancer cell lines as well as improved stability. We believe that this cyclic framework could be further used to design even more potent and stable PACE4 inhibitors.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequent and deadly malignancy in women worldwide. Despite national screening programs combined with new treatments relapse rate remain high and new therapies are needed. From previous work, we identified PACE4, a member of the proprotein convertase (PCs) family of endoproteases, as a novel therapeutic target in prostate cancer. In the present study we asked the question if PACE4 could also be a potential target in breast cancer. In clinical samples of breast adenocarcinoma, we observed a specific overexpression of PACE4 in the estrogen-receptor (ER) positive subtype. We therefore looked for a breast cancer cell line model which would be representative and thus focused on the ZR-75-1 since it both expresses PACE4 and is estrogen-receptor positive. We compared stable knockdowns of furin, PACE4 and PC7 in the estrogen-receptor-positive cell line ZR-75-1 to evaluate their respective contribution to cell growth and tumor progression. PACE4 was the only PC displaying an impact on cell growth. A PACE4 peptide-based inhibitor (C23) was tested and shown to decrease proliferation of ZR-75-1 cells in cell based assays. C23 also had potent effects of tumor progression in vivo on xenografts of the ZR-75-1 cell line in athymic nude mice. Thus, PACE4-silencing and systemic administration of a PACE4 inhibitor resulted in hindered tumor progression with reduction in proliferative indices and increased cell quiescence assessed with biomarkers. Our results suggest that PACE4 is a promising target for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic molecular Brownian agitation within plasma membrane and the vast diversity of membrane components, it is expected that the plasma membrane organization is highly heterogeneous with the formation of local complex multicomponent assemblies of lipids and proteins on different time scales. Still, deciphering this lateral organization on living cells and on the appropriate length and temporal scales has been challenging but is crucial to advance our knowledge on the biological function of the plasma membrane. Among the methodological developments based on biophotonics, the spot variation FCS (svFCS), a fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS)–based method, has allowed the significant progress in the characterization of cell membrane lateral organization at the suboptical level, including to providing compelling evidence for the in vivo existence of lipid-dependent nanodomains. The aim of this chapter is to serve as a guide for setting and applying the svFCS methodology to study the plasma membrane of both adherent and nonadherent cell types.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division. Dictyostelium cells have multiple modes of cytokinesis, including cytokinesis A, B and C. Cytokinesis A is a conventional mode, which depends on myosin II in the contractile ring. Myosin II null cells divide depending on substratum-attachment (cytokinesis B) or in a multi-polar fashion independent of the cell cycle (cytokinesis C). We investigated the traction stress exerted by dividing cells in the three different modes using traction force microscopy. In all cases, the traction forces were directed inward from both poles. Interestingly, the traction stress of cytokinesis A was the smallest of the three modes. Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, completely diminished the traction stress of dividing cells, but blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase, increased the traction stress. Myosin II is proposed to contribute to the detachment of cell body from the substratum. When the cell-substratum attachment was artificially strengthened by a poly-lysine coating, wild type cells increased their traction stress in contrast to myosin II null and other cytokinesis-deficient mutant cells, which suggests that wild type cells may increase their own power to conduct their cytokinesis. The cytokinesis-deficient mutants frequently divided unequally, whereas wild type cells divided equally. A traction stress imbalance between two daughter halves was correlated with cytokinesis failure. We discuss the regulation of cell shape changes during cell division through mechanosensing.

Abstract: Connexin(Cx)43 regulates the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells and participates in their extravasation. To address the role of endothelial Cx43 in this process, we analyzed Cx43 regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the proximity of Cx43high (DU-145 and MAT-LyLu) and Cx43low prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and AT-2). Endothelial Cx43 up-regulation was observed during the diapedesis of DU-145 and MAT-LyLu cells. This process was attenuated by transient Cx43 silencing in cancer cells and by chemical inhibition of ERK1/2-dependent signaling in endothelial cells. Cx43 expression in endothelial cells was insensitive to the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular coupling between Cx43high prostate cancer and endothelial cells by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid. Instead, endothelial Cx43 up-regulation was correlated with the local contraction of endothelial cells and with their activation in the proximity of Cx43high DU-145 and MAT-LyLu cells. It was also sensitive to pro-inflammatory factors secreted by peripheral blood monocytes, such as TNFα. In contrast to Cx43low AT-2 cells, Cx43low PC-3 cells produced angioactive factors that locally activated the endothelial cells in the absence of endothelial Cx43 up-regulation. Collectively, these data show that Cx43low and Cx43high prostate cancer cells can adapt discrete, Cx43-independent and Cx43-dependent strategies of diapedesis. Our observations identify a novel strategy of prostate cancer cell diapedesis, which depends on the activation of intercellular Cx43/ERK1/2/Cx43 signaling axis at the interfaces between Cx43high prostate cancer and endothelial cells.

Abstract: Thyroid hormone (TH) target cells need to adopt mechanisms to maintain sufficient levels of TH to ensure regular functions. This includes thyroid epithelial cells, which generate TH in addition to being TH-responsive. However, the cellular and molecular pathways underlying thyroid auto-regulation are insufficiently understood. In order to investigate whether thyroglobulin processing and TH export are sensed by thyrocytes, we inactivated thyroglobulin-processing cathepsins and TH-exporting monocarboxylate transporters (Mct) in the mouse. The states of thyroglobulin storage and its protease-mediated processing and degradation were related to the levels of TH transporter molecules by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Thyroid epithelial cells of cathepsin-deficient mice showed increased Mct8 protein levels at the basolateral plasma membrane domains when compared to wild type controls. While the protein amounts of the thyroglobulin-degrading cathepsin D remained largely unaffected by Mct8 or Mct10 single-deficiencies, a significant increase in the amounts of the thyroglobulin-processing cathepsins B and L was detectable in particular in Mct8/Mct10 double deficiency. In addition, it was observed that larger endo-lysosomes containing cathepsins B, D, and L were typical for Mct8- and/or Mct10-deficient mouse thyroid epithelial cells. These data support the notion of a crosstalk between TH transporters and thyroglobulin-processing proteases in thyroid epithelial cells. We conclude that a defect in exporting thyroxine from thyroid follicles feeds back positively on its cathepsin-mediated proteolytic liberation from the precursor thyroglobulin, thereby adding to the development of auto-thyrotoxic states in Mct8 and/or Mct10 deficiencies. The data suggest TH sensing molecules within thyrocytes that contribute to thyroid auto-regulation.

Abstract: The most frequent germline mutations responsible for non syndromic congenital sideroblastic anemia are identified in ALAS2 and SLC25A38 genes. Iron overload is a key issue and optimal chelation therapy should be used to limit its adverse effects on the development of children. Our multicentre retrospective descriptive study compared the strategies for diagnosis and management of congenital sideroblastic anemia during the follow-up of six patients with an ALAS2 mutation and seven patients with an SLC25A38 mutation. We described in depth the clinical, biological and radiological phenotype of these patients at diagnosis and during follow-up and highlighted our results with a review of available evidence and data on the management strategies for congenital sideroblastic anemia. This report confirms the considerable variability in manifestations among patients with ALAS2 or SLC25A38 mutations and draws attention to differences in the assessment and the monitoring of iron overload and its complications. The use of an international registry would certainly help defining recommendations for the management of these rare disorders to improve patient outcome.

Abstract: Summary
Cell therapy is a promising approach to generate an enteric nervous system (ENS) and treat enteric neuropathies. However, for translation to the clinic, it is highly likely that enteric neural progenitors will require manipulation prior to transplantation to enhance their ability to migrate and generate an ENS. In this study, we examine the effects of exposure to several factors on the ability of ENS progenitors, grown as enteric neurospheres, to migrate and generate an ENS. Exposure to glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) resulted in a 14-fold increase in neurosphere volume and a 12-fold increase in cell number. Following co-culture with embryonic gut or transplantation into the colon of postnatal mice in vivo, cells derived from GDNF-treated neurospheres showed a 2-fold increase in the distance migrated compared with controls. Our data show that the ability of enteric neurospheres to generate an ENS can be enhanced by exposure to appropriate factors.

Abstract: Sea urchins have long been used as a model organism to address questions in cell biology and development. Work utilizing this model has elucidated processes of fertilization, the description of centrosomes, the separation of chromosomes during mitosis, and numerous other landmark discoveries. They have been a favorite among researchers for a variety of reasons: Eggs are large and malleable, making them relatively easy to work with; the embryos have synchronized, rapid divisions; they are easy to microinject and manipulate; and their genome sequence is available. In this Chapter, we focus on methods used to study the membrane dynamics during cytokinesis using sea urchin embryos. The focus of this chapter is to provide methods for live-cell imaging of membrane domains in sea urchin embryos.

Incretin hormones regulate microglia oxidative stress, survival and expression of trophic factors,

Abstract: The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are primarily known for their metabolic function in the periphery. GLP-1 and GIP are secreted by intestinal endocrine cells in response to ingested nutrients. Both GLP-1 and GIP stimulate the production and release of insulin from pancreatic β cells as well as exhibit several growth-regulating effects on peripheral tissues. GLP-1 and GIP are also present in the brain, where they provide modulatory and anti-apoptotic signals to neurons. However, very limited information is available regarding the effects of these hormones on glia, the immune and supporting cells of the brain. Therefore, we set out to resolve whether primary human microglia and astrocytes, two subtypes of glial cells, express the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and GIP receptor (GIPR), which are necessary to detect and respond to GLP-1 and GIP, respectively. We further tested whether these hormones, similar to their effects on neuronal cells, have growth-regulating, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects on microglia. We show for the first time expression of the GLP-1R and the GIPR by primary human microglia and astrocytes. We demonstrate that GLP-1 and GIP reduce apoptotic death of murine BV-2 microglia through the binding and activation of the GLP-1R and GIPR, respectively, with subsequent activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Moreover, we reveal that incretins upregulate BV-2 microglia expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- and PKA-dependent manner. We also show that incretins reduce oxidative stress in BV-2 microglia by inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of nitric oxide (NO), as well as by increasing the expression of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). We confirm these results by demonstrating that GLP-1 and GIP also inhibit apoptosis of primary murine microglia, and upregulate expression of BDNF by primary murine microglia. These results indicate that GLP-1 and GIP affect several critical homeostatic functions of microglia, and could therefore be tested as a novel therapeutic treatment option for brain disorders that are characterized by increased oxidative stress and microglial degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolically dormant bacteria present a critical challenge to effective antimicrobial therapy because these bacteria are genetically susceptible to antibiotic treatment but phenotypically tolerant. Such tolerance has been attributed to impaired drug uptake, which can be reversed by metabolic stimulation. Here, we evaluate the effects of central carbon metabolite stimulations on aminoglycoside sensitivity in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We identify fumarate as a tobramycin potentiator that activates cellular respiration and generates a proton motive force by stimulating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In contrast, we find that glyoxylate induces phenotypic tolerance by inhibiting cellular respiration with acetyl-coenzyme A diversion through the glyoxylate shunt, despite drug import. Collectively, this work demonstrates that TCA cycle activity is important for both aminoglycoside uptake and downstream lethality and identifies a potential strategy for potentiating aminoglycoside treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.

Abstract: Glomerular epithelial cells, podocytes, are insulin responsive and can develop insulin resistance. Here, we demonstrate that the small GTPase septin 7 forms a complex with nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC-IIA; encoded by MYH9), a component of the nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM-IIA) hexameric complex. We observed that knockdown of NMHC-IIA decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into podocytes. Both septin 7 and NM-IIA associate with SNAP23, a SNARE protein involved in GLUT4 storage vesicle (GSV) docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. We observed that insulin decreases the level of septin 7 and increases the activity of NM-IIA in the SNAP23 complex, as visualized by increased phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain. Also knockdown of septin 7 increases the activity of NM-IIA in the complex. The activity of NM-IIA is increased in diabetic rat glomeruli and cultured human podocytes exposed to macroalbuminuric sera from patients with type 1 diabetes. Collectively, the data suggest that the activity of NM-IIA in the SNAP23 complex plays a key role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into podocytes. Furthermore, we observed that septin 7 reduces the activity of NM-IIA in the SNAP23 complex and thereby hinders GSV docking and fusion with the plasma membrane.

Abstract: While sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by frequent vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), no direct observation of such an event in skeletal muscle has been performed in vivo. The present study reported exacerbated in vivo metabolic changes suggestive of a spontaneous muscular VOC in exercising muscle of a sickle cell mouse. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy of phosphorus 31, phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate concentrations and intramuscular pH were measured throughout two standardized protocols of rest – exercise – recovery at two different intensities in ten SCD mice. Among these mice, one single mouse presented divergent responses. A statistical analysis (based on confidence intervals) revealed that this single mouse presented slower phosphocreatine resynthesis and inorganic phosphate disappearance during the post-stimulation recovery of one of the protocols, what could suggest an ischemia. This study described, for the first time in a sickle cell mouse in vivo, exacerbated metabolic changes triggered by an exercise session that would be suggestive of a live observation of a muscular VOC. However, no evidence of a direct cause-effect relationship between exercise and VOC has been put forth.

Abstract: Venous thrombosis (VTE) in children is increasingly diagnosed, as advanced medical care has increased treatment intensity of hospitalized pediatric patients. The aim of this review was to summarize the data available and to discuss the controversial issue of thrombophilia screening in the light of the pediatric data available. Follow-up data for VTE recurrence in children suggest a recurrence rate between 3% (neonates) and 21% in individuals with unprovoked VTE. Apart from underlying medical conditions, recently reported systematic reviews on pediatric VTE (70% provoked) have shown significant associations between thrombosis and presence of protein C-, protein S- and antithrombin deficiency, factor 5 (F5: rs6025), factor 2 (F2: rs1799963), even more pronounced when combined inherited thrombophilias [IT] were involved. The F2 mutation, protein C-, protein S-, and antithrombin deficiency did also play a significant role at VTE recurrence. Although we have learned more about the pathophysiology of VTE with the increased discovery of IT evidence is still lacking as to whether IT influence the clinical outcome in pediatric VTE. It still remains controversial as to whether children with VTE or offspring from thrombosis-prone families benefit from IT screening. Thus, IT testing in children should be individualized.

Abstract: Disease characteristics of patients enrolled in the International PNH Registry were assessed during two follow-up periods based on hemolytic status while untreated with eculizumab: Non-hemolytic cohort: follow-up time defined as time from disease start until last reported untreated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value <1.5×upper limit normal (ULN); Hemolytic cohort: follow-up time defined as time from LDH ≥1.5×ULN at or post-disease start, to most recent untreated follow-up. A total of 1012 patients met criteria for the Non-hemolytic cohort and 1565 patients for the Hemolytic cohort; median (min, max) years of follow-up were 2.2 (0.0, 54.2) and 1.2 (0.0, 37.2) years, respectively. Annual rate of thrombotic events (TEs) was lower in the Non-hemolytic than Hemolytic cohort (0.01 events/person-year vs. 0.03 events/person-year; p<0.001). Mortality was lower in the Non-hemolytic cohort than the Hemolytic cohort (0.1% (1 death) vs. 1.8% (22 deaths); p<0.001). While elevated risks for TEs were observed in patients with hemolysis, many TEs were also observed in patients without hemolysis. As thrombosis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with PNH, this real-world analysis highlights the importance of awareness and monitoring for TEs in patients with PNH regardless of hemolytic status.

Abstract: Summary
Introduction
Given the qualitative differences in the role of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms in Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) dosing variation between adults and children, we were interested in determining at what age these polymorphism begin to play a more significant role.
Methods
A prospective cohort study of 190 patients aged 1–86years receiving VKA for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Blood samples were collected beyond the acute thrombotic event when patients were on stable targeted INR (2–3) for plasma testing and VKORC1/CYP2C9 genotyping. Patient demographics including VKA dose were collected. Simple and multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship of VKA dose with polymorphisms and weight, adjusted for quality of anticoagulation (INR, D-Dimer), liver (AST, ALT) and renal function.
Results
In subjects 1–19years of age, weight explained 39.0% of dosing variation with VKORC1 and CYP2C9 playing a minor role. In contrast, in subjects 20–40years weight contributed 23%, VKORC1 44% and CYPC29 49% of the VKA dose variation.
Conclusion
Until the age of 19, weight has a far greater effect on VKA dosing variation than VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms. During the age of 20–40years, VKORC1 and CYP2C9 play a significant role.

Abstract: For maintaining energy homeostasis, creatine kinase (CK) is present at elevated levels in tissues with high and/or fluctuating energy requirements such as muscle, brain, and epithelia, while there is very few CK, if any, in peripheral blood cells. However, an ectopic expression of brain-type creatine kinase (BCK) has been reported for platelets and leukocytes in an autosomal dominant inherited anomaly named CKBE. Here we investigated CK in erythrocytes of CKBE individuals from eight unrelated families. The data revealed a varying but significant increase of CK activity in CKBE individuals as compared to controls, reaching an almost 800-fold increase in two CKBE individuals which also had increased erythrocyte creatine. Immunoblotting with highly specific antibodies confirmed that the expressed CK isoform is BCK. Cell fractionation evidenced soluble BCK, suggesting cytosolic and not membrane localization of erythrocyte CK as reported earlier. These results are discussed in the context of putative CK energy buffering and transfer functions in red blood cells.

Abstract: The contribution of endothelial cells to scar and fibrotic tissue formation is undisputedly connected to their ability to undergo the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) towards fibroblast phenotype-resembling cells. The migration model of fibroblasts and fibroblast-resembling cells is still not fully understood. It may be either a Rho/ROCK-independent, an integrin- and MMP-correlated ECM degradation-dependent, a mesenchymal model or Rho/ROCK-dependent, integrin adhesion- and MMP activity-independent, an amoeboid model. Here, we hypothesized that microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) undergoing EndMT adopt an intermediate state of drifting migration model between the mesenchymal and amoeboid protrusive types in the early stages of fibrosis. We characterized the response of HMEC-1 to TGF-β2, a well-known mediator of EndMT within the microvasculature. We observed that TGF-β2 induces up to an intermediate mesenchymal phenotype in HMEC-1. In parallel, MMP-2 is upregulated and is responsible for most proteolytic activity. Interestingly, the migration of HMEC-1 undergoing EndMT is dependent on both ECM degradation and invadosome formation associated with MMP-2 proteolytic activity and Rho/ROCK cytoskeleton contraction. In conclusion, the transition from mesenchymal towards amoeboid movement highlights a molecular plasticity mechanism in endothelial cell migration in skin fibrosis.

Abstract: Activation of neutrophils is accompanied by the oxidative burst, exocytosis of various granule types (degranulation) and a delay in spontaneous apoptosis. The major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human neutrophils is NADPH oxidase (NOX2), however, other sources of ROS also exist. Although the function of ROS is mainly defensive, they can also play a regulatory role in cell signaling. However, the contribution of various sources of ROS in these processes is not clear. We investigated a possible role of mitochondria-derived ROS (mtROS) in the regulation of neutrophil activation induced by chemoattractant fMLP in vitro. Using the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1, we demonstrated that mtROS are implicated in the oxidative burst caused by NOX2 activation as well as in the exocytosis of primary (azurophil) and secondary (specific) granules. Scavenging of mtROS with SkQ1 slightly accelerated spontaneous apoptosis and significantly stimulated apoptosis of fMLP-activated neutrophils. These data indicate that mtROS play a critical role in signal transduction that mediates the major neutrophil functional responses in the process of activation.

Abstract: Erythroferrone (ERFE) and TMPRSS6 are important proteins in the regulation of iron metabolism. The objective of the study was to examine splenic ERFE and liver TMPRSS6 synthesis in rats treated with a combination of iron and erythropoietin (EPO). EPO was administered to female Wistar rats at 600U/day for four days, iron-pretreated rats received 150mg of iron before EPO treatment. Content of ERFE and TMPRSS6 proteins was determined by commercial antibodies. Iron pretreatment prevented the EPO-induced decrease in hepcidin expression. Content of phosphorylated SMAD 1,5,8 proteins was decreased in the liver by both EPO and iron plus EPO treatment. Fam132b expression in the spleen was increased both by EPO and iron plus EPO treatments; these treatments also significantly induced splenic Fam132a expression. ERFE protein content in the spleen was increased both by EPO and iron plus EPO to a similar extent. EPO administration increased TMPRSS6 content in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction of liver homogenate; in iron-pretreated rats, this increase was abolished. The results confirm that iron pretreatment prevents the EPO-induced decrease in liver Hamp expression. This effect probably occurs despite high circulating ERFE levels, since EPO-induced ERFE protein synthesis is not influenced by iron pretreatment.

Signal dependent transport of a membrane cargo from early endosomes to recycling endosomes,

Abstract: Many membrane cargoes undergo endocytosis and intracellular recycling to the plasma membrane via the early endosomes and the recycling endosomes. However whether specific sorting signals are required for transport from early endosomes to recycling endosomes is not known and the current view is that transport to the recycling endosomes is by a passive default process. Here we show that the cytoplasmic tail of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) contains discrete signals for endocytosis and for sorting to the recycling endosomes. The FcRn cytoplasmic tail has previously been shown to contain the unusual WISL motif for AP2/clathrin-mediated endocytosis. By analysing FcRn mutants and CD8/FcRn chimeric molecules, we have identified an extended WISL sequence (GLPAPWISL) which promotes sorting from the early endosomes to the recycling endosomes. The insertion of GLPAPWISL into the cytoplasmic tail of CD8 resulted in efficient endocytosis and trafficking to the recycling endosomes, with only low levels detected in the late endosomes. Replacement of the highly conserved GLAPAP sequence within the GLPAPWISL motif with alanine residues resulted in endocytosis of the CD8/FcRn chimera to the early endosomes which was then trafficked predominantly to the late endosomes rather than the recycling endosomes. These studies demonstrate that signals within the cytoplasmic domains of membrane cargo can mediate active transport from early to recycling endosomes.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital disorder presenting remarkable phenotypic overlap with other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, making differential diagnosis challenging and its confirmation often reached with great delay. By whole exome sequencing, we unraveled the presence of pathogenic variants affecting genes already known to be involved in DBA pathogenesis (RPL5 and RPS19) in three patients with otherwise uncertain clinical diagnosis, and provided new insights on DBA genotype-phenotype correlations. Remarkably, the RPL5 c.482del frameshift mutation has never been reported before, whereas the RPS19 c.3G>T missense mutation, although previously described in a 2-month-old DBA patient without malformations and refractory to steroid therapy, was detected here in the mosaic state in different bodily tissues for the first time in DBA patients.

Abstract: Sarcoma is a type of cancer affecting connective, supportive, or soft tissue of mesenchymal origin. Despite rare incidence in adults (<1%), over 15% of pediatric cancers are sarcoma. Sadly, both adults and children with relapsed or metastatic disease have devastatingly high rates of mortality. Current treatment options for sarcoma include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy; however, significant limitations exist with respect to the efficacy of these strategies. Strong impetus has been placed on the development of novel therapies and preclinical models for uncovering mechanisms involved in the development, progression, and therapy resistance of sarcoma. Over the past 15 years, the zebrafish has emerged as a powerful genetic model of human cancer. High genetic conservation when combined with a unique susceptibility to develop sarcoma has made the zebrafish an effective tool for studying these diseases. Transgenic and gene-activation strategies have been employed to develop zebrafish models of rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, Ewing's sarcoma, chordoma, hemangiosarcoma, and liposarcoma. These models all display remarkable molecular and histopathological conservation with their human cancer counterparts and have offered excellent platforms for understanding disease progression in vivo. Short tumor latency and the amenability of zebrafish for ex vivo manipulation, live imaging studies, and tumor cell transplantation have allowed for efficient study of sarcoma initiation, growth, self-renewal, and maintenance. When coupled with facile chemical genetic approaches, zebrafish models of sarcoma have provided a strong translational tool to uncover novel drug pathways and new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Resistin-like molecule-β (RELM-β), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and survivin may be involved in the proliferation of cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPAMSCs), which is involved in pulmonary hypertension. HPAMSCs were treated with human recombinant RELM-β (rhRELM-β). siRNAs against FAK and survivin were transfected into cultured HPASMCs. Expression of FAK and survivin were examined by RT-PCR and western blot. Immunofluorescence was used to localize FAK. Flow cytometry was used to examine cell cycle distribution and cell death. Compared to the control group, all rhRELM-β-treated groups demonstrated significant increases in the expression of FAK and survivin (P<0.05). rhRELM-β significantly increased the proportion of HPASMCs in the S phase and decreased the proportion in G0/G1. FAK siRNA down-regulated survivin expression while survivin siRNA did not affect FAK expression. FAK siRNA effectively inhibited FAK and survivin expression in RELM-β-treated HPASMCs and partially suppressed cell proliferation. RELM-β promoted HPASMC proliferation and upregulated FAK and survivin expression. In conclusion, results suggested that FAK is upstream of survivin in the signaling pathway mediating cell proliferation. FAK seems to be important in RELM-β-induced HPASMC proliferation, partially by upregulating survivin expression.

Abstract: While fluorescence microscopy provides tools for highly specific labeling and sensitive detection, its resolution limit and lack of general contrast has hindered studies of cellular structure and protein localization. Recent advances in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), including the fully integrated CLEM workflow instrument, the FEI CorrSight with MAPS, have allowed for a more reliable, reproducible, and quicker approach to correlate three-dimensional time-lapse confocal fluorescence data, with three-dimensional focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy data. Here we demonstrate the entire integrated CLEM workflow using fluorescently tagged MCF7 breast cancer cells.

Abstract: In most species, cytokinesis is blocked in germ cells during at least some stage of their development. Abscission is difficult to assess directly in germ cells which are located in internal organs. Here, we described several indirect and direct methods to monitor the completion of abscission in Drosophila germ line cells. These methods are based on the observation that cells still connected by some cytoplasm share some degree of synchronization of their cell cycle. This synchrony can be detected on fixed tissue (Section 1.1), including using EdU incorporation to label S-phase (Section 1.2). Mitotic synchrony can also be observed using short-term live imaging (Section 1.3). Finally, we describe how the completion of abscission can be monitored using photoactivatable markers diffusing or not between two cells (Section 1.4).

Abstract: We describe a novel mechanism of mRNA decay regulation, which takes place under the conditions of glucose deprivation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The regulation is based on temporally stable sequestration of the main 5′-3′ mRNA exoribonuclease Xrn1 at the eisosome, a plasma membrane-associated protein complex organizing a specialized membrane microdomain. As documented by monitoring the decay of a specific mRNA substrate in time, Xrn1-mediated mRNA degradation ceases during the accumulation of Xrn1 at eisosome, but the eisosome-associated Xrn1 retains its functionality and can be re-activated when released to cytoplasm following the addition of glucose. In cells lacking the eisosome organizer Pil1, Xrn1 does not associate with the plasma membrane and its activity is preserved till the stationary phase. Thus, properly assembled eisosome is necessary for this kind of Xrn1 regulation, which occurs in a liquid culture as well as in a differentiated colony.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle function has been scarcely investigated in sickle cell disease (SCD) so that the corresponding impact of sickle hemoglobin is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle force production and fatigability in SCD and to identify whether exercise intensity could have a modulatory effect. Ten homozygous sickle cell (HbSS), ten control (HbAA) and ten heterozygous (HbAS) mice were submitted to two stimulation protocols (moderate and intense) to assess force production and fatigability. We showed that specific maximal tetanic force was lower in HbSS mice as compared to other groups. At the onset of the stimulation period, peak force was reduced in HbSS and HbAS mice as compared to HbAA mice. Contrary to the moderate protocol, the intense stimulation protocol was associated with a larger decrease in peak force and rate of force development in HbSS mice as compared to HbAA and HbAS mice. These findings provide in vivo evidence of impaired muscle force production and resistance to fatigue in SCD. These changes are independent of muscle mass. Moreover, SCD is associated with muscle fatigability when exercise intensity is high.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF) has favorable biological effects, and its neuroprotection in a variety of neurological diseases has been noted. Our previous study showed that treatment of 5-HMF led to protection against permanent global cerebral ischemia. However, the underlying mechanisms in cerebral ischemic injury are not fully understood. This study was conducted to investigate the neuroprotective effect of 5-HMF and elucidate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway mechanism in the striatum after transient global cerebral ischemia. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 20 min and sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion. 5-HMF (12 mg/kg) or an equal volume of vehicle was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before ischemia and 5 min after the onset of reperfusion. At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological function was evaluated by neurological disability status scale, locomotor activity test and inclined beam walking test. Histological injury of the striatum was observed by cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dNTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Oxidative stress was evaluated by the carbonyl groups introduced into proteins, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based measurement was used to detect Nrf2 DNA binding activity. Nrf2 and its downstream ARE pathway protein expression such as heme oxygenase-1, NAD (P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit and glutamate-cysteine ligase modulatory subunit were detected by western blot. Our results showed that 5-HMF treatment significantly ameliorated neurological deficits, reduced brain water content, attenuated striatum neuronal damage, decreased the carbonyl groups and MDA levels, and activated Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 5-HMF exerted significant antioxidant and neuroprotective effects following transient cerebral ischemia, possibly through the activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
Inherited platelet deficiency and/or dysfunction may be more common in the general population than has previously been appreciated. In 2013 the Israeli Inherited Platelet Disorder (IPD) Registry was established.
Methods
Clinical and laboratory data were collected to pre-specified registration forms. The study protocol was approved by the local hospital ethics committees.
Results
To date we have included in the registry 89 patients (male 52%) from 79 families. Most patients (74%) have a not-yet specified inherited thrombocytopenia (n=39) or non-specific platelet function disorder (n=27). Full clinical data were available for 81 (91%) patients. The median (range) age at presentation and time of follow-up were 1.8years (1day–17.8years) and 4.7 (0–26) years, respectively. The Pediatric Bleeding Questionnaire was available for 78patients; abnormal bleeding score (≥2) was recorded in 47 (52.8%, 95% CI 42%–63.5%) patients and was less frequent in patients followed for isolated thrombocytopenia. Abnormal score was associated with a longer time of follow-up, OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.04–1.36).
Conclusion
Long term follow-up of patients with IPDs is important as bleeding risks may increase with time. We expect that clinical and laboratory information of patients/families with IPDs gathered in a systemic format will allow for better diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

Abstract: The regulation of fat metabolism is important for maintaining functional and structural tissue homeostasis in biological systems. Reducing excessive lipids has been an important concern due to the concomitant health risks caused by metabolic disorders such as obesity, adiposity and dyslipidemia. A recent study revealed that unlike conventional care regimens (e.g., diet or medicine), low-energy visible radiation (VR) regulates lipid levels via autophagy-dependent hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation in differentiated human adipose-derived stem cells. To clarify the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, we first verified the photoreceptor and photoreceptor-dependent signal cascade in nonvisual 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For a better understanding of the concomitant phenomena that result from VR exposure, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to four different wavelengths of VR (410, 505, 590 and 660nm) in this study. The results confirmed that specific VR wavelengths, especially 505nm than 590nm, increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and decrease lipid droplets. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein levels of the Opn2 (rhodopsin) photoreceptor increased after VR exposure in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Subsequent treatment of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes at a specific VR wavelength induced rhodopsin- and β3-adrenergic receptor (AR)-dependent lipolytic responses that consequently led to increases in intracellular cAMP and phosphorylated HSL protein levels. Our study indicates that photoreceptors are expressed and exert individual functions in nonvisual cells, such as adipocytes. We suggest that the VR-induced photoreceptor system could be a potential therapeutic target for the regulation of lipid homeostasis in a non-invasive manner.

Abstract: Summary
The lymphoid-myeloid transdifferentiation potentials of members of the C/EBP family (C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε) were compared in v-Abl-immortalized primary B cells. Conversion of B cells to macrophages was readily induced by the ectopic expression of any C/EBP, and enhanced by endogenous C/EBPα and β activation. High transgene expression of C/EBPβ or C/EBPε, but not of C/EBPα or C/EBPδ, also induced the formation of granulocytes. Granulocytes and macrophages emerged in a mutually exclusive manner. C/EBPβ-expressing B cells produced granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP)-like progenitors when subjected to selective pressure to eliminate lymphoid cells. The GMP-like progenitors remained self-renewing and cytokine-independent, and continuously produced macrophages and granulocytes. In addition to their suitability to study myelomonocytic lineage bifurcation, lineage-switched GMP-like progenitors could reflect the features of the lympho-myeloid lineage switch observed in leukemic progression.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to mediate angiogenic effects in endothelial cells. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that LPS induced high motility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) secretion in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Knockdown and overexpression of HMGB1 by adenoviral vectors effectively inhibited and promoted LPS-induced HPMEC migration and capillary-like tube formation, respectively. On the other hand, HMGB1 exerted an inhibitory effect on LPS-suppressed expression of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31) and p120 catenin (p120); HMGB1 knockdown reversed this effect. These results suggest a functional synergy between LPS and HMGB1 in angiogenesis. Mechanistically, physical interaction of LPS with HMGB1 mediated dissociation of p120, β-catenin, and γ-catenin from vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), but without affecting VE-cadherin expression. The synergistic effect of LPS and HMGB1 was closely associated with ERK/P38/Src signaling pathway, as evidenced by the reduced degree of migration and capillary-like tube formation in HPMECs treated with signaling pathway inhibitor. Collectively, our study shows a novel mechanism whereby LPS and HMGB1 synergistically regulate the angiogenic behavior of endothelial cells.

Abstract: γ2 adaptin is homologous to γ1, but is only expressed in vertebrates while γ1 is found in all eukaryotes. We know little about γ2 functions and their relation to γ1. γ1 is an adaptin of the heterotetrameric AP-1 complexes, which sort proteins in and do form clathrin-coated transport vesicles and they also regulate maturation of early endosomes. γ1 knockout mice develop only to blastocysts and thus γ2 does not compensate γ1-deficiency in development. γ2 has not been classified as a clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor protein in proteome analyses and functions for monomeric γ2 in endosomal protein sorting have been proposed, but adaptin interaction studies suggested formation of heterotetrameric AP-1/γ2 complexes. We detected γ2 at the trans-Golgi network, on peripheral vesicles and identified γ2 clathrin-coated vesicles in mice. Ubiquitous σ1A and tissue-specific σ1B adaptins bind γ2 and γ1. σ1B knockout in mice does not effect γ1/σ1A AP-1 levels, but γ2/σ1A AP-1 levels are increased in brain and adipocytes. Also γ2 is essential in development. In zebrafish AP-1/γ2 and AP-1/γ1 fulfill different, essential functions in brain and the vascular system.

Abstract: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) are envisioned as a powerful therapeutic tool. As they home into tumors, secrete trophic and vasculogenic factors, and suppress immune response their role in carcinogenesis is a matter of controversy. Worldwide oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the fifth most common epithelial cancer. Our aim was to determine whether MSC administration at precancerous stage modifies the natural progression of OSCC. OSCC was induced in Syrian hamsters by topical application of DMBA in the buccal pouch. At papilloma stage, the vehicle or 3×106 allogenic bone marrow-derived MSCs were locally administered. Four weeks later, the lesions were studied according to: volume, stratification (histology), proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (Caspase 3 cleaved), vasculature (ASMA), inflammation (Leukocyte infiltrate), differentiation (CK1 and CK4) and gene expression profile (mRNA). Tumors found in individuals that received MSCs were smaller than those presented in the vehicle group (87±80 versus 54±62mm3, p<0.05). The rate of proliferation was two times lower and the apoptosis was 2.5 times higher in lesions treated with MSCs than in untreated ones. While the laters presented dedifferentiated cells, the former maintained differentiated cells (cytokeratin and gene expression profile similar to normal tissue). Thus, MSC administration at papilloma stage precludes tumor growth and epithelial dedifferentiation of OSCC.

Abstract: Morphogenesis of multicellular organisms is driven by changes in cell behavior, which happen at precise locations and defined developmental stages. Therefore, the studying of morphogenetic events would greatly benefit from tools that allow the perturbation of cell activity with spatial and temporal precision. We recently developed an optogenetic approach to modulate cell contractility with cellular precision and on fast (seconds) timescales during Drosophila embryogenesis. We present here a protocol to handle genetically engineered photosensitive Drosophila embryos and achieve light-mediated inhibition of apical constriction during tissue invagination. The possibility to modulate the levels of optogenetic activation at different laser powers makes this method suited also for studying how mechanical stresses are sensed and interpreted in vivo. Given the conserved function of cell contractility during animal development, the application of this method to other morphogenetic processes will facilitate our understanding of tissue mechanics and cell–cell interaction during morphogenesis.

Abstract: Cell competition was described in Drosophila as the loss from mosaic tissues of otherwise viable cells heterozygous for Ribosomal protein mutations (‘Minutes’). Cell competition has now been described to occur between multiple other genotypes, such as cells differing in myc expression levels, or mutated for neoplastic tumor suppressors. Recent studies implicate innate immunity components, and possibly mechanical stress, compression and cell intercalation as a consequence of differential growth rates in competitive cell death. Competition to eliminate pre-neoplastic tumors makes use of signals and receptors also used in patterning the nervous system including Slit/Robo2 and Sas/PTP10D to recognize and extrude clones of mutant cells, at least where local epithelial cyto-architecture is favorable. Cell competition facilitates expansion of Drosophila tumors through host tissue, and in normal development may promote developmental robustness and longevity by selecting for optimal progenitor cells.

Abstract: Adipose tissues (ATs) are lipid-rich structures that supply and sequester energy-dense lipid in response to the energy status of an organism. As such, ATs provide an organism energetic insurance during periods of adverse physiological burden. ATs are deposited in diverse anatomical locations, and excessive accumulation of particular regional ATs modulates disease risk. Therefore, a model system that facilitates the visualization and quantification of regional adiposity holds significant biomedical promise. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a new model system for AT research in which the entire complement of regional ATs can be imaged and quantified in live individuals. Here we present detailed methods for labeling adipocytes in live zebrafish using fluorescent lipophilic dyes, and for identifying and quantifying regional zebrafish ATs.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has evolved from an effective research tool to a non-invasive clinical modality with versatile applications. The accuracy of volume measurements and functional assessment and the ability to identify unique myocardial tissue characteristics non-invasively are the primary advantages of CMR. The use of CMR in sickle cell disease (SCD) has been limited clinically to myocardial iron assessment. The use of other CMR applications to characterize the cardiac pathology in SCD is slowly emerging but remains limited to research level. In this review, we discuss some of the applications of CMR in studying cardiovascular diseases and its potential uses in SCD for research and clinical purposes.

Abstract: Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) plays a critical role in cell motility, maintenance of apical-basal polarity, and epithelial morphogenesis. We previously demonstrated that APC loss in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells increases cyst size and inverts polarity independent of Wnt signaling, and upregulates the tetraspan protein, Epithelial Membrane Protein 2 (EMP2). Herein, we show that APC loss increases β1 integrin expression and migration of MDCK cells. Through 3D in vitro model systems and 2D migration analysis, we have depicted the molecular mechanism(s) by which APC influences polarity and cell motility. EMP2 knockdown in APC shRNA cells revealed that APC regulates apical-basal polarity and cyst size through EMP2. Chemical inhibition of β1 integrin and its signaling components, FAK and Src, indicated that APC controls cyst size and migration, but not polarity, through β1 integrin and its downstream targets. Combined, the current studies have identified two distinct and novel mechanisms required for APC to regulate polarity, cyst size, and cell migration independent of Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is essential for development and survival of all organisms by increasing cell number and diversity. It is a highly regulated process that requires spatiotemporal coordination of hundreds of proteins functioning in the assembly, constriction, and disassembly of a contractile actomyosin ring, targeted vesicle fusion, and localized extracellular matrix remodeling. Cytokinesis has been studied in multiple systems with a wide range of technologies to learn the common principles. In this chapter, we describe the analysis of protein dynamics during cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by several live-cell imaging methods. This, in combination with the power of yeast genetics, has yielded novel insights into the mechanism of cytokinesis. Similar approaches are increasingly used to study this fundamental process in more complex systems.

Abstract: We report optimized methods for preparing actin-intact Xenopus egg extract. This extract is minimally perturbed, undiluted egg cytoplasm where the cell cycle can be experimentally controlled. It contains abundant organelles and glycogen and supports active metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics that closely mimic egg physiology. The concentration of the most abundant ∼11,000 proteins is known from mass spectrometry. Actin-intact egg extract can be used for analysis of actin dynamics and interaction of actin with other cytoplasmic systems, as well as microtubule organization. It can be spread as thin layers and naturally depletes oxygen though mitochondrial metabolism, which makes it ideal for fluorescence imaging. When combined with artificial lipid bilayers, it allows reconstitution and analysis of the spatially controlled signaling that positions the cleavage furrow during early cytokinesis. Actin-intact extract is generally useful for probing the biochemistry and biophysics of the large Xenopus egg. Protocols are provided for preparation of actin-intact egg extract, control of the cell cycle, fluorescent probes for cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-dependent signaling, preparation of glass surfaces for imaging experiments, and immunodepletion to probe the role of specific proteins and protein complexes. We also describe methods for adding supported lipid bilayers to mimic the plasma membrane and for confining in microfluidic droplets to explore size scaling issues.

Abstract: All animals are ecosystems with resident microbial communities, referred to as microbiota, which play profound roles in host development, physiology, and evolution. Enabled by new DNA sequencing technologies, there is a burgeoning interest in animal–microbiota interactions, but dissecting the specific impacts of microbes on their hosts is experimentally challenging. Gnotobiology, the study of biological systems in which all members are known, enables precise experimental analysis of the necessity and sufficiency of microbes in animal biology by deriving animals germ-free (GF) and inoculating them with defined microbial lineages. Mammalian host models have long dominated gnotobiology, but we have recently adapted gnotobiotic approaches to the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important aquatic model. Zebrafish offer several experimental attributes that enable rapid, large-scale gnotobiotic experimentation with high replication rates and exquisite optical resolution. Here we describe detailed protocols for three procedures that form the foundation of zebrafish gnotobiology: derivation of GF embryos, microbial association of GF animals, and long-term, GF husbandry. Our aim is to provide sufficient guidance in zebrafish gnotobiotic methodology to expand and enrich this exciting field of research.

Abstract: Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular degradation pathway which is crucial for various cellular processes. The autophagic process is subdivided in the initiation, autophagosome maturation and lysosomal degradation phases and involves more than forty core and accessory autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. Autophagy 8 (ATG8, in mammals LC3) is a well-established marker of autophagy and is linked to the autophagic membrane from initiation until fusion with the lysosome. We generated single and double knock-out mutants of the two Dictyostelium paralogues, ATG8a and ATG8b, as well as strains that expressed RFP-ATG8a and/or GFP-ATG8b, RFP-ATG8b, RFP-GFP-ATG8a or RFP-GFP-ATG8b in different knock-out mutants. The ATG8b¯ mutant displayed only subtle phenotypic changes in comparison to AX2 wild-type cells. In contrast, deletion of ATG8a resulted in a complex phenotype with delayed development, reduced growth, phagocytosis and cell viability, an increase in ubiquitinylated proteins and a concomitant decrease in proteasomal activity. The phenotype of the ATG8a¯/b¯ strain was, except for cell viability, in all aforementioned aspects more severe, showing that both proteins function in parallel during most analysed cellular processes. Immunofluorescence analysis of knock-out strains expressing either RFP-GFP-ATG8a or RFP-GFP-ATG8b suggests a crucial function for ATG8b in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Quantitative analysis of strains expressing RFP-ATG8a, RFP-ATG8b, or RFP-ATG8a and GFP-ATG8b revealed that ATG8b generally localised to small and large vesicles, whereas ATG8a preferentially co-localised with ATG8b on large vesicles, indicating that ATG8b associated with nascent autophagosomes before ATG8a, which is supported by previous results (Matthias et al., 2016). Deconvoluted confocal fluorescence images showed that ATG8b localised around ATG8a and was presumably mainly present on the outer membrane of the autophagosome while ATG8a appears to be mainly associated with the inner membrane. In summary, our data show that ATG8a and ATG8b have distinct functions and are involved in canonical as well as non-canonical autophagy. The data further suggest that ATG8b predominantly acts as adapter for the autophagy machinery at the outer and ATG8a as cargo receptor at the inner membrane of the autophagosome.

Abstract: The primary defense machinery to combat inflammation involves neutrophil granulocytes which in order to execute their functions rely on the efficiency of different cellular mechanisms including adhesion, spreading, migration in different environments, and phagocytosis. These functions require an accurately regulated actin network as well as the activation and adjustment of various signaling pathways. Mammalian filamins (FLNs) comprise three highly homologous large actin-binding proteins that are obvious candidates to control these processes as FLNs have been described to play a role in migration, spreading and adhesion in a variety of different cell types. The present study analyzed the role of filamin A (FLNa) in human neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. We found a strong enrichment of FLNa at the uropod of migrating neutrophils, and show that deficiency of FLNa caused a decrease in speed of migration both in 2D and 3D that is accompanied by a reduced activation of myosin-II. In addition, we show that FLNa plays a role in neutrophil phagocytosis. We also identified a hitherto unknown interaction of FLNa with coronin 1A that is mediated by FLNa repeats 9–18. FLNa deficiency had no or only minor effects on cell adhesion and spreading. In summary, deficiency of FLNa in human neutrophil-like HL-60 cells resulted in a surprisingly subtle phenotype. Our data indicate that FLNa is not essential for the regulation of mechanical properties during migration, but contributes to motility in a modulatory manner probably through its action at the uropod.

Abstract: Anticoagulation of neonates, children and adolescents remains an important part of clinical care for many individuals. There are different options for anticoagulation, each with their own advantages and disadvantages and selection of an appropriate anticoagulation regime for the specific condition should be judicious. This is in part because age related differences in the coagulation systems exist that mean that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anticoagulation drugs vary across the pediatric spectrum in addition to being distinct from adults. The use of anticoagulant drugs presents specific challenges in the pediatric setting. This review will consider the main anticoagulants currently in use in neonates, children and adolescents, specifically Heparin (unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin) vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) as well as a brief discussion of fondaparinux.

Abstract: Hydroxyurea (HU) is a key drug therapy for individuals with sickle cell anemia (SCA), yet its clinical and hematologic responses can be variable. Various studies have reported the role of α-thalassemia as one of the most prevalent heritable traits that may modify HU response. We provide data from 62 pediatric and adolescent patients with SCA, 26 with co-inherited α-thalassemia trait. Our data suggest that altered hematologic and clinical responses to HU therapy are noted in adolescent SCA individuals with co-inherited α-thalassemia trait. Adolescent patients who co-inherited α-thalassemia trait had a greater reduction in vaso-occlusive episodes compared to those without α-thalassemia, despite a less robust fetal hemoglobin induction as well as a lower maximum HU dose. This clinical improvement was associated with a lower MCH and higher RBC count. Responses to HU in younger SCA children (ages 5–11years) with co-inherited α-thalassemia trait, compared to those without α-thalassemia trait, did not show any difference in number vaso-occlusive episodes, fetal hemoglobin induction and change in MCH and RBC count.

Abstract: In a male patient suffering from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) we found a c.389G>T mutation in exon 5 of the CYBB gene. We have analyzed why 95% of the transcripts of this gene lacked exon 5, leading to a frameshift and premature termination codon. The mutation was located in a region comprising three putative exonic splicing enhancer binding sites, for SRSF1, SRFS2 and SRFS6, according to the ESEfinder Tool (http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/tools/ESE3/esefinder.cgi). With the Analyser Splice Tool we calculated the probability of skipping of exon 5 in CYBB mRNA, and by means of Sroogle the number of putative binding motifs for splicing enhancer and splicing silencer proteins (http://astlab.tau.ac.il/index.php). These analyses clarify why this exon was skipped in the majority of the mRNA. The normally spliced transcript contains an amino acid change p.Arg130Leu. This poorly expressed transcript gives rise to a protein with low expression but presumably normal activity, leading to a respiratory burst activity in the patient's neutrophils of about 15% of normal.

Abstract: Polyploidy, the state of having greater than a diploid DNA content (tetraploid, octoploid, etc.) is a characteristic feature of mammalian hepatocytes and accompanies late fetal development and postnatal maturation of the liver. During the weaning period, diploid hepatocytes can engage either into normal cell division cycle giving rise to two diploid hepatocytes or follow a scheduled division program characterized by incomplete cytokinesis. In that case, diploid hepatocytes undergo mitosis, but do not form a contractile ring. Indeed, cleavage-plane specification is never established, because of the deficiencies of actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Furthermore, microtubules fail both to contact the cortex and to deliver their molecular signal, preventing localization and activation of RhoA. Therefore, cytokinesis aborts and a binucleate tetraploid liver cell is generated, which subsequently plays a pivotal role in liver progressive polyploidization. In this chapter, we describe detailed protocols to monitor hepatocyte proliferation and cytokinesis process by in situ and dynamic ex vivo approaches.

Abstract: The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and related proteins has revolutionized light microscopy. Here we describe a rapid and simple method to localize GFP-tagged proteins in cells and in tissues by electron microscopy (EM) using a modular approach involving a small GFP-binding peptide (GBP) fused to the ascorbate peroxidase–derived APEX2 tag. We provide a method for visualizing GFP-tagged proteins by light and EM in cultured cells and in the zebrafish using modular APEX-GBP. Furthermore, we describe in detail the benefits of this technique over many of the currently available correlative light and electron microscopy approaches and demonstrate APEX-GBP is readily applicable to modern three-dimensional techniques.

Abstract: Traditionally, transplantation has been a major experimental procedure to study the development and function of hematopoietic and immune systems. Here, we describe the use of a zebrafish strain lacking definitive hematopoiesis (cmybI181N) for interspecific analysis of hematopoietic and immune cell development. Without conditioning prior to transplantation, allogeneic and xenogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells stably engraft in adult zebrafish homozygous for the cmyb mutation. This unique animal model can be used to genetically and functionally disentangle universal and species-specific contributions of the microenvironment to hematopoietic progenitor cell maintenance and development.

Abstract: Translationally controlled tumor protein (Tpt1/TCTP) is a multi-functional cytosolic protein whose cellular levels are finely tuned. TCTP regulates protein behavior by favoring stabilization of protein partners or on the contrary by promoting degradation of others. TCTP has been shown to be transcriptionally and translationally regulated, but much less is known about its degradation process. In this study, we present evidence that chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) contributes to TCTP regulation. CMA allows lysosomal degradation of specific cytosolic proteins on a molecule-by-molecule basis. It contributes to cellular homeostasis especially by acting as a quality control for cytosolic proteins in response to stress and as a way of regulating the level of specific proteins. Using a variety of approaches, we show that CMA degradation of TCTP is Hsc70 and LAMP-2A dependent. Our data indicate that (i) TCTP directly interacts with Hsc70; (ii) silencing LAMP-2A in MEFs using siRNA leads to inhibition of TCTP downregulation; (iii) TCTP is relocalized from a diffuse cytosolic pattern to a punctate lysosomal pattern when CMA is upregulated; (iv) TCTP is degraded in vitro by purified lysosomes. Importantly, using lysine-mutated forms of TCTP, we show that acetylation of Lysine 19 generates a KFERQ-like motif and promotes binding to Hsc70, lysosome targeting and TCTP degradation by CMA. Altogether these results indicate that TCTP is degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy in an acetylation dependent manner.

Abstract: Hydroxyurea is a potent disease-modifying therapeutic agent with efficacy for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. When administered at once-daily oral doses that lead to mild marrow suppression, hydroxyurea leads to substantial and sustained fetal hemoglobin induction, which effectively inhibits erythrocyte sickling. When escalated to maximum tolerated dose, hydroxyurea has proven laboratory and clinical effects for both children and adults with sickle cell anemia. However, there is substantial inter-patient variability with regard to the optimal dosing regimen, as well as differences in treatment-related toxicities and responses that may be explained by hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics. Addressing the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea treatment requires quantitative and accurate drug analysis, and various laboratory techniques have been established. We review the historical and current analytical techniques for measuring hydroxyurea concentrations accurately, and discuss clinical settings where quantitative analysis can increase understanding and safety of this important therapeutic agent, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Proprotein Convertase 7 (PC7) is a Furin-like endoprotease that cleaves precursor proteins at basic amino acids. PC7 is concentrated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) but it shuttles between the plasma membrane and the TGN depending on sequences in the cytoplasmic tail. A short region containing a three amino acids motif, P724-L725-C726, is essential and sufficient for internalization of PC7 but not for TGN localization, which requires the additional presence of the juxtamembrane region. In this study we have investigated the contribution of a cluster of basic amino acids and two reversibly palmitoylated cysteine residues to endocytic trafficking. Stable cell lines overexpressing chimeric proteins (CD25 and CD46) containing the cytoplasmic domain of PC7 in which the basic cluster alone or together with both palmitoylated cysteines are mutated showed enhanced surface expression as demonstrated by immunofluorescence experiments and surface biotinylation. The mutant proteins no longer recycled to the TGN in antibody uptake experiments and accumulated in an endosomal compartment. Recycling of wild type PC7 to the TGN is blocked by nocodazole, suggesting that PC7 shuttles to the TGN via late endosomes, similar to Furin. Unlike furin, however, PC7 was found to recycle to a region within the TGN, which is deficient in sialyltransferase, as shown by resialylation experiments. In conclusion, a novel motif, composed of a basic amino acid cluster and two palmitoylated cysteines are essential for TGN localization and endocytic trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
Ensuring that gut microbiota respond consistently to prescribed dietary interventions, irrespective of prior dietary practices (DPs), is critical for effective nutritional therapy. To address this, we identified DP-associated gut bacterial taxa in individuals either practicing chronic calorie restriction with adequate nutrition (CRON) or without dietary restrictions (AMER). When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, AMER and CRON microbiota responded predictably to CRON and AMER diets but with variable response strengths. An individual’s microbiota is connected to other individuals’ communities (“metacommunity”) by microbial exchange. Sequentially cohousing AMER-colonized mice with two different groups of CRON-colonized mice simulated metacommunity effects, resulting in enhanced responses to a CRON diet intervention and changes in several metabolic features in AMER animals. This response was driven by an influx of CRON DP-associated taxa. Certain DPs may impair responses to dietary interventions, necessitating the introduction of diet-responsive bacterial lineages present in other individuals and identified using the strategies described.

Abstract: S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) is thought to be located at the sites of ongoing AdoMet-dependent methylation, presumably in the cell nucleus. Endogenous AHCY is located both in cytoplasm and the nucleus. Little is known regarding mechanisms that drive its subcellular distribution, and even less is known on how mutations causing AHCY deficiency affect its intracellular dynamics. Using fluorescence microscopy and GFP-tagged AHCY constructs we show significant differences in the intensity ratio between nuclei and cytoplasm for mutant proteins when compared with wild type AHCY. Interestingly, nuclear export of AHCY is not affected by leptomycin B. Systematic deletions showed that AHCY has two regions, located at both sides of the protein, that contribute to its nuclear localization, implying the interaction with various proteins. In order to evaluate protein interactions in vivo we engaged in bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) based studies. We investigated previously assumed interaction with AHCY-like-1 protein (AHCYL1), a paralog of AHCY. Indeed, significant interaction between both proteins exists. Additionally, silencing AHCYL1 leads to moderate inhibition of nuclear export of endogenous AHCY.

Abstract: Background
The complexity of Rh genetic variation among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients is high. Conventional molecular assays cannot identify all genetic variants already described for the RH locus as well as foresee novel alleles. Sequencing RHD and RHCE is indicated to broaden the search for Rh genetic variants.
Aims
To standardize the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategy to assertively identify Rh genetic variants among SCD patients with serologic suspicion of Rh variants and evaluate if it can improve the transfusion support.
Methods
Thirty-five SCD patients with unexplained Rh antibodies were enrolled. A NGS-based strategy was developed to genotype RHD and RHCE using gene-specific primers. Genotype and serological data were compared.
Results
Data obtained from the NGS-based assay were gene-specific. Ten and 25 variant RHD and RHCE alleles were identified, respectively. Among all cases of unexplained Rh antibodies, 62% had been inaccurately classified by serological analysis and, of these, 73.1% were considered as relevant, as were associated with increased risk of hemolytic reactions and shortage of units suitable for transfusion.
Conclusion
The NGS assay designed to genotype RH coding regions was effective and accurate in identifying variants. The proposed strategy clarified the Rh phenotype of most patients, improving transfusion support.

Abstract: Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is a scientific method covered by a broad range of techniques. The path taken to explore a scientific question is often driven both by the question and the technology available. Yet, one common step to all CLEM workflows is the registration of the multimodal images to assign a fluorescent signal to an ultrastructure. The manual relocation and registration of light microscopy and electron microscopy images can be challenging and time-consuming (Muller-Reichert & Verkade, 2014). eC-CLEM is a free open-source software to address this step. eC-CLEM has been designed with an intuitive procedure and the manual registration has been extensively described in step-by-step protocols on the eC-CLEM webpage as well as video tutorials. In this book chapter, we focus our description on the “automatic registration” procedure, which requires some fine tuning. We recommend the user to first get familiar with eC-CLEM through the aforementioned tutorials. If large volume data sets or automatic tracking and controlling of microscopes are pursued by the user, going through the fine-tuning steps described in this chapter is worth the effort.

Abstract: Sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol) are the major lipids in the mammalian cells, which are mainly localized to the plasma membrane. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these lipids form local lipid domains in the plasma membrane, playing functional roles in the cell. Several observations have suggested that these lipid domains are required for cytokinesis. In this chapter, we show the methods for visualizing SM-rich and/or Chol-rich membrane domains at cytokinesis by using specific lipid-binding proteins. Lysenin, equinatoxin II, perfringolysin O, and pleurotolysin A2 bind specifically to clustered SM-rich domain, dispersed SM-rich domain, Chol-rich domain, and SM/Chol mixtures, respectively. Nontoxic forms of these lipid-binding proteins fused to fluorescent proteins are used for imaging lipid domains in biological membranes at cytokinesis. The image analysis reveals the structures and functions of SM-rich and/or Chol-rich domains at the time of cytokinesis.

Abstract: Although many molecular regulators of morphogenesis have been identified in plants, it remains largely unknown how the molecular networks influence local cell shape and how cell growth, form, and position are coordinated during tissue and organ formations. So far, analyses of gene function in morphogenesis have mainly focused on the qualitative analysis of phenotypes, often providing limited mechanistic insight into how particular factors act. For this reason, there has been a growing interest in mathematical and computational models to formalize and test hypotheses. These require much more rigorous, quantitative approaches; in parallel, new quantitative and correlative imaging pipelines have been developed to study morphogenesis. Here, we describe a number of such methods, focusing on live imaging.

Abstract: Background
Therapy application and monitoring of patients with hemophilia A (HA) and inhibitors are challenging. In the current study, combined FVIII – bypass therapy was implemented for a cohort of severe HA patients with inhibitors.
Methods
Plasma of 15 HA patients with inhibitors was spiked ex vivo with FVIII, rFVIIa, FEIBA and their combinations and thrombin generation (TG) was studied. Some patients who experienced hemarthroses or required minor surgeries were treated by a combined concomitant administration of FVIII+FEIBA as IV bolus doses.
Results
TG spiking studies showed individual responses not correlated to inhibitor titer. Combinations of agents augmented TG as compared to any single agent, while combined FVIII+FEIBA yielded the highest TG, supporting it as a potential treatment. Following emergent successful surgery of child treated by concomitant FVIII+FEIBA, a total of 396 episodes in 7/15 patients were treated with concomitant FVIII+FEIBA. Five patients were treated for bleeding episodes only, whereas 2 were children undergoing immune tolerance induction (ITI) with FEIBA prophylaxis. Four minor surgeries were performed on FVIII+FEIBA repeated infusions. Neither thrombosis nor any other adverse events were documented.
Conclusion
A combination of FVIII+FEIBA may be effective and safe as an alternative treatment option for some high-responding inhibitor patients.

Abstract: The transepithelial or -endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) is a very common and routinely recorded parameter describing the expression of barrier-forming cell-cell contacts (tight junctions) in quantitative terms. To determine TEER, barrier-forming cell monolayers are cultured on porous filter supports that separate two fluid compartments. The frequency-dependent impedance of the cell layer is then recorded and analyzed by means of equivalent circuit modelling providing TEER and the cell layer capacitance. The latter serves as a quantitative indicator for membrane topography. When cells are co-cultured on opposite sides of such a porous support to model more complex biological barriers, TEER readings will integrate over both cell layers and the individual contributions are not assessable. This study describes the modification of commonly used porous filter inserts by coating their backside with a thin gold-film. When this gold-film is used as an additional electrode, both cell layers can be studied separately by impedance analysis. The electrical parameters of either cell layer are assessable independently by switching between different electrode combinations. The performance of this new approach is illustrated and documented by experiments that (i) follow the de novo formation of cell junctions between initially suspended cells and (ii) the manipulation of mature cell-cell junctions by cytoskeleton-active drugs. Both assays confirm that both cell layers are monitored entirely independently.

Abstract: Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) has a central role in primary hemostasis. Its biological activity is related to the size of VWF multimers, spontaneously binding to platelets and inducing circulating microthrombi formation. This process is down-regulated by the VWF cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin motif). To date, information regarding the levels of ADAMTS13 in neonates and preterm infants is scarce. Our aim was to study ADAMTS13, VWF antigen (Ag) and Ristocetin cofactor (RiCof) activity in neonates and evaluate potential correlations with perinatal complications. Our cohort consisted of 128 (48/128: born preterm) neonates, born in Sheba Medical Center and followed until hospital discharge. Control group consisted of 20 healthy adults. As expected, a significant elevation of VWF:Ag was observed in preterm and term infants compared to adults. VWF:Ag levels were highest in full term infants (Median 129.0 IQR 33.8) and lowest in adults (Median 119.0 IQR 58.5) (p<0.05), and RiCoF levels in neonates were higher than in adults. ADAMTS13 was significantly (p<0.05) higher in preterm babies in comparison to full term and adult controls. Neonates that underwent stressful conditions or experienced vascular complications such as IUGR, ROP, NEC, had lower levels of ADAMTS13 in our study. Further studies are required to validate and asses potential significance of these findings.

Abstract: Epithelial cells forming mammary gland ducts and alveoli require adhesion to the extracellular matrix for their function. Mammary epithelial cells need β1-integrins for normal cell cycle regulation. However, the role of β1-integrins in tumorigenesis has not been fully resolved. β1-integrin is necessary for tumour formation in transgenic mice expressing the Polyomavirus Middle T antigen, but it is dispensable in those overexpressing ErbB2. This suggests that some oncogenes can manage without β1-integrin to proliferate and form tumours, while others still require it. Here we have developed a model to test whether expression of an oncogene can surpass the need for β1-integrin to drive proliferation. We co-expressed the ErbB2 or Akt oncogenes with shRNA to target β1-integrin in mammary epithelial cells, and found that they show a differential dependence on β1-integrin for cell division. Moreover, we identified a key proliferative role of the Rac1-Pak axis downstream of β1-integrin signalling. Our data suggest that, in mammary epithelial cells, oncogenes with the ability to signal to Pak surpass the requirement of integrins for malignant transformation. This highlights the importance of using the correct combination therapy for breast cancer, depending on the oncogenes expressed in the tumour.

Abstract: Cross-presentation of foreign antigen in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I by dendritic cells (DCs) requires activation of the NADPH-oxidase NOX2 complex. We recently showed that NOX2 is recruited to phagosomes by the SNARE protein VAMP8 where NOX2-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause lipid oxidation and membrane disruption, promoting antigen translocation into the cytosol for cross-presentation. In this study, we extend these findings by showing that VAMP8 is also involved in NOX2 trafficking to endosomes. Moreover, we demonstrate in both human and mouse DCs that absence of VAMP8 leads to decreased ROS production, lipid peroxidation and antigen translocation, and that this impairs cross-presentation. In contrast, knockdown of VAMP8 did not affect recruitment of MHC class I and the transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) to phagosomes, although surface levels of MHC class I were reduced. Thus, in addition to a secretory role, VAMP8-mediates trafficking of NOX2 to endosomes and phagosomes and this promotes induction of cytolytic T cell immune responses.

Abstract: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease, especially in children, characterized by intravascular hemolysis, thrombotic events, serious infections and bone marrow failure. We describe 16 patients who were diagnosed with PNH in childhood or adolescence. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and the PNH diagnosis and its treatment were compared in patients with classic PNH versus PNH associated with bone marrow disorder (PNH/BMD). A greater delay in diagnosis was observed in classic PNH compared to PNH/BMD patients. The first group of patients had higher levels of LDH, total bilirubin and absolute reticulocyte count and a bigger PNH clone size compared to PNH/BMD patients; also thrombotic events were observed only in the classic form of PNH. Conversely, PNH/BMD patients showed lower median levels of platelets. Apart from standard supportive measures, four patients with classic PNH received eculizumab whereas four patients with PNH/BMD underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Our series confirm that the most frequent presentation of PNH in the pediatric-adolescent age is PNH/BMD. The delay between the onset of symptoms and PNH diagnosis is relevant principally in the classic form. Moreover, our study showed that any case of unexpected thrombosis represents a criterium to perform a PNH screening.

Abstract: The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum produces and secretes multilamellar bodies (MLBs) mainly composed of amoebal membranes upon digestion of bacteria. After their secretion, the fate of these MLBs remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if protozoa can internalize and digest secreted D. discoideum MLBs. Our results showed that MLBs were ingested by naive axenic D. discoideum cells (i. e. cells not exposed to bacteria and consequently not producing MLBs). Only a small fraction of the ingested MLBs were found in cells’ post-lysosomes compared to undigestible beads suggesting that naive amoebae digest them. D. discoideum MLBs were also ingested by the ciliates Tetrahymena pyriformis and Tetrahymena thermophila. MLBs internalized by the ciliates were compacted into pellets and expelled in the extracellular medium without obvious signs of degradation. The results of this study provide new insights on the biological function of MLBs and, considering that MLBs are also involved in bacteria packaging, suggest additional layers of complexity in microbial interactions.

Abstract: The WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) links upstream Rho-family GTPase signaling to the activation of the ARP2/3 complex in different organisms. WRC-induced and ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation beneath the plasma membrane is critical for actin assembly in the leading edge to drive efficient cell migration. The WRC is a stable heteropentamer composed of SCAR/WAVE, Abi, Nap, Pir and the small polypeptide Brk1/Hspc300. Functional interference with individual subunits of the complex frequently results in diminished amounts of the remaining polypeptides of the WRC complex, implying the complex to act as molecular entity. However, Abi was also found to associate with mammalian N-WASP, formins, Eps8/SOS1 or VASP, indicating additional functions of individual WRC subunits in eukaryotic cells. To address this issue systematically, we inactivated all WRC subunits, either alone or in combination with VASP in Dictyostelium cells and quantified the protein content of the remaining subunits in respective WRC knockouts. The individual mutants displayed highly differential phenotypes concerning various parameters, including cell morphology, motility, cytokinesis or multicellular development, corroborating the view of additional roles for individual subunits, beyond their established function in WRC-mediated Arp2/3 complex activation. Finally, our data uncover the interaction of the actin polymerase VASP with WRC-embedded Abi to mediate VASP accumulation in cell protrusions, driving efficient cell migration.

Abstract: Tissue morphogenesis is governed by mechanical forces generated by cell cytoskeletal networks. It has been shown that subcellular forces are responsible for cell shape changes. Nevertheless cells in a developing organism do not act in isolation: cells contact and adhere one another, and forces are transmitted from cell-to-cell throughout tissues. Understanding how forces are integrated at the tissue level and finally at the full animal scale is nowadays a major challenge that will allow shedding new light on how embryo morphogenesis takes place. In this chapter, I present a new laser-based technique to probe tissue coupling in a living Drosophila embryo. Such technique allows generating mechanical fix boundaries that can eventually impair or modulate cell flows and tissue displacements to probe tissue interaction.

Abstract: Cytokinesis is a process by which a mother cell is divided into two daughter cells after chromosome segregation. In both animal and fungal cells, cytokinesis is carried out by the constriction of the contractile ring made up of actin, myosin-II, and other conserved proteins. Detailed genetic and cell biological analysis of cytokinesis has led to the identification of various genes involved in the process of cytokinesis including the cytological description of the process. However, detailed biochemical analysis of the process is lacking. Critical questions that aim to understand aspects, such as the organization of actin and myosin in the contractile ring, the architecture of the ring, and the molecular process of ring contraction, remain unanswered. We have developed a method to address these aspects of cytokinesis. Using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we present a method whereby cell-ghosts containing functional contractile rings can be isolated and used to perform various biochemical analysis as well as detailed electron microscopy studies.

Abstract: OCT4 is a major regulator of pluripotency which has several spliced variants and expressed pseudogenes. Here, we are reporting the existence of two additional novel spliced variants of OCT4, OCT4C and OCT4C1, which lack Exon1 (E1) but start at a novel exon (E0) located ∼14kb upstream of E2. OCT4C/C1 is highly expressed in ES and iPS cells, and their expression was sharply turned off, upon the induction of neural differentiation. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PSORS1C3, is located ∼9kb downstream of the E0 of OCT4C/C1. PSORS1C3 is vigorously spliced to generate nine novel variants, however, none of its exons incorporated in alternatively spliced variants of OCT4. Interestingly, the exons of OCT4 and PSORS1C3 are intertwined, with a novel exon (E0) of PSORS1C3 located ∼4kb upstream of OCT4 E0. This exon participates in generating some more variants of PSORS1C3 (variants 10–24). OCT4C/C1 knock-down in ES and iPS cell lines caused a slight downregulation of PSORS1C3 and OCT4A, a slight upregulation of OCT4B1, and a dramatic upregulation of OCT4B. Altogether, our data revisited the current view of OCT4 gene structure and regulation, and revealed its complex genomic features and expression regulation in stem and tumor cells.

Abstract: It is unclear whether vascular function is affected similarly in children with sickle cell anaemia (SS) and children with sickle haemoglobin C (SC) disease. Therefore, we compared micro and macrovascular functions in healthy (AA) children, children with SS and SC disease, and assessed their association with physical activity. Participants (24 SS, 22 SC and 16 AA), were compared in terms of 1) thermal hyperaemic response (finger pad warming to 42°C) measured by Laser Doppler techniques, 2) arterial stiffness determined by pulse wave velocity, 3) daily energy expenditure related to moderate and intense physical activities estimated by questionnaire and 4) fitness level, evaluated by the six-minute walk test. Response to heating differed between SS, SC and controls. Peripheral microvascular reactivity was lower and pulse wave velocity higher in SS compared to AA. SC had blunted microvascular reactivity in response to heating compared to AA but pulse wave velocity was not different within the two groups. Physical activity and fitness levels were markedly lower in sickle cell patients compared to healthy controls but no association was observed with vascular function. Microvasodilatory reserve is decreased in both SS and SC patients but only SS patients were also characterised by impaired macrovascular function.

Abstract: Resveratrol (RSV), a natural polyphenol component, has diverse biological properties. It has been shown that RSV regulated the self-renewal and differentiation of several types of stem cells, but the precise role of this compound on regulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) self- renewal remained to be elucidated. Here we have shown that RSV promoted hESCs proliferation through cell cycle modulation and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic markers, without affecting pluripotency. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by EX-527 resulted in suppression of RSV-induced enhancement of hESCs self-renewal. RSV exerted its beneficial effects by activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway as verified by application of specific MEK inhibitor, PD0325901. In conclusion, RSV elevated self-renewal of hESCs at least partly via “SIRT1-MEK/ERK” axis. These findings provide a novel application of RSV for developing a defined medium for hESCs culture which could help to better understanding of the signaling events that govern self-renewal of hESCs.

Abstract: Osteogenic differentiation is regulated through multiple signaling networks that may include responses to hypoxia. Antioxidant ferulic acid (FA) can promote hypoxia signaling by inducing hypoxic-induced factor (HIF). However, whether FA could affect osteogenesis has not been explored. We examined human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) following FA treatment. The expression of β-catenin was measured, and candidate microRNAs that target β-catenin were studied. The involvement of hypoxia was investigated in miR-340-5p that contains hypoxia response elements (HRE) in the promoter region. Further, the osteogenic potential of FA-treated MSC was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and alizarin red staining assays. Osteoblast marker gene expressions were also compared between controls and FA-treated cells. FA induced β-catenin expression in MSC. This effect is likely mediated through a derepression of β-catenin 3′-UTR inhibition by miR-340-5p. HIF-1α, which suppressed miR-340-5p promoter activation through HRE motifs, was induced by FA. The induction of β-catenin signaling by FA was consistent with an enhancement in osteogenesis of FA-treated MSC, which could be attenuated by miR-340-5p overexpression. Analysis of the signaling networks induced by FA reveals that hypoxia may promote the osteogenic program in mesenchymal stem cells via a novel microRNA pathway.

Abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders related to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell dysfunction. Several studies have shown the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in regulating hematopoietic stem, and progenitor function and their individual abnormalities have been associated with disease pathogenesis. In this study, we simultaneously evaluated hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) and different stromal elements in a cohort of patients with MDS-refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD). Karyotyping of these patients revealed variable chromosomal abnormalities in 73.33% of patients. Long-term HSC and lineage-negative CD34+CD38− cells were reduced while among the HPCs, there was an expansion of common myeloid progenitor and loss of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. Interestingly, loss of HSCs was accompanied by aberrant frequencies of endothelial (ECs) (CD31+CD45−CD71−) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (CD31−CD45−71−) and its subsets associated with HSC niche. We further demonstrate down-regulation of HSC maintenance genes such as Cxcl12, VEGF in mesenchymal cells and a parallel upregulation in endothelial cells. Altogether we report for the first time quantitative and qualitative de novo changes in hematopoietic stem and its associated niche in a cohort of MDS-RCMD patients. These findings further reinforce the role of different components of the bone marrow microenvironment in MDS pathogenesis and emphasize the need for comprehensive simultaneous evaluation of all niche elements in such studies.

Abstract: Liver is crucial in the homeostasis of glycerol, an important metabolic intermediate. Plasma glycerol is imported by hepatocytes mainly through Aquaporin-9 (AQP9), an aquaglyceroporin channel negatively regulated by insulin in rodents. AQP9 is of critical importance in glycerol metabolism since hepatic glycerol utilization is rate-limited at the hepatocyte membrane permeation step. Glycerol kinase catalyzes the initial step for the conversion of the imported glycerol into glycerol-3-phosphate, a major substrate for de novo synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis) and/or triacyglycerols (lipogenesis). A model addressing the glucose-insulin system to describe the hepatic glycerol import and metabolism and the correlation with the glucose homeostasis is lacking so far. Here we consider a system of first-order ordinary differential equations delineating the relevance of hepatocyte AQP9 in liver glycerol permeability. Assuming the hepatic glycerol permeability as depending on the protein levels of AQP9, a mathematical function is designed describing the time course of the involvement of AQP9 in mouse hepatic glycerol metabolism in different nutritional states. The resulting theoretical relationship is derived fitting experimental data obtained with murine models at the fed, fasted or re-fed condition. While providing useful insights into the dynamics of liver AQP9 involvement in male rodent glycerol homeostasis our model may be adapted to the human liver serving as an important module of a whole body-model of the glucose metabolism both in health and metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Invadopodia are ventral membrane protrusions formed by cancer cells that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) during tumor invasion and metastasis. Formation of invadopodia is initiated by the assembly of actin filaments (F-actin) that results from the coordinated activation of several actin regulatory proteins. Actinin-1 and actinin-4 are actin bundling proteins expressed in non-muscle cells and actinin-4 is preferentially associated with malignant phenotypes of carcinoma cells. In this study, we investigated the role of actinin-1 and −4 in invadopodia formation. Expression of both actinin-1 and −4 tended to be higher in invasive and metastatic breast carcinoma cell lines than in non-invasive ones. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that actinin-1 and −4 colocalized at core actin structures of invadopodia. Time-lapse imaging showed that appearance of both actinins at invadopodia is concomitant with the assembly of F-actin. Knockdown of either actinin-1 or actinin-4 suppressed the formation of invadopodia and degradation of the ECM by carcinoma cells. Interestingly, overexpression of actinin-4, but not actinin-1, significantly promoted the formation of invadopodia and this activity required the actin binding domains and the unique N-terminal motif that exists only in actinin-4. These results demonstrate that both actinin-1 and actinin-4 participate in the assembly of F-actin at invadopodia. Additionally, actinin-4 may have a selective advantage in accelerating invadopodia-mediated invasion of carcinoma cells.

Abstract: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon neurological disease with high morbidity and mortality. Even after extensive thrombophilia screening, majority of the thrombosis cases remain with unknown etiology. Hypofibrinolysis due to acquired or congenital deficiencies or abnormalities in factors in the fibrinolytic cascade is a known cause of thrombosis at any site. In the present study 104 cases of radiologically confirmed CVT cases were investigated for the conventional thrombophilia along with factors in the fibrinolytic cascade to find a possible etiology for the clinical manifestation. Conventional thrombophilia markers which included PC, PS, AT and FVL mutation were detected in 16.3% of the patients. Approximately 19% cases had grossly elevated plasma PAI-1 levels. PAI-1 4G/4G genotype was found to be strongly associated with high PAI-1 levels. 2.9% cases had reduced tPA levels, 1.9% had plasminogen deficiency and 1.9% cases had increased alpha-2-antiplasmin levels. Along with conventional thrombophilia, dysfunctional fibrinolysis is found to be strongly associated with CVT. Understanding the role of risk factors is important for appropriate treatment of this serious disorder.

Abstract: The functional properties of actin-regulating formin proteins are diverse and in many cases cell-type specific. FHOD1, a formin expressed predominantly in cells of mesenchymal lineage, bundles actin filaments and participates in maintenance of cell shape, migration and cellular protrusions. FHOD1 participates in cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in oral squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. The role of FHOD1 in melanomas has not been characterized. Here, we show that FHOD1 expression is typically strong in cutaneous melanomas and cultured melanoma cells while the expression is low or absent in benign nevi. By using shRNA to knockdown FHOD1 in melanoma cells, we discovered that FHOD1 depleted cells are larger, rounder and have smaller focal adhesions and inferior migratory capacity as compared to control cells. Importantly, we found FHOD1 depleted cells to have reduced colony-forming capacity and attenuated tumor growth in vivo, a finding best explained by the reduced proliferation rate caused by cell cycle arrest. Unexpectedly, FHOD1 depletion did not prevent invasive growth at the tumor margins. These results suggest that FHOD1 participates in key cellular processes that are dysregulated in malignancy, but may not be essential for melanoma cell invasion.

We prepared both drug-treated early C. elegans embryos and fluorescently labeled sea urchin embryos of Lytechinus pictus for ultrastructural studies on animal cytokinesis. Here we focus on the initial preparation steps of postmitotic embryos for high-pressure freezing and subsequent electron microscopy with an emphasis on electron tomography. The advantages and limitations of our extended protocol will be discussed.

Abstract: Rare diseases are defined as life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases with a prevalence of less than one per 2000 according to the European Union or one per 1250 according to the USA. Congenital rare bleeding disorders RBD are reported in most populations, with incidence varying from 1 in 5000 (Hemophilia A), 1:30,000 (Hemophilia B) to much rarer (1:500,000 for FVII deficiency, 1–3 million for Prothrombin or FXIII deficiency). Acquired Hemophilia A is also a rare bleeding disorder with estimated frequency of 1 in million. Most RBDs are inherited as autosomal recessive (AR); however, heterozygous carriers with varying degrees of corresponding factor deficiency may render an unpredictable propensity for bleeding. In patients with bleeding symptoms, laboratory assessment and especially molecular techniques currently enable accurate diagnosis and may provide tools for prenatal and family counseling. Currently hemostasis control is mainly based upon replacement of the missing coagulation factors (unless presence of inhibitors renders it impossible), however future gene therapy and disruptive, non-replacement alternatives may be promising for patients with RBD.

Abstract: Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are capable of multi-lineage differentiation and support regenerative processes. In bacterial infections, resident MSC can come intocontact with and need to react to bacterial components. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a typical structure of Gram-negative bacteria, increases the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSC. LPS is usually recognized by the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and induces pro-inflammatory reactions in numerous cell types. In this study, we quantified the protein expression of TLR4 and CD14 on adipose-derived MSC (adMSC) in osteogenic differentiation and investigated the effect of TLR4 activation by LPS on NF-κB activation, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of adMSC. We found that TLR4 is expressed on adMSC whereas CD14 is not, and that osteogenic differentiation induced an increase of the amount of TLR4 protein whereas LPS stimulation did not. Moreover, we could show that NF-κB activation via TLR4 occurs upon LPS treatment. Furthermore, we were able to show that competitive inhibition of TLR4 completely abolished the stimulatory effect of LPS on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of adMSC. In addition, the inhibition of TLR4 leads to the complete absence of osteogenic differentiation of adMSC, even when osteogenically stimulated. Thus, we conclude that LPS induces proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of adMSC in vitro through the activation of TLR4 and that the TLR4 receptor seems to play a role during osteogenic differentiation of adMSC.
