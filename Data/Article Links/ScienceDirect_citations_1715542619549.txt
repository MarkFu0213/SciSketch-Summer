Abstract: Impaired wound healing represents one of the most debilitating side effects of Diabetes mellitus. Though the role of fibroblasts in wound healing is well-known, the extent to which their function is altered in the context of diabetes remains incompletely understood. Here, we address this question by comparing the phenotypes of healthy dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and diabetic dermal fibroblasts (DDFs). We show that DDFs are more elongated but less motile and less contractile than HDFs. Reduced motility of DDFs is attributed to formation of larger focal adhesions stabilized by a bulky glycocalyx, associated with increased expression of the cell surface glycoprotein mucin 16 (MUC 16). Disruption of the glycocalyx not only restored DDF motility to levels comparable to that of HDFs, but also led to increased proliferation and collagen synthesis. Collectively, our results illustrate the influence of glycocalyx disruption on mechanics of diabetic fibroblasts relevant to cell motility.

Abstract: WD repeat and HMG-box DNA binding protein 1 (Wdhd1) is the mouse ortholog of budding yeast Chromosome Transmission Fidelity 4 (CTF4), the protein product of which integrates the MCM2–7 helicase and DNA polymerase α/primase complex to initiate DNA replication. Previous work in fruit flies, Xenopus egg extracts, and human cell lines suggest that Wdhd1 is required for efficient DNA synthesis. However, rigorous in vivo functional studies on Wdhd1 in mammals are unavailable. In the present study, we have successfully generated a Wdhd1 null allele in mice through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to investigate the role of Wdhd1 in embryogenesis in vivo. We characterized Wdhd1 expression using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and assessed embryonic cell proliferation by histology in both pre- and peri-implantation embryos. While Wdhd1 heterozygous mutant mice were grossly normal and fertile, we observed a reduction in cell proliferation by the gastrulation stage in Wdhd1 homozygous null mutant embryos which severely hampered their growth and viability. These results indicate that Wdhd1 plays a major role in cell proliferation during embryogenesis in mice.

Abstract: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) can reportedly centrally affect the thermogenesis of brown fat. However, whether the peripheral IL-6 signaling regulates beiging of white fat remains largely unknown. In vitro experiments indicated IL-6-KO-derived white adipocytes exhibited lower thermogenic gene expression compared to the WT, associating with reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705. Mechanistically, exogenous IL-6 application increased the p-STAT3Tyr705 level, thus the phosphorylated STAT3 bound to the promoter regions, and enhanced the transcription of Pparγ and Ucp1. The protein interaction of PGC-1α with PPARγ was increased by IL-6, which also contributed to stimulate Ucp1 expression. In vivo experiments demonstrated that IL-6 KO decreased the beiging potential of white fat with suppressed STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. Accordingly, IL-6-KO mature mice were associated with disrupted glucose homeostasis and accelerated hepatic steatosis. Collectively, we identified a novel function of peripheral IL-6/STAT3 signaling which is essential for beiging of white fat, such ensuring fat and glucose homeostasis.

Abstract: Pancreatic β cells are essential in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis during the progression to type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), generating compensatory hyperinsulinemia to counteract insulin resistance. It is well known, that throughout the process there is an increased mTORC1 signaling pathway, with an impairment in different quality control systems including ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. In addition, under this situation, pancreatic β cells start to accumulate amylin protein (IAPP) in aggregates, and this accumulation contributes to the failure of autophagy, damaging different organelles such as plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and others. Here, we report that IAPP can be incorporated to multivesicular bodies (MVB) and secreted into exosomes, a mechanism responsible for the exportation of these toxic aggregates as vehicles of cell to cell communication. On this regard, we have demonstrated that the exosomes bearing toxic hIAPP released from pancreatic β cells are capable to induce hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling, a failure in the autophagic cellular quality control, and favor pro-fission status of the mitochondrial dynamics in hippocampal cells. In summary, our results show that harmful accumulation of hIAPP in pancreatic β cells may be detoxified by the release of exosomes, which may be captured by endocytosis mechanism damaging neuronal hippocampal cells, which suggest an underlying molecular mechanism to the link between type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is an aggressive disease characterized by late clinical presentation, large tumor size, treatment resistance and low survival rate. Expression of EGFR/HER2 and activation of intracellular tyrosine kinase domains in LABC are associated with poor prognosis. Thus, target therapies such as the anti-receptor tyrosine kinases lapatinib drug have been more developed in the past decade. The response to lapatinib involves the inhibition of RTKs and subsequently signaling molecules such as Src/STAT3/Erk1/2 known also to be activated by the cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The aim of the present study is to identify the major cytokine that might contribute to lapatinib resistance in EGFR+/HER2+ LABC patients. Indeed, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main source of cytokines in the TME. Herein, we isolated TAMs from LABC during modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Cytokine profile of TAMs revealed that IL-8 is the most prominent highly secreted cytokine by TAMs of LABC patients. Using in-vitro cell culture model we showed that recombinant IL-8 (50 and 100 ng/mL) at different time intervals interfere with lapatinib action via activation of Src/EGFR and signaling molecules known to be inhibited during treatment. We proposed that to improve LABC patients' response to lapatinib treatment it is preferred to use combined therapy that neutralize or block the action of IL-8.

Abstract: In addition to its uptake across the Ca2+ uniporter, intracellular calcium signals can stimulate mitochondrial metabolism activating metabolite exchangers of the inner mitochondrial membrane belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family (SLC25). One of these Ca2+-regulated mitochondrial carriers (CaMCs) are the reversible ATP-Mg2+/Pi transporters, or SCaMCs, required for maintaining optimal adenine nucleotide (AdN) levels in the mitochondrial matrix representing an alternative transporter to the ADP/ATP translocases (AAC). This CaMC has a distinctive Calmodulin-like (CaM-like) domain fused to the carrier domain that makes its transport activity strictly dependent on cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Here we investigate about its origin analysing its distribution and features in unicellular eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, we find two types of ATP-Mg2+/Pi carriers, the canonical ones and shortened variants lacking the CaM-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis shows that both SCaMC variants have a common origin, unrelated to AACs, suggesting in turn that recurrent losses of the regulatory module have occurred in the different phyla. They are excluding variants that show a more limited distribution and less conservation than AACs. Interestingly, these truncated variants of SCaMC are found almost exclusively in parasitic protists, such as apicomplexans, kinetoplastides or animal-patogenic oomycetes, and in green algae, suggesting that its lost could be related to certain life-styles. In addition, we find an intricate structural diversity in these variants that may be associated with their pathogenicity. The consequences on SCaMC functions of these new SCaMC-b variants are discussed.

Abstract: Biomolecular condensation through phase separation may be a novel mechanism to regulate bacterial processes, including cell division. Previous work revealed that FtsZ, a protein essential for cytokinesis in most bacteria, forms biomolecular condensates with SlmA, a protein that protects the chromosome from damage inflicted by the division machinery in Escherichia coli. The absence of condensates composed solely of FtsZ under the conditions used in that study suggested this mechanism was restricted to nucleoid occlusion by SlmA or to bacteria containing this protein. Here we report that FtsZ alone, under physiologically relevant conditions, can demix into condensates in bulk and when encapsulated in synthetic cell-like systems generated by microfluidics. Condensate assembly depends on FtsZ being in the GDP-bound state and on conditions mimicking the crowded environment of the cytoplasm that promote its oligomerization. Condensates are dynamic and reversibly convert into filaments upon GTP addition. Notably, FtsZ lacking its C-terminal disordered region, a structural element likely to favor biomolecular condensation, also forms condensates, albeit less efficiently. The inherent tendency of FtsZ to form condensates susceptible to modulation by physiological factors, including binding partners, suggests that such mechanisms may play a more general role in bacterial division than initially envisioned.

Abstract: VHL encodes a tumour suppressor, which possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in complex with EloC and Cul2. In tumour cells or in response to hypoxia, VHL activity is lost, causing accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-1alpha. In this study, we demonstrated that in Drosophila, Rpn9, a regulatory component of the 26 s proteasome, participates in the Vhl-induced proteasomal degradation of sima, the Drosophila orthologue of HIF-1alpha. Knockdown of Vhl induces increased melanisation in the adult fly thorax and concurrent decrease in pigmentation in the abdomen. Both these defects are rescued by knockdown of sima and partially by knockdown of cnc, which encodes the fly orthologue of the transcription factor Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress response. We further show that sima overexpression and Rpn9 knockdown both result in post-translational down-regulation of the copper uptake transporter Ctr1A in the fly eye and that Ctr1A expression exacerbates Vhl knockdown defects in the thorax and rescues these defects in the abdomen. We conclude that Vhl negatively regulates both sima and cnc and that in the absence of Vhl, these transcription factors interact to regulate Ctr1A, copper uptake and consequently melanin formation. We propose a model whereby the co-regulatory relationship between sima and cnc flips between thorax and abdomen: in the thorax, sima is favoured leading to upregulation of Ctr1A; in the abdomen, cnc dominates, resulting in the post-translational downregulation of Ctr1A.

Abstract: Normal-to-tumor cell transition is accompanied by changes in gene expression and signal transduction that turns the balance toward cancer-cell phenotype, eluding by different mechanisms, the response of tumor-suppressor genes. Here, we observed that MageC2, a MAGE-I protein able to regulate the p53 tumor-suppressor, is accumulated upon MEK/ERK MAPK activation. Overexpression of H-RasV12 oncogene causes an increase in MageC2 protein that is prevented by pharmacologic inhibition of MEK. Similarly, decrease in MageC2 protein levels is shown in A375 melanoma cells (which harbor B-RafV600E oncogenic mutation) treated with MEK inhibitors. MageC2 protein levels decrease when p14ARF is expressed, causing an Mdm2-independent upregulation of p53 transactivation. However, MageC2 is refractory to p14ARF-driven downregulation when H-RasV12 is co-expressed. Using MageC2 knockout A375 cells generated by CRISPR/CAS9 technology, we demonstrated the relevance of MageC2 protein in reducing p53 transcriptional activity in cells containing hyperactive MEK/ERK signaling. Furthermore, gene expression analysis performed in cancer-genomic databases, supports the correlation of reduced p53 transcriptional activity and high MageC2 expression, in melanoma cells containing Ras or B-Raf driver mutations. Data presented here suggest that MageC2 can be a functional target of the oncogenic MEK/ERK pathway to regulate p53.

Abstract: HIPK2 is a highly conserved, constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase that is involved in a broad spectrum of biological processes. We have previously reported that the expression of HIPK2 is auto-regulated by a mechanism that depends on the activity of its kinase domain, leading to decreased expression of kinase-dead versus wild-type HIPK2. We have now explored this mechanism in more detail. Differential expression of wild-type and kinase-dead HIPK2 is dependent on sequences located in the C-terminal part of HIPK2, but is only observed when this part of HIPK2 is translated together with the defective kinase domain. On their own, both the defective kinase domain and the C-terminal amino acid sequences are expressed at normal levels and independently of kinase activity. Insertion of a 2A-ribosomal skipping sequence into the HIPK2 coding sequence revealed that the differential expression of wild-type and kinase-dead HIPK2 is caused by degradation of nascent kinase-dead HIPK2. Because HIPK2 is constitutively active and auto-activates its kinase domain already during its translation we speculate that the regulatory mechanism discovered here serves as a quality control mechanism that leads to degradation of nascent kinase molecules with defective kinase domains. Overall our work provides insight into a novel auto-regulatory mechanism of HIPK2 expression, thereby adding a new layer of control to the regulation of HIPK2.

Abstract: BRET and fluorescence anisotropy (FA) are two fluorescence-based techniques used for the characterization of ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and both allow monitoring of ligand binding in real time. In this study, we present the first direct comparison of BRET-based and FA-based binding assays using the human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) and two TAMRA (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled fluorescent ligands as a model system. The determined fluorescent ligand affinities from both assays were in good agreement with results obtained from radioligand competition binding experiments. The assays yielded real-time kinetic binding data revealing differences in the mechanism of binding for the investigated fluorescent probes. Furthermore, the investigation of various unlabeled M2R ligands yielded pharmacological profiles in accordance with earlier reported data. Taken together, this study showed that BRET- and FA-based binding assays represent valuable alternatives to radioactivity-based methods for screening purposes and for a precise characterization of binding kinetics supporting the exploration of binding mechanisms.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to possess pro-hypertrophic properties in the heart, but the detailed molecular mechanism that underlies the pathological process is rarely explored. In the present study, we aim to explore the role of S1P-mediated intracellular Ca2+ signaling, with a focus on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-mitochondria communication, in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) displayed significantly hypertrophic growth after treatment with 1 μmol/L S1P for 48 h, as indicated by the cell surface area or mRNA expressions of hypertrophic marker genes (ANP, BNP and β-MHC). Importantly, mitochondrial Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were dramatically elevated upon S1P stimulation, and pharmacological blockage of which abolished NRVM hypertrophy. 0.5 Hz electrical pacing induced similar cytosolic Ca2+ kinetics to S1P stimulation, but unaffected the peak of mitochondrial [Ca2+]. With interference of the expression of type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R2), which are unemployed in electrical paced Ca2+ activity but may be activated by S1P, alteration in mitochondrial Ca2+ as well as the hypertrophic effect in NRVMs under S1P stimulation were attenuated. The hypertrophic effect of S1P can also be abolished by pharmacological block of S1PR1 or Gi signaling. Collectively, our study highlights the mechanistic role of IP3R2-mediated excess SR-mitochondria Ca2+ transport in S1P-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Abstract: Degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins is essential for normal cellular homeostasis. In eukaryotes, such unstable cellular proteins are selectively degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Abnormalities in protein degradation by the UPS have been linked to several human diseases. Ccr4, Caf1, and Not4 proteins are known components of the Ccr4-Not multimeric complex. Ccr4 and Caf1 have established roles in transcription, mRNA de-adenylation and RNA degradation etc., while Not4 was shown to have important roles in regulating translation and protein quality control pathways. Here we show that Ccr4, Caf1, and Not4 have a novel function at a post-ubiquitylation step in the UPS pathway by promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of short-lived proteins by the 26S proteasome. Using a substrate of the well-studied ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway, we found that its UPS-mediated degradation was severely impaired upon deletion of CCR4, CAF1, or NOT4 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additionally, we show that Ccr4, Caf1, and Not4 bind to cellular ubiquitin conjugates, and that Ccr4 and Caf1 proteins interact with the proteasome. In contrast to Ccr4, Caf1, and Not4, other subunits of the Ccr4-Not complex are dispensable for UFD substrate degradation. From our findings we conclude that the Ccr4-Not complex subunits Ccr4, Caf1, and Not4 have a novel function outside of the canonical Ccr4-Not complex as a factor targeting ubiquitylated substrates for proteasomal degradation.

Abstract: We analysed spatiotemporal properties of Ca2+ signals in protoplasmic astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum of hippocampal slices from young (2–3 months old) mice housed in control conditions or exposed to a caloric restriction (CR) diet for one month. The astrocytic Ca2+ events became shorter in duration and smaller in size; they also demonstrated reduced velocity of expansion and shrinkage following CR. At the same time, Ca2+ signals in the astrocytes from the CR animals demonstrated higher amplitude and the faster rise and decay rates. These changes can be attributed to CR-induced morphological remodelling and uncoupling of astrocytes described in our previous study. CR-induced changes in the parameters of Ca2+ activity were partially reversed by inhibition of gap junctions/hemichannels with carbenoxolone (CBX). The effect of CBX on Ca2+ activity in CR-animals was unexpected because the diet already decreases gap junctional coupling in astrocytic syncytia. It may reflect the blockade of hemichannels also sensitive to this drug. Thus, CR-induced morphological remodelling of astrocytes is at least partly responsible for changes in the pattern of Ca2+ activity in the astrocytic network. How such changes in spatiotemporal Ca2+ landscape can translate into astrocytic physiology and neuron-glia interactions remains a matter for future studies.

Abstract: The protein lysine methyltransferase, SMYD2 is involved in diverse cellular events by regulating protein functions through lysine methylation. Though several substrate proteins of SMYD2 are well-studied, only a limited number of its interaction partners have been identified and characterized. Here, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of SMYD2 and found that the ribosomal protein, eL21 could interact with SMYD2. SMYD2-eL21 interaction in the human cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation methods. In vitro pull-down assays revealed that SMYD2 interacts with eL21 directly through its SET and MYND domain. Computational mapping, followed by experimental studies identified that Lys81 and Lys83 residues of eL21 are important for the SMYD2-eL21 interaction. Evolutionary analysis showed that these residues might have co-evolved with the emergence of SMYD2. We found that eL21 regulates the steady state levels of SMYD2 by promoting its transcription and inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. Importantly, SMYD2-eL21 interaction plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and its dysregulation might lead to tumorigenesis. Our findings highlight a novel extra-ribosomal function of eL21 on regulating SMYD2 levels and imply that ribosomal proteins might regulate wide range of cellular functions through protein-protein interactions in addition to their core function in translation.

Abstract: DNAJC5 (DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5), also known as cysteine tandem protein (CSPα), is important for maintaining the normal function of nerve tissues, but its oncogenic function remains unknown. Here, we report a unique mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of DNAJC5. DNAJC5 protein expression is highly detectable in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and is strongly related to a poor prognosis among HCC patients. DNAJC5 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation and reduced the ratio of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, DNAJC5 interacts with SKP2 and enhances the degradation of p27 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor1B) by promoting formation of the SKP2-p27 complex. In contrast, DNAJC5 knockdown rescues the SKP2-mediated decrease in p27 protein levels. These results reveal that the DNAJC5-SKP2-p27 pathway is a novel mechanism for the oncogenic function of DNAJC5 in HCC.

Abstract: The effects of senescence on geriatric disorders are well explored, but how it influences infections in the elderly is poorly addressed. Here, we show that several anti-microbial responses are elevated in senescent epithelial cells and old mice, which results in decreased bacterial survival in the host after infection. We identify higher levels of iNOS as a crucial host response and show that p38 MAPK in senescent epithelial cells acts as a negative regulator of iNOS transcription. However, in older mice, the ability to impede bacterial infection does not result in enhanced survival, possibly because elevated pro-inflammatory responses are not countered by a robust host protective anti-inflammatory response. Overall, while addressing an alternate advantage of senescent cells, our study demonstrates that infection-associated morbidity in the elderly may not be the sole outcome of pathogen loads but may also be influenced by the host's ability to resolve inflammation-induced damage.

Abstract: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) enhanced TNF-α and TRAIL/Apo2L induced cell death in various human cancer cells derived from malignant glioma, melanoma, breast cancer and leukemia, although the effect was not detected with IL-6 alone. The effects of IL-6 using SKBR3 cells were associated with the generation of apoptotic cells as analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. IL-6 activated p53 and upregulated TRAIL death receptors (DR-4 and DR-5) and stimulated the TNF-α and TRAIL dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway without activation of the p53 mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway. TNF-α and TRAIL induced cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was more enhanced by IL-6, although these caspases were not cleaved by IL-6 alone. The dead cell generation elicited by the combination with IL-6 was blocked by anti-human TRAIL R2/TNFRSF10B Fc chimera antibody which can neutralize the DR-5 mediated death signal. These findings indicate that IL-6 could contribute to the enhancement of TNF-α or TRAIL induced apoptosis through p53 dependent upregulation of DR-4 and DR-5. The data suggest that a favorable therapeutic interaction could occur between TNF-α or TRAIL and IL-6, and provide an experimental basis for rational clinical treatments in various cancers.

Abstract: It has become amply clear that mitochondrial function defined by quality, quantity, dynamics, homeostasis, and regulated by mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis is a critical metric of human aging and disease. As a consequence, therapeutic interventions that can improve mitochondrial function can have a profound impact on human health and longevity. Kisspeptins are neuropeptides belonging to the family of metastasis suppressors that are known to regulate functions like fertility, reproduction, and metabolism. Using SKNSH cell line, hippocampus explant cultures and hippocampus of aging Wistar rat models, we show that Kisspeptin-10 (Kp) induces autophagy and mitophagy via calcium, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1) signaling pathway that is independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Intriguingly, Kp administration in vivo also results in the enhancement of mitochondrial number, complex I activity, and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) levels. This study uncovers potential effects of Kp in protecting mitochondrial health and as a possible therapeutic intervention to hippocampus associated impairments such as memory, cognitive aging, and other diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Ferroptosis is a necrotic form of cell death caused by inactivation of the glutathione system and uncontrolled iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. Increasing evidence implicates ferroptosis in a wide range of diseases from neurotrauma to cancer, highlighting the importance of identifying an executioner system that can be exploited for clinical applications. In this study, using pharmacological and genetic models of ferroptosis, we observed that lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic leakage of cathepsin B unleashes structural and functional changes in mitochondria and promotes a not previously reported cleavage of histone H3. Inhibition of cathepsin-B robustly rescued cellular membrane integrity and chromatin degradation. We show that these protective effects are independent of glutathione peroxidase-4 and are mediated by preventing lysosomal membrane damage. This was further confirmed when cathepsin B knockout primary fibroblasts remained unaffected in response to various ferroptosis inducers. Our work identifies new and yet-unrecognized aspects of ferroptosis and identifies cathepsin B as a mediator of ferroptotic cell death.

Expression of C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion leads to formation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins but does not influence autophagy or proteasomal function in neuronal cells,

Abstract: C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) is the major genetic cause underpinning frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FLTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). C9orf72 HRE-associated pathogenesis involves both loss-of-function, through reduced C9orf72 levels, and gain-of-function mechanisms, including formation of RNA foci and generation of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. In addition, dysfunctional protein degradation pathways, i.e. autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), are suggested. Our aim was to study the gain-of-function mechanisms in the context of the function of protein degradation pathways as well as the regulation of the DPR proteins through these pathways. To this end, we expressed the pathological HRE in neuronal N2a cells and mouse primary cortical neurons. Protein degradation pathways were modulated to induce or block autophagy or to inhibit UPS. In addition, proteasomal activity was assessed. The C9orf72 HRE-expressing N2a cells and neurons were confirmed to produce RNA foci and DPR proteins, predominantly the Poly-GP proteins. However, the presence of these pathological hallmarks did not result in alterations in autophagy or proteasomal activity in either of the studied cell types. In N2a cells, Poly-GP proteins appeared in soluble forms and Lactacystin-mediated UPS inhibition increased their levels, indicating proteasomal regulation. Similar effects were not observed in cortical neurons, where the Poly-GP proteins formed also higher molecular weight forms. These results suggest a cell type-specific morphology and regulation of the DPR proteins. Further studies in other model systems may shed additional light onto the effects of the C9orf72 HRE on cellular protein degradation pathways and the regulation of the DPR protein levels.

Abstract: Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is vital for vertebrate development and adult homeostasis. Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the lysosomal breakdown of glycogen. Our previous study showed that GAA was highly expressed in mouse pulmonary veins. While whether GAA was involved in angiogenesis remained largely unknown, thus, we performed knockdown experiments both in vivo and in vitro and endothelial cell function experiments to clarify this concern point. We identified that GAA expressed widely at different levels during zebrafish embryonic development and GAA morphants showed excessive angiogenesis of ISV at later stage. In GAA knockdown HUVECs, the migration and tube formation capacity were increased, resulted from the formation of large lamellipodia-like protrusions at the edge of cells. By analyzing autophagic flux, we found that autophagy disorder was the mechanism of GAA knockdown-induced excessive angiogenesis. The block of autophagic flux caused upregulation of Rac1, a small GTPase, and the latter promoted excessive sprouts in zebrafish and enhanced angiogenic behavior in HUVECs. In addition, overexpression of transcription factor E3, a master regulator of autophagy, rescued upregulation of RAC1 and enhanced angiogenic function in GAA-knockdown HUVECs. Also, inhibition of Rac1 partly restored enhanced angiogenic function in GAA-knockdown HUVECs. Taken together, our study firstly reported a novel function of GAA in angiogenesis which is mediated by upregulation of Rac1 induced by autophagy disorder.

Abstract: PGAM5 is a protein phosphatase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane through its transmembrane (TM) domain and is cleaved within the TM domain upon mitochondrial dysfunction. We found previously that cleaved PGAM5 is released from mitochondria, following proteasome-mediated rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane during mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy specific to mitochondria. Here, we examined the role of cleaved PGAM5 outside mitochondria. Deletion mutants that mimic cleaved PGAM5 existed not only in the cytosol but also in the nucleus, and a fraction of cleaved PGAM5 translocated to the nucleus during mitophagy induced by the uncoupler CCCP. We identified serine/arginine-related nuclear matrix protein of 160 kDa (SRm160)/SRRM1, which contains a highly phosphorylated domain rich in arginine/serine dipeptides, called the RS domain, as a nuclear protein that interacts with PGAM5. PGAM5 dephosphorylated SRm160, and incubation of lysates from WT cells, but not of those from PGAM5-deficient cells, induced dephosphorylation of SRm160 and another RS domain-containing protein SRSF1, one of the most characterized serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. Moreover, phosphorylation of these proteins and other SR proteins, which are commonly reactive toward the 1H4 monoclonal antibody that detects phosphorylated SR proteins, decreased during mitophagy, largely because of PGAM5 activity. These results suggest that PGAM5 regulates phosphorylation of these nuclear proteins during mitophagy. Because SRm160 and SR proteins play critical roles in mRNA metabolism, PGAM5 may coordinate cellular responses to mitochondrial stress at least in part through post-transcriptional and pre-translational events.

Abstract: Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disorder characterized by the loss of dystrophin expression, muscle necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Ongoing muscle regeneration is impaired by persistent cytokine stress, further decreasing muscle function. Patients with DMD rarely survive beyond their early 20s, with cardiac and respiratory dysfunction being the primary cause of death. Despite an increase in our understanding of disease progression as well as promising preclinical animal models for therapeutic intervention, treatment options for muscular dystrophy remain limited and novel therapeutic targets are required. Many reports suggest that the TGFβ signalling pathway is activated in dystrophic muscle and contributes to the pathology of DMD in part by impairing the differentiation of myoblasts into mature myofibers. Here, we show that in vitro knockdown of the Ste20-like kinase, SLK, can partially restore myoblast differentiation downstream of TGFβ in a Smad2/3 independent manner. In an mdx model, we demonstrate that SLK is expressed at high levels in regenerating myofibers. Muscle-specific deletion of SLK reduced leukocyte infiltration, increased myogenin and utrophin expression and enhanced differentiation. This was accompanied by resistance to eccentric contraction-induced injury in slow fiber type-enriched soleus muscles. Finally, we found that these effects were partially dependent on the upregulation of p38 signalling. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SLK downregulation can restore some aspects of disease progression in DMD.

Abstract: Metformin has been suggested as an anti-cancer agent. However, increasing reports show that some tumors are resistant to metformin. Identification of factors affecting metformin mediated cancer therapy is of great significance. FGFR1 is a receptor-tyrosine-kinase that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, which is associated with poor-prognosis. To investigate the effect of FGFR1 overexpression on metformin-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that FGFR1 overexpression rendered MCF-7 and T47D cells resistant to metformin. In particular, we found that, in addition to AKT and ERK1/2 activation, FGFR1-induced activation of IRS1 and IGF1R, key regulators connecting metabolism and cancer, was associated with metformin resistance. Targeting IRS with IRS1 KO or IRS inhibitor NT157 significantly sensitized FGFR1 overexpressing cells to metformin. Combination of NT157 with metformin induced enhanced inhibition of p-IGF1R, p-ERK1/2 and p-mTOR. Moreover, we demonstrated that IRS1 functions as a critical mediator of the crosstalk between FGFR1 and IGF1R pathways, which involves a feedback loop between IRS1 and MAPK/ERK. Our study highlights the significance of FGFR1 status and IRS1 activation in metformin-resistance, which will facilitate the development of strategies targeting FGFR overexpression-associated metformin resistance.

Abstract: The zebrafish retina expresses four recoverin genes (rcv1a, rcv1b, rcv2a and rcv2b) and four opsin kinase genes (grk1a, grk1b, grk7a and grk7b) coding for recoverin and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (opsin kinase) paralogs, respectively. Both protein groups are suggested to form regulatory complexes in rod and cone outer segments, but at present, we lack information about co-localization of recoverin and opsin kinases in zebrafish retinae and which protein-protein interacting pairs form. We analyzed the distribution and co-localization of recoverin and opsin kinase expression in the zebrafish retina. For this purpose, we used custom-tailored monospecific antibodies revealing that the amount of recoverin paralogs in a zebrafish retina can differ by more than one order of magnitude with the highest amount for recoverin 1a and 2b. Further, immunohistochemical labelling showed presence of recoverin 1a in all rod cell compartments, but it only co-localized with opsin kinase 1a in rod outer segments. In contrast, recoverin 2b was only detected in double cones and co-localized with opsin kinases 1b, 7a and 7b. Further, we investigated the interaction between recoverin and opsin kinase variants by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy indicating interaction of recoverin 1a and recoverin 2b with all opsin kinases. However, binding kinetics for recoverin 1a differed from those observed with recoverin 2b that showed slower association and dissociation processes. Our results indicate diverse recoverin and opsin kinase properties due to differential expression and interaction profiles.

Abstract: Recently, oxidative stress is a common denominator in the pathogenesis of metal-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, antioxidant therapy is considered as a promising strategy for treating lead-related cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that astragaloside IV (AS-IV) ameliorates lead-associated cognitive deficits through Nrf2-dependent antioxidant mechanisms. Male Nrf2-KO and WT mice received drinking water with 2000 ppm lead and/or AS-IV by gavage for 8 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age. Morris water maze test and biochemical assays were employed to study cognition-enhancing and antioxidant effects of AS-IV. The signaling pathways involved were analyzed using RT-PCR and western blot technology. Significantly, AS-IV attenuated Morris water maze-based cognitive impairment in lead-intoxicated mice. Importantly, cognition-enhancing effect of AS-IV was lost in Nrf2-KO mice. In parallel, AS-IV suppressed lead acetate (PbAc)-induced oxidative stress, as measured by MDA. Mechanistically, AS-IV can up-regulate the expressions of the GCLc and HO-1 at the level of transcription and translation, but not SOD, TrxR activity, GCLm, Trx1, and NQO1 expression. Interestingly, AS-IV induced accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus, whereas Nrf2 mRNA levels were unchanged. Furthermore, AS-IV treatment resulted in elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (active form) and phosphorylated GSK-3β (inactive forms) but decreased level of phosphorylated Fyn. Collectively, our findings indicate that AS-IV may target Nrf2 to attenuate lead-triggered oxidative stress and subsequent cognitive impairments, suggesting that AS-IV is a potential candidate for the treatment of lead-associated cognitive diseases.

Abstract: Error-free progression through mitosis is critical for proper cell division and accurate distribution of the genetic material. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase regulates the progression from metaphase to anaphase and its activation is controlled by the cofactors Cdc20 and Cdh1. Additionally, genome stability is maintained by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which monitors proper attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules prior to cell division. We had shown a role for Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) in microtubule dynamics and mitosis and here we describe a novel role of TBK1 in regulating SAC in breast and lung cancer cells. TBK1 interacts with and phosphorylates Cdc20 and Cdh1 and depletion of TBK1 elevates SAC components. TBK1 inhibition increases the association of Cdc20 with APC/C and BubR1 indicating inactivation of APC/C; similarly, interaction of Cdh1 with APC/C is also enhanced. TBK1 and TTK inhibition reduces cell viability and enhances centrosome amplification and micronucleation. These results indicate that alterations in TBK1 will impede mitotic progression and combining TBK1 inhibitors with other regulators of mitosis might be effective in eliminating cancer cells.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can initiate autophagy via unfolded protein response (UPR). As a key downstream gene of UPR, DDIT3/CHOP is expressed in chondrocytes. However, the regulation mechanism of DDIT3/CHOP on autophagy in chondrocytes remains unclear. In this study, the expression levels of autophagic markers Beclin1 and LC3B were found to decrease while p62 increase in the tibial growth plate and costal primary chondrocytes from DDIT3/CHOP KO mice. In vitro, overexpressing DDIT3/CHOP induced autophagy in ATDC5 chondrocytes, displaying an elevated immunofluorescence signal of LC3B and elevated numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Analysis of the gain- and loss-of-function indicated that the protein level of Beclin1 and the ratio of LC3BII/I increased in DDIT3/CHOP overexpression cells, whereas decreased in DDIT3/CHOP knockdown cells. The decreased level of p62 and additional accumulation of LC3BII caused by chloroquine (CQ) further indicated that DDIT3/CHOP enhanced autophagic flux. Mechanistically, we found that DDIT3/CHOP binds directly to the promoter of SIRT1 to promote its expression by CHIP, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. In addition, SIRT1 enhanced autophagic activity in ATDC5 cells, and inhibition or activation of SIRT1 partially reversed the effect of overexpressing or downregulating DDIT3/CHOP on autophagy. Furthermore, AKT signaling was found to be responsible for DDIT3/CHOP-regulated autophagy in ATDC5 cells. SIRT1 knockdown reversed the effect of DDIT3/CHOP overexpression on AKT signaling. In conclusion, our data clarifies that DDIT3/CHOP promotes autophagy in ATDC5 chondrocytes through the SIRT1-AKT pathway. These results were also confirmed in the primary chondrocytes.

Abstract: TDP-43 protein is found deposited as inclusions in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient's brain. The mechanism of neuron death in ALS is not fully deciphered but several TDP-43 toxicity mechanisms such as mis-regulation of autophagy, mitochondrial impairment and generation of oxidative stress etc., have been implicated. A predominantly nuclear protein, Cyclin C, can regulate the oxidative stress response via transcription of stress response genes and also by translocation to the cytoplasm for the activation of mitochondrial fragmentation-dependent cell death pathway. Using the well-established yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model, we examined here whether upon TDP-43 aggregation, cell survival depends on the CNC1 gene that encodes the Cyclin C protein or other genes which encode proteins that function in conjunction with Cyclin C, such as DNM1, FIS1 and MED13. We show that the TDP-43's toxicity is significantly reduced in yeast deleted for CNC1 or DNM1 genes and remains unaltered by deletions of genes, FIS1 and MED13. Importantly, this rescue is observed only in presence of functional mitochondria. Also, deletion of the YBH3 gene involved in the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway reduced the TDP-43 toxicity. Deletion of the VPS1 gene involved in the peroxisomal fission pathway did not mitigate the TDP-43 toxicity. Strikingly, Cyclin C-YFP was observed to relocate to the cytoplasm in response to TDP-43's co-expression which was prevented by addition of an anti-oxidant molecule, N-acetyl cysteine. Overall, the Cyclin C, Dnm1 and Ybh3 proteins are found to be important players in the TDP-43-induced oxidative stress-mediated cell death in the S. cerevisiae model.

Abstract: Chronic exposure to magnetic fields (MFs) has a diverse range of effects on biological systems but definitive molecular mechanisms of the interaction remain largely unknown. One of the most frequently reported effects of MF exposure is an elevated concentration of intracellular Ca2+ through disputed pathways. Other prominent effects include increased oxidative stress and upregulation of neural markers through EGFR activation in stem cells. Further characterization of cascades triggered by MF exposure is hindered by the phenotype diversity of biological models used in the literature. In an attempt to reveal more mechanistic data in this field, we combined the most commonly used biological model and MF parameters with the most commonly reported effects of MFs. Based on clues from the pathways previously defined as sensitive to MFs (EGFR and Zn2+-binding enzymes), the roles of different types of channels (voltage gated Ca2+ channels, NMDA receptors, TRP channels) were inquired in the effects of 50 Hz MFs on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. We report that, an influx of Zn2+ accompanies MF-induced Ca2+ intake, which is only attenuated by the broad-range inhibitor of TRP channels and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) among other blockers (memantine, nifedipine, ethosuximide and gabapentin). Interestingly, cation influx completely disappears when intracellular Zn2+ is chelated. Our results rule out voltage gated Ca2+ channels as a gateway to MF-induced Ca2+ intake and suggest Zn2+-related channels as a new focus in the field.

Abstract: Inside cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms the largest Ca2+ store. Ca2+ is actively pumped by the SERCA pumps in the ER, where intraluminal Ca2+-binding proteins enable the accumulation of large amount of Ca2+. IP3 receptors and the ryanodine receptors mediate the release of Ca2+ in a controlled way, thereby evoking complex spatio-temporal signals in the cell. The steady state Ca2+ concentration in the ER of about 500 μM results from the balance between SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake and the passive leakage of Ca2+. The passive Ca2+ leak from the ER is often ignored, but can play an important physiological role, depending on the cellular context. Moreover, excessive Ca2+ leakage significantly lowers the amount of Ca2+ stored in the ER compared to normal conditions, thereby limiting the possibility to evoke Ca2+ signals and/or causing ER stress, leading to pathological consequences. The so-called Ca2+-leak channels responsible for Ca2+ leakage from the ER are however still not well understood, despite over 20 different proteins have been proposed to contribute to it. This review has the aim to critically evaluate the available evidence about the various channels potentially involved and to draw conclusions about their relative importance.

Abstract: Retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation and inhibits the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. α-Actinin-4 is a member of the α-actinin family, which exhibits unique mechanosensory regulation. Herein, we elucidated the effects of RA on α-actinin-4 expression during cell differentiation. RA increased the levels of α-actinin-4 protein significantly, while mRNA expression remained unchanged. In addition, RA treatment altered the intracellular localization of α-actinin-4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Cells pretreated with RA, maintained α-actinin-4 protein levels after cycloheximide treatment as compared with control cells. The amount of ubiquitylated α-actinin-4 protein in RA-treated cells was less than in control cells. These results indicate that RA may inhibit nuclei transport and proteasomal degradation of α-actinin-4 protein. α-Actinin-4 may play a significant role in RA-induced differentiation, including the promotion of cytomorphology changes.

Abstract: Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex mediates the transition from the G1 to S phase in mammalian somatic cells. Meiotic oocytes pass through the G2/M transition and complete the first meiosis to reach maturation at the metaphase of meiosis II without intervening S phase, while Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex is found to express during meiotic progression. Whether Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex regulates meiotic cell cycle progression is not known. Here, we found its different role in oocyte meiosis: Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex served as a regulator of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent aneuploidy in meiosis I. Inhibition of CDK4/6 kinases disrupted spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and kinetochore-microtubule attachments, but unexpectedly accelerated meiotic progression by inactivating SAC, consequently resulting in production of aneuploid oocytes. Further studies showed that the MPF activity decrease before first polar body extrusion was accelerated probably by inactivation of the SAC to promote ubiquitin-mediated cyclin B1 degradation. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role of Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex in mediating control of the SAC in female meiosis I.

Abstract: Hyperthermia is a promising anticancer treatment used in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Temperatures above 41.5 °C are cytotoxic and hyperthermia treatments can target a localized area of the body that has been invaded by a tumor. However, non-lethal temperatures (39–41 °C) can increase cellular defenses, such as heat shock proteins. This adaptive survival response, thermotolerance, can protect cells against subsequent cytotoxic stress such as anticancer treatments and heat shock (>41.5 °C). Autophagy is another survival process that is activated by stress. This study aims to determine whether autophagy can be activated by heat shock at 42 °C, and if this response is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Autophagy was increased during shorter heating times (<60 min) at 42 °C in cells. Levels of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) and autophagy proteins Beclin-1, LC3-II/LC-3I, Atg7 and Atg12-Atg5 were increased. Heat shock at 42 °C increased levels of ROS. Increased levels of LC3 and AVOs at 42 °C were inhibited by antioxidants. Therefore, increased autophagy during heat shock at 42 °C (<60 min) was mediated by ROS. Conversely, heat shock at 42 °C for longer times (1−3 h) caused apoptosis and activation of caspases in the mitochondrial, death receptor and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways. Thermotolerant cells, which were developed at 40 °C, were resistant to activation of apoptosis at 42 °C. Autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin sensitized cells to activation of apoptosis by heat shock (42 °C). Improved understanding of autophagy in cellular responses to heat shock could be useful for optimizing the efficacy of hyperthermia in the clinic.

Abstract: Nur77 (NGFI-B) is a nuclear receptor that belongs to the Nr4a family of orphan nuclear receptors (Nr4a1). This transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of multiple functions, such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism, and brain function. However, the mechanisms involved in its different regulatory properties remain unclear. In search for regulatory mechanisms of Nur77 function, we identified that Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT gamma (PIASγ), an E3 SUMO-protein ligase, potently repressed Nur77 transcriptional activity in HEK-293T cells. This PIASγ activity was sensitive to Sentrin SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1). Substitution of two putative phylogenetically well-conserved small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) acceptor sites, lysine 102 (K102) and 577 (K577) by arginine residues (R) modulated Nur77 transcriptional activity. In particular, Nur77-K102R and Nur77-K102R/K577R mutants strongly decreased the transcriptional activity of Nur77, whereas single K577R substitution increased transcriptional activity of Nur77. Repression of Nur77 transcriptional activity by SUMO2 and PIASγ was reduced by the K577R mutation, whereas the K102R mutant remained insensitive to SUMO2. Interestingly, the roles of these SUMO acceptor sites in Nur77 are distinct from previously observed activities on its close homolog Nurr1. Thus, the present study identified SUMO2 and PIASγ as important transcriptional co-regulators of Nur77.

Abstract: The human Anterior GRadient 2 (AGR2) protein is an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein which belongs to the Protein-Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) superfamily and is involved to productive protein folding in the ER. As such AGR2, often found overexpressed in adenocarcinomas, contributes to tumour development by enhancing ER proteostasis. We previously demonstrated that AGR2 is secreted (extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2)) in the tumour microenvironment and plays extracellular roles independent of its ER functions. Herein, we show that eAGR2 triggers cell proliferation and characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that eAGR2 enhances tumour cell growth by repressing the tumour suppressor p21CIP1. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism through which eAGR2 behaves as a growth factor in the tumour microenvironment, independently of its ER function, thus promoting tumour cell growth through repression of p21CIP1. Our results provide a rationale for targeting eAGR2/p21CIP1-based signalling as a potential therapeutic target to impede tumour growth.

Abstract: Previously, we showed that Rab5a and Rab5b differentially regulate fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis in Leishmania, respectively. To unequivocally demonstrate the role of Rab5b in hemoglobin endocytosis in Leishmania, we generated null-mutants of Rab5b parasites by sequentially replacing both copies of LdRab5b with the hygromycin and neomycin resistance gene cassettes. LdRab5b−/− null-mutant parasite was confirmed by qPCR analysis of genomic DNA using LdRab5b specific primers. LdRab5b−/− cells showed severe growth defect indicating essential function of LdRab5b in parasite. To characterize the role of Rab5b in Hb endocytosis in parasites, LdRab5b−/− cells were rescued by exogenous addition of hemin in growth medium. Our results showed that LdRab5b−/− cells are relatively smaller in size. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of relatively enlarged flagellar pocket and bigger intracellular vesicles in these cells in comparison to control cells. Both promastigotes and amastigotes of Rab5b null-mutant parasites were unable to internalize Hb but fluid phase endocytosis of different markers was not affected. However, complementation of LdRab5b:WT in LdRab5b−/− cells (LdRab5b−/−:pRab5b:WT) rescued Hb internalization in these cells. Interestingly, LdRab5b−/− cells showed significantly less Hb-receptor on cell surface in comparison to control cells indicating a block in HbR trafficking. Finally, we showed that LdRab5b−/− parasites can infect the macrophages but are unable to survive after 96 h of infection in comparison to control cells. However, supplementation of hemin in the growth medium significantly rescued LdRab5b−/− Leishmania survival in macrophage indicating that LdRab5b function is essential for the acquisition of heme from internalized Hb for the survival of Leishmania.

Abstract: GSK3β, a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr kinase, regulates cell metabolism, proliferation and differentiation. Its activity is spatially and temporally regulated dependent on external stimuli and interacting partners, and its deregulation is associated with various human disorders. In this study, we identify C3G (RapGEF1), a protein essential for mammalian embryonic development as an interacting partner and substrate of GSK3β. In vivo and in vitro interaction assays demonstrated that GSK3β and Akt are present in complex with C3G. Molecular modelling and mutational analysis identified a domain in C3G that aids interaction with GSK3β, and overlaps with its nuclear export sequence. GSK3β phosphorylates C3G on primed as well as unprimed sites, and regulates its subcellular localization. Over-expression of C3G resulted in activation of Akt and inactivation of GSK3β. Huntingtin aggregate formation, dependent on GSK3β inhibition, was enhanced upon C3G overexpression. Stable clones of C2C12 cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of C3G, that cannot differentiate, show reduced Akt activity and S9-GSK3β phosphorylation compared to wild type cells. Co-expression of catalytically active GSK3β inhibited C3G induced myocyte differentiation. C3G mutant defective for GSK3β phosphorylation, does not alter S9-GSK3β phosphorylation and, is compromised for inducing myocyte differentiation. Our results show complex formation and reciprocal regulation between GSK3β and C3G. We have identified a novel function of C3G as a negative regulator of GSK3β, a property important for its ability to induce myogenic differentiation.

Abstract: The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is responsible for the folding and post-translational modification of secretory proteins, as well as for triaging misfolded proteins. During folding, there is a complex yet only partially understood interplay between disulfide bond formation, which is an enzyme catalyzed event in the oxidizing environment of the ER, along with other post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chaperone-supported protein folding. Here, we used the glycoprotein torsinA as a model substrate to explore the impact of ER redox homeostasis on PTMs and protein biogenesis. TorsinA is a AAA+ ATPase with unusual oligomeric properties and controversial functions. The deletion of a C-terminal glutamic acid residue (∆E) is associated with the development of Early-Onset Torsion Dystonia, a severe movement disorder. TorsinA differs from other AAA+ ATPases since it is an ER resident, and as a result of its entry into the ER torsinA contains two N-linked glycans and at least one disulfide bond. The role of these PTMs on torsinA biogenesis and function and the identity of the enzymes that catalyze them are poorly defined. Using a yeast torsinA expression system, we demonstrate that a specific protein disulfide isomerase, Pdi1, affects the folding and N-linked glycosylation of torsinA and torsinA∆E in a redox-dependent manner, suggesting that the acquisition of early torsinA folding intermediates is sensitive to perturbed interactions between Cys residues and the quality control machinery. We also highlight the role of specific Cys residues during torsinA biogenesis and demonstrate that torsinA∆E is more sensitive than torsinA when these Cys residues are mutated.

Abstract: We have studied the interaction of a VegT mRNA localization signal sequence with the membranes of the mitochondrial cloud in Xenopus oocytes, and the binding of the VegT mRNA signal sequence to the lipid raft regions of the vesicles bounded by ordered and disordered phospholipid bilayers. RNA preference for the membranes of the mitochondrial cloud was confirmed using microscopy of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer from RNA molecules to membranes. Our studies show that VegT mRNA has a higher affinity for ordered regions of lipid bilayers. This conclusion is supported by the dissociation constant measurements for RNA-liposome complex and the visualization of the FRET signal between giant vesicles and RNA. Our data indicate that these affinities are sensitive and distinct to the location of the localization elements within the VegT mRNA localization signal structure. Therefore, specific binding of VegT mRNA localization signal sequence to membranes can be responsible for polarized distribution of VegT mRNA in Xenopus oocytes. We suggest that the mechanism of this binding can involve the interaction of the localization elements within the VegT mRNA signal sequence with lipid raft regions of the mitochondrial cloud membranes, thereby utilizing localization elements as novel lipid raft-binding RNA motifs.

Abstract: Calcium is a second messenger essential, in all cells, for most cell functions. The spatio-temporal control of changes in intracellular calcium concentration is partly due to the activation of calcium channels. Voltage-operated calcium channels are present in excitable and non-excitable cells. If the mechanism of voltage-operated calcium channels is well known in excitable cells the Ca2+ toolkit used in non-excitable cells to activate the calcium channels is less described. Herein we discuss about very similar pathways involving voltage activated Cav1 channels in two unrelated non-excitable cells; ectoderm cells undergoing neural development and effector Th2 lymphocytes responsible for parasite elimination and also allergic diseases. We will examine the way by which these channels operate and are regulated, as well as the consequences in terms of gene transcription. Finally, we will consider the questions that remain unsolved and how they might be a challenge for the future.

Abstract: Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive form of androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC), correlated with therapeutic resistance. Interleukin (IL)-6 promotes proliferation and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of androgen dependent LNCaP cells. We treated LNCaP cells with IL-6 and observed for in vitro NED of cells and also expression of NE markers βIII tubulin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (ChA). Here we investigated the proteins and/or pathways involved in NED of LNCaP cells induced by IL-6 and characterized their role in NED of PCa cells. We found that the altered proteins modulated AMPK signaling pathway in NE cells. Remarkably, IL-6 induces NED of LNCaP cells through activation of AMPK and SIRT1 and also both of these are co-regulated while playing a predominant role in NED of LNCaP cells. Of the few requirements of AMPK-SIRT1 activation, increased eNOS is essential for NED by elevating Nitric oxide (NO) levels. Pleiotropic effects of NO ultimately regulate p38MAPK in IL-6 induced NED. Hence, IL-6 induced AMPK-SIRT1 activation eventually transfers its activation signals through p38MAPK for advancing NED of LNCaP cells. Moreover, inactivation of p38MAPK with specific inhibitor (SB203580) attenuated IL-6 induced NED of LNCaP cells. Therefore, IL-6 promotes NED of PCa cells via AMPK/SIRT1/p38MAPK signaling. Finally, targeting AMPK-SIRT1 or p38MAPK in androgen independent PC3 cells with neuroendocrine features reversed their neuroendocrine characteristics. Taken together these novel findings reveal that targeting p38MAPK mitigated NED of PCa cells, and thus it can be a favorable target to overcome progression of NEPC.

Abstract: The Salt-inducible kinase (SIKs) belongs to an AMPK-related family kinase, an isoform of the SIK family, SIK1 gets frequently downregulated in various types of cancer contribute to tumorigenesis. However, its precise role in breast cancer and the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear. Herein, analysis of the clinical data reveals that SIK1 expression was significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues, and closely associated with poor survival rate in breast cancer. SIK1 is functionally stimulating oxidative phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, SIK1 directly interacted with p53 and positively regulates its transcriptional activity, thereby facilitates oxidative phosphorylation in breast cancer cells. The knockdown of SIK1 downregulates p53 transcriptional activity, leading to stimulation of aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation. Moreover, high expression of SIK3 stimulates mTOR-mediated aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation of breast cancer cells. These findings suggest that SIK isoforms plays distinct role in aerobic glycolysis and cell growth of breast cancer, attenuated SIK1/p53 signaling suppresses oxidative phosphorylation and growth inhibitory effect in breast cancer cells, while enhanced SIK3/mTOR signaling potentiates aerobic glycolysis mediated cell growth in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Biosensors utilizing intact live cells can report responses to certain stimuli rapidly and sensitively and have attracted a great deal of attention. The expression pattern of HSPA6, a little studied HSPA family member, has contributed to the development of multifunctional and intelligent whole-cell sensors. Herein, a new pHSPA6-based EGFP fluorescent reporter cell line was designed and developed via a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in strategy. The fluorescent reporter cell line has a precise EGFP integration site and gene copy number, and no selectable marker genes were introduced during the selection processes. Stimulation experiments with HSPA6-specific stressors indicated that EGFP fluorescent reporter cells could rapidly and effectively convert stress signals into EGFP fluorescent signals. Furthermore, cell proliferation and gene expression pattern analysis showed that the fluorescent reporter cells grew well and that both the integrated EGFP gene and the pHSPA6 gene were expressed rapidly and sensitively in response to stimulation. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of a cell model for HSPA6 expression/interaction and an intelligent live cell sensor, which can potentially be applied to numerous fields, such as those focusing on cellular models of HSPA6 signaling cascades, biomaterials, food security, environmental assessment, and drug screening.

Abstract: In this study, we developed a method to analyze liposomal binding to a cell membrane receptor using fluorescence-labeled liposomes and demonstrated that scavenger class B type 1 (SR-B1) plays a crucial role in binding of liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) to HEK293T cell membrane and phosphatidic acid (PA) can modulate it. Site-directed mutagenesis of SR-B1 revealed that S112F and T175A mutations in its ectodomain abrogated binding and endocytosis of PC liposomes in HEK293T cells. K151A and K156A mutations attenuated their binding and endocytosis too. Although the effects of mutations on binding and endocytosis were similar between PC liposomes and PC/PA and PA liposomes, SR-B1 dependency appeared to be PC > PC/PA > PA liposomes. Our data indicate that (i) nanoparticles including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), silica, and liposomes bind to a common or close site of SR-B1, and (ii) PC/PA and PA liposomes bind not only to SR-B1 but also other receptor(s) in HEK293T cells. In addition, PC/PA liposomes induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in HEK293T cells more than PC liposomes. Treatment of HEK293T cells with SR-B1 siRNA suppressed PC/PA liposome-induced LD formation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SR-B1 plays an essential role in binding PC-containing liposomes and the subsequent induction of cellular responses, while PA can modulate them.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial cells are subject to mechanical stress resulting from blood flow and interactions with leukocytes. Stress occurs at the apical, vessel-facing cell surface and leads to membrane ruptures that have to be resealed to ensure cell survival. To mimic this process, we developed a laser ablation protocol selectively inducing wounds in the apical plasma membrane of endothelial cells. We show that Ca2+-dependent membrane resealing is initiated following this wounding protocol and that the process is accompanied by substantial membrane lipid dynamics at the wound site. Specifically, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid rapidly accumulate at membrane wounds forming potential interaction platforms for Ca2+/phospholipid binding proteins of the annexin (Anx) family that are also recruited within seconds after wounding. Depletion of one annexin, AnxA2, and its putative binding partner S100A11 interferes with membrane resealing suggesting that Ca2+-dependent annexin-phospholipid interactions are required for efficient membrane wound repair in endothelial cells.

Abstract: The keystone pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) elicits inflammation and autophagy in periodontal tissues. Transcription factor CXXC-type zinc finger protein 5 (CXXC5) and various signals are sensitive to P. gingivalis invasion. Herein, we investigated the P. gingivalis-elicited autophagy activity, the contribution of CXXC5, and the involvement of signals in cementoblasts, tooth root surface cells crucial in periodontal and periapical regions. After coculture with P. gingivalis, cementoblasts exhibited inflammatory cytokine increase, light chain 3(LC3)-I/II conversion, autophagosome activation, and CXXC5 reduction. Cementoblasts with loss and gain of CXXC5 were developed. CXXC5 silencing suppressed autophagy and inflammation, thereby partially compensating for the effects of P. gingivalis, and vice versa. We then screened potential signals and verified the positive participation of Stat3/Akt/Erk networks through specific inhibitor employment. P. gingivalis and CXXC5 induced autophagy through Beclin1 and Atg5 activation. Intriguingly, Annexin V/PI assay and EdU detection revealed that P. gingivalis promoted apoptosis and repressed cell proliferation. In sum, coculture with P. gingivalis enhanced autophagy activity in cementoblasts, which was partially suppressed by CXXC5 downregulation and mediated by Jak/Stat3, PI3K-Akt, and Erk1/2 signaling. This process probably influenced cell apoptosis and proliferation.

Abstract: MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1) is a mammalian 8-oxodGTPase for sanitizing oxidative damage to the nucleotide pool. Nudix type 5 (NUDT5) also sanitizes 8-oxodGDP in the nucleotide pool. The role of MTH1 and NUDT5 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression and metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, we reported that MTH1 and NUDT5 were upregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tissues, and higher levels of MTH1 or NUDT5 were associated with tumor metastasis and a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Their suppression also restrained tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo and significantly inhibited NSCLC cell migration, invasion, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression while promoting apoptosis in vitro. The opposite effects were observed in vitro following MTH1 or NUDT5 rescue. In addition, the upregulation of MTH1 or NUDT5 enhanced the MAPK pathway and PI3K/AKT activity. Furthermore, MTH1 and NUDT5 induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the essential role of MTH1 and NUDT5 in NSCLC tumor tumorigenesis and metastasis as well as their functions as valuable markers of the NSCLC prognosis and potential therapeutic targets.

Long noncoding RNA CCDC26 as a modulator of transcriptional switching between fetal and embryonic globins,

Abstract: The CCDC26 gene is considered to encode a functional noncoding RNA associated with acute myeloid leukemia and other cancers. However, investigations into the physiological roles of CCDC26 are rare. Previously, we reported that CCDC26 regulated proliferation and cell death of leukemia cells through KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, by using K562 leukemia cells and their derivative CCDC26-knockdown (KD) cells. Here we propose a new role of CCDC26 in the differentiation of erythroid cells. We showed that expression of embryonic (ε- and ζ-) globins was markedly upregulated in CCDC26-KD cells compared with K562 control cells during hemin-induced differentiation. In contrast, expression of fetal-type γ-globin, a major globin expressed in original K562 cells, was decreased. These changes in the expression of globin genes mainly took place at the transcriptional level, with significant suppression of transcription of adult (β-, δ-) globins in CCDC26-KD cells. Re-introduction of exogenous CCDC26 into the CCDC26-KD cells recovered low-level expression of the embryonal globins. These results suggest CCDC26 has a role in switching transcription of globin genes in the differentiation of erythroid cells. The expression profile of the CCDC26-KD cells and control cells suggests FOG-2, a transcriptional modulator, as a candidate for a mediator of the CCDC26-associated regulation. We showed that both embryonic globins were transcriptionally activated in FOG-2-KD K562 cells. The KIT inhibitor ISCK03 suppressed the production of hemoglobin in K562 cells but did not affect transcription of globin genes. To summarize, FOG-2, but not KIT, is responsible for globin transcriptional regulation by CCDC26.

Abstract: Nucleoli are sites where both the large and small ribosomal subunits mature. Biochemical assays have suggested that a multivalent nucleolar protein, NPM1/nucleophosmin contributes to the formation of the outer layer of the nucleolus. Prior works show that NPM1 depletion disorganizes the nucleolar structure. However, the mechanism of how NPM1 regulates the nucleolar structure has been unknown. We demonstrated that NPM1 directly interacts with the large ribosomal subunits and maintains them in the nucleolus. Ectopically localized NPM1 efficiently recruits only the large ribosomal subunit precursors, while ectopically localized large ribosomal subunit by the ribosomal protein RPL4 efficiently recruits NPM1. These results suggest that the nucleolar localization of NPM1 and the large ribosomal subunit precursors are mutually dependent. Furthermore, proteomic and localization analyses suggest that NPM1 plays a crucial role in the accumulation of the late processing machinery of the large ribosomal subunits in the nucleolus. Our results suggest that NPM1 maintains the pre-ribosomes and assembly machinery in the nucleolus, which in turn determines the nucleolar volume.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and therefore the discovery of novel therapeutic targets is crucial. P21-activated kinase (PAK1) is an important oncogene involved in the signaling of actin cytoskeleton organization. Although PAK1 inhibition has been shown to suppress cancer progression, specific PAK1 inhibitors are not available due to the complex structure and insufficient understanding of this kinase. The Hippo signaling effector TAZ is known to be elevated in multiple human cancers and to promote cancer metastasis. This study aimed to explore the role of TAZ in regulating the tumor suppressor ankyrin repeat domain 52 (ANKRD52) and PAK1 activity. A negative correlation between TAZ and ANKRD52 was observed, with knockdown of TAZ leading to enhanced ANKRD52 promoter activity and increased mRNA levels. Moreover, reduced ANKRD52 levels were associated with late-stage lung cancer. Knockdowns of ANKRD52 resulted in elevated cell mobility, while forced ANKRD52 expression attenuated cell mobility. ANKRD52 is a subunit of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) holoenzyme. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the interaction between PAK1 and the ANKRD52-PP6 complex. Knockdown of ANKRD52 or PP6c resulted in upregulated PAK1 phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates that the novel tumor suppressor protein ANKRD52 is transcriptionally inhibited by TAZ, regulating cell mobility through interactions with PP6c and dephosphorylation of PAK1.

Abstract: An essential requirement for cells to sustain a high proliferating rate is to be paired with enhanced protein synthesis through the production of ribosomes. For this reason, part of the growth-factor signaling pathways, are devoted to activate ribosome biogenesis. Enhanced production of ribosomes is a hallmark in cancer cells, which is boosted by different mechanisms. Here we report that the nucleolar tumor-protein MageB2, whose expression is associated with cell proliferation, also participates in ribosome biogenesis. Studies carried out in both siRNA-mediated MageB2 silenced cells and CRISPR/CAS9-mediated MageB2 knockout (KO) cells showed that its expression is linked to rRNA transcription increase independently of the cell proliferation status. Mechanistically, MageB2 interacts with phospho-UBF, a protein which causes the recruitment of RNA Pol I pre-initiation complex required for rRNA transcription. In addition, cells expressing MageB2 displays enhanced phospho-UBF occupancy at the rDNA gene promoter. Proteomic studies performed in MageB2 KO cells revealed impairment in ribosomal protein (RPs) content. Functionally, enhancement in rRNA production in MageB2 expressing cells, was directly associated with an increased dynamic in protein synthesis. Altogether our results unveil a novel function for a tumor-expressed protein from the MAGE-I family. Findings reported here suggest that nucleolar MageB2 might play a role in enhancing ribosome biogenesis as part of its repertoire to support cancer cell proliferation.

Abstract: Brain tumors comprise a large series of tumor cancer from benign to highly malignant gliomas and metastases from primary tumors outside the brain. Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is involved in a large series of cell functions including cell proliferation, migration, and cell death. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), the most important Ca2+ entry pathway in non-excitable cells, is involved in cell proliferation and migration and enhanced in tumor cells from breast cancer, colon cancer and cell lines derived from glioblastoma but there are almost no studies in human primary glioblastoma cells or other brain tumors. We have developed a single procedure to obtain primary cells from a large series (n = 49) of human brain tumors including schwannomas, meningiomas, oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, glioblastomas and brain metastases from ovary, breast and lung. Cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and subjected to Ca2+ imaging to investigate resting intracellular Ca2+ levels, Ca2+ responses to physiological agonists as well as voltage-operated Ca2+ entry and SOCE. We found significant differences in resting intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ responses to plasma membrane depolarization and ATP among the different tumor cells. Only malignant tumor cells, displayed Ca2+ responses to ATP. SOCE is significantly increased in malignant gliomas whereas voltage-gated Ca2+ entry is decreased. In addition, SOCE is significantly larger in high grade gliomas than in low grade gliomas suggesting that SOCE increases with glioma progression. These data may provide new insights on the role of intracellular Ca2+ and purinergic signalling in brain tumors.

Abstract: UBXN7 is a cofactor protein that provides a scaffold for both CRL3KEAP1 and CRL2VHL ubiquitin ligase complexes involved in the regulation of the NRF2 and HIF-1α protein levels respectively. NRF2 and HIF-1α are surveillance transcription factors that orchestrate the cellular response to oxidative stress (NRF2) or to hypoxia (HIF-1α). Since mitochondria are the main oxygen sensors as well as the principal producers of ROS, it can be presumed that they may be able to modulate the activity of CRL3KEAP1 and CRL2VHL complexes in response to stress. We have uncovered a new mechanism of such regulation that involves the UBXN7 cofactor protein and its regulation by mitochondrial MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. High level of UBXN7 leads to HIF-1α accumulation, whereas low level of UBXN7 correlates with an increase in NRF2 protein. The reciprocal regulation of HIF-1α and NRF2 by UBXN7 is coordinated under conditions of oxidative stress or hypoxia. In addition, this molecular mechanism leads to different metabolic states; high level of UBXN7 and accumulation of HIF-1α support glycolysis, whereas inactivation of UBXN7 and activation of NRF2 confer increased OXPHOS. We describe a new mechanism by which MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase modulates the UBXN7 cofactor protein level and provides a reciprocal regulation of CRL3KEAP1 and CRL2VHL ubiquitin ligase complexes. Furthermore, we delineate how this regulation is reflected in NRF2 and HIF-1α accumulation and determines the metabolic state as well as the adaptive response to mitochondrial stress.

Abstract: C1orf61 is a specific transcriptional activator that is highly up-regulated during weeks 4–9 of human embryogenesis, the period in which most organs develop. We have previously demonstrated that C1orf61 acts as a tumor activator in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression in HCC remain obscure. In this study, we demonstrated that the pattern of C1orf61 expression was closely correlated with metastasis in liver cancer cells. Gene expression profiling analysis indicated that C1orf61 regulated diverse genes related to cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Results showed that C1orf61 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by inducing cellular EMT in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, C1orf61-induced cellular EMT and migration are involved in the activation of the STAT3 and Akt cascade pathways. In addition, C1orf61 expression improved the efficacy of the anticancer therapy sorafenib in HCC patients. For the first time, we report a regulatory pathway by which C1orf61 promoted cancer cell metastasis and regulated the therapeutic response to sorafenib. These findings increased our understanding of the molecular events that regulate metastasis and treatment in HCC.

Abstract: The enzymatic characteristics of the ubiquitous calpain 5 (CAPN5) remain undescribed despite its high expression in the central nervous system and links to eye development and disease. CAPN5 contains the typical protease core domains but lacks the C terminal penta-EF hand domain of classical calpains, and instead contains a putative C2 domain. This study used the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line stably transfected with CAPN5-3xFLAG variants to assess the potential roles of the CAPN5 C2 domain in Ca2+ regulated enzyme activity and intracellular localization. Calcium dependent autoproteolysis of CAPN5 was documented and characterized. Mutation of the catalytic Cys81 to Ala or addition of EGTA prevented autolysis. Eighty μM Ca2+ was sufficient to stimulate half-maximal CAPN5 autolysis in cellular lysates. CAPN5 autolysis was inhibited by tri-leucine peptidyl aldehydes, but less effectively by di-Leu aldehydes, consistent with a more open conformation of the protease core relative to classical calpains. In silico modeling revealed a type II topology C2 domain including loops with the potential to bind calcium. Mutation of the acidic amino acid residues predicted to participate in Ca2+ binding, particularly Asp531 and Asp589, resulted in a decrease of CAPN5 membrane association. These residues were also found to be invariant in several genomes. The autolytic fragment of CAPN5 was prevalent in membrane-enriched fractions, but not in cytosolic fractions, suggesting that membrane association facilitates the autoproteolytic activity of CAPN5. Together, these results demonstrate that CAPN5 undergoes Ca2+-activated autoproteolytic processing and suggest that CAPN5 association with membranes enhances CAPN5 autolysis.

Abstract: Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death characterized by a lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides due to an increase of intracellular iron and a decrease of antioxidant capacity. The reduction of antioxidant activity is obtained by using chemical agents, such as erastin and RSL3, the first one inhibiting the transmembrane cystine-glutamate antiporter causing a cysteine and glutathione depletion and the second one inactivating directly the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) respectively. The role of iron and its related proteins in supporting the formation of lipid peroxides, is not completely understood hence to try to shed light on it we generated HeLa clones with altered ferritinophagy, the ferritin degradation process, by knocking-out or overexpressing Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NCOA4), the ferritin autophagic cargo-receptor. NCOA4 deficiency abolished ferritinophagy increasing ferritin level and making the cells more resistant to erastin, but unexpectedly more sensitive to RSL3. Interestingly, we found that erastin promoted ferritinophagy in HeLa cells expressing NCOA4, increasing the free iron, lipid peroxidation and the sensitivity to ferroptosis. In contrast, RSL3 did not modulate ferritinophagy, while NCOA4 overexpression delayed RSL3-induced cell death suggesting that RSL3 mechanism of action is independent of ferritin degradation process. Therefore, the ferritin-iron release in the execution of ferroptosis seems to depend on the inducing compound, its target and downstream pathway of cell death activation.

Abstract: In our previous study, it showed that P-3F, a podophyllotoxin derivative, causes the increased level of p53 expression by enhancing p53 stability, resulting from blockage of the Mdm2-p53 feedback loop via nucleolus-to-nucleoplasm translocation of Rps27a in human cervical cancer HeLa cell line. However, the mechanism of regulating Rps27a localization remains to be studied. In the current study, it has been demonstrated that the level of protein interacting with carboxyl terminus 1 (PICT1), originally identified as a tumor suppressor, was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in response to P-3F, leading to inhibition of human cervical cancer cell lines proliferation. Also remarkably, reduction of serine phosphorylation of STMN1 at position 16 induced by P-3F was required in the downregulation of PICT1, in which p53 activity was likely to be directly involved. Note as well that, PICT1 also played an important role in p53 stability enhancement by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination due to Rps27a translocation from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm to interact with Mdm2 following treatment with P-3F. Collectively, these findings indicated that P-3F, a microtubule polymerization inhibitor, promotes the decreased level of PICT1 expression, which is critical for regulating the Rps27a-Mdm2-p53 pathway against cervical cancer.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the most frequent cause of gynecologic malignancies associated death. Primary or acquired cisplatin resistance is frequently occurred during ovarian cancer therapy. Cancer stem cells (CSC) tend to form minimal residual disease after chemotherapy and are implicated in relapse. The ability of cancer cells to reprogram their metabolism has recently been related with maintenance of CSC and resistance to chemotherapies. The current study found that BAG5 expression was decreased in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and clinical tissues. Our data demonstrated that BAG5 knockdown was implicated in metabolic reprogramming and maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like features of ovarian cancer cells via regulation of Rictor and subsequent mTORC2 signaling pathway. In addition, the current study demonstrated that Bcl6 upregulation was responsible for repression of BAG5 transactivation via recruitment on the BAG5 promoter in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. The current study also demonstrated reverse correlations between BAG5 and Bcl6, BAG5 and Rictor in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma tissues. Collectively, the current study identified the implication of Bcl6/BAG5/Rictor-mTORC2 signaling pathway in metabolic reprograming and maintenance of CSC-like features in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, further studies on the mechanism underlying regulation of metabolic reprogramming and CSC-like characteristics of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells may contribute to the establishment of novel therapeutic strategy for cisplatin-resistance.

Abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognosis due to lack of biomarker and therapeutic target. Emerging research has revealed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in breast cancer progression, but their functions and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in TNBC. In this study, we performed lncRNA microarray analysis of five TNBC samples and their matched normal tissues, and discovered a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs. We identified an antisense lncRNA, HYOU1-AS, which is transcribed from the opposite strand of the hypoxia up-regulated 1 (HYOU1) gene, enriched in the nucleus and highly expressed in TNBC. HYOU1-AS knockdown could inhibit the proliferation and migration of the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells, and reduce their xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. In mechanistic studies, we found that HYOU1-AS could promote the expression of HYOU1, a proliferative gene, through competitively binding to hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein, to relieve its post-transcriptional inhibition of the HYOU1 mRNA. Consistently, increased HYOU1 levels correlated with poor clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients based on our study of the TCGA database. Overall, our data indicated that the lncRNA HYOU1-AS promoted TNBC progression through upregulating HYOU1.

Abstract: Due to its potent anti-tumor activity, well-investigated pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile, disulfiram (DSF) has emerged as a promising candidate for drug repurposing in cancer therapy. Although several molecular mechanisms have been proposed for its anti-cancer effects, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that DSF inhibited proliferation of cancer cells by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a G1 cell cycle arrest and autophagy. Moreover, DSF triggered apoptosis via suppression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. To elucidate the mechanisms for the anti-proliferative activities of DSF, we applied a 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in breast cancer cells upon treatment with DSF. Nine differentially expressed proteins were identified among which, three candidates including calmodulin (CaM), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) are involved in the regulation of the AKT signaling pathway. The results of western blot analysis confirmed that DSF inhibited p-AKT, suggesting that DSF induces its anti-tumor effects via AKT blockade. Moreover, we found that DSF increased the mRNA levels of FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4, and upregulated the expression of their target genes involved in G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, DSF potentiated the anti-proliferative effects of well-known chemotherapeutic agents such as arsenic trioxide (ATO), doxorubicin, paclitaxel and cisplatin. Altogether, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the anti-growth activities of DSF.

Abstract: Platelets have been extensively implicated in the progression of cancer and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) are gaining growing attention as potential mediators of the platelet-cancer interplay. PEVs are shed from platelet membrane in response to extracellular stimuli and carry important biological signals for intercellular communication. In this study we demonstrate that PEVs specifically bind to different breast cancer cells and elicit cell-specific functional responses. PEVs were massively internalized by the metastatic cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 and the ductal carcinoma cell line BT474, but not by the MCF-7 cell line. In SKBR3 cells, PEVs decreased mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities and altered cell cycle progression without affecting cell viability. Conversely, PEVs potently stimulated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231, without affecting the distribution in the different phases of the cell cycle. In all the analyzed breast cancer cells, PEVs triggered a sustained increase of intracellular Ca2+, but only in MDA-MB-231 cells, this was associated to the stimulation of selected signaling proteins implicated in migration, including p38MAPK and myosin light chain. Importantly, inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation by a Rho kinase inhibitor prevented PEVs-stimulated migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results demonstrate that PEVs are versatile regulators of cancer cell behavior and elicit a variety of different responses depending on the specific breast cancer cell subtype.

Abstract: Photoreceptor cell (PHR) death is a hallmark of most retinal neurodegenerative diseases, in which inflammation plays a critical role. Activation of retinoid X receptors (RXR) modulates and integrates multiple cell functions, and has beneficial effects in animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases. Nonetheless, the mechanisms involved and their role in retina neuroprotection are poorly understood. In this work we assessed whether RXR activation prevents inflammation and/or PHR death in retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited retina neurodegeneration, using as an ex vivo model, retinas from the rd1 mice, a murine model of this disease. We demonstrated that rd1 retinas had lower levels of RXR alpha isoform than their wt counterparts at early developmental times, whereas its distribution pattern remained similar. In mixed neuro-glial cultures obtained from either rd1 or wt retinas, both PHR and Müller glial cells (MGC) expressed RXRalpha, and RXR activation by its synthetic pan-agonist PA024 selectively increased mRNA levels of RXRgamma isoform. PA024 decreased PHR death in rd1 mixed cultures; it reduced the amount of non-viable neurons, delayed the onset of PHR apoptosis, and decreased Bax mRNA levels. PA024 also reduced MGC reactivity in vitro before and at the onset of degeneration, decreasing GFAP expression, increasing glutamine synthetase mRNA levels, and promoting the transcription of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, Il-10. These results suggest that RXR activation rescues rd1 PHR and decreases MGC reactivity, promoting an anti-inflammatory environment in the rd1 retina, thus supporting the potential of RXR agonists as pharmacological tools for treating retina degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Adipogenesis is a finely orchestrated program involving a transcriptional cascade coordinated by CEBP and PPAR family members and by hormonally induced signaling pathways. Alterations in any of these factors result into impaired formation of fully differentiated adipocytes. Tm7sf2 gene encodes for a Δ(14)-sterol reductase primarily involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, TM7SF2 modulates the expression of the master gene of adipogenesis PPARγ, suggesting a role in the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis. We investigated the differentiation of Tm7sf2−/− MEFs into adipocytes, compared to Tm7sf2+/+ MEFs. Tm7sf2 expression was increased at late stage of differentiation in wild type cells, while Tm7sf2−/− MEFs exhibited a reduced capacity to differentiate into mature adipocytes. Indeed, Tm7sf2−/− MEFs had lower neutral lipid accumulation and reduced expression of adipogenic regulators. At early stage, the reduction in C/EBPβ expression impaired mitotic clonal expansion, which is needed by preadipocytes for adipogenesis induction. At late stage, the expression and activity of C/EBPα and PPARγ were inhibited in Tm7sf2−/− cells, leading to the reduced expression of adipocyte genes like Srebp-1c, Fasn, Scd-1, Adipoq, Fabp4, and Glut4. Loss of the acquisition of adipocyte phenotype was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of Irs1, and phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2, indicating a blunted insulin signaling in differentiating Tm7sf2−/− cells. Moreover, throughout the differentiation process, increased expression of the antiadipogenic Mmp3 was observed in MEFs lacking Tm7sf2. These findings indicate Tm7sf2 as a novel factor influencing adipocyte differentiation that could be relevant to adipose tissue development and maintenance of metabolic health.

Abstract: Cancer emergence is associated with cellular adaptations to altered signal transduction mechanisms arbitrated by mutated kinases. Since conventional kinase inhibitors can exhibit certain limitations to such kinase adaptations, overcoming kinase adaptation for cancer treatment gains importance. The cancer chaperone, Hsp90, is implicated in the conformational maturation and functional stabilization of mutated gene products. However, its role in kinase adaptations is not explored in detail. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the mechanisms of Hsp90-dependent kinase adaptation and develop a novel antitumor strategy. We chose malignant human lung cancer cells to demonstrate Hsp90-dependent RAF oncogene adaptation. We show that RAF oncogene adaptations were predominant over wild type RAF and are facilitated by conformation-specific Hsp90. Consequently, the conformation-specific Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG, interfered with oncogenic RAF stability and function and inhibited cell proliferation. The enforced cytostasis further triggered premature cellular senescence and acted as an efficient and irreversible tumor suppressor mechanism. Our results also display that oncogenic RAF interactions with Hsp90 require the middle-charged region of the chaperone. Our mice xenografts revealed that 17AAG pretreated tumor cells lost their ability to proliferate and metastasize in vivo. In summary, we demonstrated Hsp90-dependent kinase adaptation in tumor cells and the effect of Hsp90 inhibition in triggering premature senescence to interfere with the tumor progression. Our findings are of both biological relevance and clinical importance.

Abstract: Spastin, a microtubule-severing AAA ATPase, regulates microtubule dynamics and plays important roles in cell division and neurogenesis. Mutations in the spastin-coding gene SPAST lead to neurodegenerative disorders and cause spastic paraplegia type 4. Spastin has two main isoforms, M1 and M87, that differ only in the presence or absence of 86 N-terminal amino acids and have alternative splicing variants that lack exon4. The N-terminal region of M1 contains a hydrophobic domain, nuclear localization signal (NLS), and nuclear export signal (NES), which partly explains the differences in the two isoforms' localization. However, the mechanisms involved in regulating isoform localization, and the effects of localization on spastin functions are not fully understood. We found endogenous M1 and M87 shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm during the cell cycle. We identified a NES (amino acids 195–204) that spans the microtubule-interacting and endosomal-trafficking domain and exon4 region. Furthermore, the NES sequence contains both the coiled-coil and exon4 region of spastin isoforms. Highly conserved leucine 195 in exon3 and the two residues in exon4 are crucial for predicted coiled-coil formation. Mutations in NES or leptomycin B treatment reduced cytoplasmic localization and microtubule fragmentation in M87 rather than in M1. Phosphomimetic mutation of threonine 306 adjacent to the NLS (amino acids 309–312) inhibited nuclear transport of M87. Our results indicate that the newly identified NES in the spastin isoforms containing exon4 regulates the subcellular localization of spastin in coordination with NLS controlled by the phosphorylation state of spastin, and is involved in microtubule severing.

Abstract: Intracellular pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii often target proteins and pathways critical for host cell survival and stress response. Molecular chaperones encoded by the evolutionary conserved Heat shock proteins (Hsps) maintain proteostasis and are vital to cell survival following exposure to any form of stress. A key protein of this family is Hsp70, an ATP-driven molecular chaperone, which is stress inducible and often indiscernible in normal cells. Role of this protein with respect to intracellular survival and multiplication of protozoan parasite like T. gondii remains to be examined. We find that T. gondii infection upregulates expression of host Hsp70. Hsp70 selective inhibitor 2-phenylethynesulfonamide (PES) attenuates intracellular T. gondii multiplication. Biotinylated PES confirms selective interaction of this small molecule inhibitor with Hsp70. We show that PES acts by disrupting Hsp70 chaperone function which leads to dysregulation of host autophagy. Silencing of host Hsp70 underscores its importance for intracellular multiplication of T. gondii, however, attenuation achieved using PES is not completely attributable to host Hsp70 indicating the presence of other intracellular targets of PES in infected host cells. We find that PES is also able to target T. gondii Hsp70 homologue which was shown using PES binding assay. Detailed molecular docking analysis substantiates PES targeting of TgHsp70 in addition to host Hsp70. While establishing the importance of protein quality control in infection, this study brings to the fore a unique opportunity of dual targeting of host and parasite Hsp70 demonstrating how structural conservation of these proteins may be exploited for therapeutic design.

Abstract: Airway wall remodeling, a main pathology of asthma was linked to vitamin-D deficiency and protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) expression in sub-epithelial cell layers. Calcitriol reduced remodeling in asthma model, but its mode of action is unclear. This study assessed the effect of calcitriol on PRMT1-dependent fibroblast remodeling in human lung fibroblasts, and allergen-induced asthma in E3-rats. Fibroblasts were activated with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TLSP); asthma was induced by ovalbumin inhalation in rats. The airway structure was assessed by immunohistology. Protein expression in fibroblasts and activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases were detected by Western-blotting. Transcription factor activation was determined by luciferase reporter assay. PRMT1 action was blocked by siRNA and PRMT-inhibition. Ovalbumin upregulated the expression of TSLP, PRMT1, matrix metallopro-teinase-1 (MMP1), interleukin-25, and collagen type-I in sub-epithelial fibroblasts. In isolated fibroblasts, TSLP induced the same proteins, which were blocked by inhibition of Erk1/2 and p38. TLSP induced PRMT1 through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3. PRMT1 inhibition reduced collagen type-I expression and suppressed MMP1. In fibroblasts, calcitriol supplementation over 12 days prevented TSLP-induced remodeling by blocking the PRMT1 levels. Interestingly, short-term calcitriol treatment had no such effect. The data support the beneficial role of calcitriol in asthma therapy.

Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO), a versatile free radical and a signalling molecule, plays an important role in the haematopoiesis, inflammation and infection. Impaired proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells lead to malignancies and Hematopoietic deficiencies. This study was aimed to define the role of nNOS derived NO in neutrophil differentiation (in-vitro) and granulopoiesis (in-vivo) using multipronged approaches. The results obtained from nNOS over-expressing K562 cells revealed induction in C/EBPα derived neutrophil differentiation as evident by an increase in the expression of neutrophil specific cell surface markers, genes, transcription factors and functionality. nNOS mediated response also involved G-CSFR-STAT-3 axis during differentiation. Consistent increase in NO generation was observed during neutrophil differentiation of mice and human CD34+ HSPCs. Furthermore, granulopoiesis was abrogated in the nNOS inhibitor treated mice, depicting a decrease in the numbers of BM mature and progenitor neutrophils. Likewise, in vitro inhibition of nNOS in human CD34+ HSPCs indicated an indispensable role of nNOS in neutrophil differentiation. Expression of nNOS inhibitory protein, NOSIP was significantly and consistently decreased during the final stage of differentiation and was linked with the augmentation in NO release. Moreover, neutrophils from CML patients had more NOSIP and less NO generation as compared to the PMNs from healthy individuals. The present study thus indicates a critical role of nNOS, and its interaction with NOSIP during neutrophil differentiation. The study also highlights the importance of nNOS in the neutrophil progenitor proliferation and differentiation warranting investigations to assess its role in the haematopoiesis-related disorders.

Abstract: Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) protein has been shown to inhibit CRC proliferation. Previously, we reported that SIRT2 plays an important role in the maintenance of normal intestinal cell homeostasis. Here, we show that SIRT2 is a direct target gene of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells. Inhibition or knockdown of Wnt/β-catenin increased SIRT2 promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression, whereas activation of Wnt/β-catenin decreased SIRT2 promoter activity and expression. β-Catenin was recruited to the promoter of SIRT2 and transcriptionally regulated SIRT2 expression. Wnt/β-catenin inhibition increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CRC cell differentiation. Moreover, inhibition of OXPHOS attenuated the differentiation of CRC cells induced by Wnt/β-catenin inhibition. In contrast, inhibition or knockdown of SIRT2 decreased, while overexpression of SIRT2 increased, OXPHOS activity and differentiation in CRC cells. Consistently, inhibition or knockdown or SIRT2 attenuated the differentiation induced by Wnt/β-catenin inhibition. These results demonstrate that SIRT2 is a novel target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and contributes to the differentiation of CRC cells.

Abstract: Periodontitis is a widespread chronic infectious-inflammatory disease associated with multiple systemic diseases. Visfatin is an adipokine-enzyme that can be locally produced by human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) and human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). It can upregulate proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in various types of cells. However, the effects of visfatin on healthy and inflammatory human periodontal cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study firstly demonstrated visfatin expression was highly elevated in inflamed human gingiva and Pg LPS-treated hPDLCs. Moreover, recombinant visfatin significantly upregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and prodegradative factors (EMPPRIN, MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13) in hPDLCs. Next, we found the levels of proinflammatory and prodegradative cytokines were significantly increased in visfatin-overexpressing hPDLCs, and decreased in visfatin-silencing inflammatory hGFs (iGFs) when treated with Pg LPS. In the absence of Pg LPS, visfatin silencing failed to affect the expression of these factors in iGFs, and overexpression of visfatin upregulated MMPs but no other factors in hPDLCs. Furthermore, marked NF-κB pathway activation with increased phosphorylation of p65 was observed in visfatin-overexpressing hPDLCs. BAY11-7082, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, partially reversed the upregulation proinflammatory and prodegradative factors induced by visfatin overexpression. Taken together, this study showed that visfatin critically regulates Pg LPS-induced proinflammatory/prodegradative effects in healthy and inflammatory periodontal cells partially via NF-κB pathway. The findings suggest that visfatin is closely involved in the development of periodontitis, and may serve as a promising novel biomarker and therapeutic target for periodontitis management.

Abstract: Despite continuous exertion made, colon cancer still represents a major health problem and its incidence continues being high worldwide. There is growing evidence in support of the cancer stem cells (CSCs) being central in the initiation of this cancer, and CSCs have been the focus of various studies for the identification of new ways of treatment. Lately, the proprotein convertases (PCs) were reported to regulate the maturation and expression of various molecules involved in the malignant phenotype of colon cancer cells, however, the identity of the molecules regulated by these serine proteases in CSCs is unknown. In this study, we used the general PCs inhibitor, the Decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK) that inhibits all the PCs found in the secretory pathway, and analyzed its effect on CSCs using RNA-seq analysis. Remarkably, from the only 9 up-regulated genes in the human SW620-derived sphere-forming cells, we identified 7 of the 11 human metallothioneins, all of them localized on chromosome 16, and zinc related proteins as downstream effectors of the PCs. The importance of these molecules in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and chemoresistance, and their reported potential tumor suppressor role and loss in colon cancer patients associated with worse prognosis, suggests that targeting PCs in the control of the malignant phenotype of CSCs is a new potential therapeutic strategy in colon cancer.

Abstract: Iron is an essential element for life. Cells develop mechanisms to tightly regulate its homeostasis, in order to avoid abnormal accumulation and the consequent cell toxicity. In budding yeast, the high affinity iron regulon is under the control of the transcription factor Aft1. We present evidence demonstrating that the MAPK Slt2 of the cell wall integrity pathway (CWI), phosphorylates and negatively regulates Aft1 activity upon the iron depletion signal, both in fermentative or respiratory conditions. The lack of Slt2 provokes Aft1 dysfunction leading to a shorter chronological life span. The signal of iron scarcity is not transmitted to Slt2 through other signalling pathways such as TOR1, PKA, SNF1 or TOR2/YPK1. The observation that Slt2 physically binds Aft1 rather suggests a direct regulation.

Abstract: The emergence of endo-lysosomes as ubiquitous Ca2+ stores with their unique cohort of channels has resulted in their being implicated in a growing number of processes in an ever-increasing number of cell types. The architectural and regulatory constraints of these acidic Ca2+ stores distinguishes them from other larger Ca2+ sources such as the ER and influx across the plasma membrane. In view of recent advances in the understanding of the modes of operation, we discuss phagocytosis as a template for how endo-lysosomal Ca2+ signals (generated via TPC and TRPML channels) can be integrated in multiple sophisticated ways into biological processes. Phagocytosis illustrates how different endo-lysosomal Ca2+ signals drive different phases of a process, and how these can be altered by disease or infection.

Abstract: Plant latex proteases (PLPs) are pharmacologically essential and are integral components of traditional medicine in the management of bleeding wounds. PLPs are known to promote blood coagulation and stop bleeding by interfering at various stages of hemostasis. There are a handful of scientific reports on thrombin-like enzymes characterized from plant latices. However, the role of plant latex thrombin-like enzymes in platelet aggregation is not well known. In the present study, we attempted to purify and characterize thrombin-like protease responsible for platelet aggregation. Among tested plant latices, Euphorbia genus latex protease fractions (LPFs) induced platelet aggregation. In Euphorbia genus, E. antiquorum LPF (EaLPF) strongly induced platelet aggregation and attenuated bleeding in mice. The purified thrombin-like serine protease, antiquorin (Aqn) is a glycoprotein with platelet aggregating activities that interfere in intrinsic and common pathways of blood coagulation cascade and alleviates bleeding and enhanced excision wound healing in mice. In continuation, the pharmacological inhibitor of PAR1 inhibited Aqn-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2, Akt, and P38 in human platelets. Moreover, Aqn-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors of PAR1, PI3K, and P38. These data indicate that PAR1-Akt/P38 signaling pathways are involved in Aqn-induced platelet aggregation. The findings of the present study may open up a new avenue for exploiting Aqn in the treatment of bleeding wounds.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive cell source for tissue regeneration and repair. However, their low differentiation efficacy currently impedes the development of MSC therapy. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) on the differentiation efficacy of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) into adipogenic or osteogenic lineages. BM-MSCs, which were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats, were positive for the MSC markers (CD29, CD73, and CD90). DIF-1 alone neither affected cell surface antigen expression nor induced adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation. However, DIF-1 significantly enhanced the effects of adipogenic differentiation stimuli, which were evaluated as the number of oil red-O positive cells and the expression of adipocyte differentiation markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, and adiponectin). In contrast, DIF-1 significantly attenuated the effects of osteogenic differentiation stimuli, which were evaluated as alizarin red-S positive calcium deposition, and the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, and osteopontin. We further investigated the mechanism by which DIF-1 affects MSC differentiation efficacy and found that glycogen synthase kinase-3 was the main factor mediating the action of DIF-1 on the adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs, whereas it was only partially involved in osteogenic differentiation. These results suggest that DIF-1 supports MSC differentiation toward the desired cell fate by enhancing the differentiation efficacy.

Abstract: Intracellular organelle cross-talk is a new and important research area. Under stress conditions, the coordinated action of the autophagy and endosomal systems in tumor cells is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival. The activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex is also involved in the regulation of stress and homeostasis in tumor cells. Here, we try to explore the effects of constitutively active IKKβ subunits (CA-IKKβ) on autophagy and endosomal system interactions. We confirm that CA-IKKβ induces accumulation of autophagosomes and their fusion with MVBs to form amphisomes in cancer cells, and also drives the release of EVs containing autophagy components through an amphisome-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrate that CA-IKKβ inhibits the expression of RAB7, thereby weakening the lysosomal-dependent degradation pathway. CA-IKKβ also induces phosphorylation of SNAP23 at Ser95 instead of Ser110, which further promotes amphisome-plasma membrane fusion and sEV secretion. These results indicate that CA-IKKβ drives the formation and transport of amphisomes, thereby regulating tumor cell homeostasis, which may illuminate a special survival mechanism in tumor cells under stress.

Abstract: Background
Fasting changes mitochondrial function, and mTOR acts as a major regulator of mitochondrial energy production ensuring the survival under reduced supply of nutrition. This study assessed the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which regulates mitochondrial function, in the context of fasting.
Methods
The effect of fasting on mTOR signaling and mTOR-regulated mitochondrial mass was assessed in LO2 cells (in vitro) and C57BL/6J mice (in vivo). Biochemical parameters of fasting were determined in blood samples of mice. PRMT1 expression was investigated by transfecting LO2 cells with an expression vector. Gene expression was determined by real-time quantitative PCR, protein interaction by chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy, and the mitochondrial mass by MitoTracker staining.
Results
After 48 h of fasting, mTOR and PRMT1 expression, as well as mitochondrial mass, were significantly reduced in LO2 cells, and in liver tissue sections. Fasting downregulated the expression of miR-21 and upregulated the expression of its target phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which was responsible for reduced mTOR expression. Inhibition of mTOR reduced phosphorylation of STAT1, and thereby PRMT1 expression in LO2 cells. Low PRMT1 down-regulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ and thereby decreased mitochondrial mass. Supplementation of insulin contracted the effect of fasting on all mentioned parameters.
Conclusions
Fasting downregulates miR-21 and increases its target PTEN, thereby inhibiting mTOR signaling, p-STAT1, PRMT1, and mitochondrial mass. These findings highlight the role of mTOR and PRMT1 in the regulation of cellular energy availability.

Abstract: Mitochondrial ATP-synthesis is catalyzed by a F1Fo-ATP synthase, an enzyme of dual genetic origin enriched at the edge of cristae where it plays a key role in their structure/stability. The enzyme's biogenesis remains poorly understood, both from a mechanistic and a compartmentalization point of view. The present study provides novel molecular insights into this process through investigations on a human protein called TMEM70 with an unclear role in the assembly of ATP synthase. A recent study has revealed the existence of physical interactions between TMEM70 and the subunit c (Su.c), a protein present in 8 identical copies forming a transmembrane oligomeric ring (c-ring) within the ATP synthase proton translocating domain (Fo). Herein we analyzed the ATP-synthase assembly in cells lacking TMEM70, mitochondrial DNA or F1 subunits and observe a direct correlation between TMEM70 and Su.c levels, regardless of the status of other ATP synthase subunits or of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Immunoprecipitation, two-dimensional blue-native/SDS-PAGE, and pulse-chase experiments reveal that TMEM70 forms large oligomers that interact with Su.c not yet incorporated into ATP synthase complexes. Moreover, discrete TMEM70-Su.c complexes with increasing Su.c contents can be detected, suggesting a role for TMEM70 oligomers in the gradual assembly of the c-ring. Furthermore, we demonstrate using expansion super-resolution microscopy the specific localization of TMEM70 at the inner cristae membrane, distinct from the MICOS component MIC60. Taken together, our results show that TMEM70 oligomers provide a scaffold for c-ring assembly and that mammalian ATP synthase is assembled within inner cristae membranes.

Abstract: The mouse 3110001I22Rik gene located in the first intron of Bfar is considered as a Bfar variant coding for the BFARv3 protein. However, it differs from other BFAR isoforms and resembles periphilin 1 (PPHLN1) due to its two (Lge1 and serine-rich) conserved domains. We identified the BFARv3/EGFP-interacting proteins by co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, which revealed 40S ribosomal proteins (RPS3, RPS14, RPS19, RPS25, RPS27), histones (H1.2, H1.4, H3.3C), proteins involved in RNA processing and splicing (SFPQ, SNRPA1, HNRNPA3, NONO, KHDRBS3), calcium signaling (HPCAL1, PTK2B), as well as HSD17B4, GRB14, POSTN, and MYO10. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that both Lge1 and Ser-rich domains of BFARv3 were necessary for binding to RNA-interacting factors NONO and SFPQ, known to be components of paraspeckles. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation assay confirmed that both BFARv3 and PPHLN1 could interact with NONO and SFPQ, suggesting a new function for PPHLN1 as well. BFARv3 and its Lge1 or Ser-rich-deficient mutants preferentially localize in the nucleus. We found an accumulation of BFARv3/EGFP (but not its mutated forms) in the nuclear granules, which was enhanced in response to arsenite treatment and ionizing radiation. Although Bfar v3 is expressed ubiquitously in mouse tissues, its expression is the highest in metaphase II oocytes. The BFARv3 interactome suggests its role in RNA metabolism, which is critical for the transcriptionally silent MII oocyte. Mouse BFARv3 has no ortholog in the human genome, thus it may contribute to the differences between these two species observed in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is defined as “a serious imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defences in favour of ROS, causing excessive oxidative damage to biomolecules”. Different stressors that induce autophagy, such as starvation and hypoxia, can increase production of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This review provides brief summaries about oxidative stress and macroautophagy, and then considers current knowledge about the complex interactions between ROS and autophagy. ROS-induced autophagy could be a cellular protective mechanism that alleviates oxidative stress, or a destructive process. Increased ROS levels can regulate autophagy through several different pathways, such as activation of the AMPK signalling cascade and ULK1 complex, Atg4 oxidation, disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 interaction, and alteration of mitochondrial homeostasis leading to mitophagy. Autophagic degradation of Keap1 activates the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 and protects cells against ROS. Autophagy activation can, in turn, regulate oxidative stress by recycling damaged ROS-producing mitochondria. Macroautophagy plays an important role in degradation of large aggregates of oxidatively damaged/unfolded proteins, which are removed by the autophagy-lysosomal system. ROS can regulate autophagy, and in turn, autophagy can regulate oxidative stress. Future studies are necessary to improve understanding of the complex interactions between autophagy and oxidative stress.

Abstract: Calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, plays a significant role in gene expression, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Mutations in human calpain-5 cause autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy and the inhibition of calpain-5 activity may constitute an effective therapeutic strategy for this condition. Although calpain-5 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and was recently found to be present in the mitochondria as well as in the cytosol, its physiological function and enzymological properties require further elucidation. The objective of the current study was to determine the characteristics of mitochondrial calpain-5 in porcine retinas, human HeLa cells, and C57BL/6J mice using subcellular fractionation. We found that mitochondrial calpain-5 was proteolyzed/autolyzed at low Ca2+ concentrations in mitochondria isolated from porcine retinas and by thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in HeLa cells. Further, mitochondrial calpain-5, as opposed to cytosolic calpain-5, was activated during the early stages of ER stress in C57BL/6J mice. These results showed that mitochondrial calpain-5 was activated at low Ca2+ concentrations in vitro and in response to ER stress in vivo. The present study provides new insights into a novel calpain system in the mitochondria that includes stress responses during the early phases of ER stress. Further, activation of mitochondrial calpain-5 by treatment using low-molecular-weight compounds may have therapeutic potential for diseases related to ER stress, including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, diabetes, and cancer.

Abstract: The widely conserved twin-arginine translocases (Tat) allow the transport of fully folded cofactor-containing proteins across biological membranes. In doing so, these translocases serve different biological functions ranging from energy conversion to cell division. In the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the Tat machinery is essential for effective growth in media lacking iron or NaCl. It was previously shown that this phenomenon relates to the Tat-dependent export of the heme-containing peroxidase EfeB, which converts Fe2+ to Fe3+ at the expense of hydrogen peroxide. However, the reasons why the majority of tat mutant bacteria perish upon dilution in NaCl-deprived medium and how, after several hours, a sub-population adapts to this condition was unknown. Here we show that, upon growth in the absence of NaCl, the bacteria face two major problems, namely severe oxidative stress at the membrane and starvation leading to death. The tat mutant cells can overcome these challenges if they are fed with arginine, which implies that severe arginine depletion is a major cause of death and resumed arginine synthesis permits their survival. Altogether, our findings show that the Tat system of B. subtilis is needed to preclude severe oxidative stress and starvation upon sudden drops in the environmental Na+ concentration as caused by flooding or rain.

Abstract: The neuropeptide 26RFa plays important roles in the regulation of many physiological functions. 26RFa has been recognized as an endogenous ligand for receptor GPR103. In the present study, we demonstrate that GPR103 dually couples to Gαq and Gαi/o proteins. However, two naturally occurring missense mutations were identified from a young male patient. In the first, Y68H, induction of Ca2+ mobilization was noted without detection of ERK1/2 activation. In the second, R371W, the potential to activate ERK1/2 signaling was retained but with failure to evoke Ca2+ mobilization. Further analysis provides evidence that Gαq, L-type Ca2+ channel and PKCβI and βII are involved in the Y68H-mediated signaling pathway, whereas Gαi/o, Gβγ, and PKCζ are implicated in the R371W-induced signaling. Our results demonstrate that two point mutations, Y68H and R371W, affect the equilibrium between the different receptor conformations, leading to alteration of G protein-coupling preferences. Importantly, these findings provide a foundation for future elucidation of GPCR-mediated biased signaling and the physiological implications of their bias.

Abstract: Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been widely used in the clinical treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations. Previous studies have shown that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of cancer cells, which can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute to the occurrence of acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. However, whether the inhibition of AURKA could overcome EGFR-TKI resistance or reverse the EMT in TKI-resistant NSCLC cells remains unclear. In the current study, we established three EGFR-TKI-resistant cell lines and analyzed their expression profiles by RNA sequencing. The results revealed that the EMT pathway is significantly upregulated in the three cell lines with EGFR-TKI resistance. The phosphorylation of AURKA at Thr 288 was also upregulated, suggesting that the activation of AURKA plays an important role in the occurrence of EGFR-TKI resistance. Interestingly, the AURKA inhibitor, alisertib treatment restored the susceptibility of resistant cells to EGFR-TKIs and partially reversed the EMT process, thereby reducing migration and invasion in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells. This study provides evidence that targeting AURKA signaling pathway by alisertib may be a novel approach for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance and for the treatment of metastatic EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration play a central role in many fundamental cellular processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, cell proliferation, differentiation, gene transcription and cell death. Many of these processes are known to be regulated by store-operated calcium channels (SOCs), among which ORAI1 is the most studied in cancer cells, leaving the role of other ORAI channels yet inadequately addressed. Here we demonstrate that ORAI3 channels are expressed in both normal (HPDE) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, where they form functional channels, their knockdown affecting store operated calcium entry (SOCE). More specifically, ORAI3 silencing increased SOCE in PDAC cell lines, while decreasing SOCE in normal pancreatic cell line. We also show the role of ORAI3 in proliferation, cell cycle, viability, mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that ORAI3 silencing impairs pancreatic tumor growth and induces cell death in vivo, suggesting that ORAI3 could represent a potential therapeutic target in PDAC treatment.

Abstract: In this work, the effect of an early oxidative stress on human endothelial cells induced by menadione was studied using a combined methodology of label-free Raman imaging and fluorescence staining. Menadione-induced ROS-dependent endothelial inflammation in human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) was studied with focus on changes in cytochrome, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids content and their distribution in cells. Fluorescence staining (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, vWF, LipidTox, MitoRos and DCF) was used to confirm endothelial inflammation and ROS generation. The results showed that short time, exposure to menadione did not cause their apoptosis or necrosis (Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit) within the 3 h timescale of measurement. On the other hand, 3 h of incubation, did result in endothelial inflammation (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, vWF) that was associated with an increased ROS formation (MitoRos and DCF) suggesting the oxidative stress-mediated inflammation. Chemometric analysis of spectral data enabled the determination of spectroscopic markers of menadione-induced oxidative stress–mediated endothelial inflammation including a decrease of the bands intensity of cytochrome (604, 750, 1128, 1315 and 1585 cm−1), nucleic acids bands (785 cm−1), proteins (1005 cm−1) and increased intensity of lipid bands (722, 1085, 1265, 1303, 1445 and 1660 cm−1), without changes in the spectroscopic signature of the cell nucleus. In conclusion, oxidative stress resulting in endothelial inflammation was featured by significant alterations in the number of biochemical changes in mitochondria and other cellular compartments detected by Raman spectroscopy. Most of these, coexisted with results from fluorescence imaging, and most importantly occurred earlier than the detection of increased ROS or markers of endothelial inflammation.

Abstract: We previously reported that vestigial-like 1 (VGLL1), a cofactor of transcriptional enhanced associate domain 4 (TEAD4), is transcriptionally regulated by PI3K and β-catenin signaling and is involved in gastric cancer malignancy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the regulation of VGLL1 activation remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–mediated activation of VGLL1 and the VGLL1-TEAD4 interaction in gastric cancer cells. We showed that TGF-β enhanced VGLL1 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated VGLL1 functioned as a transcription cofactor of TEAD4 in NUGC3 cells. TGF-β also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in NUGC3 cells, thereby triggering the translocation of phosphorylated RSK2 to the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RSK2 phosphorylated VGLL1 at S84 in the presence of TGF-β. Mutation of VGLL1 at S84 suppressed VGLL1-TEAD4 binding and the subsequent transcriptional activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Moreover, VGLL1 peptide containing S84 suppressed the TGF-β-induced MMP9 expression and reduced the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells, whereas VGLL1 peptide containing S84A did not. Furthermore, suppression of expression or activation of VGLL1 enhances the therapeutic effects of lapatinib. Collectively, these results indicate that VGLL1 phosphorylation via TGF-β/ERK/RSK2 signaling plays a crucial role in MMP9-mediated malignancy of gastric cancer. In addition, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of the peptide containing VGLL1 S84 for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: A dimer of the heat-shock protein of 90-kDa (Hsp90) represents the critical core of the chaperone complex associated to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) oligomer. The C-terminal end of the Hsp90 dimer shapes a functional acceptor site for co-chaperones carrying tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, where they bind in a mutually exclusive and competitive manner. They impact on the biological properties of the GR•Hsp90 complex and are major players of the GR transport machinery. Recently, we showed that the overexpression of a chimeric TPR peptide influences the subcellular distribution of GR. In this study, the functional role of endogenous proteins carrying TPR or TPR-like sequences on GR subcellular distribution was characterized. It is demonstrated that, contrarily to the positive influence of FKBP52 on GR nuclear accumulation, FKBP51 and 14-3-3 impaired this property. While SGT1α showed no significant effect, the overexpression of the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP5 resulted in a nearly equal nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution of GR rather than its typical cytoplasmic localization in the absence of steroid. This observation led to analyse the influence of the phosphorylation status of GR, which resulted not linked to its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling mechanism. Nonetheless, it was evidenced that both PP5 and FKBP52 are related to the anchorage of the GR to nucleoskeleton structures. The influence of these TPR domain proteins on the steroid-dependent transcriptional activity of GR was also characterized. It is postulated that the pleiotropic actions of the GR in different cell types may be the consequence of the relative abundance of different TPR-domain interacting co-chaperones.

Abstract: P21-activated kinases 6 (PAK6) associated with many fundamental cellular processes in cancer including cell-cell adhesion, migration and apoptosis. Here, we report a novel function of PAK6 in mitosis. Expression of PAK6 peaks in the M phase. Knockdown of PAK6 increases cell number in G2/M and promotes cell proliferation. PAK6 specifically colocalizes with Eg5 in the centrosome. Depletion of PAK6 results in multipolar spindle and a simultaneous upregulation of Eg5. Further, the PAK6 depletion-induced multiple spindle and cell cycle progression is reversed by knockdown of Eg5. These data suggest that PAK6 regulates spindle formation and cell cycle by regulating Eg5 expression. Additionally, expression of PAK6 is upregulated when Eg5 is downregulated or inhibited. Thus, PAK6 and Eg5 negatively inter-regulate each other. Significantly, the effect of PAK6 expression on the outcome of the HCC patients is controlled by Eg5 expression. Inhibition of Eg5 reverses PAK6 depletion-promoted cell invasion. Collectively, our data indicate that the inter-regulation between PAK6 and Eg5 might promote the progression of HCC.

Abstract: Kti12 and PSTK are closely related and highly similar proteins implicated in different aspects of tRNA metabolism. Kti12 has been identified as an essential regulatory factor of the Elongator complex, involved in the modification of uridine bases in eukaryotic tRNAs. PSTK phosphorylates the tRNASec-bound amino acid serine, which is required to synthesize selenocysteine. Kti12 and PSTK have previously been studied independently in various organisms, but only appear simultaneously in some animalia, including humans. As Kti12- and PSTK-related pathways are clinically relevant, it is of prime importance to understand their biological functions and mutual relationship in humans. Here, we use different tRNA substrates to directly compare the enzymatic activities of purified human KTI12 and human PSTK proteins. Our complementary Co-IP and BioID2 approaches in human cells confirm that Elongator is the main interaction partner of KTI12 but additionally indicate potential links to proteins involved in vesicular transport, RNA metabolism and deubiquitination. Moreover, we identify and validate a yet uncharacterized interaction between PSTK and γ-taxilin. Foremost, we demonstrate that human KTI12 and PSTK do not share interactors or influence their respective biological functions. Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory networks controlling the activity of the human Elongator complex and selenocysteine biosynthesis.

Abstract: T cell activation starts with formation of second messengers that release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and thereby activate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), one of the essential signals for T cell activation. Recently, the steroidal 2-methoxyestradiol was shown to inhibit nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We therefore investigated 2-methoxyestradiol for inhibition of Ca2+ entry in T cells, screened a library of 2-methoxyestradiol analogues, and characterized the derivative 2-ethyl-3-sulfamoyloxy-17β-cyanomethylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (STX564) as a novel, potent and specific SOCE inhibitor. STX564 inhibits Ca2+ entry via SOCE without affecting other ion channels and pumps involved in Ca2+ signaling in T cells. Downstream effects such as cytokine expression and cell proliferation were also inhibited by both 2-methoxyestradiol and STX564, which has potential as a new chemical biology tool.

Abstract: Background
Microtubules, actin and Rho GTPase proteins are essential players in the megakaryocyte biology for platelet formation and function.
Objectives
To investigate the role of ARHGAP21, a RhoGAP protein, in megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet function.
Methods
Cytoskeletal proteins were investigated in HEL cells silenced for ARHGAP21 and submitted to megakaryocyte differentiation. The role of Arhgap21 in platelet function was accessed using haploinsufficient (Arhgap21+/−) mice. Arhgap21+/− platelet aggregation and p-selectin exposure were evaluated in response to thrombin. Vessel occlusion time and thrombus formation were detected after injury of the carotid artery. Platelet morphology was accessed by electronic microscopy.
Results
ARHGAP21 was upregulated during megakaryocytic differentiation of the cell line and primary mouse cells. In the HEL cell model, ARHGAP21 was detected in the cytoplasmic protrusions, colocalized and associated with α-tubulin and was mostly detected in the protein cell fraction containing the polymerized tubulin. Silencing of ARHGAP21 decreased the expression of Glu-tubulin, suggesting microtubule instability, and enhanced cell spreading. Platelets from Arhgap21+/− mice presented enhanced thrombin-induced aggregation and p-selectin exposure associated with increased size of α-granules. Arhgap21+/− mice also showed increased CDC42 and RHOA activities, shorter tail-bleeding and accelerated thrombus formation.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that ARHGAP21 may be a critical protein in the regulation of platelet production and function through the control of cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Abstract: Current novel drug developments for the treatment of diabetes require multiple bioanalytical assays to interrogate the cellular metabolism, which are costly, laborious and time-consuming. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a nondestructive, label-free, sensitive and low-cost technique that is recently found to be suitable for studying living cells. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that live-cell FTIR can be applied to study the differences in glucose metabolism in cells in normal culturing medium and cells treated in high glucose (a diabetes model) in order to highlight the potential of the technique in diabetes research. Live HepG2 cells were treated in normal glucose (3.8 mM; control) or high glucose (25 mM) medium and were measured directly using the FTIR approach. Principal component analysis was used to highlight any possible correlated changes 24, 48 and 72 h after treatments. FTIR spectra of live cell treated in normal and high glucose medium have shown significant differences (p < 0.05) for all treatment time. The control cells have seen an increased in the absorbance at 1088, 1240 and 1400 cm−1, which are associated with phosphate stretching mode vibrations from phosphorylated proteins and DNA back bone; and symmetric stretching mode vibration of COO- from fatty acids, amino acids, lipids and carbohydrate metabolites. However, the high glucose treated cells have shown a different changes in the 1000–1200 cm−1 region, which is linked to the glycogen and ATP:ADP ratio. In conclusion, live-cell FTIR can be a low-cost method for the studies of metabolic changes in cells.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts play a key role in maintaining homoeostasis and functionality of the skin. Their contractility plays a role in changes observed during ageing, especially in processes such as wound healing, inflammation, wrinkling and scar tissue formation as well as structural changes on extracellular matrix. Although alternations in skin physiology and morphology have been previously described, there remains a paucity of information about the influence of chronological ageing on dermal fibroblast contractility. In this study, we applied a novel nano-biomechanical technique on cell-embedded collagen hydrogels in combination with mathematical modelling and numerical simulation to measure contraction forces of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). We achieved quantitative differentiation of the contractility of cells derived from ‘young’ (< 30 years old) and ‘aged’ (> 60 years old) donors. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) was used to stimulate the fibroblasts to assess their contractile potential. NHDF from aged donors exhibited a greater basal contractile force, while in contrast, NHDF from young donors have shown a significantly larger contractile force in response to TGF-β1 treatment. These findings validate our nano-biomechanical measurement technique and provide new insights for considering NHDF contractility in regenerative medicine and as a biomarker of dermal ageing processes.

Abstract: Although a high cumulative dose of Doxorubicin (Dox) is known to cause cardiotoxicity, there is still a lack of understanding of the subcellular basis of this drug-induced cardiomyopathy. Differential effects of Dox on mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were examined in cardiomyocytes, tumor cells, implanted tumors and hearts of normal as well as tumor-bearing animals. Dox increased mitochondrial (Mito) Bax activation at 3 h in the cardiomyocyte without change in the DNA damage inducible transcriptor-3 (DDIT3) expression in the ER. Increased DDIT3 in these Dox-treated cardiomyocytes at 24 h suggested that increased MitoBax may have promoted ER stress related changes in DDIT3. Dissociation of immunoglobulin-binding protein (Bip) from activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-Bip complex in the ER was observed as an adaptive response to Dox. In contrast, breast cancer MCF7 cells showed an ER stress response to Dox with increased DDIT3 as early as 3 h which may have triggered a positive feedback activation of ATF6 at 12 and 24 h and promoted Calnexin. At these later time points, increased Bax activation in cancer cells suggested that MitoBax may be controlled by DDIT3 or by Calnexin. DDIT3 response in tumors was evoked by Dox, however this response was inversely correlated with increased Bip and Bax expression in hearts from tumor bearing animals. It is suggested that in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity both mitochondrial and ER stresses play an integral role through a mutual interaction where an inhibition of DDIT3 or Calnexin may also be crucial to achieve Dox resistance in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Microglia cells are versatile players coordinating inflammatory and regenerative processes in the central nervous system in which sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated migration is essential. We investigated the involved signaling cascade by means of voltage clamp, measurement of ATP secretion, and wound healing assay in murine microglial BV-2 cells. S1P and extracellular hypoosmolar solution evoked an anion conductance of the cell membrane. The corresponding ion currents were inhibited by intracellular hypoosmolar solution and by the anion channel antagonists NPPB, tamoxifen, and carbenoxolone, pointing to the activation of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC). The knockdown by siRNA indicates the involvement of LRRC8A subunits. The S1PR1-antagonist W123 and pertussis-toxin prevented the S1P-induced currents, showing the involvement of the Gi-protein-coupled S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). Furthermore, S1P and hypoosmolar extracellular solution induced an increase of ATP levels in the supernatants of BV-2 cells, which was inhibited by NPPB, tamoxifen, and W123. S1P, ATP, and ADP stimulated cell migration into the scratch area. The inhibition of S1PR1 and the downstream Gi proteins hampered cell migration. Antagonists of VRAC were also able to diminish the migration of BV-2 cells. Furthermore, direct inhibition of ATP-gated P2X4 or P2X7 receptors or ADP-stimulated P2Y12 receptors blocked the stimulating effects of S1P on BV-2 cell migration. We conclude that there is an interaction between S1P receptors and purinergic receptors mediated by an S1P-induced ATP release via VRAC and that the amount of released ATP is capable of stimulating cell migration of BV-2 microglia cells via activation of P2X4, P2X7, and P2Y12 receptors.

Abstract: Chemotactic and angiogenic factors secreted within the tumor microenvironment eventually facilitate the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activates secretory pathways in breast cancer cells via a mechanism driven by vesicular trafficking of this receptor. However, it remains to be elucidated how endosomal proteins in secretory vesicles are controlled by CaSR. In the present study, we demonstrate that CaSR promotes expression of Rab27B and activates this secretory small GTPase via PI3K, PKA, mTOR and MADD, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, also known as DENN/Rab3GEP. Active Rab27B leads secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, IP-10 and RANTES. Expression of Rab27B is stimulated by CaSR in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast epithelial cancer cells, but not in non-cancerous MCF-10A cells. This regulatory mechanism also occurs in HeLa and PC3 cells. Our findings provide insightful information regarding how CaSR activates a Rab27B-dependent mechanism to control secretion of factors known to intervene in paracrine communication circuits within the tumor microenvironment.
