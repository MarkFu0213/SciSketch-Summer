Abstract: Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is used by cells to control reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by mitochondria. This ability depends on the glutathionylation state of UCP2. UCP2 is often overexpressed in drug resistant cancer cells and therein controls cell ROS levels and limits drug toxicity. With our recent observation that glutathionylation deactivates proton leak through UCP2, we decided to test if diamide, a glutathionylation catalyst, can sensitize drug resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Using drug sensitive HL-60 cells and the drug resistant HL-60 subline, Mx2, we show that chemical induction of glutathionylation selectively deactivates proton leak through UCP2 in Mx2 cells. Chemical glutathionylation of UCP2 disables chemoresistance in the Mx2 cells. Exposure to 200μM diamide led to a significant increase in Mx2 cell death that was augmented when cells were exposed to either menadione or the anthracycline doxorubicin. Diamide also sensitized Mx2 cells to a number of other chemotherapeutics. Proton leak through UCP2 contributed significantly to the energetics of the Mx2 cells. Knockdown of UCP2 led to a significant decrease in both resting and state 4 (i.e., proton leak-dependent) respiration (~43% and 62%, respectively) in Mx2 cells. Similarly diamide inhibited proton leak-dependent respiration by ~64%. In contrast, diamide had very little effect on proton leak in HL-60 cells. Collectively, our observations indicate that manipulation of UCP2 glutathionylation status can serve as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Chemicals that affect cellular differentiation through epigenetic mechanisms have potential utility in treating a wide range of diseases. Hydralazine decreases DNA methylation in some cell types but its effect on differentiation has not been well explored. After five days of exposure to hydralazine, P19 embryocarcinoma cells displayed a giant cell morphology and were binucleate, indicative of a trophoblast-like morphology. Other trophoblast-like properties included the intermediary filament Troma-1/cytokeratin 8 and the transcription factor Tead4. A decrease in CpG methylation at three sites in the TEAD4 promoter and the B1 repeated sequence was observed. Knocking down expression of Tead4 with siRNA blocked the increase in Troma-1/cytokeratin 8 and over expression of Tead4 induced the expression of Troma-1/cytokeratin 8. Cells treated for 5days with hydralazine were no longer capable of undergoing retinoic acid-mediated neuronal differentiation. An irreversible loss of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 was observed following hydralazine exposure. In summary, hydralazine induces P19 cells to assume a trophoblast-like phenotype by upregulating Tead4 expression through a mechanism involving DNA demethylation.

Abstract: Previous structural studies indicated a special functional role for an acidic region composed of residues 1–10 in the unique N-terminal peptide of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Employing LC–MS/MS, we determined the presence of phosphorylation sites at S5/S6 in cTnI from wild type mouse hearts as well as in hearts of mice chronically expressing active protein kinase C-ε (PKCε) and exhibiting severe dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To determine the functional significance of these phosphorylations, we cloned and expressed wild-type cTnI, (Wt), and cTnI variants expressing pseudo-phosphorylation cTnI-(S5D), cTnI(S6D), as well as cTnI(S5A) and cTnI(S6A). We exchanged native Tn of detergent-extracted (skinned) fiber bundles with Tn reconstituted with the variant cTnIs and measured tension and cross-bridge dynamics. Compared to controls, myofilaments controlled by cTnI with pseudo-phosphorylation (S6D) or Ala substitution (S6A) demonstrated a significant depression in maximum tension, ATPase rate, and ktr, but no change in half-maximally activating Ca2+. In contrast, pseudo-phosphorylation at position 5 (S5D) had no effects, although S5A induced an increase in Ca2+-sensitivity with no change in maximum tension or ktr. We further tested the impact of acidic domain modifications on myofilament function in studies examining the effects of cTnI(A2V), a mutation linked to DCM. This mutation significantly altered the inhibitory activity of cTnI as well as cooperativity of activation of myofilament tension, but not when S23/S24 were pseudo-phosphorylated. Our data indicate a new functional and pathological role of amino acid modifications in the N-terminal acidic domain of cTnI that is modified by phosphorylations at cTnI(S23/S24).

Abstract: Lipid peroxidation plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. Aldehydes are the major end products of lipid peroxidation and can be metabolized into less reactive chemical species by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). However, ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity can be affected by many factors including reactive oxygen species. To elucidate how reactive oxygen species inhibit ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity, we stimulated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) and performed a myocardial ischemia–reperfusion model. Ox-LDL treatment and ischemia–reperfusion injury inhibited ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was activated by ox-LDL stimulation and ischemia–reperfusion injury and PARP inhibition partly restored ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity in ox-LDL treated HAECs and ischemia–reperfusion rat hearts. SIRT3 was upregulated by ox-LDL stimulation and ischemia–reperfusion injury and downregulated by PARP inhibition. Using siRNA to knock down SIRT3, we demonstrated that SIRT3 mediated deacetylation decreased ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity and PARP inhibition partly restored ALDH2 dehydrogenase activity through preventing SIRT3 expression and subsequently preserving ALDH2 acetylation.

Abstract: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a malignant intra-ocular neoplasm that affects children (usually below the age of 5years). In addition to conventional chemotherapy, novel therapeutic strategies that target metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and lipid metabolism are emerging. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a lipogenic multi-enzyme complex, is over-expressed in retinoblastoma cancer. The present study evaluated the biochemical basis of FASN inhibition induced apoptosis in cultured Y79 RB cells. FASN inhibitors (cerulenin, triclosan and orlistat) significantly inhibited FASN enzyme activity (P<0.05) in Y79 RB cells. This was accompanied by a decrease in palmitate synthesis (end-product depletion), and increased malonyl CoA levels (substrate accumulation). Differential lipid profile was biochemically estimated in neoplastic (Y79 RB) and non-neoplastic (3T3) cells subjected to FASN inhibition. The relative proportion of phosphatidyl choline to neutral lipids (triglyceride+total cholesterol) in Y79 RB cancer cells was found to be higher than the non-neoplastic cells, indicative of altered lipid distribution and utilization in tumor cells. FASN inhibitor treated Y79 RB and fibroblast cells showed decrease in the cellular lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol and phosphatidyl choline) levels. Apoptotic DNA damage induced by FASN inhibitors was accompanied by enhanced lipid peroxidation.

Mechanism of capsaicin receptor TRPV1-mediated toxicity in pain-sensing neurons focusing on the effects of Na+/Ca2+ fluxes and the Ca2+-binding protein calretinin,

Abstract: Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) receptor is a pain-sensing, ligand-gated, non-selective cation channel expressed in peripheral sensory neurons. Prolonged activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin leads to cell swelling and formation of membrane blebs in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells stably expressing TRPV1. Here, we assessed the contribution of Ca2+ and Na+ ions to TRPV1-mediated changes. Cell swelling was caused by a substantial influx of extracellular Na+ via TRPV1 channels, causing concomitant transport of water. In the absence of extracellular Na+, the membrane blebbing was completely inhibited, but Ca2+ influx did not change under these conditions. Na+ influx was modulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin sensitized/activated TRPV1 channels causing cell swelling in TRPV1-positive cells. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, capsaicin caused only little increase in [Ca2+]i indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i observed after capsaicin application is derived essentially from extracellular Ca2+ and not from internal Ca2+ stores. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ also the process of cell swelling was considerably slower. Calretinin is a Ca2+ buffer protein, which is expressed in a subset of TRPV1-positive neurons. Calretinin decreased the amplitude, but slowed down the decay of Ca2+ signals evoked by ionomycin. Cells co-expressing TRPV1 and calretinin were less sensitive to TRPV1-mediated, capsaicin-induced volume increases. In TRPV1-expressing NIH3T3 cells, calretinin decreased the capsaicin-induced Ca2+ and Na+ influx. Swelling and formation of membrane blebs resulted in impaired plasma membrane integrity finally leading to cell death. Our results hint towards a mechanistic explanation for the apoptosis-independent capsaicin-evoked neuronal loss and additionally reveal a protective effect of calretinin; we propose that the Ca2+-buffering capacity of calretinin reduces the susceptibility of calretinin-expressing DRG neurons against cell swelling/death caused by overstimulation of TRPV1 channels.

The sirtuin inhibitor cambinol impairs MAPK signaling, inhibits inflammatory and innate immune responses and protects from septic shock,

Abstract: Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) that play an important role in the control of metabolism and proliferation and the development of age-associated diseases like oncologic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Cambinol was originally described as a compound inhibiting the activity of SIRT1 and SIRT2, with efficient anti-tumor activity in vivo. Here, we studied the effects of cambinol on microbial sensing by mouse and human immune cells and on host innate immune responses in vivo. Cambinol inhibited the expression of cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, and IFN-γ), NO and CD40 by macrophages, dendritic cells, splenocytes and whole blood stimulated with a broad range of microbial and inflammasome stimuli. Sirtinol, an inhibitor of SIRT1 and SIRT2 structurally related to cambinol, also decreased macrophage response to TLR stimulation. On the contrary, selective inhibitors of SIRT1 (EX-527 and CHIC-35) and SIRT2 (AGK2 and AK-7) used alone or in combination had no inhibitory effect, suggesting that cambinol and sirtinol act by targeting more than just SIRT1 and SIRT2. Cambinol and sirtinol at anti-inflammatory concentrations also did not inhibit SIRT6 activity in in vitro assay. At the molecular level, cambinol impaired stimulus-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs and upstream MEKs. Going well along with its powerful anti-inflammatory activity, cambinol reduced TNF blood levels and bacteremia and improved survival in preclinical models of endotoxic shock and septic shock. Altogether, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibitors of sirtuins structurally related to cambinol may be of clinical interest to treat inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Diastolic dysfunction is characterized by slow or incomplete relaxation of the ventricles during diastole, and is an important contributor to heart failure pathophysiology. Clinical symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, all contributing to decreased quality of life and poor prognosis. There are currently no therapies available that directly target the heart pump defects in diastolic function. Calcium mishandling is a hallmark of heart disease and has been the subject of a large body of research. Efforts are ongoing in a number of gene therapy approaches to normalize the function of calcium handling proteins such as sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. An alternative approach to address calcium mishandling in diastolic dysfunction is to introduce calcium buffers to facilitate relaxation of the heart. Parvalbumin is a calcium binding protein found in fast-twitch skeletal muscle and not normally expressed in the heart. Gene transfer of parvalbumin into normal and diseased cardiac myocytes increases relaxation rate but also markedly decreases contraction amplitude. Although parvalbumin binds calcium in a delayed manner, it is not delayed enough to preserve full contractility. Factors contributing to the temporal nature of calcium buffering by parvalbumin are discussed in relation to remediation of diastolic dysfunction. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte Biology: Cardiac Pathways of Differentiation, Metabolism and Contraction.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma cell lines are heterogeneous, comprised of at least three distinct cell phenotypes; neuroblastic N-type cells, non-neuronal substrate-adherent S-type cells and intermediate I-type cells. N- and S-type cell populations were enriched from the parental SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and induced to differentiate by the addition of retinoic acid (RA), a drug used in the treatment of neuroblastoma. N- and S-type cells were identified based on their differential expression of β-tubulin III, vimentin and Bcl-2. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) was then measured in proliferating and differentiated N- and S-type cell populations and the expression of STIM1, Orai1 and TRPC1, three proteins reported to play a key role in SOCE, was determined. In N-type cells the RA-induced switch from proliferation to differentiation was accompanied by a down-regulation in SOCE. STIM1 and Orai1 expression became down-regulated in differentiated cells, consistent with their respective roles as ER Ca2+ sensor and store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC). TRPC1 became up-regulated suggesting that TRPC1 is not involved in SOCE, at least in differentiated N-type cells. In S-type cells SOCE remained active following the RA-induced switch from proliferation to differentiation and the expression of STIM1 and Orai1 remained unchanged. TRPC1 was not expressed in S-type cells. Our results indicate that differentiation of neuronal cells is associated with a remodelling of SOCE. Therapeutic targeting of SOCE proteins could potentially be a means of promoting neuronal differentiation in the treatment of neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Previously, we showed an inverse correlation between HSP27 serum levels and experimental atherogenesis in ApoE−/− mice that over-express HSP27 and speculated that the apparent binding of HSP27 to scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) was of mechanistic importance in attenuating foam cell formation. However, the nature and importance of the interplay between HSP27 and SR-A in atheroprotection remained unclear. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) inhibited acLDL binding (−34%; p<0.005) and uptake (−38%, p<0.05). rHSP27 reduced SR-A mRNA (−39%, p=0.02), total protein (−56%, p=0.01) and cell surface (−53%, p<0.001) expression. The reduction in SR-A expression by rHSP27 was associated with a 4-fold increase in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling (p<0.001 versus control), while an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, BAY11-7082, attenuated the negative effects of rHSP27 on both SR-A expression and lipid uptake. To determine if SR-A is required for HSP27 mediated atheroprotection in vivo, ApoE−/− and ApoE−/− SR-A−/− mice fed with a high fat diet were treated for 3weeks with rHSP25. Compared to controls, rHSP25 therapy reduced aortic en face and aortic sinus atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE−/− mice by 39% and 36% (p<0.05), respectively, but not in ApoE−/−SR-A−/− mice. In conclusion, rHSP27 diminishes SR-A expression, resulting in attenuated foam cell formation in vitro. Regulation of SR-A by HSP27 may involve the participation of NF-κB signaling. Lastly, SR-A is required for HSP27-mediated atheroprotection in vivo.

Abstract: Endocytosis of activated growth factor receptors regulates spatio-temporal cellular signaling. In the case of the EGF receptor, sorting into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) controls signal termination and subsequently leads to receptor degradation in lysosomes. Annexin A1, a Ca2+-regulated membrane binding protein often deregulated in human cancers, interacts with the EGF receptor and is phosphorylated by internalized EGF receptor on endosomes. Most relevant for EGF receptor signal termination, annexin A1 is required for the formation of internal vesicles in MVBs that sequester ligand-bound EGF receptor away from the limiting membrane. To elucidate the mechanism underlying annexin A1-dependent EGF receptor trafficking we employed an N-terminally truncated annexin A1 mutant that lacks the EGF receptor phosphorylation site and the site for interaction with its protein ligand S100A11. Overexpression of this dominant-negative mutant induces a delay in EGF-induced EGF receptor transport to the LAMP1-positive late endosomal/lysosomal compartment and impairs ligand-induced EGF receptor degradation. Consistent with these findings, EGF-stimulated EGF receptor and MAP kinase pathway signaling is prolonged. Importantly, depletion of S100A11 also results in a delayed EGF receptor transport and prolonged MAP kinase signaling comparable to the trafficking defect observed in cells expressing the N-terminally truncated annexin A1 mutant. These results strongly suggest that the function of annexin A1 as a regulator of EGF receptor trafficking, degradation and signaling is critically mediated through an N-terminal interaction with S100A11 in the endosomal compartment. This interaction appears to be essential for lysosomal targeting of the EGF receptor, possibly by providing a physical scaffold supporting inward vesiculation in MVBs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: Eukaryotes store lipids in a specialised organelle, the lipid body (LB), mainly as triglycerides (TAGs). Both the rates of synthesis and degradation contribute to the control of the accumulation of TAGs. The synthesis of TAGs in yeasts has been well documented, especially in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. However, descriptions of the processes involved in TAG degradation are more scarce and mostly for S. cerevisiae. Here, we report the characterisation of two Y. lipolytica genes, YlTGL3 and YlTGL4, encoding intracellular lipases involved in TAG degradation. The two proteins are localised in lipid bodies, and YlTgl4 was mainly found at the interface between LBs. Surprisingly, the spatial organisation of YlTgl3 and YlTgl4 depends on the culture medium and on the physiological phase of the cell. Inactivation of one or both genes doubles the lipid accumulation capacity of Y. lipolytica, increasing the cell's capacity to accumulate TAGs. The amino acid sequence of YlTgl4 contains the consensus sequence motif (G/A)XSXG, typical of serine hydrolases, whereas YlTgl3 does not. Single and double mutants are unable to degrade TAGs, and higher expression of YlTgl4 correlates with TAG degradation. Therefore, we propose that YlTgl4 is the main lipase responsible for TAG degradation and that YlTgl3 may act as a positive regulator of YlTgl4 rather than a functional lipase. Thus, contrary to S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica possesses two intracellular lipases with distinct roles and with distinct localisations in the LB.

Abstract: The 53-kDa insulin receptor substrate protein (IRSp53) organizes the actin cytoskeleton in response to stimulation of small GTPases, promoting the formation of cell protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. IMD is the N-terminal 250 amino acid domain (IRSp53/MIM Homology Domain) of IRSp53 (also called I-BAR), which can bind to negatively charged lipid molecules. Overexpression of IMD induces filopodia formation in cells and purified IMD assembles finger-like protrusions in reconstituted lipid membranes. IMD was shown by several groups to bundle actin filaments, but other groups showed that it also binds to membranes. IMD binds to negatively charged lipid molecules with preference to clusters of PI(4,5)P2. Here, we performed a range of different in vitro fluorescence experiments to determine the binding properties of the IMD to phospholipids. We used different constructs of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVETs), containing neutral or negatively charged phospholipids. We found that IMD has a stronger binding interaction with negatively charged PI(4,5)P2 or PS lipids than PS/PC or neutral PC lipids. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the IMD–lipid interaction falls into the 78–170μM range for all the lipids tested. The solvent accessibility of the fluorescence labels on the IMD during its binding to lipids is also reduced as the lipids become more negatively charged. Actin affects the IMD–lipid interaction, depending on its polymerization state. Monomeric actin partially disrupts the binding, while filamentous actin can further stabilize the IMD–lipid interaction.

Abstract: Background
Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is critically required for the induction of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM), a model of post-inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy. Its specific role in the progression of myocarditis into end stage heart failure is not known.
Methods and results
BALB/c mice were immunized with myosin peptide and complete Freund's adjuvant at days 0 and 7. Heart-infiltrating inflammatory CD133+ progenitors were isolated from inflamed hearts at the peak of inflammation (day 21). In the presence of GM-CSF, inflammatory CD133+ progenitors up-regulated integrin, alpha X (CD11c), class II major histocompatibility complex, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules reflecting an inflammatory dendritic cell (DC) phenotype. Inflammatory DCs stimulated antigen-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation and induced myocarditis after myosin peptide loading and adoptive transfer in healthy mice. Moreover, GM-CSF treatment of mice after the peak of disease, between days 21 and 29 of EAM, transiently increased accumulation of inflammatory DCs in the myocardium. Importantly, bone marrow-derived CD11b+ monocytes, rather than inflammatory CD133+ progenitors represent the dominant cellular source of heart-infiltrating inflammatory DCs in EAM. In contrast, GM-CSF treatment neither affected numbers of heart-infiltrating CD45+ and CD3+ T cells nor the development of post-inflammatory fibrosis.
Conclusions
GM-CSF treatment promotes formation of inflammatory DCs in EAM. In contrast to the active roles of GM-CSF and DCs in EAM induction, GM-CSF-induced inflammatory DCs neither prevent resolution of active inflammation, nor contribute to post-inflammatory cardiac remodelling.

Abstract: Cardiac oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Systemic deletion of the gene encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a phenotype characterized by severe steatotic cardiac dysfunction. The objective of the present study was to investigate a potential role of oxidative stress in cardiac ATGL deficiency. Hearts of mice with global ATGL knockout were compared to those of mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL and to those of wildtype littermates. Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress, measured as lucigenin chemiluminescence, was increased ~6-fold in ATGL-deficient hearts. In parallel, cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits p67phox and p47phox were upregulated 4–5-fold at the protein level. Moreover, a prominent upregulation of different inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor α, monocyte chemotactant protein-1, interleukin 6, and galectin-3) was observed in those hearts. Both the oxidative and inflammatory responses were abolished upon cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL. Investigating the effect of oxidative and inflammatory stress on nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction we observed a ~2.5-fold upregulation of soluble guanylate cyclase activity and a ~2-fold increase in cardiac tetrahydrobiopterin levels. Systemic treatment of ATGL-deficient mice with the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin did not ameliorate but rather aggravated cardiac oxidative stress. Our data suggest that oxidative and inflammatory stress seems involved in lipotoxic heart disease. Upregulation of soluble guanylate cyclase and cardiac tetrahydrobiopterin might be regarded as counterregulatory mechanisms in cardiac ATGL deficiency.

p38α phosphorylates serine 258 within the cytoplasmic domain of tissue factor and prevents its incorporation into cell-derived microparticles,

Abstract: We previously showed that the phosphorylation of Ser253 within the cytoplasmic domain of human tissue factor (TF) initiates the incorporation and release of this protein into cell-derived microparticles. Furthermore, subsequent phosphorylation of Ser258 terminates this process. However, the identity of the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser258 and mode of action of this enzyme remain unknown. In this study, p38α was identified as the proline-directed kinase capable of phosphorylating Ser258 specifically, and without any detectable activity towards Ser253. Furthermore, using synthetic peptides, it was shown that the Km for the reaction decreased by approximately 10 fold on substitution of Ser253 with phospho-Ser253. Either inhibition of p38 using SB202190 or knockdown of p38α expression in coronary artery endothelial cells overexpressing wild-type TF, resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Ser258, following activation of cells with PAR2-agonist peptide (PAR2-AP). In agreement with our previous data, inhibition of phosphorylation of this residue maintained the release of TF. Activation of PAR2 in cells transfected to overexpress TF, resulted in two separate peaks of p38 activity at approximately 40 and 120min post-activation. Furthermore, overexpression of Ala253-substituted TF enhanced the second p38 activation peak. However, the second peak was absent in cells devoid of TF or in cells overexpressing the Asp253-substituted TF. Our data clearly identifies p38α as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Ser258 within the cytoplasmic domain of TF. Moreover, it appears that the presence of TF within the cells regulates the late activation of p38 and consequently the termination of TF release into microparticles.

Transferrin iron uptake is stimulated by ascorbate via an intracellular reductive mechanism,

Abstract: Although ascorbate has long been known to stimulate dietary iron (Fe) absorption and non-transferrin Fe uptake, the role of ascorbate in transferrin Fe uptake is unknown. Transferrin is a serum Fe transport protein supplying almost all cellular Fe under physiological conditions. We sought to examine ascorbate's role in this process, particularly as cultured cells are typically ascorbate-deficient. At typical plasma concentrations, ascorbate significantly increased 59Fe uptake from transferrin by 1.5–2-fold in a range of cells. Moreover, ascorbate enhanced ferritin expression and increased 59Fe accumulation in ferritin. The lack of effect of cycloheximide or the cytosolic aconitase inhibitor, oxalomalate, on ascorbate-mediated 59Fe uptake from transferrin indicate increased ferritin synthesis or cytosolic aconitase activity was not responsible for ascorbate's activity. Experiments with membrane-permeant and -impermeant ascorbate-oxidizing reagents indicate that while extracellular ascorbate is required for stimulation of 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-citrate, only intracellular ascorbate is needed for transferrin 59Fe uptake. Additionally, experiments with l-ascorbate analogs indicate ascorbate's reducing ene-diol moiety is necessary for its stimulatory activity. Importantly, neither N-acetylcysteine nor buthionine sulfoximine, which increase or decrease intracellular glutathione, respectively, affected transferrin-dependent 59Fe uptake. Thus, ascorbate's stimulatory effect is not due to a general increase in cellular reducing capacity. Ascorbate also did not affect expression of transferrin receptor 1 or 125I-transferrin cellular flux. However, transferrin receptors, endocytosis, vacuolar-type ATPase activity and endosomal acidification were required for ascorbate's stimulatory activity. Therefore, ascorbate is a novel modulator of the classical transferrin Fe uptake pathway, acting via an intracellular reductive mechanism.

Phosphorylation and nitration of tyrosine residues affect functional properties of Synaptophysin and Dynamin I, two proteins involved in exo-endocytosis of synaptic vesicles,

Abstract: Phosphorylation and nitration of protein tyrosine residues are thought to play a role in signaling pathways at the nerve terminal and to affect functional properties of proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle (SV) exo-endocytotic cycle. We previously demonstrated that the tyrosine residues in the C-terminal domain of the SV protein Synaptophysin (SYP) are targets of peroxynitrite (PN). Here, we have characterized the association between SYP and c-src tyrosine kinase demonstrating that phosphorylation of Tyr273 in the C-terminal domain of SYP is crucial in mediating SYP binding to and activation of c-src. SYP forms a complex with Dynamin I (DynI), a GTPase required for SV endocytosis, which may be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of SYP. We here report that, in rat brain synaptosomes treated with PN, the formation of SYP/DynI complex was impaired. Noteworthy, we found that DynI was also modified by PN. DynI tyrosine phosphorylation was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner, while DynI tyrosine nitration increased. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified Tyr354 as one nitration site in DynI. In addition, we tested DynI self-assembly and GTPase activity, which are enhanced by c-src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of DynI, and found that both were inhibited by PN. Our results suggest that the site-specific tyrosine residue modifications may modulate the association properties of SV proteins and serve as a regulator of DynI function via control of self-assembly, thus influencing the physiology of the exo-endocytotic cycle.

Abstract: Protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) contributes to multiple signaling pathways affecting human disease. The function of PKCε requires it to undergo changes in subcellular distribution in response to signaling events. While the mechanisms underlying this translocation are incompletely understood, it involves the receptor for activated C kinase protein (RACK2/β′-COP). This receptor also functions as a vesicle coat protein in the secretory pathway where it is regulated by the small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor, ARF1. We inhibited ARF1 activation to test the requirement for RACK2/β′-COP in PKCε localization in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We found that steady-state localization of PKCε at the Golgi complex requires ARF1-regulated RACK2/β′-COP function. By contrast, we did not observe any defects in phorbol ester-induced translocation when ARF1 was inhibited. We also found that PKCε bound to isolated membranes through two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism was dependent upon RACK2/β′-COP while a second was RACK2/β′-COP-independent and stimulated by phorbol esters. Finally, we show that RACK2/β′-COP affects the subcellular distribution of a constitutively active form of PKCε, in a manner similar to what we observed for wild-type PKCε. Together, our data support a role for RACK2/β′-COP in the steady-state localization of PKCε at the Golgi apparatus, which may be independent of its role during PKCε translocation to the cell surface.

Abstract: Regulation of nuclear protein import is central to many cellular processes such as development, with a key mechanism being factors that retain cargoes in the cytoplasm that normally localize in the nucleus. The breast cancer antigen BRCA1-binding protein BRAP2 has been reported as a novel negative regulator of nuclear import of various nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing viral and cellular proteins, but although implicated in differentiation pathways and highly expressed in tissues including testis, the gamut of targets for BRAP2 action in a developmental context is unknown. As a first step towards defining the BRAP2 interactome, we performed a yeast-2-hybrid screen to identify binding partners of BRAP2 in human testis. Here we report characterization for the first time of three of these: the high mobility group (HMG)-box-domain-containing chromatin component HMG20A, nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA1 and synaptic nuclear envelope protein SYNE2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate association of BRAP2 with HMG20A, NuMA1, and SYNE2 in testis, underlining the physiological relevance of the interactions, with immunohistochemistry showing that where BRAP2 is co-expressed with HMG20A and NuMA1, both are present in the cytoplasm, in contrast to their nuclear localization in other testicular cell types. Importantly, quantitative confocal microscopic analysis of cultured cells indicates that ectopic expression of BRAP2 inhibits nuclear localization of HMG20A and NuMA1, and prevents nuclear envelope accumulation of SYNE2, the first report of BRAP2 altering localization of a non-nuclear protein. These results imply for the first time that BRAP2 may have an important role in modulating subcellular localization during testicular development.

Abstract: The magnitude of length dependent activation in striated muscle has been shown to vary with titin isoform. Recently, a rat that harbors a homozygous autosomal mutation (HM) causing preferential expression of a longer, giant titin isoform was discovered (Greaser et al. 2005). Here, we investigated the impact of titin isoform on myofilament force development and cross-bridge cycling kinetics as function of sarcomere length (SL) in tibialis anterior skeletal muscle isolated from wild type (WT) and HM. Skeletal muscle bundles from HM rats exhibited reductions in passive tension, maximal force development, myofilament calcium sensitivity, maximal ATP consumption, and tension cost at both short and long sarcomere length (SL=2.8μm and SL=3.2μm, respectively). Moreover, the SL-dependent changes in these parameters were attenuated in HM muscles. Additionally, myofilament Ca2+ activation–relaxation properties were assessed in single isolated myofibrils. Both the rate of tension generation upon Ca2+ activation (kACT) as well as the rate of tension redevelopment following a length perturbation (kTR) were reduced in HM myofibrils compared to WT, while relaxation kinetics were not affected. We conclude that presence of a long isoform of titin in the striated muscle sarcomere is associated with reduced myofilament force development and cross-bridge cycling kinetics, and a blunting of myofilament length dependent activation.

Abstract: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by cognitive and motor decline, epilepsy, visual loss and by lysosomal autofluorescent inclusions. Two distinct clinical phenotypes, the progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR) and a late-infantile variant of NCLs (CLN8-vLINCL) are associated with mutations in the CLN8 gene that encodes a transmembrane protein predominantly located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To gain insight into the function of CLN8 protein, we employed the split-ubiquitin membrane-based yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system, which detects protein-protein interactions in a membrane environment, using the full-length human CLN8 as bait and a human brain cDNA library as prey. We identified several potential protein partners of CLN8 and especially referred to VAPA, c14orf1/hERG28, STX8, GATE16, BNIP3 and BNIP3L proteins that are associated with biologically relevant processes such as synthesis and transport of lipids, vesicular/membrane trafficking, autophagy/mitophagy and apoptosis. Interactions of CLN8 with VAPA and GATE16 were further validated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays in mammalian cells. Using a new C-terminal-oriented CLN8 antibody, CLN8-VAPA interaction was also confirmed by co-staining in close spatial proximity within different CNS tissues. The results of this study shed light on potential interactome networks of CLN8 and provide a powerful starting point for understanding protein function(s) and molecular aspects of diseases associated with CLN8 deficiency.

Abstract: Hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL) are negative regulators of plasma HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels and presumably could affect two main HDL atheroprotective functions, macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and HDL antioxidant properties. In this study, we assessed the effects of both HL and EL deficiency on macrophage-specific RCT process and HDL ability to protect against LDL oxidation. HL- and EL-deficient and wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]cholesterol-labeled mouse macrophages, after which the appearance of [3H]cholesterol in plasma, liver, and feces was determined. The degree of HDL oxidation and the protection of oxidative modification of LDL co-incubated with HDL were evaluated by measuring conjugated diene kinetics. Plasma levels of HDLc, HDL phospholipids, apoA-I, and platelet-activated factor acetyl-hydrolase were increased in both HL- and EL-deficient mice. These genetically modified mice displayed increased levels of radiolabeled, HDL-bound [3H]cholesterol 48h after the label injection. The magnitude of macrophage-derived [3H]cholesterol in feces was also increased in both the HL- and EL-deficient mice. HDL from the HL- and EL-deficient mice was less prone to oxidation and had a higher ability to protect LDL from oxidation, compared with the HDL derived from the wild-type mice. These changes were correlated with plasma apoA-I and apoA-I/HDL total protein levels. In conclusion, targeted inactivation of both HL and EL in mice promoted macrophage-to-feces RCT and enhanced HDL antioxidant properties.

Abstract: Tannic acid is a hydrolyzable tannin that exists in many widespread edible plants with a variety of biological activities. In this study, we found that tannic acid potently inhibited the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-inhibitory concentration value (IC50) of 0.14μM. The inhibition kinetic results showed that the inhibition of FAS by tannic acid was mixed competitive and noncompetitive manner with respect to acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, but uncompetitive to NADPH. Tannic acid prevented the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, and thus repressed intracellular lipid accumulation. In the meantime, tannic acid decreased the expression of FAS and down-regulated the mRNA level of FAS and PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation. Further studies showed that the inhibitory effect of tannic acid did not relate to FAS non-specific sedimentation. Since FAS was believed to be a therapeutic target of obesity, these findings suggested that tannic acid was considered having potential in the prevention of obesity.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly occurring malignancies in men, and because existing treatments are not able to manage this neoplasm adequately, novel approaches are needed. Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has strong antitumor activity via the induction of apoptotic cell death in a wide range of tumor cell types and has negligible toxicity to most normal cells, some prostate carcinoma cells are resistant to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Therefore, combinatorial approaches with TRAIL and different chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL. Here, we investigated the sensitizing effects of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in many plants, on TRAIL-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. We found TRAIL-induced prostate cancer cells apoptosis was significantly enhanced by UA, and that UA induced CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation. This study shows the use of UA as a sensitizer for TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death offers a promising means of enhancing the efficacy of TRAIL-based prostate cancer treatments.

Characterisation of the prostaglandin E2-ethanolamide suppression of tumour necrosis factor-α production in human monocytic cells,

Abstract: Background and purpose
Prostaglandin ethanolamides or prostamides are naturally occurring neutral lipid derivatives of prostaglandins that have been shown to be synthesised in vivo following COX-facilitated oxygenation of arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide). Although the actions of prostaglandins have been extensively studied, little is known about the physiological or pathophysiological effects of prostamides. Since prostaglandin E2 has potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulating actions, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the derivative, prostaglandin E2 ethanolamide (PGE2-EA), could modulate the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α in human blood and human monocytic cells and indicate whether this action involved the same receptor systems/signals as PGE2.
Experimental approach
Whole human blood, monocytes isolated from the blood or the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was incubated with LPS and the level of TNF-α produced was measured by ELISA assay. The actions of PGE2-EA were assessed on the LPS-induced TNF-α release. In addition, in order to ascertain the receptors involved, the levels of cyclic AMP in cells were measured in monocytes and THP-1 cells in response to PGE2-EA and directly compared to those of PGE2. The effect of PGE2-EA on the binding of radiolabelled PGE2 to cells was also measured. Cells were incubated with radiolabelled arachidonic acid and ethanolamine to estimate the production of PGE2-EA.
Key results
PGE2-EA potently suppressed TNF-α production in blood, monocytes and the cell line THP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. This occurred via cyclic AMP pathways as indicated by agents which interfere with these pathways and also direct ligand binding experiments. It was also shown that the cells were able to endogenously produce PGE2-EA.
Conclusions and implications
This study reports that PGE2-EA can downregulate the production of TNF-α by human mononuclear cells in response to an immune stimulus, i.e. LPS-activated TLR4, and that this appears to occur via a cAMP-dependent mechanism that most likely involves binding to the EP2 receptor.

Abstract: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a key regulator of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, induces HDL remodeling by transferring lipids between apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins and HDL, and/or by promoting lipid transfer between HDL subparticles. In this study, we investigated the mechanism as to how CETP induces the generation of lipid-poor particles (pre-β-HDL) from HDL, which increases ATP-binding cassette transporter 1-mediated cholesterol efflux. This CETP-dependent HDL remodeling is enhanced by the CETP modulator dalcetrapib both in plasma and isolated HDL. The interaction of dalcetrapib with cysteine 13 of CETP is required, since this effect was abolished when using mutant CETP in which cysteine 13 was substituted for a serine residue. Other thiol-containing compounds were identified as CETP modulators interacting with cysteine 13 of CETP. In order to mimic dalcetrapib-bound CETP, mutant CETP proteins were prepared by replacing cysteine 13 with the bulky amino acid tyrosine or tryptophan. The resultant mutants showed virtually no CETP-dependent lipid transfer activity but demonstrated preserved CETP-dependent pre-β-HDL generation. Overall, these data demonstrate that the two functions of CETP i.e., cholesteryl ester transfer and HDL remodeling can be uncoupled by interaction of thiol-containing compounds with cysteine 13 of CETP or by introducing large amino acid residues in place of cysteine 13.

Abstract: Retinoids (vitamin A and its metabolites) are essential micronutrients that regulate many cellular processes. Greater than 70% of the body's retinoid reserves are stored in the liver as retinyl ester (RE). Chronic alcohol consumption induces depletion of hepatic retinoid stores, and the extent of this has been correlated with advancing stages of alcoholic liver disease. The goal of this study was to analyze the mechanisms responsible for depletion of hepatic RE stores by alcohol consumption. A change in the fatty-acyl composition of RE in alcohol-fed mice was observed within two weeks after the start of alcohol consumption. Specifically, alcohol-feeding was associated with a significant decline in hepatic retinyl palmitate levels; however, total RE levels were maintained by a compensatory increase in levels of usually minor RE species, particularly retinyl oleate. Our data suggests that alcohol feeding initially stimulates a futile cycle of RE hydrolysis and synthesis, and that the change in RE acyl composition is associated with a change in the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. The alcohol-induced change in RE acyl composition was specific to the liver, and was not seen in lung or white adipose tissue. This shift in hepatic RE fatty acyl composition is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and may be an early biomarker for events associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) gene knockout impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells (mESC). Here, various chemical compounds able to enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation in mESC [including dimethylsulfoxide, ascorbic acid (vitC), free radicals and reactive oxygen species] were tested for their ability to rescue the cardiomyogenic potential of Fgfr1−/− mESC. Among them, only the reduced form of vitC, l-ascorbic acid, was able to recover beating cell differentiation in Fgfr1−/− mESC. The appearance of contracting cells was paralleled by the expression of early and late cardiac gene markers, thus suggesting their identity as cardiomyocytes. In the attempt to elucidate the mechanism of action of vitC on Fgfr1−/− mESC, we analyzed several parameters related to the intracellular redox state, such as reactive oxygen species content, Nox4 expression, and superoxide dismutase activity. The results did not show any relationship between the antioxidant capacity of vitC and cardiomyocyte differentiation in Fgfr1−/− mESC. No correlation was found also for the ability of vitC to modulate the expression of pluripotency genes. Then, we tested the hypothesis that vitC was acting as a prolyl hydroxylase cofactor by maintaining iron in a reduced state. We first analyze hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α mRNA and protein levels that were found to be slightly upregulated in Fgfr1−/− cells. We treated mESC with Fe2+ or the HIF inhibitor CAY10585 during the first phases of the differentiation process and, similar to vitC, the two compounds were able to rescue cardiomyocyte formation in Fgfr1−/− mESC, thus implicating HIF-1α modulation in Fgfr1-dependent cardiomyogenesis.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a network of signaling pathways that responds to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The general output of the UPR is to upregulate genes involved in ER function, thus restoring and/or increasing the capacity of the ER to fold and process proteins. In parallel, many organisms have mechanisms for limiting the load on the ER by attenuating translation or degrading ER-targeted mRNAs. Despite broad conservation of these signaling pathways across eukaryotes, interesting variations demonstrate a variety of mechanisms for managing ER stress. How do early-diverging protozoa respond to stress when they lack traditional transcriptional regulation? What is the role of the ER stress sensor Ire1 in fungal species that are missing its main target? Here I describe how diverse species have optimized the UPR to fit their needs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: Apoptotic signaling plays an important role in skeletal muscle degradation, atrophy, and dysfunction. Mitochondria are central executers of apoptosis by directly participating in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death signaling. Given the important apoptotic role of mitochondria, altering mitochondrial content could influence apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the direct effect of modest, but physiological increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and content on skeletal muscle apoptosis using a cell culture approach. Treatment of L6 myoblasts with SNAP or AICAR (5h/day for 5days) significantly increased PGC-1, AIF, cytochrome c, and MnSOD protein content as well as MitoTracker staining. Following induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, L6 myoblasts displayed decreased sensitivity to apoptotic cell death as well as reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation following exposure to staurosporine (STS) and C2-ceramide. L6 myoblasts with higher mitochondrial content also exhibited reduced apoptosis and AIF release following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Analysis of several key apoptosis regulatory proteins (ARC, Bax, Bcl-2, XIAP), antioxidant proteins (catalase, MnSOD, CuZnSOD), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) measures (DCF and MitoSOX fluorescence) revealed that these mechanisms were not responsible for the observed cellular protection. However, myoblasts with higher mitochondrial content were less sensitive to Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation (mPTP) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Collectively, these data demonstrate that increased mitochondrial content at physiological levels provides protection against apoptotic cell death by decreasing caspase-dependent and caspase-independent signaling through influencing mitochondrial Ca2+-mediated apoptotic events. Therefore, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis/content may represent a potential therapeutic approach in skeletal muscle disorders displaying increased apoptosis.

Abstract: Osmotic stress poses one of the most fundamental challenges to living cells. Particularly, the largely inextensible plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells easily ruptures under in-plane tension calling for sophisticated strategies to readily respond to osmotic stress. We describe how epithelial cells react and adapt mechanically to the exposure to hypotonic and hypertonic solutions in the context of a confluent monolayer. Site-specific indentation experiments in conjunction with tether pulling on individual cells have been carried out with an atomic force microscope to reveal spatio-temporal changes in membrane tension and surface area. We found that cells compensate for an increase in lateral tension due to hypoosmotic stress by sacrificing excess of membrane area stored in protrusions and invaginations such as microvilli and caveolae. At mild hypotonic conditions lateral tension increases partly compensated by surface are regulation, i.e. the cell sacrifices some of its membrane reservoirs. A loss of membrane–actin contacts occurs upon exposure to stronger hypotonic solutions giving rise to a drop in lateral tension. Tension release recovers on longer time scales by an increasing endocytosis, which efficiently removes excess membrane from the apical side to restore the initial pre-stress. Hypertonic solutions lead to shrinkage of cells and collapse of the apical membrane onto the cortex. Exposure to distilled water leads to stiffening of cells due to removal of excess surface area and tension increase due to elevated osmotic pressure across the plasma membrane.

Abstract: How dietary fatty acids are absorbed into the enterocyte and transported to the ER is not established. We tested the possibility that caveolin-1 containing lipid rafts and endocytic vesicles were involved. Apical brush border membranes took up 15% of albumin bound 3H-oleate whereas brush border membranes from caveolin-1 KO mice took up only 1%. In brush border membranes, the 3H-oleate was in the detergent resistant fraction of an OptiPrep gradient. On OptiPrep gradients of intestinal cytosol, we also found the 3H-oleate in the detergent resistant fraction, separate from OptiPrep gradients spiked with 3H-oleate or 3H-triacylglycerol. Caveolin-1 immuno-depletion of cytosol removed 91% of absorbed 3H-oleate whereas immuno-depletion using IgG, or anti-caveolin-2 or -3 or anti-clathrin antibodies removed 20%. Electron microscopy showed the presence of caveolin-1 containing vesicles in WT mouse cytosol that were 4 fold increased by feeding intestinal sacs 1mM oleate. No vesicles were seen in caveolin-1 KO mouse cytosol. Caveolin-1 KO mice gained less weight on a 23% fat diet and had increased fat in their stool compared to WT mice. We conclude that dietary fatty acids are absorbed by caveolae in enterocyte brush border membranes, are endocytosed, and transported in cytosol in caveolin-1 containing endocytic vesicles.

Inhibition of ERK activation enhances the repair of double-stranded breaks via non-homologous end joining by increasing DNA-PKcs activation,

Abstract: Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is one of the major pathways that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). Activation of DNA-PK is required for NHEJ. However, the mechanism leading to DNA-PKcs activation remains incompletely understood. We provide evidence here that the MEK–ERK pathway plays a role in DNA-PKcs-mediated NHEJ. In comparison to the vehicle control (DMSO), etoposide (ETOP)-induced DSBs in MCF7 cells were more rapidly repaired in the presence of U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, based on the reduction of γH2AX and tail moments. Additionally, U0126 increased reactivation of luciferase activity, which resulted from the repair of restriction enzyme-cleaved DSBs. Furthermore, while inhibition of ERK activation using the dominant-negative MEK1K97M accelerated the repair of DSBs, enforcing ERK activation with the constitutively active MEK1Q56P reduced DSB repair. In line with MEK activating ERK1 and ERK2 kinases, knockdown of either ERK1 or ERK2 increased DSB repair. Consistent with the activation of DNA-PKcs being required for NHEJ, we demonstrated that inhibition of ERK activation using U0126, MEK1K97M, and knockdown of ERK1 or ERK2 enhanced ETOP-induced activation of DNA-PKcs. Conversely, enforcing ERK activation by MEK1Q56P reduced ETOP-initiated DNA-PKcs activation. Taken together, we demonstrate that ERK reduces NHEJ-mediated repair of DSBs via attenuation of DNA-PKcs activation.

α-MSH signalling via melanocortin 5 receptor promotes lipolysis and impairs re-esterification in adipocytes,

Abstract: The melanocortin system has a clear effect on the mobilisation of stored lipids in adipocytes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) on α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To this end, MC5R expression was decreased by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which significantly impaired the α-MSH stimulation of lipolysis, as determined by glycerol and nonesterified fatty-acid (NEFA) quantification. The functional role of α-MSH/MC5R on triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis was mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that phosphorylated HSL clearly surrounded lipid droplets in α-MSH-stimulated adipocytes, whereas PLIN1 left the immediate periphery of lipids. These observations were lost when the expression of MC5R was suppressed. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, α-MSH-activated MC5R signals through the cAMP/PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. PKA was fundamental for HSL and PLIN1 activation and lipolysis regulation. ERK1/2 inhibition strongly interfered with the release of NEFAs but not glycerol. In addition, the intracellular TG levels, which were decreased after MC5R activation, were restored after ERK1/2 inhibition, indicating that these kinases are involved in NEFA re-esterification rather than lipolysis regulation. This notion is also supported by the observation that the α-MSH-mediated activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was abolished in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitors. Altogether, these results indicate that α-MSH-activated MC5R regulates two tightly coupled pathways in adipocytes: lipolysis and re-esterification. The global effect is a decrease in adipocyte fat mass, which is important for strategies to ameliorate obesity.

Abstract: Although liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) binds fibrates and PPARα in vitro and enhances fibrate induction of PPARα in transformed cells, the functional significance of these findings is unclear, especially in normal hepatocytes. Studies with cultured primary mouse hepatocytes show that: 1) At physiological (6mM) glucose, fibrates (bezafibrate, fenofibrate) only weakly activated PPARα transcription of genes in LCFA β-oxidation; 2) High (11–20mM) glucose, but not maltose (osmotic control), significantly potentiated fibrate-induction of mRNA of these and other PPARα target genes to increase LCFA β-oxidation. These effects were associated with fibrate-mediated redistribution of L-FABP into nuclei—an effect prolonged by high glucose—but not with increased de novo fatty acid synthesis from glucose; 3) Potentiation of bezafibrate action by high glucose required an intact L-FABP/PPARα signaling pathway as shown with L-FABP null, PPARα null, PPARα inhibitor-treated WT, or PPARα-specific fenofibrate-treated WT hepatocytes. High glucose alone in the absence of fibrate was ineffective. Thus, high glucose potentiation of PPARα occurred through FABP/PPARα rather than indirectly through other PPARs or glucose induced signaling pathways. These data indicated L-FABP's importance in fibrate-induction of hepatic PPARα LCFA β-oxidative genes, especially in the context of high glucose levels.

Abstract: The pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is synthesised as a transmembrane protein that is subject to palmitoylation. In this study, the roles of this acylation on TNF-mediated biological effects were investigated. We found that the lipid raft partitioning of TNF is regulated by its palmitoylation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this palmitoylation process interferes with the cleavage/degradation of TNF intracellular fragments but is not involved in the regulation of its ectodomain shedding. Moreover, we found that the palmitoylation of TNF hinders the binding of soluble TNF to TNFR1 and regulates the integration/retention of TNFR1 into lipid rafts. Finally, we demonstrate that the transmembrane forms of wild-type and palmitoylation-defective TNF interact differently with TNFR1 and regulate NFκB activity, Erk1/2 phosphorylation and interleukin-6 synthesis differently, strongly suggesting that palmitoylation of TNF is involved in the regulation of TNFR1 signalling. An evidence for the physiological intervention of this regulation is provided by the fact that, in macrophages, the binding of endogenous soluble TNF to TNFR1 is enhanced by inhibition of palmitoylation. Therefore, our data introduce the new concept that palmitoylation of TNF is one of the means by which TNF-producing cells regulate their sensitivity to soluble TNF.

Abstract: Numerous Ca2+ signaling events have been associated with early development of vertebrate embryo, from fertilization to organogenesis. In Xenopus laevis, Ca2+ signals are key regulators in the earliest steps of the nervous system development. If neural determination is one of the best-characterized examples of the role of Ca2+ during embryogenesis, increasing literature supports a determining role of organogenesis and differentiation. In blastula the cells of the presumptive ectoderm (animal caps) are pluripotent and can be induced toward neural fate with an intracellular increase of free Ca2+ triggered by caffeine. To identify genes that are transcribed early upon Ca2+ stimuli and involved in neural determination, we have constructed a subtractive cDNA library between neuralized and non-neuralized animal caps. Here we present the expression pattern of three new Ca2+-sensitive genes: fus (fused in sarcoma), brd3 (bromodomain containing 3) and wdr5 (WD repeat domain 5) as they all represent potential regulators of the transcriptional machinery. Using in situ hybridization we illustrated the spatial expression pattern of fus, brd3 and wdr5 during early developmental stages of Xenopus embryos. Strikingly, their domains of expression are not restricted to neural territories. They all share a specific expression throughout renal organogenesis which has been found to rely also on Ca2+ signaling. This therefore highlights the key function of Ca2+ target genes in specific territories during early development. We propose that Ca2+ signaling through modulation of fus, brd3 and wdr5 expressions can control the transcription machinery to achieve proper embryogenesis.

Abstract: The Warburg effect is known to be crucial for cancer cells to acquire energy. Nutrient deficiencies are an important phenomenon in solid tumors, but the effect on cancer cell metabolism is not yet clear. In this study, we demonstrate that starvation of HeLa cells by incubation with Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) induced cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Notably, HBSS starvation increased lactate production, cytoplasmic pyruvate content and decreased oxygen consumption, but failed to change the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity or the glucose uptake. We found that HBSS starvation rapidly induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activation and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphorylation, both of which were inhibited by compound C (an AMPK inhibitor), NAC (a ROS scavenger), and the dominant negative mutant of AMPK. Our data further revealed the involvement of ROS production in AMPK activation. Moreover, DCA (a PDK inhibitor), NAC, and compound C all significantly decreased HBSS starvation-induced lactate production accompanied by enhancement of HBSS starvation-induced cell apoptosis. Not only in HeLa cells, HBSS-induced lactate production and PDH phosphorylation were also observed in CL1.5, A431 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Taken together, we for the first time demonstrated that a low-nutrient condition drives cancer cells to utilize glycolysis to produce ATP, and this increases the Warburg effect through a novel mechanism involving ROS/AMPK-dependent activation of PDK. Such an event contributes to protecting cells from apoptosis upon nutrient deprivation.

Abstract: Sertoli cells express α1 and α4 isoforms of the catalytic subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase (sodium pump). Our recent findings demonstrated that interactions of the α4 isoform with cardiotonic steroids (CTS) like ouabain induce signaling cascades that resemble the so-called non-classical testosterone pathway characterized by activation of the c-Src/c-Raf/Erk1/2/CREB signaling cascade. Here we investigate a possible physiological significance of the activated cascade. The results obtained in the current investigation show that the ouabain-induced signaling cascade also leads to the activation of the CREB-related activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) in the Sertoli cell line 93RS2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as demonstrated by detection of ATF-1 phosphorylated on Ser63 in western blots. The ouabain-activated ATF-1 protein was found to localize to the cell nuclei. The sodium pump α4 isoform mediates this activation, as it is ablated when cells are incubated with siRNA to the α4 isoform. Ouabain also leads to increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) protein, which has been shown to be a downstream consequence of CREB/ATF-1 activation. Taking into consideration that CTS are most likely produced endogenously, the demonstrated induction of StAR expression by ouabain establishes a link between CTS, the α4 isoform of the sodium pump, and steroidogenesis crucial for male fertility and reproduction.

Abstract: 14-3-3 reduces cell proliferation by inhibiting the activity of proteins involved in the signaling pathway that includes Akt kinase. Activation of Akt is enhanced by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). 14-3-3 is also a negative regulator of the mTORC2/Akt pathway, by interacting with a component of mTORC2. Recently, we reported that selenoprotein W (SelW) regulated the interaction between 14-3-3 and its target protein, CDC25B. Here, we show that the binding of Rictor, a component of mTORC2, to 14-3-3, is regulated by the interaction of 14-3-3 with SelW. When SelW was down-regulated, mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was decreased. However, the phosphorylation of Thr308 was not affected. The interaction of Rictor with 14-3-3 was increased in SelW-knockdown cells, as compared to control cells. SelW-knockdown cells were also more sensitive to DNA damage induced by etoposide, than control cells. This phenomenon was due to the decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. We also found that ectopic expression of SelW(U13C) reduced the interaction between Rictor and 14-3-3, leading to Akt phosphorylation at Ser473. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SelW activates the mTORC2/Akt pathway for Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, by interrupting the binding of Rictor to 14-3-3.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) mediates cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apolipoprotein A-I and HDL and plays a role in various important physiological functions. However, the mechanism by which ABCG1 mediates cholesterol translocation is unclear. Protein palmitoylation regulates many functions of proteins such as ABCA1. Here we investigated if ABCG1 is palmitoylated and the subsequent effects on ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We demonstrated that ABCG1 is palmitoylated in both human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in mouse macrophage, J774. Five cysteine residues located at positions 26, 150, 311, 390 and 402 in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic region of ABCG1 were palmitoylated. Removal of palmitoylation at Cys311 by mutating the residue to Ala (C311A) or Ser significantly decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. On the other hand, removal of palmitoylation at sites 26, 150, 390 and 402 had no significant effect. We further demonstrated that mutations of Cys311 affected ABCG1 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, our data suggest that palmitoylation plays a critical role in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux through the regulation of trafficking.

Abstract: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. Protein palmitoylation is known to play roles in signal transduction and in enhancing the hydrophobicity of proteins thus contributing to their membrane association. Global inhibition of protein palmitoylation has been shown to affect T. gondii physiology and invasion of the host cell. However, the proteins affected by this modification have been understudied. This paper shows that the small heat shock protein 20 from T. gondii (TgHSP20) is synthesized as a mature protein in the cytosol and is palmitoylated in three cysteine residues. However, its localization at the inner membrane complex (IMC) is dependent only on N-terminal palmitoylation. Absence or incomplete N-terminal palmitoylation causes TgHSP20 to partially accumulate in a membranous structure. Interestingly, TgHSP20 palmitoylation is not responsible for its interaction with the daughter cells IMCs. Together, our data describe the importance of palmitoylation in protein targeting to the IMC in T. gondii.

Abstract: Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. However, the impact of SCD1 on atherosclerosis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether SCD1 affects macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in mice. Compared to the control, adenoviral-mediated SCD1 overexpression in RAW264.7 macrophages increased cholesterol efflux to HDL, but not to apoA-I, without clear changes in ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI expressions. While knockdown of ABCG1 and SR-BI did not affect the SCD1-induced cholesterol efflux to HDL, SCD1-overexpressing macrophages promoted the formation of both normal- and large-sized HDL in media, accompanying increased apolipoprotein A-I levels in HDL fractions. Transformation to larger particles of HDL was independently confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance-based lipoprotein analysis. Interestingly, media transfer assays revealed that HDL generated by SCD1 had enhanced cholesterol efflux potential, indicating that SCD1 transformed HDL to a more anti-atherogenic phenotype. To study macrophage RCT in vivo, 3H-cholesterol-labeled RAW264.7 cells overexpressing SCD1 or the control were intraperitoneally injected into mice. Supporting the in vitro data, injection of SCD1-macrophages resulted in significant increases in 3H-tracer in plasma, liver, and feces compared to the control. Moreover, there was a shift towards larger particles in the 3H-tracer distribution of HDL fractions obtained from the mice. In conclusion, macrophage-specific SCD1 overexpression promotes overall RCT through increased cholesterol efflux to HDL, suggesting that macrophage SCD1 achieves an anti-atherogenic effect by enhancing RCT.

Abstract: In this study we have used mass spectrometry in order to characterize the HDL lipidome in three groups of women from the DIWA cohort; one control group, plus two groups with type 2 diabetes with insulin resistance; one dyslipidemic and one normolipidemic. The aim was to investigate whether dyslipidemia is required in addition to insulin resistance for the occurrence of an altered HDL lipidome, which in turn might impact HDL functionality. The dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic subjects were distinguished by obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with elevated apoC3, low HDL-cholesterol and chronic low grade inflammation. In a stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, including biomarkers of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as independent variables, only dyslipidemia showed a significant correlation with HDL lipid classes. Small HDL-particles predominated in dyslipidemic subjects in contrast to the normolipidemic diabetic and control groups, and were enriched in lysophosphatidylcholine (+13%), a product of proinflammatory phospholipases, and equally in two core lipids, palmitate-rich triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols (+77 %), thereby reflecting elevated CETP activity. Dyslipidemic small HDL particles were further distinguished not only as the primary carrier of ceramides, which promote inflammation and insulin resistance, but also by a subnormal plasmalogen/apoAI ratio, consistent with elevated oxidative stress typical of type 2 diabetes. From these data we conclude that in type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia predominates relative to hyperglycemia for the occurrence of an altered HDL lipidome. Furthermore, dyslipidemia alters the cargo of bioactive lipids, with implications for HDL function.

Abstract: Infection and inflammation induce important changes in lipid metabolism, which result in increased free fatty acids and triacylglycerol in plasma and altered high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Our aim was to elucidate whether hepatic lipid droplets (LDs) are involved in the adaptations of lipid metabolism to endotoxemia. We characterized the lipid content and several enzymatic activities in subcellular fractions and subpopulations of LDs from livers of mice 24h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and analyzed the expression of key genes involved in lipid management. Endotoxemic mice showed lower lipid content in LDs with decreased molar fraction of cholesteryl ester and higher diacylglycerol/triacylglycerol ratio as compared to their controls. They also showed a decrease in cytosolic triacylglycerol hydrolase activity, specifically in dense LDs, and in microsomal and cytosolic diacylglycerol hydrolase activity; concomitantly neutral lipid biosynthetic capacity and triacylglycerol levels in plasma lipoproteins increased. Together with the overexpression of genes involved in lipogenesis and HDL formation our results suggest that altered hepatic management of LD lipids in LPS-treated mice might be related to the channeled mobilization of triacylglycerol for very low density lipoprotein assembly and to the induction of cholesterol export.

Abstract: Objective
The HDL associated apolipoprotein M (apoM) protects against experimental atherosclerosis but the mechanism is unknown. ApoM increases preβ-HDL formation. We explored whether plasma apoM affects mobilization of cholesterol from peripheral cells in mice.
Methods and results
ApoM-enriched HDL from apoM-transgenic mice increased the in vitro efflux of 3H-cholesterol from macrophages by 24±3% (p<0.05) as compared with HDL from wild type (WT) mice, thus confirming previous findings. However, apoM-free HDL was not poorer than that of WT HDL to mobilize 3H-cholesterol. 3H-cholesterol-labeled foam cells were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of apoM−/−, WT and apoM-transgenic mice to assess the mobilization of cholesterol from foam cells in vivo and subsequent excretion into feces. The results showed a statistically non-significant trend towards increased mobilization of cellular cholesterol to plasma with increasing plasma apoM. However, the apoM-genotype did not affect the excretion of 3H-cholesterol in feces. Nevertheless, when apoM−/−, apoM-transgenic and WT mice received a constant intravenous infusion of 13C2-cholesterol/intralipid for 5h, the rate of enrichment of blood free cholesterol with free 13C2-cholesterol was significantly lower (consistent with an increase in flux of unlabeled free cholesterol into the plasma) in the apoM-transgenic (3.0±0.9‰/h) as compared to WT (5.7±0.9‰/h, p<0.05) and apoM−/− (6.5±0.6‰/h, p<0.01) mice.
Conclusion
The present data indicate that the plasma apoM levels modulate the ability of plasma to mobilize cellular cholesterol, whereas apoM has no major effect on the excretion of cholesterol into feces.

Abstract: Obesity results in increased macrophage recruitment to adipose tissue that promotes a chronic low-grade inflammatory state linked to increased fatty acid efflux from adipocytes. Activated macrophages produce a variety of pro-inflammatory lipids such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) suggesting the hypothesis that fatty acids may stimulate eicosanoid synthesis. To assess if eicosanoid production increases with obesity, adipose tissue of leptin deficient ob/ob mice was analyzed. In ob/ob mice, LTC4 and 12-HETE levels increased in the visceral (but not subcutaneous) adipose depot while the 5-HETE levels decreased and 15-HETE abundance was unchanged. Since macrophages produce the majority of inflammatory molecules in adipose tissue, treatment of RAW264.7 or primary peritoneal macrophages with free fatty acids led to increased secretion of LTC4 and 5-HETE, but not 12- or 15-HETE. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) facilitate the intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands and in vitro stabilize the LTC4 precursor leukotriene A4 (LTA4) from non-enzymatic hydrolysis. Consistent with a role for FABPs in LTC4 synthesis, treatment of macrophages with HTS01037, a specific FABP inhibitor, resulted in a marked decrease in both basal and fatty acid-stimulated LTC4 secretion but no change in 5-HETE production or 5-lipoxygenase expression. These results indicate that the products of adipocyte lipolysis may stimulate the 5-lipoxygenase pathway leading to FABP-dependent production of LTC4 and contribute to the insulin resistant state.

Abstract: The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell fate decision, and is also a key regulator of cell differentiation, including bone homeostasis, in a variety of contexts. However, the role of Notch1 signaling in osteoclast differentiation is still controversial. In this study, we show that Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation is promoted by the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) and Ca2+/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) signaling. Notch1-IC protein level was augmented by CaMKIV through escape from ubiquitin dependent protein degradation. In addition, CaMKIV remarkably increased Notch1-IC stability, and the kinase activity of CaMKIV was essential for facilitating Notch1 signaling. CaMKIV directly interacted with Notch1-IC and phosphorylates Notch1-IC, thereby decreasing proteasomal protein degradation through F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7). We also found that Notch1-IC prevented inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by KN-93 but not the phosphorylation deficient form of Notch1-IC. These results suggest that phosphorylated Notch1-IC by CaMKIV increases Notch1-IC stability, which enhances osteoclast differentiation.

Abstract: We recently described that epidermal and fibroblast growth factors (EGF and FGF) regulate the IGF-I signaling pathway at the level of IRS-1 through the cooperative action of two independent signaling pathways; one dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and the other on protein kinase D1 (PKD1) (Karam et al. [22]). To determine whether this mechanism could be generalized to another tyrosine kinase receptor-dependent growth factor, the effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on the IGF-I signaling pathway was studied. PDGF inhibited IGF-I-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity, and stimulated IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation. These effects were mediated through a PI 3-kinase-dependent but extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-independent signaling pathway. However, PDGF-induced IRS-1 serine 307 phosphorylation was not sufficient per se to inhibit the IGF-I signaling but required another independent pathway. Noteworthy, although acutely stimulated by PDGF, and contrary to what we previously described (Karam et al. [22]), PKD1 did not associate with IRS-1and did not inhibit the IGF-I signaling in response to PDGF. However, we identified PKCβI as a new regulatory partner of PI 3-kinase for PDGF-induced inhibition of the IGF-I signaling pathway. Therefore, our results reinforce the idea that a coordinated action of two independent pathways seems absolutely necessary to negatively regulate IRS-1. Moreover, they also demonstrated that, depending of the cross-talk considered, subtle and specific regulatory mechanisms occur at the level of IRS-1 and that a unique regulatory model is not conceivable.

Abstract: As a signaling scaffold, p62/sequestosome (p62/SQSTM1) plays important roles in cell signaling and degradation of misfolded proteins. While localization of p62 to mitochondria has been reported, a description of its function once there, remains unclear. Here, we report that p62 is localized to mitochondria in non-stressed situations and demonstrate that deficiency in p62 exacerbates defects in mitochondrial membrane potential and energetics leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. We report on the relationship between mitochondrial protein import and p62. In a p62 null background, mitochondrial import of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM is disrupted. When p62 is returned, mitochondrial function is restored to more normal levels. We identify for the first time that p62 localization plays a role in regulating mitochondrial morphology, genome integrity and mitochondrial import of a key transcription factor. We present evidence that these responses to the presence of p62 extend beyond the protein's immediate influence on membrane potential.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of systemic glucose and insulin homeostasis; however, its exact role in adipocytes is poorly understood. This study was to elucidate the role of PTP1B in adipocyte differentiation and its implication in obesity. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 white preadipocytes, PTP1B decreased progressively with adipocyte maturation. Lentivirus-mediated PTP1B overexpression in preadipocytes delayed adipocyte differentiation, shown as lack of mature adipocytes, low level of lipid accumulation, and down-regulation of main markers (PPARγ2, SREBP-1c, FAS and LPL). In contrast, lentivirus-mediated PTP1B knockdown accelerated adipocyte differentiation, demonstrated as full of mature adipocytes, high level of lipid accumulation, and up-regulation of main markers. Dominant-negative inhibition on endogenous PTP1B by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of PTP1B double mutant in Tyr-46 and Asp-181 residues (LV-D/A-Y/F) also stimulated adipogenesis, more efficient than PTP1B knockdown. Diet-induced obesity mice exhibited an up-regulation of PTP1B and TNFα accompanied by a down-regulation of PPARγ2 in white adipose tissue. TNFα recombinant protein impeded PTP1B reduction and inhibited adipocyte differentiation in vitro; this inhibitory effect was prevented by LV-D/A-Y/F. Moreover, PTP1B inhibitor treatment improved adipogenesis and suppressed TNFα in adipose tissue of obese mice. All together, PTP1B negatively regulates adipocyte development and may mediate TNFα action to impair adipocyte differentiation in obesity. Our study provides novel evidence for the importance of PTP1B in obesity and for the potential application of PTP1B inhibitors.

Abstract: Ceramide is a major molecule among the sphingolipid metabolites which are produced in the brain and other organs and act as intracellular second messengers. Although a variety of physiological roles of ceramide have been reported in the periphery and central nervous systems, the role of ceramide in microglial activation has not been clearly demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the effects of exogenous cell permeable short chain ceramides on microglial activation in vitro and in vivo. We found that C2, C6, and C8 ceramide and C8 ceramide-1-phosphate inhibited iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and rat primary microglia. In addition, the administration of C2 ceramide suppressed microglial activation in the brains of LPS-exposed mice. By HPLC and LC/MS/MS analyses, we found that C2 ceramide on its own, rather than its modified form (i.e. ceramide-1-phosphate or long chain ceramides), mainly work by penetrating into microglial cells. Further mechanistic studies by using the most effective C2 ceramide among the short chain ceramides tested, revealed that C2 ceramide exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the ROS, MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and Jak/STAT pathways with upregulation of PKA and hemeoxygenase-1 expressions. Interestingly, we found that C2 ceramide inhibits TLR4 signaling by interfering with LPS and TLR4 interactions. Therefore, our data collectively suggests the therapeutic potential of short chain ceramides such as C2 for neuroinflammatory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are now emerging as a new class of anticancer drugs. Some of them have been used in clinical treatment for tumors, most impressively in the hematological tumors. But their single-agent activities in epithelial-derived tumors are limited. The mechanisms of these actions of HDACIs are not yet well understood. In this study, it was found for the first time that HDACIs were able to induce epithelial–mesenchymal transitions (EMT) which is believed to trigger tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We show that HDACIs induce fibroblast-like morphology, up-regulate Snail and Vimentin and down-regulate E-cadherin in epithelial cell-derived tumor cell lines. It demonstrates that HDACI treatment enhances further Snail acetylation and reduces its ubiquitylation, and induces Snail transcription as well as Snail nuclear translocation in CNE2 cells. Snail knockdown by siRNAs prevents the change in cell morphology and Vimentin up-regulation in response to HDACIs. The results suggested that Snail plays an important role in the HDACI-induced EMT. It is very crucial for a better understanding of clinical therapeutical failure of HDACIs in the patients with epithelial cell-derived cancers. Therefore, our results indicate that more attention should be paid to the cancer treatment using HDACIs due to the fact that it will enhance the spread risks of cancer cells to facilitate cancer progression and it is very important to select appropriate drugs for different tumors.

Abstract: Neuronal activity and energy metabolism are tightly coupled processes. Previously, we found that nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) transcriptionally co-regulates energy metabolism and neuronal activity by regulating all 13 subunits of the critical energy generating enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), as well as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits 1 and 2B, GluN1 (Grin1) and GluN2B (Grin2b). We also found that another transcription factor, nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2 or GA-binding protein) regulates all subunits of COX as well. The goal of the present study was to test our hypothesis that NRF-2 also regulates specific subunits of NMDA receptors, and that it functions with NRF-1 via one of three mechanisms: complementary, concurrent and parallel, or a combination of complementary and concurrent/parallel. By means of multiple approaches, including in silico analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation of mouse neuroblastoma cells and rat visual cortical tissue, promoter mutations, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blot analysis, NRF-2 was found to functionally regulate Grin1 and Grin2b genes, but not any other NMDA subunit genes. Grin1 and Grin2b transcripts were up-regulated by depolarizing KCl, but silencing of NRF-2 prevented this up-regulation. On the other hand, over-expression of NRF-2 rescued the down-regulation of these subunits by the impulse blocker TTX. NRF-2 binding sites on Grin1 and Grin2b are conserved among species. Our data indicate that NRF-2 and NRF-1 operate in a concurrent and parallel manner in mediating the tight coupling between energy metabolism and neuronal activity at the molecular level.

Abstract: The S100A3 homotetramer assembles upon citrullination of a specific symmetric Arg51 pair on its homodimer interface in human hair cuticular cells. Each S100A3 subunit contains two EF-hand-type Ca2+-binding motifs and one (Cys)3His-type Zn2+-binding site in the C-terminus. The C-terminal coiled domain is cross-linked to the presumed docking surface of the dimeric S100A3 via a disulfide bridge. The aim of this study was to determine the structural and functional role of the C-terminal Zn2+-binding domain, which is unique to S100A3, in homotetramer assembly. The binding of either Ca2+ or Zn2+ reduced the α-helix content of S100A3 and modulated its affinity for the other cation. The binding of a single Zn2+ accelerated the Ca2+-dependent tetramerization of S100A3 while inducing an extensive unfolding of helix IV. The Ca2+ and Zn2+ binding affinities of S100A3 were enhanced when the other cation bound in concert with the tetramerization of S100A3. Small angle scattering analyses revealed that the overall structure of the S100A3 tetramer bound both Ca2+ and Zn2+ had a similar molecular shape to the Ca2+-bound form in solution. The binding states of the Ca2+ or Zn2+ to each S100A3 subunit within a homotetramer appear to be propagated by sensing the repositioning of helix III and the rearrangement of the C-terminal tail domain.

Abstract: The effect of numerous anticancer drugs on breast cancer cell lines and rodent mammary tumors can be enhanced by a treatment with long-chain n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n−3 PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n−3) which is a natural ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). In order to identify the PPAR regulating breast cancer cell growth, we tested the impact of siRNA, selected to suppress PPARα, PPARβ or PPARγ mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. The siPPARβ was the most effective to inhibit breast cancer cell growth in both cell lines. Using PPARα, PPARβ and PPARγ pharmacological antagonists, we showed that PPARβ regulated DHA-induced inhibition of growth in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. In addition, the expressions of all 3 PPAR mRNA were co-regulated in both cell lines, upon treatments with siRNA or PPAR antagonists. PPAR mRNA expression was also examined in the NitrosoMethylUrea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model. The expressions of PPARα and PPARβ mRNAs were correlated in the control group but not in the n−3 PUFA group in which the expression of PPARβ mRNA was reduced. Although PPARα expression was also increased in the n−3 PUFA-enriched diet group under docetaxel treatment, it is only the expression of PPARβ mRNA that correlated with the regression of mammary tumors: those that most regressed displayed the lowest PPARβ mRNA expression. Altogether, these data identify PPARβ as an important player capable of modulating other PPAR mRNA expressions, under DHA diet, for inhibiting breast cancer cell growth and mammary tumor growth.

Abstract: p27 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that suppresses a cell's transition from G0 to S phase, therefore acting as a tumor suppressor. Our most recent studies demonstrate that upon arsenite exposure, p27 suppresses Hsp27 and Hsp70 expressions through the JNK2/c-Jun- and HSF-1-dependent pathways, suggesting a novel molecular mechanism underlying the tumor suppressive function of p27 in a CDK-independent manner. We found that p27-deficiency (p27−/−) resulted in the elevation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression at transcriptional level, whereas the introduction of p27 brought back COX-2 expression to a level similar to that of p27+/+ cells, suggesting that p27 exhibits an inhibitory effect on COX-2 expression. Further studies identified that p27 inhibition of COX-2 expression was specifically due to phosphorylation of transcription factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation mediated by p38β and p38δ. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying tumor suppression effect of p27 and will contribute to the understanding of the overall mechanism of p27 tumor suppression in a CDK-independent manner.

Reciprocal regulation of miR-23a and lysophosphatidic acid receptor signaling in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,

Abstract: Earlier, our study demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, the subtype-specific functions for LPA1 and LPA3 receptors in LPA-induced hypertrophy have not been distinguished. Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy by down-regulating target molecules. The present work therefore aimed at elucidating the functions mediated by different subtypes of LPA receptors and investigating the modulatory role of miRNAs during LPA induced hypertrophy. Experiments were done with cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) exposed to LPA and we showed that knockdown of LPA1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas LPA3 silencing repressed hypertrophy. miR-23a, a pro-hypertrophic miRNA, was up-regulated by LPA in cardiomyocytes and its down-regulation reduced LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Importantly, luciferase reporter assay confirmed LPA1 to be a target of miR-23a, indicating that miR-23a is involved in mediating the LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting LPA1. In addition, knockdown of LPA3, but not LPA1, eliminated miR-23a elevation induced by LPA. And PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, effectively prevented LPA-induced miR-23a expression in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that LPA might induce miR-23a elevation by activating LPA3 and PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings identified opposite subtype-specific functions for LPA1 and LPA3 in mediating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and indicated LPA1 to be a target of miR-23a, which discloses a link between miR-23a and the LPA receptor signaling in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Abstract: Increasing hepatic stellate cell (HSC) death is a very attractive approach for limiting liver fibrosis. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to have anti-fibrotic properties, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identified the mechanism of action of the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib in inducing HSC death. Human HSC line (LX-2) and rat HSCs were treated with nilotinib and its predecessor, imatinib, in the absence or presence of various blockers, known to interfere with death signaling pathways. Nilotinib, but not imatinib, induced progressive cell death of activated, but not quiescent, HSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Activated HSCs died through apoptosis, as denoted by increased DNA fragmentation and caspase activation, and through autophagy, as indicated by the accumulation of autophagic markers, light chain (LC)3A-II and LC3B-II. Although inhibition of caspases with Z-VAD-FMK suppressed nilotinib-induced HSCs' apoptosis, there was no increase in HSCs' survival, because autophagy was exacerbated. However, blocking the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening with cyclosporin A completely abolished both apoptosis and autophagy due to nilotinib. Moreover, nilotinib treatment decreased the protein expression of histone deacetylases 1, 2 and 4. Interestingly, pretreament with C646, a selective p300/CBP histone acetyl transferase inhibitor, resulted in diverting nilotinib-induced apoptosis and autophagy towards necrosis. In conclusion, the identification of mPTP as a target of nilotinib in activated HSCs suggests coordination with histone deacetylases inhibition to induce apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the anti-fibrotic effects of nilotinib.

Involvement of phospholipase A/acyltransferase-1 in N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine generation,

Abstract: Anandamide and other bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a class of lipid mediators and are produced from glycerophospholipids via N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs). Although the generation of NAPE by N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine is thought to be the rate-limiting step of NAE biosynthesis, the enzyme responsible, N-acyltransferase, remains poorly characterized. Recently, we found that five members of the HRAS-like suppressor (HRASLS) family, which were originally discovered as tumor suppressors, possess phospholipid-metabolizing activities including NAPE-forming N-acyltransferase activity, and proposed to call HRASLS1–5 phospholipase A/acyltransferase (PLA/AT)-1–5, respectively. Among the five members, PLA/AT-1 attracts attention because of its relatively high N-acyltransferase activity and predominant expression in testis, skeletal muscle, brain and heart of human, mouse and rat. Here, we examined the formation of NAPE by PLA/AT-1 in living cells. As analyzed by metabolic labeling with [14C]ethanolamine or [14C]palmitic acid, the transient expression of human, mouse and rat PLA/AT-1s in COS-7 cells as well as the stable expression of human PLA/AT-1 in HEK293 cells significantly increased the generation of NAPE and NAE. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry also exhibited that the stable expression of PLA/AT-1 enhanced endogenous levels of NAPE, N-acylplasmenylethanolamine, NAE and glycerophospho-NAE. Furthermore, the knockdown of endogenous PLA/AT-1 in mouse ATDC5 cells lowered NAPE levels. Interestingly, the dysfunction of peroxisomes, which was caused by PLA/AT-2 and -3, was not observed in the PLA/AT-1-expressing HEK293 cells. Altogether, these results suggest that PLA/AT-1 is at least partly responsible for the generation of NAPE in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Thyroid hormone 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) is known to affect cell metabolism through both the genomic and non-genomic actions. Recently, we demonstrated in HepG2 cells that T3 controls the expression of SREBP-1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. This occurs by activation of a cap-independent translation mechanism of its mRNA. Such a process is dependent on non-genomic activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The physiological role of 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (T2), previously considered only as a T3 catabolite, is of growing interest. Evidences have been reported that T2 rapidly affects some metabolic pathways through non-genomic mechanisms. Here, we show that T2, unlike T3, determines the block of proteolytic cleavage of SREBP-1 in HepG2 cells, without affecting its expression at the transcriptional or translational level. Consequently, Fatty Acid Synthase expression is reduced. T2 effects depend on the concurrent activation of MAPKs ERK and p38, of Akt and PKC-δ pathways. Upon the activation of these signals, apoptosis of HepG2 cells seems to occur, starting at 12h of T2 treatment. PKC-δ appears to act as a switch between p38 activation and Akt suppression, suggesting that this PKC may function as a controller in the balance of pro-apoptotic (p38) and anti-apoptotic (Akt) signals in HepG2 cells.

Abstract: Chronic hyperglycaemia during diabetes leads to non-enzymatic glycation of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that contribute to nephropathy. We describe AGE uptake in LLC-PK1 and HK2 proximal tubule cell lines by macropinocytosis, a non-specific, endocytic mechanism. AGE–BSA induced dorsal circular actin ruffles and amiloride-sensitive dextran–TRITC uptake, significantly increased AGE–BSA–FITC uptake (167±20% vs BSA control, p<0.01) and was ezrin-dependent. AGE–BSA–FITC uptake was significantly inhibited by amiloride and inhibitors of Arf6, Rac1, racGEF Tiam1, PAK1 and actin polymerisation. AGE–BSA–FITC, Arf6 and PIP2 co-localised within dorsal circular actin ruffles. AGE–BSA increased PAK1 kinase activity (212±41% vs control, p<0.05) and protein levels of Tiam1, a Rac1 activator. AGE–BSA significantly increased TGF-β1 protein levels (160±6%, p<0.001 vs BSA), which were significantly inhibited by inhibitors of Arf6 (82±19%, p<0.001 vs AGE) and actin polymerisation (107±11%, p<0.001 vs AGE), suggesting AGEs partially exert their profibrotic effects via macropinocytosis. PAK1 and PIP5Kγ siRNA significantly decreased AGE–BSA–FITC uptake (81±6% and 64±7%, respectively, p<0.05 vs control for both), and AGE-stimulated TGF-β1 protein release (99±15% and 49±8% of control, p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). Inhibition of AGE uptake by macropinocytosis inhibitors and a neutralising TGF-β antibody, reversed the AGE-induced decrease in surface Na+K+ATPase, suggesting AGE uptake by macropinocytosis may contribute to diabetic kidney fibrosis and/or EMT by modulating this pump. Understanding methods of cellular uptake and signalling by AGEs may lead to novel therapies for diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: The cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans is an important dental pathogen that forms biofilms on tooth surfaces, which provide a protective niche for the bacterium where it secretes organic acids leading to the demineralization of tooth enamel. Lipids, especially glycolipids are likely to be key components of these biofilm matrices. The UA159 strain of S. mutans was among the earliest microorganisms to have its genome sequenced. While the lipids of other S. mutans strains have been identified and characterized, lipid analyses of UA159 have been limited to a few studies on its fatty acids. Here we report the structures of the four major glycolipids from stationary-phase S. mutans UA159 cells grown in standing cultures. These were shown to be monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGDAG), diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGDAG), diglucosylmonoacylglycerol (DGMAG) and, glycerophosphoryldiglucosyldiacylglycerol (GPDGDAG). The structures were determined by high performance thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The glycolipids were identified by accurate, high resolution, and tandem mass spectrometry. The identities of the sugar units in the glycolipids were determined by a novel and highly efficient NMR method. All sugars were shown to have α-glycosidic linkages and DGMAG was shown to be acylated in the sn-1 position by NMR. This is the first observation of unsubstituted DGMAG in any organism and the first mass spectrometry data for GPDGDAG.

Abstract: Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 37 (UCH37) plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes and is also involved in oncogenesis. In this study, clinicopathologic data showed that UCH37 was over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancerous tissues and was a significant predictor for time to recurrence (TTR). In vitro, we discovered that UCH37 could promote cell migration and invasion. Subsequently, we utilized Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify differentially expressed proteins in UCH37 over-expressing cells compared with the control cells, and found that PRP19, an essential RNA splicing factor, was up-regulated. The relationship between UCH37, PRP19 and the capability of cell migration and invasion was further confirmed. Collectively, this study demonstrated that UCH37 could promote cell migration and invasion in HCC cell lines through interacting and deubiquitinating PRP19, and suggested that UCH37 could be a novel predictor for HCC recurrence after curative resection.

Abstract: Background: Atherosclerosis begins as local inflammation of vessels at sites of disturbed flow, where low shear stress (LSS) leads to mechanical irritation and plaque development and progression. Nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is associated with the inflammation response during atherosclerosis. We investigated the role and underlying mechanism of PARP-1 in LSS-induced inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Methods and results: HUVECs were simulated by LSS (0.4Pa). PARP-1 expression was inhibited by ABT888 or siRNA. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) expression was regulated by LSS in a time dependent manner. LSS could increase superoxide production and 3-nitrotyrosine formation. LSS induced DNA damage as assessed by H2A.X phosphorylation and comet assay. Compared with cells under static, LSS increased PARP-1 expression and PAR formation via MEK/ERK signaling pathway. PARP-1 inhibition increased Sirt1 activity through an increased intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) level. Moreover, PARP-1 inhibition attenuated LSS-induced iNOS and ICAM-1 upregulation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and activity, with a reduced NF-κB phosphorylation. Conclusions: LSS induced oxidative damage and PARP-1 activation via MEK/ERK pathway. PARP-1 inhibition restored Sirt1 activity by increasing NAD+ level and decreased iNOS and ICAM-1 expression by inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation and activity as well as NF-κB phosphorylation. PARP-1 played a fundamental role in LSS induced inflammation. Inhibition of PARP-1 might be a mechanism for treatment of inflammation response during atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; also known as CCN2) is an inflammatory mediator, and shows elevated levels in regions of severe injury and inflammatory diseases. CTGF is abundantly expressed in osteoarthritis (OA). Migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells to inflammatory sites are playing important roles during OA pathogenesis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is the key chemokine that regulates migration and infiltration of monocytes. However, the effect of CTGF on MCP-1 expression and monocyte migration is largely unknown. Our results showed that MCP-1 was highly expressed in OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) as compared with normal SFs. Directly applying OASFs with CTGF increased MCP-1 expression in a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. CTGF mediated MCP-1 production was attenuated by αvβ5 integrin neutralized antibody. Pretreatment with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), MEK, AP-1, and NF-κB inhibitors also inhibited the potentiating action of CTGF. CTGF-mediated increase of NF-κB and AP-1 luciferase activity was inhibited by FAK, MEK, and ERK inhibitors or mutants. In vitro chemotaxis assay showed that OA synovial fluid and supernatants from CTGF treated OASFs increased migration of monocyte. In addition, CTGF-mediated migration was inhibited by the FAK and MEK inhibitors. Taken together, our results indicated that CTGF enhances the migration of monocyte cells by increasing MCP-1 expression through the αvβ5 integrin, FAK, MEK, ERK, and NF-κB/AP-1 signal transduction pathway.

Abstract: Aberrant expression of the proto-oncogene EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site1) has been implicated not only in myeloid or lymphoid malignancies but also in colon, ovarian and breast cancers. Despite its importance in oncogenesis, the regulatory factors and mechanisms that potentiate the function of EVI1 and its consequences are partially known. Here we demonstrated that EVI1 is post-translationally modified by SUMO1 at lysine residues 533, 698 and 874. Although both EVI1 and SUMO1 were found to co-localize in nuclear speckles, the sumoylation mutant of EVI1 failed to co-localize with SUMO1. Sumoylation abrogated the DNA binding efficiency of EVI1 and also affected EVI1 mediated transactivation. The SUMO ligase PIASy was found to play a bi-directional role on EVI1, PIASy enhanced EVI1 sumoylation and augmented sumoylated EVI1 mediated repression. PIASy was also found to interact with EVI1 and impaired EVI1 transcriptional activity independent of its ligase activity. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) known to act as an antileukemic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) not only enhanced EVI1 sumoylation but also enhanced the co-localization of EVI1 and SUMO1 in nuclear bodies distinct from PML nuclear bodies. ATO treatment also affected the Bcl-xL protein expression in EVI1 positive cell line. Thus, the results showed that arsenic treatment enhanced EVI1 sumoylation, deregulated Bcl-xL, which eventually may induce apoptosis in EVI1 positive cancer cells. The study for the first time explores and reports sumoylation of EVI1, which plays an essential role in regulating its function.

PPARγ agonists upregulate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 expression, which in turn reduces S1P-induced [Ca2+]i increases in renal mesangial cells,

Abstract: We previously identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists (thiazolidinediones, TZDs) as modulators of the sphingolipid metabolism in renal mesangial cells. TZDs upregulated sphingosine kinase 1 (SK-1) and increased the formation of intracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which in turn reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic connective tissue growth factor. Since S1P also acts as extracellular ligand at specific S1P receptors (S1PR, S1P1–5), we investigated here the effect of TZDs on S1PR expression in mesangial cells and evaluated the functional consequences by measuring S1P-induced increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Treatment with two different TZDs, troglitazone and rosiglitazone, enhanced S1P1 mRNA and protein expression in rat mesangial cells, whereas S1P2–5 expression levels were not altered. Upregulation of S1P1 mRNA upon TZD treatment was also detected in human mesangial cells and mouse glomeruli. PPARγ antagonism and promoter studies revealed that the TZD-dependent S1P1 mRNA induction involved a functional PPAR response element in the S1P1 promoter. Pharmacological approaches disclosed that S1P-induced [Ca2+]i increases in rat mesangial cells were predominantly mediated by S1P2 and S1P3. Interestingly, the transcriptional upregulation of S1P1 by TZDs resulted in a reduction of S1P-induced [Ca2+]i increases, which was reversed by the S1P1/3 antagonist VPC-23019, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor PKC-412, and by S1P1 siRNA. These data suggest that PPARγ-dependent upregulation of S1P1 leads to an inhibition of S1P-induced Ca2+ signaling in a PKC-dependent manner. Overall, these results reveal that TZDs not only modulate intracellular S1P levels but also regulate S1PR signaling by increasing S1P1 expression in mesangial cells.

Abstract: Telomere length maintenance is critical for organisms' long-term survival and cancer cell proliferation. Telomeres are kept within species-specific length ranges by the interplay between telomerase activity and telomeric chromatin organization. In this paper, we exploited telomerase immortalized human fibroblasts (cen3tel) that gradually underwent neoplastic transformation during culture propagation to study telomere composition and length regulation during the transformation process. Just after telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) expression, cen3tel telomeres shortened despite the presence of telomerase activity. At a later stage and concomitantly with transformation, cells started elongating telomeres, which reached a mean length greater than 100kb in about 900 population doublings. Super-telomeres were stable and compatible with cell growth and tumorigenesis. Telomere extension was associated with increasing levels of telomerase activity that were linked to the deregulation of endogenous telomerase RNA (hTERC) and exogenous telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Notably, the increase in hTERC levels paralleled the increase in telomerase activity, suggesting that this subunit plays a role in regulating enzyme activity. Telomeres ranging in length between 10 and more than 100kb were maintained in an extendible state although TRF1 and TRF2 binding increased with telomere length. Super-telomeres neither influenced subtelomeric region global methylation nor the expression of the subtelomeric gene FRG1, attesting the lack of a clear-cut relationship between telomere length, subtelomeric DNA methylation and expression in human cells. The cellular levels of the telomeric proteins hTERT, TRF1, TRF2 and Hsp90 rose with transformation and were independent of telomere length, pointing to a role of these proteins in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Bile acids play multiple roles in the physiology of vertebrates; they facilitate lipid absorption, serve as signaling molecules to control carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and provide a disposal route for cholesterol. Unexpectedly, the α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) deficient mice, which are unable to complete the peroxisomal cleavage of C27-precursors to the mature C24-bile acids, are physiologically asymptomatic when maintained on a standard laboratory diet. The aim of this study was to uncover the underlying adaptive mechanism with special reference to cholesterol and bile acid metabolism that allows these mice to have a normal life span. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in Amacr−/− mice is decreased resulting in a 2-fold increase in daily cholesterol excretion. Also fecal excretion of bile acids (mainly C27-sterols) is enhanced 3-fold. However, the body cholesterol pool remains unchanged, although Amacr-deficiency accelerates hepatic sterol synthesis 5-fold. Changes in lipoprotein profiles are mainly due to decreased phospholipid transfer protein activity. Thus Amacr-deficient mice provide a unique example of metabolic regulation, which allows them to have a normal lifespan in spite of the disruption of a major metabolic pathway. This metabolic adjustment can be mainly explained by setting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism to a new balanced level in the Amacr-deficient mouse.

Abstract: The CacyBP/SIP protein interacts with several targets, including actin. Since the majority of actin filaments are associated with tropomyosin, in this work we characterized binding of CacyBP/SIP to the actin–tropomyosin complex and examined the effects of CacyBP/SIP on actin filament functions. By using reconstituted filaments composed of actin and AEDANS-labeled tropomyosin, we observed that binding of CacyBP/SIP caused an increase in tropomyosin fluorescence intensity indicating the occurrence of conformational changes within the filament. We also found that CacyBP/SIP bound directly to tropomyosin and that these proteins did not compete with each other for binding to actin. Electron microscopy showed that in the absence of tropomyosin CacyBP/SIP destabilized actin filaments, but tropomyosin reversed this effect. Actin-activated myosin S1 ATPase activity assays, performed using a colorimetric method, indicated that CacyBP/SIP reduced ATPase activity and that the presence of tropomyosin enhanced this inhibitory effect. Thus, our results suggest that CacyBP/SIP, through its interaction with both actin and tropomyosin, regulates the organization and functional properties of the thin filament.

Abstract: Vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital cellular process in all eukaryotes responsible for moving secretory cargoes from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. To accomplish this feat, the cell employs a set of conserved cytoplasmic coat proteins – the coat protein II (COPII) complex – that recruit cargo into nascent buds and deform the ER membrane to drive vesicle formation. While our understanding of COPII coat mechanics has developed substantially since its discovery, we have only recently begun to appreciate the factors that regulate this complex and, in turn, ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Here, we describe these factors and their influences on COPII vesicle formation. Properties intrinsic to the GTP cycle of the coat, as well as coat structure, have critical implications for COPII vesicle trafficking. Extrinsic factors in the cytosol can modulate COPII activity through direct interaction with the coat or with scaffolding components, or by changing composition of the ER membrane. Further, lumenal and membrane-bound cargoes and cargo receptors can influence COPII-mediated trafficking in equally profound ways. Together, these factors work in concert to ensure proper cargo movement in this first step of the secretory pathway. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: The molecular mechanism of Salinomycin's toxicity is not fully understood. Various studies reported that Ca2+, cytochrome c, and caspase activation play a role in Salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Salinomycin may target Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote differentiation and thus elimination of cancer stem cells. In this study, we show a massive autophagic response to Salinomycin (substantially stronger than to commonly used autophagic inducer Rapamycin) in prostrate-, breast cancer cells, and to lesser degree in human normal dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, autophagy induced by Salinomycin is a cell protective mechanism in all tested cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Salinomycin induces mitophagy, mitoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) in a subpopulation of cells. Salinomycin strongly, and in time-dependent manner decreases cellular ATP level. Contrastingly, human normal dermal fibroblasts treated with Salinomycin show some initial decrease in mitochondrial mass, however they are largely resistant to Salinomycin-triggered ATP-depletion. Our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of preferential toxicity of Salinomycin towards cancer cells, and suggest possible clinical application of Salinomycin in combination with autophagy inhibitors (i.e. clinically-used Chloroquine). Furthermore, we discuss preferential Salinomycins toxicity in the context of Warburg effect.

Abstract: The accumulation of reactive aldehydes is implicated in the development of several disorders. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) detoxify aldehydes by oxidizing them to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, ALDH3A2 is the only known ALDH that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain fatty aldehydes including C16 aldehydes (hexadecanal and trans-2-hexadecenal) generated through sphingolipid metabolism. In the present study, we have identified that ALDH3B1 is also active in vitro toward C16 aldehydes and demonstrated that overexpression of ALDH3B1 restores the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells. In addition, we have determined that ALDH3B1 is localized in the plasma membrane through its C-terminal dual lipidation (palmitoylation and prenylation) and shown that the prenylation is required particularly for the activity toward hexadecanal. Since knockdown of ALDH3B1 does not cause further impairment of the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells, the likely physiological function of ALDH3B1 is to oxidize lipid-derived aldehydes generated in the plasma membrane and not to be involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: The adsorption of colipase is essential for pancreatic triglyceride lipase activity and efficient dietary fat digestion. Yet, little is known about which specific amino acids in the hydrophobic surface of colipase influence adsorption. In this study, we systematically substituted alanine or tryptophan at residues implicated in adsorption of colipase to an interface. We expressed, purified recombinant colipase mutants and characterized the ability of each alanine mutant to restore activity to lipase in the presence of bile salts. The functions of L16A, Y55A, I79A and F84A colipase were most impaired with activities ranging from 20 to 60% of wild-type colipase. We next characterized the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan mutants in the absence and presence of bile–salt–oleic acid mixed micelles. We performed steady-state emission spectra to determine peak shift and I330/I350 ratio and acrylamide quenching curves to characterize the environment of the residues. The analysis supports a model of adsorption that includes residues Leu 34 and Leu 36 on the 2nd loop, Tyr 55 and Tyr 59 on the 3rd loop and Ile 75 and Ile 79 on the 4th loop. The analysis confirms that Phe 84 is not part of the adsorption surface and likely stabilizes the conformation of colipase. Contrary to the predictions of computer modeling, the results provide strong support for an essential role of Tyr 55 in colipase adsorption to mixed micelles. The results indicate that the adsorption of colipase to mixed micelles is mediated by specific residues residing in a defined surface of colipase.

Abstract: Structural studies on pancreatic lipase have revealed a complex architecture of surface loops surrounding the enzyme active site and potentially involved in interactions with lipids. Two of them, the lid and β9 loop, expose a large hydrophobic surface and are considered as acyl chain binding sites based on their interaction with an alkyl phosphonate inhibitor. While the role of the lid in substrate recognition and selectivity has been extensively studied, the implication of β9 loop in acyl chain stabilization remained hypothetical. The characterization of an enzyme with a natural deletion of the lid, guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (GPLRP2), suggests however an essential contribution of the β9 loop in the stabilization of the acyl enzyme intermediate formed during the lipolysis reaction. A GPLRP2 mutant with a seven-residue deletion of β9 loop (GPLRP2-Δβ9) was produced and its enzyme activity was measured using various substrates (triglycerides, monoglycerides, galactolipids, phospholipids, vinyl esters) with short, medium and long acyl chains. Whatever the substrate tested, GPLRP2-Δβ9 activity is drastically reduced compared to that of wild-type GPLRP2 and this effect is more pronounced as the length of substrate acyl chain increases. Changes in relative substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity remained however weak. The deletion within β9 loop has also a negative effect on the rate of enzyme inhibition by alkyl phosphonates. All these findings indicate that the reduced enzyme turnover observed with GPLRP2-Δβ9 results from a weaker stabilization of the acyl enzyme intermediate due to a loss of hydrophobic interactions.

Abstract: Mammalian lipoxygenases belong to a family of lipid-peroxidizing enzymes, which have been implicated in cardiovascular, hyperproliferative and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report that a naturally occurring mutation in the hALOX15 gene leads to expression of a catalytically near-null enzyme variant (hGly422Glu). The inactivity may be related to severe misfolding of the enzyme protein, which was concluded from CD-spectra as well as from thermal and chemical stability assays. In silico mutagenesis experiments suggest that most mutations at hGly422 have the potential to induce sterical clash, which might be considered a reason for protein misfolding. hGly422 is conserved among ALOX5, ALOX12 and ALOX15 isoforms and corresponding hALOX12 and hALOX5 mutants also exhibited a reduced catalytic activity. Interestingly, in the hALOX5 Gly429Glu mutants the reaction specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation was shifted from 5S- to 8S- and 12R-H(p)ETE formation. Taken together, our data indicate that the conserved glycine is of functional importance for these enzyme variants and most mutants at this position lose catalytic activity.

Abstract: We recently characterized a nuclear import pathway for β-dystroglycan; however, its nuclear role remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time, the interaction of β-dystroglycan with distinct proteins from different nuclear compartments, including the nuclear envelope (NE) (emerin and lamins A/C and B1), splicing speckles (SC35), Cajal bodies (p80-coilin), and nucleoli (Nopp140). Electron microscopy analysis revealed that β-dystroglycan localized in the inner nuclear membrane, nucleoplasm, and nucleoli. Interestingly, downregulation of β-dystroglycan resulted in both mislocalization and decreased expression of emerin and lamin B1, but not lamin A/C, as well in disorganization of nucleoli, Cajal bodies, and splicing speckles with the concomitant decrease in the levels of Nopp140, and p80-coilin, but not SC35. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and cycloheximide-mediated protein arrest assays revealed that β-dystroglycan deficiency did not change mRNA expression of NE proteins emerin and lamin B1 bud did alter their stability, accelerating protein turnover. Furthermore, knockdown of β-dystroglycan disrupted NE-mediated processes including nuclear morphology and centrosome-nucleus linkage, which provides evidence that β-dystroglycan association with NE proteins is biologically relevant. Unexpectedly, β-dystroglycan-depleted cells exhibited multiple centrosomes, a characteristic of cancerous cells. Overall, these findings imply that β-dystroglycan is a nuclear scaffolding protein involved in nuclear organization and NE structure and function, and that might be a contributor to the biogenesis of nuclear envelopathies.

Abstract: The Eph receptors represent the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Both Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are cell-surface proteins, and they typically mediate cell-to-cell communication by interacting at sites of intercellular contact. The major aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of EphA4–ephrin-A1 interaction in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, as this process is a crucial step during the initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic plaque. Immunohistochemical analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques revealed expression of EphA4 receptor and ephrin-A1 ligand in major cell types within the plaque. Short-time stimulation of endothelial cells with the soluble ligand ephrin-A1 leads to a fourfold increase in adhesion of human monocytes to endothelial cells. In addition, ephrin-A1 further increases monocyte adhesion to already inflamed endothelial cells. EphrinA1 mediates its effect on monocyte adhesion via the activated receptor EphA4. This ephrinA1/EphA4 induced process involves the activation of the Rho signaling pathway and does not require active transcription. Rho activation downstream of EphA4 leads to increased polymerization of actin filaments in endothelial cells. This process was shown to be crucial for the proadhesive effect of ephrin-A1. The results of the present study show that ephrin-A1-induced EphA4 forward signaling promotes monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells via activation of RhoA and subsequent stress-fiber formation by a non-transcriptional mechanism.

Abstract: We previously reported that transplantation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) treated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhances capillary density in the myocardium and improves myocardial function in the ischemic heart. This effect may be mediated through the release of paracrine factors by MSC and potentially involves pro-angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, we examined the pharmacological and molecular regulation of VEGF secretion induced by LPA in rat MSCs. We showed that LPA stimulated VEGF secretion in MSCs but not in cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts. LPA-induced VEGF secretion occurred at the post-transcriptional levels and was mediated through the classical ER/Golgi-dependent protein secretory route. LPA also increased ORP150 protein expression. Inhibition of ORP150 upregulation by siRNA knockdown attenuated LPA-induced VEGF secretion. On the other hand, diazoxide, an activator of KATP channel, markedly inhibited LPA-induced ORP150 expression and VEGF secretion. Meanwhile, ATP concentration dependently increased VEGF secretion. In addition, l-Glutamate and NH4Cl significantly reduced VEGF secretion. Furthermore, inhibition of two major subtypes of LPA receptors by Ki16425 and specific siRNA for LPA receptors prevented LPA-induced VEGF secretion and ORP150 expression. Lastly, inhibition of Gi protein that couples with LPA receptors by PTX and siRNA knockdown had no effect on LPA-induced VEGF secretion. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LPA promotes VEGF secretion at the post-translation level by up-regulating ORP150 expression. Both LPA1 and LPA3 are involved in the LPA-induced VEGF secretion that is independent of Gi protein coupling but associated with the inactivation of KATP channels and inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer with a high incidence rate worldwide. One of the promising therapeutic approaches on breast cancer is to use the drugs that target the estrogen receptor (ER). In the present investigation, marmorin, a type I ribosome inactivating protein from the mushroom Hypsizigus marmoreus, inhibited the survival of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. It evinced more potent cytotoxicity toward estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells than ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Further study disclosed that marmorin undermined the expression level of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells induced by 17β-estradiol. Knockdown of ERα in MCF7 cells significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of marmorin on proliferation, suggesting that the ERα-mediated pathway was implicated in the suppressive action of marmorin on ER-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, marmorin induced time-dependent apoptosis in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. It brought about G2/M-phase arrest, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and caspase-9 activation in MCF7 cells, and to a lesser extent in MDA-MB-231 cells. Marmorin triggered the death receptor apoptotic pathway (e.g. caspase-8 activation) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS, as evidenced by phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1α, cleavage of caspase-12, and up-regulation of CHOP expression) in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, marmorin exhibited inhibitory effect on breast cancer partially via diminution of ERα and apoptotic pathways mediated by mitochondrial, death receptor and ERS. The results advocate that marmorin is a potential candidate for breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: To counteract genotoxic stress, DNA repair functions are in effect. Most of them are constitutively expressed while some of them can be up-regulated depending on the level of DNA damage. In human cells, only few DNA repair functions are subject of induction following DNA damage, and thus there is a need to identify and characterize inducible repair functions more thoroughly. Here, we provide evidence that the “three prime exonuclease I” (TREX1) is up-regulated in human fibroblasts and cancer cells on mRNA and protein level. Transcriptional upregulation of TREX1 was observed upon exposure to ultraviolet light and various anticancer drugs in glioma and malignant melanoma cells. Induction of TREX1 was found following treatment with the crosslinking alkylating agents nimustine, carmustine, fotemustine and the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, but not following temozolomide, etoposide and ionizing radiation. Induction of TREX1 following DNA damage requires the AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, as shown by siRNA knockdown, EMSA experiments, ChIP analysis and reporter assays with the TREX1 promoter and constructs harboring mutations in the AP-1 binding site. To analyze whether TREX1 expression impacts the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutics, TREX1 expression was down-regulated by siRNA in malignant glioma and melanoma cells. TREX1 knockdown resulted in enhanced cell death following nimustine, fotemustine and topotecan and to a reduced recovery from the anticancer drug induced block to replication. The data revealed that induction of TREX1 is a survival response evoked by various genotoxic anticancer drugs and identified TREX1 as a potential therapeutic target for anticancer therapy.

Abstract: The cardiac valves are targets of both congenital and acquired diseases. The formation of valves during embryogenesis (i.e., valvulogenesis) originates from endocardial cells lining the myocardium. These cells undergo an endothelial–mesenchymal transition, proliferate and migrate within an extracellular matrix. This leads to the formation of bilateral cardiac cushions in both the atrioventricular canal and the outflow tract. The embryonic origin of both the endocardium and prospective valve cells is still elusive. Endocardial and myocardial lineages are segregated early during embryogenesis and such a cell fate decision can be recapitulated in vitro by embryonic stem cells (ESC). Besides genetically modified mice and ex vivo heart explants, ESCs provide a cellular model to study the early steps of valve development and might constitute a human therapeutic cell source for decellularized tissue-engineered valves.

Abstract: TNFα can promote either cell survival or cell death. The activation of NF-κB plays a central role in cell survival while its inhibition makes TNFα-triggered cytotoxicity possible. Here, we report that the overexpression of a non-degradable mutant of the inhibitor of NF-κB (super-repressor (SR)-IκBα) sensitizes HeLa cells towards TNFα-induced apoptosis, involving caspases activation and cytocrome C release from the mitochondria. Interestingly, we describe that the specific knockdown of Bcl-xL, but not that of Bcl-2, Bcl-w or Mcl-1, renders cells sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis. This cytotoxic effect occurs without altering the activation of NF-κB. Then, the activation of the NF-κB pathway is not sufficient to protect Bcl-xL-downregulated cells from TNFα-induced cell death, meaning that TNFα is not able to promote cell survival in the absence of Bcl-xL. In addition, Bcl-xL silencing does not potentiate the cytotoxicity afforded by the cytokine in SR-IκBα-overexpressing cells. This indicates that TNFα-induced apoptosis in SR-IκBα-overexpressing cells relies on the protein levels of Bcl-xL. We have corroborated these findings using RD and DU-145 cells, which also become sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis after Bcl-xL knockdown despite that NF-κB remains activated. Altogether, our results point out that the impairment of the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL should make cells sensitive towards external insults circumventing the TNFα-triggered NF-κB-mediated cytoprotective effect. Hence, the specific inhibition of Bcl-xL could be envisaged as a promising alternative strategy against NF-κB-dependent highly chemoresistant proliferative malignancies.

Abstract: Protein kinase CK2 is a pleiotropic enzyme, which is implicated in the regulation of numerous biological processes. It seems to regulate the various functions by binding to other proteins and by phosphorylation of many different substrates. Here, we identified the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an essential component of the ER stress signaling, as a new binding partner and a new substrate of CK2 in vitro and in vivo. Bifluorescence complementation analysis (BiFC) revealed that CK2α and ATF4 associate in the nucleus. By using mutants of ATF4 we identified serine 215 as the main CK2 phosphorylation site. The ATF4 S215A mutant turned out to be more stable than the wild-type form. We further noticed that an inhibition of CK2 caused an increased transcription of the ATF4 gene. Analyses of the transcription factor activity revealed an impaired activity of the CK2 phosphorylation mutant of ATF4. Thus, we show that (i) ATF4 is a binding partner of CK2α (ii) ATF4 is a substrate of CK2, (iii) the phosphorylation of ATF4 by CK2 influences the stability of ATF4, (iv) the transcription of ATF4 is regulated by CK2 and (v) the transcription factor activity of ATF4 is regulated by the CK2 phosphorylation of ATF4. Thus, CK2 plays an essential role in the regulation of the ER-stress induced signaling pathway.

Abstract: Efficient dietary fat digestion is essential for newborns who consume more dietary fat per body weight than at any other time of life. In many mammalian newborns, pancreatic lipase related protein 2 (PLRP2) is the predominant duodenal lipase. Pigs may be an exception since PLRP2 expression has been documented in the intestine but not in the pancreas. Because of the differences in tissue-specific expression, we hypothesized that the kinetic properties of porcine PLRP2 would differ from those of other mammals. To characterize its properties, recombinant porcine PLRP2 was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified to homogeneity. Porcine PLRP2 had activity against tributyrin, trioctanoin and triolein. The activity was not inhibited by bile salts and colipase, which is required for the activity of pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL), minimally stimulated PLRP2 activity. Similar to PLRP2 from other species, PLRP2 from pigs had activity against galactolipids and phospholipids. Importantly, porcine PLRP2 hydrolyzed a variety of dietary substrates including pasteurized human mother's milk and infant formula and its activity was comparable to that of PTL. In conclusion, porcine PLRP2 has broad substrate specificity and has high triglyceride lipase activity even in the absence of colipase. The data suggest that porcine PLRP2 would be a suitable lipase for inclusion in recombinant preparations for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

Abstract: Fatty acid β-oxidation may occur in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. While peroxisomes oxidize specific carboxylic acids such as very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and fatty dicarboxylic acids, mitochondria oxidize long-, medium-, and short-chain fatty acids. Oxidation of long-chain substrates requires the carnitine shuttle for mitochondrial access but medium-chain fatty acid oxidation is generally considered carnitine-independent. Using control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)- and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-deficient human fibroblasts, we investigated the oxidation of lauric acid (C12:0). Measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium revealed significantly elevated levels of extracellular C10- and C12-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient fibroblasts. The accumulation of C12-carnitine indicates that lauric acid also uses the carnitine shuttle to access mitochondria. Moreover, the accumulation of extracellular C10-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells suggests an extramitochondrial pathway for the oxidation of lauric acid. Indeed, in the absence of peroxisomes C10-carnitine is not produced, proving that this intermediate is a product of peroxisomal β-oxidation. In conclusion, when the carnitine shuttle is impaired lauric acid is partly oxidized in peroxisomes. This peroxisomal oxidation could be a compensatory mechanism to metabolize straight medium- and long-chain fatty acids, especially in cases of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation deficiency or overload.

Abstract: The molecular lipid composition of exosomes is largely unknown. In this study, sophisticated shotgun and targeted molecular lipidomic assays were performed for in-depth analysis of the lipidomes of the metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, and their released exosomes. This study, based in the quantification of approximately 280 molecular lipid species, provides the most extensive lipid analysis of cells and exosomes to date. Interestingly, major differences were found in the lipid composition of exosomes compared to parent cells. Exosomes show a remarkable enrichment of distinct lipids, demonstrating an extraordinary discrimination of lipids sorted into these microvesicles. In particular, exosomes are highly enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and phosphatidylserine (mol% of total lipids). Furthermore, lipid species, even of classes not enriched in exosomes, were selectively included in exosomes. Finally, it was found that there is an 8.4-fold enrichment of lipids per mg of protein in exosomes. The detailed lipid composition provided in this study may be useful to understand the mechanism of exosome formation, release and function. Several of the lipids enriched in exosomes could potentially be used as cancer biomarkers.

Lysine methyltransferase Smyd2 regulates Hsp90-mediated protection of the sarcomeric titin springs and cardiac function,

Abstract: Protein lysine methylation controls gene expression and repair of deoxyribonucleic acid in the nucleus but also occurs in the cytoplasm, where the role of this posttranslational modification is less understood. Members of the Smyd protein family of lysine methyltransferases are particularly abundant in the cytoplasm, with Smyd1 and Smyd2 being most highly expressed in the heart and in skeletal muscles. Smyd1 is a crucial myogenic regulator with histone methyltransferase activity but also associates with myosin, which promotes sarcomere assembly. Smyd2 methylates histones and non-histone proteins, such as the tumor suppressors, p53 and retinoblastoma protein, RB. Smyd2 has an intriguing function in the cytoplasm of skeletal myocytes, where it methylates the chaperone Hsp90, thus promoting the interaction of a Smyd2–methyl-Hsp90 complex with the N2A-domain of titin. This complex protects the sarcomeric I-band region and myocyte organization. We briefly summarize some novel functions of Smyd family members, with a focus on Smyd2, and highlight their role in striated muscles and cytoplasmic actions. We then provide experimental evidence that Smyd2 is also important for cardiac function. In the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes, Smyd2 was found to associate with the sarcomeric I-band region at the titin N2A-domain. Binding to N2A occurred in vitro and in yeast via N-terminal and extreme C-terminal regions of Smyd2. Smyd2-knockdown in zebrafish using an antisense oligonucleotide morpholino approach strongly impaired cardiac performance. We conclude that Smyd2 and presumably several other Smyd family members are lysine methyltransferases which have, next to their nuclear activity, specific regulatory functions in the cytoplasm of heart and skeletal muscle cells.

Abstract: Microspherule protein Msp58 (or MCRS1) plays a role in numerous cellular processes including transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation. It is not well understood either how Msp58 mediates its myriad functions or how it is itself regulated. Here, by immunoprecipitation, we identify EDD (E3 identified by differential display) as a novel Msp58-interacting protein. EDD, also called UBR5, is a HECT-domain (homologous to E6-AP carboxy-terminus) containing ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and DNA damage response. Both in vitro and in vivo binding assays show that Msp58 directly interacts with EDD. Microscopy studies reveal that these two proteins co-localize in the nucleus. We have also found that depletion of EDD leads to an increase of Msp58 protein level and extends the half-life of Msp58, demonstrating that EDD negatively regulates Msp58's protein stability. Furthermore, we show that Msp58 is upregulated in multiple different cell lines upon the treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and exogenously expressed Msp58 is ubiquitinated, suggesting that Msp58 is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Finally, knockdown of either Msp58 or EDD in human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells affects the levels of cyclins B, D and E, as well as cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest a role for the Msp58/EDD interaction in controlling cell cycle progression. Given that both Msp58 and EDD are often aberrantly expressed in various human cancers, our findings open a new direction to elucidate Msp58 and EDD's roles in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) can moderate oxidative stress by favoring the influx of protons into the mitochondrial matrix, thus reducing electron leakage from respiratory chain and mitochondrial superoxide production. Here, we demonstrate that UCP2 inhibition by genipin or UCP2 siRNA strongly increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production inhibiting pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth. We also show that UCP2 inhibition triggers ROS-dependent nuclear translocation of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), formation of autophagosomes, and the expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II. Consistently, UCP2 over-expression significantly reduces basal autophagy confirming the anti-autophagic role of UCP2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autophagy induced by UCP2 inhibition determines a ROS-dependent cell death, as indicated by the apoptosis decrease in the presence of the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), or the radical scavenger NAC. Intriguingly, the autophagy induced by genipin is able to potentiate the autophagic cell death triggered by gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on UCP2 inhibition associated to standard chemotherapy. Our results demonstrate for the first time that UCP2 plays a role in autophagy regulation bringing new insights into mitochondrial uncoupling protein field.

Abstract: Transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) enhances cell migration and invasion, although how TM4SF5 mechanistically mediates these effects remains unknown. In the study, during efforts to understand TM4SF5-mediated signal transduction, TM4SF5 was shown to bind c-Src and thus hepatoma cell lines expressing TM4SF5 were analyzed for the significance of the interaction in cell invasion. The C-terminus of TM4SF5 bound both inactive c-Src that might be sequestered to certain cellular areas and active c-Src that might form invasive protrusions. Wildtype (WT) TM4SF5 expression enhanced migration and invasive protrusion formation in a c-Src-dependent manner, compared with TM4SF5-null control hepatoma cell lines. However, tailless TM4SF5ΔC cells were more efficient than WT TM4SF5 cells, suggesting a negative regulatory role by the C-terminus. TM4SF5 WT- or TM4SF5ΔC-mediated formation of invasive protrusions was dependent or independent on serum or epidermal growth factor treatment, respectively, although they both were dependent on c-Src. The c-Src activity of TM4SF5 WT- or TM4SF5ΔC-expressing cells correlated with enhanced Tyr845 phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Y845F EGFR mutation abolished the TM4SF5-mediated invasive protrusions, but not c-Src phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that TM4SF5 modulates c-Src activity during TM4SF5-mediated invasion through a TM4SF5/c-Src/EGFR signaling pathway, differentially along the leading protrusive edges of an invasive cancer cell.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) overexpression in malignant cells has been reported. Mouse Friend cells showed higher SPHK1 but not SPHK2 expression compared with other mouse cell lines. A Sphk1 promoter analysis demonstrated the region between −53bp and the first exon as the minimal promoter. Further promoter truncation revealed the importance of a MYB-binding site. EMSA using this region as the probe demonstrated one band containing c-MYB protein, and its intensity decreased during erythroid differentiation with hexamethylane bisacetamide (HMBA), a potent inducer of erythroid differentiation of Friend cells. ChIP assay also revealed in vivo binding of c-MYB. c-MYB overexpression and siRNA for c-Myb affected SPHK1 expression, confirming the important regulatory role of c-MYB in SPHK1 expression. HMBA reduced c-MYB expression rapidly. Induced differentiation by HMBA caused a marked and rapid reduction of SPHK1 mRNA, protein and enzyme activity leading to the rapid decrease of cellular sphingosine 1-phosphate level. Moreover, terminally differentiated cells did not resume SPHK1 expression. Compared with original Friend cells, stable overexpression of wild-type SPHK1 showed higher cell proliferation, resistance to cell death by serum depletion. Interestingly, HMBA-induced differentiation of these cells was delayed but not completely suppressed. In contrast, SPHK inhibitor and its siRNA inhibited cell growth and enhanced HMBA-induced differentiation significantly, suggesting that SPHK1 delayed HMBA-induced differentiation by its cell proliferation-promoting activity. Effects of pertussis toxin, a G-protein-coupled receptor inhibitor, and S1P receptor antagonist on Friend cell growth and differentiation were negligible, suggesting the importance of the intracellular SPHK1/S1P signaling in Friend cells.

Abstract: Constitutive phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) is a common feature of cancer caused by genetic alteration in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene and is associated with poor prognosis. This study determined the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) in AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PTEN-null/mutated prostate cancer cells. Doxycycline (Dox)-induced expression of cPLA2α led to an increase in pAKT, pGSK3β and cyclin D1 levels in LNCaP cells that possess a PTEN frame-shift mutation. In contrast, silencing cPLA2α expression with siRNA decreased pAKT, pGSK3β and cyclin D1 levels in both PC-3 (PTEN deletion) and LNCaP cells. Silencing of cPLA2α decreased pERK and AR protein levels. The inhibitory effect of cPLA2α siRNA on pAKT and AR protein levels was reduced by the addition of arachidonic acid (AA), whereas the stimulatory effect of AA on pAKT, pERK and AR levels was decreased by an inhibitor of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Pharmacological blockade of cPLA2α with Efipladib reduced pAKT and AR levels with a concomitant inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell proliferation. These results demonstrate an important role for cPLA2α in sustaining AKT, ERK and AR signaling in PTEN-null/mutated prostate cancer cells and provide a potential molecular target for treating prostate cancer.

Abstract: Neuronal sphingolipids (SL) play important roles during axonal extension, neurotrophic receptor signaling and neurotransmitter release. Many of these signaling pathways depend on the presence of specialized membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts. Sphingomyelin (SM), one of the main raft constituents, can be formed de novo or supplied from exogenous sources. The present study aimed to characterize fluorescently-labeled SL turnover in a murine neuronal cell line (CATH.a). Our results demonstrate that at 4°C exogenously added BODIPY-SM accumulates exclusively at the plasma membrane. Treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) and back-exchange experiments revealed that 55–67% of BODIPY-SM resides in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of BODIPY-SM occurs via caveolae with part of internalized BODIPY-fluorescence ending up in the Golgi and the ER. Following endocytosis BODIPY-SM undergoes hydrolysis, a reaction substantially faster than BODIPY-SM synthesis from BODIPY-ceramide. RNAi demonstrated that both, acid (a)SMase and neutral (n)SMases contribute to BODIPY-SM hydrolysis. Finally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated BODIPY-SM was efficiently taken up by CATH.a cells. Our findings indicate that endocytosis of exogenous SM occurs almost exclusively via caveolin-dependent pathways, that both, a- and nSMases equally contribute to neuronal SM turnover and that HDL-like particles might represent physiological SM carriers/donors in the brain.

Abstract: Increased triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes caused by a misbalance between energy intake and energy consumption, results in increased adipocyte size, excess adipose tissue, increased body weight and ultimately, obesity. It is well established that enlarged adipocytes exhibit malfunctions that contribute to whole body insulin resistance, a key factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying molecular cause for dysfunctional adipocyte behavior and signaling is poorly understood. Since the adipocyte cell surface proteome, or surfaceome, represents the cellular signaling gateway to the microenvironment, we studied the contribution of this subproteome to adipocyte malfunctions in obesity. By using the chemoproteomic Cell Surface Capture (CSC) technology, we established surfaceome maps of primary adipocytes derived from different mouse models for metabolic disorders. Relative quantitative comparison between these surfaceome maps revealed a set of cell surface glycoproteins with modulated location-specific abundance levels. RNAi mediated targeting of a subset of the detected obesity modulated cell surface glycoproteins in an in vitro model system provided functional evidence for their role in adiponectin secretion and the lipolytic activity of adipocytes. Thus, we conclude that the identified cell surface glycoproteins which exhibit obesity induced abundance changes and impact adipocyte function at the same time contribute to adipocyte malfunction in obesity. The regulation of their concerted activities could improve adipocyte function in obesity.

Abstract: In yeast like in many other eukaryotes, fatty acids are stored in the biologically inert form of triacylglycerols (TG) and steryl esters (SE) as energy reserve and/or as membrane building blocks. In the present study, we identified gene products catalyzing formation of TG and SE in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Based on sequence homologies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two diacylglycerol acyltransferases Dga1p and Lro1p and one acyl CoA:sterol acyltransferase Are2p from P. pastoris were identified. Mutants bearing single and multiple deletions of the respective genes were analyzed for their growth phenotype, lipid composition and the ability to form lipid droplets. Our results indicate that the above mentioned gene products are most likely responsible for the entire TG and SE synthesis in P. pastoris. Lro1p which has low fatty acid substrate specificity in vivo is the major TG synthase in this yeast, whereas Dga1p contributes less to TG synthesis although with some preference to utilize polyunsaturated fatty acids as substrates. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, Are2p is the only SE synthase in P. pastoris. Also this enzyme exhibits some preference for certain fatty acids as judged from the fatty acid profile of SE compared to bulk lipids. Most interestingly, TG formation in P. pastoris is indispensable for lipid droplet biogenesis. The small amount of SE synthesized by Are2p in a dga1∆lro1∆ double deletion mutant is insufficient to initiate the formation of the storage organelle. In summary, our data provide a first insight into the molecular machinery of non-polar lipid synthesis and storage in P. pastoris and demonstrate specific features of this machinery in comparison to other eukaryotic cells, especially S. cerevisiae.

Abstract: Obesity is associated with an increased risk for malignant lymphoma development. We used Bcr/Abl transformed B cells to determine the impact of aggressive lymphoma formation on systemic lipid mobilization and turnover. In wild-type mice, tumor size significantly correlated with depletion of white adipose tissues (WAT), resulting in increased serum free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations which promote B-cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, B-cell tumor development induced hepatic lipid accumulation due to enhanced hepatic fatty acid (FA) uptake and impaired FA oxidation. Serum triglyceride, FFA, phospholipid and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated. Consistently, serum VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were drastically increased. These findings suggest that B-cell tumors trigger systemic lipid mobilization from WAT to the liver and increase VLDL/LDL release from the liver to promote tumor growth. Further support for this concept stems from experiments where we used the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist and lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate that significantly suppressed tumor growth independent of angiogenesis and inflammation. In addition to WAT depletion, fenofibrate further stimulated FFA uptake by the liver and restored hepatic FA oxidation capacity, thereby accelerating the clearance of lipids released from WAT. Furthermore, fenofibrate blocked hepatic lipid release induced by the tumors. In contrast, lipid utilization in the tumor tissue itself was not increased by fenofibrate which correlates with extremely low expression levels of PPARα in B-cells. Our data show that fenofibrate associated effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and deprivation of serum lipids are capable to suppress B-cell lymphoma growth which may direct novel treatment strategies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.

Abstract: Cleavage of Rho associated Coiled Coil kinase I (ROCK I) by caspase-3 contributes to membrane blebbing. Whether caspase-3 and ROCK I also play a role in the release of membrane vesicles is unknown. Therefore, we transfected a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) that is caspase-3 deficient, lacks membrane blebbing, and does not release membrane vesicles, with caspase-3. Cells expressing caspase-3 demonstrate both ROCK I-mediated membrane blebbing, and release of small (400–600nm) membrane vesicles in a ROCK I-independent manner. These membrane vesicles contain caspase-3, and are enriched in caspase-3 activity compared to the releasing cells. Caspase-3-containing vesicles are taken up by untransfected cells but the cells do not show any sign of apoptosis. In conclusion, we show that the release of caspase-3-enriched membrane vesicles and membrane blebbing are two differentially regulated processes. Furthermore, we hypothesize that packaging of caspase-3 into membrane vesicles contributes to cellular homeostasis by the removal of caspase-3, and concurrently, protects the cells' environment from direct exposure to caspase-3 activity.
