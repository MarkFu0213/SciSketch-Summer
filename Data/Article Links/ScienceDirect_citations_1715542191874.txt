Abstract: The small heat shock protein HSPB8 and its co-chaperone BAG3 are proposed to regulate cytoskeletal proteostasis in response to mechanical signaling in muscle cells. Here, we show that in dividing cells, the HSPB8-BAG3 complex is instrumental to the accurate disassembly of the actin-based contractile ring during cytokinesis, a process required to allow abscission of daughter cells. Silencing of HSPB8 markedly decreased the mitotic levels of BAG3 in HeLa cells, supporting its crucial role in BAG3 mitotic functions. Cells depleted of HSPB8 were delayed in cytokinesis, remained connected via a disorganized intercellular bridge, and exhibited increased incidence of nuclear abnormalities that result from failed cytokinesis (i.e., bi- and multi-nucleation). Such phenotypes were associated with abnormal accumulation of F-actin at the intercellular bridge of daughter cells at telophase. Remarkably, the actin sequestering drug latrunculin A, like the inhibitor of branched actin polymerization CK666, normalized F-actin during cytokinesis and restored proper cell division in HSPB8-depleted cells, implicating deregulated actin dynamics as a cause of abscission failure. Moreover, this HSPB8-dependent phenotype could be corrected by rapamycin, an autophagy-promoting drug, whereas it was mimicked by drugs impairing lysosomal function. Together, the results further support a role for the HSPB8-BAG3 chaperone complex in quality control of actin-based structure dynamics that are put under high tension, notably during cell cytokinesis. They expand a so-far under-appreciated connection between selective autophagy and cellular morphodynamics that guide cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral malaria is a deadly outcome of infection by Plasmodium falciparum, occurring when parasite-infected erythrocytes accumulate in the brain. These erythrocytes display parasite proteins of the PfEMP1 family that bind various endothelial receptors. Despite the importance of cerebral malaria, a binding phenotype linked to its symptoms has not been identified. Here, we used structural biology to determine how a group of PfEMP1 proteins interacts with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), allowing us to predict binders from a specific sequence motif alone. Analysis of multiple Plasmodium falciparum genomes showed that ICAM-1-binding PfEMP1s also interact with endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), allowing infected erythrocytes to synergistically bind both receptors. Expression of these PfEMP1s, predicted to bind both ICAM-1 and EPCR, is associated with increased risk of developing cerebral malaria. This study therefore reveals an important PfEMP1-binding phenotype that could be targeted as part of a strategy to prevent cerebral malaria.

Abstract: Summary
Artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) are frontline antimalarial drugs. However, ART monotherapy is associated with a high frequency of recrudescent infection, resulting in treatment failure. A subset of parasites is thought to undergo ART-induced latency, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that ART treatment results in phosphorylation of the parasite eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), leading to repression of general translation and latency induction. Enhanced phosphorylated eIF2α correlates with high rates of recrudescence following ART, and inhibiting eIF2α dephosphorylation renders parasites less sensitive to ART treatment. ART-induced eIF2α phosphorylation is mediated by the Plasmodium eIF2α kinase, PK4. Overexpression of a PK4 dominant-negative or pharmacological inhibition of PK4 blocks parasites from entering latency and abolishes recrudescence after ART treatment of infected mice. These results show that translational control underlies ART-induced latency and that interference with this stress response may resolve the clinical problem of recrudescent infection.

Abstract: There are different views of how the immune system participates in the reaction to cancer. Here, we evaluated expression of DAMP proteins HSP70 and cancer-testis antigen SPAG9 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer to explore tumor immunity. Our analysis showed that levels of HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in the serum of lung cancer and HCC patients than in the serum of healthy subjects (P < 0.001), but there were no differences in levels of HSP70 antibody in patients and controls. Levels of serum SPAG9 antibody in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients were significantly higher than in treated lung cancer patients (P < 0.05), but there were no differences in levels of HSP70 or HSP70 antibody. Levels of serum HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody, but not HSP70 antibody, were also higher in hepatitis/cirrhosis patients than in healthy subjects (P = 0.005, P < 0.001). Levels of serum SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in HCC patients than in hepatitis/cirrhosis patients, but there were no differences in HSP70 or HSP70 antibody levels. Finally, levels of serum HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in HCC patients than in lung cancer patients (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). These results indicate that cancer-testis antigen SPAG9 induces a strong humoral immune response in cancer patients but HSP70 does not. These results show that SPAG9 has potential as a tumor-specific biomarker.

Abstract: CLEC16A is genetically linked with multiple autoimmune disorders but its functional relevance in autoimmunity remains obscure. Recent evidence has signposted the emerging role of autophagy in autoimmune disease development. Here, by ectopic expression and siRNA silencing, we show that CLEC16A has an inhibitory role in starvation-induced autophagy in human cells. Combining quantitative proteomics and immunoblotting analyses, we found that CLEC16A likely regulates autophagy by activating mTOR pathway. Overexpression of CLEC16A was found to sensitize cells towards the availability of nutrients, resulting in a heightened mTOR activity, which in turn diminished LC3 autophagic activity following nutrient deprivation. CLEC16A deficiency, on the other hand, delayed mTOR activity in response to nutrient sensing, thereby resulted in an augmented autophagic response. CLEC16A was found residing in cytosolic vesicles and the Golgi, and nutrient removal promoted a stronger clustering within the Golgi, where it was possibly in a vantage position to activate mTOR upon nutrient replenishment. These findings suggest that Golgi-associated CLEC16A negatively regulates autophagy via modulation of mTOR activity, and may provide support for a functional link between CLEC16A and autoimmunity.

Abstract: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bacterial pathogens, which not only affect connective tissue attachments but also cause alveolar bone loss. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs) under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. Proliferation levels were measured by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU). Osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization were investigated using chromogenic alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) activity substrate assays, Alizarin red S staining, and RT-PCR analysis of HBMSCs osteogenic marker expression. Oxidative stress induced by LPS was investigated by assaying reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Here, we demonstrated that HAMSCs increased the proliferation, osteoblastic differentiation, and SOD activity of LPS-induced HBMSCs, and down-regulated the ROS level. Moreover, our results suggested that the activation of p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway is essential for reversing the LPS-induced bone-destructive processes. SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK signaling, significantly suppressed the anti-inflammatory effects in HAMSCs. In conclusion, HAMSCs show a strong potential in treating inflammation-induced bone loss by influencing p38 MAPK signaling.

Abstract: One of the appeals of the zebrafish model is the relative ease of studying disease progression from embryonic or larval stages through to adulthood. Because of this, the zebrafish has become an important model for postembryonic pancreatic disease, particularly diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Here we present methods for using the adult zebrafish to analyze pancreas function and structure, with an emphasis on the endocrine pancreas and the beta cells. The methods include fasting, weighing adults, and anesthetizing adults, and intraperitoneal injection of glucose based on body weight. We also present dissection methods for removing the pancreas intact for histological studies and for sterile dissection of the principal islet followed by dissociation for cell culture-based studies of beta-cell function.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and immunosuppression-related lymphomas. These B cell malignancies arise by distinct transformation pathways and have divergent viral and host expression programs. To identify host dependency factors resulting from these EBV+, B cell-transformed cell states, we performed parallel genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens in BL and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These highlighted 57 BL and 87 LCL genes uniquely important for their growth and survival. LCL hits were enriched for EBV-induced genes, including viral super-enhancer targets. Our systematic approach uncovered key mechanisms by which EBV oncoproteins activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and evade tumor suppressor responses. LMP1-induced cFLIP was found to be critical for LCL defense against TNFα-mediated programmed cell death, whereas EBV-induced BATF/IRF4 were critical for BIM suppression and MYC induction in LCLs. Finally, EBV super-enhancer-targeted IRF2 protected LCLs against Blimp1-mediated tumor suppression. Our results identify viral transformation-driven synthetic lethal targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Transport of therapeutic agents across epithelial barriers is an important element in drug delivery. Transepithelial flux is widely used as a measure of transit across an epithelium, however it is most typically employed as a relative as opposed to absolute measure of molecular movement. Here, we have used the calcium switch approach to measure the maximum rate of paracellular flux through unencumbered intercellular junctions as a method to calibrate the flux rates for a series of tracers ranging in 0.6–900kDa in size across barriers composed of human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells. We then examined the effects of nanostructured films (NSFs) on transepithelial transport. Two different NSF patterns were used, Defined Nanostructure (DN) 2 imprinted on polypropylene (PP) and DN3 imprinted on polyether ether ketone (PEEK). NSFs made direct contact with cells and decreased their barrier function, as measured by transepithelial resistance (TER), however cell viability was not affected. When NSF-induced transepithelial transport of Fab fragment (55kDa) and IgG (160kDa) was measured, it was unexpectedly found to be significantly greater than the maximum paracellular rate as predicted using cells cultured in low calcium. These data suggested that NSFs stimulate an active transport pathway, most likely transcytosis, in addition to increasing paracellular flux. Transport of IgG via transcytosis was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, since NSFs induced a significant level of IgG endocytosis by Caco-2 cells. Thus, NSF-induced IgG flux was attributable to both transcytosis and the paracellular route. These data provide the first demonstration that transcytosis can be stimulated by NSFs and that this was concurrent with increased paracellular permeability. Moreover, NSFs with distinct architecture paired with specific substrates have the potential to provide an effective means to regulate transepithelial transport in order to optimize drug delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Enzymes of central carbon metabolism are essential mediators of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and pathogenicity, but are often perceived to lack sufficient species selectivity to be pursued as potential drug targets. Fumarase (Fum) is an enzyme of the canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle and is dispensable in many organisms. Transposon mutagenesis studies in Mtb, however, indicate that Fum is required for optimal growth. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a genetically engineered Mtb strain in which Fum expression is conditionally regulated. This revealed that Fum deficiency is bactericidal in vitro and during both the acute and chronic phases of mouse infection. This essentiality is linked to marked accumulations of fumarate resulting in protein and metabolite succination, a covalent modification of cysteine thiol residues. These results identify Mtb Fum as a potentially species-specific drug target whose inactivation may kill Mtb through a covalently irreversible form of metabolic toxicity.

Abstract: Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is the process of maintaining the conformational and functional integrity of the proteome. Proteostasis is preserved in the face of stress by a complex network of cellular machinery, including the small heat shock molecular chaperone proteins (sHsps), which act to inhibit the aggregation and deposition of misfolded protein intermediates. Despite this, the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases has been inextricably linked with the amyloid fibrillar aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn). The sHsps are potent inhibitors of α-syn aggregation in vitro. However, the limited availability of a robust, cell-based model of α-syn aggregation has, thus far, restricted evaluation of sHsp efficacy in the cellular context. As such, this work sought to establish a robust model of intracellular α-syn aggregation using Neuro-2a cells. Aggregation of α-syn was found to be sensitive to inhibition of autophagy and the proteasome, resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of cells containing α-syn inclusions. This model was then used to evaluate the capacity of the sHsps, αB-c and Hsp27, to prevent α-syn aggregation in cells. To do so, we used bicistronic expression plasmids to express the sHsps. Unlike traditional fluorescent fusion constructs, these bicistronic expression plasmids enable only individual transfected cells expressing the sHsps (via expression of the fluorescent reporter) to be analysed, but without the need to tag the sHsp, which can affect its oligomeric structure and chaperone activity. Overexpression of both αB-c and Hsp27 significantly reduced the intracellular aggregation of α-syn. Thus, these findings suggest that overexpressing or boosting the activity of sHsps may be a way of preventing amyloid fibrillar aggregation of α-syn in the context of neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are required to establish immune tolerance to commensal microbes. Tregs accumulate abruptly in the skin during a defined window of postnatal tissue development. However, the mechanisms mediating Treg migration to neonatal skin are unknown. Here we show that hair follicle (HF) development facilitates the accumulation of Tregs in neonatal skin and that upon skin entry these cells localize to HFs, a primary reservoir for skin commensals. Further, germ-free neonates had reduced skin Tregs indicating that commensal microbes augment Treg accumulation. We identified Ccl20 as a HF-derived, microbiota-dependent chemokine and found its receptor, Ccr6, to be preferentially expressed by Tregs in neonatal skin. The Ccl20-Ccr6 pathway mediated Treg migration in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HF morphogenesis, commensal microbe colonization, and local chemokine production work in concert to recruit Tregs into neonatal skin, thereby establishing this tissue Treg niche early in life.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) are some of the clinically most successful anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, instances of multidrug resistances to MTA have been reported, which highlights the need for developing MTAs with different mechanistic properties. One less explored class of MTAs are [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (TPs). These cytotoxic compounds are microtubule-stabilizing agents that inexplicably bind to vinblastine binding site on tubulin, which is typically targeted by microtubule-destabilizing agents. Here we used cellular, biochemical, and structural biology approaches to address this apparent discrepancy. Our results establish TPs as vinca-site microtubule-stabilizing agents that promote longitudinal tubulin contacts in microtubules, in contrast to classical microtubule-stabilizing agents that primarily promote lateral contacts. Additionally we observe that TPs studied here are not affected by p-glycoprotein overexpression, and suggest that TPs are promising ligands against multidrug-resistant cancer cells.

Abstract: Hypoxia causes dramatic changes in the expression profiles of genes that encode glycolytic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factors, erythropoietin, and other factors in a tissue-specific manner through activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) such as HIF1α and HIF2α. It has been elucidated that the activity of HIFs is fundamentally regulated by their protein stability in an oxygen-dependent manner. However, little is known about how stabilized HIFs regulate transcription of their target genes in hypoxic cells. Additionally, the roles of HIF3α, the third member of the HIFs, are still enigma due to its various splicing variants and the complicated phenotypes of Hif3a-gene modified mouse lines. Here, we summarize how molecular systems fine-tune hypoxia-inducible transcription with the cooperation of HIFs and their negative regulators, including IPAS, one of the HIF3α splicing variants. Since epigenetic mechanisms contribute to stress-inducible and cell-type specific gene regulation, the HIF-dependent reorganization of nucleosome structures in hypoxia-inducible gene promoters is also discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neurogenesis requires the precise control of neuronal versus astrocyte lineage determination in neural stem cells. While microRNAs (miRNAs) are critically involved in this step during development, their actions in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (aNSCs) has been unclear. As entry point to address that question we chose DICER, an endoribonuclease essential for miRNA biogenesis and other RNAi-related processes. By specific ablation of Dicer in aNSCs in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate that miRNAs are required for the generation of new neurons, but not astrocytes, in the adult murine hippocampus. Moreover, we identify 11 miRNAs, of which 9 have not been previously characterized in neurogenesis, that determine neurogenic lineage fate choice of aNSCs at the expense of astrogliogenesis. Finally, we propose that the 11 miRNAs sustain adult hippocampal neurogenesis through synergistic modulation of 26 putative targets from different pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The truncated mutant form of the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) is causative for frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD3). CHMP2B is a constituent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and, when mutated, disrupts endosome-to-lysosome trafficking and substrate degradation. To understand the underlying molecular pathology, FTD3 patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into forebrain-type cortical neurons. FTD3 neurons exhibited abnormal endosomes, as previously shown in patients. Moreover, mitochondria of FTD3 neurons displayed defective cristae formation, accompanied by deficiencies in mitochondrial respiration and increased levels of reactive oxygen. In addition, we provide evidence for perturbed iron homeostasis, presenting an in vitro patient-specific model to study the effects of iron accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases. All phenotypes observed in FTD3 neurons were rescued in CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic controls. These findings illustrate the relevance of our patient-specific in vitro models and open up possibilities for drug target development.

Abstract: Professor Lorenz Poellinger (Karolinska Institute/Cancer Science Institute of Singapore) passed away in March 2016. Then hypoxic research field lost a noble and unique researcher when he died, since he had contributed very much to this field in a variety of aspects. We had been collaborating on a various research projects of genomic analyses of HIF-signaling pathway for a long time, and recently reported several interesting results with HIF-α genes (HIF1A, EPAS1 and HIF3A). Genomics/Genetics is a still growing field, with new technologies appearing often, and many groups have performed extensive genomic/genetic analyses. In this review, I thus focused on the genetics of HIF-α genes in human cancers. I deeply mourn Professor Poellinger's loss and dedicate this review to him.

Abstract: Summary
Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), the main constituent of PML nuclear bodies, regulates various physiological processes in different cell types. However, little is known about its functions in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Here, we report that PML contributes to ESC self-renewal maintenance by controlling cell-cycle progression and sustaining the expression of crucial pluripotency factors. Transcriptomic analysis and gain- or loss-of-function approaches showed that PML-deficient ESC exhibit morphological, metabolic, and growth properties distinct to naive and closer to the primed pluripotent state. During differentiation of embryoid bodies, PML influences cell-fate decisions between mesoderm and endoderm by controlling the expression of Tbx3. PML loss compromises the reprogramming ability of embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting the transforming growth factor β pathway at the very early stages. Collectively, these results designate PML as a member of the regulatory network for ESC naive pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Lipoxin A4 (LXA4; 5S, 6R, 15Strihydroxy- 7,9,13-trans-11-eicosatetraenoic acid) is a metabolic product of arachidonic acid under the action of lipoxidase. This lipid molecule plays important roles in several biological functions, especially inflammatory processes. In vivo, LXA4 regulates the inflammatory response through several signaling pathways. Its mechanism suggests that it might have an effect on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. Using both in vitro and in vivo studies, it was here observed that LXA4 could significantly inhibit the formation and function of osteoclasts and these effects could be blocked by Boc-2, the specific inhibitor of FPR2/ALX (the receptor of LXA4). Meanwhile, LXA4 reduce the amount of ovariectomy-induced bone loss. These protective effects was found to be associated with inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), PI3K-AKT, and p-38, ERK, and JNK in MAPKs. The expression of the receptor activator of the NF-κB ligand RANKL:osteoprotegerin ratio and serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were decreased by LXA4. Moreover, LXA4 prevented the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the expression of osteoclast-specific genes, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CK), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, RANK, and osteoclastic related transcription factors of c-Fos, NFATc1 could also be significantly inhibited by LXA4 in a dose-dependent manner. Studies have demonstrated that LXA4 can inhibit the formation and function of osteoclasts through modulation of several pathways both upstream and downstream of RANKL signaling and FPR2/ALX was involved in the procedures. This shows that LXA4 may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases.

Abstract: ROR-alpha is a nuclear receptor, activity of which can be modulated by natural or synthetic ligands. Due to its possible involvement in, and potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis, we aimed to identify ROR-alpha target genes in monocytic and endothelial cell lines. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by tiling array (ChIP-on-chip) for ROR-alpha in monocytic cell line THP1 and endothelial cell line HUVEC. Following bioinformatic analysis of the array data, we tested four candidate genes in terms of dependence of their expression level on ligand-mediated ROR-alpha activity, and two of them in terms of promoter occupancy by ROR-alpha. Bioinformatic analyses of ChIP-on-chip data suggested that ROR-alpha binds to genomic regions near the transcription start site (TSS) of more than 3000 genes in THP1 and HUVEC. Potential ROR-alpha target genes in both cell types seem to be involved mainly in membrane receptor activity, signal transduction and ion transport. While SPP1 and IKBKA were shown to be direct target genes of ROR-alpha in THP1 monocytes, inflammation related gene HMOX1 and heat shock protein gene HSPA8 were shown to be potential target genes of ROR-alpha. Our results suggest that ROR-alpha may regulate signaling receptor activity, and transmembrane transport activity through its potential target genes. ROR-alpha seems also to play role in cellular sensitivity to environmental substances like arsenite and chloroprene. Although, the expression analyses have shown that synthetic ROR-alpha ligands can modulate some of potential ROR-alpha target genes, functional significance of ligand-dependent modulation of gene expression needs to be confirmed with further analyses.

Abstract: The redox adaptation mechanisms in cancer cells are very complex and remain largely unclear. Our previous studies have confirmed that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is abundantly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and confers apoptosis resistance on NSCLC cells. However, the comprehensive mechanisms for NOX4-mediated oxidative resistance of cancer cells remain still undentified. The present study found that NOX4-derived H2O2 enhanced the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) stability via disruption of redox-dependent proteasomal degradation and stimulated its activity through activation of PI3K signaling. Specifically, the results showed that ectopic NOX4 expression did not induce apoptosis of A549 cells; however, inhibition of Nrf2 resulted in obvious apoptotic death of NOX4-overexpressed A549 cells, accompanied by a significant increase in H2O2 level and decrease in GSH content. Besides, inhibition of Nrf2 could suppress cell growth and efficiently reverse the enhancement effect of NOX4 on cell growth. The in vivo data confirmed that inhibition of Nrf2 could interfere apoptosis resistance in NOX4-overexpressed A549 tumors and led to cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, these results reveal that Nrf2 is critically involved in redox adaptation regulation in NOX4-overexpressed NSCLC cells. Therefore, NOX4 and Nrf2 may be promising combination targets against malignant progression of NSCLC.

Abstract: Background
Apoptosis plays a fundamental role in appropriate tissue development and function. Although expression of Bcl-2 has been reported during tooth and submandibular gland (SMG) development, the physiological role Bcl-2 plays during these processes has not been addressed. This study was performed to evaluate the impact of Bcl-2 expression on the formation and properties of tooth hard tissue, and saliva production.
Methods
Twenty-four mice (12 males and 12 females) were divided into three groups of eight (n=8): group A (Bcl-2 +/+), group B (Bcl-2 +/-), and group C (Bcl-2 -/-) and subjected to micro-CT analyses. The mineral content of first molars was analyzed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) color dot map. The surface microhardness was determined by Vickers test on labial surfaces of incisors. Saliva was collected from different groups of mice after subcutaneous injection of pilocarpine.
Results
Samples from Bcl-2 -/- mice showed significantly smaller micro-CT values, lower and poor crystallinity of hydroxyapatite (HA), and lowest surface micro hardness. SMG from Bcl-2 -/- mice showed remarkable reduction in size, consistent with reduced saliva accumulation.
Conclusions
The absence of Bcl-2 expression in SMG did not affect the expression of other Bcl-2 family members. Thus, Bcl-2 expression influence on the formation and properties of tooth hard tissue, and saliva accumulation.
Significance
Bcl-2 expression has a significant impact on the mineralogical content of enamel crystals of tooth structure. Lack of Bcl-2 expression led to impaired production of enamel ACP crystals.

Abstract: Summary
Scaffold proteins are ubiquitous chaperones that bind proteins and facilitate physical interaction of multi-enzyme complexes. Here we used a biochemical approach to dissect the scaffold activity of the flotillin-homolog protein FloA of the multi-drug-resistant human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. We show that FloA promotes oligomerization of membrane protein complexes, such as the membrane-associated RNase Rny, which forms part of the RNA-degradation machinery called the degradosome. Cells lacking FloA had reduced Rny function and a consequent increase in the targeted sRNA transcripts that negatively regulate S. aureus toxin expression. Small molecules that altered FloA oligomerization also reduced Rny function and decreased the virulence potential of S. aureus in vitro, as well as in vivo, using invertebrate and murine infection models. Our results suggest that flotillin assists in the assembly of protein complexes involved in S. aureus virulence, and could thus be an attractive target for the development of new antimicrobial therapies.

Abstract: The Hsp70/Hsp90 organising protein (HOP) is a co-chaperone essential for client protein transfer from Hsp70 to Hsp90 within the Hsp90 chaperone machine. Although HOP is upregulated in various cancers, there is limited information from in vitro studies on how HOP expression is regulated in cancer. The main objective of this study was to identify the HOP promoter and investigate its activity in cancerous cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the −2500 to +16 bp region of the HOP gene identified a large CpG island and a range of putative cis-elements. Many of the cis-elements were potentially bound by transcription factors which are activated by oncogenic pathways. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the upstream region of the HOP gene contains an active promoter in vitro. Truncation of this region suggested that the core HOP promoter region was −855 to +16 bp. HOP promoter activity was highest in Hs578T, HEK293T and SV40- transformed MEF1 cell lines which expressed mutant or inactive p53. In a mutant p53 background, expression of wild-type p53 led to a reduction in promoter activity, while inhibition of wild-type p53 in HeLa cells increased HOP promoter activity. Additionally, in Hs578T and HEK293T cell lines containing inactive p53, expression of HRAS increased HOP promoter activity. However, HRAS activation of the HOP promoter was inhibited by p53 overexpression. These findings suggest for the first time that HOP expression in cancer may be regulated by both RAS activation and p53 inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that HOP may be part of the cancer gene signature induced by a combination of mutant p53 and mutated RAS that is associated with cellular transformation.

Abstract: Cross-talk between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is essential for HSCs regulation and leukemogenesis. Studying bone marrow of myelodysplasia patients, a pre-leukemic condition, we found mRNA overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in CD34+ HSCs and semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in BMSCs. To better understand the role of VEGFA and SEMA3A in leukemogenesis, we recruited 30 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 29 acute myeloid leukemia (6 secondary to MDS) patients and 12 controls. We found higher VEGFA expression in de novo AML patients (without prior MDS) group (p=0.0073) and higher SEMA3A expression in all BMSCs patient's samples compared to control group. We then overexpressed VEGFA in an acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG1 cells, and in normal CD34+ cells. This overexpression increased KG1 (p=0.045) and CD34+ cell (p=0.042) viability and KG1 (p=0.042) and CD34+ cell (p=0.047) proliferation. Moreover, KG1 and CD34+ cells overexpressing VEGFA also had increased proliferation when co-cultured with human marrow stromal HS5 cells (p=0.045 and p=0.02, respectively). However, co-culture of these transformed cells with HS5 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 (p=0.004) and CD34+ (p=0.009) proliferation. Co-culture of KG1 transformed cells with HS27 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 proliferation as well (p=0.01). To investigate whether the dominant SEMA3A effect over VEGFA could be due to competition for neuropilin1 receptor (NRP1), we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-NRP1 antibody of cell extracts of co-cultured KG1 and HS5 cells, induced or not by VEGFA and SEMA3A recombinant proteins. Results showed a preferential association of NRP1 with SEMA3A, suggesting that SEMA3A can partially reverse the effects caused by the VEGFA preventing its binding with the NRP1 receptor. Since both hematopoietic cells, leukemic and normal, showed similar behavior, we suppose that the attempt to reversion of VEGF effects by SEMA3A is a homeostatic phenomenon in the hematopoietic niche. Finally, we conclude that VEGFA overexpression confers AML cell advantages and SEMA3A may partially reverse this effect; thus, SEMA3A protein combined with VEGFA inhibitors could be beneficial for AML treatment.

Abstract: In this study, we attempted to explore the function of three uncharacterized mammalian homologs of yeast Yip domain family proteins—YIPF6, a homolog of Yip1p, and YIPF1 and YIPF2, which are homologs of Yif1p. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that YIPF1, YIPF2, and YIPF6 mainly localize in the medial-/trans-Golgi and also partially in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). On treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), the homologs co-migrated partly with medial-/trans-Golgi markers and also with a TGN marker in earlier time point, but finally redistributed within cytoplasmic punctate structures that were distinct from medial-/trans-Golgi and the TGN markers. YIPF6 formed a stable complex separately with YIPF1 and YIPF2, and knockdown of YIPF6 reduced YIPF1 and YIPF2 levels. These results suggest that YIPF6 forms complexes with YIPF1 and YIPF2 for their stable expression and localization within the Golgi apparatus. Knockdown experiments showed that YIPF1 and YIPF2, by contrast, are not necessary for the expression and localization of YIPF6. The structure of the Golgi apparatus and its disassembly after BFA treatment were not significantly affected by the knockdown of YIPF1, YIPF2, or YIPF6. However, reassembly of the Golgi apparatus after the removal of BFA was markedly delayed by the knockdown of YIPF1 and YIPF2, but not by that of YIPF6. These results strongly suggest that free YIPF6 after disassociating with YIPF1 and YIPF2 interferes with the reassembly of the Golgi apparatus. Knockdown of YIPF1 and YIPF2, but not that of YIPF6, also reduced intracellular glycans in HT-29 cells. Thus, we confirmed that YIPF1, YIPF2, and YIPF6 play a significant role in supporting normal glycan synthesis.

Abstract: We previously reported that excess retinoic acid (RA) resulted in hypoplastic and derangement of myofilaments in embryonic tongue by inhibiting myogenic proliferation and differentiation through CamKIID pathway. Our further studies revealed that the expression of a series of miRNAs was altered by RA administration in embryonic tongue as well as in C2C12 cells. Thus, if excess RA impairs myogenic proliferation and differentiation through miRNAs is taken into account. In present study, miR-27b-3p was found up-regulated in RA-treated C2C12 cells as in embryonic tongue, and predicted to target the 3′UTR of α-dystrobrevin (DTNA). Luciferase reporter assays confirmed the direct interaction between miR-27b-3p and the 3′UTR of DTNA. MiR-27b-3p mimics recapitulated the RA repression on DTNA expression, C2C12 proliferation and differentiation, while the miR-27b-3p inhibitor circumvented these defects resulting from excess RA. As expected, the effects of siDTNA on C2C12 were coincided with those by RA treatment or miR-27b-3p mimics. Therefore, these findings indicated that excess RA inhibited the myoblast proliferation and differentiation by up-regulating miR-27b-3p to target DTNA, which implied a new mechanism in myogenic hypoplasia.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is the founding member of a family of transcription factors that function as master regulators of oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 is composed of an O2-regulated HIF-1α subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit. This review provides a compendium of proteins that interact with the HIF-1α subunit, many of which regulate HIF-1 activity in either an O2-dependent or O2-independent manner.

Abstract: Background
Capsular contracture is an incurable complication after silicone-based implant surgery. Myofibroblast is the predominant cell in the contracted capsule. We hypothesized that human adipose derive stromal cells (hASCs) together with fibroblast may show a similar phenotypic characteristics of myofibroblast after the treatment of inflammatory cytokines in vitro.
Materials and methods
Interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were treated in the culture of hASCs and HDFs. Lyn peptide inhibitor was applied as an inhibitor. The changes of cell surface markers (CD105, CD73, CD34, CD45, CD31, CD325 and CD146) were assessed. The expression of various cytokines related to wound contraction were tested such as TGF-β, α-SMA, HGF, FGF, ENT-1, and TSP-1. Myo-D, α-SMA, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were evaluated by blotting and immunocytochemical staining. The collagen-gel contraction assay was performed for the functional contraction of myofibroblastic phenotype.
Results
The expression of α-SMA, Myo-D and GFAP after the treatment of IL-3/GM-CSF showed similar results in hASCs and HDFs. Enhanced expression of TGF- β was observed in HDFs and the increase of ENT-1 and TSP-1 was significant in hASCs. Collagen-gel with HDFs contracted significantly within 24h after the treatment of IL-3/GM-CSF, and the contraction was inhibited by Lyn peptide inhibitor. But in hASCs, the gel-contraction was not significant.
Conclusion
IL-3/ GM-CSF effected on the myofibroblastic differentiation of hASCs as well as it did on HDFs. But hASCs did not show the phenotypic gel-contraction within 24h.

Abstract: Signal-induced proliferation-associated protein 1 (SIPA1) is known to be a GTPase activating protein. Overexpressed SIPA1 is related to metastatic progression in breast and prostate cancers; however, the relevance of SIPA1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine SIPA1 expression and its functional mechanisms in OSCC. SIPA1 mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The expressions of SIPA1 were up-regulated significantly in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SIPA1 expression was correlated with regional lymph node metastasis. We next assessed the cellular functions associated with tumoral metastasis using SIPA1 knockdown (shSIPA1) cells and analyzed the downstream molecules of SIPA1, i.e., bromodomain containing protein 4(BRD4), integrin beta1 (ITGB1), and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). The shSIPA1 cells showed decreased invasiveness and migratory activities, however cellular adhesion ability was maintained at a high level. In addition, ITGB1 expression was greater in shSIPA1 cells, whereas MMP7 expression was lower than in control cells. This research is the first to establish that SIPA1 promotes cancer metastasis by regulating the ITGB1 and MMP7. Therefore, SIPA1 might be a novel therapeutic target for patients with lymph node metastasis of OSCC.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling via G protein-coupled LPA receptors exhibits a variety of biological effects, such as cell proliferation, motility and differentiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of LPA1 and LPA3 in cellular functions during tumor progression in pancreatic cancer cells. LPA1 and LPA3 knockdown cells were generated from PANC-1 cells. The cell motile and invasive activities of PANC-1 cells were inhibited by LPA1 and LPA3 knockdown. In gelatin zymography, LPA1 and LPA3 knockdown cells indicated the low activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the presence of LPA. Next, to assess whether LPA1 and LPA3 regulate cellular functions induced by anticancer drug, PANC-1 cells were treated with cisplatin (CDDP) for approximately 6 months. The cell motile and invasive activities of long-term CDDP treated cells were markedly higher than those of PANC-1 cells, correlating with the expression levels of LPAR1 and LPAR3 genes. In soft agar assay, the long-term CDDP treated cells formed markedly large sized colonies. In addition, the cell motile and invasive activities enhanced by CDDP were significantly suppressed by LPA1 and LPA3 knockdown as well as colony formation.

Abstract: In a previous transcriptomic analysis of 63 ocular melanomas of the uvea, we found that expression of the PRL-3/PTP4A3 gene, encoding a phosphatase that is anchored to the plasma membrane, was associated with the risk of metastasis, and a poor prognosis. We also showed that PRL-3 overexpression in OCM-1 ocular melanoma cells significantly increased cell migration in vitro and invasiveness in vivo, suggesting a direct role for PRL-3 in the metastatic spreading of uveal melanoma. Here, we aimed to identify PRL-3 substrates at the plasma membrane involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We focused on integrin β1, which is the most highly expressed integrin in our cohort of uveal melanomas. We show that preventing PRL-3 anchorage to the plasma membrane i) abolishes PRL-3-induced migration in OCM-1 cells, ii) specifically enhances the spreading of OCM-1 cells overexpressing PRL-3, and iii) favors the maturation of large focal adhesions (FAs) containing integrin β1 on collagen I. Knockdown experiments confirmed integrin β1 involvement in PRL3-induced migration. We identified interactions between PRL-3 and integrin β1, as well as with FAK P-Y397, an auto-activated form of Focal Adhesion Kinase found in FAs. We also show that integrin β1 may be dephosphorylated by PRL-3 in its intracytoplasmic S/T region, an important motif for integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Finally, we observed that PRL-3 regulated the clustering of integrin β1 in FAs on collagen I but not on fibronectin. This work identifies PRL-3 as a new regulator of cell adhesion structures to the extracellular matrix, and further supports PRL-3 as a key actor of metastasis in uveal melanoma, of which molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood.

Abstract: Regenerative repair of the vascular system is challenging from the perspectives of translational medicine and tissue engineering. There are fundamental hurdles in front of creating bioartificial arteries, which involve recaputilation of the three-layered structure under laboratory settings. Obtaining and maintaining smooth muscle characteristics is an important limitation, as the transdifferentiated cells fail to display mature phenotype. This study aims to shed light on the smooth muscle differentiation of human adipose stem cells (hASCs). To this end, we first acquired hASCs from lipoaspirate samples. Upon characterization, the cells were induced to differentiate into smooth muscle (SM)-like cells using a variety of inducer combinations. Among all, TGFβ1/BMP4 combination had the highest differentiation efficiency, based on immunohistochemical analyses. hSM-like cell samples were compared to hASCs and to the positive control, human coronary artery-smooth muscle cells (hCA-SMCs) through gene transcription profiling. Microarray findings revealed the activation of gene groups that function in smooth muscle differentiation, signaling pathways, extracellular modeling and cell proliferation. Our results underline the effectiveness of the growth factors and suggest some potential variables for detecting the SM-like cell characteristics. Evidence in transcriptome level was used to evaluate the TGFβ1/BMP4 combination as a previously unexplored effector for the smooth muscle differentiation of adipose stem cells.

Abstract: In the field of hematopoietic regeneration, deriving hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells with engraftment potential is the central mission. Unstable hematopoietic differentiation protocol due to variation factors such as serums and feeder cells, remains a major technical issue impeding the screening of key factors for the derivation of HSCs. In combination with hematopoietic cytokines, UM171 has the capacity to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of human primary HSCs in vitro. Here, using a serum-free, feeder-free, and chemically defined induction protocol, we observed that UM171 enhanced hematopoietic derivation through the entire process of hematopoietic induction in vitro. UM171 facilitated generation of robust CD34+CD45+ derivatives that formed more and larger sized CFU-GM as well as larger sized CFU-Mix. In our protocol, the derived hematopoietic progenitors failed to engraft in NOG mice, indicating the absence of long-term HSC from these progenitors. In combination with other factors and protocols, UM171 might be broadly used for hematopoietic derivation from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro.

Abstract: Convulxin (CVX), a C-type lectin-like protein (CLPs), is a potent platelet aggregation inducer. To evaluate its potential applications in angiogenic diseases, the multimeric CVX were further explored on its mode of actions toward human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs). The N-terminus of β-chain of CVX (CVX-β) contains a putative disintegrin-like domain with a conserved motif upon the sequence comparison with other CLPs. Importantly, native CVX had no cytotoxic activity as examined by electrophoretic pattern. A Trp-Ala–Asp (WAD)-containing octapeptide, MTWADAEK, was thereafter synthesized and analyzed in functional assays. In the case of specific integrin antagonists as positive controls, the anti-angiogenic effects of CVX on HCASMCs were investigated by series of functional analyses. CVX showed to exhibit multiple inhibitory activities toward HCASMCs proliferation, adhesion and invasion with a dose- and integrin αvβ3-dependent fashion. However, the WAD-octapeptide exerting a minor potency could also work as an active peptidomimetic. In addition, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated both the intact CVX and synthetic peptide can specifically interact with integrin-αv on HCASMCs and CVX was shown to have a down-regulatory effect on the gene expression of CXC-chemokines, such as growth-related oncogene and interleukin-8. According to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 translocation assay and Western blotting analysis, the NF-κB activation was not involved in the signaling events of CVX-induced gene expression. In conclusion, CVX may act as a disintegrin-like protein via the interactions of WAD-motif in CVX-β with integrin-αv on HCASMCs and it also is a gene suppressor with the ability to diminish the expression of two CXC-chemokines in a NF-κB-independent manner. Indeed, more extensive investigations are needed and might create a new avenue for the development of a novel angiostatic agent.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related skeletal degeneration in patients with osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and occurs concomitant with an increase in bone marrow adipocytes. Using microarray expression profiling with high temporal resolution, we identified gene regulatory events in early stages of osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Data analysis revealed three distinct phases when cells adopt a committed expression phenotype: initiation of differentiation (0–3 hr, phase I), lineage acquisition (6–24 hr, phase II), and early lineage progression (48–96 hr, phase III). Upstream regulator analysis identified 34 transcription factors (TFs) in phase I with a role in hMSC differentiation. Interestingly, expression levels of identified TFs did not always change and indicate additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Functional analysis revealed that forced expression of IRF2 enhances osteogenic differentiation. Thus, IRF2 and other early-responder TFs may control osteogenic cell fate of MSCs and should be considered in mechanistic models that clarify bone-anabolic changes during clinical progression of osteoporosis.

Abstract: Constitutively expressed small heat shock protein HspB1 regulates many fundamental cellular processes and plays major roles in many human pathological diseases. In that regard, this chaperone has a huge number of apparently unrelated functions that appear linked to its ability to recognize many client polypeptides that are subsequently modified in their activity and/or half-life. A major parameter to understand how HspB1 is dedicated to interact with particular clients in defined cellular conditions relates to its complex oligomerization and phosphorylation properties. Indeed, HspB1 structural organization displays dynamic and complex rearrangements in response to changes in the cellular environment or when the cell physiology is modified. These structural modifications probably reflect the formation of structural platforms aimed at recognizing specific client polypeptides. Here, I have reviewed data from the literature and re-analyzed my own studies to describe and discuss these fascinating changes in HspB1 structural organization.

Abstract: The poor self-repair capacity of cartilage tissue in degenerative conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA), has prompted the development of a variety of therapeutic approaches, such as cellular therapies and tissue engineering based on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The aim of this study is to demonstrate, for the first time, that the chondrocytes differentiated from rat adipose tissue derived-MSCs (AMSCs), are able to constitute a morphologically and biochemically healthy hyaline cartilage after 6 weeks of culture on a Collagen Cell Carrier (CCC) scaffold. In this study we evaluated the expression of some osteoblasts (Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osteocalcin), chondrocytes (collagen I, II and lubricin) and apoptosis (caspase-3) biomarkers in undifferentiated AMSCs, differentiated AMSCs in chondrocytes cultured in monolayer and AMSCs-derived chondrocytes seeded on CCC scaffolds, by different techniques such as immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blot and gene expression analyses. Our results showed the increased expression of collagen II and lubricin in AMSCs-derived chondrocytes cultured on CCC scaffolds, whereas the expression of collagen I, RUNX2, osteocalcin and caspase-3 resulted decreased, when compared to the controls. In conclusion, this innovative basic study could be a possible key for future therapeutic strategies for articular cartilage restoration through the use of CCC scaffolds, to reduce the morbidity from acute cartilage injuries and degenerative joint diseases.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is marked by imbalanced metabolism of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the nucleus pulposus (NP) of intervertebral discs. This study aimed to determine whether sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a member of the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylases, protects the NP from ECM degradation in IDD. Our study showed that expression of SIRT6 markedly decreased during IDD progression. Overexpression of wild-type SIRT6, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, prevented IL-1β-induced NP ECM degradation. SIRT6 depletion by RNA interference in NP cells caused ECM degradation. Moreover, SIRT6 physically interacted with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) catalytic subunit p65, transcriptional activity of which was significantly suppressed by SIRT6 overexpression. These results suggest that SIRT6 prevented NP ECM degradation in vitro via inhibiting NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity and that this effect depended on its deacetylase activity.

Abstract: Eva-1 homolog A (EVA1A) is a novel lysosome and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein involved in autophagy and apoptosis. In this study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus 5-EVA1A vector (Ad5-EVA1A) to overexpress EVA1A in glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines and evaluated its anti-tumor activities in vitro and in vivo. We found that overexpression of EVA1A in three GBM cell lines (U251, U87 and SHG44) resulted in a suppression of tumor cell growth via activation of autophagy and induction of cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. EVA1A-mediated autophagy was associated with inactivation of the mTOR/RPS6KB1 signaling pathway. Furthermore in vivo, overexpression of EVA1A successfully inhibited tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice. Our data suggest that EVA1A-induced autophagy and apoptosis play a role in suppressing the development of GBM and their up-regulation may be an effective method for treating this form of cancer.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells from human bone marrow (hBM-MSC) are widely utilized for clinical applications involving bone healing. In this context, their use has been often optimized in association to variously designed titanium substrates, being this material of great use in orthopaedic implants. According to recent findings, the ability of hBM-MSC to differentiate towards a specific lineage is not only driven by biochemical signals, but physical stimuli, such as rigidity or roughness of the substrate, can also support a commitment towards osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the presence of features with defined dimensional scales, in particular nanometer-size, also proved to elicit specific biological effects. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of a nano-patterned titanium surface in sustaining hBM-MSC adhesion, growth and differentiation by means of a panel of biophysical tools: morphometry, electrophysiology, intracellular calcium measurements and immunocytochemistry. The results substantiate the idea that this micro-textured titanium dioxide is a good surface for growth and differentiation of hBM-MSC and it exhibits a stimulating action mainly in the initial period of differentiation. Moreover, the basal concentration of free cytosolic Calcium [Ca2+]i is confirmed to be a good hallmark of the hBM-MSC maturation stage. The study could provide relevant hints to help improving the biocompatibility and osteointegration potential of clinical titanium implants.

Abstract: DnaK, a major Hsp70 molecular chaperones in Escherichia coli, is a widely used model for studying Hsp70s. We recently solved a crystal structure of DnaK in complex with ATP and showed that DnaK was packed as a dimer in the crystal structure. Our previous biochemical studies supported the formation of a specific DnaK dimer as observed in the crystal structure in solution in the presence of ATP and suggested an important role of this dimer in efficient interaction with Hsp40 co-chaperones. In this study, we dissected the biochemical properties of this DnaK dimer. To restrict DnaK in this dimer form, we mutated two residues on the dimer interface to cysteine, A303C, and H541C. Upon oxidation, this DnaK-A303C-H541C protein formed a specific dimer linked by disulfide bonds formed between A303C and H541C only in the presence of ATP, consistent with the crystal structure. Intriguingly, this disulfide-bond-linked dimer of DnaK-A303C-H541C has reduced ATPase activity and decreased affinity for peptide substrate. More interestingly, unlike wild-type DnaK, the peptide substrate-binding kinetics of this dimer is drastically accelerated even in the absence of ATP, suggesting this dimer is restricted in an ATP-bound conformation regardless of nucleotide bound, which was further supported by our analysis using tryptophan fluorescence and ATP-induced peptide release. Thus, formation of the dimer restricted DnaK in an ATP-bound state and blocked the progression through the chaperone cycle. Productive progression through the chaperone cycle requires the dissociation of this transient dimer. Surprisingly, a significantly compromised interaction with Hsp40 co-chaperone was observed for this disulfide-bond-linked dimer. Thus, dissociation of this DnaK dimer is equally crucial for efficient Hsp40 interaction. An initial interaction between Hsp70 and Hsp40 requires the formation of DnaK dimer; but a stable Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction may follow the dissociation of the dimer.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) although being potent in repairing injured or ischemic tissues, their success regarding tissue-regenerative approaches are hindered by the paucity in their viability. The elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in damaged sites provoke the pernicious effects of donor MSC survival. In the present study, the effect of delta-opioid receptor (DOR) activation on human umbilical cord-blood borne fibroblasts (hUCB-BFs) survival under oxidative stress (H2O2) was evaluated. Oxidative stress which is known to trigger pathological conditions of the unfolded protein response (UPR) leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Upon its activation by D-Alanine 2, Leucine 5 Enkephaline (DADLE, selective DOR agonist) in hUCB-BFs under oxidative stress, a significant down regulation (~2 folds) of key UPR genes was observed as determined by qPCR, Thioflavin-T protein aggregation assay and western blot analysis. Concomitantly, the oxidative stress-mediated cell-death was ameliorated and the viable-cells' percentage was enhanced following DOR activation. The intracellular ROS production upon H2O2 treatment as determined by CM-H2DCFDA staining was repressed, the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 was upregulated along with a significant suppression in the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad upon DOR activation. Upon subsequent treatment with naltrindole, the effects of DADLE-induced cytoprotection were reverted significantly. These results propound the role of DADLE-mediated DOR-activation on improvement of the viability, which might succour successful hUCB-BFs transplants and greatly absolve the inefficacy of tissue-specific engineered transplants.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling is critically involved in neural development, but the downstream effectors remain incompletely understood. In this study, we cultured neurospheres from Nestin-Cre-mediated conditional Rbp-j knockout (Rbp-j cKO) and control embryos and compared their miRNA expression profiles using microarray. Among differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-342-5p showed upregulated expression as Notch signaling was genetically or pharmaceutically interrupted. Consistently, the promoter of the miR-342-5p host gene, the Ena-vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein-like (Evl), was negatively regulated by Notch signaling, probably through HES5. Transfection of miR-342-5p promoted the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) in vitro and reduced the stemness of NSCs in vivo. Furthermore, miR-342-5p inhibited the differentiation of neural stem/intermediate progenitor cells into astrocytes, likely mediated by targeting GFAP directly. Our results indicated that miR-342-5p could function as a downstream effector of Notch signaling to regulate the differentiation of NSCs into INPs and astrocytes commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Human stem cell models have the potential to provide platforms for phenotypic screens to identify candidate treatments and cellular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and the accumulation of APP-derived amyloid β (Aβ) peptides are key processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We designed a phenotypic small-molecule screen to identify modulators of APP processing in trisomy 21/Down syndrome neurons, a complex genetic model of AD. We identified the avermectins, commonly used as anthelmintics, as compounds that increase the relative production of short Aβ peptides at the expense of longer, potentially more toxic peptides. Further studies demonstrated that this effect is not due to an interaction with the core γ-secretase responsible for Aβ production. This study demonstrates the feasibility of phenotypic drug screening in human stem cell models of Alzheimer-type dementia, and points to possibilities for indirectly modulating APP processing, independently of γ-secretase modulation.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are proposed as the cells of origin of several subtypes of osteosarcoma (OS). However, signals that direct BMSCs to form different subtypes of OS are unclear. Here we show that the default tumor type from spontaneously transformed p53 knockout (p53_KO) BMSCs is osteoblastic OS. The development of this default tumor type caused by p53 loss can be overridden by various oncogenic signals: RAS reprograms p53_KO BMSCs into undifferentiated sarcoma, AKT enhances osteoblastic OS, while cFOS promotes chondroblastic OS formation. We focus on studying the mechanism of cFOS-induced chondroblastic OS formation. Integrated genome-wide studies reveal a regulatory mechanism whereby cFOS binds to the promoter of a key chondroblastic transcription factor, Sox9, and induces its transcription in BMSCs. Importantly, SOX9 mediates cFOS-induced cartilage formation in chondroblastic OS. In summary, oncogenes determine tumor types derived from BMSCs, and the cFOS-SOX9 axis is critical for chondroblastic OS formation.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise for the treatment of many incurable diseases. Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, is abundantly expressed in hESCs and is known to regulate early differentiation and telomere elongation. Here, we show that downregulation of SIRT1 promotes cell death in hESCs, but not in differentiated cells, and the SIRT1-inhibition-mediated cell death is preceded by increased DNA damage. This increased DNA damage is at least partially due to decreased levels of DNA repair enzymes such as MSH2, MSH6, and APEX1. Furthermore, SIRT1 inhibition causes p53 activation, which eventually leads to DNA damage-induced apoptosis of hESCs. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanism of SIRT1-mediated hESC survival and should contribute to the development of safe and effective cell therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are integral components of signal transduction cascades that regulate cell biology through ATP-dependent phosphorylation of the lipid messenger diacylglycerol. Methods for direct evaluation of DGK activity in native biological systems are lacking and needed to study isoform-specific functions of these multidomain lipid kinases. Here, we utilize ATP acyl phosphate activity-based probes and quantitative mass spectrometry to define, for the first time, ATP and small-molecule binding motifs of representative members from all five DGK subtypes. We use chemical proteomics to discover an unusual binding mode for the DGKα inhibitor, ritanserin, including interactions at the atypical C1 domain distinct from the ATP binding region. Unexpectedly, deconstruction of ritanserin yielded a fragment compound that blocks DGKα activity through a conserved binding mode and enhanced selectivity against the kinome. Collectively, our studies illustrate the power of chemical proteomics to profile protein-small molecule interactions of lipid kinases for fragment-based lead discovery.

Abstract: Our previous studies have identified that CD166 works as a cancer stem-like cell (CSC) marker in epithelial cancers with a large repertoire of cellular functions. However, the post-translational regulatory mechanisms underlying CD166 turnover remain elusive. Several independent studies have reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP revealed significant biological effects through ubiquitin proteasome pathway on some kinds of malignant tumors. With analyzing the effects of CHIP expressions on stem-like cell populations, we found that CHIP represses CSC characteristics mainly targeting the CSC related protein CD166 in head and neck cancer (HNC). To investigate the role and relationship between CD166 and CHIP, HNC tissues and cell lines were used in this study. A significant negative correlation was observed between the expression levels of CHIP and CD166 in HNC patient samples. We also found that CHIP directly regulates the stability of CD166 protein through the ubiquitin proteasome system, which was also identified participating in the regulation of CSC behaviors in HNCs. Our findings demonstrate that CHIP-CD166-proteasome axis participates in regulating CSC properties in HNCs, suggesting that the regulation of CD166 by CHIP could provide new options for diagnosing and treating in the patients with HNCs.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a ubiquitous part of the machinery that maintains cellular protein homeostasis by acting as molecular chaperones. sHsps bind to and prevent the aggregation of partially folded substrate proteins in an ATP-independent manner. sHsps are dynamic, forming an ensemble of structures from dimers to large oligomers through concentration-dependent equilibrium dissociation. Based on structural studies and mutagenesis experiments, it is proposed that the dimer is the smallest active chaperone unit, while larger oligomers may act as storage depots for sHsps or play additional roles in chaperone function. The complexity and dynamic nature of their structural organization has made elucidation of their chaperone function challenging. HspB1 and HspB5 are two canonical human sHsps that vary in sequence and are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. In order to determine the role of the dimer in chaperone activity, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was genetically linked as a fusion protein to the N-terminus regions of both HspB1 and HspB5 (also known as Hsp27 and αB-crystallin, respectively) proteins in order to constrain oligomer formation of HspB1 and HspB5, by using GST, since it readily forms a dimeric structure. We monitored the chaperone activity of these fusion proteins, which suggest they primarily form dimers and monomers and function as active molecular chaperones. Furthermore, the two different fusion proteins exhibit different chaperone activity for two model substrate proteins, citrate synthase (CS) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). GST-HspB1 prevents more aggregation of MDH compared to GST-HspB5 and wild type HspB1. However, when CS is the substrate, both GST-HspB1 and GST-HspB5 are equally effective chaperones. Furthermore, wild type proteins do not display equal activity toward the substrates, suggesting that each sHsp exhibits different substrate specificity. Thus, substrate specificity, as described here for full-length GST fusion proteins with MDH and CS, is modulated by both sHsp oligomeric conformation and by variations of sHsp sequences.

Abstract: Summary
We previously showed the efficacy of multiple research cell lines (RCLs) of human CNS neural stem cells (HuCNS-SCs) in mouse and rat models of thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), supporting a thoracic SCI clinical trial. Experts recommend in vivo preclinical testing of the intended clinical cell lot/line (CCL) in models with validity for the planned clinical target. We therefore tested the efficacy of two HuCNS-SC lines in cervical SCI: one RCL, and one CCL intended for use in the Pathway Study of cervical SCI in man. We assessed locomotor recovery and sensory function, as well as engraftment, migration, and fate. No evidence of efficacy of the CCL was observed; some data suggested a negative impact of the CCL on outcomes. These data raise questions about the development and validation of potency/comparability assays for clinical testing of cell products, and lack of US Food and Drug Administration requirements for in vivo testing of intended clinical cell lines.

Abstract: Although SRSF3 (Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3) plays a significant role in various biological processes, many of its functions still remain unclear. More particularly, little is known about SRSF3's involvement in the regulation of miRNA. In this report, we found that invasive and migratory abilities were inhibited in SRSF3-silenced U2OS and HeLa cells. We also found that a knockdown of SRSF3 results in a decreased expression level of REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor). The silencing of REST increased the expression of primary miR-132/212 as well as their mature forms. In particular, miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p possess an identical seed sequences and a common target gene. Overexpression of miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p suppressed the expression of YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) by directly binding to the 3՚UTR of its mRNA. CCND1 (Cyclin D1), which acts downstream of YAP1, was downregulated in both miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p-overexpressed cells, in correlation with diminished YAP1 levels. Taken together, our results reveal that SRSF3 controls the expression of the miR-132/212 cluster through regulating REST expression, and that the REST-elicited alteration of miRNA expression is implicated in enabling the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells.

Abstract: Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is characterized by the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and inflammatory lesions. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effect of atractylenolide I (AO-I) on smooth muscle cell inflammation, proliferation and migration induced by oxidized modified low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL). Here, We found that atractylenolide I inhibited Ox-LDL-induced VSMCs proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in VSMCs. The study also identified that AO-I prominently inhibited p38-MAPK and NF-κB activation. More importantly, the specific heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) IX partially abolished the beneficial effects of atractylenolide I on Ox-LDL-induced VSMCs. Furthermore, atractylenolide I blocked the foam cell formation in macrophages induced by Ox-LDL. In summary, inhibitory roles of AO-I in VSMCs proliferation and migration, lipid peroxidation and subsequent inflammatory responses might contribute to the anti-atherosclerotic property of AO-I.

Abstract: In mammals, small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) typically assemble into interconverting, polydisperse oligomers. The dynamic exchange of sHSP oligomers is regulated, at least in part, by molecular interactions between the α-crystallin domain and the C-terminal region (CTR). Here we report solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy investigations of the conformation and dynamics of the disordered and flexible CTR of human HSP27, a systemically expressed sHSP. We observed multiple NMR signals for residues in the vicinity of proline 194, and we determined that, while all observed forms are highly disordered, the extra resonances arise from cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization about the G193-P194 peptide bond. The cis-P194 state is populated to near 15% at physiological temperatures, and, although both cis- and trans-P194 forms of the CTR are flexible and dynamic, both states show a residual but differing tendency to adopt β-strand conformations. In NMR spectra of an isolated CTR peptide, we observed similar evidence for isomerization involving proline 182, found within the IPI/V motif. Collectively, these data indicate a potential role for cis-trans proline isomerization in regulating the oligomerization of sHSPs.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulating autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Neurons are insensitive to current approaches based on mTOR inhibition for activating autophagy, and instead may rely on the Parkinson's disease-associated proteins PINK1 and PARKIN to activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in response to mitochondrial damage. We developed a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to, PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes. These data suggest that stress-dependent pharmacological reactivation of autophagy could prevent the loss of vulnerable neurons to slow neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial aromatic polyketides are a group of natural products synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) that show diverse structures and biological activities. They are structurally subclassified into linear, angular, and discoid aromatic polyketides, the formation of which is commonly determined by the shaping and folding of the poly-β-keto intermediates under the concerted actions of the minimal PKSs, cyclases and ketoreductases. Murayaquinone, found in several streptomycetes, possesses an unusual tricyclic angular aromatic polyketide core containing a 9,10-phenanthraquinone. In this study, genes essential for murayaquinone biosynthesis were identified, and a linear anthraoxirene intermediate was discovered. A unique biosynthetic model for the angular aromatic polyketide formation was discovered and confirmed through in vivo and in vitro studies. Three oxidoreductases, MrqO3, MrqO6, and MrqO7, were identified to catalyze the conversion of the linear aromatic polyketide intermediate into the final angularly arranged framework, which exemplifies a novel strategy for the biosynthesis of angular aromatic polyketides.

Abstract: Recent clinical and experimental evidences strongly acclaim Yes-associated protein (Yap), a key oncogenic driver in liver carcinogenesis, as a therapeutic target. Of the known multiple schemes to inhibit Yap activity, activation of Mammalian Sterile 20-like Kinase 1 (Mst1), an upstream regulator of Yap, appears to be a promising one. In this study, we hypothesize that morin, a bioflavonoid, mediates its anti-cancer effect through the activation of Mst1/hippo signaling in liver cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, both full length Mst1 (F-Mst1) and kinase active N-terminal Mst1 (N-Mst1)-overexpressed HepG2 cells were used. Exposure of F-Mst1 overexpressed HepG2 cells to morin activated Mst1 by caspase-3 cleavage and thereby inhibited Yap nuclear translocation and fostered apoptosis. Morin suppressed NF-κB p65 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling through Mst1 activation via cleavage and phosphorylation, leading to cell death. Annexin-V/PI staining further confirmed the induction of apoptosis in morin treated F-Mst1 overexpressed cells. The present study shows that morin targets cell survival molecules such as NF-κB p65 and β-catenin through activation of hippo signaling. Therefore, morin could be considered as a potential anti-cancer agent against liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Current efforts to repair damaged or diseased mammalian retinas are inefficient and largely incapable of fully restoring vision. Conversely, the zebrafish retina is capable of spontaneous regeneration upon damage using Müller glia (MG)-derived progenitors. Understanding how zebrafish MG initiate regeneration may help develop new treatments that prompt mammalian retinas to regenerate. We show that inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling facilitates initiation of MG proliferation. GABA levels decrease following damage, and MG are positioned to detect decreased ambient levels and undergo dedifferentiation. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that GABAA receptor inhibition stimulates regeneration in undamaged retinas while activation inhibits regeneration in damaged retinas.

Abstract: The lack of homing ability possibly reduces the healing potential of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Therefore, transforming native CD44 on MSCs into a hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand (HCELL) that possesses potent E-selectin affinity might enhance the homing and regenerative abilities of MSCs. Through fucosyltransferase VI (FTVI) transfection, MSCs were fucosylated on N-glycans of CD44 to become HCELL positive, thus interacting with E-selectin on injured endothelial cells. HCELL expression facilitated MSC homing in kidneys within 24h after injury and reduced lung stasis. An in vitro adhesion assay revealed that transfection enhanced the association between MSCs and hypoxic endothelial cells. In mice treated with HCELL-positive MSCs, the injured kidneys exhibited clusters of homing MSCs, whereas MSCs were rarely observed in mouse kidneys treated with HCELL-negative MSCs. Most MSCs were initially localized at the renal capsule, and some MSCs later migrated inward between tubules. Most homing MSCs were in close contact with inflammatory cells without tubular transdifferentiation. Furthermore, HCELL-positive MSCs substantially alleviated renal injury, partly by enhancing the polarization of infiltrating macrophages. In conclusion, engineering the glycan of CD44 on MSCs through FTVI transfection might enhance renotropism and the regenerating ability of MSCs in ischemic kidney injury.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons communicate by regulated secretion of chemical signals from synaptic vesicles (SVs) and dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Here, we investigated the maturation of these two secretory pathways in micro-networks of human iPSC-derived neurons. These micro-networks abundantly expressed endogenous SV and DCV markers, including neuropeptides. DCV transport was microtubule dependent, preferentially anterograde in axons, and 2-fold faster in axons than in dendrites. SV and DCV secretion were strictly Ca2+ and SNARE dependent. DCV secretion capacity matured until day in vitro (DIV) 36, with intense stimulation releasing 6% of the total DCV pool, and then plateaued. This efficiency is comparable with mature mouse neurons. In contrast, SV secretion capacity continued to increase until DIV50, with substantial further increase in secretion efficiency and decrease in silent synapses. These data show that the two secretory pathways can be studied in human neurons and that they mature differentially, with DCV secretion reaching maximum efficiency when that of SVs is still low.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Previous studies have reported that the oxidored-nitro domain containing protein 1 (NOR1) is a novel tumor suppressor in several tumors. Recent evidence suggests that NOR1 is strongly expressed in HCC cells. However, its role and mechanism in HCC are unclear. In the current study, Western blot and qPCR detected strong NOR1 mRNA and protein expression in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. After transfection with NOR1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-myc-his-NOR1, the proliferation and migration of HepG2 and Hep3B cells were analyzed in vitro. HepG2 or Hep3B cells overexpressing NOR1 showed an increased proliferation and migration, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of NOR1 showed the opposite effect. Furthermore, NOR1 activated the Notch signaling pathway, indicated by increased levels of Notch1, NICD, Hes1, and Hey1 in protein. Importantly, the Notch inhibitor DAPT downregulated Notch activation and further enhanced siNOR1-induced reduction of cell proliferation and migration in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, whereas DAPT reversed the effect of NOR1 overexpression on cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, these results indicate that NOR1 may be involved in the progression of HCC and thus may be a potential target for the treatment of liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The transmembrane protein, STRA6, functions as a vitamin A transporter and a cytokine receptor when activated by vitamin A-bound serum retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). STRA6 activation transduces a JAK2-STAT3 signaling cascade and promotes tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model of colon cancer. We show here that RBP4 and STRA6 expression is associated with poor oncologic prognosis. Downregulating STRA6 or RBP4 in colon cancer cells decreased the fraction of cancer stem cells and their sphere and tumor initiation frequency. Furthermore, we show that high-fat diet (HFD) increases LGR5 expression and promotes tumor growth in a xenograft model independent of obesity. HFD increased STRA6 levels, and downregulation of STRA6 delays and impairs tumor initiation, tumor growth, and expression of stemness markers. Together, these data demonstrate a key role of STRA6 and RBP4 in the maintenance of colon cancer self-renewal and that this pathway is an important link through which consumption of HFD contributes to colon carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are promising in regenerative medicine. However, the risks of teratoma formation and the overgrowth of the transplanted cells continue to be major hurdles that must be overcome. Here, we examined the efficacy of the inducible caspase-9 (iCaspase9) gene as a fail-safe against undesired tumorigenic transformation of iPSC-derived somatic cells. We used a lentiviral vector to transduce iCaspase9 into two iPSC lines and assessed its efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the iCaspase9 system induced apoptosis in approximately 95% of both iPSCs and iPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (iPSC-NS/PCs). To determine in vivo function, we transplanted iPSC-NS/PCs into the injured spinal cord of NOD/SCID mice. All transplanted cells whose mass effect was hindering motor function recovery were ablated upon transduction of iCaspase9. Our results suggest that the iCaspase9 system may serve as an important countermeasure against post-transplantation adverse events in stem cell transplant therapies.

Abstract: Several metabolic enzymes assemble into distinct intracellular structures in prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggesting an important functional role in cell physiology. The CTP-generating enzyme CTP synthase forms long filamentous structures termed cytoophidia in bacteria, yeast, fruit flies and human cells independent of its catalytic activity. However, the amino acid determinants for protein-protein interaction necessary for polymerisation remained unknown. In this study, we systematically analysed the role of the conserved N-terminal of Drosophila CTP synthase in cytoophidium assembly. Our mutational analyses identified three key amino acid residues within this region that play an instructive role in organisation of CTP synthase into a filamentous structure. Co-transfection assays demonstrated formation of heteromeric CTP synthase filaments which is disrupted by protein carrying a mutated N-terminal alanine residue thus revealing a dominant-negative activity. Interestingly, the dominant-negative activity is supressed by the CTP synthase inhibitor DON. Furthermore, we found that the amino acids at the corresponding position in the human protein exhibit similar properties suggesting conservation of their function through evolution. Our data suggest that cytoophidium assembly is a multi-step process involving N-terminal-dependent sequential interactions between correctly folded structural units and provide insights into the assembly of these enigmatic structures.

Abstract: Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is an all-encompassing term for the movement of DNA between diverse organisms. LGT is synonymous with horizontal gene transfer, and the terms are used interchangeably throughout the scientific literature. While LGT has been recognized within the bacteria domain of life for decades, inter-domain LGTs are being increasingly described. LGTs between bacteria and complex multicellular organisms are of interest because they challenge the long-held dogma that such transfers could only occur in closely-related, single-celled organisms. Scientists will continue to challenge our understanding of LGT as we sequence more, diverse organisms, as we sequence more endosymbiont-colonized arthropods, and as we continue to appreciate LGT events, both young and old.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage within the joint, inflammation and pain. The purpose of this study was to develop a primary, serum free cell culture system of human osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes (HOACs) with which to study manifestations of the disease process. Joint tissues were obtained from OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). HOACs isolated from the femoral condyles and tibial plateau of the same side were combined, plated in three-dimensional, alginate beads and cultured for five days in serum, hormone and protein free medium. More living cells were obtained from the femoral condyles than the tibial plateau. The optimal plating density was 2.5 × 106 cells/ml of alginate. The amounts of DNA, RNA, proteoglycans and total collagen were similar in cultures prepared from the sides of least and greatest pathology. More type 1 than type 2 collagen was detected in the medium on days 2 and 5. A greater percentage of type 1 than type 2 collagen was degraded. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta was present in the medium and alginate associated matrix. Although variation in the metabolic profiles between subjects was observed, HOACs from all patients continued to reflect the OA phenotype for five days in culture. This serum free, three-dimensional primary culture system of HOACs provides a platform with which to measure clinically relevant endpoints of OA and screen potential disease modifying OA therapeutics.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are gatekeepers of cellular homeostasis across species, preserving proteome integrity under stressful conditions. Nonetheless, recent evidence suggests that sHSPs are more than molecular chaperones with merely auxiliary role. In contrast, sHSPs have emerged as central lifespan determinants, and their malfunction has been associated with the manifestation of neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer malignancies. In this review, we focus on the role of sHSPs in ageing and age-associated diseases and highlight the most prominent paradigms, where impairment of sHSP function has been implicated in human pathology.

Abstract: Small teleost fish such as zebrafish and medaka are increasingly studied as models for human skeletal diseases. Efficient new genome editing tools combined with advances in the analysis of skeletal phenotypes provide new insights into fundamental processes of skeletal development. The skeleton among vertebrates is a highly conserved organ system, but teleost fish and mammals have evolved unique traits or have lost particular skeletal elements in each lineage. Several unique features of the skeleton relate to the extremely small size of early fish embryos and the small size of adult fish used as models. A detailed analysis of the plethora of interesting skeletal phenotypes in zebrafish and medaka pushes available skeletal imaging techniques to their respective limits and promotes the development of new imaging techniques. Impressive numbers of zebrafish and medaka mutants with interesting skeletal phenotypes have been characterized, complemented by transgenic zebrafish and medaka lines. The advent of efficient genome editing tools, such as TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9, allows to introduce targeted deficiencies in genes of model teleosts to generate skeletal phenotypes that resemble human skeletal diseases. This review will also discuss other attractive aspects of the teleost skeleton. This includes the capacity for lifelong tooth replacement and for the regeneration of dermal skeletal elements, such as scales and fin rays, which further increases the value of zebrafish and medaka models for skeletal research.

Abstract: Understanding the regulatory networks underlying lineage differentiation and fate determination of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) is a prerequisite for their therapeutic use. The goal of the current study was to unravel the novel role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 3 (LRP3) in regulating the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of immortalized hBMSCs. Gene expression profiling revealed significantly higher LRP3 levels in the highly osteogenic hBMSC clone imCL1 than in the less osteogenic clone imCL2, as well as a significant upregulation of LRP3 during the osteogenic induction of the imCL1 clone. Data from functional and gene expression assays demonstrated the role of LRP3 as a molecular switch promoting hBMSC lineage differentiation into osteoblasts and inhibiting differentiation into adipocytes. Interestingly, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling identified miR-4739 as the most under-represented miRNA (−36.11 fold) in imCL1 compared to imCL2. The TargetScan prediction algorithm, combined with functional and biochemical assays, identified LRP3 mRNA as a novel target of miR-4739, with a single potential binding site for miR-4739 located in the LRP3 3′ UTR. Regulation of LRP3 expression by miR-4739 was subsequently confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and luciferase assays. Over-expression of miR-4739 mimicked the effects of LRP3 knockdown on promoting adipogenic and suppressing osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Hence, we report for the first time a novel biological role for the LRP3/hsa-miR-4739 axis in balancing osteogenic and adipocytic differentiation of hBMSCs. Our data support the potential utilization of miRNA-based therapies in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a deadly fungal pathogen whose intracellular lifestyle is important for virulence. Host mechanisms controlling fungal phagocytosis and replication remain obscure. Here, we perform a global phosphoproteomic analysis of the host response to Cryptococcus infection. Our analysis reveals numerous and diverse host proteins that are differentially phosphorylated following fungal ingestion by macrophages, thereby indicating global reprogramming of host kinase signaling. Notably, phagocytosis of the pathogen activates the host autophagy initiation complex (AIC) and the upstream regulatory components LKB1 and AMPKα, which regulate autophagy induction through their kinase activities. Deletion of Prkaa1, the gene encoding AMPKα1, in monocytes results in resistance to fungal colonization of mice. Finally, the recruitment of AIC components to nascent Cryptococcus-containing vacuoles (CnCVs) regulates the intracellular trafficking and replication of the pathogen. These findings demonstrate that host AIC regulatory networks confer susceptibility to infection and establish a proteomic resource for elucidating host mechanisms that regulate fungal intracellular parasitism.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) sense and modulate inflammation and represent potential clinical treatment for immune disorders. However, many details of the bidirectional interaction of MSCs and the innate immune compartment are still unsolved. Here we describe an unconventional but functional interaction between pro-inflammatory classically activated macrophages (M1MΦ) and MSCs, with CD54 playing a central role. CD54 was upregulated and enriched specifically at the contact area between M1MФ and MSCs. Moreover, the specific interaction induced calcium signaling and increased the immunosuppressive capacities of MSCs dependent on CD54 mediation. Our data demonstrate that MSCs can detect an inflammatory microenvironment via a direct and physical interaction with innate immune cells. This finding opens different perspectives for MSC-based cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The biliary system plays an important role in several acquired and genetic disorders of the liver. We have previously shown that biliary duct epithelium contains cells giving rise to proliferative Lgr5+ organoids in vitro. However, it remained unknown whether all biliary cells or only a specific subset had this clonogenic activity. The cell surface protease ST14 was identified as a positive marker for the clonogenic subset of cholangiocytes and was used to separate clonogenic and non-clonogenic duct cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Only ST14hi duct cells had the ability to generate organoids that could be serially passaged. The gene expression profiles of clonogenic and non-clonogenic duct cells were similar, but several hundred genes were differentially expressed. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that clonogenic duct cells are interspersed among regular biliary epithelium at a ∼1:3 ratio. We conclude that adult murine cholangiocytes can be subdivided into two populations differing in their proliferative capacity.

Abstract: The carotid body (CB) is the key sensing organ for physiological oxygen levels in the body. Under conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia), the CB plays crucial roles in signaling to the cardiorespiratory center in the medulla oblongata for the restoration of oxygen homeostasis. How hypoxia regulates gene expression in the human CB remains poorly understood. While limited information on transcriptional regulation in animal CBs is available, the identity and impact of important post-transcriptional regulators such as non-coding RNAs, and in particular miRNAs are not known. Here we show using ex vivo experiments that indeed a number of miRNAs are differentially regulated in surgically removed human CB slices when acute hypoxic conditions were applied. Analysis of the hypoxia-regulated miRNAs shows that they target biological pathways with upregulation of functions related to cell proliferation and immune response and downregulation of cell differentiation and cell death functions. Comparative analysis of the human CB miRNAome with the global miRNA expression patterns of a large number of different human tissues showed that the CB miRNAome had a unique profile which reflects its highly specialized functional status. Nevertheless, the human CB miRNAome is most closely related to the miRNA expression pattern of brain tissues indicating that they may have the most similar developmental origins.

Abstract: Summary
Natural genetic diversity offers an important yet largely untapped resource to decipher the molecular mechanisms regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. Latexin (Lxn) is a negative stem cell regulatory gene identified on the basis of genetic diversity. By using an Lxn knockout mouse model, we found that Lxn inactivation in vivo led to the physiological expansion of the entire hematopoietic hierarchy. Loss of Lxn enhanced the competitive repopulation capacity and survival of HSCs in a cell-intrinsic manner. Gene profiling of Lxn-null HSCs showed altered expression of genes enriched in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Thrombospondin 1 (Thbs1) was a potential downstream target with a dramatic downregulation in Lxn-null HSCs. Enforced expression of Thbs1 restored the Lxn inactivation-mediated HSC phenotypes. This study reveals that Lxn plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostatic hematopoiesis, and it may lead to development of safe and effective approaches to manipulate HSCs for clinical benefit.

Abstract: Summary
Brain injuries, such as stroke or trauma, induce neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to a neurogenic response. Very little is known about the molecular cues that signal tissue damage, even over large distances, to the SVZ. Based on our analysis of gene expression patterns in the SVZ, 48 hr after an ischemic lesion caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion, we hypothesized that the presence of an injury might be transmitted by an astrocytic traveling calcium wave rather than by diffusible factors or hypoxia. Using a newly established in vitro system we show that calcium waves induced in an astrocytic monolayer spread to neural stem and progenitor cells and increase their self-renewal as well as migratory behavior. These changes are due to an upregulation of the Notch signaling pathway. This introduces the concept of propagating astrocytic calcium waves transmitting brain injury signals over long distances.

Abstract: Summary
During prostate development, basal and luminal cell lineages are generated through symmetric and asymmetric divisions of bipotent basal cells. However, the extent to which spindle orientation controls division symmetry or cell fate, and the upstream factors regulating this process, are still elusive. We report that GATA3 is expressed in both prostate basal progenitor and luminal cells and that loss of GATA3 leads to a mislocalization of PRKCZ, resulting in mitotic spindle randomization during progenitor cell division. Inherently proliferative intermediate progenitor cells accumulate, leading to an expansion of the luminal compartment. These defects ultimately result in a loss of tissue polarity and defective branching morphogenesis. We further show that disrupting the interaction between PRKCZ and PARD6B is sufficient to recapitulate the spindle and cell lineage phenotypes. Collectively, these results identify a critical role for GATA3 in prostate lineage specification, and further highlight the importance of regulating spindle orientation for hierarchical cell lineage organization.

Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that the chloride channel ClC-2 plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier function via intracellular trafficking of TJ protein occludin. To study the mechanism of ClC-2-mediated TJ barrier function and intracellular trafficking of occludin, we established ClC-2 over-expressing Caco-2 cell line (Caco-2CLCN2) by full length ClC-2 ORF transfection. ClC-2 over-expression (Caco-2CLCN2) significantly enhanced TJ barrier (increased TER by ≥2 times and reduced inulin flux by 50%) compared to control Caco-2pEZ cells. ClC-2 over-expression (Caco-2CLCN2) increased occludin protein level compared to control Caco-2pEZ cells. Surface biotinylation assay revealed reduced steady state endocytosis of occludin in Caco-2CLCN2 cells. Furthermore, ClC-2 over-expression led to reduction in caveolin-1 protein level and diminishment of caveolae assembly. Caveolae disruption increased TJ permeability in control but not ClC-2 over-expressing Caco-2CLCN2 cells. Selective ClC-2 channel blocker GaTx2 caused an increase in caveolin-1 protein level and reduced occludin level. Delivery of cell permeable caveolin-1 scaffolding domain reduced the occludin protein level. Over all, these results suggest that ClC- 2 enhances TJ barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells via regulation of caveolin-1 and caveolae-mediated trafficking of occludin.

Abstract: Dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family genes are known as DOCK1-DOCK11 in mammals. DOCK family proteins mainly regulate actin filament polymerization and/or depolymerization and are GEF proteins, which contribute to cellular signaling events by activating small G proteins. Sponge (Spg) is a Drosophila counterpart to mammalian DOCK3/DOCK4, and plays a role in embryonic central nervous system development, R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation, and adult thorax development. In order to conduct further functional analyses on Spg in vivo, we examined its localization in third instar larval wing imaginal discs. Immunostaining with purified anti-Spg IgG revealed that Spg mainly localized in the air sac primordium (ASP) in wing imaginal discs. Spg is therefore predicted to play an important role in the ASP. The specific knockdown of Spg by the breathless-GAL4 driver in tracheal cells induced lethality accompanied with a defect in ASP development and the induction of apoptosis. The monitoring of ERK signaling activity in wing imaginal discs by immunostaining with anti-diphospho-ERK IgG revealed reductions in the ERK signal cascade in Spg knockdown clones. Furthermore, the overexpression of D-raf suppressed defects in survival and the proliferation of cells in the ASP induced by the knockdown of Spg. Collectively, these results indicate that Spg plays a critical role in ASP development and tracheal cell viability that is mediated by the ERK signaling pathway.

Abstract: We have previously shown that palmitate causes ER stress in primary cardiomyocytes and this was associated with a diffuse lipid staining histology. In contrast, oleate, which was non-toxic, led to the formation of abundant, clearly delineated lipid droplets. The aberrant lipid histology in palmitate treated cells led us to hypothesize that perhaps there was an impairment in lipid droplet formation, which could lead to accumulation of lipids in the ER and consequent ER stress. To test this hypothesis we treated H9C2s (a cardiomyoblast cell line) with either 300µM oleate or palmitate for 8h. We found that palmitate resulted in significantly less lipid droplet abundance despite elevated intracellular lipid accumulation. Next we showed that palmitate was packaged primarily as diacylglycerol (DAG), in contrast oleate formed primarily triacylglycerol (TAG). Furthermore, the palmitate induced DAG accumulated mostly in the ER, while oleate treatment resulted in accumulation of TAG primarily in lipid droplets. The palmitate-induced accumulation of lipid in the ER was associated with a strong ER stress response. Interestingly, we found that ER stress induced by either palmitate, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin led to the degradation of Plin2, an important lipid droplet binding protein. In contrast palmitate had little effect on either Plin3 or Plin5. Furthermore, we found that acute MG132 administration significantly attenuated palmitate mediated ER stress and cell death. This protection was associated with a moderate attenuation of Plin2 degradation.

Abstract: CD147 is a multifunctional trans-membrane glycoprotein, which is highly expressed in many cancers. However, the mechanism by which CD147 modulates cell proliferation is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of CD147 in cell proliferation associated with the TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway. Here, we used cell viability and clone formation assays in LNCaP prostate cancer cells to demonstrate that CD147 promotes cell proliferation. The luciferase assay and western blotting show that silencing CD147 using shRNA enhances transcription and expression of p21WAF1. Using immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic separation, we show that this is primarily attributed to transport of Smad4 from the cytoplasm to nucleus. Other assays (GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence) demonstrate that Smad4 is a new interaction partner of CD147, with the Smad4 MH2 domain and CD147 intracellular domain (CD147-ICD) being involved in the interaction. Furthermore, we report that a phosphoserine (pSer) in CD147 (pSer252) is responsible for this interaction and inhibition of the Smad4/p21WAF1 signal that promotes cell proliferation. Our results provide a novel molecular mechanism for CD147-induced cell proliferation associated with Smad4 signal inhibition.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia correlates to aggressive disease, and while this is explained by a variety of factors, one clue to understand this phenomena was the finding that hypoxia induces a de-differentiated, stem cell-like phenotype in neuroblastoma and breast tumor cells. The hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are regulated at the translational level by fluctuating oxygen concentrations, but emerging data reveal that both HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression can be induced by aberrantly activated growth factor signaling independently of oxygen levels. Furthermore, HIF-2α is regulated by hypoxia also at the transcriptional level in neuroblastoma and glioma cells. In cultured tumor cells, HIF-2α is stabilized at physiological oxygen concentrations followed by induced expression of classical hypoxia-driven genes, resulting in a pseudohypoxic phenotype. In addition, in neuroblastoma and glioma specimens, a small subset of HIF-2α positive, HIF-1α negative, tumor cells is found adjacent to blood vessels, i.e. in areas with presumably adequate oxygenation. These tumor niches are thus pseudohypoxic, and the HIF-2α expressing cells present immature features. We have postulated that this niche in neuroblastomas encompass the tumor stem cells. Oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes associated with pseudohypoxia are frequently mutated or deleted in the germline, implicating that the pseudohypoxic phenotype indeed is tumorigenic. In summary, the hypoxic and pseudohypoxic phenotypes of solid tumors are attractive therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Bone-degrading osteoclasts are formed through fusion of their monocytic precursors. In the population of human peripheral blood monocytes, three distinct subsets have been identified: classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. We have previously shown that when the monocyte subsets are cultured on bone, significantly more osteoclasts are formed from classical monocytes than from intermediate or non-classical monocytes. Considering that this difference does not exist when monocyte subsets are cultured on plastic, we hypothesized that classical monocytes adhere better to the bone surface compared to intermediate and non-classical monocytes. To investigate this, the different monocyte subsets were isolated from human peripheral blood and cultured on slices of human bone in the presence of the cytokine M-CSF. We found that classical monocytes adhere better to bone due to a higher expression of the integrin αMβ2 and that their ability to attach to bone is significantly decreased when the integrin is blocked. This suggests that integrin αMβ2 mediates attachment of osteoclast precursors to bone and thereby enables the formation of osteoclasts.

Contrasting roles of the ABCG2 Q141K variant in prostate cancer,

Abstract: ABCG2 is a membrane transport protein that effluxes growth-promoting molecules, such as folates and dihydrotestosterone, as well as chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore it is important to determine how variants of ABCG2 affect the transporter function in order to determine whether modified treatment regimens may be necessary for patients harboring ABCG2 variants. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between the ABCG2 Q141K variant and overall survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis. We report here that in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, those who carry the ABCG2 Q141K variant had a significantly shorter time to PSA recurrence post-prostatectomy than patients homozygous for wild-type ABCG2 (P=0.01). Transport studies showed that wild-type ABCG2 was able to efflux more folic acid than the Q141K variant (P<0.002), suggesting that retained tumoral folate contributes to the decreased time to PSA recurrence in the Q141K variant patients. In a seemingly conflicting study, it was previously reported that docetaxel-treated Q141K variant prostate cancer patients have a longer survival time. We found this may be due to less efficient docetaxel efflux in cells with the Q141K variant versus wild-type ABCG2. In human prostate cancer tissues, confocal microscopy revealed that all genotypes had a mixture of cytoplasmic and plasma membrane staining, with noticeably less staining in the two homozygous KK patients. In conclusion, the Q141K variant plays contrasting roles in prostate cancer: 1) by decreasing folate efflux, increased intracellular folate levels result in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and therefore time to recurrence decreases; and 2) in patients treated with docetaxel, by decreasing its efflux, intratumoral docetaxel levels and tumor cell drug sensitivity increase and therefore patient survival time increases. Taken together, these data suggest that a patient's ABCG2 genotype may be important when determining a personalized treatment plan.

Abstract: The interaction of human small heat shock protein HspB1, its point mutants associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy, and three other small heat shock proteins (HspB5, HspB6, HspB8) with the light component of neurofilaments (NFL) was analyzed by differential centrifugation, analytical ultracentrifugation, and fluorescent spectroscopy. The wild-type HspB1 decreased the quantity of NFL in pellets obtained after low- and high-speed centrifugation and increased the quantity of NFL remaining in the supernatant after high-speed centrifugation. Part of HspB1 was detected in the pellet of NFL after high-speed centrifugation, and at saturation, 1 mol of HspB1 monomer was bound per 2 mol of NFL. Point mutants of HspB1 associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (G84R, L99M, R140G, K141Q, and P182S) were almost as effective as the wild-type HspB1 in modulation of NFL assembly. At low ionic strength, HspB1 weakly interacted with NFL tetramers, and this interaction was increased upon salt-induced polymerization of NFL. HspB1 and HspB5 (αB-crystallin) decreased the rate of NFL polymerization measured by fluorescent spectroscopy. HspB6 (Hsp20) and HspB8 (Hsp22) were less effective than HspB1 (or HspB5) in modulation of NFL assembly. The data presented indicate that the small heat shock proteins affect NFL transition from tetramers to filaments, hydrodynamic properties of filaments, and their bundling and therefore probably modulate the formation of intermediate filament networks in neurons.

Abstract: HSPC1 is a critical protein in cancer development and progression, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, clinical trial data reporting the effectiveness of HSPC1 inhibitors on several cancer types has not been as successful as predicted. Furthermore, some N-terminal inhibitors appear to be much more successful than others despite similar underlying mechanisms. This study involved the application of three N-terminal HSPC1 inhibitors, 17-DMAG, NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990 on CRC cells. The effects on client protein levels over time were examined. HSPC1 inhibitors were also applied in combination with chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in CRC treatment (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan). As HSPA1A and HSPB1 have anti-apoptotic activity, gene-silencing techniques were employed to investigate the significance of these proteins in HSPC1 inhibitor and chemotherapeutic agent resistance. When comparing the action of the three HSPC1 inhibitors, there are distinct differences in the time course of important client protein degradation events. The differences between HSPC1 inhibitors were also reflected in combination treatment—17-DMAG was more effective compared with NVP-AUY922 in potentiating the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. This study concludes that there are distinct differences between N-terminal HSPC1 inhibitors, despite their common mode of action. Although treatment with each of the inhibitors results in significant induction of the anti-apoptotic proteins HSPA1A and HSPB1, sensitivity to HSPC1 inhibitors is not improved by gene silencing of HSPA1A or HSPB1. HSPC1 inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents in CRC, and this approach is readily available to enter clinical trials. From a translational point of view, there may be great variability in sensitivity to the inhibitors between individual patients.

Abstract: Summary
Connexin43 (CX43), a protein that forms gap junction channels and hemichannels in astrocytes, is downregulated in high-grade gliomas. Its relevance for glioma therapy has been thoroughly explored; however, its positive effects on proliferation are counterbalanced by its effects on migration and invasion. Here, we show that a cell-penetrating peptide based on CX43 (TAT-Cx43266-283) inhibited c-Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and upregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog in glioma stem cells (GSCs) derived from patients. Consequently, TAT-Cx43266-283 reduced GSC motility, as analyzed by time-lapse microscopy, and strongly reduced their invasive ability. Interestingly, we investigated the effects of TAT-Cx43266-283 on freshly removed surgical specimens as undissociated glioblastoma blocks, which revealed a dramatic reduction in the growth, migration, and survival of these cells. In conclusion, a region of CX43 (amino acids 266–283) exerts an important anti-tumor effect in patient-derived glioblastoma models that includes impairment of GSC migration and invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the processes that govern liver progenitor cell differentiation has important implications for the design of strategies targeting chronic liver diseases, whereby regeneration of liver tissue is critical. Although DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) are highly dynamic during early embryonic development, less is known about their roles at later stages of differentiation. Using an in vitro model of hepatocyte differentiation, we show here that 5hmC precedes the expression of promoter 1 (P1)-dependent isoforms of HNF4A, a master transcription factor of hepatocyte identity. 5hmC and HNF4A expression from P1 are dependent on ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases. In turn, the liver pioneer factor FOXA2 is necessary for TET1 binding to the P1 locus. Both FOXA2 and TETs are required for the 5hmC-related switch in HNF4A expression. The epigenetic event identified here may be a key step for the establishment of the hepatocyte program by HNF4A.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in oocyte quality can have great impact on the developmental potential of early embryos. Here we test whether nuclear genome transfer from a developmentally incompetent to a developmentally competent oocyte can restore developmental potential. Using in vitro oocyte aging as a model system we performed nuclear transfer in mouse oocytes at metaphase II or at the first interphase, and observed that development to the blastocyst stage and to term was as efficient as in control embryos. The increased developmental potential is explained primarily by correction of abnormal cytokinesis at anaphase of meiosis and mitosis, by a reduction in chromosome segregation errors, and by normalization of the localization of chromosome passenger complex components survivin and cyclin B1. These observations demonstrate that developmental decline is primarily due to abnormal function of cytoplasmic factors involved in cytokinesis, while the genome remains developmentally fully competent.

Abstract: Summary
Conversion of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes represents a potential means of restoring cardiac function after myocardial infarction, but so far this process remains inefficient and little is known about its molecular mechanisms. Here we show that DAPT, a classical Notch inhibitor, enhances the conversion of mouse fibroblasts into induced cardiac-like myocytes by the transcription factors GATA4, HAND2, MEF2C, and TBX5. DAPT cooperates with AKT kinase to further augment this process, resulting in up to 70% conversion efficiency. Moreover, DAPT promotes the acquisition of specific cardiomyocyte features, substantially increasing calcium flux, sarcomere structure, and the number of spontaneously beating cells. Transcriptome analysis shows that DAPT induces genetic programs related to muscle development, differentiation, and excitation-contraction coupling. Mechanistically, DAPT increases binding of the transcription factor MEF2C to the promoter regions of cardiac structural genes. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the reprogramming process and may have important implications for cardiac regeneration therapies.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) is closely related with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which has been involved in tumourigenesis. However, there has been little research into the role of USP18 on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in HBV-related HCC. In present study, we found that USP18 expression was aberrantly elevated in HCC tissues than adjacent non-tumour tissues. Importantly, USP18 expression was higher in HBV-related HCC cell lines (HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B) than HBV-unrelated HCC cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of USP18 significantly suppressed tumour cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo, whereas overexpression of USP18 promoted HCC cells growth. Moreover, our experimental data revealed that USP18 silencing obviously blocked cell cycle at G1 phase and increased cell apoptosis. Finally, BCL2L1, a member of BCL2 family protein, was identified as a downstream gene of USP18. Mechanistically, we found that USP18 directly bind to BCL2L1 and positively regulated its expression in HCC cells. Overall, our results suggested that USP18 has a crucial role in regulating diverse aspects of the pathogenesis of HCC, indicating that it might be a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: The holdase activity and oligomeric propensity of human small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are regulated by environmental factors. However, atomic-level details are lacking for the mechanisms by which stressors alter sHSP responses. We previously demonstrated that regulation of HSPB5 is mediated by a single conserved histidine over a physiologically relevant pH range of 6.5–7.5. Here, we demonstrate that HSPB1 responds to pH via a similar mechanism through pH-dependent structural changes that are induced via protonation of the structurally analogous histidine. Results presented here show that acquisition of a positive charge, either by protonation of His124 or its substitution by lysine, reduces the stability of the dimer interface of the α-crystallin domain, increases oligomeric size, and modestly increases chaperone activity. Our results suggest a conserved mechanism of pH-dependent structural regulation among the human sHSPs that possess the conserved histidine, although the functional consequences of the structural modulations vary for different sHSPs.

Abstract: Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis regulates cellular levels of various proteins, and therefore plays important roles in controlling cell signaling and disease progression. The Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP is recognized as an important negative regulator for numerous key signaling proteins. Recently, the deubiquitinases (DUBs) have turned out to be essential to regulate signaling pathways related to human diseases. However, whether β-TrCP is able to regulate the deubiquitinase family members remains largely unexplored. Here, we found that β-TrCP downregulated cellular levels of endogenous USP33. We also revealed that β-TrCP interacted with USP33 independently of the classic binding motif for β-TrCP, and mediated USP33 degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we found that the WD40 motif of β-TrCP and 201–400 amino acid motif of USP33 are required for the interaction between β-TrCP and USP33. Consequently, β-TrCP attenuated USP33-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and cell invasion. Taken together, our study clarified that the E3 ligase β-TrCP regulates cellular USP33 levels by the ubiquitin-proteasomal proteolysis.

Abstract: Amyloid β (Aβ) is a critical stimulator that promotes the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by Aβ is estimated to be responsible for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in such disease. Puerarin, one of the major active constituents of Kudzu root, has been widely used in the clinical treatment of AMD in China for decades; however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains far from clear. In this study, we investigated the protective effect and underlying mechanism of puerarin against Aβ1–40-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. The results showed that Aβ1–40 induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation mainly via triggering ROS-dependent oxidative stress, particularly lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells; however, such effect could be significantly reversed by puerarin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effect of puerarin was potentially mediated through activating Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway and inhibiting Aβ1–40-induced phosphorylation of IRE1 and PERK as well as nuclear expression of ATF6α. Therefore, the significance of the current study is to reveal the novel mechanism of puerarin in the prevention of AMD.

Abstract: Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for a distinct form of congestive heart failure, known as alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM). Here, we investigate how microRNAs may participate in the induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis associated with ethanol exposure in vitro. Increasing the concentrations of ethanol to primary rat cardiomyocytes resulted in elevated apoptosis assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining, and reduced expression of an enzyme for alcohol detoxification aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). These ethanol effects were accompanied by a substantial elevation of miR-378a-5p. Driving miR-378a-5p overexpression in cardiomyocytes decreased ALDH2. The specific interaction of miR-378a-5p with the 3’UTR of ALDH2 was examined by luciferase reporter assays, and we found that miR-378a-5p activity depends on a complementary base pairing at the 3′-UTR region of ALDH2 mRNA. Finally, ethanol-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes was attenuated in the presence of anti-miR378a-5p. Collectively, these data implicate a likely involvement of miR-378a-5p in the stimulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis through ALDH2 gene suppression, which might play a potential role in the pathogenesis of ACM.

Abstract: Casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1(CKIP-1) is widely expressed in a variety of tissues and cells, and plays an important role in various critical cellular and physiological processes including cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, cytoskeleton and bone formation. Here, we found: (1) CKIP-1 deficient mice exhibited increased body weight, liver weight, number and size of lipid droplets, and TG content comparing with WT mice after being exposed to high fat diet (HFD); (2) the levels of serum insulin, liver glycogen, phosphorylated C-Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (pJNK1) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate −1(pIRS1) in CKIP-1-/- mice were higher than those of WT mice; (3) CKIP-1 interacted with JNK1 in vitro. Our results indicate that CKIP-1 deficiency in mice aggravates HFD-induced fatty liver by upregulating JNK1 phosphorylation and further upregulating IRS-1 phosphorylation and RI.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale collections of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could serve as powerful model systems for examining how genetic variation affects biology and disease. Here we describe the iPSCORE resource: a collection of systematically derived and characterized iPSC lines from 222 ethnically diverse individuals that allows for both familial and association-based genetic studies. iPSCORE lines are pluripotent with high genomic integrity (no or low numbers of somatic copy-number variants) as determined using high-throughput RNA-sequencing and genotyping arrays, respectively. Using iPSCs from a family of individuals, we show that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrate gene expression patterns that cluster by genetic background, and can be used to examine variants associated with physiological and disease phenotypes. The iPSCORE collection contains representative individuals for risk and non-risk alleles for 95% of SNPs associated with human phenotypes through genome-wide association studies. Our study demonstrates the utility of iPSCORE for examining how genetic variants influence molecular and physiological traits in iPSCs and derived cell lines.

Abstract: Investigation into the regulation of the erythropoietin gene by oxygen led to the discovery of a process of direct oxygen sensing that transduces many cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. The oxygen-sensitive signal is generated through the catalytic action of a series of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that regulate the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by the post-translational hydroxylation of specific amino acid residues. Here we review the implications of the unforeseen complexity of the HIF transcriptional cascade for the physiology and pathophysiology of hypoxia, and consider the origins of post-translational hydroxylation as a signaling process.
