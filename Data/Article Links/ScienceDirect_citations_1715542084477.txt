Abstract: Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons are the key to finely tune the voluntary movement, habit and motivation. The progressive and selective degeneration of these neurons is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The susceptibility of DA neurons in the SNpc may result from differences in how Ca2+ is handled. However, very little information is available about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in DA neurons. In this study, the relative contributions of various Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and their interplay with internal Ca2+ stores, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria, in the regulation of the [Ca2+]i of mouse mesencephalic neurons were characterized. Both the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCKX) and the K+-independent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can be detected and are functional in DA and non-DA neurons. NCX accounts for the larger component of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis showed each individual neuron expressed a distinct set of the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Furthermore, the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers play prominent roles in removing [Ca2+]i induced by glutamate but not [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization. The mitochondria serve as a major Ca2+ sink and are functionally located close to NCX. In contrast, the ER is functionally located close to NCKX and acts primarily as a Ca2+ source with marginal effects. This study reveals that the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, the ER and the mitochondria, which cooperate interactively, act similarly when regulating [Ca2+]i in mesencephalic DA and non-DA neurons. The heterogeneous expression of multiple types of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and the quantitative differences found in [Ca2+]i regulation, together with other risk factors specific to DA neurons such as dopamine oxidation resulting in oxidative stress, may drive these cells to undergo selective degeneration.

Abstract: Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and calcium homeostasis has been implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The cytosolic calcium concentration is maintained by store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is repressed by Alzheimer’s disease-associated mutants, such as mutant presenilins. We hypothesized that inhibition of UPS impacts SOCE. This study showed that pretreatment with sub-lethal levels of proteasome inhibitors, including MG-132 and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (LA), reduced SOCE after depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium in rat neurons. With the same treatment, MG-132 and LA reduced the protein levels of stromal interaction molecule 1and 2 (STIM1/2), but not the levels of Orai1 and canonical transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1). STIM1 or STIM2 protein was mobilized to lysosome by MG-132/LA treatment as observed under an immunofluorescence confocal laser microscope. In the neurons, MG-132 and LA degraded p62/SQSTM1, promoted autophagy, converted LC3I to LC3II, and promoted co-localization of LC3 and lysosomes. Rapamycin, which enhances autophagy, reduced STIM1/2 protein levels, whereas bafilomycin, which inhibits autophagy, increased their protein levels. The protein levels of STIM1/2 and the amplitude of SOCE were decreased in SH-SY5Y with decreased protein level of proteasome subunit beta type-5 induced by shRNA. We conclude that sub-lethal levels of proteasome inhibition reduce SOCE and promote autophagy-mediated degradation of STIM1/2. UPS inhibition, a common finding in neurodegenerative diseases, interferes with calcium homeostasis via repression of SOCE.

Abstract: Summary
High abundance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is linked to lower glycaemia in humans, leading to the belief that BAT may protect against diabetes. The relationship between BAT glucose utilization and systemic glucose homeostasis has not been defined. In this paper we have characterized glycaemic excursions and BAT thermogenic responses in human brown adipocytes, BAT explants, and healthy adults through supraclavicular temperature profiling, revealing their circadian coupling in vivo and in vitro, orchestrated by UCP1, GLUT4, and Rev-erbα biorhythms. Extent of glycated haemoglobin also correlated positively with environmental temperature among community-dwelling patients. These data uncover potential crosstalk between BAT and glucose regulatory pathways, evident on cellular, tissue, individual, and population levels, and provide impetus to search for BAT harnessing strategies for therapeutic purposes.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-infected individuals are living longer on antiretroviral therapy, but many patients display signs that in some ways resemble premature aging. To investigate and quantify the impact of chronic HIV infection on aging, we report a global analysis of the whole-blood DNA methylomes of 137 HIV+ individuals under sustained therapy along with 44 matched HIV− individuals. First, we develop and validate epigenetic models of aging that are independent of blood cell composition. Using these models, we find that both chronic and recent HIV infection lead to an average aging advancement of 4.9 years, increasing expected mortality risk by 19%. In addition, sustained infection results in global deregulation of the methylome across >80,000 CpGs and specific hypomethylation of the region encoding the human leukocyte antigen locus (HLA). We find that decreased HLA methylation is predictive of lower CD4 / CD8 T cell ratio, linking molecular aging, epigenetic regulation, and disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis is a cell death pathway regulated by the receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase. How MLKL executes plasma membrane rupture upon phosphorylation by RIPK3 remains controversial. Here, we characterize the hierarchical transduction of structural changes in MLKL that culminate in necroptosis. The MLKL brace, proximal to the N-terminal helix bundle (NB), is involved in oligomerization to facilitate plasma membrane targeting through the low-affinity binding of NB to phosphorylated inositol polar head groups of phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) phospholipids. At the membrane, the NB undergoes a “rolling over” mechanism to expose additional higher-affinity PIP-binding sites responsible for robust association to the membrane and displacement of the brace from the NB. PI(4,5)P2 is the preferred PIP-binding partner. We investigate the specific association of MLKL with PIPs and subsequent structural changes during necroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The kidney has a tremendous capacity to regenerate following injury, but factors that govern this response are still largely unknown. We isolated cells from mouse kidneys with high proliferative and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. These cells expressed a high level of Sox9. In regenerating kidneys, Sox9 expression was induced early, and 89% of proliferating cells were Sox9 positive. In vitro, Sox9-positive cells showed unlimited proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. Using an inducible Sox9 Cre line and lineage-tagging methods, we show that Sox9-positive cells can generate new daughter cells, contributing to the regeneration of proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule segments but not to collecting duct and glomerular cells. Furthermore, inducible deletion of Sox9 resulted in reduced epithelial proliferation, more severe injury, and fibrosis development. In summary, we demonstrate that, in the kidney, Sox9-positive cells show progenitor-like properties in vitro and contribute to epithelial regeneration following injury in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) induces mesenchymal (MES) transdifferentiation and radioresistance in glioma stem cells (GSCs), but molecular mechanisms for NF-κB activation in GSCs are currently unknown. Here, we report that mixed lineage kinase 4 (MLK4) is overexpressed in MES but not proneural (PN) GSCs. Silencing MLK4 suppresses self-renewal, motility, tumorigenesis, and radioresistance of MES GSCs via a loss of the MES signature. MLK4 binds and phosphorylates the NF-κB regulator IKKα, leading to activation of NF-κB signaling in GSCs. MLK4 expression is inversely correlated with patient prognosis in MES, but not PN high-grade gliomas. Collectively, our results uncover MLK4 as an upstream regulator of NF-κB signaling and a potential molecular target for the MES subtype of glioblastomas.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neurogenesis plays increasingly recognized roles in brain homeostasis and repair and is profoundly affected by energy balance and nutrients. We found that the expression of Hes-1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) is modulated in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) by extracellular glucose through the coordinated action of CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein) and Sirt-1 (Sirtuin 1), two cellular nutrient sensors. Excess glucose reduced CREB-activated Hes-1 expression and results in impaired cell proliferation. CREB-deficient NSCs expanded poorly in vitro and did not respond to glucose availability. Elevated glucose also promoted Sirt-1-dependent repression of the Hes-1 promoter. Conversely, in low glucose, CREB replaced Sirt-1 on the chromatin associated with the Hes-1 promoter enhancing Hes-1 expression and cell proliferation. Thus, the glucose-regulated antagonism between CREB and Sirt-1 for Hes-1 transcription participates in the metabolic regulation of neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a chromatin-modifying enzyme, requires association with the deacetylase-containing domain (DAD) of the nuclear receptor corepressors NCOR1 and SMRT for its stability and activity. Here, we show that aldose reductase (AR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway, competes with HDAC3 to bind the NCOR1/SMRT DAD. Increased AR expression leads to HDAC3 degradation followed by increased PPARγ signaling, resulting in lipid accumulation in the heart. AR also downregulates expression of nuclear corepressor complex cofactors including Gps2 and Tblr1, thus affecting activity of the nuclear corepressor complex itself. Though AR reduces HDAC3-corepressor complex formation, it specifically derepresses the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), but not other nuclear receptors such as the thyroid receptor (TR) and liver X receptor (LXR). In summary, this work defines a distinct role for AR in lipid and retinoid metabolism through HDAC3 regulation and consequent derepression of PPARγ and RAR.

Abstract: Summary
The quest to extend healthspan via pharmacological means is becoming increasingly urgent, both from a health and economic perspective. Here we show that lithium, a drug approved for human use, promotes longevity and healthspan. We demonstrate that lithium extends lifespan in female and male Drosophila, when administered throughout adulthood or only later in life. The life-extending mechanism involves the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF-2). Combining genetic loss of the NRF-2 repressor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) with lithium treatment revealed that high levels of NRF-2 activation conferred stress resistance, while low levels additionally promoted longevity. The discovery of GSK-3 as a therapeutic target for aging will likely lead to more effective treatments that can modulate mammalian aging and further improve health in later life.

Abstract: Strontium ranelate (SR) is the first generation of a new class of medication for osteoporosis, which is capable of inducing bone formation and, to a certain extent, inhibiting bone resorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of SR on osteoblastic cell cultures. MC3TE-E1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2×104 cells/well and exposed to SR at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5mM. The following parameters were assayed: 1) Cell proliferation by hemocytometer counting after 24, 48 and 72h, 2) Cell viability by MTT assay after 24, 48 and 72h, 3) Type I Collagen and Osteopontin (OPN) quantification by Western Blotting, ELISA, and Real Time PCR after 48h, 3) Immunolocalization of fibronectin (FN) by epifluorescence, and 4) matrix mineralization by Alizarin Red staining after 14days. After 24, 48 and 72h, the cell proliferation and viability were not affected by SR at 0.05 and 0.1mM (p>0.05). However, cell cultures exposed to SR at 0.5mM exhibited a decrease in both cell proliferation and cell viability in all time points assayed (p<0.05). High levels of protein and mRNA for Type I Collagen and OPN were detected in cultures exposed to SR, particularly at 0.5mM (p<0.05). SR allowed the expression of FN in osteoblastic cell cultures as observed by epifluorescence analysis. The mineralized bone-like nodule formation was affected in a concentration-dependent manner by SR, with large bone-like nodules being detected in osteoblastic cell cultures exposed to SR at 0.5mM. In conclusion, these results suggest that SR can accelerate acquisition of the osteoblastic phenotype, which explains, at least in part, the rebalancing of bone turnover in favor of bone formation.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-12 (IL-12), produced by dendritic cells in response to activation, is central to pathogen eradication and tumor rejection. The trafficking pathways controlling spatial distribution and intracellular transport of IL-12 vesicles to the cell surface are still unknown. Here, we show that intracellular IL-12 localizes in late endocytic vesicles marked by the SNARE VAMP7. Dendritic cells (DCs) from VAMP7-deficient mice are partially impaired in the multidirectional release of IL-12. Upon encounter with antigen-specific T cells, IL-12-containing vesicles rapidly redistribute at the immune synapse and release IL-12 in a process entirely dependent on VAMP7 expression. Consistently, acquisition of effector functions is reduced in T cells stimulated by VAMP7-null DCs. These results provide insights into IL-12 intracellular trafficking pathways and show that VAMP7-mediated release of IL-12 at the immune synapse is a mechanism to transmit innate signals to T cells.

Abstract: Coumarin is a phenolic compound that mainly affects the liver due to its metabolization into a toxic compound. The deterrent and ovicidal activities of coumarin in insect models such as Drosophila melanogaster have been reported. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms by which these insects protect themselves and their eggs from this toxic plant metabolite. Coumarin was fatal to the flies in a dosage-dependent manner. However, coumarin feeding could be inhibited through activation of the aversive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), but not the olfactory receptor neurons. Furthermore, three gustatory receptors, GR33a, GR66a, and GR93a, functioned together in coumarin detection by the proboscis. However, GR33a, but not GR66a and GR93a, was required to avoid coumarin during oviposition, with a choice of the same substrates provided as in binary food choice assay. Taken together, these findings suggest that anti-feeding activity and ovi- position to avoid coumarin occur via separate mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Initial pathway alternations required for pathogenesis of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are poorly understood. Here we reveal that removal of glycogen synthase kinase-3α (GSK-3α) and GSK-3β dependency leads to aggressive AML. Although GSK-3α deletion alone has no effect, GSK-3β deletion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) resulted in a pre-neoplastic state consistent with human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Transcriptome and functional studies reveal that each GSK-3β and GSK-3α uniquely contributes to AML by affecting Wnt/Akt/mTOR signaling and metabolism, respectively. The molecular signature of HSCs deleted for GSK-3β provided a prognostic tool for disease progression and survival of MDS patients. Our study reveals that GSK-3α- and GSK-3β-regulated pathways can be responsible for stepwise transition to MDS and subsequent AML, thereby providing potential therapeutic targets of disease evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle regeneration relies on a pool of resident muscle stem cells called satellite cells (MuSCs). Following injury-induced destruction of the myofibers, quiescent MuSCs are activated and generate transient amplifying progenitors (myoblasts) that will fuse to form new myofibers. Here, we focus on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and find that either conditional β-catenin disruption or activation in adult MuSCs results in perturbation of muscle regeneration. Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we observed that myoblasts lacking β-catenin show delayed differentiation, whereas myoblasts with constitutively active β-catenin undergo precocious growth arrest and differentiation. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling interacts with multiple pathways and, more specifically, TGF-β signaling. Indeed, exogenous TGF-β2 stimulation restores the regenerative potential of muscles with targeted β-catenin disruption in MuSCs. We conclude that a precise level of β-catenin activity is essential for regulating the amplification and differentiation of MuSC descendants during adult myogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mammary epithelial cells transition between periods of proliferation and quiescence during development, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy, and as a result of oncogenic transformation. Utilizing an organotypic 3D tissue culture model coupled with quantitative metabolomics and proteomics, we identified significant differences in glutamate utilization between proliferating and quiescent cells. Relative to quiescent cells, proliferating cells catabolized more glutamate via transaminases to couple non-essential amino acid (NEAA) synthesis to α-ketoglutarate generation and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis. As cells transitioned to quiescence, glutamine consumption and transaminase expression were reduced, while glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) was induced, leading to decreased NEAA synthesis. Highly proliferative human tumors display high transaminase and low GLUD expression, suggesting that proliferating cancer cells couple glutamine consumption to NEAA synthesis to promote biosynthesis. These findings describe a competitive and partially redundant relationship between transaminases and GLUD, and they reveal how coupling of glutamate-derived carbon and nitrogen metabolism can be regulated to support cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
We present simple and efficient methods for creating heritable modifications of the zebrafish genome. Precisely modified alleles are generated by homologous recombination between the host genome and dsDNA donor molecules, stimulated by the induction of chromosomally targeted double-strand breaks. Several kilobase-long tracts of genome sequence can be replaced. Tagging donor sequences with reporter genes that can be subsequently excised improves recovery of edited alleles by an order of magnitude and facilitates recovery of recessive and phenotypically silent conditional mutations. We generate and demonstrate functionality of (1) alleles with a single codon change, (2) an allele encoding an epitope-tagged version of an endogenous protein, (3) alleles expressing reporter proteins, and (4) a conditional allele in which an exon is flanked by recombinogenic loxP sites. Our methods make recovery of a broad range of genome editing events very practicable, significantly advancing applicability of the zebrafish for studying normal biological processes and modeling diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Learning and memory formation in Drosophila rely on a network of neurons in the mushroom bodies (MBs). Whereas numerous studies have delineated roles for individual cell types within this network in aspects of learning or memory, whether or not these cells can also be distinguished by the genes they express remains unresolved. In addition, the changes in gene expression that accompany long-term memory formation within the MBs have not yet been studied by neuron type. Here, we address both issues by performing RNA sequencing on single cell types (harvested via patch pipets) within the MB. We discover that the expression of genes that encode cell surface receptors is sufficient to identify cell types and that a subset of these genes, required for sensory transduction in peripheral sensory neurons, is not only expressed within individual neurons of the MB in the central brain, but is also critical for memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
In order to facilitate the identification of factors and pathways in the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage, several descriptive proteomic screens and a functional genomics screen were performed in parallel. Numerous factors could be identified with high confidence when the screen results were superimposed and interpreted together, incorporating biological knowledge. A searchable database, bioLOGIC, which provides access to relevant information about a protein or process of interest, was established to host the results and facilitate data mining. Besides uncovering roles in the DNA damage response for numerous proteins and complexes, including Integrator, Cohesin, PHF3, ASC-1, SCAF4, SCAF8, and SCAF11, we uncovered a role for the poorly studied, melanoma-associated serine/threonine kinase 19 (STK19). Besides effectively uncovering relevant factors, the multiomic approach also provides a systems-wide overview of the diverse cellular processes connected to the transcription-related DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
The steady-state airway epithelium has a low rate of stem cell turnover but can nevertheless mount a rapid proliferative response following injury. This suggests a mechanism to restrain proliferation at steady state. One such mechanism has been identified in skeletal muscle in which pro-proliferative FGFR1 signaling is antagonized by SPRY1 to maintain satellite cell quiescence. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of Fgfr1 or Spry2 in basal cells of the adult mouse trachea caused an increase in steady-state proliferation. We show that in airway basal cells, SPRY2 is post-translationally modified in response to FGFR1 signaling. This allows SPRY2 to inhibit intracellular signaling downstream of other receptor tyrosine kinases and restrain basal cell proliferation. An FGFR1-SPRY2 signaling axis has previously been characterized in cell lines in vitro. We now demonstrate an in vivo biological function of this interaction and thus identify an active signaling mechanism that maintains quiescence in the airway epithelium.

Abstract: Sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are closely associated specialized vascular cells residing in the hepatic sinusoid. These cells have been shown to play important roles in many different pathophysiologic processes, in particular in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Caveolin-1 functions as a scaffolding protein, and has a variety of functions including in many disease states, such as liver cirrhosis. Although previous studies have shown that in the injured rat liver, caveolin-1 is upregulated, the precise cells in which remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the cell type (or types) in which caveolin-1 is expressed in normal and injured rat liver. We have utilized both detailed immunohistochemical labeling with cell specific markers as well as cell isolation techniques (isolating sinusoidal endothelial cells, HSCs, and hepatocytes) in normal and injured (bile duct ligation) rat liver. We show here that in the normal liver caveolin-1 is expressed predominantly in HSCs and SECs but after liver injury there is upregulation of caveolin-1 in HSCs, but not in SECs. These data have functional implications for the cells in which caveolin-1 is regulated.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt/β-catenin activation in adult epidermis can induce new hair follicle formation and tumor development. We used lineage tracing to uncover the relative contribution of different stem cell populations. LGR6+ and LRIG1+ stem cells contributed to ectopic hair follicles formed in the sebaceous gland upon β-catenin activation, whereas LGR5+ cells did not. Lgr6, but not Lrig1 or Lgr5, was expressed in a subpopulation of interfollicular epidermal cells that were competent to form new hair follicles. Oncogenic β-catenin expression in LGR5+ cells led to formation of pilomatricomas, while LRIG1+ cells formed trichoadenomas and LGR6+ cells formed dermatofibromas. Tumor formation was always accompanied by a local increase in dermal fibroblast density and transient extracellular matrix remodeling. However, each tumor had a distinct stromal signature in terms of immune cell infiltrate and expression of CD26 and CD44. We conclude that compartmentalization of epidermal stem cells underlies different responses to β-catenin and skin tumor heterogeneity.

Angelica polymorpha Maxim Induces Apoptosis of Human SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells by Regulating an Intrinsic Caspase Pathway,

Abstract: Angelica polymorpha Maxim root extract (APRE) is a popular herbal medicine used for treating stomachache, abdominal pain, stomach ulcers, and rheumatism; however the effect of APRE on cancer cells has not yet been explored. Here, we examined APRE cytotoxicity seen on target neuroblastoma cells (NB) using cell viability assays, DAPI visualization of fragmented DNA, and Western blotting analysis of candidate signaling pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis. We demonstrated that APRE reduced cell viability in NB to a greater extent than in fibroblast cells. In addition, we found that APRE could inhibit the three classes of MAPK proteins and could also down-regulate the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β activity all being relevant for proliferation and survival. APRE could also up-regulate Bax expression and down-regulate Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. With APRE treatment, depolarization of mitochondria membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 was demonstrated in the SH-SY5Y cells. We could not found increased activity of death receptor and caspase-8 as markers of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway for the APRE treated cells. In presence of a caspase-3 siRNA and a pan-caspase inhibitor, APRE could not reduce the viability of NB cells to a significant degree. So we predicted that with APRE, the intrinsic pathway was solely responsible for inducing apoptosis as we also showed that the non-caspase autophagy pathway or ER stress-ROS mediated pathways were not involved. These findings demonstrate that an intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway mediates the apoptotic effects of APRE on SH-SY5Y cells, and that APRE shows promise as a novel agent for neuroblastoma therapy.

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, 2015 registered more than 1.206.172 cases of Dengue in the Americas. Recently, the Aedes aegypti has been not only related to Dengue, but also with cases of Zika virus and Chikungunya. Due to its epidemiological importance, this study characterized the morphology of the embryonated eggs of A. aegypti and provided a protocol to culture stem cells from eggs and digestive tract of fourth instar larvae in order to examine cell biology and expression of markers in these vectors. Cells were isolated and cultured in DMEM-High at 28°C, and their morphology, cell cycle and immunophenotyping were examined. Morphologically, embryos were at the end of the embryonic period and showed: head, thorax, and abdomen with eight abdominal segments. The embryonic tissues expressed markers related to cell proliferation (PCNA), pluripotency (Sox2 and OCT3/4), neural cells (Nestin), mesenchymal cells (Vimentin and Stro-1), and endosomal cells (GM130 and RAB5). In culture, cells from both tissues (eggs and larvae gut) were composed by a heterogeneous population. The cells had a globoid shape and small size. Cell cycle analysis on passage 1 (P1) showed 27.5%±2.0% of cell debris, 68% of cells on G0-G1 phase, 30.2% on S phase, 1.9%±0.5% on G2-M phase. In addition, cells on passage 2 showed: 10% of cell debris, 92.4% of cells on G0-G1 phase, 6.8% on S phase, 0.6% on G2-M phase. Embryonated eggs expressed markers involved with pluripotency (Sox2 and Oct 3/4), mesenchymal cells (vimentin and Stro-1), neural cells (Nestin), and cellular death by apoptosis (Caspase 3). Specific endosomal markers for insect cells (GM130 and RAB5) were also highly expressed. In cell culture of A. aegypti larvae gut the same labeling pattern was observed, with a small decrease in the expression of mesenchymal (vimentin and Stro-1) and neural (Nestin) markers. In summary, we were able to establish a protocol to culture embryonated eggs and larvae gut of A. aegypti, describing the characteristics of undifferentiated cells, as well as the cell cycle and expression of markers, which can be used for biotechnology studies for the biological control of this vector.

Abstract: Summary
Active-targeted delivery to lymph nodes represents a major advance toward more effective treatment of immune-mediated disease. The MECA79 antibody recognizes peripheral node addressin molecules expressed by high endothelial venules of lymph nodes. By mimicking lymphocyte trafficking to the lymph nodes, we have engineered MECA79-coated microparticles containing an immunosuppressive medication, tacrolimus. Following intravenous administration, MECA79-bearing particles showed marked accumulation in the draining lymph nodes of transplanted animals. Using an allograft heart transplant model, we show that targeted lymph node delivery of microparticles containing tacrolimus can prolong heart allograft survival with negligible changes in tacrolimus serum level. Using MECA79 conjugation, we have demonstrated targeted delivery of tacrolimus to the lymph nodes following systemic administration, with the capacity for immune modulation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Patterning by morphogen gradients relies on the capacity to generate reproducible distribution profiles. Morphogen spread depends on kinetic parameters, including diffusion and degradation rates, which vary between embryos, raising the question of how variability is controlled. We examined this in the context of Toll-dependent dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo. We find that low embryo-to-embryo variability in DV patterning relies on wntD, a Toll-target gene expressed initially at the posterior pole. WntD protein is secreted and disperses in the extracellular milieu, associates with its receptor Frizzled4, and inhibits the Toll pathway by blocking the Toll extracellular domain. Mathematical modeling predicts that WntD accumulates until the Toll gradient narrows to its desired spread, and we support this feedback experimentally. This circuit exemplifies a broadly applicable induction-contraction mechanism, which reduces patterning variability through a restricted morphogen-dependent expression of a secreted diffusible inhibitor.

Abstract: Summary
Despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology determining systemic energy homeostasis, the treatment of obesity remains a medical challenge. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed as an attractive strategy for the treatment of obesity and its complications. AMPK is a conserved, ubiquitously expressed, heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase whose short-term activation has multiple beneficial metabolic effects. Whether these translate into long-term benefits for obesity and its complications is unknown. Here, we observe that mice with chronic AMPK activation, resulting from mutation of the AMPK γ2 subunit, exhibit ghrelin signaling-dependent hyperphagia, obesity, and impaired pancreatic islet insulin secretion. Humans bearing the homologous mutation manifest a congruent phenotype. Our studies highlight that long-term AMPK activation throughout all tissues can have adverse metabolic consequences, with implications for pharmacological strategies seeking to chronically activate AMPK systemically to treat metabolic disease.

The Specification of Geometric Edges by a Plant Rab GTPase Is an Essential Cell-Patterning Principle During Organogenesis in Arabidopsis,

Abstract: Summary
Plant organogenesis requires control over division planes and anisotropic cell wall growth, which each require spatial patterning of cells. Polyhedral plant cells can display complex patterning in which individual faces are established as biochemically distinct domains by endomembrane trafficking. We now show that, during organogenesis, the Arabidopsis endomembrane system specifies an important additional cellular spatial domain: the geometric edges. Previously unidentified membrane vesicles lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane at cell edges were revealed through localization of RAB-A5c, a plant GTPase of the Rab family of membrane-trafficking regulators. Specific inhibition of RAB-A5c activity grossly perturbed cell geometry in developing lateral organs by interfering independently with growth anisotropy and cytokinesis without disrupting default membrane trafficking. The initial loss of normal cell geometry can be explained by a failure to maintain wall stiffness specifically at geometric edges. RAB-A5c thus meets a requirement to specify this cellular spatial domain during organogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Ample evidence suggests that α-synuclein is released from cells and propagated from one area of the brain to others via cell-to-cell transmission. In terms of their prion-like behavior, α-synuclein propagation plays key roles in the pathogenesis and progression of α-synucleinopathies. Using α-synuclein-enriched models, we show that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) inhibited α-synuclein transmission by blocking the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of extracellular α-synuclein via modulation of the interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, which led to a prosurvival effect on cortical and dopaminergic neurons with functional improvement of motor deficits in α-synuclein-enriched models. Furthermore, we identify that galectin-1, a soluble factor derived from MSCs, played an important role in the transmission control of aggregated α-synuclein in these models. The present data indicated that MSCs exert neuroprotective properties through inhibition of extracellular α-synuclein transmission, suggesting that the property of MSCs may act as a disease-modifying therapy in subjects with α-synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
MHC alloantigen is recognized by two pathways: “directly,” intact on donor cells, or “indirectly,” as self-restricted allopeptide. The duration of each pathway, and its relative contribution to allograft vasculopathy, remain unclear. Using a murine model of chronic allograft rejection, we report that direct-pathway CD4 T cell alloresponses, as well as indirect-pathway responses against MHC class II alloantigen, are curtailed by rapid elimination of donor hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, persistent presentation of epitope resulted in continual division and less-profound contraction of the class I allopeptide-specific CD4 T cell population, with approximately 10,000-fold more cells persisting than following acute allograft rejection. This expanded population nevertheless displayed sub-optimal anamnestic responses and was unable to provide co-stimulation-independent help for generating alloantibody. Indirect-pathway CD4 T cell responses are heterogeneous. Appreciation that responses against particular alloantigens dominate at late time points will likely inform development of strategies aimed at improving transplant outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase checkpoint pathway maintains genome integrity; however, the role of the sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) acetylome in regulating this pathway is not clear. We found that deacetylation of ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP), a regulatory partner of ATR, by SIRT2 potentiates the ATR checkpoint. SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates ATRIP at lysine 32 (K32) in response to replication stress. SIRT2 deacetylation of ATRIP at K32 drives ATR autophosphorylation and signaling and facilitates DNA replication fork progression and recovery of stalled replication forks. K32 deacetylation by SIRT2 further promotes ATRIP accumulation to DNA damage sites and binding to replication protein A-coated single-stranded DNA (RPA-ssDNA). Collectively, these results support a model in which ATRIP deacetylation by SIRT2 promotes ATR-ATRIP binding to RPA-ssDNA to drive ATR activation and thus facilitate recovery from replication stress, outlining a mechanism by which the ATR checkpoint is regulated by SIRT2 through deacetylation.

Abstract: Summary
Monoamine and acetylcholine neurotransmitters from the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. The molecular mechanisms controlling neurotransmitter signaling in islet β cells and their impact on diabetes development are only partially understood. Using a glucose-intolerant, MafA-deficient mouse model, we demonstrate that MAFA controls ANS-mediated insulin secretion by activating the transcription of nicotinic (ChrnB2 and ChrnB4) and adrenergic (Adra2A) receptor genes, which are integral parts of acetylcholine- and monoamine-signaling pathways. We show that acetylcholine-mediated insulin secretion requires nicotinic signaling and that nicotinic receptor expression is positively correlated with insulin secretion and glycemic control in human donor islets. Moreover, polymorphisms spanning MAFA-binding regions within the human CHRNB4 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes. Our data show that MAFA transcriptional activity is required for establishing β cell sensitivity to neurotransmitter signaling and identify nicotinic signaling as a modulator of insulin secretion impaired in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotics, though remarkably useful, can also cause certain adverse effects. We detected that treatment of adult mice with antibiotics decreases hippocampal neurogenesis and memory retention. Reconstitution with normal gut flora (SPF) did not completely reverse the deficits in neurogenesis unless the mice also had access to a running wheel or received probiotics. In parallel to an increase in neurogenesis and memory retention, both SPF-reconstituted mice that ran and mice supplemented with probiotics exhibited higher numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes in the brain than antibiotic-treated mice. Elimination of Ly6Chi monocytes by antibody depletion or the use of knockout mice resulted in decreased neurogenesis, whereas adoptive transfer of Ly6Chi monocytes rescued neurogenesis after antibiotic treatment. We propose that the rescue of neurogenesis and behavior deficits in antibiotic-treated mice by exercise and probiotics is partially mediated by Ly6Chi monocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumor initiation has significant impact on early cancer detection and intervention. To define the role of KLF4 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) initiation, we used molecular biological analyses and mouse models of klf4 gain- and loss-of-function and mutant Kras. KLF4 is upregulated in and required for acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Klf4 ablation drastically attenuates the formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia induced by mutant KrasG12D, whereas upregulation of KLF4 does the opposite. Mutant KRAS and cellular injuries induce KLF4 expression, and ectopic expression of KLF4 in acinar cells reduces acinar lineage- and induces ductal lineage-related marker expression. These results demonstrate that KLF4 induces ductal identity in PanIN initiation and may be a potential target for prevention of PDA initiation.

Abstract: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (elF2α), which is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, functions in cell death and survival under various stress conditions. ln this study, we investigated the roles of elF2α phosphorylation in cell death using the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR. MCF- 7/ADR cells are MCF-7-driven cells that have acquired resistance to doxorubicin (ADR). Treatment of doxorubicin reduced the viability and induced apoptosis in both cell lines, although susceptibility to the drug was very different. Treatment with doxorubicin induced phosphorylation of elF2α in MCF-7 cells but not in MCF-7/ADR cells. Basal expression levels of Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 34 (GADD34), a regulator of elF2α, were higher in MCF-7/ADR cells compared to MCF-7 cells. lndeed, treatment with sa- lubrinal, an inhibitor of GADD34, resulted in the upregulation of elF2α phosphorylation and enhanced doxorubicin- mediated apoptosis in MCF-7/ADR cells. However, MCF-7 cells did not show such synergic effects. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of elF2α by GADD34 plays an important role in doxorubicin resistance in MCF-7/ADR cells.

Abstract: In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), deficiency of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin leads to well-described defects in skeletal muscle but also to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In cardiac cells, the subsarcolemmal localization of dystrophin is thought to protect the membrane from mechanical stress. The dystrophin deficiency leads to membrane instability and a high stress-induced Ca2+ influx due to dysregulation of sarcolemmal channels such as stretch-activated channels (SACs). In this work divalent cation entry has been explored in isolated ventricular Wild Type (WT) and mdx cardiomyocytes in two different conditions: at rest and during the application of an axial stretch. At rest, our results suggest that activation of TRPV2 channels participates to a constitutive basal cation entry in mdx cardiomyocytes.Using microcarbon fibres technique, an axial stretchwas applied to mimic effects of physiological conditions of ventricular filling and study on cation influx bythe Mn2+-quenching techniquedemonstrated a high stretch-dependentcationic influx in dystrophic cells, partially due to SACs. Involvement of TRPs channels in this excessive Ca2+ influx has been investigated using specific modulators and demonstratedboth sarcolemmal localization and an abnormal activity of TRPV2 channels. In conclusion, TRPV2 channels are demonstrated here to play a key role in cation influx and dysregulation in dystrophin deficient cardiomyocytes, enhanced in stretching conditions.

Abstract: Summary
FGF21 decreases plasma triglycerides (TGs) in rodents and humans; however, the underlying mechanism or mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we examined the role of FGF21 in production and disposal of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in mice. Treatment with pharmacological doses of FGF21 acutely reduced plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), liver TG content, and VLDL-TG secretion. In addition, metabolic turnover studies revealed that FGF21 facilitated the catabolism of TRL in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). FGF21-dependent TRL processing was strongly attenuated in CD36-deficient mice and transgenic mice lacking lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissues. Insulin resistance in diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice shifted FGF21 responses from WAT toward energy-combusting BAT. In conclusion, FGF21 lowers plasma TGs through a dual mechanism: first, by reducing NEFA plasma levels and consequently hepatic VLDL lipidation and, second, by increasing CD36 and LPL-dependent TRL disposal in WAT and BAT.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental principle governing organ size and function is the fine balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Here, we identify RONIN (THAP11) as a key transcriptional regulator of retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferation. RPC-specific loss of Ronin results in a phenotype strikingly similar to that resulting from the G1- to S-phase arrest and photoreceptor degeneration observed in the Cyclin D1 null mutants. However, we determined that, rather than regulating canonical cell-cycle genes, RONIN regulates a cohort of mitochondrial genes including components of the electron transport chain (ETC), which have been recently implicated as direct regulators of the cell cycle. Coincidentally, with premature cell-cycle exit, Ronin mutants exhibited deficient ETC activity, reduced ATP levels, and increased oxidative stress that we ascribe to specific loss of subunits within complexes I, III, and IV. These data implicate RONIN as a positive regulator of mitochondrial gene expression that coordinates mitochondrial activity and cell-cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
We report that p73 is expressed in multiciliated cells (MCCs), is required for MCC differentiation, and directly regulates transcriptional modulators of multiciliogenesis. Loss of ciliary biogenesis provides a unifying mechanism for many phenotypes observed in p73 knockout mice including hydrocephalus; hippocampal dysgenesis; sterility; and chronic inflammation/infection of lung, middle ear, and sinus. Through p73 and p63 ChIP-seq using murine tracheal cells, we identified over 100 putative p73 target genes that regulate MCC differentiation and homeostasis. We validated Foxj1, a transcriptional regulator of multiciliogenesis, and many other cilia-associated genes as direct target genes of p73 and p63. We show p73 and p63 are co-expressed in a subset of basal cells and suggest that p73 marks these cells for MCC differentiation. In summary, p73 is essential for MCC differentiation, functions as a critical regulator of a transcriptome required for MCC differentiation, and, like p63, has an essential role in development of tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation of organisms to ever-changing nutritional environments relies on sensor tissues and systemic signals. Identification of these signals would help understand the physiological crosstalk between organs contributing to growth and metabolic homeostasis. Here we show that Eiger, the Drosophila TNF-α, is a metabolic hormone that mediates nutrient response by remotely acting on insulin-producing cells (IPCs). In the condition of nutrient shortage, a metalloprotease of the TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) family is active in fat body (adipose-like) cells, allowing the cleavage and release of adipose Eiger in the hemolymph. In the brain IPCs, Eiger activates its receptor Grindelwald, leading to JNK-dependent inhibition of insulin production. Therefore, we have identified a humoral connexion between the fat body and the brain insulin-producing cells relying on TNF-α that mediates adaptive response to nutrient deprivation.

Abstract: Summary
Allergic reactions can in severe cases induce a state of circulatory shock referred to as anaphylaxis. Histamine, the primary mediator of this condition, is released from immune cells, and, therefore, anaphylaxis has so far been considered an immune system disorder. However, we here show that the glutamatergic receptor mGluR7, expressed on a subpopulation of both peripheral and spinal cord neurons, controls histamine-induced communication through calcium-dependent autoinhibition with implications for anaphylaxis. Genetic ablation of mGluR7, and thus altered regulation of histamine-sensing neurons, caused an anaphylaxis-like state in mGluR7−/− mice, which could be reversed by antagonizing signaling between neurons and mast cells but not by antagonizing a central itch pathway. Our findings demonstrate the vital role of nervous system control by mGluR7 in anaphylaxis and open up possibilities for preventive strategies for this life-threatening condition.

Abstract: Summary
Small, noncoding RNA biogenesis typically involves cleavage of structured precursor by RNase III-like endonucleases. However, guide RNAs (gRNAs) that direct U-insertion/deletion mRNA editing in mitochondria of trypanosomes maintain 5′ triphosphate characteristic of the transcription initiation and possess a U-tail indicative of 3′ processing and uridylation. Here, we identified a protein complex composed of RET1 TUTase, DSS1 3′-5′ exonuclease, and three additional subunits. This complex, termed mitochondrial 3′ processome (MPsome), is responsible for primary uridylation of ∼800 nt gRNA precursors, their processive degradation to a mature size of 40–60 nt, and secondary U-tail addition. Both strands of the gRNA gene are transcribed into sense and antisense precursors of similar lengths. Head-to-head hybridization of these transcripts blocks symmetrical 3′-5′ degradation at a fixed distance from the double-stranded region. Together, our findings suggest a model in which gRNA is derived from the 5′ extremity of a primary molecule by uridylation-induced, antisense transcription-controlled 3′-5′ exonucleolytic degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Cells store membrane in surface reservoirs of pits and protrusions. These membrane reservoirs facilitate cell shape change and buffer mechanical stress, but we do not know how reservoir dynamics are regulated. During cellularization, the first cytokinesis in Drosophila embryos, a reservoir of microvilli unfolds to fuel cleavage furrow ingression. We find that regulated exocytosis adds membrane to the reservoir before and during unfolding. Dynamic F-actin deforms exocytosed membrane into microvilli. Single microvilli extend and retract in ∼20 s, while the overall reservoir is depleted in sync with furrow ingression over 60–70 min. Using pharmacological and genetic perturbations, we show that exocytosis promotes microvillar F-actin assembly, while furrow ingression controls microvillar F-actin disassembly. Thus, reservoir F-actin and, consequently, reservoir dynamics are regulated by membrane supply from exocytosis and membrane demand from furrow ingression.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I and MDA5 sense virus-derived short 5′ppp blunt-ended or long dsRNA, respectively, causing interferon production. Non-signaling LGP2 appears to positively and negatively regulate MDA5 and RIG-I signaling, respectively. Co-crystal structures of chicken (ch) LGP2 with dsRNA display a fully or semi-closed conformation depending on the presence or absence of nucleotide. LGP2 caps blunt, 3′ or 5′ overhang dsRNA ends with 1 bp longer overall footprint than RIG-I. Structures of 1:1 and 2:1 complexes of chMDA5 with short dsRNA reveal head-to-head packing rather than the polar head-to-tail orientation described for long filaments. chLGP2 and chMDA5 make filaments with a similar axial repeat, although less co-operatively for chLGP2. Overall, LGP2 resembles a chimera combining a MDA5-like helicase domain and RIG-I like CTD supporting both stem and end binding. Functionally, RNA binding is required for LGP2-mediated enhancement of MDA5 activation. We propose that LGP2 end-binding may promote nucleation of MDA5 oligomerization on dsRNA.

Abstract: Abiotic stresses such as drought and low temperature critically restrict plant growth, reproduction, and productivity. Higher plants have developed various defense strat egies against these unfavorable conditions. CaPUB1 (Capsicum annuum Putative U-box protein 1) is a hot pep per U-box E3 Ub ligase. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed CaPUB1 exhibited drought sensitive phenotypes, suggesting that it functions as a negative regulator of the drought stress response. In this study, CaPUB1 was over-expressed in rice (Oryza sativa L.), and the phenotypic properties of transgenic rice plants were examined in terms of their drought and cold stress tolerance. Ubi:CaPUB1 T3 transgenic rice plants displayed phenotypes hypersensitive to dehydration, suggesting that its role in the negative regulation of drought stress response is conserved in dicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice plants. In contrast, Ubi:CaPUB1 progeny exhibited phenotypes markedly tolerant to prolonged low tempera ture (4°C) treatment, compared to those of wild-type plants, as determined by survival rates, electrolyte leakage, and total chlorophyll content. Cold stress-induced marker genes, including DREB1A, DREB1B, DREB1C, and Cyto chrome P450, were more up-regulated by cold treatment in Ubi:CaPUB1 plants than in wild-type plants. These results suggest that CaPUB1 serves as both a negative regulator of the drought stress response and a positive regulator of the cold stress response in transgenic rice plants. This raises the possibility that CaPUB1 participates in the cross-talk between drought and low-temperature signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The T cell receptor (TCR) controls the cellular adaptive immune response to antigens, but our understanding of TCR repertoire diversity and response to challenge is still incomplete. For example, TCR clones shared by different individuals with minimal alteration to germline gene sequences (public clones) are detectable in all vertebrates, but their significance is unknown. Although small in size, the zebrafish TCR repertoire is controlled by processes similar to those operating in mammals. Thus, we studied the zebrafish TCR repertoire and its response to stimulation with self and foreign antigens. We found that cross-reactive public TCRs dominate the T cell response, endowing a limited TCR repertoire with the ability to cope with diverse antigenic challenges. These features of vertebrate public TCRs might provide a mechanism for the rapid generation of protective T cell immunity, allowing a short temporal window for the development of more specific private T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
Axonal degeneration is a characteristic feature of neurodegenerative disease and nerve injury. Here, we characterize axonal degeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons following laser-induced axotomy. We show that this process proceeds independently of the WLDS and Nmnat pathway and requires the axonal clearance machinery that includes the conserved transmembrane receptor CED-1/Draper, the adaptor protein CED-6, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 (CED-2/CED-5/CED-12), and the small GTPase Rac1 (CED-10). We demonstrate that CED-1 and CED-6 function non-cell autonomously in the surrounding hypodermis, which we show acts as the engulfing tissue for the severed axon. Moreover, we establish a function in this process for CED-7, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and NRF-5, a lipid-binding protein, both associated with release of lipid-vesicles during apoptotic cell clearance. Thus, our results reveal the existence of a WLDS/Nmnat-independent axonal degeneration pathway, conservation of the axonal clearance machinery, and a function for CED-7 and NRF-5 in this process.

Abstract: Summary
How MYC promotes the development of cancer remains to be fully understood. Here, we report that the Zn2+-finger transcription factor ASCIZ (ATMIN, ZNF822) synergizes with MYC to activate the expression of dynein light chain (DYNLL1, LC8) in the murine Eμ-Myc model of lymphoma. Deletion of Asciz or Dynll1 prevented the abnormal expansion of pre-B cells in pre-cancerous Eμ-Myc mice and potentiated the pro-apoptotic activity of MYC in pre-leukemic immature B cells. Constitutive loss of Asciz or Dynll1 delayed lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc mice, and induced deletion of Asciz in established lymphomas extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice. We propose that ASCIZ-dependent upregulation of DYNLL1 levels is essential for the development and expansion of MYC-driven lymphomas by enabling the survival of pre-neoplastic and malignant cells.

Abstract: Summary
Information about translations and rotations of the body is critical for complex self-motion perception during spatial navigation. However, little is known about the nature and function of their convergence in the cortex. We measured neural activity in multiple areas in the macaque parietal cortex in response to three different types of body motion applied through a motion platform: translation, rotation, and combined stimuli, i.e., curvilinear motion. We found a continuous representation of motion types in each area. In contrast to single-modality cells preferring either translation-only or rotation-only stimuli, convergent cells tend to be optimally tuned to curvilinear motion. A weighted summation model captured the data well, suggesting that translation and rotation signals are integrated subadditively in the cortex. Interestingly, variation in the activity of convergent cells parallels behavioral outputs reported in human psychophysical experiments. We conclude that representation of curvilinear self-motion perception is widely distributed in the primate sensory cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of circadian rhythms is associated with metabolic dysfunction, yet it is unclear whether enhancing clock function can ameliorate metabolic disorders. In an unbiased chemical screen using fibroblasts expressing PER2::Luc, we identified Nobiletin (NOB), a natural polymethoxylated flavone, as a clock amplitude-enhancing small molecule. When administered to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, NOB strongly counteracted metabolic syndrome and augmented energy expenditure and locomotor activity in a Clock gene-dependent manner. In db/db mutant mice, the clock is also required for the mitigating effects of NOB on metabolic disorders. In DIO mouse liver, NOB enhanced clock protein levels and elicited pronounced gene expression remodeling. We identified retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptors as direct targets of NOB, revealing a pharmacological intervention that enhances circadian rhythms to combat metabolic disease via the circadian gene network.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic rejection of solid organ allografts remains the major cause of transplant failure. Donor-derived tissue-resident lymphocytes are transferred to the recipient during transplantation, but their impact on alloimmunity is unknown. Using mouse cardiac transplant models, we show that graft-versus-host recognition by passenger donor CD4 T cells markedly augments recipient cellular and humoral alloimmunity, resulting in more severe allograft vasculopathy and early graft failure. This augmentation is enhanced when donors were pre-sensitized to the recipient, is dependent upon avoidance of host NK cell recognition, and is partly due to provision of cognate help for allo-specific B cells from donor CD4 T cells recognizing B cell MHC class II in a peptide-degenerate manner. Passenger donor lymphocytes may therefore influence recipient alloimmune responses and represent a therapeutic target in solid organ transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
The immune response plays a key role in enhancing the therapeutic activity of oncolytic virotherapies. However, to date, investigators have relied on inherent interactions between the virus and the immune system, often coupled to the expression of a single cytokine transgene. Recently, the importance of TLR activation in mediating adaptive immunity has been demonstrated. We therefore sought to influence the type and level of immune response raised after oncolytic vaccinia therapy through manipulation of TLR signaling. Vaccinia naturally activates TLR2, associated with an antibody response, whereas a CTL response is associated with TLR3-TRIF-signaling pathways. We manipulated TLR signaling by vaccinia through deglycosylation of the viral particle to block TLR2 activation and expression of a TRIF transgene. The resulting vector displayed greatly reduced production of anti-viral neutralizing antibody as well as an increased anti-tumor CTL response. Delivery in both naive and pre-treated mice was enhanced and immunotherapeutic activity dramatically improved.

Abstract: Summary
Correct function of the mitotic spindle requires balanced interplay of kinetochore and astral microtubules that mediate chromosome segregation and spindle positioning, respectively. Errors therein can cause severe defects ranging from aneuploidy to developmental disorders. Here, we describe a protein degradation pathway that functionally links astral microtubules to kinetochores via regulation of a microtubule-associated factor. We show that the yeast spindle positioning protein Kar9 localizes not only to astral but also to kinetochore microtubules, where it becomes targeted for proteasomal degradation by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) Slx5-Slx8. Intriguingly, this process does not depend on preceding sumoylation of Kar9 but rather requires SUMO-dependent recruitment of STUbLs to kinetochores. Failure to degrade Kar9 leads to defects in both chromosome segregation and spindle positioning. We propose that kinetochores serve as platforms to recruit STUbLs in a SUMO-dependent manner in order to ensure correct spindle function by regulating levels of microtubule-associated proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbation in the transcriptional control of genes driving differentiation is an established paradigm whereby oncogenic fusion proteins promote leukemia. From a retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line, we derived an RA-resistant clone characterized by a block in transcription initiation, despite maintaining wild-type PML/RARA expression. We uncovered an aberrant interaction among PML/RARA, nucleophosmin (NPM), and topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B). Surprisingly, RA stimulation in these cells results in enhanced chromatin association of the nucleosome remodeler BRG1. Inhibition of NPM or TOP2B abrogated BRG1 recruitment. Furthermore, NPM inhibition and targeting BRG1 restored differentiation when combined with RA. Here, we demonstrate a role for NPM and BRG1 in obstructing RA differentiation and implicate chromatin remodeling in mediating therapeutic resistance in malignancies. NPM mutations are the most common genetic change in patients with acute leukemia (AML); therefore, our model may be applicable to other more common leukemias driven by NPM.

Abstract: Summary
In contrast to mammals, zebrafish regenerate heart injuries via proliferation of cardiomyocytes located near the wound border. To identify regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, we used spatially resolved RNA sequencing (tomo-seq) and generated a high-resolution genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the regenerating zebrafish heart. Interestingly, we identified two wound border zones with distinct expression profiles, including the re-expression of embryonic cardiac genes and targets of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Endogenous BMP signaling has been reported to be detrimental to mammalian cardiac repair. In contrast, we find that genetic or chemical inhibition of BMP signaling in zebrafish reduces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation, ultimately compromising myocardial regeneration, while bmp2b overexpression is sufficient to enhance it. Our results provide a resource for further studies on the molecular regulation of cardiac regeneration and reveal intriguing differential cellular responses of cardiomyocytes to a conserved signaling pathway in regenerative versus non-regenerative hearts.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Gcr1 controls expression of over 75% of the genes in actively growing yeast. Yet despite its widespread effects, regulation of Gcr1 itself remains poorly understood. Here, we show that posttranscriptional Gcr1 regulation is nutrient dependent. Moreover, GCR1 RNA contains a long, highly conserved intron, which allows the cell to generate multiple RNA and protein isoforms whose levels change upon glucose depletion. Intriguingly, an isoform generated by intron retention is exported from the nucleus, and its translation is initiated from a conserved, intronic translation start site. Expression of gene products from both the spliced and unspliced RNAs is essential, as cells expressing only one isoform cannot adjust their metabolic program in response to environmental changes. Finally, we show that the Gcr1 proteins form dimers, providing an elegant mechanism by which this one gene, through its regulation, can perform the repertoire of transcriptional activities necessary for fine-tuned environmental response.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown of enzymes are not equivalent in cells, but network-level mechanisms that cause discrepancies between knockdown and inhibitor perturbations are not understood. Here we report that enzymes regulated by negative feedback are robust to knockdown but susceptible to inhibition. Using the Raf–MEK–ERK kinase cascade as a model system, we find that ERK activation is resistant to genetic knockdown of MEK but susceptible to a comparable degree of chemical MEK inhibition. We demonstrate that negative feedback from ERK to Raf causes this knockdown-versus-inhibitor discrepancy in vivo. Exhaustive mathematical modeling of three-tiered enzyme cascades suggests that this result is general: negative autoregulation or feedback favors inhibitor potency, whereas positive autoregulation or feedback favors knockdown potency. Our findings provide a rationale for selecting pharmacologic versus genetic perturbations in vivo and point out the dangers of using knockdown approaches in search of drug targets.

Abstract: Summary
Accurately translating genotype to phenotype requires accounting for the functional impact of genetic variation at many biological scales. Here, we present a strategy for genotype-phenotype reasoning based on existing knowledge of cellular subsystems. These subsystems and their hierarchical organization are defined by the Gene Ontology or a complementary ontology inferred directly from previously published datasets. Guided by the ontology’s hierarchical structure, we organize genotype data into an “ontotype,” that is, a hierarchy of perturbations representing the effects of genetic variation at multiple cellular scales. The ontotype is then interpreted using logical rules generated by machine learning to predict phenotype. This approach substantially outperforms previous non-hierarchical methods for translating yeast genotype to cell growth phenotype, and it accurately predicts the growth outcomes of two new screens of 2,503 double gene knockouts affecting DNA repair or nuclear lumen. Ontotypes also generalize to larger knockout combinations, setting the stage for interpreting the complex genetics of disease.

Abstract: Caffeine has both positive and negative effects on physiological functions in a dose-dependent manner. C. elegans has been used as an animal model to investigate the effects of caffeine on development. Caffeine treatment at a high dose (30 mM) showed detrimental effects and caused early larval arrest. We performed a comparative proteomic analysis to investigate the mode of action of high-dose caffeine treatment in C. elegans and found that the stress response proteins, heat shock protein (HSP)-4 (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] chaperone), HSP-6 (mitochondrial chaperone), and HSP-16 (cytosolic chaperone), were induced and their expression was regulated at the transcriptional level. These findings suggest that high-dose caffeine intake causes a strong stress response and activates all three stress-response pathways in the worms, including the ER-, mitochondrial-, and cytosolic pathways. RNA interference of each hsp gene or in triple combination retarded growth. In addition, caffeine treatment stimulated a food-avoidance behavior (aversion phenotype), which was enhanced by RNAi depletion of the hsp-4 gene. Therefore, up-regulation of hsp genes after caffeine treatment appeared to be the major responses to alleviate stress and protect against developmental arrest.

Abstract: Summary
We present the Real-time Accurate Cell-shape Extractor (RACE), a high-throughput image analysis framework for automated three-dimensional cell segmentation in large-scale images. RACE is 55–330 times faster and 2–5 times more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the generality of RACE by extracting cell-shape information from entire Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos imaged with confocal and light-sheet microscopes. Using RACE, we automatically reconstructed cellular-resolution tissue anisotropy maps across developing Drosophila embryos and quantified differences in cell-shape dynamics in wild-type and mutant embryos. We furthermore integrated RACE with our framework for automated cell lineaging and performed joint segmentation and cell tracking in entire Drosophila embryos. RACE processed these terabyte-sized datasets on a single computer within 1.4 days. RACE is easy to use, as it requires adjustment of only three parameters, takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multi-core processors and graphics cards, and is available as open-source software for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

Abstract: Summary
Motor-cargo recruitment to microtubules is often the rate-limiting step of intracellular transport, and defects in this recruitment can cause neurodegenerative disease. Here, we use in vitro reconstitution assays with single-molecule resolution, live-cell transport assays in primary neurons, computational image analysis, and computer simulations to investigate the factors regulating retrograde transport initiation in the distal axon. We find that phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal-organelle linker protein CLIP-170 and post-translational modifications of the microtubule track combine to precisely control the initiation of retrograde transport. Computer simulations of organelle dynamics in the distal axon indicate that while CLIP-170 primarily regulates the time to microtubule encounter, the tyrosination state of the microtubule lattice regulates the likelihood of binding. These mechanisms interact to control transport initiation in the axon in a manner sensitive to the specialized cytoskeletal architecture of the neuron.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostasis of short-lived blood cells is dependent on rapid proliferation of immature precursors. Using a conditional histone 2B-mCherry-labeling mouse model, we characterize hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor proliferation dynamics in steady state and following several types of induced stress. HSC proliferation following HSC transplantation into lethally irradiated mice is fundamentally different not only from native hematopoiesis but also from other stress contexts. Whereas transplantation promoted sustained, long-term proliferation of HSCs, both cytokine-induced mobilization and acute depletion of selected blood cell lineages elicited very limited recruitment of HSCs to the proliferative pool. By coupling mCherry-based analysis of proliferation history with multiplex gene expression analyses on single cells, we have found that HSCs can be stratified into four distinct subtypes. These subtypes have distinct molecular signatures and differ significantly in their reconstitution potentials, showcasing the power of tracking proliferation history when resolving functional heterogeneity of HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal function is highly sensitive to changes in oxygen levels, but how hypoxia affects dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis is unknown. Here we report that hypoxia, chemical inhibition of the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs), and silencing of Phd2 induce immature filopodium-like dendritic protrusions, promote spine regression, reduce synaptic density, and decrease the frequency of spontaneous action potentials independently of HIF signaling. We identified the actin cross-linker filamin A (FLNA) as a target of PHD2 mediating these effects. In normoxia, PHD2 hydroxylates the proline residues P2309 and P2316 in FLNA, leading to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia, PHD2 inactivation rapidly upregulates FLNA protein levels because of blockage of its proteasomal degradation. FLNA upregulation induces more immature spines, whereas Flna silencing rescues the immature spine phenotype induced by PHD2 inhibition.

Abstract: Paneth cells are secretory epithelial cells of the innate immune system of the intestine of several mammals, including alpacas. Little is known about the latter; thus, in the present study we described the morphology and histochemical characteristics of Paneth cells in healthy fetuses, and young and adult alpacas. For this purpose, samples of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken from 6 fetuses at different days of pregnancy (between days 221–330), 66 offsprings (between 0 and 45-days-old) and 5 adult alpacas (>2-years-old). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histological and morphometrical analysis using HE and Masson Trichomićs technique. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify Paneth cells using anti-lysozyme antibody. In addition, the lectinhistochemichal binding-pattern of Paneth celĺs granules was evaluated. Lyzozyme was immunohistochemically detected in the granules of Paneth cells from day 283 of pregnancy in all the small intestinal sections of the studied fetuses. In newborn alpacas Paneth cells were initially found in the duodenum, but the following days (days 18–21 after birth) they were also found in the ileum. Their size gradually increased after birth, but then no significant differences were found. In adult alpacas the number was lower than offsprings. We suggest that Paneth cells early differentiate in the small intestine of alpacas, and the increase in their number during the first two weeks of life strongly support their possible involvement in the intestinal defensive functions against the enteric diseases that occur during the lactancy stage.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus thermophilus (St) type III-A CRISPR-Cas system restricts MS2 RNA phage and cuts RNA in vitro. However, the CRISPR array spacers match DNA phages, raising the question: does the St CRISPR-Cas system provide immunity by erasing phage mRNA or/and by eliminating invading DNA? We show that it does both. We find that (1) base-pairing between crRNA and target RNA activates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) degradation by StCsm; (2) ssDNase activity is confined to the HD-domain of Cas10; (3) target RNA cleavage by the Csm3 RNase suppresses Cas10 DNase activity, ensuring temporal control of DNA degradation; and (4) base-pairing between crRNA 5′-handle and target RNA 3′-flanking sequence inhibits Cas10 ssDNase to prevent self-targeting. We propose that upon phage infection, crRNA-guided StCsm binding to the emerging transcript recruits Cas10 DNase to the actively transcribed phage DNA, resulting in degradation of both the transcript and phage DNA, but not the host DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Fewer than half of children with high-risk neuroblastoma survive. Many of these tumors harbor high-level amplification of MYCN, which correlates with poor disease outcome. Using data from our large drug screen we predicted, and subsequently demonstrated, that MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas are sensitive to the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199. This sensitivity occurs in part through low anti-apoptotic BCL-xL expression, high pro-apoptotic NOXA expression, and paradoxical, MYCN-driven upregulation of NOXA. Screening for enhancers of ABT-199 sensitivity in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, we demonstrate that the Aurora Kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 combines with ABT-199 to induce widespread apoptosis. In diverse models of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, including a patient-derived xenograft model, this combination uniformly induced tumor shrinkage, and in multiple instances led to complete tumor regression.

Abstract: Summary
Here we provide evidence that RBBP4 modulates temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity through coordinate regulation of two key DNA repair genes critical for recovery from TMZ-induced DNA damage: methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and RAD51. Disruption of RBBP4 enhanced TMZ sensitivity, induced synthetic lethality to PARP inhibition, and increased DNA damage signaling in response to TMZ. Moreover, RBBP4 silencing enhanced TMZ-induced H2AX phosphorylation and apoptosis in GBM cells. Intriguingly, RBBP4 knockdown suppressed the expression of MGMT, RAD51, and other genes in association with decreased promoter H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and increased H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3). Consistent with these data, RBBP4 interacts with CBP/p300 to form a chromatin-modifying complex that binds within the promoter of MGMT, RAD51, and perhaps other genes. Globally, RBBP4 positively and negatively regulates genes involved in critical cellular functions including tumorigenesis. The RBBP4/CBP/p300 complex may provide an interesting target for developing therapy-sensitizing strategies for GBM and other tumors.

Abstract: Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is an important event in LN. Our previous studies have shown that extracellular High Mobility Group Box-1 protein (HMGB1) plays a critical role in pathophysiological mechanism of lupus nephritis (LN) and HMGB1 could induce MC proliferation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal pathway activation on mesangial cell proliferation induced by HMGB1 and whether Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important role in this progress. The results showed that HMGB1 induced overexpression of p85, p110 and p-Akt in mouse mesangial cell (MMC) and increased the proliferative level of MMC cells. In addition, HMGB1 induced a physical interaction between TLR2 and p85. The TLR2 neutralization antibody and LY294002 both reduced the MMC proliferation levels induced by HMGB1 and also blocked the HMGB1-dependent phosphorylation of the Akt. Thus, HMGB1 increases interaction between TLR2 with p85 and in sequence phosphorylates Akt at ser473, thereafter mediates MMC proliferation, which contributed significantly to the pathophysiology of MMCs dysfunction.

Genes Frequently Coexpressed with Hoxc8 Provide Insight into the Discovery of Target Genes,

Abstract: Identifying Hoxc8 target genes is at the crux of understanding the Hoxc8-mediated regulatory networks underlying its roles during development. However, identification of these genes remains difficult due to intrinsic factors of Hoxc8, such as low DNA binding specificity, context-dependent regulation, and unknown cofactors. Therefore, as an alternative, the present study attempted to test whether the roles of Hoxc8 could be inferred by simply analyzing genes frequently coexpressed with Hoxc8, and whether these genes include putative target genes. Using archived gene expression datasets in which Hoxc8 was differentially expressed, we identified a total of 567 genes that were positively coexpressed with Hoxc8 in at least four out of eight datasets. Among these, 23 genes were coexpressed in six datasets. Gene sets associated with extracellular matrix and cell adhesion were most significantly enriched, followed by gene sets for skeletal system development, morphogenesis, cell motility, and transcriptional regulation. In particular, transcriptional regulators, including paralogs of Hoxc8, known Hox co-factors, and transcriptional remodeling factors were enriched. We randomly selected Adam19, Ptpn13, Prkd1, Tgfbi, and Aldh1a3, and validated their coexpression in mouse embryonic tissues and cell lines following TGF-β2 treatment or ectopic Hoxc8 expression. Except for Aldh1a3, all genes showed concordant expression with that of Hoxc8, suggesting that the coexpressed genes might include direct or indirect target genes. Collectively, we suggest that the coexpressed genes provide a resource for constructing Hoxc8-mediated regulatory networks.

Abstract: Summary
Atherosclerosis is initiated and sustained by hypercholesterolemia, which results in the generation of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) and other metabolic byproducts that trigger inflammation. Specific immune responses have been shown to modulate the inflammatory response during atherogenesis. The sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin G (Siglec-G) is a negative regulator of the functions of several immune cells, including myeloid cells and B-1 cells. Here, we show that deficiency of Siglec-G in atherosclerosis-prone mice inhibits plaque formation and diet-induced hepatic inflammation. We further demonstrate that selective deficiency of Siglec-G in B cells alone is sufficient to mediate these effects. Levels of B-1 cell-derived natural IgM with specificity for OxLDL were significantly increased in the plasma and peritoneal cavity of Siglec-G-deficient mice. Consistent with the neutralizing functions of OxLDL-specific IgM, Siglec-G-deficient mice were protected from OxLDL-induced sterile inflammation. Thus, Siglec-G promotes atherosclerosis and hepatic inflammation by suppressing protective anti-inflammatory effector functions of B cells.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary restriction (DR) is the most powerful natural means to extend lifespan. Although several genes can mediate responses to alternate DR regimens, no single genetic intervention has recapitulated the full effects of DR, and no unified system is known for different DR regimens. Here we obtain temporally resolved transcriptomes during calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in Caenorhabditis elegans and find that early and late responses involve metabolism and cell cycle/DNA damage, respectively. We uncover three network modules of DR regulators by their target specificity. By genetic manipulations of nodes representing discrete modules, we induce transcriptomes that progressively resemble DR as multiple nodes are perturbed. Targeting all three nodes simultaneously results in extremely long-lived animals that are refractory to DR. These results and dynamic simulations demonstrate that extensive feedback controls among regulators may be leveraged to drive the regulatory circuitry to a younger steady state, recapitulating the full effect of DR.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are uniquely dependent on aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP. However, the importance of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has not been elucidated. Detailed amino acid profiling has revealed that glutamine is indispensable for the survival of hPSCs. Under glucose- and glutamine-depleted conditions, hPSCs quickly died due to the loss of ATP. Metabolome analyses showed that hPSCs oxidized pyruvate poorly and that glutamine was the main energy source for OXPHOS. hPSCs were unable to utilize pyruvate-derived citrate due to negligible expression of aconitase 2 (ACO2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3 (IDH2/3) and high expression of ATP-citrate lyase. Cardiomyocytes with mature mitochondria were not able to survive without glucose and glutamine, although they were able to use lactate to synthesize pyruvate and glutamate. This distinguishing feature of hPSC metabolism allows preparation of clinical-grade cell sources free of undifferentiated hPSCs, which prevents tumor formation during stem cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration is fundamental for life and a hallmark of cancer. Neural crest (NC) cells migrate collectively, but the mechanisms governing this process remain controversial. Previous analyses in Xenopus indicate that cranial NC (CNC) cells are a homogeneous population relying on cell-cell interactions for directional migration, while chick embryo analyses suggest a heterogeneous population with leader cells instructing directionality. Our data in chick and zebrafish embryos show that CNC cells do not require leader cells for migration and all cells present similar migratory capacities. In contrast, laser ablation of trunk NC (TNC) cells shows that leader cells direct movement and cell-cell contacts are required for migration. Moreover, leader and follower identities are acquired before the initiation of migration and remain fixed thereafter. Thus, two distinct mechanisms establish the directionality of CNC cells and TNC cells. This implies the existence of multiple molecular mechanisms for collective cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Super-resolution microscopy has revealed that immune cell receptors are organized in nanoscale clusters at cell surfaces and immune synapses. However, mechanisms and functions for this nanoscale organization remain unclear. Here, we used super-resolution microscopy to compare the surface organization of paired killer Ig-like receptors (KIR), KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS1, on human primary natural killer cells and cell lines. Activating KIR2DS1 assembled in clusters two-fold larger than its inhibitory counterpart KIR2DL1. Site-directed mutagenesis established that the size of nanoclusters is controlled by transmembrane amino acid 233, a lysine in KIR2DS1. Super-resolution microscopy also revealed two ways in which the nanoscale clustering of KIR affects signaling. First, KIR2DS1 and DAP12 nanoclusters are juxtaposed in the resting cell state but coalesce upon receptor ligation. Second, quantitative super-resolution microscopy revealed that phosphorylation of the kinase ZAP-70 or phosphatase SHP-1 is favored in larger KIR nanoclusters. Thus, the size of KIR nanoclusters depends on the transmembrane sequence and affects downstream signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of MLL complex-mediated histone methylation plays a pivotal role in gene expression associated with diseases, but little is known about cellular factors modulating MLL complex activity. Here, we report that SON, previously known as an RNA splicing factor, controls MLL complex-mediated transcriptional initiation. SON binds to DNA near transcription start sites, interacts with menin, and inhibits MLL complex assembly, resulting in decreased H3K4me3 and transcriptional repression. Importantly, alternatively spliced short isoforms of SON are markedly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. The short isoforms compete with full-length SON for chromatin occupancy but lack the menin-binding ability, thereby antagonizing full-length SON function in transcriptional repression while not impairing full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Furthermore, overexpression of a short isoform of SON enhances replating potential of hematopoietic progenitors. Our findings define SON as a fine-tuner of the MLL-menin interaction and reveal short SON overexpression as a marker indicating aberrant transcriptional initiation in leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Small RNAs (sRNAs) from conserved noncoding genes are crucial regulators in bacterial signaling pathways but have remained elusive in the Cpx response to inner membrane stress. Here we report that an alternative biogenesis pathway releasing the conserved mRNA 3′ UTR of stress chaperone CpxP as an ∼60-nt sRNA provides the noncoding arm of the Cpx response. This so-called CpxQ sRNA, generated by general mRNA decay through RNase E, acts as an Hfq-dependent repressor of multiple mRNAs encoding extracytoplasmic proteins. Both CpxQ and the Cpx pathway are required for cell survival under conditions of dissipation of membrane potential. Our discovery of CpxQ illustrates how the conversion of a transcribed 3′ UTR into an sRNA doubles the output of a single mRNA to produce two factors with spatially segregated functions during inner membrane stress: a chaperone that targets problematic proteins in the periplasm and a regulatory RNA that dampens their synthesis in the cytosol.

Abstract: Summary
Four distinct subgroups of cerebellar medulloblastomas (MBs) differ in their histopathology, molecular profiles, and prognosis. c-Myc (Myc) or MycN overexpression in granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) induces Group 3 (G3) or Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) MBs, respectively. Differences in Myc and MycN transcriptional profiles depend, in part, on their interaction with Miz1, which binds strongly to Myc but not MycN, to target sites on chromatin. Myc suppresses ciliogenesis and reprograms the transcriptome of SHH-dependent GNPs through Miz1-dependent gene repression to maintain stemness. Genetic disruption of the Myc/Miz1 interaction inhibited G3 MB development. Target genes of Myc/Miz1 are repressed in human G3 MBs but not in other subgroups. Therefore, the Myc/Miz1 interaction is a defining hallmark of G3 MB development.

Abstract: Summary
We present a genome-scale model of Caenorhabditis elegans metabolism along with the public database ElegCyc (http://elegcyc.bioinf.uni-jena.de:1100), which represents a reference for metabolic pathways in the worm and allows for the visualization as well as analysis of omics datasets. Our model reflects the metabolic peculiarities of C. elegans that make it distinct from other higher eukaryotes and mammals, including mice and humans. We experimentally verify one of these peculiarities by showing that the lifespan-extending effect of L-tryptophan supplementation is dose dependent (hormetic). Finally, we show the utility of our model for analyzing omics datasets through predicting changes in amino acid concentrations after genetic perturbations and analyzing metabolic changes during normal aging as well as during two distinct, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related lifespan-extending treatments. Our analyses reveal a notable similarity in metabolic adaptation between distinct lifespan-extending interventions and point to key pathways affecting lifespan in nematodes.

Abstract: Summary
For muscles to function, myofibers have to stretch and anchor at the myotendinous junction (MTJ), a region rich in extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin signaling is required for MTJ formation, and mutations affecting the cascade lead to muscular dystrophies in mice and humans. Underlying mechanisms for integrin activation at the MTJ and ECM modifications regulating its signaling are unclear. We show that lysyl oxidase-like 3 (LoxL3) is a key regulator of integrin signaling that ensures localized control of the cascade. In LoxL3 mutants, myofibers anchor prematurely or overshoot to adjacent somites, and are loose and lack tension. We find that LoxL3 complexes with and directly oxidizes Fibronectin (FN), an ECM scaffold protein and integrin ligand enriched at the MTJ. We identify a mechanism whereby localized LoxL3 secretion from myofiber termini oxidizes FN, enabling enhanced integrin activation at the tips of myofibers and ensuring correct positioning and anchoring of myofibers along the MTJ.

Abstract: Summary
The androgen receptor (AR) is required for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression, but the function and disease relevance of AR-bound enhancers remain unclear. Here, we identify a group of AR-regulated enhancer RNAs (e.g., PSA eRNA) that are upregulated in CRPC cells, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and patient tissues. PSA eRNA binds to CYCLIN T1, activates P-TEFb, and promotes cis and trans target gene transcription by increasing serine-2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II-Ser2p). We define an HIV-1 TAR RNA-like (TAR-L) motif in PSA eRNA that is required for CYCLIN T1 binding. Using TALEN-mediated gene editing we further demonstrate that this motif is essential for increased Pol II-Ser2p occupancy levels and CRPC cell growth. We have uncovered a P-TEFb activation mechanism and reveal altered eRNA expression that is related to abnormal AR function and may potentially be a therapeutic target in CRPC.

Abstract: The mature spermatozoon of Hemiurus appendiculatus exhibits the general pattern described in most of the digenean namely, two axonemes of the 9 + “1” pattern of the Trepaxonemata, a nucleus, a filiform mitochondrion, external ornamentations of the plasma membrane and parallel cortical microtubules located on one side of the spermatozoon. In this study, we show for the second time in a digenean spermatozoon the presence of microtubules of the second axoneme associated each in a short length with an external ornamentation, seven cortical microtubules, a terminal bulge in the anterior spermatozoon extremity separate from the remainder of the spermatozoon by a transverse constriction and the simultaneous presence of the external ornamentation of the plasma membrane with a filamentous ornamentation. The external ornamentations have a differentiated distribution, cover almost the anterior region of the spermatozoon, are more abundant around the first axoneme and extend backwards over a short distance around the second axoneme. This study also allowed us to reveal for the first time the existence in the Hemiuroidea of an axoneme that begins to disrupt before reaching the front end of the mitochondrion.

Abstract: Summary
Detailed genomic contact maps have revealed that chromosomes are structurally organized in megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs) that encompass smaller subTADs. These domains segregate in the nuclear space to form active and inactive nuclear compartments, but cause and consequence of compartmentalization are largely unknown. Here, we combined lacO/lacR binding platforms with allele-specific 4C technologies to track their precise position in the three-dimensional genome upon recruitment of NANOG, SUV39H1, or EZH2. We observed locked genomic loci resistant to spatial repositioning and unlocked loci that could be repositioned to different nuclear subcompartments with distinct chromatin signatures. Focal protein recruitment caused the entire subTAD, but not surrounding regions, to engage in new genomic contacts. Compartment switching was found uncoupled from transcription changes, and the enzymatic modification of histones per se was insufficient for repositioning. Collectively, this suggests that trans-associated factors influence three-dimensional compartmentalization independent of their cis effect on local chromatin composition and activity.

Dual Regulation of R-Type CaV2.3 Channels by M1 Muscarinic Receptors,

Abstract: Voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels are dynamically modulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The M1 muscarinic receptor stimulation is known to enhance CaV2.3 channel gating through the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Here, we found that M1 receptors also inhibit CaV2.3 currents when the channels are fully activated by PKC. In whole-cell configuration, the application of phorbol 12- myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, potentiated CaV2.3 currents by ~two-fold. After the PMA-induced potentiation, stimulation of M1 receptors decreased the CaV2.3 currents by 52 ± 8%. We examined whether the depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is responsible for the muscarinic suppression of CaV2.3 currents by using two methods: the Danio rerio voltagesensing phosphatase (Dr-VSP) system and the rapamycin- induced translocatable pseudojanin (PJ) system. First, dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 to phosphatidylinositol 4- phosphate (PI(4)P) by Dr-VSP significantly suppressed CaV2.3 currents, by 53 ± 3%. Next, dephosphorylation of both PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 to PI by PJ translocation further decreased the current by up to 66 ± 3%. The results suggest that CaV2.3 currents are modulated by the M1 receptor in a dual mode—that is, potentiation through the activation of PKC and suppression by the depletion of membrane PI(4,5)P2. Our results also suggest that there is rapid turnover between PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane.

Abstract: miR-101 is considered to play an important role in hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to confirm whether Girdin is a target gene of miR-101 and determine the tumor suppressor of miR-101 through Girdin pathway. In our previous studies, we firstly found Girdin protein was overexpressed in HCC tissues, and it closely correlated to tumor size, T stage, TNM stage and Edmondson Steiner stage of HCC patients. After specific small interfering RNA of Girdin was transfected into HepG2 and Huh7.5.1 cells, the proliferation and invasion ability of tumor cells were significantly inhibited. In this study, we further explored the detailed molecular mechanism of Girdin in HCC. Interestingly, we found that miR-101 significantly low-expressed in HCC tissues compared with that in matched normal tissues while Girdin had a relative higher expression, and miR-101 was inversely correlated with Girdin expression. In addition, after miR-101 transfection, the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells were weakened. Furthermore, we confirmed that Girdin is a direct target gene of miR-101. Finally we confirmed Talen-mediated Girdin knockout markedly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC while downregulationof miR-101 significantly restored the inhibitory effect. Our findings suggested that miR-101/Girdin axis could be a potential application of HCC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental structural and functional building blocks of human interphase chromosomes, yet the mechanisms of TAD formation remain unclear. Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model produces TADs and finer-scale features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental observations—including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments—and makes specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences for processes such as enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.

Co-operative and Hierarchical Binding of c-FLIP and Caspase-8: A Unified Model Defines How c-FLIP Isoforms Differentially Control Cell Fate,

Abstract: Summary
The death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) initiates death receptor-induced apoptosis. DISC assembly and activation are controlled by c-FLIP isoforms, which function as pro-apoptotic (c-FLIPL only) or anti-apoptotic (c-FLIPL/c-FLIPS) regulators of procaspase-8 activation. Current models assume that c-FLIP directly competes with procaspase-8 for recruitment to FADD. Using a functional reconstituted DISC, structure-guided mutagenesis, and quantitative LC-MS/MS, we show that c-FLIPL/S binding to the DISC is instead a co-operative procaspase-8-dependent process. FADD initially recruits procaspase-8, which in turn recruits and heterodimerizes with c-FLIPL/S via a hierarchical binding mechanism. Procaspase-8 activation is regulated by the ratio of unbound c-FLIPL/S to procaspase-8, which determines composition of the procaspase-8:c-FLIPL/S heterodimer. Thus, procaspase-8:c-FLIPL exhibits localized enzymatic activity and is preferentially an activator, promoting DED-mediated procaspase-8 oligomer assembly, whereas procaspase-8:c-FLIPS lacks activity and potently blocks procaspase-8 activation. This co-operative hierarchical binding model explains the dual role of c-FLIPL and crucially defines how c-FLIP isoforms differentially control cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) plays an important role in maintaining lysosome homeostasis. During ALR, lysosomes are reformed by recycling lysosomal components from autolysosomes. The most noticeable step of ALR is autolysosome tubulation, but it is currently unknown how the process is regulated. Here, using an approach combining in vivo studies and in vitro reconstitution, we found that the kinesin motor protein KIF5B is required for autolysosome tubulation and that KIF5B drives autolysosome tubulation by pulling on the autolysosomal membrane. Furthermore, we show that KIF5B directly interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Kinesin motors are recruited and clustered on autolysosomes via interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a clathrin-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that clathrin promotes formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched microdomains, which are required for clustering of KIF5B. Our study reveals a mechanism by which autolysosome tubulation was generated.

Pasteurella multocida toxin: Targeting mast cell secretory granules during kiss-and-run secretion,

Abstract: Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), a virulence factor of the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium P. multocida, is a 146kDa protein belonging to the A–B class of toxins. Once inside a target cell, the A domain deamidates the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, thereby activating downstream signaling cascades. However, little is known about how PMT selects and enters its cellular targets. We therefore studied PMT binding and uptake in porcine cultured intestinal mucosal explants to identify susceptible cells in the epithelium and underlying lamina propria. In comparison with Vibrio cholera B-subunit, a well-known enterotoxin taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, PMT binding to the epithelial brush border was scarce, and no uptake into enterocytes was detected by 2h, implying that none of the glycolipids in the brush border are a functional receptor for PMT. However, in the lamina propria, PMT distinctly accumulated in the secretory granules of mast cells. This also occurred at 4°C, ruling out endocytosis, but suggestive of uptake via pores that connect the granules to the cell surface. Mast cell granules are known to secrete their contents by a “kiss-and-run” mechanism, and we propose that PMT may exploit this secretory mechanism to gain entry into this particular cell type.

Abstract: Summary
It has been posited that the regulation of burst/tonic firing in the thalamus could function as a mechanism for controlling not only how much but what kind of information is conveyed to downstream cortical targets. Yet how this gating mechanism is adaptively modulated on fast timescales by ongoing sensory inputs in rich sensory environments remains unknown. Using single-unit recordings in the rat vibrissa thalamus (VPm), we found that the degree of bottom-up adaptation modulated thalamic burst/tonic firing as well as the synchronization of bursting across the thalamic population along a continuum for which the extremes facilitate detection or discrimination of sensory inputs. Optogenetic control of baseline membrane potential in thalamus further suggests that this regulation may result from an interplay between adaptive changes in thalamic membrane potential and synaptic drive from inputs to thalamus, setting the stage for an intricate control strategy upon which cortical computation is built.

Abstract: Summary
The creation of translation-competent mRNA is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcripts being modified by addition of the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap. The factors that mediate splicing, nuclear export, and translation initiation are recruited to the transcript via the cap. The cap structure is formed by several activities and completed by RNMT (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase), which catalyzes N7 methylation of the cap guanosine. We report that CDK1-cyclin B1 phosphorylates the RNMT regulatory domain on T77 during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. RNMT T77 phosphorylation activates the enzyme both directly and indirectly by inhibiting interaction with KPNA2, an RNMT inhibitor. RNMT T77 phosphorylation results in elevated m7G cap methyltransferase activity at the beginning of G1 phase, coordinating mRNA capping with the burst of transcription that occurs following nuclear envelope reformation. RNMT T77 phosphorylation is required for the production of cohort of proteins, and inhibiting T77 phosphorylation reduces the cell proliferation rate.

Abstract: Summary
Class switch recombination (CSR) requires activation-induced deaminase (AID) to instigate double-stranded DNA breaks at the immunoglobulin locus. DNA breaks activate the DNA damage response (DDR) by inducing phosphorylation of histone H2AX followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. We carried out a genome-wide screen to identify CSR factors. We found that Usp22, Eny2, and Atxn7, members of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) deubiquitination module, are required for deubiquitination of H2BK120ub following DNA damage, are critical for CSR, and function downstream of AID. The SAGA deubiquitinase activity was required for optimal irradiation-induced γH2AX formation, and failure to remove H2BK120ub inhibits ATM- and DNAPK-induced γH2AX formation. Consistent with this effect, these proteins were found to function upstream of various double-stranded DNA repair pathways. This report demonstrates that deubiquitination of histone H2B impacts the early stages of the DDR and is required for the DNA repair phase of CSR.

Abstract: Summary
Prediabetes, a state of mild glucose intolerance, can persist for years before a sudden decline in beta cell function and rapid deterioration to overt diabetes. The mechanism underlying this tipping point of beta cell dysfunction remains unknown. Here, the furan fatty acid metabolite CMPF was evaluated in a prospective cohort. Those who developed overt diabetes had a significant increase in CMPF over time, whereas prediabetics maintained chronically elevated levels, even up to 5 years before diagnosis. To evaluate the effect of increasing CMPF on diabetes progression, we used obese, insulin-resistant models of prediabetes. CMPF accelerated diabetes development by inducing metabolic remodeling, resulting in preferential utilization of fatty acids over glucose. This was associated with diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased ROS formation, and accumulation of proinsulin, all characteristics of human diabetes. Thus, an increase in CMPF may represent the tipping point in diabetes development by accelerating beta cell dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
In the absence of low-level ER-to-mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer, ATP levels fall, and AMPK-dependent, mTOR-independent autophagy is induced as an essential survival mechanism in many cell types. Here, we demonstrate that tumorigenic cancer cell lines, transformed primary human fibroblasts, and tumors in vivo respond similarly but that autophagy is insufficient for survival, and cancer cells die while their normal counterparts are spared. Cancer cell death is due to compromised bioenergetics that can be rescued with metabolic substrates or nucleotides and caused by necrosis associated with mitotic catastrophe during their proliferation. Our findings reveal an unexpected dependency on constitutive Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria for viability of tumorigenic cells and suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ addiction is a feature of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cofilin/actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) proteins are critical nodes that relay signals from protein kinase cascades to the actin cytoskeleton, in particular through site-specific phosphorylation at residue Ser3. This is important for regulation of the roles of cofilin in severing and stabilizing actin filaments. Consequently, cofilin/ADF Ser3 phosphorylation is tightly controlled as an almost exclusive substrate for LIM kinases. Here we determine the LIMK1:cofilin-1 co-crystal structure. We find an interface that is distinct from canonical kinase-substrate interactions. We validate this previously unobserved mechanism for high-fidelity kinase-substrate recognition by in vitro kinase assays, examination of cofilin phosphorylation in mammalian cells, and functional analysis in S. cerevisiae. The interface is conserved across all LIM kinases. Remarkably, we also observe both pre- and postphosphotransfer states in the same crystal lattice. This study therefore provides a molecular understanding of how kinase-substrate recognition acts as a gatekeeper to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that plays a housekeeping role in eliminating protein aggregates and organelles and is activated during nutrient deprivation to generate metabolites and energy. Autophagy plays a significant role in tumorigenesis, although opposing context-dependent functions of autophagy in cancer have complicated efforts to target autophagy for therapeutic purposes. We demonstrate that autophagy inhibition reduces tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and attenuates metastasis in vivo. Numerous abnormally large focal adhesions (FAs) accumulate in autophagy-deficient tumor cells, reflecting a role for autophagy in FA disassembly through targeted degradation of paxillin. We demonstrate that paxillin interacts with processed LC3 through a conserved LIR motif in the amino-terminal end of paxillin and that this interaction is regulated by oncogenic SRC activity. Together, these data establish a function for autophagy in FA turnover, tumor cell motility, and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Current fate mapping and imaging platforms are limited in their ability to capture dynamic behaviors of epithelial cells. To deconstruct regenerating adult epithelial tissue at single-cell resolution, we created a multicolor system, skinbow, that barcodes the superficial epithelial cell (SEC) population of zebrafish skin with dozens of distinguishable tags. With image analysis to directly segment and simultaneously track hundreds of SECs in vivo over entire surface lifetimes, we readily quantified the orchestration of cell emergence, growth, repositioning, and loss under homeostatic conditions and after exfoliation or appendage amputation. We employed skinbow-based imaging in conjunction with a live reporter of epithelial stem cell cycle activity and as an instrument to evaluate the effects of reactive oxygen species on SEC behavior during epithelial regeneration. Our findings introduce a platform for large-scale, quantitative in vivo imaging of regenerating skin and reveal unanticipated collective dynamism in epithelial cell size, mobility, and interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal aneuploidy and specific gene mutations are recognized early hallmarks of many oncogenic processes. However, the net effect of these abnormalities has generally not been explored. We focused on transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in Down syndrome, which is characteristically associated with somatic mutations in GATA1. To better understand functional interplay between trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations in hematopoiesis, we constructed cellular disease models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genome-editing technologies. Comparative analysis of these engineered iPSCs demonstrated that trisomy 21 perturbed hematopoietic development through the enhanced production of early hematopoietic progenitors and the upregulation of mutated GATA1, resulting in the accelerated production of aberrantly differentiated cells. These effects were mediated by dosage alterations of RUNX1, ETS2, and ERG, which are located in a critical 4-Mb region of chromosome 21. Our study provides insight into the genetic synergy that contributes to multi-step leukemogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The thymus provides a unique microenvironment enabling development and selection of T lymphocytes. Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play a pivotal role in this process by facilitating negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes and the generation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Although studies have highlighted the non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway as the key regulator of mTEC development, comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathways regulating this process still remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that the development of functionally competent mTECs is regulated by the histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3). Although histone deacetylases are global transcriptional regulators, this effect is highly specific only to Hdac3, as neither Hdac1 nor Hdac2 inactivation caused mTEC ablation. Interestingly, Hdac3 induces an mTEC-specific transcriptional program independently of the previously recognized RANK-NFκB signaling pathway. Thus, our findings uncover yet another layer of complexity of TEC lineage divergence and highlight Hdac3 as a major and specific molecular switch crucial for mTEC differentiation.

Abstract: Isolated supraoptic neurones generate spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations in isolated conditions. Here we report in depth analysis of the contribution of plasmalemmal ion channels (Ca2+, Na+), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), intracellular Ca2+ release channels (InsP3Rs and RyRs), Ca2+ storage organelles, plasma membrane Ca2+ pump and intracellular signal transduction cascades into spontaneous Ca2+ activity. While removal of extracellular Ca2+ or incubation with non-specific voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) blocker Cd2+ suppressed the oscillations, neither Ni2+ nor TTA-P2, the T-type VGCC blockers, had an effect. Inhibitors of VGCC nicardipine, ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-conotoxin MVIIC, ω-agatoxin IVA (for L-, N-, P and P/Q-type channels, respectively) did not affect [Ca2+]i oscillations. In contrast, a specific R-type VGCC blocker SNX-482 attenuated [Ca2+]i oscillations. Incubation with TTX had no effect, whereas removal of the extracellular Na+ or application of an inhibitor of the reverse operation mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger KB-R7943 blocked the oscillations. The mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP irreversibly blocked spontaneous [Ca2+]i activity. Exposure of neurones to Ca2+ mobilisers (thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, caffeine and ryanodine); 4-aminopyridine (A-type K+ current blocker); phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase pathways blockers U-73122, Rp-cAMP, SQ-22536 and H-89 had no effect. Oscillations were blocked by GABA, but not by glutamate, apamin or dynorphin. In conclusion, spontaneous oscillations in magnocellular neurones are mediated by a concerted action of R-type Ca2+ channels and the NCX fluctuating between forward and reverse modes.

Abstract: Summary
SDHAF1 mutations cause a rare mitochondrial complex II (CII) deficiency, which manifests as infantile leukoencephalopathy with elevated levels of serum and white matter succinate and lactate. Here, we demonstrate that SDHAF1 contributes to iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster incorporation into the Fe-S subunit of CII, SDHB. SDHAF1 transiently binds to aromatic peptides of SDHB through an arginine-rich region in its C terminus and specifically engages a Fe-S donor complex, consisting of the scaffold, holo-ISCU, and the co-chaperone-chaperone pair, HSC20-HSPA9, through an LYR motif near its N-terminal domain. Pathogenic mutations of SDHAF1 abrogate binding to SDHB, which impairs biogenesis of holo-SDHB and results in LONP1-mediated degradation of SDHB. Riboflavin treatment was found to ameliorate the neurologic condition of patients. We demonstrate that riboflavin enhances flavinylation of SDHA and reduces levels of succinate and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1α and -2α, explaining the favorable response of patients to riboflavin.
