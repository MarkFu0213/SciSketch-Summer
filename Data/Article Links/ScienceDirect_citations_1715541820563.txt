Abstract: Summary
Here, we present a simple and highly efficient method for generating and detecting mutations of any gene in Drosophila melanogaster through the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated). We show that injection of RNA into the Drosophila embryo can induce highly efficient mutagenesis of desired target genes in up to 88% of injected flies. These mutations can be transmitted through the germline to make stable lines. Our system provides at least a 10-fold improvement in efficiency over previously published reports, enabling wider application of this technique. We also describe a simple and highly sensitive method of detecting mutations in the target gene by high-resolution melt analysis and discuss how the new technology enables the study of gene function.

Abstract: Summary
Cells must accurately replicate and segregate their DNA once per cell cycle in order to successfully transmit genetic information. During S phase in the presence of agents that cause replication stress, ATR-dependent checkpoints regulate origin firing and the replication machinery as well as prevent untimely mitosis. Here, we investigate the role of ATR during unperturbed growth in vertebrate cells. In the absence of ATR, individual replication forks progress more slowly, and an increased number of replication origins are activated. These cells also enter mitosis early and divide more rapidly, culminating in chromosome bridges and laggards at anaphase, failed cytokinesis, and cell death. Interestingly, cell death can be rescued by prolonging mitosis with partial inhibition of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Our data indicate that one of the essential roles of ATR during normal growth is to minimize the level of unreplicated DNA before the onset of mitosis.

Abstract: The assembly of STIM1 protein puncta near endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions is required for optimal activation of store-operated channels (SOC). The mechanisms controlling the translocation of STIM1 puncta to ER-PM junctions remain largely unknown. In the present study, we have explored the role of the microtubule binding protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), on STIM1 puncta and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). APC-depleted cells showed reduced STIM1 puncta near ER-PM junctions, instead puncta is found at the ER surrounding the cell nucleus. Reduced STIM1 puncta near ER-PM junctions in APC-depleted cells correlates with a strong inhibition of SOCE and diminished Orai whole-cell currents. Immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy co-localization studies indicate that, upon depletion of the ER, STIM1 dissociates from EB1 and associates to APC. Deletion analysis identified an APC-binding domain in the carboxyl terminus of STIM1 (STIM1 650–685). These results together position APC as an important element in facilitating the translocation of STIM1 puncta near ER-PM junctions, which in turn is required for efficient SOCE and Orai activation upon depletion of the ER.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from transcription initiation into elongation is controlled by transcription factors, which recruit positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to promoters to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II. A fraction of P-TEFb is recruited as part of the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), which inactivates the kinase and prevents elongation. However, it is unclear how P-TEFb is captured from the promoter-bound 7SK snRNP to activate elongation. Here, we describe a mechanism by which transcription factors mediate the enzymatic release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP at promoters to trigger activation in a gene-specific manner. We demonstrate that Tat recruits PPM1G/PP2Cγ to locally disassemble P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP at the HIV promoter via dephosphorylation of the kinase T loop. Similar to Tat, nuclear factor (NF)-κB recruits PPM1G in a stimulus-dependent manner to activate elongation at inflammatory-responsive genes. Recruitment of PPM1G to promoter-assembled 7SK snRNP provides a paradigm for rapid gene activation through transcriptional pause release.

Abstract: CD137 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. Interaction of CD137 with its ligand (CD137L) affects the apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation of immune cells. Interestingly, the CD137 receptor/ligand system involves the bi-directional transduction of signals. The expression of CD137 and its ligand is not restricted to immune organs, but can also be detected in a wide variety of tissues such as the brain, kidney, lung and heart. However, its role in brain is largely unknown. This study was performed to determine the role of CD137L reverse signaling in the apoptosis of neural stem cells. We identified the expression of CD137 and its ligand in C17.2 neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic cerebellum. We found that the activation of CD137L reverse signaling by CD137 resulted in a decrease in cell adhesion to the fibronectin-coated culture basement, thus causing detachment-induced cell death. Furthermore, we showed that the cell death induced by CD137 was completely ameliorated by integrin activators and caspase inhibitors. Therefore we suggest that CD137L reverse signaling exerts a pro-apoptotic effect by suppressing integrin-mediated survival signals in neural stem cells.

Abstract: Neuron–astrocyte interactions are important for brain computations and synaptic plasticity. Perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) contain a high density of transporters that are responsible for neurotransmitter clearance. Metabotropic glutamate receptors are thought to trigger Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores in PAPs in response to synaptic activity. Our ultrastructural study revealed that PAPs are actually devoid of Ca2+ stores and have a high surface-to-volume ratio favorable for uptake. Astrocytic processes containing Ca2+ stores were located further away from the synapses and could therefore respond to changes in ambient glutamate. Thus, the anatomic data do not support communication involving Ca2+ stores in tripartite synapses, but rather point to extrasynaptic communication.
Keywords: Astrocyte; Postsynaptic density; Perisynaptic processes; Neuron–glia interaction

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to promote tumor migration and invasion. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-β family expressed in a variety of human carcinoma cell lines. The role of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), the most powerful osteogenic factor, in osteosarcoma (OS) progression has not been fully clarified. The expression of BMP9 and its receptors in OS cell lines was analyzed by RT-PCR. We found that BMP9 and its receptors were expressed in OS cell lines. We further investigated the influence of BMP9 on the biological behaviors of OS cells. BMP9 overexpression in the OS cell lines 143B and MG63 inhibited in vitro cell migration and invasion. We further investigated the expression of a panel of cancer-related genes and found that BMP9 overexpression increased the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 proteins, increased the expression of ID1, and reduced the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in OS cells. BMP9 silencing induced the opposite effects. We also found that BMP9 may not affect the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis to regulate the invasiveness and metastatic capacity of OS cells. Interestingly, CXCR4 was expressed in both 143B and MG63 cells, while CXCL12 was only detected in MG63 cells. Taken together, we hypothesize that BMP9 inhibits the migration and invasiveness of OS cells through a Smad-dependent pathway by downregulating the expression and activity of MMP9.

Abstract: Summary
The BCL6 transcriptional repressor is required for the development of germinal center (GC) B cells and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Although BCL6 can recruit multiple corepressors, its transcriptional repression mechanism of action in normal and malignant B cells is unknown. We find that in B cells, BCL6 mostly functions through two independent mechanisms that are collectively essential to GC formation and DLBCL, both mediated through its N-terminal BTB domain. These are (1) the formation of a unique ternary BCOR-SMRT complex at promoters, with each corepressor binding to symmetrical sites on BCL6 homodimers linked to specific epigenetic chromatin features, and (2) the “toggling” of active enhancers to a poised but not erased conformation through SMRT-dependent H3K27 deacetylation, which is mediated by HDAC3 and opposed by p300 histone acetyltransferase. Dynamic toggling of enhancers provides a basis for B cells to undergo rapid transcriptional and phenotypic changes in response to signaling or environmental cues.

Abstract: Summary
The small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes have been widely used as a model system for understanding transcriptional regulation due to the unique aspects of their promoter structure, selectivity for either RNA polymerase (Pol) II or III, and because of their unique mechanism of termination that is tightly linked with the promoter. Recently, we identified the little elongation complex (LEC) in Drosophila that is required for the expression of Pol II-transcribed snRNA genes. Here, using Drosophila and mammalian systems, we provide genetic and molecular evidence that LEC functions in at least two phases of snRNA transcription: an initiation step requiring the ICE1 subunit, and an elongation step requiring ELL.

Abstract: Summary
A small toolkit of morphogens is used repeatedly to direct development, raising the question of how context dictates interpretation of the same cue. One example is the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway that in human embryonic stem cells fulfills two opposite functions: pluripotency maintenance and mesendoderm (ME) specification. Using proteomics coupled to analysis of genome occupancy, we uncover a regulatory complex composed of transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway (TAZ/YAP/TEAD), the TGF-β pathway (SMAD2/3), and the pluripotency regulator OCT4 (TSO). TSO collaborates with NuRD repressor complexes to buffer pluripotency gene expression while suppressing ME genes. Importantly, the SMAD DNA binding partner FOXH1, a major specifier of ME, is found near TSO elements, and upon fate specification we show that TSO is disrupted with subsequent SMAD-FOXH1 induction of ME. These studies define switch-enhancer elements and provide a framework to understand how cellular context dictates interpretation of the same morphogen signal in development.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination is an essential step in protein-coding gene expression that is mediated by pre-mRNA processing activities and DNA-encoded terminator elements. Although much is known about the role of pre-mRNA processing in termination, our understanding of the characteristics and generality of terminator elements is limited. Whereas promoter databases list up to 40,000 known and potential Pol II promoter sequences, fewer than ten Pol II terminator sequences have been described. Using our knowledge of the human β-globin terminator mechanism, we have developed a selection strategy for mapping mammalian Pol II terminator elements. We report the identification of 78 cotranscriptional cleavage (CoTC)-type terminator elements at endogenous gene loci. The results of this analysis pave the way for the full understanding of Pol II termination pathways and their roles in gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Integrative organ crosstalk regulates key aspects of energy homeostasis, and its dysregulation may underlie metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. To test the hypothesis that crosstalk between the liver and pancreatic islets modulates β cell growth in response to insulin resistance, we used the liver-specific insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, a unique model that exhibits dramatic islet hyperplasia. Using complementary in vivo parabiosis and transplantation assays, as well as in vitro islet culture approaches, we demonstrate that humoral, nonneural, non-cell-autonomous factor(s) induces β cell proliferation in LIRKO mice. Furthermore, we report that a hepatocyte-derived factor(s) stimulates mouse and human β cell proliferation in ex vivo assays, independent of ambient glucose and insulin levels. These data implicate the liver as a critical source of β cell growth factor(s) in insulin-resistant states.

Snapin accelerates exocytosis at low intracellular calcium concentration in mouse chromaffin cells,

Abstract: Snapin associates with SNAP-25 and with assembled SNARE complexes, stabilizing the coupling between Synaptotagmin-1 and SNAP-25. Deletion of Snapin reduces releasable pools of vesicles in chromaffin cells and reduces synchronous release of neurotransmitter in cortical neurons. Snapin deletion leads to a deficit in exocytosis at low calcium concentration with no change in the threshold calcium concentration for exocytosis in chromaffin cells. In order to determine whether Snapin deletion alters release rates or calcium dependence, we examined the effect of overexpression of wild type Snapin on readily releasable pool kinetics and pool size in mouse chromaffin cells. Modest increases in intracellular calcium induced by flash-photolysis unmasked a rapidly releasing component of secretion which was enhanced when Snapin was overexpressed. This result indicates that Snapin allows rapid release at lower intracellular calcium levels at which release of the remaining RRP occurs more slowly.

Abstract: Summary
The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is a well-established mediator of body weight homeostasis. However, the neurotransmitter(s) that mediate MC4R function remain largely unknown; as a result, little is known about the second-order neurons of the MC4R neural pathway. Single-minded 1 (Sim1)-expressing brain regions, which include the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVH), represent key brain sites that mediate melanocortin action. We conditionally restored MC4R expression in Sim1 neurons in the background of Mc4r-null mice. The restoration dramatically reduced obesity in Mc4r-null mice. The anti-obesity effect was completely reversed by selective disruption of glutamate release from those same Sim1 neurons. The reversal was caused by lower energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Corroboratively, selective disruption of glutamate release from adult PVH neurons led to rapid obesity development via reduced energy expenditure and hyperphagia. Thus, this study establishes glutamate as the primary neurotransmitter that mediates MC4Rs on Sim1 neurons in body weight regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a recently discovered metabolic regulator. Exogenous FGF21 produces beneficial metabolic effects in animal models; however, the translation of these observations to humans has not been tested. Here, we studied the effects of LY2405319 (LY), a variant of FGF21, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept trial in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Patients received placebo or 3, 10, or 20 mg of LY daily for 28 days. LY treatment produced significant improvements in dyslipidemia, including decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a shift to a potentially less atherogenic apolipoprotein concentration profile. Favorable effects on body weight, fasting insulin, and adiponectin were also detected. However, only a trend toward glucose lowering was observed. These results indicate that FGF21 is bioactive in humans and suggest that FGF21-based therapies may be effective for the treatment of selected metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulation of μ-opioid receptors (OPRMs) brings powerful pain relief, but it also leads to the development of tolerance and addiction. Ensuing withdrawal in abstinent patients manifests itself with severe symptoms, including cold hyperalgesia, often preventing addicted patients from successfully completing the rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, OPRMs have been a central point of many studies. Nonetheless, a satisfactory understanding of the pathways leading to distorted sensory responses during opiate administration and abstinence is far from complete. Here, we present a mechanism that leads to modulation by OPRMs of one of the sensory responses, thermosensation. Activation of OPRM1 leads to internalization of a cold-sensor TRPM8, which can be reversed by a follow-up treatment with the inverse OPRM agonist naloxone. Knockout of TRPM8 protein leads to a decrease in morphine-induced cold analgesia. The proposed pathway represents a universal mechanism that is probably shared by regulatory pathways modulating general pain sensation in response to opioid treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The placenta provides the interface for gas and nutrient exchange between the mother and the fetus. Despite its critical function in sustaining pregnancy, the stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of the placental exchange interface are poorly understood. We identified an Epcamhi labyrinth trophoblast progenitor (LaTP) in mouse placenta that at a clonal level generates all labyrinth trophoblast subtypes, syncytiotrophoblasts I and II, and sinusoidal trophoblast giant cells. Moreover, we discovered that hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling is required for sustaining proliferation of LaTP during midgestation. Loss of trophoblast c-Met also disrupted terminal differentiation and polarization of syncytiotrophoblasts, leading to intrauterine fetal growth restriction, fetal liver hypocellularity, and demise. Identification of this c-Met-dependent multipotent LaTP provides a landmark in the poorly defined placental stem/progenitor cell hierarchy and may help us understand pregnancy complications caused by a defective placental exchange.

Abstract: Summary
The individuals carrying melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants, especially those associated with red hair color, fair skin, and poor tanning ability (RHC trait), are more prone to melanoma; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Here, we report that UVB exposure triggers phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) interaction with wild-type (WT), but not RHC-associated MC1R variants, which protects PTEN from WWP2-mediated degradation, leading to AKT inactivation. Strikingly, the biological consequences of the failure of MC1R variants to suppress PI3K/AKT signaling are highly context dependent. In primary melanocytes, hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling leads to premature senescence; in the presence of BRAFV600E, MC1R deficiency-induced elevated PI3K/AKT signaling drives oncogenic transformation. These studies establish the MC1R-PTEN axis as a central regulator for melanocytes’ response to UVB exposure and reveal the molecular basis underlying the association between MC1R variants and melanomagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
SR proteins are well-characterized RNA binding proteins that promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). However, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of SR proteins in the cell. Here, we report global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins, SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (SC35), using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unexpectedly, we find that these SR proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. Further analyses reveal that loss of one SR protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other SR proteins at the affected exons. Therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one SR protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other SR proteins in mammalian genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have shown that lysines can be posttranslationally modified by various types of acylations. However, except for acetylation, very little is known about their scope and cellular distribution. We mapped thousands of succinylation sites in bacteria (E. coli), yeast (S. cerevisiae), human (HeLa) cells, and mouse liver tissue, demonstrating widespread succinylation in diverse organisms. A majority of succinylation sites in bacteria, yeast, and mouse liver were acetylated at the same position. Quantitative analysis of succinylation in yeast showed that succinylation was globally altered by growth conditions and mutations that affected succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating that succinylation levels are globally affected by succinyl-CoA concentration. We preferentially detected succinylation on abundant proteins, suggesting that succinylation occurs at a low level and that many succinylation sites remain unidentified. These data provide a systems-wide view of succinylation and its dynamic regulation and show its extensive overlap with acetylation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via the uniporter is central to cell metabolism, signaling, and survival. Recent studies identified MCU as the uniporter’s likely pore and MICU1, an EF-hand protein, as its critical regulator. How this complex decodes dynamic cytoplasmic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) signals, to tune out small [Ca2+]c increases yet permit pulse transmission, remains unknown. We report that loss of MICU1 in mouse liver and cultured cells causes mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during small [Ca2+]c elevations but an attenuated response to agonist-induced [Ca2+]c pulses. The latter reflects loss of positive cooperativity, likely via the EF-hands. MICU1 faces the intermembrane space and responds to [Ca2+]c changes. Prolonged MICU1 loss leads to an adaptive increase in matrix Ca2+ binding, yet cells show impaired oxidative metabolism and sensitization to Ca2+ overload. Collectively, the data indicate that MICU1 senses the [Ca2+]c to establish the uniporter’s threshold and gain, thereby allowing mitochondria to properly decode different inputs.

Abstract: RANKL induces the formation of osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption. Herein, we investigated the role of SWAP-70-like adapter of T cells (SLAT) in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Expression levels of SLAT were reduced during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Overexpression of SLAT in BMMs inhibited TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclast formation and attenuated the expression of NFATc1, which is an important modulator in osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, silencing of SLAT by RNA interference enhanced osteoclast formation as well as NFATc1 expression. In addition, SLAT was involved in RANKL-induced JNK activation in osteoclasts. Taken together, our data suggest that SLAT acts as a negative modulator of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The inflammatory microenvironment promotes skin tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which cells protect themselves from inflammatory signals are unknown. Downregulation of IKKα promotes skin tumor progression from papillomas to squamous cell carcinomas, which is frequently accompanied by genomic instability, including aneuploid chromosomes and extra centrosomes. In this study, we found that IKKα promoted oligomerization of nucleophosmin (NPM), a negative centrosome duplication regulator, which further enhanced NPM and centrosome association, inhibited centrosome amplification, and maintained genome integrity. Levels of NPM hexamers and IKKα were conversely associated with skin tumor progression. Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine-induced IKKα activation promoted the formation of NPM oligomers and reduced centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells, whereas kinase-dead IKKα blocked this connection. Therefore, our findings suggest a mechanism in which an IKKα-NPM axis may use inflammatory signals to suppress centrosome amplification, promote genomic integrity, and prevent tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
We have translated a powerful genetic tool, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), from mammalian systems to Drosophila melanogaster to selectively, rapidly, reversibly, and dose-dependently control behaviors and physiological processes in the fly. DREADDs are muscarinic acetylcholine G protein-coupled receptors evolved for loss of affinity to acetylcholine and for the ability to be fully activated by an otherwise biologically inert chemical, clozapine-N-oxide. We demonstrate its ability to control a variety of behaviors and processes in larvae and adults, including heart rate, sensory processing, diurnal behavior, learning and memory, and courtship. The advantages of this particular technology include the dose-responsive control of behaviors, the lack of a need for specialized equipment, and the capacity to remotely control signaling in essentially all neuronal and nonneuronal fly tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Because metabolites are hypothesized to play key roles as markers and effectors of cardiometabolic diseases, recent studies have sought to annotate the genetic determinants of circulating metabolite levels. We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 217 plasma metabolites, including >100 not measured in prior GWAS, in 2076 participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). For the majority of analytes, we find that estimated heritability explains >20% of interindividual variation, and that variation attributable to heritable factors is greater than that attributable to clinical factors. Further, we identify 31 genetic loci associated with plasma metabolites, including 23 that have not previously been reported. Importantly, we include GWAS results for all surveyed metabolites and demonstrate how this information highlights a role for AGXT2 in cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol metabolism. Thus, our study outlines the relative contributions of inherited and clinical factors on the plasma metabolome and provides a resource for metabolism research.

Abstract: Summary
The equalization of pericentric heterochromatin from distinct parental origins following fertilization is essential for genome function and development. The recent implication of noncoding transcripts in this process raises questions regarding the connection between RNA and the nuclear organization of distinct chromatin environments. Our study addresses the interrelationship between replication and transcription of the two parental pericentric heterochromatin (PHC) domains and their reorganization during early embryonic development. We demonstrate that the replication of PHC is dispensable for its clustering at the late two-cell stage. In contrast, using parthenogenetic embryos, we show that pericentric transcripts are essential for this reorganization independent of the chromatin marks associated with the PHC domains. Finally, our discovery that only reverse pericentric transcripts are required for both the nuclear reorganization of PHC and development beyond the two-cell stage challenges current views on heterochromatin organization.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major causative agent of bacterial sepsis, has been used by many laboratories in genome-wide expression profiling of the LPS response. However, these studies have predominantly used in vitro cultured macrophages (Macs), which may not accurately reflect the LPS response of these innate immune cells in vivo. To overcome this limitation and to identify inflammatory genes in vivo, we have profiled genome-wide expression patterns in non-lymphoid, splenic myeloid cells extracted directly from LPS-treated mice. Genes encoding factors known to be involved in mediating or regulating inflammatory processes, such as cytokines and chemokines, as well as many genes whose immunological functions are not well known, were strongly induced by LPS after 3 h or 8 h of treatment. Most of the highly LPS-responsive genes that we randomly selected from the microarray data were independently confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, implying that our microarray data are quite reliable. When our in vivo data were compared to previously reported microarray data for in vitro LPS-treated Macs, a significant proportion (~20%) of the in vivo LPS-responsive genes defined in this study were specific to cellsexposed to LPS in vivo, but a larger proportion of them (~60%) were influenced by LPS in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This result indicates that our in vivo LPS- responsive gene set includes not only previously identified in vitro LPS-responsive genes but also novel LPS- responsive genes. Both types of genes would be a valuable resource in the future for understanding inflammatory responses in vivo.

Abstract: TRPV5 and TRPV6 are two major calcium transport pathways in the human body maintaining calcium homeostasis. TRPV5 is mainly expressed in the distal convoluted and connecting tubule where it is the major, regulated pathway for calcium reabsorption. TRPV6 serves as an important calcium entry pathway in the duodenum and the placenta. Previously, we showed that human TRPV6 (hTRPV6) transports several heavy metals. In this study we tested whether human TRPV5 (hTRPV5) also transports cadmium and zinc, and whether hTRPV5 together with hTRPV6 are involved in cadmium and zinc toxicity. The hTRPV5 mRNA and protein were expressed in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pTagRFP-C1-hTRPV5. The overexpression of the hTRPV5 protein at the plasma membrane was revealed by cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence techniques. We observed that both cadmium and zinc permeate hTRPV5 in ion imaging experiments using Fura-2 or Newport Green DCF. Our results were further confirmed using whole-cell patch clamp technique. Transient overexpression of hTRPV5 or hTRPV6 sensitized cells to cadmium and zinc. Toxicity curves of cadmium and zinc were also shifted in hTRPV6 expressing HEK293 cells clones. Our results suggest that TRPV5 and TRPV6 are crucial gates controlling cadmium and zinc levels in the human body especially under low calcium dietary conditions, when these channels are maximally upregulated.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric cell division plays a crucial role in cell differentiation, unequal replicative senescence, and stem cell maintenance. In budding yeast, the identities of mother and daughter cells begin to diverge at bud emergence when distinct plasma-membrane domains are formed and separated by a septin ring. However, the mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. Here, we show that septins recruited to the site of polarization by Cdc42-GTP inhibit Cdc42 activity in a negative feedback loop, and this inhibition depends on Cdc42 GTPase-activating proteins. Combining live-cell imaging and computational modeling, we demonstrate that the septin ring is sculpted by polarized exocytosis, which creates a hole in the accumulating septin density and relieves the inhibition of Cdc42. The nascent ring generates a sharp boundary that confines the Cdc42 activity and exocytosis strictly to its enclosure and thus clearly delineates the daughter cell identity. Our findings define a fundamental mechanism underlying eukaryotic cell fate differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The inhibition of transcriptional elongation plays an important role in gene regulation in metazoans, including C. elegans. Here, we combine genomic and biochemical approaches to dissect a role of ZFP-1, the C. elegans AF10 homolog, in transcriptional control. We show that ZFP-1 and its interacting partner DOT-1.1 have a global role in negatively modulating the level of polymerase II (Pol II) transcription on essential widely expressed genes. Moreover, the ZFP-1/DOT-1.1 complex contributes to progressive Pol II pausing on essential genes during development and to rapid Pol II pausing during stress response. The slowing down of Pol II transcription by ZFP-1/DOT-1.1 is associated with an increase in H3K79 methylation and a decrease in H2B monoubiquitination, which promotes transcription. We propose a model wherein the recruitment of ZFP-1/DOT-1.1 and deposition of H3K79 methylation at highly expressed genes initiates a negative feedback mechanism for the modulation of their expression.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive caloric intake leading to obesity is associated with insulin resistance and dysfunction of islet β cells. High-fat feeding decreases desnutrin (also called ATGL/PNPLA2) levels in islets. Here we show that desnutrin ablation via RIP-Cre (βKO) or RIP-CreER results in hyperglycemia with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Due to decreased lipolysis, islets have higher TAG content but lower free FA levels. βKO islets exhibit impaired mitochondrial respiration and lower production of ATP required for GSIS, along with decreased expression of PPARδ target genes involved in mitochondrial oxidation. Furthermore, synthetic PPARδ, but not PPARα, agonist restores GSIS and expression of mitochondrial oxidative genes in βKO mice, revealing that desnutrin-catalyzed lipolysis generates PPARδ ligands. Finally, adenoviral expression of desnutrin in βKO islets restores all defects of βKO islet phenotype and function, including GSIS and mitochondrial defects, demonstrating the critical role of the desnutrin-PPARδ-mitochondrial oxidation axis in regulating islet β cell GSIS.

Abstract: Summary
We identified a mutation in the Diet1 gene in a mouse strain that is resistant to hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Diet1 encodes a 236 kD protein consisting of tandem low-density lipoprotein receptor and MAM (meprin-A5-protein tyrosine phosphatase mu) domains and is expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine. Diet1-deficient mice exhibited an elevated bile acid pool size and impaired feedback regulation of hepatic Cyp7a1, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. In mouse intestine and in cultured human intestinal cells, Diet1 expression levels influenced the production of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19), a hormone that signals from the intestine to liver to regulate Cyp7a1. Transgenic expression of Diet1, or adenoviral-mediated Fgf15 expression, restored normal Cyp7a1 regulation in Diet-1-deficient mice. Diet1 and FGF19 proteins exhibited overlapping subcellular localization in cultured intestinal cells. These results establish Diet1 as a control point in enterohepatic bile acid signaling and lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The regulatory events guiding progenitor activation and differentiation in adult white adipose tissue are largely unknown. We report that induction of brown adipogenesis by β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) activation involves the death of white adipocytes and their removal by M2-polarized macrophages. Recruited macrophages express high levels of osteopontin (OPN), which attracts a subpopulation of PDGFRα+ progenitors expressing CD44, a receptor for OPN. Preadipocyte proliferation is highly targeted to sites of adipocyte clearance and occurs almost exclusively in the PDGFRα+ CD44+ subpopulation. Knockout of OPN prevents formation of crown-like structures by ADRB3 activation and the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of preadipocytes. The recruitment and differentiation of PDGFRα+ progenitors are also observed following physical injury, during matrix-induced neogenesis, and in response to high-fat feeding. Each of these conditions recruits macrophages having a unique polarization signature, which may explain the timing of progenitor activation and the fate of these cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) arise from a defective hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop targeted therapies capable of eliminating the MDS-initiating clones. We identified that IRAK1, an immune-modulating kinase, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in MDSs. MDS clones treated with a small molecule IRAK1 inhibitor (IRAK1/4-Inh) exhibited impaired expansion and increased apoptosis, which coincided with TRAF6/NF-κB inhibition. Suppression of IRAK1, either by RNAi or with IRAK1/4-Inh, is detrimental to MDS cells, while sparing normal CD34+ cells. Based on an integrative gene expression analysis, we combined IRAK1 and BCL2 inhibitors and found that cotreatment more effectively eliminated MDS clones. In summary, these findings implicate IRAK1 as a drugable target in MDSs.

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis through the activation of transcription factors such as XBP1s and ATF6. The functional consequences of these transcription factors for ER proteostasis remain poorly defined. Here, we describe methodology that enables orthogonal, small-molecule-mediated activation of the UPR-associated transcription factors XBP1s and/or ATF6 in the same cell independent of stress. We employ transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics to evaluate ER proteostasis network remodeling owing to the XBP1s and/or ATF6 transcriptional programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three ER proteostasis environments accessible by activating XBP1s and/or ATF6 differentially influence the folding, trafficking, and degradation of destabilized ER client proteins without globally affecting the endogenous proteome. Our data reveal how the ER proteostasis network is remodeled by the XBP1s and/or ATF6 transcriptional programs at the molecular level and demonstrate the potential for selective restoration of aberrant ER proteostasis of pathologic, destabilized proteins through arm-selective UPR activation.

Abstract: Summary
The neurotrophin receptor TrkC was recently identified as a dependence receptor, and, as such, it triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand, NT-3. The molecular mechanism for apoptotic engagement involves the double cleavage of the receptor’s intracellular domain, leading to the formation of a proapoptotic “killer” fragment (TrkC KF). Here, we show that TrkC KF interacts with Cobra1, a putative cofactor of BRCA1, and that Cobra1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We also show that, in the developing chick neural tube, NT-3 silencing is associated with neuroepithelial cell death that is rescued by Cobra1 silencing. Cobra1 shuttles TrkC KF to the mitochondria, where it promotes Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and apoptosome-dependent apoptosis. Thus, we propose that, in the absence of NT-3, the proteolytic cleavage of TrkC leads to the release of a killer fragment that triggers mitochondria-dependent apoptosis via the recruitment of Cobra1.

Abstract: Summary
TGF-β signaling is a therapeutic target in advanced cancers. We identified tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) as a key component mediating pro-oncogenic TGF-β-induced SMAD and non-SMAD signaling. Upon TGF-β stimulation, TRAF4 is recruited to the active TGF-β receptor complex, where it antagonizes E3 ligase SMURF2 and facilitates the recruitment of deubiquitinase USP15 to the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). Both processes contribute to TβRI stabilization on the plasma membrane and thereby enhance TGF-β signaling. In addition, the TGF-β receptor-TRAF4 interaction triggers Lys 63-linked TRAF4 polyubiquitylation and subsequent activation of the TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK)1. TRAF4 is required for efficient TGF-β-induced migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer metastasis. Elevated TRAF4 expression correlated with increased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 and phosphorylated TAK1 as well as poor prognosis among breast cancer patients. Our results demonstrate that TRAF4 can regulate the TGF-β pathway and is a key determinant in breast cancer pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of metabolic homeostasis is a hallmark of aging and is commonly characterized by the deregulation of adaptive signaling interactions that coordinate energy metabolism with dietary changes. The mechanisms driving age-related changes in these adaptive responses remain unclear. Here, we characterize the deregulation of an adaptive metabolic response and the development of metabolic dysfunction in the aging intestine of Drosophila. We find that activation of the insulin-responsive transcription factor Foxo in intestinal enterocytes is required to inhibit the expression of evolutionarily conserved lipases as part of a metabolic response to dietary changes. This adaptive mechanism becomes chronically activated in the aging intestine, mediated by changes in Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Age-related chronic JNK/Foxo activation in enterocytes is deleterious, leading to sustained repression of intestinal lipase expression and the disruption of lipid homeostasis. Changes in the regulation of Foxo-mediated adaptive responses thus contribute to the age-associated breakdown of metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Proteins disabled in Fanconi anemia (FA) are necessary for the maintenance of genome stability during cell proliferation. Upon replication stress signaling by ATR, the FA core complex monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI in order to activate DNA repair. Here, we identified FANCD2 and FANCI in a proteomic screen of replisome-associated factors bound to nascent DNA in response to replication arrest. We found that FANCD2 can interact directly with minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. ATR signaling promoted the transient association of endogenous FANCD2 with the MCM2–MCM7 replicative helicase independently of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. FANCD2 was necessary for human primary cells to restrain DNA synthesis in the presence of a reduced pool of nucleotides and prevented the accumulation of single-stranded DNA, the induction of p21, and the entry of cells into senescence. These data reveal that FANCD2 is an effector of ATR signaling implicated in a general replisome surveillance mechanism that is necessary for sustaining cell proliferation and attenuating carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The specific roles of neuronal subcellular components in behavior and development remain largely unknown, even though advances in molecular biology and conventional whole-cell laser ablation have greatly accelerated the identification of contributors at the molecular and cellular levels. We systematically applied femtosecond laser ablation, which has submicrometer resolution in vivo, to dissect the cell bodies, dendrites, or axons of a sensory neuron (ASJ) in Caenorhabditis elegans to determine their roles in modulating locomotion and the developmental decisions for dauer, a facultative, stress-resistant life stage. Our results indicate that the cell body sends out axonally mediated and hormonal signals in order to mediate these functions. Furthermore, our results suggest that antagonistic sensory dendritic signals primarily drive and switch polarity between the decisions to enter and exit dauer. Thus, the improved resolution of femtosecond laser ablation reveals a rich complexity of neuronal signaling at the subcellular level, including multiple neurite and hormonally mediated pathways dependent on life stage.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydia trachomatis replicates within a membrane-bound compartment termed an inclusion. The inclusion membrane is modified by the insertion of multiple proteins known as Incs. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, an interaction was found between the inclusion membrane protein CT228 and MYPT1, a subunit of myosin phosphatase. MYPT1 was recruited peripherally around the inclusion, whereas the phosphorylated, inactive form was localized to active Src-family kinase-rich microdomains. Phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), myosin IIA, and myosin IIB also colocalized with inactive MYPT1. The role of these proteins was examined in the context of host-cell exit mechanisms (i.e., cell lysis and extrusion of intact inclusions). Inhibition of myosin II or small interfering RNA depletion of myosin IIA, myosin IIB, MLC2, or MLCK reduced chlamydial extrusion, thus favoring lytic events as the primary means of release. These studies provide insights into the regulation of egress mechanisms by C. trachomatis.

Abstract: Summary
Calnexin is a well-characterized transmembrane chaperone involved in the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we reveal a previously unrecognized function of calnexin in regulating the transcriptional response downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF), the product of a well-known human oncogene. We find that cell stimulation with EGF leads to the caspase-8-dependent cleavage of the calnexin cytoplasmic domain, preferentially at ER-mitochondria interaction sites. The released fragment translocates into the nucleus, binds to PIAS3—a natural inhibitor of activated STAT3—and, thus, acts as an enhancer of the STAT3-mediated transcriptional response to EGF. Also, we reveal the unsuspected capacity of calnexin to sense ER stress and, in response, prevent the EGF-induced processing of its cytosolic domain. Thus, cells integrate the health status of the ER to determine the amplitude of their response to EGF.

Abstract: In response to infection, insects produce a variety of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to kill the invading pathogens. To study their physicochemical properties and bioactivities for clinical and commercial use in the porcine industry, we chemically synthesized the mature peptides Bombyx mori moricin and Hyalophora cecropia cecropin B. In this paper, we described the antimicrobial activity of the two AMPs. Moricin exhibited antimicrobial activity on eight strains tested with minimal inhibitory concentration values (MICs) ranging between 8 and 128 μg/ml, while cecropin B mainly showed antimicrobial activity against the Gramnegative strains with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 16 μg/ml. Compared to the potent antimicrobial activity these two AMPs displayed against most of the bacterial pathogens tested, they exhibited limited hemolytic activity against porcine red blood cells. The activities of moricin and cecropin B against Haemophilus parasuis SH 0165 were studied in further detail. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of moricin and cecropin B treated H. parasuis SH 0165 indicated extensive damage to the membranes of the bacteria. Insights into the probable mechanism utilized by moricin and cecropin B to eliminate pathogens are also presented. The observations from this study are important for the future application of AMPs in the porcine industry.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant protein aggregation is a dominant pathological feature in neurodegenerative diseases. Protein aggregates cannot be processed by the proteasome; instead, they are frequently concentrated to the aggresome, a perinuclear inclusion body, and subsequently removed by autophagy. Paradoxically, proteasomes are also concentrated at aggresomes and other related inclusion bodies prevalent in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we show that proteasomes are crucial components in aggresome clearance. The disassembly and disposal of aggresomes requires Poh1, a proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitinated proteins and releases ubiquitin chains. In Poh1-deficient cells, aggresome clearance is blocked. Remarkably, microinjection of free lysine (K) 63-linked ubiquitin chains restores aggresome degradation. We present evidence that free ubiquitin chains produced by Poh1 bind and activate the deacetylase HDAC6, which, in turn, stimulates actinomyosin- and autophagy-dependent aggresome processing. Thus, unanchored ubiquitin chains are key signaling molecules that connect and coordinate the proteasome and autophagy to eliminate toxic protein aggregates.

Abstract: Summary
The histone H2A-H2B heterodimer is an integral component of the nucleosome. The cellular localization and deposition of H2A-H2B into chromatin is regulated by numerous factors, including histone chaperones such as nucleosome assembly protein 1 (Nap1). We use hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize H2A-H2B and Nap1. Unexpectedly, we find that at low ionic strength, the α helices in H2A-H2B are frequently sampling partially disordered conformations and that binding to Nap1 reduces this conformational sampling. We identify the interaction surface between H2A-H2B and Nap1 and confirm its relevance both in vitro and in vivo. We show that two copies of H2A-H2B bound to a Nap1 homodimer form a tetramer with contacts between H2B chains similar to those in the four-helix bundle structural motif. The organization of the complex reveals that Nap1 competes with histone-DNA and interhistone interactions observed in the nucleosome, thereby regulating the availability of histones for chromatin assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Our knowledge of the destructive events that regulate axonal degeneration is rudimentary. Here, we examine the role of caspases and their endogenous inhibitor, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), in axonal degeneration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons. We show that caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-9 are present in axons and are cleaved upon nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal. We observed that caspase-3 activity is high in NGF-withdrawn axons and that CASP3−/− axons are protected from degeneration. XIAP−/− DRG sensory neurons degenerate more rapidly and contain more active caspase-3 than their wild-type counterparts, indicating that axonal caspases are normally regulated by XIAP. Importantly, axonal XIAP levels drop sharply after NGF withdrawal; if XIAP levels are maintained by overexpression, axonal caspase-3 activation and axonal degeneration are suppressed. Finally, we show that XIAP−/− embryos have stunted dermal innervation. We propose that XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition plays an important role in regulating morphogenic events that shape the nervous system during development.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid metabolism is tightly controlled by the nutritional state of the organism. Nutrient-rich conditions increase lipogenesis, whereas nutrient deprivation promotes fat oxidation. In this study, we identify the mitochondrial sirtuin, SIRT4, as a regulator of lipid homeostasis. SIRT4 is active in nutrient-replete conditions to repress fatty acid oxidation while promoting lipid anabolism. SIRT4 deacetylates and inhibits malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD), an enzyme that produces acetyl CoA from malonyl CoA. Malonyl CoA provides the carbon skeleton for lipogenesis and also inhibits fat oxidation. Mice lacking SIRT4 display elevated MCD activity and decreased malonyl CoA in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue. Consequently, SIRT4 KO mice display deregulated lipid metabolism, leading to increased exercise tolerance and protection against diet-induced obesity. In sum, this work elucidates SIRT4 as an important regulator of lipid homeostasis, identifies MCD as a SIRT4 target, and deepens our understanding of the malonyl CoA regulatory axis.

Abstract: Summary
RAP1 is part of shelterin, the protective complex at telomeres. RAP1 also binds along chromosome arms, where it is proposed to regulate gene expression. To investigate the nontelomeric roles of RAP1 in vivo, we generated a RAP1 whole-body knockout mouse. These mice show early onset of obesity, which is more severe in females than in males. Rap1-deficient mice show accumulation of abdominal fat, hepatic steatosis, and high-fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase. Gene expression analyses of liver and visceral white fat from Rap1-deficient mice before the onset of obesity show deregulation of metabolic programs, including fatty acid, glucose metabolism, and PPARα signaling. We identify Pparα and Pgc1α as key factors affected by Rap1 deletion in the liver. We show that RAP1 binds to Pparα and Pgc1α loci and modulates their transcription. These findings reveal a role for a telomere-binding protein in the regulation of metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that function in photomorphogenesis of plants. Photoisomerization of phytochrome by red light leads to its translocation to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression. We examined whether phytochrome is phosphorylated in response to light, and we report that phytochrome B (phyB)’s N terminus contains a region with a number of phosphoserines, threonines, and tyrosines. The light-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 104 (Y104) appears to play a negative role in phyB’s activity, because a phosphomimic mutant, phyBY104E, is unable to complement any phyB-related phenotype, is defective in binding to its signaling partner PIF3, and fails to form stable nuclear bodies even though it retains normal photochemistry in vitro. In contrast, plants stably expressing a nonphosphorylatable mutant, phyBY104F, are hypersensitive to light. The proper response to changes in the light environment is crucial for plant survival, and our study brings tyrosine phosphorylation to the forefront of light-signaling mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction is linked to the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including heart failure, but the specific mechanisms for this link remain largely elusive. We modeled the impairment of mitochondrial respiration by the inactivation of the Ndufs4 gene, a protein critical for complex I assembly, in the mouse heart (cKO). Although complex I-supported respiration decreased by >40%, the cKO mice maintained normal cardiac function in vivo and high-energy phosphate content in isolated perfused hearts. However, the cKO mice developed accelerated heart failure after pressure overload or repeated pregnancy. Decreased NAD+/NADH ratio by complex I deficiency inhibited Sirt3 activity, leading to an increase in protein acetylation and sensitization of the permeability transition in mitochondria (mPTP). NAD+ precursor supplementation to cKO mice partially normalized the NAD+/NADH ratio, protein acetylation, and mPTP sensitivity. These findings describe a mechanism connecting mitochondrial dysfunction to the susceptibility to diseases and propose a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
LEM domain (LEM-D) proteins are components of an extensive protein network that assembles beneath the inner nuclear envelope. Defects in LEM-D proteins cause tissue-restricted human diseases associated with altered stem cell homeostasis. Otefin (Ote) is a Drosophila LEM-D protein that is intrinsically required for female germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance. Previous studies linked Ote loss with transcriptional activation of the key differentiation gene bag-of-marbles (bam), leading to the model in which Ote tethers the bam gene to the nuclear periphery for gene silencing. Using genetic and phenotypic analyses of multiple ote−/− backgrounds, we obtained evidence that is inconsistent with this model. We show that bam repression is maintained in ote−/− GSCs and that germ cell loss persists in ote−/−, bam−/− mutants, together demonstrating that GSC loss is independent of bam transcription. We show that the primary defect in ote−/− GSCs is a block of differentiation, which ultimately leads to germ cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are believed to regulate gene transcription by catalyzing deacetylation reactions. HDAC3 depletion in mouse liver upregulates lipogenic genes and results in severe hepatosteatosis. Here we show that pharmacologic HDAC inhibition in primary hepatocytes causes histone hyperacetylation but does not upregulate expression of HDAC3 target genes. Meanwhile, deacetylase-dead HDAC3 mutants can rescue hepatosteatosis and repress lipogenic genes expression in HDAC3-depleted mouse liver, demonstrating that histone acetylation is insufficient to activate gene transcription. Mutations abolishing interactions with the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR or SMRT) render HDAC3 nonfunctional in vivo. Additionally, liver-specific knockout of NCOR, but not SMRT, causes metabolic and transcriptomal alterations resembling those of mice without hepatic HDAC3, demonstrating that interaction with NCOR is essential for deacetylase-independent function of HDAC3. These findings highlight nonenzymatic roles of a major HDAC in transcriptional regulation in vivo and warrant reconsideration of the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors.

Abstract: It has been suggested that activation of receptor PTKs is important for leukemogenesis and leukemia cell response to targeted therapy in hematological malignancies including leukemia. PTKs induce activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which can result in prevention of apoptosis. Here, we describe an important role of the TrkC-associated molecular network in the process of leukemogenesis. TrkC was found to be frequently overexpressed in human leukemia cells and leukemia subtypes. In U937 human leukemia cells, blockade of TrkC using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific to TrkC or K562a, a specific inhibitor of TrkC, resulted in a significant decrease in growth and survival of the cells, which was closely associated with reduced mTOR level and Akt activity. In addition, TrkC enhances the survival and proliferation of leukemia, which is correlated with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, TrkC significantly inhibits apoptosis via induction of the expression of PLK-1 and Twist-1 through activation of AKT/mTor pathway; therefore, it plays a key role in leuke- mogenesis. These findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for TrkC in the pathogenesis of leukemia and have important implications for understanding various hematological malignancies.

Abstract: In this study we used barium currents through voltage gated L-type calcium channels (recorded in freshly isolated cells with a conventional patch-clamp technique) to elucidate the cellular action mechanism for volatile anesthetics. It was found that halothane and isoflurane inhibited (dose-dependently and voltage independently) Ba2+ currents through voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Half maximal inhibitions occurred at 0.64±0.07mM and 0.86±0.1mM. The Hill slope value was 2 for both volatile anesthetics, suggesting the presence of more than one interaction site. Current inhibition by volatile anesthetics was prominent over the whole voltage range without changes in the peak of the current voltage relationship. Intracellular infusion of the GDPβS (100μM) together with staurosporine (200nM) did not prevent the inhibitory effect of volatile anesthetics. Unlike pharmacological Ca2+ channel blockers, volatile anesthetics blocked Ca2+ channel currents at resting membrane potentials. In other words, halothane and isoflurane induced an ‘initial block’. After the first 4–7 control pulses, the cells were left unstimulated and anesthetics were applied. The first depolarization after the pause evoked a Ca2+ channel current whose amplitude was reduced to 41±3.4% and to 57±4.2% of control values. In an analysis of the steady-state inactivation curve for voltage dependence, volatile anesthetics induced a negative shift of the 50% inactivation of the calcium channels. By contrast, the steepness factor characterizing the voltage sensitivity of the channels was unaffected. Unitary L-type Ca2+ channels blockade occurred under cell-attached configuration, suggesting a possible action of volatile anesthetics from within the intracellular space or from the part of the channel inside the lipid bilayer.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of microbial or self DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells is a danger signal detected by the DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which catalyzes the production of cGAMP that in turn serves as a second messenger to activate innate immune responses. Here we show that endogenous cGAMP in mammalian cells contains two distinct phosphodiester linkages, one between 2′-OH of GMP and 5′-phosphate of AMP, and the other between 3′-OH of AMP and 5′-phosphate of GMP. This molecule, termed 2′3′-cGAMP, is unique in that it binds to the adaptor protein STING with a much greater affinity than cGAMP molecules containing other combinations of phosphodiester linkages. The crystal structure of STING bound to 2′3′-cGAMP revealed the structural basis of this high-affinity binding and a ligand-induced conformational change in STING that may underlie its activation.

Abstract: Summary
Many fundamental aspects of DNA replication, such as the exact locations where DNA synthesis is initiated and terminated, how frequently origins are used, and how fork progression is influenced by transcription, are poorly understood. Via the deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments, we comprehensively document replication fork directionality throughout the S. cerevisiae genome, which permits the systematic analysis of initiation, origin efficiency, fork progression, and termination. We show that leading-strand initiation preferentially occurs within a nucleosome-free region at replication origins. Using a strain in which late origins can be induced to fire early, we show that replication termination is a largely passive phenomenon that does not rely on cis-acting sequences or replication fork pausing. The replication profile is predominantly determined by the kinetics of origin firing, allowing us to reconstruct chromosome-wide timing profiles from an asynchronous culture.

Abstract: An atypical orphan response regulator protein, HP1043 (HP-RR) in Helicobacter pylori, is proven to be essential for cell growth and does not require the well known phosphorelay scheme. HP-RR was identified as a symmetric dimer with two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain (HP-RRr) and a C-terminal effector domain (HP-RRe). HP-RR is a new class of response regulator, as a phosphorylation-independent regulator. Previously, we have presented a detailed three-dimensional structure of HP-RR using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. In this study, in order to understand the functional importance of flexibilities in HP-RRr and HP-RRe, T1, T2, heteronuclear NOE experiments have been performed and backbone dynamics of HP-RRr and HP-RRe were investigated. HPRRr is a symmetric dimer and the interface region, α4-β5-α5 of dimer, showed high rigidity (high S2 values). Site of rearrangements associated with phosphorylation of HPRRr (Ser75: Rex = 3.382, Ile95: Rex = 5.228) showed slow chemical exchanges. HP-RRe is composed of three α-helices flanked on two sides by anti-parallel β-sheets. Low order parameters as well as conformational exchanges in the centers of loop regions known as the DNA binding site and transcription site of HP-RRe suggested that flexibility of HP-RRe is essential for interaction with DNA. In conclusion, backbone dynamics information for HP-RR implies that structural flexibilities in HP-RRr are necessary for the phosphorylation site and the dynamic nature of HP-RRe is essential for the regulation of interaction between protein and DNA.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase MITOL regulates mitochondrial dynamics. We report here that MITOL regulates mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) domain formation through mitofusin2 (Mfn2). MITOL interacts with and ubiquitinates mitochondrial Mfn2, but not ER-associated Mfn2. Mutation analysis identified a specific interaction between MITOL C-terminal domain and Mfn2 HR1 domain. MITOL mediated lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chain addition to Mfn2, but not its proteasomal degradation. MITOL knockdown inhibited Mfn2 complex formation and caused Mfn2 mislocalization and MAM dysfunction. Sucrose-density gradient centrifugation and blue native PAGE retardation assay demonstrated that MITOL is required for GTP-dependent Mfn2 oligomerization. MITOL knockdown reduced Mfn2 GTP binding, resulting in reduced GTP hydrolysis. We identified K192 in the GTPase domain of Mfn2 as a major ubiquitination site for MITOL. A K192R mutation blocked oligomerization even in the presence of GTP. Taken together, these results suggested that MITOL regulates ER tethering to mitochondria by activating Mfn2 via K192 ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Synapse formation is a complex process that involves the recruitment and assembly of a myriad of pre- and postsynaptic proteins. Despite being present at every synapse in the vertebrate CNS, little is known about the transport, recruitment, and stabilization of synapsin at nascent synapses during development. We examined the transport and recruitment of synapsin to nascent presynaptic terminals in vivo in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. Synapsin was transported in a transport packet independently of two other presynaptic organelles: synaptic vesicle (SV) protein transport vesicles (STVs) and Piccolo-containing active zone precursor transport vesicles (PTVs). During presynaptic assembly, recruitment of all three transport packets occurred in an ordered sequence: STVs preceded PTVs, which in turn preceded synapsin. Importantly, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) specifically regulated the late recruitment of synapsin transport packets at synapses. These results point to additional layers of complexity in the established mechanisms of synaptogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
During ribosome recycling, posttermination complexes are dissociated by ABCE1 and eRF1 into 60S and tRNA/mRNA-associated 40S subunits, after which tRNA and mRNA are released by eIF1/eIF1A, Ligatin, or MCT-1/DENR. Occasionally, 40S subunits remain associated with mRNA and reinitiate at nearby AUGs. We recapitulated reinitiation using a reconstituted mammalian translation system. The presence of eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and Met-tRNAiMet was sufficient for recycled 40S subunits to remain on mRNA, scan bidirectionally, and reinitiate at upstream and downstream AUGs if mRNA regions flanking the stop codon were unstructured. Imposition of 3′ directionality additionally required eIF4F. Strikingly, posttermination ribosomes were not stably anchored on mRNA and migrated bidirectionally to codons cognate to the P site tRNA. Migration depended on the mode of peptide release (puromycin > eRF1⋅eRF3) and nature of tRNA and was enhanced by eEF2. The mobility of posttermination ribosomes suggests that some reinitiation events could involve 80S ribosomes rather than 40S subunits.

Abstract: Co-expression of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) has never been examined in ovary (OV) and umbilical cord (UC) of the European bison (Eb), the endangered wild species. The OV and UC samples were harvested from seasonally eliminated Eb females (45–120 days post coitum). Frozen histological sections were examined by double fluorescent immunohistochemistry (dF-IHC), using the primary mouse anti-DβH monoclonals and rabbit anti-NPY polyclonals and then the immunocomplexes were visualized with FITC and CY3 fluorophores, respectively. Numerous DβH immunoreactive nerve fibers (DβH-IRs) and a little less frequent NPY-IRs were found in the bundle-like structures, innervating mainly perivascular regions of the OV. The NPY-IRs constantly co-expressed DβH, while some DβH-IRs did not express NPY. This specific pattern of innervation was observed both in the stromal and cortical regions of the OV. The simultaneous co-expression of DβH and NPY were also detected in the UC, in which specific single or bundle-like structures ran along the smooth muscles of blood vessels. The spatial-specific co-expression of DβH and NPY in OV and UC, may suggest that these markers are involved in the control of vascularization that regulates nourishing blood circulation required for proper pregnancy maintenance and efficient embryo/fetus development in the Eb.

Abstract: Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) initiates a signaling cascade that leads to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, but its role in regulating DNA replication licensing is unclear. Here, we show that activated EGFR phosphorylates the p56 isoform of Lyn, p56Lyn, at Y32, which then phosphorylates MCM7, a licensing factor critical for DNA replication, at Y600 to increase its association with other minichromosome maintenance complex proteins, thereby promoting DNA synthesis complex assembly and cell proliferation. Both p56Lyn Y32 and MCM7 Y600 phosphorylation are enhanced in proliferating cells and correlated with poor survival of breast cancer patients. These results establish a signaling cascade in which EGFR enhances MCM7 phosphorylation and DNA replication through Lyn phosphorylation in human cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and further metabolized by the gut microbiota into secondary bile acids. Bile acid synthesis is under negative feedback control through activation of the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the ileum and liver. Here we profiled the bile acid composition throughout the enterohepatic system in germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. We confirmed a dramatic reduction in muricholic acid, but not cholic acid, levels in CONV-R mice. Rederivation of Fxr-deficient mice as GF demonstrated that the gut microbiota regulated expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 in the ileum and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver by FXR-dependent mechanisms. Importantly, we identified tauro-conjugated beta- and alpha-muricholic acids as FXR antagonists. These studies suggest that the gut microbiota not only regulates secondary bile acid metabolism but also inhibits bile acid synthesis in the liver by alleviating FXR inhibition in the ileum.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic shape changes of the plasma membrane are fundamental to many processes, ranging from morphogenesis and cell migration to phagocytosis and viral propagation. Here, we demonstrate that Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, induces tubular membrane invaginations toward the lumen of synthetic vesicles in vitro and generates protrusions on the surface of cells. Biochemical analyses using Exo70 mutants and independent molecular dynamics simulations based on Exo70 structure demonstrate that Exo70 generates negative membrane curvature through an oligomerization-based mechanism. In cells, the membrane-deformation function of Exo70 is required for protrusion formation and directional cell migration. Exo70 thus represents a membrane-bending protein that may couple actin dynamics and plasma membrane remodeling for morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, calcium influx is required for oocyte maturation and egg activation. The molecular identities of the calcium-permeant channels that underlie the initiation of embryonic development are not established. Here, we describe a transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel current activated by TRP agonists that is absent in TrpV3−/− eggs. TRPV3 current is differentially expressed during oocyte maturation, reaching a peak of maximum density and activity at metaphase of meiosis II (MII), the stage of fertilization. Selective activation of TRPV3 channels provokes egg activation by mediating massive calcium entry. Widely used to activate eggs, strontium application is known to yield normal offspring in combination with somatic cell nuclear transfer. We show that TRPV3 is required for strontium influx, because TrpV3−/− eggs failed to conduct Sr2+ or undergo strontium-induced activation. We propose that TRPV3 is a major mediator of calcium influx in mouse eggs and is a putative target for artificial egg activation.

Abstract: Summary
Death Inducer Obliterator 3 (Dido3) is implicated in the maintenance of stem cell genomic stability and tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Dido3 regulates the expression of stemness genes in embryonic stem cells through its plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. Binding of Dido3 PHD to histone H3K4me3 is disrupted by threonine phosphorylation that triggers Dido3 translocation from chromatin to the mitotic spindle. The crystal structure of Dido3 PHD in complex with H3K4me3 reveals an atypical aromatic-cage-like binding site that contains a histidine residue. Biochemical, structural, and mutational analyses of the binding mechanism identified the determinants of specificity and affinity and explained the inability of homologous PHF3 to bind H3K4me3. Together, our findings reveal a link between the transcriptional control in embryonic development and regulation of cell division.

Abstract: Summary
As the cellular power plant, mitochondria play a significant role in homeostasis. To maintain the proper quality and quantity of mitochondria requires both mitochondrial degradation and division. A selective type of autophagy, mitophagy, drives the degradation of excess or damaged mitochondria, whereas division is controlled by a specific fission complex; however, the relationship between these two processes, especially the role of mitochondrial fission during mitophagy, remains unclear. In this study, we report that mitochondrial fission is important for the progression of mitophagy. When mitophagy is induced, the fission complex is recruited to the degrading mitochondria through an interaction between Atg11 and Dnm1; interfering with this interaction severely blocks mitophagy. These data establish a paradigm for selective organelle degradation.

Abstract: Summary
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are typically present in a basal, inactive state but, when bound to an agonist, activate downstream signaling cascades. In studying arrestin regulation of opioid receptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we find that agonists of delta opioid receptors (δORs) activate cofilin through Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), LIM domain kinase (LIMK), and β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) to regulate actin polymerization. This controls receptor function, as assessed by agonist-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in DRGs. Agonists of opioid-receptor-like receptors (ORL1) similarly influence the function of this receptor through ROCK, LIMK, and β-arr1. Functional evidence of this cascade was demonstrated in vivo, where the behavioral effects of δOR or ORL1 agonists were enhanced in the absence of β-arr1 or prevented by inhibiting ROCK. This pathway allows δOR and ORL1 agonists to rapidly regulate receptor function.

Abstract: Lipid rafts are related to cell surface receptor function. Integrin is a major surface receptor protein in cell adhesion and migration on the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we showed that lipid rafts played a critical role in human melanoma A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin; an important component of the ECM that interacts with β1 integrin. We found that the disruption of lipid rafts did not markedly inhibit the expression and activation of β1 integrin. By coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we investigated the influence of lipid rafts on the β1 integrin complex and identified nucleolin as a potential lipid-raft-dependent β1-integrin-interacting protein. Upon confirmation of the interaction between β1 integrin and nucleolin, further studies revealed that nucleolin colocalized with β1 integrin in lipid rafts and raft disruption interrupted their association. In addition, knockdown of nucleolin markedly attenuated A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin. Taken together, we demonstrated that nucleolin is a critical lipid-raft-dependent β1-integrin-interacting protein in A375 cell spreading and migration on fibronectin.

Abstract: Oxidative stress promotes damage to cellular proteins, lipids, membranes and DNA, and plays a key role in the development of cancer. Reactive oxygen species disrupt redox homeostasis and promote tumor formation by initiating aberrant activation of signaling pathways that lead to tumorigenesis. We used shotgun proteomics to identify proteins containing oxidation-sensitive cysteines in tissue specimens from colorectal cancer patients. We then compared the patterns of cysteine oxidation in the membrane fractions between the tumor and non-tumor tissues. Using nano-UPLC-MSE proteomics, we identified 31 proteins containing 37 oxidation-sensitive cysteines. These proteins were observed with IAM-binding cysteines in non-tumoral region more than tumoral region of CRC patients. Then using the Ingenuity pathway program, we evaluated the cellular canonical networks connecting those proteins. Within the networks, proteins with multiple connections were related with organ morphology, cellular metabolism, and various disorders. We have thus identified networks of proteins whose redox status is altered by oxidative stress, perhaps leading to changes in cellular functionality that promotes tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) with distinct FGF ligands generates specific cellular responses. However, the mechanisms underlying this paradigm have remained elusive. Here, we show that FGF-7 stimulation leads to FGFR2b degradation and, ultimately, cell proliferation, whereas FGF-10 promotes receptor recycling and cell migration. By combining mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics with fluorescence microscopy and biochemical methods, we find that FGF-10 specifically induces the rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y) 734 on FGFR2b, which leads to PI3K and SH3BP4 recruitment. This complex is crucial for FGFR2b recycling and responses, given that FGF-10 stimulation of either FGFR2b_Y734F mutant- or SH3BP4-depleted cells switches the receptor endocytic route to degradation, resulting in decreased breast cancer cell migration and the inhibition of epithelial branching in mouse lung explants. Altogether, these results identify an intriguing ligand-dependent mechanism for the control of receptor fate and cellular outputs that may explain the pathogenic role of deregulated FGFR2b, thus offering therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: Neural epidermal growth factor-like protein-like 2 (NELL2) is a secreted glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, but little is known about the intracellular movement and secretion mechanism of this protein. By monitoring the localization and movements of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled NELL2 in living cultured hippocampal neuroprogenitor HiB5 cells, we determined the subcellular localization of NELL2 and its intracellular movement and secretion mechanism. Cterminal EGFP-fused NELL2 showed a typical expression pattern of secreted proteins, especially with respect to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and punctate structures. Vesicles containing NELL2 exhibited bidirectional movement in HiB5 cells. The majority of the vesicles (70.1%) moved in an anterograde direction with an average velocity of 0.454 µm/s, whereas some vesicles (28.7%) showed retrograde movement with an average velocity of 0.302 µm/s. The movement patterns of NELL2 vesicles were dependent upon the presence of microtubules in HiB5 cells. Anterograde movement of NELL2 did not lead to a detectable accumulation of NELL2 in the peripheral region of the cell, indicating that it was secreted into the culture medium. We also showed that the N-terminal 29 amino acids of NELL2 were important for secretion of this protein. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the N-terminal region of NELL2 determines both the pattern of its intracellular expression and transport of NELL2 vesicles by high-velocity movement. Therefore, NELL2 may affect the cellular activity of cells in a paracrine or autocrine manner.

Abstract: Summary
Prions are propagated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with remarkable efficiency, yet we know little about the structural basis of sequence variations in the prion protein that support or prohibit propagation of the prion conformation. We show that certain single-amino-acid substitutions in the prion protein Sup35 impact negatively on the maintenance of the associated prion-based [PSI+] trait by combining in vivo phenotypic analysis with solution NMR structural studies. A clear correlation is observed between mutationally induced conformational differences in one of the oligopeptide repeats (R2) in the N terminus of Sup35 and the relative ability to propagate [PSI+]. Strikingly, substitution of one of a Gly-Gly pair with highly charged residues that significantly increase structural definition of R2 lead to a severe [PSI+] propagation defect. These findings offer a molecular explanation for the dominant-negative effects of such psi-no-more (PNM) mutations and demonstrate directly the importance of localized structural definition in prion propagation.

Abstract: Summary
We created a site-directed UAS-ORF library of 655 growth-regulating genes in Drosophila. This library represents a large collection of genes regulating cell cycle, cell size, and proliferation and will be a valuable resource for studying growth regulation in vivo. By using misexpression of genes, we prevent problems arising from genetic redundancy and can uncover novel gene functions. To validate the usefulness of this library, we screened for Wingless (Wg) pathway components. We used a combination of experimental and bioinformatic approaches to predict candidates and identified three serine/threonine kinases as regulators of Wg signaling. We show that one of these, Nek2, optimizes pathway response by direct phosphorylation of Dishevelled. In addition, we describe functional relations for roughly 5% of all Drosophila genes and identify a large number of genes that regulate cell size, proliferation, and final organ size upon misexpression.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation upon interferon-γ (IFNγ) stimulation, which results in the expression of genes with antiproliferative and immunomodulatory functions. The inactivation of STAT1 occurs through tyrosine dephosphorylation by the tyrosine phosphatase TC45. It was proposed that recruitment of TC45 required the direct interaction of STAT1 with the scaffold protein β-arrestin1, making β-arrestin1 an essential negative regulator of STAT1 and IFNγ signaling (Mo et al., 2008). We tested the relevance of β-arrestin1 for STAT1 activity. Our results do not confirm β-arrestin1 as a STAT1-interacting protein. The STAT1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle was found to be unaffected by both the overexpression and the genetic deletion of β-arrestin1. Accordingly, β-arrestin1 did not inhibit STAT1 transcriptional activity or the induction of IFNγ target genes in response to IFNγ. Our data indicate that β-arrestin1 is dispensable for STAT1 dephosphorylation and the termination of IFNγ signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Transitions between pluripotent and differentiated states are marked by dramatic epigenetic changes. Cellular differentiation is tightly linked to X chromosome inactivation (XCI), whereas reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is associated with X chromosome reactivation (XCR). XCR reverses the silent state of the inactive X, occurring in mouse blastocysts and germ cells. In spite of its importance, little is known about underlying mechanisms. Here, we examine the role of the long noncoding Tsix RNA and the germline factor, PRDM14. In blastocysts, XCR is perturbed by mutation of either Tsix or Prdm14. In iPSCs, XCR is disrupted only by PRDM14 deficiency, which also affects iPSC derivation and maintenance. We show that Tsix and PRDM14 directly link XCR to pluripotency: first, PRDM14 represses Rnf12 by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2; second, Tsix enables PRDM14 to bind Xist. Thus, our study provides functional and mechanistic links between cellular and X chromosome reprogramming.

Abstract: Demyelination is the pathological process by which myelin sheaths are lost from around axons, and is usually caused by a direct insult targeted at the oligodendrocytes in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). A demyelinated CNS is usually remyelinated by a population of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are widely distributed throughout the adult CNS. However, myelin disruption and remyelination failure affect the normal function of the nervous system, causing human diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In spite of numerous studies aimed at understanding the remyelination process, many questions still remain unanswered. Therefore, to study remyelination mechanisms in vivo, a demyelination animal model was generated using a transgenic zebrafish system in which oligodendrocytes are conditionally ablated in the larval and adult CNS. In this transgenic system, bacterial nitroreductase enzyme (NTR), which converts the prodrug metronidazole (Mtz) into a cytotoxic DNA cross-linking agent, is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells under the control of the mbp and so×10 promoter. Exposure of transgenic zebrafish to Mtz-containing media resulted in rapid ablation of oligodendrocytes and CNS demyelination within 48 h, but removal of Mtz medium led to efficient remyelination of the demyelinated CNS within 7 days. In addition, the demyelination and remyelination processes could be easily observed in living transgenic zebrafish by detecting the fluorescent protein, mCherry, indicating that this transgenic system can be used as a valuable animal model to study the remyelination process in vivo, and to conduct high-throughput primary screens for new drugs that facilitate remyelination.

Abstract: Summary
Biological networks consist of a defined set of regulatory motifs. Subcellular compartmentalization of regulatory molecules can provide a further dimension in implementing regulatory motifs. However, spatial regulatory motifs and their roles in biological networks have rarely been explored. Here we show, using experimentation and mathematical modeling, that spatial segregation of GIGANTEA (GI), a critical component of plant circadian systems, into nuclear and cytosolic compartments leads to differential functions as positive and negative regulators of the circadian core gene, LHY, forming an incoherent feedforward loop to regulate LHY. This regulatory motif formed by nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of GI confers, through the balanced operation of the nuclear and cytosolic GI, strong rhythmicity and robustness to external and internal noises to the circadian system. Our results show that spatial and functional segregation of a single molecule species into different cellular compartments provides a means for extending the regulatory capabilities of biological networks.

Abstract: Summary
ID genes are required for breast cancer colonization of the lungs, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Id1 expression induces a stem-like phenotype in breast cancer cells while retaining epithelial properties, contrary to the notion that cancer stem-like properties are inextricably linked to the mesenchymal state. During metastatic colonization, Id1 induces a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), specifically in cells whose mesenchymal state is dependent on the Id1 target protein Twist1, but not at the primary site, where this state is controlled by the zinc finger protein Snail1. Knockdown of Id expression in metastasizing cells prevents MET and dramatically reduces lung colonization. Furthermore, Id1 is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β only in cells that have first undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), demonstrating that EMT is a prerequisite for subsequent Id1-induced MET during lung colonization. Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of Id-mediated phenotypic switching during distinct stages of breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract: The Mesometridae includes only five genera and eight species. The available data on the ultrastructure of sperm cells of mesometrid species referred to two species only, Elstia stossichianum and Wardula capitellata. The present study revealed the ultrastructure of the spermatozoon of a third genus and third species of Mesometridae, Centroderma spinosissima. The mature spermatozoon of C. spinosissima presents two axonemes with different lengths of the Ehlers’ 9+‘1’ trepaxonematan pattern, a nucleus, two mitochondria, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules, external ornamentation of the plasma membrane, a lateral expansion, spine-like bodies, cytoplasmic ornamented buttons and granules of glycogen. The spermatozoon of C. spinosissima is similar to those of the previously studied mesometrids. However, some peculiarities such as the presence of two mitochondria, the disposition of the external ornamentation of the plasma membrane and the morphology of the posterior spermatozoon extremity, characterize the male gamete of C. spinosissima. Moreover, the presence of cytoplasmic ornamented buttons is a characteristic found only in the mature spermatozoon of mesometrids and it probably represents an autapomorphy for this family.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial disulfide relay system of Mia40 and Erv1/ALR facilitates import of the small translocase of the inner membrane (Tim) proteins and cysteine-rich proteins. A chemical screen identified small molecules that inhibit Erv1 oxidase activity, thereby facilitating dissection of the disulfide relay system in yeast and vertebrate mitochondria. One molecule, mitochondrial protein import blockers from the Carla Koehler laboratory (MitoBloCK-6), attenuated the import of Erv1 substrates into yeast mitochondria and inhibited oxidation of Tim13 and Cmc1 in in vitro reconstitution assays. In addition, MitoBloCK-6 revealed an unexpected role for Erv1 in the carrier import pathway, namely transferring substrates from the translocase of the outer membrane complex onto the small Tim complexes. Cardiac development was impaired in MitoBloCK-6-exposed zebrafish embryos. Finally, MitoBloCK-6 induced apoptosis via cytochrome c release in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) but not in differentiated cells, suggesting an important role for ALR in hESC homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The recent surge in obesity has provided an impetus to better understand the mechanisms of adipogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT) because of its potential utilization for antiobesity therapy. Postnatal brown adipocytes arise from early muscle progenitors, but how brown fat lineage is determined is not completely understood. Here, we show that a multifunctional protein, Ewing Sarcoma (EWS), is essential for determining brown fat lineage during development. BATs from Ews null embryos and newborns are developmentally arrested. Ews mutant brown preadipocytes fail to differentiate due to loss of Bmp7 expression, a critical early brown adipogenic factor. We demonstrate that EWS, along with its binding partner Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), activates Bmp7 transcription. Depletion of either Ews or Ybx1 leads to loss of Bmp7 expression and brown adipogenesis. Remarkably, Ews null BATs and brown preadipocytes ectopically express myogenic genes. These results demonstrate that EWS is essential for early brown fat lineage determination.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) is a critical regulator of energy metabolism in the heart. Here, we propose a mechanism that integrates two deleterious characteristics of heart failure, hypoxia and a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, involving the microRNA cluster miR-199a∼214 and PPARδ. We demonstrate that under hemodynamic stress, cardiac hypoxia activates DNM3os, a noncoding transcript that harbors the microRNA cluster miR-199a∼214, which shares PPARδ as common target. To address the significance of miR-199a∼214 induction and concomitant PPARδ repression, we performed antagomir-based silencing of both microRNAs and subjected mice to biomechanical stress to induce heart failure. Remarkably, antagomir-treated animals displayed improved cardiac function and restored mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanism whereby miR-199a∼214 actively represses cardiac PPARδ expression, facilitating a metabolic shift from predominant reliance on fatty acid utilization in the healthy myocardium toward increased reliance on glucose metabolism at the onset of heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the active positioning of transcripts outside of embryogenesis or highly polarized cells. We show here that a specific G1 cyclin transcript is highly clustered in the cytoplasm of large multinucleate cells. This heterogeneous cyclin transcript localization results from aggregation of an RNA-binding protein, and deletion of a polyglutamine stretch in this protein results in random transcript localization. These multinucleate cells are remarkable in that nuclei cycle asynchronously despite sharing a common cytoplasm. Notably, randomization of cyclin transcript localization significantly diminishes nucleus-to-nucleus differences in the number of mRNAs and synchronizes cell-cycle timing. Thus, nonrandom cyclin transcript localization is important for cell-cycle timing control and arises due to polyQ-dependent behavior of an RNA-binding protein. There is a widespread association between polyQ expansions and RNA-binding motifs, suggesting that this is a broadly exploited mechanism to produce spatially variable transcripts and heterogeneous cell behaviors.

Regulation of store-operated calcium entry by FK506-binding immunophilins,

Abstract: Calcium entry from the extracellular space into cells is an important signaling mechanism in both physiological and pathophysiological functions. In non-excitable cells, store-operated calcium (SOC) entry represents a principal mode of calcium entry. Activation of SOC entry in pulmonary artery endothelial cells leads to the formation of inter-endothelial cell gaps and subsequent endothelial barrier disruption. Regulation of endothelial SOC entry is poorly understood. In this work, we identify two large molecular weight immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, as novel regulators of SOC entry in endothelial cells. Using cell fractionation studies and immunocytochemistry we determined that a fraction of these largely cytosolic proteins localize to the plasma membrane where SOC entry channels are found. That FKBP51 and FKBP52 associate with SOC entry channel protein complexes was supported by co-precipitation of the immunophilins with TRPC4, a subunit of the calcium-selective, SOC entry channel ISOC. Dexamethasone-induced upregulation of FKBP51 expression in pulmonary artery endothelial cells reduced global SOC entry as well as ISOC. Similar results were observed when FKBP51 was over-expressed in an inducible HEK293 cell line. On the other hand, when FKBP52 was over-expressed SOC entry was enhanced. When expression of FKBP52 was inhibited, SOC entry was decreased. Collectively, our observations support regulatory roles for these large molecular weight immunophilins in which FKBP51 inhibits, whereas FKBP52 enhances, SOC entry in endothelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
The NCI-60 cell line collection is a very widely used panel for the study of cellular mechanisms of cancer in general and in vitro drug action in particular. It is a model system for the tissue types and genetic diversity of human cancers and has been extensively molecularly characterized. Here, we present a quantitative proteome and kinome profile of the NCI-60 panel covering, in total, 10,350 proteins (including 375 protein kinases) and including a core cancer proteome of 5,578 proteins that were consistently quantified across all tissue types. Bioinformatic analysis revealed strong cell line clusters according to tissue type and disclosed hundreds of differentially regulated proteins representing potential biomarkers for numerous tumor properties. Integration with public transcriptome data showed considerable similarity between mRNA and protein expression. Modeling of proteome and drug-response profiles for 108 FDA-approved drugs identified known and potential protein markers for drug sensitivity and resistance. To enable community access to this unique resource, we incorporated it into a public database for comparative and integrative analysis (http://wzw.tum.de/proteomics/nci60).

Abstract: Summary
Natural immunoglobulin M (IgM) is reactive to autoantigens and is believed to be important for autoimmunity. Blood pentameric IgM loaded with antigens forms a large immune complex (IC) that contains various elements, including apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM). Here we demonstrate that this IgM-AIM association contributes to autoantibody production under obese conditions. In mice fed a high-fat diet, natural IgM increased through B cell TLR4 stimulation. AIM associated with IgM and protected AIM from renal excretion, increasing blood AIM levels along with the obesity-induced IgM augmentation. Meanwhile, the AIM association inhibited IgM binding to the Fcα/μ receptor on splenic follicular dendritic cells, thereby protecting the IgM IC from Fcα/μ receptor-mediated internalization. This supported IgM-dependent autoantigen presentation to B cells, stimulating IgG autoantibody production. Accordingly, in obese AIM-deficient (AIM−/−) mice, the increase of multiple IgG autoantibodies observed in obese wild-type mice was abrogated. Thus, the AIM-IgM association plays a critical role in the obesity-associated autoimmune process.

Abstract: Summary
Spontaneous nucleation of actin is very inefficient in cells. To overcome this barrier, cells have evolved a set of actin filament nucleators to promote rapid nucleation and polymerization in response to specific stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism of actin nucleation remains poorly understood. This is hindered largely by the fact that actin nucleus, once formed, rapidly polymerizes into filament, thus making it impossible to capture stable multisubunit actin nucleus. Here, we report an effective double-mutant strategy to stabilize actin nucleus by preventing further polymerization. Employing this strategy, we solved the crystal structure of AMPPNP-actin in complex with the first two tandem W domains of Cordon-bleu (Cobl), a potent actin filament nucleator. Further sequence comparison and functional studies suggest that the nucleation mechanism of Cobl is probably shared by the p53 cofactor JMY, but not Spire. Moreover, the double-mutant strategy opens the way for atomic mechanistic study of actin nucleation and polymerization.

Abstract: We have previously reported that spectrin increases dramatically in amount and is assembled into the cytoskeleton in differentiating keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo (Zhao et al., PLoS ONE 6 (12) (2011) e28267). We demonstrate here that extracellular calcium (Ca2+) enhances differentiation of keratinocytes and that this is associated with increased spectrin expression and formation of a spectrin-based cytoskeleton. While Retinoic acid (RA) also enhanced keratinocyte differentiation, it abrogated the spectrin-based cytoskeleton in keratinocytes. Furthermore, RA substantially inhibited expression of both Src and PI3K-p85α and consequently the amounts of specific phosphorylation of both of these proteins. RA also enhanced AKT expression and dramatically induced phosphorylation of AKT(Thr308), accompanied by phosphorylation of both PKCδ(Thr505) and β-adducin(Ser662) and upregulated cyclin D2 and down-regulated cyclin B1. On the other hand, Ca2+ overcame the inhibitory effects of RA on expression of Src, PI3K-p85α and cyclin B1 by maintaining high levels of phosphorylation of both Src(Tyr527) and PI3K-p85α and preventing phosphorylation of AKT(Thr308), PKCδ(Thr505) and β-adducin(Ser662). These data highlight the importance of Ca2+ in both spectrin expression and the organizational integrity of the spectrin-based cytoskeleton in differentiating keratinocytes and assist in elucidating the signalling pathways involved.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo UV crosslinking identified numerous preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) binding sites for the large, highly conserved ribosome synthesis factor Rrp5. Intramolecular complementation has shown that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rrp5 is required for pre-rRNA cleavage at sites A0–A2 on the pathway of 18S rRNA synthesis, whereas the N-terminal domain (NTD) is required for A3 cleavage on the pathway of 5.8S/25S rRNA synthesis. The CTD was crosslinked to sequences flanking A2 and to the snoRNAs U3, U14, snR30, and snR10, which are required for cleavage at A0–A2. The NTD was crosslinked to sequences flanking A3 and to the RNA component of ribonuclease MRP, which cleaves site A3. Rrp5 could also be directly crosslinked to several large structural proteins and nucleoside triphosphatases. A key role in coordinating preribosomal assembly and processing was confirmed by chromatin spreads. Following depletion of Rrp5, cotranscriptional cleavage was lost and preribosome compaction greatly reduced.

Abstract: Summary
Elevated bile acid levels increase hepatocellular carcinoma by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that mice with a severe defect in bile acid homeostasis due to the loss of the nuclear receptors FXR and SHP have enlarged livers, progenitor cell proliferation, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation and develop spontaneous liver tumorigenesis. This phenotype mirrors mice with loss of hippo kinases or overexpression of their downstream target, YAP. Bile acids act as upstream regulators of YAP via a pathway dependent on the induction of the scaffold protein IQGAP1. Patients with diverse biliary dysfunctions exhibit enhanced IQGAP1 and nuclear YAP expression. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism for bile acid regulation of liver growth and tumorigenesis via the Hippo pathway.

Abstract: Scientific explorations on feto-maternal organ stem cells revealed its possible applicability in treatment of various diseases. However, establishment of an ideal placental tissue stem cell source in regenerative application is inconclusive and arduous. Hence, this study aims to resolve this tribulation by comparison of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from fetal placenta – amniotic membrane (AM-MSC), chorionic plate (CP-MSC) tissue and the maternal placenta-Decidua (D-MSC), thereby facilitating the researchers to determine their pertinent source. The cells were expanded and scrutinized for expression profiling, proliferation and differentiation ability. Remarkable expressions of certain markers in addition to its prospective mesodermal differentiation confirmed their mesenchyme origin. Despite the specified alikeness among these sources, reliable and non-invasive procurement of AM-MSC coupled with its higher growth potency makes it the most constructive stem cell source. However, exhibited similarities demands further investigations on extensive expandability and cytogenetic stability of these sources prior to its therapeutic applicability.

Abstract: Summary
Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic core of γ-secretase, which cleaves type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP). PS1 also has γ-secretase-independent functions, and dominant PS1 missense mutations are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Whether PS1 FAD mutations are gain- or loss-of-function remains controversial, primarily because most studies have relied on overexpression in mouse and/or nonneuronal systems. We used isogenic euploid human induced pluripotent stem cell lines to generate and study an allelic series of PS1 mutations, including heterozygous null mutations and homozygous and heterozygous FAD PS1 mutations. Rigorous analysis of this allelic series in differentiated, purified neurons allowed us to resolve this controversy and to conclude that FAD PS1 mutations, expressed at normal levels in the appropriate cell type, impair γ-secretase activity but do not disrupt γ-secretase-independent functions of PS1. Thus, FAD PS1 mutations do not act as simple loss of PS1 function but instead dominantly gain an activity toxic to some, but not all, PS1 functions.

Abstract: Summary
Spatially restricted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity plays a central role in patterning the follicular epithelium of the Drosophila ovary. In midoogenesis, localized EGFR activation is achieved by the graded dorsal anterior localization of its ligand, Gurken. Graded EGFR activity determines multiple dorsal anterior fates along the dorsal-ventral axis but cannot explain the sharp posterior limit of this domain. Here, we show that posterior follicle cells express the T-box transcription factors Midline and H15, which render cells unable to adopt a dorsal anterior fate in response to EGFR activation. The posterior expression of Midline and H15 is itself induced in early oogenesis by posteriorly localized EGFR signaling, defining a feedback loop in which early induction of Mid and H15 confers a molecular memory that fundamentally alters the outcome of later EGFR signaling. Spatial regulation of the EGFR pathway thus occurs both through localization of the ligand and through localized regulation of the cellular response.

Abstract: Current study encourages the differentiation of human endometrial stem cells into osteoblast-like cells using osteogenic media for potential bone tissue engineering purposes. A biomimetic nanocomposite scaffolds based on GEL/calcium phosphate were fabricated and behavior of differentiated osteoblast cells was evaluated after seeding on this scaffold. Prepared scaffolds were assessed in terms of attachment, alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expression and proliferation of osteoblast cells. The matrix mineralization was approved by alizarin red and the treated cultures with osteogenic media and BMP2 were positive for osteopontin and osteocalcin antibodies. RT-PCR confirmed presence of osteopontin, osteonectin and alkaline phosphatase mRNA after differentiation in EnSCs-derived osteoblast-like cells. Also, it has been shown that the biomimetic nanocomposites possess appropriate chemical and physical properties to support the attachment and proliferation of differentiated osteoblast cells.

Abstract: The culture of primary Sertoli cells has become an important resource in the study of their function. However, their use is limited because of contamination of isolated cells with other testicular cells, mainly germ cells. The aim was to establish technique to obtain pure yak Sertoli cells as well as to study the growth kinetics and biological characteristics of Sertoli cells in vitro. Two-step enzyme digestion was used to separate and culture yak Sertoli cells. Cultured using starvation method and the hypotonic treatment were also invented to get pure yak Sertoli cells. Furthermore, the purification of Yak Sertoli cells were identified according to their characteristics, such as bipolar corpuscular around the nucleus and expression of Fasl, in addition to their morphology. The average viability of the Sertoli cells was 97% before freezing and 94.5% after thawing, indicating that cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen had little influence on the viability of Sertoli cells. The growth tendency of yak Sertoli cells was similar to an S-shaped growth curve. Purified yak Sertoli cells frequently exhibited bipolar corpuscula in nucleus after Feulgen staining, and did have a positive reaction of Fasl by the immunocytochemical identification. After recovery chromosomal analysis of Sertoli cells had a normal chromosomal number of 60, comprising 29 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Assays for bacteria, fungi and mycoplasmas were negative. In conclusion, yak Sertoli cells have been successfully purified and cultured in vitro, and maintain stable biological characteristics after thawing. Therefore, it will not only preserve the genetic resources of yaks at the cellular level, but also provide valuable materials for transgenic research and feeder layer and nuclear donor cells in yak somatic cell cloning technology.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytosis of large extracellular particles such as apoptotic bodies requires delivery of the intracellular endosomal and lysosomal membranes to form plasmalemmal pseudopods. Here, we identified mucolipin TRP channel 1 (TRPML1) as the key lysosomal Ca2+ channel regulating focal exocytosis and phagosome biogenesis. Both particle ingestion and lysosomal exocytosis are inhibited by synthetic TRPML1 blockers and are defective in macrophages isolated from TRPML1 knockout mice. Furthermore, TRPML1 overexpression and TRPML1 agonists facilitate both lysosomal exocytosis and particle uptake. Using time-lapse confocal imaging and direct patch clamping of phagosomal membranes, we found that particle binding induces lysosomal PI(3,5)P2 elevation to trigger TRPML1-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release specifically at the site of uptake, rapidly delivering TRPML1-resident lysosomal membranes to nascent phagosomes via lysosomal exocytosis. Thus phagocytic ingestion of large particles activates a phosphoinositide- and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis pathway to provide membranes necessary for pseudopod extension, leading to clearance of senescent and apoptotic cells in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 20–60 bp downstream of transcription start sites is a major checkpoint during transcription in animal cells. Mechanisms that control pausing are largely unknown. We developed permanganate-ChIP-seq to evaluate the state of Pol II at promoters throughout the Drosophila genome, and a biochemical system that reconstitutes promoter-proximal pausing to define pausing mechanisms. Stable open complexes of Pol II are largely absent from the transcription start sites of most mRNA genes but are present at snRNA genes and the highly transcribed heat shock genes following their induction. The location of the pause is influenced by the timing between when NELF loads onto Pol II and how fast Pol II escapes the promoter region. Our biochemical analysis reveals that the sequence-specific transcription factor, GAF, orchestrates efficient pausing by recruiting NELF to promoters before transcription initiation and by assisting in loading NELF onto Pol II after initiation.

Rescue of Deleterious Mutations by the Compensatory Y30F Mutation in Ketosteroid Isomerase,

Abstract: Proteins have evolved to compensate for detrimental mutations. However, compensatory mechanisms for protein defects are not well understood. Using ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), we investigated how second-site mutations could recover defective mutant function and stability. Previous results revealed that the Y30F mutation rescued the Y14F, Y55F and Y14F/Y55F mutants by increasing the catalytic activity by 23-, 3- and 1.3-fold, respectively, and the Y55F mutant by increasing the stability by 3.3 kcal/mol. To better understand these observations, we systematically investigated detailed structural and thermodynamic effects of the Y30F mutation on these mutants. Crystal structures of the Y14F/Y30F and Y14F/Y55F mutants were solved at 2.0 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively, and compared with previoulsy solved structures of wild-type and other mutant KSIs. Structural analyses revealed that the Y30F mutation partially restored the active-site cleft of these mutant KSIs. The Y30F mutation also increased Y14F and Y14F/Y55F mutant stability by 3.2 and 4.3 kcal/mol, respectively, and the melting temperatures of the Y14F, Y55F and Y14F/Y55F mutants by 6.4°C, 5.1°C and 10.0°C, respectively. Compensatory effects of the Y30F mutation on stability might be due to improved hydrophobic interactions because removal of a hydroxyl group from Tyr30 induced local compaction by neighboring residue movement and enhanced interactions with surrounding hydrophobic residues in the active site. Taken together, our results suggest that perturbed active-site geometry recovery and favorable hydrophobic interactions mediate the role of Y30F as a second- site suppressor.

Abstract: L-type calcium channels are modulated by a host of mechanisms that include voltage, calcium ions (Ca2+ dependent inactivation and facilitation), cytosolic proteins (CAM, CAMKII, PKA, PKC, etc.), and oxygen radicals. Here we describe yet another Ca2+ channel regulatory mechanism that is induced by pressure-flow (PF) forces of ∼25dyn/cm2 producing 35–60% inhibition of channel current. Only brief periods (300ms) of such PF pulses were required to suppress reversibly the current. Recombinant Ca2+ channels (α1c77/β2a/α2δ and α1c77/β1/α2δ), expressed in HEK293 cells, were similarly suppressed by PF pulses. To examine whether Ca2+ released by PF pulses triggered from different sub-cellular compartments (SR, ER, mitochondria) underlies the inhibitory effect of PF on the channel current, pharmacological agents and ionic substitutions were employed to probe this possibility. No significant difference in effectiveness of PF pulses to suppress ICa or IBa (used to inhibit CICR) was found between control cells and those exposed to U73122 and 2-APB (PLC and IP3R pathway modulators), thapsigargin and BAPTA (SERCA2a modulator), dinitrophenol, FCCP and Ru360 (mitochondrial inhibitors), l-NAME (NOS inhibitor signaling), cAMP and Pertussis toxin (Gi protein modulator). We concluded that the rapid and reversible modulation of the Ca2+ channel by PF pulses is independent of intracellular release of Ca2+ and Ca2+ dependent inactivation of the channel and may represent direct mechanical regulatory effect on the channel protein in addition to previously reported Ca2+-release or entry dependent mechanism.
