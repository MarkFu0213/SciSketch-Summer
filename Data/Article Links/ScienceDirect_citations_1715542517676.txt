Abstract: Claudin-2 (CLDN2), a tight junctional protein, is involved in the chemoresistance in spheroid culture models of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. However, there is no chemical which can improve the sensitivity to anticancer drugs. So far, we reported that DFYSP, a short peptide which mimics the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CLDN2, decreases CLDN2 expression in A549 cells, but the concentration is relatively high. Here, we found that the effects of VPDSM and DSMKF are stronger than that of DFYSP. Both VPDSM and DSMKF decreased the protein levels of CLDN2 without affecting the mRNA levels of CLDN2. The peptide-induced decrease in CLDN2 expression was suppressed by monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) inhibitor, and chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor. CLDN2 was colocalized with ZO-1, an adapter protein, in tight junctions (TJs) under control conditions, whereas it disappeared from the TJs in the peptide-treated cells. Quartz crystal microbalance assay showed that both peptides can bind to recombinant CLDN2 protein. Both peptides increased permeability to paracellular transport marker lucifer yellow. In three-dimensional spheroid culture models, both peptides enhanced the sensitivity to doxorubicin, a cytotoxic anticancer drug, which was inhibited by MDC. We suggest that VPDSM and DSMKF enhance the chemosensitivity to anticancer drugs in aggregated adenocarcinoma cells mediated by the CDE pathway and lysosomal degradation of CLDN2 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. VPDSM and DSMKF, which mimic the ECL2 of CLDN2, may become novel adjuvant therapeutic drugs for lung adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Water influx through aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) has been linked to the ability of different cell types to migrate, and therefore plays an important part in processes like metastasis and angiogenesis. Since the erythroid growth factor erythropoietin (Epo) is now recognized as an angiogenesis promoter, we investigated the participation of AQP-1 as a downstream effector of this cytokine in the migration of endothelial cells. Inhibition of AQP-1 with either mercury ions (Hg2+) or a specific siRNA led to an impaired migration of EA.hy926 endothelial cells exposed to Epo (wound-healing assays). Epo also induced the expression of AQP-1 at mRNA and protein levels, an effect which was dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium through L-type calcium channels as well as TRPC3 channels. The relationship between Epo and AQP-1 was further confirmed at shorter exposure times, as the cytokine was unable to trigger calcium influxes in cells where AQP-1 had previously been knocked down. Moreover, Epo promoted changes in the subcellular localization of AQP-1 as well as rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton, which are consistent with a migratory phenotype. Worthy of note, carbamylated erythropoietin (cEpo), the non-erythropoietic and non-promigratory derivative of Epo, was incapable of AQP-1 modulation. The therapeutical implications of aquaporin targeting in angiogenesis-related diseases highlight the importance of the present results in the context of the relationship between AQP-1 and Epo.

Abstract: We address the contribution of kinase domain structure and catalytic activity to membrane trafficking of TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase. We conduct a systematic comparison between TrkA-wt, an ATP-binding defective mutant (TrkA-K544N) and other mutants displaying separate functional impairments of phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or recruitment of intracellular partners. We find that only K544N mutation endows TrkA with restricted membrane mobility and a substantial increase of cell surface pool already in the absence of ligand stimulation. This mutation is predicted to drive a structural destabilization of the αC helix in the N-lobe by molecular dynamics simulations, and enhances interactions with elements of the actin cytoskeleton. On the other hand, a different TrkA membrane immobilization is selectively observed after NGF stimulation, requires both phosphorylation and ubiquitination to occur, and is most probably related to the signaling abilities displayed by the wt but not mutated receptors. In conclusion, our results allow to distinguish two different TrkA membrane immobilization modes and demonstrate that not all kinase-inactive mutants display identical membrane trafficking.

Abstract: The development of functional and reliable in vitro cardiac models composed of fully mature cardiomyocytes is essential for improving drug screening test quality, therefore, the success of clinical trial outcomes. In their lifespan, cardiomyocytes undergo a dynamic maturation process from the fetal to adult stage, radically changing their metabolism, morphology, contractility and electrical properties. Before employing cells of human origin, in vitro models often use neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) to obtain key proof-of-principles. Nevertheless, NRCM monolayers are prone to de-differentiate when maintained in culture. Supplementation of free fatty acids (FFA), the main energy source for mature cardiomyocytes, and co-culture with fibroblasts are each by itself known to promote the shift from fetal to adult cardiomyocytes. Using a co-culture system, our study investigates the effects of FFA on the cardiomyocyte phenotype in comparison to glucose as typical fetal energy source, and to 10% serum used as standard control condition. NRCM decreased their differentiation status and fibroblasts increased in number after 7days of culture in the control condition. On the contrary, both glucose- and FFA-supplementation better preserved protein expression of myosin-light-chain-2v, a marker of mature cardiomyocytes, and the fibroblast number at levels similar to those found in freshly isolated NRCM. Nevertheless, compared to glucose, FFA resulted in a significant increase in sarcomere striation and organization. Our findings constitute an important step forward towards the definition of the optimal culture conditions, highlighting the possible benefits of a further supplementation of specific FFA to promote CM maturation in a co-culture system with FB.

Abstract: Cytochrome c (Cyt c) released from mitochondria interacts with Apaf-1 to form the heptameric apoptosome, which initiates the caspase cascade to execute apoptosis. Although lysine residue at 72 (K72) of Cyt c plays an important role in the Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction, the underlying mechanism of interaction between Cyt c and Apaf-1 is still not clearly defined. Here we identified multiple lysine residues including K72, which are also known to interact with ATP, to play a key role in Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction. Mutation of these lysine residues abrogates the apoptosome formation causing inhibition of caspase activation. Using in-silico molecular docking, we have identified Cyt c-binding interface on Apaf-1. Although mutant Cyt c shows higher affinity for Apaf-1, the presence of Cyt c-WT restores the apoptosome activity. ATP addition modulates only mutant Cyt c binding to Apaf-1 but not WT Cyt c binding to Apaf-1. Using TCGA and cBioPortal, we identified multiple mutations in both Apaf-1 and Cyt c that are predicted to interfere with apoptosome assembly. We also demonstrate that transcript levels of various enzymes involved with dATP or ATP synthesis are increased in various cancers. Silencing of nucleotide metabolizing enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) and ATP-producing glycolytic enzymes PKM2 attenuated ATP production and enhanced caspase activation. These findings suggest important role for lysine residues of Cyt c and nucleotides in the regulation of apoptosome-dependent apoptotic cell death as well as demonstrate how these mutations and nucleotides may have a pivotal role in human diseases such as cancer.

Abstract: The current study aims to evaluate whether peripheral blood miR-324-5p could be used to differentiate patients with metabolic disorders and healthy controls. Our data showed that miR-324-5p levels were elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia. In addition, the expression of miR-324-5p was enhanced in the peripheral blood and liver of db/db mice. Further study indicated that overexpression of miR-324-5p reduced the activation of the AKT/GSK pathway and increased lipid accumulation, while the inhibition of miR-324-5p activated the AKT/GSK pathway and decreased lipid accumulation. A dual luciferase assay revealed that Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) was a target gene of miR-324-5p. In addition, silencing ROCK1 deteriorated lipid and glucose metabolism. More importantly, knockdown of ROCK1 reversed the miR-324-5p inhibitor-induced improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. In summary, miR-324-5p plays a regulatory role in glucose and lipid metabolism by targeting ROCK1, which is involved in metabolic disorders. The use of miR-324-5p in diagnosing metabolic syndrome is worth investigating and may benefit patients.

Abstract: Lysphosphatidic acid (LPA) is a major natural bioactive lipid mediator whose biological functions affect multiple organs. These include bone as demonstrated by global Lpar1-knockout mice (Lpar1−/−) which present a bone growth defect. LPA acts on all bone cells including osteoblasts, that are responsible for bone formation, and osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that resorb bone. LPA appears as a potential new coupling molecule during bone remodeling. LPA1 is the most ubiquitous LPA receptor among the six LPA receptor family members (LPA1–6). To better understand the specific role of LPA via its receptor LPA1 in osteoblastic cell lineage we generated osteoblast-specific Lpar1 knockout mice (Lpar1-∆Ob) by crossing Lpar1flox/flox and Osx:Cre+ mouse lines. Lpar1-∆Ob mice do not recapitulate the bone defects of Lpar1−/− mice but revealed reduced bone mineralization and decreased cortical thickness, as well as increased bone porosity associated with an augmentation in the lacunae areas of osteocyte and their apoptotic yield. In vitro, primary Lpar1-∆Ob and immortalized cl1-Ob-Lpar1−/− osteoblasts revealed a remarkable premature expression of alkaline phosphatase, reduced cell proliferation associated with decreased YAP-P nuclear accumulation, and reduced mineralization activity. Osteocyte specification is markedly impaired as demonstrated by reduced expression of early (E11) and late (DMP1, DKK1, SOST) osteocyte markers ex vivo in enriched osteocytic fractions of Lpar1-∆Ob mouse bone explants. In addition, E11 expression and dendrite formation induced by FGF2 are markedly impaired in both primary Lpar1-∆Ob and immortalized cl1-Ob-Lpar1−/− osteoblasts. Taken together these results suggest a new role for LPA in bone mass control via bone mineralization and osteocyte function.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder affecting between 20 and 30% of adults in the United States. However, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for treating NAFLD. Niacin, a water-soluble vitamin (B3), at pharmacological doses, decreases hepatic triglyceride (TG) content in NAFLD through inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, a key enzyme that catalyzes the final step in TG synthesis. Alternatively, some studies indicate that niacin induces fatty liver in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether niacin is beneficial in treating NAFLD in two strains of mice, C57BL/6J (B6) and B6129SF2/J (B6129) mice, with 20 weeks of HFD feeding. Niacin treatment was started from week 5 until the end of the study. Niacin treatment increased normalized liver weight, hepatic TG content and NAFLD score in HFD-fed B6129 mice but had no impact on B6 mice. Metabolomics analysis revealed that in B6129 mice, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), which is associated with fatty acid oxidation, did not change with HFD feeding but significantly decreased with niacin treatment. Lipidomics analysis discovered that the abundance of phosphocholine (PC), which is critical for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)–TG production and secretion, was decreased in HFD-fed B6129 with niacin treatment. In conclusion, niacin had no impact on diet-induced NAFLD development in B6 mice but potentiated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed B6129 mice due to impaired fatty acid oxidation and decreased VLDL-TG production and secretion.

Abstract: Cannabis use has been increasing worldwide for recreational and medical purposes. Consumption by pregnant women is associated with disturbances in pregnancy outcome, such as low birth weight, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, though the underlying biochemical mechanisms are unknown. The endocannabinoid system is involved in several reproductive events and the disruption of its homeostasis by ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive cannabinoid, may lead to a negative gestational outcome. In human placenta, THC impairs the levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). The other major endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) also plays an important role on proper placentation and pregnancy success. However, THC impact on 2-AG homeostasis has never been addressed. Hence, the effects of THC in 2-AG levels and metabolic enzymes expression were explored. Long-term treatment impairs the expression of the main 2-AG synthetic and degradative enzymes. Curiously, with the highest concentration, despite the maintenance of diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGLα) and the decrease in monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) expression, 2-AG levels remain constant. Given the endocannabinoid signalling local tight regulation, we hypothesize the involvement of other 2-AG degradative enzymes. Indeed, THC increases the expression of the hydrolyzing enzymes alpha beta hydrolase domain-6 (ABHD6) and -12 (ABHD12), that we firstly describe in human placental tissues. The results show that THC, depending on time of exposure, induces alterations in 2-AG metabolic enzymes expression in placental explants, highlighting the importance of 2-AG regulation and endocannabinoid signalling in placental development. Alterations in this homeostasis may explain the negative pregnancy outcome related to cannabis consumption.

Abstract: Dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in obesity can lead to lipotoxicity and cellular damage. Renal lipotoxicity in association with an impairment of lipid metabolism induces renal damage through the activation of inflammation, ER stress, fibrosis and apoptosis. We investigated the effects of a combination treatment of the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin and atorvastatin on renal lipotoxicity related to renal dysfunction and injury in a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFF)-induced insulin resistant condition. Male Wistar rats were fed on a high-fat diet and were given drinking water with 10% fructose for 16 weeks. After that, rats were divided into: no treatment (HFF), treatment with vildagliptin, atorvastatin and vildagliptin plus atorvastatin for 4 weeks. The results demonstrated that the combination treatment prominently improved insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and kidney morphological changes induced by HFF. These changes correlated well with the increased expression of nephrin and podocin and decreased urine protein. Notably, the combined treatment produced greater improvement in renal lipid metabolism through increasing fatty acid oxidation with the decreases in fatty acid transporters and fatty acid synthesis, thereby reducing renal lipid accumulation in HFF rats. The reduction in renal lipotoxicity via diminishing renal inflammation, ER stress, fibrosis and apoptosis was also more significant in the combined treatment group than in the other groups in which the drug was used as a monotherapy. In conclusion, the combination therapy produced synergistic beneficial effects on metabolic parameters, lipid metabolism and accumulation related to renal lipid accumulation-induced lipotoxicity and kidney injury in the HFF-induced insulin resistant model with improved outcomes.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) has different molecular features along progression, including androgen profile, which is associated to therapy inefficiency leading to more aggressive phenotype. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in different cancers associated to cell metabolism modulation. The latter is of particular interest since metabolic reprogramming is one of PCa hallmarks, but is not clear how this occurs among disease progression. Therefore, we evaluated DHA antiproliferative potential in distinct androgenic backgrounds associated to metabolism modulation and androgen-regulated genes. For this purpose, pre-malignant PNT1A and tumor AR-positive 22rv1, and AR-negative PC3 cells were incubated with DHA at 100 μM–48 h. DHA reduced at least 26% cell number for all lineages due to S-phase decrease in AR-positive and G2/M arrest in AR-negative. Mitochondrial metabolic rate decreased in PNT1A (~38%) and increased in tumor cells (at least 40%). This was associated with ROS overproduction (1.6-fold PNT1A; 2.1 22rv1; 2.2 PC3), lipid accumulation (3-fold PNT1A; 1.8 22rv1; 3.6 PC3) and mitochondria damage in all cell lines. AKT, AMPK and PTEN were not activated in any cell line, but p-ERK1/2 increased (1.5-fold) in PNT1A. Expression of androgen-regulated and nuclear receptors genes showed that DHA affected them in a distinct pattern in each cell line, but most converged to metabolism regulation, response to hormones, lipids and stress. In conclusion, regardless of androgenic or PTEN background DHA exerted antiproliferative effect associated to cell cycle impairment, lipid deregulation and oxidative stress, but differentially regulated gene expression probably due to distinct molecular features of each pathologic stage.

Abstract: Porcine zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs along with global epigenetic remodeling at the 4-cell stage. These processes are regulated by histone acetylation, which requires acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a crucial enzyme in glucose metabolism that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. In mammalian cells, acetyl-CoA is produced by pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1 (PDHA1) translocated into the nucleus in special conditions. To determine whether zygotic PDHA1 plays a critical role in promoting histone acetylation during ZGA, a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system using multiple guide RNAs was employed to generate a PDHA1-targeted parthenogenetic embryo model. Results of immunofluorescent staining showed that the nuclear accumulation of PDHA1 during ZGA was significantly inhibited by PDHA1 targeting. Meanwhile, the 4-cell arrest rate significantly increased at 72 h after activation, indicating impeded embryonic development. In addition, nuclear histone acetylation significantly decreased when PDHA1 was targeted, and quantitative PCR showed that expression of several zygotic genes was significantly decreased in the PDHA1-targeting group compared to the control group. Overexpression of PDHA1 recovered the nuclear PDHA1, H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac and EIF1A expression levels. Moreover, the 5-to-8-cell-stage embryo development rate was only partially rescued. In conclusion, expression of zygotic origin PDHA1 contributes to porcine ZGA by maintaining histone acetylation in porcine embryos.

Abstract: The CYP74B subfamily of fatty acid hydroperoxide transforming cytochromes P450 includes the most common plant enzymes. All CYP74Bs studied yet except the CYP74B16 (flax divinyl ether synthase, LuDES) and the CYP74B33 (carrot allene oxide synthase, DcAOS) are 13-hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs, synonym: hemiacetal synthases). The results of present work demonstrate that additional products (except the HPL products) of fatty acid hydroperoxides conversion by the recombinant StHPL (CYP74B3, Solanum tuberosum), MsHPL (CYP74B4v1, Medicago sativa), and CsHPL (CYP74B6, Cucumis sativus) are epoxyalcohols. MsHPL, StHPL, and CsHPL converted the 13-hydroperoxides of linoleic (13-HPOD) and α-linolenic acids (13-HPOT) primarily to the chain cleavage products. The minor by-products of 13-HPOD and 13-HPOT conversions by these enzymes were the oxiranyl carbinols, 11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic and 11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9,15-octadecadienoic acid. At the same time, all enzymes studied converted 9-hydroperoxides into corresponding oxiranyl carbinols with HPL by-products. Thus, the results showed the additional epoxyalcohol synthase activity of studied CYP74B enzymes. The 13-HPOD conversion reliably resulted in smaller yields of the HPL products and bigger yields of the epoxyalcohols compared to the 13-HPOT transformation. Overall, the results show the dualistic HPL/EAS behaviour of studied CYP74B enzymes, depending on hydroperoxide isomerism and unsaturation.

Abstract: Methylation of proteins is emerging to be an important regulator of protein function. SET7/9, a protein lysine methyltransferase, catalyses methylation of several proteins involved in diverse biological processes. SET7/9-mediated methylation often regulates the stability, sub-cellular localization and protein-protein interactions of its substrate proteins. Here, we aimed to identify novel biological processes regulated by SET7/9 by identifying new interaction partners. For this we used yeast two-hybrid screening and identified the large subunit ribosomal protein, eL42 as a potential interactor of SET7/9. We confirmed the SET7/9-eL42 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown studies. The N-terminal MORN domain of SET7/9 is essential for its interaction with eL42. Importantly, we identified that SET7/9 methylates eL42 at three different lysines - Lys53, Lys80 and Lys100 through site-directed mutagenesis. By puromycin incorporation assay, we find that SET7/9-mediated methylation of eL42 affects global translation. This study identifies a new role of the functionally versatile SET7/9 lysine methyltransferase in the regulation of global protein synthesis.

Abstract: In egress routes of malignancy, cancer cells are constantly subjected to shear stress imposed by blood/lymph flow. Increasing evidence points toward the regulatory roles of shear stress in tumor cell adhesion and motility. Although it is known that integrin endocytic trafficking governs focal adhesion (FA) turnover and cell migration, the effect and biological consequences of low shear stress (LSS) on integrin trafficking remain unclear. Here, we identified the critical role of integrin β1 trafficking and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mediated endocytosis in LSS-induced cell directional migration. LSS altered the distribution of integrin β1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and significantly promoted its internalization and recycling, which in turn facilitated FA turnover and directional cell migration. Furthermore, LSS induced cytoskeleton remodeling, which was required for internalization of integrin β1. LSS down-regulated the acetylation level of microtubules (MTs) via activating ROCK/HDAC6 pathway, resulting in elevation of MTs dynamics, Cav-1 motility, and Cav-1-dependent integrin β1 recycling. We also showed that high HDAC6 expression was a ROCK-dependent prognostic factor, which was correlated with poor outcomes in breast cancer patients. Taken together, these results defined a novel mechanism by which LSS enhanced integrin β1 trafficking via actin cytoskeleton remodeling and ROCK/HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of MTs, thereby promoting FAs turnover and directional cell migration.

Abstract: The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has emerged in the last three decades as main regulator of key cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation. A crucial role for this sphingolipid has been recognized in skeletal muscle cell biology both in vitro and in vivo. S1P lyase (SPL) is responsible for the irreversible degradation of S1P and together with sphingosine kinases, the S1P producing enzymes, regulates cellular S1P levels. In this study is clearly showed that the blockade of SPL by pharmacological or RNA interference approaches induces myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, down-regulation of the specific S1P transporter spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) abrogates myogenic differentiation brought about by SPL inhibition or down-regulation, pointing at a role of extracellular S1P in the pro-myogenic action induced by SPL blockade. Furthermore, also S1P2 receptor down-regulation was found to abrogate the pro-myogenic effect of SPL blockade. These results provide further proof that inside-out S1P signaling is critically implicated in skeletal muscle biology and provide support to the concept that the specific targeting of SPL could represent an exploitable strategy to treat skeletal muscle disorders.

Abstract: Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a fatal rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of insoluble abnormal glycogen deposits in the brain and peripheral tissues. Mutations in at least two genes are responsible for the disease: EPM2A, encoding the glucan phosphatase laforin, and EPM2B, encoding the RING-type E3-ubiquitin ligase malin. Both laforin and malin form a functional complex in which laforin recruits the substrates to be ubiquitinated by malin. We and others have described that, in cellular and animal models of this disease, there is an autophagy impairment which leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. In addition, we established that the autophagic defect occurred at the initial steps of autophagosome formation. In this work, we present evidence that in cellular models of the disease there is a decrease in the amount of phosphatidylinositol-3P. This is probably due to defective regulation of the autophagic PI3KC3 complex, in the absence of a functional laforin/malin complex. In fact, we demonstrate that the laforin/malin complex interacts physically and co-localizes intracellularly with core components of the PI3KC3 complex (Beclin1, Vps34 and Vps15), and that this interaction is specific and results in the polyubiquitination of these proteins. In addition, the laforin/malin complex is also able to polyubiquitinate ATG14L and UVRAG. Finally, we show that overexpression of the laforin/malin complex increases PI3KC3 activity. All these results suggest a new role of the laforin/malin complex in the activation of autophagy via regulation of the PI3KC3 complex and explain the defect in autophagy described in Lafora disease.

Abstract: Background
Advanced cancer induces fundamental cardiac changes and promotes body wasting and heart failure. We evaluated the impact of cancer on major cardiac signalling pathways, and resulting consequences for the heart.
Methods and results
Metastatic melanoma disease was induced in male C57BL/6 N mice by intraperitoneal injection of the melanoma cell line B16F10 and lead to cardiac atrophy and heart failure. Analyses of key cardiac signalling pathways in left ventricular tissue revealed increased activation of STAT3 and reduced activation of AKT, p38 and ERK1/2. Markers of the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS: Atrogin-1) and of mitophagy/autophagy (LC3b, BNIP3) were upregulated. Tumour-bearing C57BL/6 N mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a constitutively active AKT transgene (AKTtg) displayed less cardiac atrophy and dysfunction and normalized Atrogin-1, LC3b and BNIP3 expression while the cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of STAT3 (CKO) had no major effect on these parameters compared to WT.
Conclusion
Cancer alters major cardiac signalling pathways and subsequently the UPS, mitophagy and autophagy. The present study suggests that cancer-induced reduction of cardiomyocyte AKT contributes to these alterations as they were attenuated in tumour-bearing AKTtg mice. In turn, increased cardiomyocyte STAT3 activation appears less relevant, as tumour-induced impairment on the heart was largely similar in CKO and WT mice. Since oncologic therapies frequently target AKT and/or STAT3, their impact on the heart might be different in tumour-bearing mice compared to healthy mice, a feature suggesting to test tumour therapies also in tumour disease models and not only under healthy conditions.

Abstract: Microtubule-dependent motors usually work together to transport organelles through the crowded intracellular milieu. Thus, transport performance depends on how motors organize on the cargo. Unfortunately, the lack of methodologies capable of measuring this organization in cells determines that many aspects of the collective action of motors remain elusive. Here, we combined fluorescence fluctuations and single particle tracking techniques to address how kinesins organize on rod-like mitochondria moving along microtubules in cells. This methodology simultaneously provides mitochondria trajectories and EGFP-tagged kinesin-1 intensity at different mitochondrial positions with millisecond resolution. We show that kinesin exchange at the mitochondrion surface is within ~100 ms and depends on the organelle speed. During anterograde transport, the mitochondrial leading tip presents slower motor exchange in comparison to the rear tip. In contrast, retrograde mitochondria show similar exchange rates of kinesins at both tips. Numerical simulations provide theoretical support to these results and evidence that motors do not share the load equally during intracellular transport.

Abstract: Background
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are a unique source of human cardiomyocytes for cardiac disease modeling. Incomplete functional maturation remains a major limitation, however. One of the determinants of iPSC-CM maturation is somatic cell origin. We therefore compared iPSC-CMs derived from different somatic cell sources.
Methods
Cardiac-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (CPCs), bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMCs), and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) from same patients were reprogrammed into iPSCs and differentiated into iPSC-CMs. Expression of cardiac-specific genes, caffeine-responsive cells, and electrophysiological properties of differentiated cells were analyzed. To assess the contribution of epigenetic memory toward differences in gene expression observed during cardiac differentiation, DNA methylation patterns were determined in the early mesodermal cardiac promoter NKX2–5 and KCNQ1, which encodes for the pore-forming α-subunit of the slow component of delayed-rectifier potassium current (IKs).
Results
Cardiac genes (MYH6, TNNI3, KCNQ1, KCNE1) were upregulated in CPC-vs. BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. At early differentiation stages, CPC-iPSC-CMs displayed higher numbers of caffeine-responsive cells than BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. The hERG1 (KV11.1) blocker, E4031, followed by the IKs blocker, JNJ303, increased extracellular field potential duration in CPC-iPSC-CMs to a greater extent than in BMC- and HDF-iPSC-CMs. The promoter region of NKX2–5 was more highly methylated in BMCs and HDFs compared to CPCs, and to a lesser extent in BMC-iPSCs compared to CPC-iPSCs.
Conclusions
These results suggest that human iPSCs from cardiac somatic cell sources may display enhanced capacity toward cardiac re-differentiation compared to non-cardiac cell sources, and that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in this regard.

Abstract: There is an increasing need to explore the mechanism of the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Steroid metabolism is closely linked to hepatic steatosis and steroids are excreted as bile acids (BAs). Here, we demonstrated that feeding WKAH/HkmSlc inbred rats a diet supplemented with cholic acid (CA) at 0.5 g/kg for 13 weeks induced simple steatosis without obesity. Liver triglyceride and cholesterol levels were increased accompanied by mild elevation of aminotransferase activities. There were no signs of inflammation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, or fibrosis. CA supplementation increased levels of CA and taurocholic acid (TCA) in enterohepatic circulation and deoxycholic acid (DCA) levels in cecum with an increased ratio of 12α-hydroxylated BAs to non-12α-hydroxylated BAs. Analyses of hepatic gene expression revealed no apparent feedback control of BA and cholesterol biosynthesis. CA feeding induced dysbiosis in cecal microbiota with enrichment of DCA producers, which underlines the increased cecal DCA levels. The mechanism of steatosis was increased expression of Srebp1 (positive regulator of liver lipogenesis) through activation of the liver X receptor by increased oxysterols in the CA-fed rats, especially 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βOH) formed by upregulated expression of hepatic Cyp3a2, responsible for 4βOH formation. Multiple regression analyses identified portal TCA and cecal DCA as positive predictors for liver 4βOH levels. The possible mechanisms linking these predictors and upregulated expression of Cyp3a2 are discussed. Overall, our observations highlight the role of 12α-hydroxylated BAs in triggering liver lipogenesis and allow us to explore the mechanisms of hepatic steatosis onset, focusing on cholesterol and BA metabolism.

Abstract: Background
There is a growing concern that junk food has contributed to the childhood obesity epidemic. Recently, experimental studies suggested that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene is strongly linked to western diet-induced obesity.
Aim
This study investigated the potential role of AHR signaling in childhood obesity and the possible associations of the AHR-aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR)-cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) axis with fatty acid homeostasis and the appetite-related hormones, leptin and ghrelin.
Subjects and methods
The study included 80 children; 54 obese and 26 non-obese of matched age and sex. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements, and lipid profile were assessed. Expression of AHR signaling genes was analyzed in blood cells by qRT-PCR. Serum insulin, leptin and ghrelin levels were measured using ELISA.
Results
The statistical power of this study, calculated using G*Power version 3.1.9.2, was 90% (α = 0.05). AHR and CYP1B1 gene expression levels were upregulated in the obese group compared to controls, whereas AHRR, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) were downregulated. Serum leptin correlated positively, while serum ghrelin correlated negatively with both AHR and CYP1B1. Stratification of obese children by age revealed more activated AHR signaling in younger than in older children. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that AHR, AHRR and CYP1B1 could discriminate between obese and normal weight children. Multivariate analysis showed that AHRR, CYP1B1 and ghrelin could be significant independent predictors of obesity.
Conclusion
This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to childhood obesity by revealing alterations in the AHR-AHRR-CYP1B1 axis, which could serve as a promising therapeutic target for childhood obesity.

Abstract: Vitamin A is stored as retinyl esters (REs) in lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). To date, two different pathways are known to facilitate the breakdown of REs: (i) Hydrolysis of REs by neutral lipases, and (ii) whole lipid droplet degradation in autolysosomes by acid hydrolysis. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of neutral and acid RE hydrolases to the breakdown of REs in human HSCs. (R)-Bromoenol lactone (R-BEL), inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3), the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) inhibitor 76-0079, as well as the serine-hydrolase inhibitor Orlistat reduced neutral RE hydrolase activity of LX-2 cell-lysates between 20 and 50%. Interestingly, in pulse-chase experiments, R-BEL, 76-0079, as well as Orlistat exerted little to no effect on cellular RE breakdown of LX-2 cells as well as primary human HSCs. In contrast, Lalistat2, a specific lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) inhibitor, virtually blunted acid in vitro RE hydrolase activity of LX-2 cells. Accordingly, HSCs isolated from LAL-deficient mice showed RE accumulation and were virtually devoid of acidic RE hydrolase activity. In pulse-chase experiments however, LAL-deficient HSCs, similar to LX-2 cells and primary human HSCs, were not defective in degrading REs. In summary, results demonstrate that ATGL, PNPLA3, and HSL contribute to neutral RE hydrolysis of human HSCs. LAL is the major acid RE hydrolase in HSCs. Yet, LAL is not limiting for RE degradation under serum-starvation. Together, results suggest that RE breakdown of HSCs is facilitated by (a) so far unknown, non-Orlistat inhibitable RE-hydrolase(s).

Abstract: Increased Pur-alpha (Pura) protein levels in animal models alleviate certain cellular symptoms of the disease spectrum amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). Pura is a member of the Pur family of evolutionarily conserved guanine-rich polynucleotide binding proteins containing a repeated signature PUR domain of 60–80 amino acids. Here we have employed a synthetic peptide, TZIP, similar to a Pur domain, but with sequence alterations based on a consensus of evolutionarily conserved Pur family binding domains and having an added transporter sequence. A major familial form of ALS/FTD, C9orf72 (C9), is due to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) of (GGGGCC), a Pur binding element. We show by circular dichroism that RNA oligonucleotides containing this purine-rich sequence consist largely of parallel G-quadruplexes. TZIP peptide binds this repeat sequence in both DNA and RNA. It binds the RNA element, including the G-quadruplexes, with a high degree of specificity versus a random oligonucleotide. In addition, TZIP binds both linear and G-quadruplex repeat RNA to form higher order G-quadruplex secondary structures. This change in conformational form by Pur-based peptide represents a new mechanism for regulating G quadruplex secondary structure within the C9 repeat. TZIP modulation of C9 RNA structural configuration may alter interaction of the complex with other proteins. This Pur-based mechanism provides new targets for therapy, and it may help to explain Pura alleviation of certain cellular pathological aspects of ALS/FTD.

Abstract: Although obesity contributes to the onset and pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that being overweight or mildly obese carries a survival advantage compared with being thin or normal-weight. This relationship is called the obesity paradox. Hence, it is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanism of obesity onset for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Catalase is distributed in peroxisomes under normal redox conditions and catalase activity is increased during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. Although peroxisomes are responsible for lipid metabolism, the role of peroxisomal catalase in the process of lipid accumulation remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships among catalase activity, peroxisome content, and lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. Increased catalase activity and lipid accumulation were observed during the differentiation of preadipocytes. Silencing of catalase by small interfering RNA or treatment with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), a catalase inhibitor, resulted in reduced lipid accumulation. Inhibition of catalase activity in peroxisomes increases hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, which results in a reduction of peroxisome content. Extracellular H2O2 had no influence on lipid accumulation during differentiation. The occurrence of autophagy was clearly enhanced in cells treated with 3-AT. Spautin-1, an inhibitor of autophagy flux, protected against a reduction in lipid accumulation by treatment with 3-AT. Our data provide evidence that catalase protects against the degradation of peroxisomes via the occurrence of autophagy triggered by the generation of H2O2 in peroxisomes. These results suggest that catalase in peroxisomes is crucial to adipogenesis.

Abstract: Molecular interactions of tumor cells with the microenvironment are regarded as onset of chemotherapy resistance, referred to as cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Here we elucidate a mechanism of CAM-DR in breast cancer cells in vitro. We show that human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decrease their sensitivity towards cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone cytotoxicity upon binding to collagen type 1 (COL1) or fibronectin (FN). The intracellular concentrations of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone were decreased upon cell cultivation on COL1, while cellular cisplatin levels remained unaffected. Since doxorubicin and mitoxantrone are transporter substrates, this refers to ATP binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter activities. The activation of the transporters BCRP, P-gp and MRP1 was shown by fluorescence assays to distinguish the individual input of these transporters to resistance in presence of COL1 and related to their expression levels by western blot. An ABC transporter inhibitor was able to re-sensitize COL1-treated cells for doxorubicin and mitoxantrone toxicity. Antibody-blocking of β1-integrin (ITGB1) induced sensitization towards the indicated cytostatic drugs by attenuating the increased ABC efflux activity. This refers to a key role of ITGB1 for matrix binding and subsequent transporter activation. A downregulation of α2β1 integrin following COL1 binding appears as clear indication for the relationship between ITGB1 and ABC transporters in regulating resistance formation, while knockdown of ITGB1 leads to a significant upregulation of all three transporters. Our data provide evidence for a role of CAM-DR in breast cancer via an ITGB1 – transporter axis and offer promising therapeutic targets for cancer sensitization.

Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming leading to alterations in lipid metabolism and lipid-mediated signaling may contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression. We hypothesized that a detailed description of changes in sphingolipidome of specific cellular subpopulation residing in colon cancer tissue may help to discriminate between normal and transformed colon epithelial cells. Using HPLC-mass spectrometry, we analyzed the EpCAM-positive cells isolated from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues of colon cancer patients, aiming to identify potential lipid biomarkers specific for CRC. We then employed RT-qPCR-based methodology in order to analyze expression of SL metabolism-related genes in the isolated EpCAM-positive tumor cells and/or in unseparated colon tumor tissues. We observed significant changes in sphingolipid (SL) species in the EpCAM-positive tumor cells, with the accumulation of lactosylceramide (LacCer) being the most prominent. B4GALT5 and B4GALT6 genes were identified as two potential gene candidates contributing to LacCer accumulation. We further identified additional genes of SL and fatty acid metabolism (e.g. SPHK1, GBA2, NEU3, GLA, FASN, PLA2G10), which were significantly altered in colon tumor tissue.

Abstract: Objective
In muscle cells, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1 (PGC-1) signaling network, which has been shown to be disturbed in the skeletal muscle in several chronic diseases, tightly controls mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative substrate metabolism. Previously, we showed that inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β potently increased Pgc-1α abundance and oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle cells. The current study aims to unravel the molecular mechanism driving the increase in Pgc-1α mediated by GSK-3β inactivation.
Methods
GSK-3β was inactivated genetically or pharmacologically in C2C12 myotubes and the requirement of transcription factors known to be involved in Pgc-1α transcription for increases in Pgc-1α abundance mediated by inactivation of GSK-3β was examined.
Results
Enhanced PGC-1α promoter activation after GSK-3β inhibition suggested a transcriptionally-controlled mechanism. While myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcriptional activity was unaltered, GSK-3β inactivation increased the abundance and activity of the transcription factors estrogen-related receptor (ERR)α and ERRγ. Pharmacological inhibition or knock-down of ERRα and ERRγ however failed to prevent increases in Pgc-1α mRNA mediated by GSK-3β inactivation. Interestingly, GSK-3β inactivation activated transcription factor EB (TFEB), evidenced by decreased phosphorylation and enhanced nuclear localization of the TFEB protein. Moreover, knock-down of TFEB completely prevented increases in Pgc-1α gene expression, PGC-1α promoter activity and PGC-1α protein abundance induced by GSK-3β inactivation. Furthermore, mutation of a specific TFEB binding site on the PGC-1α promoter blocked promoter activation upon inhibition of GSK-3β.
Conclusions
In skeletal muscle, GSK-3β inactivation causes dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB resulting in TFEB-dependent induction of Pgc-1α expression.

Abstract: Cisplatin-based chemotherapies have long been considered as a standard chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. However, cisplatin resistance restricts beneficial therapy for patients with ovarian cancer. The ubiquitin-like protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes a 15-kDa protein, that is implicated in the post-translational modification of diverse proteins. In this work, we found that ISG15 was downregulated in cisplatin resistant tissues and cell lines of ovarian cancer. Functional studies demonstrated that overexpression of wild type (WT) ISG15, but not nonISGylatable (Mut) ISG15 increased cell responses to cisplatin in resistant ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that WT ISG15 decreased ABCC2 expression at the protein level. Importantly, overexpression of ABCC2 blocked sensitizing effect of ISG15 on cisplatin. In addition, we identified that hnRNPA2B1 was recruited to 5′UTR of ABCC2 mRNA and promoted its translation, which was blocked by ISG15. We further demonstrated that hnRNPA2B1 could be ISGylated, and ISGylation blocked its recruitment to ABCC2 mRNA, thereby suppressed translation of ABCC2. Altogether, our data support targeting ISG15 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic organelles involved in intracellular lipid metabolism, and the biogenesis of LDs in endothelium is triggered by the excess of lipids in the environment. In this paper we present the methodology aimed to define the composition of endothelial LDs formed upon stimulation with oleic acid (OA) in two models: endothelial cells cultured in vitro and in isolated blood vessel ex vivo. The biochemical composition of LDs was determined using Raman imaging, followed by the lipid unsaturation calibration analysis and modelling of spectral bands based on individual spectra of selected lipids. Among LDs formed in response to OA in vitro or ex vivo conditions there were two types of LDs; those with more unsaturated (average number of CC bonds equalled 1.40) or saturated (average number of CC bonds equalled 0.95) lipids. The modelling of endothelial LDs composition revealed the OA represented a major component of LDs (80.6–91.3%) with an important content of arachidonic acid (8.7–19.4%). In conclusion, endothelial LDs consist of exogenous oleic acid uptaken from the extracellular space, and the endogenous arachidonic acid released from plasma membranes.

Abstract: Lipoproteins play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. High and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL), known as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol, respectively, remove and/or deposit lipids into the artery wall. Hence, insight into lipid exchange processes between lipoproteins and cell membranes is of particular importance in understanding the onset and development of cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the impact of phospholipid tail saturation and the presence of cholesterol in cell membranes on these processes, neutron reflection was employed in the present investigation to follow lipid exchange with both HDL and LDL against model membranes. Mirroring clinical risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, lower exchange was observed in the presence of cholesterol, as well as for an unsaturated phospholipid, compared to faster exchange when using a fully saturated phospholipid. These results highlight the importance of membrane composition on the interaction with lipoproteins, chiefly the saturation level of the lipids and presence of cholesterol, and provide novel insight into factors of importance for build-up and reversibility of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, the correlation between the results and well-established clinical risk factors suggests that the approach taken can be employed also for understanding a broader set of risk factors including, e.g., effects of triglycerides and oxidative stress, as well as local effects of drugs on atherosclerotic plaque formation.

Abstract: Kinesin-6 KIF20A is essential for microtubule organization and central spindle assembly during cytokinesis. However, the functions of KIF20A in meiotic division and spermatogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report that kinesin-6 KIF20A locates at the microtubules in mouse spermatogenic cells and co-localizes with the spindle midzone and midbody. We demonstrate that central spindle organization and chromosomal stability are regulated by KIF20A in male meiotic division. KIF20A inhibition leads to the defects in central spindle assembly and cytokinetic abscission, and finally results in the increase of aneuploid cells and the alteration of cell populations in the spermatogenic cells. Furthermore, we have revealed that kinesin-6 KIF20A is associated with the formation and maturation of the acrosomes during spermatogenesis. Our findings have identified the specific roles of KIF20A in central spindle organization in meiotic division.

Abstract: Transfection is a powerful tool that enables introducing foreign nucleic acids into living cells in order to study the function of a gene product. Ever since the discovery of transfection many side effects or artifacts caused by transfection reagents have been reported. Here, we show that the transfection reagent, JetPRIME alters the localization of the splicing protein SC35 widely used as a nuclear speckle marker. We demonstrate that transfection of plasmids with JetPRIME leads to enlarged SC35 speckles and SC35 cytoplasmic granules. By contrast, transfection of the same plasmid with Lipofectamine 3000 does not have any effect on SC35 localization. The formation of SC35 cytoplasmic granules by JetPRIME-mediated transfection is independent of exogenous expression by plasmid and although similar in morphology they are distinct from P-bodies and stress granules. This method of transfection affected only SC35 and phosphorylated SR proteins but not the nuclear speckles. The JetPRIME-mediated transfection also showed compromised transcription in cells with enlarged SC35 speckles. Our work indicates that the use of JetPRIME alters SC35 localization and can affect gene expression and alternative splicing. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting results after the use of a transient transfection system, particularly when the subject of the study is the function of a protein in the control of gene expression or mRNA splicing.

Abstract: Protein S-palmitoylation, the covalent lipid modification of the side chain of Cys residues with the 16‑carbon fatty acid palmitate, is the most common acylation, and it enhances the membrane stability of ion channels. This post-translational modification (PTM) determines a functional mechanism of ion channel life cycle from maturation and membrane trafficking to localization. Especially, neurodevelopment is regulated by balancing the level of synaptic protein palmitoylation/depalmitoylation. Recently, we revealed the pathological role of the transient receptor potential canonical type 5 (TRPC5) channel in striatal neuronal loss during Huntington's disease (HD), which is abnormally activated by oxidative stress. Here, we report a mechanism of TRPC5 palmitoylation at a conserved cysteine residue, that is critical for intrinsic channel activity. Furthermore, we identified the therapeutic effect of TRPC5 depalmitoylation by enhancing the TRPC5 membrane instability on HD striatal cells in order to lower TRPC5 toxicity. Collectively, these findings suggest that controlling S-palmitoylation of the TRPC5 channel as a potential risk factor can modulate TRPC5 channel expression and activity, providing new insights into a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Acinar cell exocytosis requires spatiotemporal Ca2+ signals regulated through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, Ca2+ATPases, and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). The secretory pathway Ca2+ATPase 2 (SPCA2) interacts with Orai1, which is involved in SOCE and store independent Ca2+ entry (SICE). However, in the pancreas, only a C-terminally truncated form of SPCA2 (termed SPAC2C) exists. The goal of this study was to determine if SPCA2C effects Ca2+ homeostasis in a similar fashion to the full-length SPCA2. Using epitope-tagged SPCA2C (SPCA2CFLAG) expressed in HEK293A cells and Fura2 imaging, cytosolic [Ca2+] was examined during SICE, SOCE and secretagogue-stimulated signaling. Exogenous SPCA2C expression increased resting cytosolic [Ca2+], Ca2+ release in response to carbachol, ER Ca2+ stores, and store-mediated and independent Ca2+ influx. Co-IP detected Orai1-SPCA2C interaction, which was altered by co-expression of STIM1. Importantly, SPCA2C's effects on store-mediated Ca2+ entry were independent of Orai1. These findings indicate SPCA2C influences Ca2+ homeostasis through multiple mechanisms, some of which are independent of Orai1, suggesting novel and possibly cell-specific Ca2+ regulation.

Abstract: In the innate immune system, the host defense from the invasion of external pathogens triggers the inflammatory responses. Proteins involved in the inflammatory pathways were often found to aggregate into supramolecular oligomers, called ‘inflammasome’, mostly through the homotypic interaction between their domains that belong to the death domain superfamily. Although much has been known about the formation of these helical molecular machineries, the detailed correlation between the dynamics of their assembly and the structure of each domain is still not well understood. Using the filament formed by the PYD domains of adaptor molecule ASC as a test system, we constructed a new multiscale simulation framework to study the kinetics of inflammasome assembly. We found that the filament assembly is a multi-step, but highly cooperative process. Moreover, there are three types of binding interfaces between domain subunits in the ASCPYD filament. The multiscale simulation results suggest that dynamics of domain assembly are rooted in the primary protein sequence which defines the energetics of molecular recognition through three binding interfaces. Interface I plays a more regulatory role than the other two in mediating both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of assembly. Finally, the efficiency of our computational framework allows us to design mutants on a systematic scale and predict their impacts on filament assembly. In summary, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first simulation method to model the spatial-temporal process of inflammasome assembly. Our work is a useful addition to a suite of existing experimental techniques to study the functions of inflammasome in innate immune system.

Abstract: Lipoproteins have a vital role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases ranging from protective to deleterious effects on target tissues. VLDL has been shown to induce lipotoxic lipid accumulation and exert a variety of negative effects on cardiomyocytes. Lipotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are proposed to be the mediators of damaging effects of metabolic diseases on cardiovascular system. We treated cardiomyocytes with lipoproteins to evaluate the adaptability of these cells to metabolic stress induced by starvation and excess of lipoproteins, and to evaluate the effect of lipoproteins and lipid accumulation on ER stress. VLDL reversed metabolic stress induced by starvation, while HDL did not. VLDL induced dose-dependent lipid accumulation in cardiomyocytes, which however did not result in reduced cell viability or induction of ER stress. Moreover, VLDL or HDL pre-treatment reduced ER stress in cardiomyocytes induced by tunicamycin and palmitic acid as measured by the expression of ER stress markers, even in conditions of increased lipid accumulation. VLDL and HDL induced activation of pro-survival ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes; however, this activation was not involved in the protection against ER stress. Additionally, we observed that LDLR and VLDLR are regulated differently by lipoproteins and cellular stress, as lipoproteins induced VLDLR protein independently of the level of lipid accumulation. We conclude that VLDL is not a priori detrimental for cardiomyocytes and can even have beneficial effects, enabling cell survival under starvation and attenuating ER stress.

Abstract: Aberrant fatty acid (FA) metabolism is a hallmark of proliferating cells, including untransformed fibroblasts or cancer cells. Lipolysis of intracellular triglyceride (TG) stores by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) provides an important source of FAs serving as energy substrates, signaling molecules, and precursors for membrane lipids. To investigate if ATGL-mediated lipolysis impacts cell proliferation, we modified ATGL activity in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in five different cancer cell lines to determine the consequences on cell growth and metabolism. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ATGL in MEFs causes impaired FA oxidation, decreased ROS production, and a substrate switch from FA to glucose leading to decreased AMPK-mTOR signaling and higher cell proliferation rates. ATGL expression in these cancer cells is low when compared to MEFs. Additional ATGL knockdown in cancer cells did not significantly affect cellular lipid metabolism or cell proliferation whereas the ectopic overexpression of ATGL increased lipolysis and reduced proliferation. In contrast to ATGL silencing, pharmacological inhibition of ATGL by Atglistatin© impeded the proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines, which points at an ATGL-independent effect. Our data indicate a crucial role of ATGL-mediated lipolysis in the regulation of cell proliferation. The observed low ATGL activity in cancer cells may represent an evolutionary selection process and mechanism to sustain high cell proliferation rates. As the increasing ATGL activity decelerates proliferation of five different cancer cell lines this may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract uncontrolled cell growth.

Abstract: Aims
PPARγ is a crucial transcription factor involved in development of hepatic steatosis, an early stage of NAFLD. PPARγ is tightly regulated through various positive and negative regulators including miRNAs. In this study, we report for the first time miR-3666 as a negative regulator of PPARγ and its involvement in development of hepatic steatosis.
Methods
Binding of miR-3666 to regulate PPARγ was checked by luciferase assay and was confirmed by mutating PPARγ 3′UTR. Regulation of PPARγ was determined by overexpression of miR-3666 in HepG2 cells. Hepatic steatotic state in HepG2 cells was developed by exposure to excess palmitic acid and expression of PPARγ, miR-3666 and some PPARγ target and non-target genes was checked. Involvement of mir-3666 by regulating PPARγ in hepatic steatosis was also examined in liver of HFD fed mice.
Results
On overexpression of miR-3666, PPARγ expression decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Binding of miR-3666 to PPARγ was confirmed as the luciferase activity using pMIR-REPORT with PPARγ 3′UTR decreased in PA treated HepG2 cells overexpressing miR-3666 and remained unchanged when PPARγ 3′UTR was mutated. In PA treated HepG2 cells during development of hepatic steatosis PPARγ was significantly up-regulated concomitant with down-regulation of miR-3666. Overexpression of miR-3666 in these cells decreased the extent of hepatic steatosis. Significant up-regulation of PPARγ and down-regulation of miR-3666 was also observed in liver of HFD fed mice indicating that miR-3666 regulates PPARγ in vivo.
Conclusions
miR-3666 negatively regulates PPARγ by binding to its 3′UTR during development of hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Dot1 enzymes are histone methyltransferases that mono-, di- and trimethylate lysine 79 of histone H3 to affect several nuclear processes. The functions of these different methylation states are still largely unknown. Trypanosomes, which are flagellated protozoa that cause several parasitic diseases, have two Dot1 homologues. Dot1A catalyzes the mono- and dimethylation of lysine 76 during late G2 and mitosis, and Dot1B catalyzes trimethylation, which is a modification found in all stages of the cell cycle. Here, we generated Trypanosoma cruzi lines lacking Dot1B. Deletion of one allele resulted in parasites with increased levels of mono- and dimethylation and a reduction in H3K76me3. In the full knockout (DKO), no trimethylation was observed. Both the DKO and the single knockout (SKO) showed aberrant morphology and decreased growth due to cell cycle arrest after G2. This phenotype could be rescued by caffeine in the DKO, as caffeine is a checkpoint inhibitor of the cell cycle. The knockouts also phosphorylated γH2A without producing extensive DNA breaks, and Dot1B-depleted cells were more susceptible to general checkpoint kinase inhibitors, suggesting that a lack of H3K76 trimethylation prevents the initiation and/or completion of cytokinesis.

Abstract: Proteins residing in lipid droplets (LDs) of organisms exhibit diverse physiological roles. Since the LD proteins of yeasts are largely unexplored, we have identified a putative LD protein gene, CtLDP1 in the oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 and characterized its function. The increased lipid accumulation in SY005 could be correlated with enhanced (~2.67-fold) expression of the CtLDP1 after low-nitrogen stress. The N-terminal transmembrane domain similar to perilipin proteins and the amphipathic α-helices predicted in silico, presumably aid in targeting the CtLDP1 to LD membranes. Heterologous expression of CtLDP1-mCherry fusion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed localization in LDs, yet the expression of CtLDP1 did not show significant effect on LD formation in transformed cells. Molecular docking showed favourable interactions of the protein with sterol class of molecules, but not with triacylglycerol (TAG); and this was further experimentally verified by co-localization of the mCherry-tagged protein in TAG-deficient (but steryl ester containing) LDs. While oleic acid supplementation caused coalescence of LDs into supersized ones (average diameter = 1.19 ± 0.12 μm; n = 160), this effect was suppressed due to CtLDP1 expression, and the cells mostly exhibited numerous smaller LDs (average diameter = 0.46 ± 0.05 μm; n = 160). Moreover, CtLDP1 expression in pet10Δ knockout strain of S. cerevisiae restored multiple LD formation, indicating functional complementation of the protein. Overall, this study documents functional characterization of an LD-stabilizing protein from an oleaginous strain of Candida genus for the first time, and provides insights on the characteristics of LD proteins in oleaginous yeasts for future metabolic engineering.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are key organelles in cancer cells proliferation, growth, and response to stress. These nanometric structures can aggregate to reach the size of microns becoming important cell components. Although it is known that LDs contain various lipids, their chemical composition is still under investigation. Moreover, their function in cell's response to exogenous factors is also not fully understood. Raman spectroscopy, together with chemometrics, has been shown to be a powerful tool for analytical analyses of cancer cell components on the subcellular level. It provides the opportunity to analyse LDs in a label-free manner in live cells. In the current study, this method was applied to investigate LDs composition in untreated and irradiated with X-ray beams prostate cancer cells. Raman mapping technique proved lipids accumulation in PC-3 cells and allowed visualization of LDs spatial distribution in cytoplasm. A heterogeneous composition of LDs was revealed by detailed analysis of Raman spectra. Interestingly, PC-3 cells were found to accumulate either triacylglycerols or cholesteryl esters. Finally, effect of X-ray radiation on the cells was investigated using Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence staining. Significant influence of LDs in the process of cell response was confirmed and time dependence of this phenomenon was determined.

Abstract: Background
Increased body iron stores have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. The liver plays a central role in homeostasis of iron and glucose in the body. Mice deficient in hepcidin (the central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis) (Hamp1−/− mice) accumulate iron in the liver in vivo. The effects of such iron loading on hepatic insulin signaling and glucose metabolism are not known.
Methods
Hepatocytes isolated from Hamp1−/− mice were studied for markers of insulin signaling (and its downstream effects), glucose production, expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymes, and markers of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activation and oxidative stress. These parameters were studied both in the absence and presence of insulin, and also with the use of an iron chelator.
Results
Akt in the insulin signaling pathway was found to be activated in the Hamp1−/− hepatocytes to a greater extent than wild-type (WT) cells, both under basal conditions and in response to insulin. Incubation of the Hamp1−/− hepatocytes with an iron chelator attenuated these effects. There was no evidence of oxidative stress or AMPK activation in the Hamp1−/− hepatocytes. Glucose production by these cells was similar to that by WT cells. Gene expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes was decreased in these cells. In addition, they showed evidence of increased lipogenesis.
Conclusions
Hepatocytes from Hamp1−/− mice showed evidence of greater sensitivity to the effects of insulin than WT hepatocytes. This may explain the insulin-sensitive phenotype that has been reported in classical hemochromatosis.

Abstract: Except for epidermis and liver, little is known about endogenous expression of 1-O-acylceramides (1-OACs) in mammalian tissue. Therefore, we screened several organs (brain, lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, kidney, thymus, small intestine, and colon) from mice for the presence of 1-OACs by LC-MS2. In most organs, low levels of about 0.25–1.3 pmol 1-OACs/mg wet weight were recorded. Higher levels were detected in liver, small and large intestines, with about 4–13 pmol 1-OACs/mg wet weight. 1-OACs were esterified mainly with palmitic, stearic, or oleic acids. Esterification with saturated very long-chain fatty acids, as in epidermis, was not observed. Western-type diet induced 3-fold increased 1-OAC levels in mice livers while ceramides were unaltered. In a mouse model of Farber disease with a decrease of acid ceramidase activity, we observed a strong, up to 50-fold increase of 1-OACs in lung, thymus, and spleen. In contrast, 1-OAC levels were reduced 0.54-fold in liver. Only in lung 1-OAC levels correlated to changes in ceramide levels - indicating tissue-specific mechanisms of regulation. Glucosylceramide synthase deficiency in liver did not cause changes in 1-OAC or ceramide levels, whereas increased ceramide levels in glucosylceramide synthase-deficient small intestine caused an increase in 1-OAC levels. Deficiency of Dgat1 in mice resulted in a reduction of 1-OACs to 30% in colon, but not in small intestine and liver, going along with constant free ceramides levels. From these data, we conclude that Dgat1 as well as lysosomal lipid metabolism contribute in vivo to homeostatic 1-OAC levels in an organ-specific manner.

Abstract: Background & aims
Neurotensin (NTS), a 13-aminoacid peptide localized in central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, is involved in lipid metabolism and promotes various cancers onset mainly by binding to neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). Increased plasma levels of pro-NTS, the stable NTS precursor, have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). We aimed to evaluate 1) the impact of NTS rs1800832 and NTSR1 rs6090453 genetic variants on liver damage in 1166 MAFLD European individuals, 2) the relation between NTS variant and circulating pro-NTS and 3) the hepatic NTS expression by RNAseq transcriptomic analysis in 125 bariatric patients.
Results
The NTS rs1800832 G allele was associated with hepatic fibrosis (OR 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI). 1.02–1.58; p = 0.03), even more in carriers of both NTS and NTSR1 G risk alleles (OR 1.17, 95% CI. 1.03–1.34; p = 0.01), with cirrhosis (OR 1.58, 95% CI. 1.07–2.34; p = 0.02) and HCC (OR 1.98, 95% CI. 1.24–3.2; p = 0.004). Pro-NTS circulating levels were correlated with T2D (p = 0.005), BMI, (p = 0.04), age (p = 0.0016), lobular inflammation (p = 0.0025), fibrosis>2 (p < 0.0001), cirrhosis (p = 0.0009) and HCC (p < 0.0001) and more so after stratification for the NTS G allele. Transcriptomic data showed that hepatic NTS expression correlated with that of fibrogenic genes (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
NTS rs1800832 variant is associated with advanced fibrosis and HCC in MAFLD patients likely affecting NTS protein activity. The rs6090453 NTSR1 gene variant synergizes with NTS rs1800832 mutation to promote liver damage. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm NTS role in liver disease progression.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prognosis still remains poor and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Studies demonstrate the importance of the EGFR/HER-receptor family in NSCLC growth, as well as that of other tumors. Recently, HER3 is receiving increased attention because of its role in drug resistance and aggressive growth. Activation of overexpressed G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) can also initiate growth by transactivating EGFR/HER-family members. GPCR transactivation of EGFR has been extensively studied, but little is known of its ability to transactivate other EGFR/HER-members, especially HER3. To address this, we studied the ability of bombesin receptor (BnR) activation to transactivate all EGFR/HER-family members and their principal downstream signaling cascades, the PI3K/Akt- and MAPK/ERK-pathways, in human NSCLC cell-lines. In all three cell-lines studied, which possessed EGFR, HER2 and HER3, Bn rapidly transactivated EGFR, HER2 and HER3, as well as Akt and ERK. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed Bn-induced formation of both HER3/EGFR- and HER3/HER2-heterodimers. Specific EGFR/HER3 antibodies or siRNA-knockdown of EGFR and HER3, demonstrated Bn-stimulated activation of EGFR/HER members is initially through HER3, not EGFR. In addition, specific inhibition of HER3, HER2 or MAPK, abolished Bn-stimulated cell-growth, while neither EGFR nor Akt inhibition had an effect. These results show HER3 transactivation mediates all growth effects of BnR activation through MAPK. These results raise the possibility that targeting HER3 alone or with GPCR activation and its signal cascades, may be a novel therapeutic approach in NSCLC. This is especially relevant with the recent development of HER3-blocking antibodies.

Abstract: The regulation of porcine subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) fat deposition significantly affects pork quality and the lean meat percentage of the carcass, respectively. The adipokine C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 6 (CTRP6), plays a significant role in regulating animal fat deposition. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of CTRP6 gene knockdown in IM and SC adipocytes by RNA-seq analysis. A total of 1830 and 2936 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in SC and IM adipocytes, respectively. 844 were down- and 2092 were upregulated in SC adipocytes, while 648 were down- and 1182 were upregulated in IM adipocytes. Furthermore, 1778 DEGs were detected only in SC adipocytes, 672 DEGs only in IM adipocytes, and 1158 DEGs in both types of adipocytes. GO analysis indicated that DEGs involved in adipocyte differentiation were significantly enriched in both SC and IM adipocytes following treatment with CTRP6-siRNA. Moreover, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed differences of metabolic regulation between IM and SC adipocytes. With CTRP6-silencing, the signaling pathways related to Ras and arachidonic acid metabolism were significantly enriched in IM adipocytes, while four other signaling pathways, encompassing the TNF, MAPK, p53 and adipokine pathway were specifically enriched in SC adipocytes. Interestingly, the effect of CTRP6-siRNA treatment was attenuated by the specific Ras activator ML-097 in IM adipocytes, while the specific p53 activator SJ-172550 had the corresponding effect in SC adipocytes. Altogether, we suggest that CTRP6 may be a differential regulator of the development and metabolism of IM and SC adipose tissues.

Abstract: Spexin (SPX) is a novel adipokine related to many metabolic effects, such as gastrointestinal movements, insulin and glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and energy balance. This study evaluates the role of SPX in the improvement of the metabolic and inflammatory profile in fructose-rich-diet obese mice. Adult Swiss mice were supplemented or not with fructose (20% in tap water, FRD and CTR, respectively) for 10 weeks. The last ten days, mice were treated or not with SPX (ip. 29 μg/Kg/day, FRD-SPX and CTR-SPX, respectively). A positive correlation was observed between body weight prior to treatment and weight loss after SPX challenge. Moreover, plasma and liver triglycerides and adipose tissue (AT) features (mass, adipocyte hypertrophy, mRNA of leptin) were improved. SPX also induced a reduction in epididymal AT (EAT) expression of TNFα, IL1β and IL6 and an improvement in IL10 and CD206. M1 macrophages in EAT, principally the Ly6C− populations (M1a and M1b), were decreased. Adipocytes from FRD-SPX mice induced less macrophage activation (IL6, mRNA and secretion) than FRD after overnight co-culture with the monocyte cell line (RAW264.7) in stimulated conditions (M1 activation, LPS 100 ng/mL). Finally, in vitro, monocytes pre-incubated with SPX and stimulated with LPS showed decreased inflammatory mRNA markers compared to monocytes with LPS alone. In conclusion, SPX decreased body weight and improved the metabolic profile and adipocyte hypertrophy. Inflammatory Ly6C− macrophages decreased, together with inflammatory marker expression. In vitro studies demonstrate that SPX induced a decrease in M1 macrophage polarization directly or through mature adipocytes.

Evidence of nuclear transport mechanisms in the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia,

Abstract: Nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins is a highly regulated process that modulates multiple biological processes in eukaryotic cells. In Giardia lamblia, shuttling has been described from the cytoplasm to nuclei of proteins during the biological cell cycle of the parasite. This suggests that a mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport is present and functional in G. lamblia. By means of computational biology analyses, we found that there are only two genes for nuclear transport in this parasite, named Importin α and Importin β. When these transporters were overexpressed, both localized close to the nuclear envelope, and no change was observed in trophozoite growth rate. However, during the encystation process, both transporters induced an increase in the number of cysts produced. Importazole and Ivermectin, two known specific inhibitors of importins, separately influenced the encysting process by inducing an arrest in the trophozoite stage that prevents the production of cysts. This effect was more noticeable when Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, was used. Finally, we tested whether the enzyme arginine deiminase, which shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nuclei during encystation, was influenced by these transporters. We found that treatment with each of the inhibitors abrogates arginine deiminase nuclear translocation and favors perinuclear localization. This suggests that Importin α and Importin β are key transporters during the encystation process and are involved, at least, in the transport of arginine deiminase into the nuclei. Considering the effect produced by Ivermectin during growth and encystation, we postulate that this drug could be used to treat giardiasis.

Abstract: Endoparasitoid wasps inject venom along with their eggs to adjust the physiological and nutritional environment inside their hosts to benefit the development of their offspring. In particular, wasp venoms are known to modify host lipid metabolism, lipid storage in the fat body, and release of lipids into the hemolymph, but how venoms accomplish these functions remains unclear. Here, we use an UPLC-MS-based lipidomics approach to analyze the identities and concentrations of lipids in both fat body and hemolymph of host cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) infected by the pupal endoparasitoid Pteromalus puparum. During infection, host fat body levels of highly unsaturated, soluble triacylglycerides (TAGs) increased while less unsaturated, less soluble forms decreased. Furthermore, in infected host hemolymph, overall levels of TAG and phospholipids (the major component of cell membranes) increased, suggesting that fat body cells are destroyed and their contents are dispersed. Altogether, these data suggest that wasp venom induces host fat body TAGs to be transformed into lower melting point (more liquid) forms and released into the host hemolymph following infection, allowing simple absorption and nutritional acquisition by wasp larvae. Finally, cholesteryl esters (CEs, a dietary lipid derived from cholesterol) increased in host hemolymph following infection with no concomitant decrease in host cholesterol, implying that the wasp may provide this necessary food resource to its offspring via its venom. This study provides novel insight into how parasitoid infection alters lipid metabolism in insect hosts, and begins to uncover the wasp venom proteins responsible for host physiological changes and offspring development.

Abstract: Cardiac aging affects the heart on the functional, structural, and molecular level and shares characteristic hallmarks with the development of chronic heart failure. Apart from age-dependent left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis that impairs diastolic function, diminished activity of cardiac protein-quality-control systems increases the risk of cytotoxic accumulation of defective proteins. Here, we studied the impact of cardiac aging on the sarcomeric protein titin by analyzing titin-based cardiomyocyte passive tension, titin modification and proteasomal titin turnover. We analyzed left ventricular samples from young (6 months) and old (20 months) wild-type mice and healthy human donor patients grouped according to age in young (17–50 years) and aged hearts (51–73 years). We found no age-dependent differences in titin isoform composition of mouse or human hearts. In aged hearts from mice and human we determined altered titin phosphorylation at serine residues S4010 and S4099 in the elastic N2B domain, but no significant changes in phosphorylation of S11878 and S12022 in the elastic PEVK region. Importantly, overall titin-based cardiomyocyte passive tension remained unchanged. In aged hearts, the calcium-activated protease calpain-1, which provides accessibility to ubiquitination by releasing titin from the sarcomere, showed decreased proteolytic activity. In addition, we observed a reduction in the proteasomal activities. Taken together, our data indicate that cardiac aging does not affect titin-based passive properties of the cardiomyocytes, but impairs protein-quality control, including titin, which may result in a diminished adaptive capacity of the aged myocardium.

Abstract: Exocytosis of spermatozoon's secretory vesicle, named acrosome reaction (AR), is a regulated event that plays a central role in fertilization. It is coupled to a complex calcium signaling. Ceramide is a multitasking lipid involved in exocytosis. Nevertheless, its effect on secretion is controversial and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Human spermatozoa are useful to dissect the role of ceramide in secretion given that the gamete is not capable to undergo any trafficking mechanisms other than exocytosis. We report for the first time, the presence of sphingolipid metabolism enzymes such as neutral-sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthase in sperm. Ceramidases are also present and active. Both the addition of cell-permeable ceramide and the rise of the endogenous one, increase intracellular calcium acting as potent inducers of exocytosis. Ceramide triggers AR in capacitated spermatozoa and enhances the gamete response to progesterone. The lipid induces physiological ultrastructural changes in the acrosome and triggers an exocytosis-signaling cascade involving protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and VAMP2. Real-time imaging showed an increment of calcium in the cytosol upon ceramide treatment either in the absence or in the presence of extracellular calcium. Pharmacological experiments demonstrate that at early stages the process involves ryanodine receptors, CatSper (calcium channel of sperm), and store-operated calcium channels. We set out the signaling sequence of events that connect ceramide to internal calcium mobilization and external calcium signals during secretion. These results allow the coordination of lipids and proteins in a pathway that accomplishes secretion. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ceramide's role in regulated exocytosis and fertilization.

Abstract: Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into highly condensed chromatin and this repressive chromatin barrier can be overcome by altering the chromatin structure via histone modification enzymes. Here, we report Wdr70 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (spWdr70) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes including cell cycle progression, chromatin structure and DNA repair. Depletion of Wdr70 gene causes cell cycle delay, hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents and quick phenotypic changes. Moreover, we observed strong genetic interaction between Wdr70 and genes regulating checkpoint and homologous recombination (HR), pinpointing the function of Wdr70 to DNA end resection. Finally, we show that the function of Wdr70 could be attributed to monoubiquitination of histone H2B (uH2B) in the vicinity of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Taken together, our data reveal that Wdr70 and H2B monoubiquitination-dependent chromatin modulation is required for chromatin homeostasis and genetic stability.

Abstract: Dose-dependent lipid accumulation was induced by glucose in HepG2 cells. GlcN also exerted a promotory effect on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions (NG, 5 mM) and liver of normal fed zebrafish larvae. High glucose (HG, 25 mM)-induced lipid accumulation was suppressed by l-glutamine-d-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitors. ER stress inhibitors did not suppress HG or GlcN-mediated lipid accumulation. HG and GlcN stimulated protein expression, DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Furthermore, both HG and GlcN increased nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) levels in HepG2 cells. In contrast to its stimulatory effect under NG, GlcN suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under HG conditions. Similarly, GlcN suppressed lipid accumulation in livers of overfed zebrafish. In addition, GlcN activity on DNA binding and O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP was stimulatory under NG and inhibitory under HG conditions. Moreover, GlcN enhanced ChREBP, SREBP-1c, ACC, FAS, L-PK and SCD-1 mRNA expression under NG but inhibited HG-induced upregulation in HepG2 cells. The O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor, alloxan, reduced lipid accumulation by HG or GlcN while the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, PUGNAc, enhanced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and liver of zebrafish larvae. GlcN-induced lipid accumulation was inhibited by the AMPK activator, AICAR. Phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was suppressed by GlcN under NG while increased by GlcN under HG. PUGNAc downregulated p-AMPK while alloxan restored GlcN- or HG-induced p-AMPK inhibition. Our results collectively suggest that GlcN regulates lipogenesis by sensing the glucose or energy states of normal and excess fuel through AMPK modulation.

Abstract: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) binding to arterial proteoglycans initiates LDL retention and modification in the arterial wall, triggering atherosclerosis. The details of this binding, its effectors, and its ramifications are incompletely understood. We combined heparin affinity chromatography with biochemical, spectroscopic and electron microscopic techniques to show that brief binding to heparin initiates irreversible pro-atherogenic remodeling of human LDL. This involved decreased structural stability of LDL and increased susceptibility to hydrolysis, oxidation and fusion. Furthermore, phospholipid hydrolysis, mild oxidation and/or glycation of LDL in vitro increase the proteolytic susceptibility of apoB and its heparin binding affinity, perhaps by unmasking additional heparin-binding sites. For LDL from hyperglycemic type-2 diabetic patients, heparin binding was particularly destabilizing and caused apoB fragmentation and LDL fusion. However, for similar patients whose glycemic control was restored upon therapy, LDL-heparin binding affinity was rectified and LDL structural stability was partially restored. These results complement previous studies of LDL binding to arterial proteoglycans and suggest that such interactions may produce a particularly pro-atherogenic subclass of electronegative LDL. In summary, binding to heparin alters apoB conformation, perhaps by partially peeling it off the lipid, and triggers pro-atherogenic LDL modifications including hydrolysis, oxidation, and destabilization. Furthermore, phospholipid lipolysis, mild oxidation and glycation of LDL in vitro strengthen its binding to heparin, which helps explain stronger binding observed in hyperglycemic LDL. Combined effects of hyperglycemia and heparin binding are especially deleterious but are largely rectified upon diabetes therapy. These findings help establish a mechanistic link between diabetes and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Inflammation is a tightly regulated process. During the past decade it has become clear that the resolution of inflammation is an active process and its dysregulation can contribute to chronic inflammation. Several cells and soluble mediators, including lipid mediators, regulate the course of inflammation and its resolution. It is, however, unclear which signals and cells are involved in initiating the resolution process. Macrophages are tissue resident cells and key players in regulating tissue inflammation through secretion of soluble mediators, including lipids. We hypothesize that persistent inflammatory stimuli can initiate resolution pathways in macrophages. In this study, we detected 21 lipids in LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived macrophages by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Cyclooxygenase-derived Prostaglandins were observed in the first six hours of stimulation. Interestingly, a switch towards 15-lipoxygenase products, such as the pro-resolving lipid precursors 15-HEPE and 17-HDHA was observed after 24 h. The RNA and protein expression of cyclooxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase were in line with this trend. Treatment with 17-HDHA increased IL-10 production of monocyte-derived macrophages and decreased LTB4 production by neutrophils, indicating the anti-inflammatory property of this lipid. These data reveal that monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the resolution of inflammation in time by the production of pro-resolving lipids after an initial inflammatory stimulus.

Abstract: Artemisinin and its derivatives kill malaria parasites and inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. In both processes, heme was shown to play a key role in artemisinin bioactivation. We found that artemisinin and clinical artemisinin derivatives are able to compensate for a mutation in the yeast Bcs1 protein, a key chaperon involved in biogenesis of the mitochondrial respiratory complex III. The equivalent Bcs1 variant causes an encephalopathy in human by affecting complex III assembly. We show that artemisinin derivatives decrease the content of mitochondrial cytochromes and disturb the maturation of the complex III cytochrome c1. This last effect is likely responsible for the compensation by decreasing the detrimental over-accumulation of the inactive pre-complex III observed in the bcs1 mutant. We further show that a fluorescent dihydroartemisinin probe rapidly accumulates in the mitochondrial network and targets cytochromes c and c1 in yeast, human cells and isolated mitochondria. In vitro this probe interacts with purified cytochrome c only under reducing conditions and we detect cytochrome c-dihydroartemisinin covalent adducts by mass spectrometry analyses. We propose that reduced mitochondrial c-type cytochromes act as both targets and mediators of artemisinin bioactivation in yeast and human cells.

Abstract: Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease of the ocular surface characterized by tear film instability, hyperosmolarity, cell damage and inflammation. Hyperosmolarity is strongly established as the core mechanism of the DED. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) - a quaternary ammonium salt commonly used in eye drops for its microbicidal properties - is well known to favor the onset of DED. Currently, little data are available regarding lipid metabolism alteration in ocular surface epithelial cells in the course of DED. Our aim was to explore the effects of benzalkonium chloride or hyperosmolarity exposure on the human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell lipidome, two different conditions used as in vitro models of DED. For this purpose, we performed a lipidomic analysis using UPLC-HRMS-ESI+/−. Our results demonstrated that BAK or hyperosmolarity induced important modifications in HCE lipidome including major changes in sphingolipids, glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. For both exposures, an increase in ceramide was especially exhibited. Hyperosmolarity specifically induced triglyceride accumulation resulting in lipid droplet formation. Conversely, BAK induced an increase in lysophospholipids and a decrease in phospholipids. This lipidomic study highlights the lipid changes involved in inflammatory responses following BAK or hyperosmolarity exposures. Thereby, lipid research appears of great interest, as it could lead to the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of dry eye disease.

Abstract: Iron is a vital micronutrient for all eukaryotes because it participates as a redox cofactor in multiple metabolic pathways, including lipid biosynthesis. In response to iron deficiency, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1 accumulates in the nucleus and activates a set of genes that promote iron acquisition at the cell surface. In this study, we report that yeast cells lacking the transcription factor Mga2, which promotes the expression of the iron-dependent Δ9-fatty acid desaturase Ole1, display a defect in the activation of the iron regulon during the adaptation to iron limitation. Supplementation with exogenous unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) or OLE1 expression rescues the iron regulon activation defect of mga2Δ cells. These observations and fatty acid measurements suggest that the mga2Δ defect in iron regulon expression is due to low UFA levels. Subcellular localization studies reveal that low UFAs cause a mislocalization of Aft1 protein to the vacuole upon iron deprivation that prevents its nuclear accumulation. These results indicate that Mga2 and Ole1 are essential to maintain the UFA levels required for Aft1-dependent activation of the iron regulon in response to iron deficiency, and directly connect the biosynthesis of fatty acids to the response to iron depletion.

Abstract: Alternative splicing within a gene can create different versions of an mRNA, called isoforms. CFIm, composed of a small subunit CFIm25 and two large subunits CFIm68 and CFIm59 (also known as CPSF7), has been proposed as an enhancer-dependent activator of mRNA 3′ processing. In this study, we investigated the role of CPSF7 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Experimental evidence suggests that the expression level of CPSF7 is higher in liver cancer cells and tissues than in non-tumor hepatic cells and tissues. Furthermore, knockdown of CPSF7 effectively suppressed cell proliferation, migration and colony formation in liver cancer cells by inhibiting PTEN/AKT signaling. CPSF7 promoted WWP2-FL due to the presence of PTEN ubiquitination sites in this longer transcript. Taken together, we identified that CPSF7 regulates liver cancer growth by targeting WWP2-FL that in turn regulates AKT activation in a PTEN-dependent manner.

Abstract: Platelet 12-lipoxygenase(p-12-LOX) is highly expressed in human platelets, and the development of p-12-LOX inhibitors has the potential to be a novel antithrombotic tool by inhibiting thrombosis without prolonging hemostasis. A chiral liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) method was used to assess the impact of three commercially available LOX inhibitors[esculetin(6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), ML-355(N-2-benzothiazolyl-4-[[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]amino]-benzenesulfonamide), CDC(cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate) and acetylsalicylic acid(ASA; a cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor) on the generation of prostanoids and HETEs(hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids) in human whole blood allowed to clot for 1 h at 37 °C(serum), platelet-rich plasma(PRP) stimulated with collagen or TRAP-6(a peptide activating thrombin receptor) and washed platelets. In serum, ML-355 did not affect eicosanoid generation, while CDC caused an incomplete reduction of 12S-HETE levels; esculetin inhibited both 12S-HETE and thromboxane(TX)B2 production; ASA selectively affected TXB2 production. In washed platelets stimulated with thrombin, esculetin, and CDC inhibited both 12S-HETE and TXB2 while ML-355 was almost ineffective. In PRP, ML-355, CDC, and esculetin did not affect platelet aggregation associated with incomplete effects on eicosanoid biosynthesis. ASA alone or in combination with ticagrelor(a P2Y12 blocker) affected platelet aggregation associated with profound inhibition of TXB2 generation. P2Y12 receptor signaling contributed to platelet 12S-HETE biosynthesis in response to primary agonists. In conclusion, ML-355, esculetin, and CDC were not selective inhibitors of p-12-LOX in different cellular systems. They did not affect platelet aggregation induced in PRP by collagen or TRAP-6. The characterization of 12-LOX inhibitors on eicosanoids generated in human whole blood is useful for information on their enzyme selectivity, off-target effects, and the possible influence of plasma components on their pharmacological effects.

Abstract: The non-activating allosteric modulator AZ1729, specific for free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), transfers the orthosteric FFAR2 agonists propionate and the P2Y2R specific agonist ATP into activating ligands that trigger an assembly of the neutrophil superoxide generating NADPH-oxidase. The homologous priming effect on the propionate response and the heterologous receptor cross-talk sensitized ATP response mediated by AZ1729 are functional characteristics shared with Cmp58, another non-activating allosteric FFAR2 modulator. In addition, AZ1729 also turned Cmp58 into a potent activator of the superoxide generating neutrophil NADPH-oxidase, and in agreement with the allosteric modulation concept, the effect was reciprocal in that Cmp58 turned AZ1729 into a potent activating allosteric agonist. The activation signals down-stream of FFAR2 when stimulated by the two interdependent allosteric modulators were biased in that, unlike for orthosteric agonists, the two complementary modulators together triggered an activation of the NADPH-oxidase, but not any transient rise in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions (Ca2+). Furthermore, following AZ1729/Cmp58 activation, the signaling by the desensitized FFAR2s was functionally selective in that the orthosteric agonist propionate could still induce a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+. The novel neutrophil activation and receptor down-stream signaling pattern mediated by the two cross-sensitizing allosteric FFAR2 modulators represent a new regulatory mechanism that controls receptor signaling.

Abstract: In mast cells (MCs), the TEC family kinase (TFK) BTK constitutes a central regulator of antigen (Ag)-triggered, FcεRI-mediated PLCγ phosphorylation, Ca2+ mobilization, degranulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Less is known about the function of BTK in the context of stem cell factor (SCF)-induced KIT signaling. In bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs), Ag stimulation caused intense phosphorylation of BTK at Y551 in its active center and at Y223 in its SH3-domain, whereas in response to SCF only Y223 was significantly phosphorylated. Further data using the TFK inhibitor Ibrutinib indicated that BTK Y223 is phosphorylated by a non-BTK TFK upon SCF stimulation. In line, SCF-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation was stronger attenuated by Ibrutinib than by BTK deficiency. Subsequent pharmacological analysis of PLCγ function revealed a total block of SCF-induced Ca2+ mobilization by PLC inhibition, whereas only the sustained phase of Ca2+ flux was curtailed in Ag-stimulated BMMCs. Despite this severe stimulus-dependent difference in inducing Ca2+ mobilization, PLCγ inhibition suppressed Ag- and SCF-induced degranulation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production to comparable extents, suggesting involvement of additional TFK(s) or PLCγ-dependent signaling components. In addition to PLCγ, the MAPKs p38 and JNK were activated by Ag in a BTK-dependent manner; this was not observed upon SCF stimulation. Hence, FcεRI and KIT employ different mechanisms for activating PLCγ, p38, and JNK, which might strengthen their cooperation regarding pro-inflammatory MC effector functions. Importantly, our data clearly demonstrate that analyzing BTK Y223 phosphorylation is not sufficient to prove BTK activation.

Abstract: The sea urchin embryo develops a well-defined biomineralized endoskeleton, synthesized exclusively by the skeletogenic cells, supported by ectodermal cues for the correct skeleton patterning. The biomineralization process is tightly regulated via a hierarchical order of gene expression, including transcription and growth factors, biomineralization proteins. Recently, the role of kinases and intracellular signaling pathways in sea urchin skeletogenesis has been addressed, although the downstream components still remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling pathway in Paracentrotus lividus, to identify its genes/proteins targets. The effects of LY294002 (LY), a PI3K-specific inhibitor, were evaluated at morphological and molecular levels. Treatment with 40 μM LY from the blastula stage completely blocked skeleton deposition, which was reversed by wash out experiments. Besides, LY caused a slight delay in the tripartite gut development. Despite the skeleton absence, a few skeleton-specific proteins/mRNAs were regularly expressed and localized in LY-treated embryos, as shown for MSP130 and SM50 by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization experiments. QPCR analyses showed that LY differently affected the expression of genes coding for other biomineralization proteins, transcription and growth factors. SM30 and carbonic anhydrase expression was severely downregulated, while almost all the transcription factors analyzed were upregulated. Based on the present results and in silico analyses, we propose an “interactomic” model simulating PI3K connections in P. lividus embryos. Our findings define a novel regulatory step in the embryonic skeletogenesis, and provide valuable molecular data for further studies on the role of PI3K signaling in invertebrate biomineralization.

Abstract: We have established an experimental system for the functional analysis of thylakoidal TatB, a component of the membrane-integral TatBC receptor complex of the thylakoidal Twin-arginine protein transport (Tat) machinery. For this purpose, the intrinsic TatB activity of isolated pea thylakoids was inhibited by affinity-purified antibodies and substituted by supplementing the assays with TatB protein either obtained by in vitro translation or purified after heterologous expression in E. coli. Tat transport activity of such reconstituted thylakoids, which was analysed with the authentic Tat substrate pOEC16, reached routinely 20–25% of the activity of mock-treated thylakoid vesicles analysed in parallel. In contrast, supplementation of the assays with the purified antigen comprising all but the N-terminal transmembrane helix of thylakoidal TatB did not result in Tat transport reconstitution which confirms that transport relies strictly on the activity of the TatB protein added and is not due to restoration of the intrinsic TatB activity by antibody release. Unexpectedly, even a mutated TatB protein (TatB,E10C) assumed to be incapable of assembling into the TatBC receptor complex showed low but considerable transport reconstitution underlining the sensitivity of the approach and its suitability for further functional analyses of protein variants. Finally, quantification of TatB demand suggests that TatA and TatB are required in approximately equimolar amounts to achieve Tat-dependent thylakoid transport.

Abstract: During stress conditions such as pressure overload and acute ischemia, the myocardial endothelium releases neuregulin-1β (NRG-1), which acts as a cardioprotective factor and supports recovery of the heart. Recently, we demonstrated that recombinant human (rh)NRG-1 enhances glucose uptake in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes via the ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimer and PI3Kα. The present study aimed to further elucidate the mechanism whereby rhNRG-1 activates glucose uptake in comparison to the well-established insulin and to extend the findings to adult models. Combinations of rhNRG-1 with increasing doses of insulin did not yield any additive effect on glucose uptake measured as 3H-deoxy-d-glucose incorporation, indicating that the mechanisms of the two stimuli are similar. In c-Myc-GLUT4-mCherry-transfected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, rhNRG-1 increased sarcolemmal GLUT4 by 16-fold, similar to insulin. In contrast to insulin, rhNRG-1 did not phosphorylate IRS-1 at Tyr612, indicating that IRS-1 is not implicated in the signal transmission. Treatment of neonatal rats with rhNRG-1 induced a signaling response comparable with that observed in vitro, including increased ErbB4-pTyr1284, Akt-pThr308 and Erk1/2-pThr202/Tyr204. In contrast, in adult cardiomyocytes rhNRG-1 only increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 without having any significant effect on Akt and AS160 phosphorylation and glucose uptake, suggesting that rhNRG-1 function in neonatal cardiomyocytes differs from that in adult cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our results show that similar to insulin, rhNRG-1 can induce glucose uptake by activating the PI3Kα-Akt-AS160 pathway and GLUT4 translocation. Unlike insulin, the rhNRG-1-induced effect is not mediated by IRS proteins and is observed in neonatal, but not in adult rat cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Splicing is a fundamental RNA-processing step for eukaryotic gene expression involved in the removal of intronic sequences of pre-mRNA. As the process is utilized for quantitative and qualitative regulation of gene expression, uncontrolled splicing can result in potential cellular dysfunctions. Accumulating evidence suggests that fidelity of splicing is regulated by a family of DEAD/DExH-box RNA helicases. Recently, we have shown that the evolutionarily-conserved ubiquitin-relative Hub1 binds directly to the DEAD-box RNA helicase Prp5, a key regulator of splicing fidelity, and stimulates its ATPase activity. When overexpressed, Hub1 enhances splicing efficiency and relaxes the constraints on splice-site and branch-site usages; yet physiological relevance of cellular Hub1 overexpression remains unknown. Here we show that Hub1 is upregulated at the transcriptional level via the yeast-specific AP1 regulon upon oxidative and heavy metal stresses, and promotes efficient splicing of introns with non-canonical splice-sites. While nonessential for yeast viability, Hub1 becomes important for cadmium tolerance when metallothionein-mediated defense system is impaired. Moreover, mutant variants of other splicing factors also showed a similar cadmium sensitivity, suggesting the role of splicing in facilitating tolerance of heavy metal stress. Taken together, we propose that cells adjust gene expression landscape required for heavy metal detoxification by promoting intron-specific splicing through the stress-induced overexpression of Hub1.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs transcribed from telomeres, known as TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA), are associated with telomere and genome stability. TERRA abundance responds to different cell stresses; however, no studies have focused on oxidative stress, condition that damages biomolecules and is involved in aging and disease. Since telomeres are prone to oxidative damage leading to their dysfunction, our objective was to characterize TERRAs and the mechanisms that control their expression. TERRA increased in cells exposed to H2O2 and reverted by antioxidant treatment. TERRAs are also induced in brown adipose tissue of mice exposed to cold, which raises mitochondrial ROS. In cells exposed to H2O2, ChIP showed that chromatin landscape was modified favoring telomere transcription. TERRAs interacted with HP1α/γ, proteins that were found recruited to subtelomeres. Since HP1γ interacts with the transcriptional machinery, TERRAs may stimulate their own expression by recruiting HP1γ to subtelomeres. TERRA induction reverted within 2 h after removal of H2O2 from culture medium, suggesting they have protective functions. This was supported by rapid TERRA induction following a second H2O2 challenge. PKA inhibitors H89 and PKI blocked TERRA increase by H2O2 or IBMX+Forskolin treatment, suggesting PKA signaling regulates TERRA induction. Treatment of cells with drugs that disturb cytoskeleton integrity or growing cells on surfaces of different stiffness known to generate differential cytoskeleton tension also modified TERRA levels and sensitized cells to lower H2O2 concentrations. In summary, we show that TERRAs are induced in response to oxidative stress and are regulated by PKA as well as by changes in cytoskeleton dynamics.

Abstract: Olesoxime is a cholesterol-like neuroprotective compound that targets to mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channels (VDACs). VDACs were also found in the plasma membrane and highly expressed in the presynaptic compartment. Here, we studied the effects of olesoxime and VDAC inhibitors on neurotransmission in the mouse neuromuscular junction. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that olesoxime suppressed selectively evoked neurotransmitter release in response to a single stimulus and 20 Hz activity. Also olesoxime decreased the rate of FM1–43 dye loss (an indicator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis) at low frequency stimulation and 20 Hz. Furthermore, an increase in extracellular Cl− enhanced the action of olesoxime on the exocytosis and olesoxime increased intracellular Cl− levels. The effects of olesoxime on the evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis and [Cl−]i were blocked by membrane-permeable and impermeable VDAC inhibitors. Immunofluorescent labeling pointed on the presence of VDACs on the synaptic membranes. Rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction perturbed the exocytotic release of FM1–43 and cell-permeable VDAC inhibitor (but not olesoxime or impermeable VDAC inhibitor) partially mitigated the rotenone-driven alterations in the FM1–43 unloading and mitochondrial superoxide production. Thus, olesoxime restrains neurotransmission by acting on plasmalemmal VDACs whose activation can limit synaptic vesicle exocytosis probably via increasing anion flux into the nerve terminals.

Abstract: Adiponectin (APN), an adipose tissue-derived hormone, plays a key role in regulating energy metabolism in mammals. However, its physiological roles in teleosts remain poorly understood. In the present study, the apn gene was cloned from large yellow croaker, which was mainly expressed in the adipose, muscle and liver. Further studies showed that adaptor protein phosphotyrosine interaction PH domain and leucine zipper 1 (APPL1) was localized in the cytoplasm near the cell membrane and was directly bounded to adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs). Meanwhile, APN played a crucial role in lipid metabolism of primary muscle cells by promoting the synthesis, oxidation and transport of fatty acids, and the promoting effects were blocked by knockdown of appl1 and AdipoRs. Furthermore, the activation/inhibition of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor γ (PPARγ) enhanced/suppressed the APN-mediated lipid metabolism. Overall, results showed that APN mediated lipid metabolism through AdipoRs-APPL1 activated PPARγ and further regulated the synthesis, oxidation and transport of FA. This study will facilitate the investigation of APN functions in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis and reveal the evolution of lipids utilization and energy homeostasis in vertebrates.

Abstract: Spermatogonia migrate to the microenvironment during the establishment from gonocytes and leave it when they differentiate. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of spermatogonial differentiation-associated migration remain mostly unknown. In this study, we show that spermatogonial differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA) was accompanied with increased migration ability and elevated expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a member of the CCN family. CTGF was mainly expressed in the testicular somatic cells and committed spermatogonial progenitors. Recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) promoted the spermatogonial migration and silencing of endogenous CTGF suppressed the migration of homogenous spermatogonial cell lines. Moreover, depletion of CTGF by neutralizing antibody inhibited the elevated migration ability induced by RA, suggesting both the paracrine and autocrine roles of CTGF in spermatogonial migration associated with differentiation. Finally, CTGF interacted with β1-integrin and regulated its level in spermatogonial cell lines. Together, our study provides novel insights into the regulation of spermatogonial migration by CTGF, which may shed light on the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic disease of the arterial wall where both innate and adaptive immunoinflammatory mechanisms are involved. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathological process of atherosclerosis at various stages. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also known as WWTR1) behave as a novel drug target against atherosclerosis. Therefore, the mechanism relationship of YAP/TAZ, inflammation and AS was explored in this study. Experiments demonstrated that serine dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of YAP was increased in ECs and pericytes induced by oxidative low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), while the inhibition of YAP degraded the expression of downstream inflammatory factors. The expression of YAP/TAZ and inflammation proteins (JNK, NF-κB and TNF-α) in ECs and pericytes was suppressed through the application of Sal-B. Besides, Sal-B protects ECs and pericytes from oxidative stress and apoptosis. In vivo, Sal-B reduced en face and aortic root sinus lesions size, and decreased the expression of inflammation related factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and ox-LDL in serum sample of ApoE−/− mice fed a high fat diet. Therefore, our work provides a potential therapeutic strategy of using Sal-B to attenuate the development of atherosclerosis, the anti-atherosclerosis effects of Sal-B is related to regulate YAP/TAZ/JNK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Chronic exposure to elevated levels of glucose and free fatty acids impairs beta-cell function, leading to insulin secretion defects and eventually beta-cell failure. Using a semi-high throughput approach applied to INS-1E beta-cells, we tested multiple conditions of chronic exposure to basal, intermediate and high glucose, combined with saturated versus mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids in order to assess cell integrity, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, glucose-stimulated calcium rise and secretory kinetics. INS-1E beta-cells were cultured for 3 days at different glucose concentrations (5.5, 11.1, 25 mM) without or with BSA-complexed 0.4 mM saturated (C16:0 palmitate), monounsaturated (C18:1 oleate) or polyunsaturated (C18:2 linoleate, C18:3 linolenate) fatty acids, resulting in 0.1–0.5 μM unbound fatty acids. Accumulation of triglycerides in cells exposed to fatty acids was glucose-dependent, oleate inducing the strongest lipid storage and protecting against glucose-induced cytotoxicity. The combined chronic exposure to both high glucose and either palmitate or oleate altered mitochondrial function as well as glucose-induced calcium rise. This pattern did not directly translate at the secretory level since palmitate and oleate exhibited distinct effects on the first and the second phases of glucose-stimulated exocytosis. Both fatty acids changed the activity of kinases, such as the MODY-associated BLK. Additionally, chronic exposure to fatty acids modified membrane physicochemical properties by increasing membrane fluidity, oleate exhibiting larger effects compared to palmitate. Chronic fatty acids differentially and specifically exacerbated some of the glucotoxic effects, without promoting cytotoxicity on their own. Each of the tested fatty acids functionally modified INS-1E beta-cell, oleate inducing the strongest effects.

Abstract: The components of the cardiac conduction system, responsible for coordinated activation of the heart chambers, are well defined and their cells differ in gene expression profile and phenotype from those of the surrounding working myocardium. Yet, when and on what basis the myocardium of each of the conduction system components become distinguishable from other myocardium during heart development has not been well established. To identify and assess cell type-specific expression profiles and differentiation markers, we performed transcriptome analysis on fluorescence activated cell sorted purified conduction system (Venus+) and chamber myocardial cells (Katushka+) of Tbx3+/Venus;TgNppb(Katushka) double transgenic mouse fetuses. We found that transcripts associated with nervous system development and ion channel activity were enriched in Tbx3+ conduction system cells, whereas transcripts associated with mitochondrial function, muscle contraction and fatty acid metabolism were enriched in the Nppb+ working myocardium. We analyzed spatio-temporal expression patterns of several candidate markers (Cacna2d2, Cacna1g, Ephb3, Tnni1), reviewed those of established conduction system markers (Tbx3, Hcn4, Gja5, Cntn2), and placed the patterns in the context of conduction system development. The overview indicates that different properties of conduction system components develop gradually and at different developmental stages, and that chamber myocardium gradually differentiates and diverges from conduction system myocardium until after birth.

Abstract: The zinc/iron permease (ZIP/SLC39A) family plays an important role in metal ion transport and is essential for diverse physiological processes. Members of the ZIP family function primarily in the influx of transition metal ions zinc and iron, into cytoplasm from extracellular space or intracellular organelles. The molecular determinants defining metal ion selectivity among ZIP family members remain unclear. Specifically, we reported before that the Drosophila ZIP family member ZIP13 (dZIP13), functions as an iron exporter and was responsible for pumping iron into the secretory pathway. ZIP13 protein is unique in that it differs from the other LIV-1 subfamily members at transmembrane domain IV (TM4), wherein relative positions of the conserved H and D residues in the HNXXD sequence motif are switched, generating a DNXXH motif. In this study, we undertook an in vivo approach to explore the significance of this D/H exchange. Comparative functional analysis of mutants revealed that the relative positions of D and H are critical for the physiological roles of dZIP13 and its close homologue dZIP7. Swapping D/H position of this DNXXH sequence in dZIP13 resulted in loss of iron activity; normal dZIP13 could not complement dZIP7 loss, but swapping the two relative amino acid positions D and H in dZIP13 was sufficient to make it functionally analogous to its close homologue dZIP7. This work provides the first in vivo functional analysis of a structural motif required to differentiate different transporting functions of ZIPs.

Abstract: The heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y binds to CCAAT boxes of genes of glutamine metabolism. We set out to study the role of the regulatory NF-YA subunit in this pathway. We produced U2OS and A549 clones stably overexpressing -OE- the two splicing isoforms of NF-YA. NF-YA OE cells show normal growth and colony formation rates, but they become resistant to cell death upon glutamine deprivation. Increased mRNA and protein expression of the key biosynthetic enzyme GLUL in U2OS entails increased production of endogenous glutamine upon deprivation. The use of GLUL inhibitors dampens the NF-YA-mediated effect. NF-YA OE prevents activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP/DDIT3. Elevated basal levels of SERCA1/2, coding for the molecular target of Thapsigargin, correlate with resistance of NF-YA OE cells to the drug. The work represents a proof-of-principle that elevated levels of NF-YA, as found in some tumor types, helps altering cancer metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Recently, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have become widely used in anti-cancer treatment; however, due to acquired drug resistance and their relatively low specificity, they are largely ineffective against late-stage cancer. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these issues, so as to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent late-stage cancer progression and resistance acquisition. The present study investigated the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), that has been shown to mediate histone acetylation by regulating histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity during HDACi treatment in human gastric-cancer cell lines (i.e. AGS and NCI-N87 cells). The potent HDACi, Aza-PBHA, was thus shown to upregulate AHR expression in both AGS and NCI-N87 cell lines, and to increase histone acetylation levels by facilitating AHR/HDAC interactions. Conversely, AHR knockdown increased HDAC activity. Aza-PBHA also increased PKCα phosphorylation and membrane translocation; however, interestingly, PKCα inhibition reduced the Aza-PBHA-increased AHR and histone acetylation levels, and inhibited the formation of the AHR/HDAC complex, likely upregulating Aza-PBHA-inhibited cell migration. Thus, our results suggest that Aza-PBHA treatment increased AHR levels to suppress HDAC activity, and inhibited cell migration by activating PKCα activation. These findings support the use of drugs to control AHR-related epigenetic regulation as a promising potential method to prevent acquired resistance to cancer treatments.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which digested fat is absorbed and transported in the circulation are well documented. However, it is uncertain whether the molecular species composition of dietary fats influences the molecular species composition of meal-derived lipids in blood. This may be important because enzymes that remove meal-derived fatty acids from the circulation exhibit differential activities towards individual lipid molecular species. To determine the effect of consuming oils with different molecular compositions on the incorporation of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 into plasma lipid molecular species. Men and women (18–30 years) consumed standardised meals containing 20:5n-5 and 22:6n-3 (total 450 mg) provided by an oil from transgenic Camelina sativa (CSO) or a blended fish oil (BFO) which differed in the composition of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 – containing molecular species. Blood was collected during the subsequent 8 h. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The molecular species composition of the test oils was distinct from the composition of plasma triacylglycerol (TG) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species at baseline and at 1.5 or 6 h after the meal. The rank order by concentration of both plasma PC and TG molecular species at baseline was maintained during the postprandial period. 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were incorporated preferentially into plasma PC compared to plasma TG. Together these findings suggest that the composition of dietary lipids undergoes extensive rearrangement after absorption, such that plasma TG and PC maintain their molecular species composition, which may facilitate lipase activities in blood and/or influence lipoprotein structural stability and function.

Abstract: The bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation in cardiovascular diseases. Produced in large part by the secreted lysophospholipase D autotaxin (ATX), LPA acts on a series of G protein-coupled receptors and may have action on atypical receptors such as RAGE to exert potent effects on vascular cells, including the promotion of foam cell formation and phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. The signaling effects of LPA can be terminated by integral membrane lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) that hydrolyze the lipid to receptor inactive products. Human genetic variants in PLPP3, that predict lower levels of LPP3, associate with risk for premature coronary artery disease, and reductions of LPP3 expression in mice promote the development of experimental atherosclerosis and enhance inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesions. Recent evidence also supports a role for ATX, and potentially LPP3, in calcific aortic stenosis. In summary, LPA may be a relevant inflammatory mediator in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heightened LPA signaling may explain the cardiovascular disease risk effect of PLPP3 variants.

Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is an essential regulator of intracellular cholesterol efflux. Secreted cholesterol binds to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in peripheral blood to constitute high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) complexes. ABCA1 protein on the surface of macrophages acts as a crucial controller in preventing cholesterol accumulation. Importantly, ABCA1 is unstable and easily degraded via a series of biochemical activities, including but not limited to calpain-mediated and ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated processes. How accelerated ABCA1 degradation impacts disordered lipid metabolism in macrophages and foam cell formation is unclear. N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors with high calcium permeability. Calcium influx via NMDARs activates downstream signaling pathways. Over-activation of NMDARs stimulated by NMDA contributes to dysfunctional lipid metabolism in macrophages and foam cell formation via promotion of calpain-mediated ABCA1 proteolysis. However, increased NMDAR activity does not affect liver X receptor expression or ABCA1 mRNA levels. Following NMDA receptor silencing or calpain inhibition, NMDA treatment did not reduce ABCA1 protein levels, nor caused lipid accumulation in macrophages. In addition, NMDAR over-activation activates NF-κB signaling to promote IL-1β and IL-6 macrophage marker expression. However, NMDAR silencing and calpain inhibition reduce inflammatory macrophage responses. In summary, our study suggests that NMDAR activation reduces surface ABCA1 protein, promotes lipid accumulation, and induces the production and secretion of many inflammatory mediators in macrophages, possibly through enhanced calpain-mediated ABCA1 protein degradation. Thus, the NMDAR receptor may be a novel pharmacologic target for atherosclerosis therapy.

Abstract: N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) as a tumor suppressor is frequently downregulated in human T-lymphotropic retrovirus (HTLV-1)-infected adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and variety of cancers, and negatively regulates PI3K signaling pathways through dephosphorylation of PTEN with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We recently identified that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is one of novel NDRG2 binding proteins and the knockdown of PRMT5 induces cell apoptosis with degradation of several signaling molecules. To investigate how the apoptosis is induced by the knockdown PRMT5 expression, heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90A) was identified as a binding protein for NDRG2 or PRMT5 by immunoprecipitation-mass analysis. NDRG2/PP2A complex inhibited arginine methyltransferase activity of PRMT5 through dephosphorylation at Serine 335 (S335); however, in NDRG2low ATL-related cells, highly phosphorylated PRMT5 at S335 was mainly localized in cytoplasm with binding to HSP90A, resulting in enhancing arginine-methylation at the middle domain (R345 and R386). Since knockdown of PRMT5 expression or forced expression of HSP90A with alanine replacement of R345 or R386 induced apoptosis with the degradation of client proteins in NDRG2low ATL-related and other cancer cells, we here identified that the novel arginine methylations of HSP90A are essential for maintenance of its function in NDRG2low ATL and other cancer cells.

Abstract: Macrophages (MO) are versatile cells, assuming distinct functional phenotypes depending on the activating stimulus and the microenvironment. The differential activation of macrophages is supported by profound intracellular metabolic changes, being well accepted that the M1/M(LPS+IFN-γ) phenotype rely on aerobic glycolysis, while M2/M(IL-4) macrophages depend on oxidative metabolism. On the other hand, although tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are characterized by their high expression of M2/M(IL-4) markers, is currently unclear whether TAMs present the same oxidative metabolic profile of M2/M(IL-4) cells. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that despite their high expression of M2/M(IL-4) markers, TAMs show high glycolytic activity, with high lactate secretion similar to the M1/M(LPS+ IFN-γ) phenotype. This activity seems to be essential for the M2 profile of TAMs, since the inhibition of glycolysis, but not the impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation or pentose phosphate pathway, diminished the expression of M2/M(IL-4) markers. These novel data indicate that TAMs, although are usually phenotyped as M2/M(IL-4)-like macrophages, they are metabolically distinct from these cells, being rather similar to M1/M(LPS+IFN-γ) macrophages, depending on the glycolytic metabolism to support their profile and functions.

Abstract: One neurotoxic mechanism of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), the major component of senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, is to trigger cell cycle reentry in fully differentiated neurons. However, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using Aβ25-35–treated primary rat cortical neurons as the experimental system, in the present study we tested whether Aβ-induced inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) contribute to cell cycle reentry in fully differentiated post-mitotic neurons. We found that Id1-induced HIF-1α mediated Aβ25-35–dependent expression of the cell cycle markers cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), both colocalized with microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) + cells, indicative of cell cycle reentry in the mature neurons. Aβ25-35 also enhanced p35 cleavage to p25 without affecting CDK5 expression. The CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine and the siRNA targeting CDK5 both suppressed Aβ25-35–dependent HIF-1α expression and cell cycle reentry. Intriguingly, Aβ25-35–induced Id1 repressed p25 production while CDK5/p25 reciprocally inhibited Id1 expression, despite the observation that both Id1 and CDK5/p25 acted upstream of HIF-1α. These results demonstrated that both Id1/HIF-1 and CDK5/HIF-1 contribute to Aβ-induced cell cycle reentry in post-mitotic neurons; furthermore, Id1 and CDK5/p25 reciprocally suppress expression of each other.

Abstract: Native myocardium has limited regenerative potential post injury. Advances in lineage reprogramming have provided promising cellular sources for regenerative medicine in addition to research applications. Recently we have shown that adult mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to expandable, multipotent, induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) by employing forced expression of five cardiac factors along with activation of canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling. Here we aim to further characterize iCPCs by highlighting their safety, ease of attainability, and functionality within a three-dimensional cardiac extracellular matrix scaffold. Specifically, iCPCs did not form teratomas in contrast to embryonic stem cells when injected into immunodeficient mice. iCPC reprogramming was achieved in wild type mouse fibroblasts without requiring a cardiac-specific reporter, solely utilizing morphological changes to identify, clonally isolate, and expand iCPCs, thus increasing the versatility of this technology. iCPCs also show the ability to repopulate decellularized native heart scaffolds and differentiated into organized structures containing cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Optical mapping of recellularized scaffolds shows field-stimulated calcium transients that propagate across islands of reconstituted tissue and bipolar local stimulation demonstrates cell-cell coupling within scaffolds. Overall, iCPCs provide a readily attainable, scalable, safe, and functional cell source for a variety of application including drug discovery, disease modeling, and regenerative therapy.

Abstract: During keratinocyte stratification and wound healing, keratinocytes undergo a switch between differentiation and motility. However, limited knowledge exists on the mechanisms of the switch. We have previously demonstrated that the expression of CD9 was changed in different wound stages and involved in the regulation of keratinocyte migration. In this study, we showed that CD9 expression was increased in both human and mouse keratinocytes undergoing differentiation. CD9 overexpression in keratinocytes stimulated terminal differentiation and reduced cell motility. CD9 silencing inhibited calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation and increased cell motility. Furthermore, CD9 overexpression recruited E-cadherin to the plasma membrane and subsequently activated PI3K/Akt signaling, while CD9 knockdown inhibited the recruitment of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane and PI3K/Akt activation. Importantly, silencing E-cadherin expression or inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling reversed CD9 overexpression-induced differentiation and -reduced motility. These results demonstrate that CD9 acts as an important node that regulates keratinocyte differentiation and motility. The recruitment of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway mediated by CD9 play an important role in these processes.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle secretes biologically active proteins that contribute to muscle hypertrophy in response to either exercise or dietary intake. The identification of skeletal muscle-secreted proteins that induces hypertrophy can provide critical information regarding skeletal muscle health. Dietary provitamin A, β-carotene, induces hypertrophy of the soleus muscle in mice. Here, we hypothesized that skeletal muscle produces hypertrophy-inducible secretory proteins via dietary β-carotene. Knockdown of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) γ inhibited the β-carotene-induced increase soleus muscle mass in mice. Using RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analyses, and literature searching, we predicted transglutaminase 2 (TG2) to be an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced secretory protein in cultured C2C12 myotubes. Tg2 mRNA expression increased in ATRA- or β-carotene-stimulated myotubes and in the soleus muscle of β-carotene-treated mice. Knockdown of RARγ inhibited β-carotene-increased mRNA expression of Tg2 in the soleus muscle. ATRA increased endogenous TG2 levels in conditioned medium from myotubes. Extracellular TG2 promoted the phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), and inhibitors of mTOR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Src (rapamycin, LY294002, and Src I1, respectively) inhibited TG2-increased phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K. Furthermore, extracellular TG2 promoted protein synthesis and hypertrophy in myotubes. TG2 mutant lacking transglutaminase activity exerted the same effects as wild-type TG2. Knockdown of G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) inhibited the effects of TG2 on mTOR signaling, protein synthesis, and hypertrophy. These results indicated that TG2 expression was upregulated through ATRA-mediated RARγ and that extracellular TG2 induced myotube hypertrophy by activating mTOR signaling-mediated protein synthesis through GPR56, independent of transglutaminase activity.

Abstract: The farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) is validated target in the cholestatic disorders treatment. Obeticholic acid (OCA), the first in class of FXR agonist approved for clinical use, causes side effects including acute liver decompensation when administered to cirrhotic patients with primary biliary cholangitis at higher than recommended doses. The V-Maf avian-musculoaponeurotic-fibrosarcoma-oncogene-homolog-G (Mafg) and nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related-factor-2 (Nrf2) mediates some of the downstream effects of FXR. In the present study we have investigated the role of FXR/MafG/NRF2 pathway in the development of liver toxicity caused by OCA in rodent models of cholestasis. Cholestasis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) or administration of α-naphtyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT) to male Wistar rats and FXR−/− and FXR+/+ mice. Treating BDL and ANIT rats with OCA exacerbated the severity of cholestasis, hepatocytes injury and severely downregulated the expression of basolateral transporters. In mice, genetic ablation FXR or its pharmacological inhibition by 3-(naphthalen-2-yl)-5-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole rescued from negative regulation of MRP4 and protected against liver injury caused by ANIT. By RNAseq analysis we found that FXR antagonism effectively reversed the transcription of over 2100 genes modulated by OCA/ANIT treatment, including Mafg and Nrf2 and their target genes Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Mat1a, Mat2a, Gss. Genetic and pharmacological Mafg inhibition by liver delivery of siRNA antisense or S-adenosylmethionine effectively rescued from damage caused by ANIT/OCA. In contrast, Nrf2 induction by sulforaphane was protective.
Conclusions
Liver injury caused by FXR agonism in cholestasis is FXR-dependent and is reversed by FXR and Mafg antagonism or Nrf2 induction.

Abstract: A family of glycerol-based lysolipid mediators comprises lysophosphatidic acid as a representative phospholipidic member but also a monoacylglycerol as a non-phosphorus-containing member. These critical lysolipid mediators are known to be produced from different lysophospholipids by actions of lysophospholipases C and D in mammals. Some members of the glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) family have attracted recent attention due to their phospholipid-metabolizing activity. In this study, we found selective depletion of lysophosphatidylinositol among lysophospholipids in the culture medium of COS-7 cells transfected with a vector containing glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDPD2, GDE3). Thin-layer chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of lipids extracted from GDE3-transfected COS-7 cells exposed to fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylinositol (PI) revealed that GDE3 acted as an ecto-type lysophospholipase C preferring endogenous lysophosphatidylinositol and PI having a long-chain acyl and a short-chain acyl group rather than endogenous PI and its fluorescent analog having two long chain acyl groups. In MC3T3-E1 cells cultured with an osteogenic or mitogenic medium, mRNA expression of GDE3 was increased by culturing in 10% fetal bovine serum for several days, concomitant with increased activity of ecto-lysophospholipase C, converting arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylinositol, a physiological agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 55, to arachidonoylglycerol, a physiological agonist of cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2. We suggest that GDE3 acts as an ecto-lysophospholipase C, by switching signaling from lysophosphatidylinositol to that from arachidonoylglycerol in an opposite direction in mouse bone remodeling.

Abstract: The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) transcription factors family, which regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and homeostasis, have recently been implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes such as immune regulation and inflammation in vertebrates. Consistent with other invertebrates, we identified a single SREBP ortholog in Penaeus vannamei (designated PvSREBP) with transcripts ubiquitously expressed in tissues and induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Streptococcus iniae. In vivo RNA interference (RNAi) of PvSREBP attenuated the expression of several fatty acid metabolism-related genes (i.e., cyclooxygenase (PvCOX), lipoxygenase (PvLOX), fatty acid binding protein (PvFABP) and fatty acid synthase (PvFASN)), which consequently decreased the levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (ΣPUFAs). In addition, PvSREBP silencing decreased transcript levels of several immune-related genes such as hemocyanin (PvHMC) and trypsin (PvTrypsin), as well as genes encoding for heat-shock proteins (i.e., PvHSP60, PvHSP70 and PvHSP90). Moreover, in silico analysis revealed the presence of SREBP binding motifs on the promoters of most of the dysregulated genes, while shrimp depleted of PvSREBP were more susceptible to V. parahaemolyticus infection. Collectively, we demonstrated the involvement of shrimp SREBP in fatty acids metabolism and immune response, and propose that PvSREBP and PvHMC modulate each other through a feedback mechanism to establish homeostasis. The current study is the first to show the dual role of SREBP in fatty acid metabolism and immune response in invertebrates and crustaceans.

Abstract: Sequestration of misfolded proteins into distinct cellular compartments plays a pivotal role in proteostasis and proteopathies. Cytoplasmic ubiquitinated proteins are sequestered by p62/SQSTM1 to deposit in sequestosomes or aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS). Most aggresome or ALIS regulators identified thus far are recruiters, while little is known about the disaggregases or dissolvers. In this research, we showed that lanosterol synthase and its enzymatic product lanosterol effectively reduced the number and/or size of sequestosomes/ALIS/aggresomes formed by endogenous proteins in the HeLa and HEK-293A cells cultured under both non-stressed and stressed conditions. Supplemented lanosterol did not affect the proteasome and autophagic activities, but released the trapped proteins from the p62-positive inclusions accompanied with the activation of HSF1 and up-regulation of various heat shock proteins. Our results suggested that the coordinated actions of disaggregation by lanosterol and refolding by heat shock proteins might facilitate the cells to recycle proteins from aggregates. The disaggregation activity of lanosterol was not shared by cholesterol, indicating that lanosterol possesses additional cellular functions in proteostasis regulation. Our findings highlight that besides protein modulators, the cells also possess endogenous low-molecular-weight compounds as efficient proteostasis regulators.

Abstract: Cilia are ubiquitous in mammalian cells. The formation and assembly of cilia depend on the normal functioning of the ciliary transport system. In recent years, various proteins involved in the intracellular transport of the cilium have attracted attention, as many diseases are caused by disorders in cilia formation. Intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) is a subunit of IFT complex B, which contains approximately 20 protein particles. Studies have shown that defects in IFT20 are associated with numerous system -related diseases, such as those of the urinary system, cardiovascular system, skeletal system, nervous system, immune system, reproductive system, and respiratory system. This review summarizes current research on IFT20.We describe studies related to the role of IFT20 in cilia formation and discuss new targets for treating diseases associated with ciliary dysplasia.

Abstract: The large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel is a major ionic determinant of vascular tone, vasodilation, and blood pressure. The activity of BK channels is regulated in part by membrane presentation. Rab GTPase (Rab) regulates important cellular processes, including ion channel membrane trafficking. We hypothesize that Rab4a participates in the regulation of BK channel α-subunit (BK-α) membrane trafficking. We found that vascular BK-α interacts physically with Rab4a. Co-expression of dominant-negative Rab4a reduced BK-α surface expression, whereas that of constitutively-active Rab4a augmented BK-α surface presentation. These novel findings suggest that vascular BK channel membrane expression is regulated by Rab4a through channel membrane trafficking.

Abstract: The nuclear accumulation of proteins may depend on the presence of short targeting sequences, which are known as nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Here, we found that NLSs are predicted in some cytosolic proteins and examined the hypothesis that these NLSs may be functional under certain conditions. As a model, human cardiac troponin I (hcTnI) was used. After expression in cultured non-muscle or undifferentiated muscle cells, hcTnI accumulated inside nuclei. Several NLSs were predicted and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis in hcTnI. Nuclear import occurred via the classical karyopherin-α/β nuclear import pathway. However, hcTnI expressed in cultured myoblasts redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it was integrated into forming myofibrils after the induction of muscle differentiation. It appears that the dynamic retention of proteins inside cytoplasmic structures can lead to switching between nuclear and cytoplasmic localization.

Abstract: The regulation of stem cell differentiation is key for muscle tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To this end, various substrates mimicking the native extracellular matrix (ECM) have been developed with consideration of the mechanical, topological, and biochemical properties. However, mimicking the biochemical properties of the native ECM is difficult due to its compositional complexity. To develop substrates that mimic the native ECM and its biochemical properties, decellularization is typically used. Here, substrates mimicking the native ECM at each myogenic stage are prepared as stepwise myogenesis-mimicking matrices via the in vitro myogenic culture of C2C12 myoblasts and decellularization. Cells adhered to the stepwise myogenesis-mimicking matrices at similar levels. However, the matrices derived from cells at the myogenic early stage suppressed cell growth and promoted myogenesis. This promotion of myogenesis was potentially due to the suppression of the activation of endogenous BMP signaling following the suppression of the expression of the myogenic-inhibitory factors, Id2 and Id3. Our stepwise myogenesis-mimicking matrices will be suitable ECM models for basic biological research and myogenesis of stem cells. Further, these matrices will provide insights that improve the efficacy of decellularized ECM for muscle repair.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is not only a catabolic intermediate of all sphingolipids but also an evolutionary conserved bioactive lipid with critical functions in cell survival, differentiation, and migration as well as in immunity and angiogenesis. S1P-lyase (SGPL1) irreversibly cleaves S1P in the final step of sphingolipid catabolism. As sphingoid bases and their 1-phosphates are not only metabolic intermediates but also highly bioactive lipids that modulate a wide range of physiological processes, it would be predicted that their elevation might induce adjustments in other facets of sphingolipid metabolism and/or alter cell behavior. We actually found in a previous study that in terminally differentiated neurons SGPL1 deficiency increases sphingolipid formation via recycling at the expense of de novo synthesis. We now investigated whether and how SGPL1 deficiency affects the metabolism of (glyco)sphingolipids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). According to our previous experiments in neurons, we found a strong accumulation of S1P in SGPL1-deficient MEFs. Surprisingly, a completely different situation arose as we analyzed sphingolipid metabolism in this non-differentiated cell type. The production of biosynthetic precursors of complex glycosphingolipids including ceramide, glucosylceramide and also ganglioside GM3 via de novo synthesis and recycling pathway was substantially increased whereas the amount of more complex gangliosides dropped significantly.

Abstract: Microtubules are polymers of α/β-tubulin, with microtubule organization being regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Herein, we describe a novel role for the epithelial gene repressor, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), that “switches” from a chromatin-associated protein during interphase, to a MAP that associates with α-, β- and γ-tubulin during mitosis. Additionally, ZEB1 was also demonstrated to associate with γ-tubulin at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Using confocal microscopy, ZEB1 localization was predominantly nuclear during interphase, with α/β-tubulin being primarily cytoplasmic and the association between these proteins being minimal. However, during the stages of mitosis, ZEB1 co-localization with α-, β-, and γ-tubulin was significantly increased, with the association commonly peaking during metaphase in multiple tumor cell-types. ZEB1 was also observed to accumulate in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. The increased interaction between ZEB1 and α-tubulin during mitosis was also confirmed using the proximity ligation assay. In contrast to ZEB1, its paralog ZEB2, was mainly perinuclear and cytoplasmic during interphase, showing some co-localization with α-tubulin during mitosis. Considering the association between ZEB1 with α/β/γ-tubulin during mitosis, studies investigated ZEB1's role in the cell cycle. Silencing ZEB1 resulted in a G2-M arrest, which could be mediated by the up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 that are known downstream targets repressed by ZEB1. However, it cannot be excluded the G2/M arrest observed after ZEB1 silencing is not due to its roles as a MAP. Collectively, ZEB1 plays a role as a MAP during mitosis and could be functionally involved in this process.

Abstract: Omega-3 polyunsatuarted fatty acids (PUFA) are associated with hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, omega-3 PUFA, usually administered as triacylglycerols or ethyl esters, could also compromise glucose metabolism, especially in obese type 2 diabetics. Phospholipids represent an alternative source of omega-3 PUFA, but their impact on glucose homeostasis is poorly explored. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed for 8 weeks a corn oil-based high-fat diet (cHF) alone or cHF-based diets containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (~3%; wt/wt), admixed either as a concentrate of re-esterified triacylglycerols (ω3TG) or Krill oil containing mainly phospholipids (ω3PL). Lean controls were fed a low-fat diet. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), parameters of glucose homeostasis, adipose tissue function, and plasma levels of N-acylethanolamines, monoacylglycerols and fatty acids were determined. Feeding cHF induced obesity and worsened (~4.3-fold) insulin sensitivity as determined by clamp. Insulin sensitivity was almost preserved in ω3PL but not ω3TG mice. Compared with cHF mice, endogenous glucose production was reduced to 47%, whereas whole-body and muscle glycogen synthesis increased ~3-fold in ω3PL mice that showed improved adipose tissue function and elevated plasma adiponectin levels. Besides eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids, principal component analysis of plasma fatty acids identified palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7) as the most discriminating analyte whose levels were increased in ω3PL mice and correlated negatively with the degree of cHF-induced glucose intolerance. While palmitoleic acid from Krill oil may help improve glucose homeostasis, our findings provide a general rationale for using omega-3 PUFA-containing phospholipids as nutritional supplements with potent insulin-sensitizing effects.

Abstract: p21-activated protein kinase (PAK2) is a unique member of the PAK family kinases that plays important roles in stress signaling. It can be activated by binding to the small GTPase, Cdc42 and Rac1, or by caspase 3 cleavage. Cdc42-activated PAK2 mediates cytostasis, whereas caspase 3-cleaved PAK2 contributes to apoptosis. However, the relationship between these two states of PAK2 activation remains elusive. In this study, through protein biochemical analyses and various cell-based assays, we demonstrated that full-length PAK2 activated by Cdc42 was resistant to the cleavage by caspase 3 in vitro and within cells. When mammalian cells were treated by oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, PAK2 was highly activated through caspase 3 cleavage that led to apoptosis. However, when PAK2 was pre-activated by Cdc42 or by mild stress such as serum deprivation, it was no longer able to be cleaved by caspase 3 upon hydrogen peroxide treatment, and the subsequent apoptosis was also largely inhibited. Furthermore, cells expressing active mutants of full-length PAK2 became more resistant to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis than inactive mutants. Taken together, this study identified two states of PAK2 activation, wherein Cdc42- and autophosphorylation-dependent activation inhibited the constitutive activation of PAK2 by caspase cleavage. The regulation between these two states of PAK2 activation provides a new molecular mechanism to support PAK2 as a molecular switch for controlling cytostasis and apoptosis in response to different types and levels of stress with broad physiological and pathological relevance.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that circulating dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) can be desulfated and further metabolized to estrogen, which is of concern for all patients with estrogen-responsive breast cancer. We addressed this issue by comparing the effects of DHEAS, its desulfated form DHEA, and 17ß-estradiol on human metastatic, estrogen-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Physiological concentrations of DHEAS promoted phosphorylation of Erk1/2, whereas DHEA and 17ß-estradiol failed to stimulate Erk1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the sulfated steroid acts as an autonomous hormone. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to 17ß-estradiol stimulated cell proliferation and the expression of pro-metastatic and pro-invasive elements such as claudin-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and the CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). In contrast, treatment with DHEAS did not stimulate these responses but prevented all of the actions of 17ß-estradiol, and as a consequence cell migration and invasion were completely inhibited. The results of this study not only challenge the assumption that DHEAS poses a danger as an endogenous source of estrogen, they rather favor the idea that keeping DHEAS levels within a physiological range might be supportive in treating estrogen-responsive breast cancer.
