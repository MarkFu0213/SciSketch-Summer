Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic modifiers frequently harbor loss-of-function mutations in lung cancer, but their tumor-suppressive roles are poorly characterized. Histone methyltransferase KMT2D (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also called MLL4) is among the most highly inactivated epigenetic modifiers in lung cancer. Here, we show that lung-specific loss of Kmt2d promotes lung tumorigenesis in mice and upregulates pro-tumorigenic programs, including glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis preferentially impedes tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells bearing KMT2D-inactivating mutations. Mechanistically, Kmt2d loss widely impairs epigenomic signals for super-enhancers/enhancers, including the super-enhancer for the circadian rhythm repressor Per2. Loss of Kmt2d decreases expression of PER2, which regulates multiple glycolytic genes. These findings indicate that KMT2D is a lung tumor suppressor and that KMT2D deficiency confers a therapeutic vulnerability to glycolytic inhibitors.

Abstract: Astrocytes are the principal homeostatic cells of the central nerves system (CNS) that support the CNS function at all levels of organisation, from molecular to organ. Several fundamental homeostatic functions of astrocytes are mediated through plasmalemmal pumps and transporters; most of which are also regulated by the transplasmalemmal gradient of Na+ ions. Neuronal activity as well as mechanical or chemical stimulation of astrocytes trigger plasmalemmal Na+ fluxes, which in turn generate spatio-temporally organised transient changes in the cytosolic Na+ concentration, which represent the substrate of astroglial Na+ signalling. Astroglial Na+ signals link and coordinate neuronal activity and CNS homeostatic demands with the astroglial homeostatic response.

Abstract: Summary
The hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) play indispensable roles in memory formation, and importantly, a hippocampal oscillation known as ripple is key to consolidation of new memories. However, it remains unclear how the hippocampus and RSC communicate and the role of ripple oscillation in coordinating the activity between these two brain regions. Here, we record from the dorsal hippocampus and RSC simultaneously in freely behaving mice during sleep and reveal that the RSC displays a pre-ripple activation associated with slow and fast oscillations. Immediately after ripples, a subpopulation of RSC putative inhibitory neurons increases firing activity, while most RSC putative excitatory neurons decrease activity. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of this hippocampus-RSC pathway activates and suppresses RSC putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively. These results suggest that the dorsal hippocampus mainly inhibits RSC activity via its direct innervation of RSC inhibitory neurons, which overshadows the RSC in supporting learning and memory functions.

Abstract: Summary
The remarkable cellular and genetic heterogeneity of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) limits the clinical benefit of targeted therapies. Here, we show that expression of the gluconeogenic isozyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) is silenced in a broad spectrum of sarcoma subtypes, revealing an apparent common metabolic feature shared by diverse STSs. Enforced FBP2 expression inhibits sarcoma cell and tumor growth through two distinct mechanisms. First, cytosolic FBP2 antagonizes elevated glycolysis associated with the “Warburg effect,” thereby inhibiting sarcoma cell proliferation. Second, nuclear-localized FBP2 restrains mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in a catalytic-activity-independent manner by inhibiting the expression of nuclear respiratory factor and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Specifically, nuclear FBP2 colocalizes with the c-Myc transcription factor at the TFAM locus and represses c-Myc-dependent TFAM expression. This unique dual function of FBP2 provides a rationale for its selective suppression in STSs, identifying a potential metabolic vulnerability of this malignancy and possible therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Increased calpain activity is linked to neuroinflammation including a heritable retinal disease caused by hyper-activating mutations in the calcium-activated calpain-5 (CAPN5) protease. Although structures for classical calpains are known, the structure of CAPN5, a non-classical calpain, remains undetermined. Here we report the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the human CAPN5 protease core (CAPN5-PC). Compared to classical calpains, CAPN5-PC requires high calcium concentrations for maximal activity. Structure-based phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment reveal that CAPN5-PC contains three elongated flexible loops compared to its classical counterparts. The presence of a disease-causing mutation (c.799G>A, p.Gly267Ser) on the unique PC2L2 loop reveals a function in this region for regulating enzymatic activity. This mechanism could be transferred to distant calpains, using synthetic calpain hybrids, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism for fine-tuning calpain function by modifying flexible loops. Further, the open (inactive) conformation of CAPN5-PC provides structural insight into CAPN5-specific residues that can guide inhibitor design.

Abstract: Summary
In rodents, the decrease of felid aversion induced by Toxoplasma gondii, a phenomenon termed fatal attraction, is interpreted as an adaptive manipulation by the neurotropic protozoan parasite. With the aim of understanding how the parasite induces such specific behavioral modifications, we performed a multiparametric analysis of T. gondii-induced changes on host behavior, physiology, and brain transcriptome as well as parasite cyst load and distribution. Using a set of complementary behavioral tests, we provide strong evidence that T. gondii lowers general anxiety in infected mice, increases explorative behaviors, and surprisingly alters predator aversion without selectivity toward felids. Furthermore, we show a positive correlation between the severity of the behavioral alterations and the cyst load, which indirectly reflects the level of inflammation during brain colonization. Taken together, these findings refute the myth of a selective loss of cat fear in T. gondii-infected mice and point toward widespread immune-related alterations of behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Projections from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (VP) regulate relapse in animal models of addiction. The VP contains GABAergic (VPGABA) and glutamatergic (VPGlu) neurons, and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons co-express enkephalin (VPPenk). Rabies tracing reveals that VPGlu and VPPenk neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VPGlu neurons inhibits, whereas stimulation of VPGABA and VPPenk neurons potentiates cocaine seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VPGABA neurons increase their overall activity, and VPPenk neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for cocaine. In contrast, VPGlu neurons increase their spike rate following extinction training. These data show that VP subpopulations differentially encode and regulate cocaine seeking, with VPPenk and VPGABA neurons facilitating and VPGlu neurons inhibiting cocaine seeking.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an autosomal dominant polyglutamine expansion mutation of Huntingtin (HTT). HD patients suffer from progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments, along with significant degeneration of the striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the striatum. HD is widely accepted to be caused by a toxic gain-of-function of mutant HTT. However, whether loss of HTT function, because of dominant-negative effects of the mutant protein, plays a role in HD and whether HTT is required for SPN health and function are not known. Here, we delete Htt from specific subpopulations of SPNs using the Cre-Lox system and find that SPNs require HTT for motor regulation, synaptic development, cell health, and survival during aging. Our results suggest that loss of HTT function in SPNs could play a critical role in HD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) provide a reservoir for triacylglycerol storage and are a central hub for fatty acid trafficking and signaling in cells. Lipolysis promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism via a SIRT1/PGC-1α/PPARα-dependent pathway through an unknown mechanism. Herein, we identify that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) allosterically activate SIRT1 toward select peptide-substrates such as PGC-1α. MUFAs enhance PGC-1α/PPARα signaling and promote oxidative metabolism in cells and animal models in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Moreover, we characterize the LD protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5), which is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and function, to be a fatty-acid-binding protein that preferentially binds LD-derived monounsaturated fatty acids and traffics them to the nucleus following cAMP/PKA-mediated lipolytic stimulation. Thus, these studies identify the first-known endogenous allosteric modulators of SIRT1 and characterize a LD-nuclear signaling axis that underlies the known metabolic benefits of MUFAs and PLIN5.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent viral infections subvert key elements of adaptive immunity. To compare germinal center (GC) B cell responses in chronic and acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, we exploit activation-induced deaminase (AID) fate-reporter mice and perform adoptive B cell transfer experiments. Chronic infection yields GC B cell responses of higher cellularity than acute infections do, higher memory B cell and antibody secreting cell output for longer periods of time, a better representation of the late B cell repertoire in serum immunoglobulin, and higher titers of protective neutralizing antibodies. GC B cells of chronically infected mice are similarly hypermutated as those emerging from acute infection. They efficiently adapt to viral escape variants and even in hypermutation-impaired AID mutant mice, chronic infection selects for GC B cells with hypermutated B cell receptors (BCRs) and neutralizing antibody formation. These findings demonstrate that, unlike for CD8+ T cells, chronic viral infection drives a functional, productive, and protective GC B cell response.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) generates heat to maintain body temperature and suppress obesity. Agonists for nuclear receptors PPARα and PPARγ both affect brown adipocyte function, yet the interplay between these factors in BAT is uncertain. Here, we report that PPARα shares most genomic binding sites with PPARγ, and these common binding sites are more related to BAT function than PPARγ-selective sites without PPARα. Integrating PPARα and PPARγ genomic occupancy with cold-responsive BAT transcriptomes identifies a subset of 16 genes with potential relevance to BAT function. Among these, we focused on the lysosomal protease cathepsin Z (CTSZ) and showed it is necessary for mitochondrial respiration in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Thus, CTSZ is a shared PPARα/γ target gene in BAT and a regulator of brown adipocyte thermogenic function.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria possess an array of defenses against foreign invaders, including a broadly distributed bacteriophage defense system termed CBASS (cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system). In CBASS systems, a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase synthesizes cyclic di- or tri-nucleotide second messengers in response to infection, and these molecules activate diverse effectors to mediate bacteriophage immunity via abortive infection. Here, we show that the CBASS effector NucC is related to restriction enzymes but uniquely assembles into a homotrimer. Binding of NucC trimers to a cyclic tri-adenylate second messenger promotes assembly of a NucC homohexamer competent for non-specific double-strand DNA cleavage. In infected cells, NucC activation leads to complete destruction of the bacterial chromosome, causing cell death prior to completion of phage replication. In addition to CBASS systems, we identify NucC homologs in over 30 type III CRISPR/Cas systems, where they likely function as accessory nucleases activated by cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers synthesized by these systems’ effector complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Eradicating tumor dormancy that develops following epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, is an attractive therapeutic strategy but the mechanisms governing this process are poorly understood. Blockade of ERK1/2 reactivation following EGFR TKI treatment by combined EGFR/MEK inhibition uncovers cells that survive by entering a senescence-like dormant state characterized by high YAP/TEAD activity. YAP/TEAD engage the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor SLUG to directly repress pro-apoptotic BMF, limiting drug-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological co-inhibition of YAP and TEAD, or genetic deletion of YAP1, all deplete dormant cells by enhancing EGFR/MEK inhibition-induced apoptosis. Enhancing the initial efficacy of targeted therapies could ultimately lead to prolonged treatment responses in cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
GCNA proteins are expressed across eukarya in pluripotent cells and have conserved functions in fertility. GCNA homologs Spartan (DVC-1) and Wss1 resolve DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), including Topoisomerase-DNA adducts, during DNA replication. Here, we show that GCNA mutants in mouse and C. elegans display defects in genome maintenance including DNA damage, aberrant chromosome condensation, and crossover defects in mouse spermatocytes and spontaneous genomic rearrangements in C. elegans. We show that GCNA and topoisomerase II (TOP2) physically interact in both mice and worms and colocalize on condensed chromosomes during mitosis in C. elegans embryos. Moreover, C. elegans gcna-1 mutants are hypersensitive to TOP2 poison. Together, our findings support a model in which GCNA provides genome maintenance functions in the germline and may do so, in part, by promoting the resolution of TOP2 DPCs.

Abstract: Since the discovery of the three isoforms of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3 in 1990s, many studies have been devoted to identifying their specific roles in different tissues under several physiological or pathophysiological conditions. In particular, several seminal experimental works laid the foundation for better understanding gene and protein structures, tissue distribution, and regulatory functions of each antiporter isoform. On the other hand, despite the efforts in the development of specific compounds selectively targeting NCX1, NCX2 or NCX3 to test their physiological or pathophysiological roles, several drawbacks hampered the achievement of these goals. In fact, at present no isoform-specific compounds have been yet identified. Moreover, these compounds, despite their potency, possess some nonspecific actions against other ion antiporters, ion channels, and channel receptors. As a result, it is difficult to discriminate direct effects of inhibition/activation of NCX isoforms from the inhibitory or stimulatory effects exerted on other antiporters, channels, receptors, or enzymes. To overcome these difficulties, some research groups used transgenic, knock-out and knock-in mice for NCX isoforms as the most straightforward and fruitful strategy to characterize the biological role exerted by each antiporter isoform. The present review will survey the techniques used to study the roles of NCXs and the current knowledge obtained from these genetic modified mice focusing on the advantages obtained with these strategies in understanding the contribution exerted by each isoform.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation of enhancers is dynamic, cell-type specific, and vital for cell fate progression. However, current models inadequately define its role within the hierarchy of gene regulation. Analysis of independent datasets shows an unanticipated overlap between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at enhancers of steady-state stem cells, suggesting that these two opposing features might exist concurrently. To define their temporal relationship, we developed ATAC-Me, which probes accessibility and methylation from single DNA library preparations. We identified waves of accessibility occurring rapidly across thousands of myeloid enhancers in a monocyte-to-macrophage cell fate model. Prolonged methylation states were observed at a majority of these sites, while transcription of nearby genes tracked closely with accessibility. ATAC-Me uncovers a significant disconnect between chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and gene activity. This unexpected observation highlights the value of ATAC-Me in constructing precise molecular timelines for understanding the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation.

Abstract: K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+-exchangers (NCKX) are a relatively recently described five-member gene family of transporters which play a quantitatively significant role in neuronal Ca2+ transport. In this review we highlight the important individual contributions these transporters make to cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal function. Notably, different members of the family make distinct, non-redundant, contributions to critical behavioural pathways. In particular, NCKX proteins regulate the kinetics, termination and adaptation of Ca2+ signals in sensory transduction neurons in the olfactory and visual systems. Similar contributions to shaping the spatial and temporal features of Ca2+ signals in neurons at other key brain locations have important consequences for the circuitry influencing control of satiety, for experience-dependent motor learning and spatial working memory retention, as well as in the protection of neurons in the face of toxic stimuli. NCKX proteins are also key contributors to a variety of events in other tissues. The connection between NCKX isoform function and human phenotype and disease is an emerging area, and we anticipate that future research will reveal rich new details in the coming years.

Understanding metabolic pathways that regulate Th17 development is important to broaden therapeutic options for Th17-mediated autoimmunity. Here, we report a pivotal role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for lineage specification toward pathogenic Th17 differentiation. Th17 cells rapidly increase mitochondrial respiration during development, and this is necessary for metabolic reprogramming following T cell activation. Surprisingly, specific inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase ablates Th17 pathogenicity in a mouse model of autoimmunity by preventing Th17 pathogenic signature gene expression. Notably, cells activated under OXPHOS-inhibited Th17 conditions preferentially express Foxp3, rather than Th17 genes, and become suppressive Treg cells. Mechanistically, OXPHOS promotes the Th17 pioneer transcription factor, BATF, and facilitates T cell receptor (TCR) and mTOR signaling. Correspondingly, overexpression of BATF rescues Th17 development when ATP synthase activity is restricted. Together, our data reveal a regulatory role of mitochondrial OXPHOS in dictating the fate decision between Th17 and Treg cells by supporting early molecular events necessary for Th17 commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Müller glia (MG) serve as sources for retinal regeneration in non-mammalian vertebrates. We find that this process can be induced in mouse MG, after injury, by transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1 and the HDAC inhibitor TSA. However, new neurons are generated only from a subset of MG. Identifying factors that limit Ascl1-mediated MG reprogramming could make this process more efficient. In this study, we test whether injury-induced STAT activation hampers the ability of Ascl1 to reprogram MG into retinal neurons. Single-cell RNA-seq shows that progenitor-like cells derived from Ascl1-expressing MG have a higher level of STAT signaling than do those cells that become neurons. Ascl1-ChIPseq and ATAC-seq show that STAT potentially directs Ascl1 to developmentally inappropriate targets. Using a STAT inhibitor, in combination with our previously described reprogramming paradigm, we found a large increase in the ability of MG to generate neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-based therapies have shown promise for treating myriad chronic pulmonary diseases through direct application of epithelial progenitors or by way of engineered tissue grafts or whole organs. To elucidate environmental effects on epithelial regenerative outcomes in vitro, here, we isolate and culture a population of pharmacologically expanded basal cells (peBCs) from rat tracheas. At peak basal marker expression, we simultaneously split peBCs into four in vitro platforms: organoid, air-liquid interface (ALI), engineered trachea, and engineered lung. Following differentiation, these samples are evaluated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and computational pipelines are developed to compare samples both globally and at the population level. A sample of native rat tracheal epithelium is also evaluated by scRNA-seq as a control for engineered epithelium. Overall, this work identifies platform-specific effects that support the use of engineered models to achieve the most physiologic differential outcomes in pulmonary epithelial regenerative applications.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is well understood to enhance proteome diversity as cells respond to stimuli. However, mechanistic understanding for how the spliceosome processes precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to achieve template diversification is incomplete. We use recently developed enzymatic inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and human naive T lymphocyte activation as a model system to uncover a precise set of mRNA transcripts that require symmetric arginine dimethylation. This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited. Specifically, we identify a conserved role for symmetric arginine dimethylation in the induction of antiviral type I and type III interferon signaling following T cell receptor and pattern recognition receptor stimulation in human T lymphocytes and undifferentiated human THP-1 monocytes. Altogether, these findings reveal a mechanism by which cells may be enabled to precisely modulate transcript heterogeneity to orchestrate specific functional outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The gastrointestinal tract is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells that, together with the mucus layers, protect the underlying tissue from microbial invasion. The epithelium has one of the highest turnover rates in the body. Using stable isotope labeling, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational analysis, we report a comprehensive dataset of the turnover of more than 3,000 and the expression of more than 5,000 intestinal epithelial cell proteins, analyzed under conventional and germ-free conditions across five different segments in mouse intestine. The median protein half-life is shorter in the small intestine than in the colon. Differences in protein turnover rates along the intestinal tract can be explained by distinct physiological and immune-related functions between the small and large intestine. An absence of microbiota results in an approximately 1 day longer protein half-life in germ-free animals.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) contributes to transcriptome complexity by generating mRNA isoforms with varying 3′ UTR lengths. APA leading to 3′ UTR shortening (3′ US) is a common feature of most cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanisms are not understood. Here, we describe a widespread mechanism promoting 3′ US in cancer through ubiquitination of the mRNA 3′ end processing complex protein, PCF11, by the cancer-specific MAGE-A11–HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase. MAGE-A11 is normally expressed only in the male germline but is frequently re-activated in cancers. MAGE-A11 is necessary for cancer cell viability and is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. Screening for targets of MAGE-A11 revealed that it ubiquitinates PCF11, resulting in loss of CFIm25 from the mRNA 3′ end processing complex. This leads to APA of many transcripts affecting core oncogenic and tumor suppressors, including cyclin D2 and PTEN. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms driving APA in cancer and suggest therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: The circadian clock regulates various physiological processes, including bone metabolism. The nuclear receptors Rev-erbs, comprising Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ, play a key role as transcriptional regulators of the circadian clock. In this study, we demonstrate that Rev-erbs negatively regulate differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The knockdown of Rev-erbα in osteoclast precursor cells enhanced receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation, as well as expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The overexpression of Rev-erbα leads to attenuation of the NFATc1 expression via inhibition of recruitment of c-Fos to the NFATc1 promoter. The overexpression of Rev-erbα in osteoblast precursors attenuated the expression of osteoblast marker genes including Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OC). Rev-erbα interfered with the recruitment of Runx2 to the promoter region of the target genes. Conversely, knockdown of Rev-erbα in the osteoblast precursors enhanced the osteoblast differentiation and function. In addition, Rev-erbα negatively regulated osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation by suppressing the p38 MAPK pathway. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of GSK4112, a Rev-erb agonist, protects RANKL-induced bone loss via inhibition of osteoclast differentiation in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate a molecular mechanism of Rev-erbs in the bone remodeling, and provide a molecular basis for a potential therapeutic target for treatment of bone disease characterized by excessive bone resorption.

Abstract: Summary
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that trigger RNase-H-mediated cleavage are commonly used to knock down transcripts for experimental or therapeutic purposes. In particular, ASOs are frequently used to functionally interrogate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and discriminate lncRNA loci that produce functional RNAs from those whose activity is attributable to the act of transcription. Transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of nascent transcripts, generally during polyadenylation, resulting in degradation of the residual RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated RNA by XRN2 and dissociation of elongating Pol II. Here, we show that ASOs act upon nascent transcripts and, consequently, induce premature transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Targeting the transcript 3′ end with ASOs, however, allows transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. These results demonstrate that the effects of ASOs on transcription must be considered for appropriate experimental and therapeutic use of these reagents.

Abstract: Summary
The Warburg effect is one of the metabolic hallmarks of cancer cells, characterized by enhanced glycolysis even under aerobic conditions. This physiological adaptation is associated with metastasis , but we still have a superficial understanding of how it affects cellular processes during embryonic development. Here we report that the neural crest, a migratory stem cell population in vertebrate embryos, undergoes an extensive metabolic remodeling to engage in aerobic glycolysis prior to delamination. This increase in glycolytic flux promotes Yap/Tead signaling, which activates the expression of a set of transcription factors to drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our results demonstrate how shifts in carbon metabolism can trigger the gene regulatory circuits that control complex cell behaviors. These findings support the hypothesis that the Warburg effect is a precisely regulated developmental mechanism that is anomalously reactivated during tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
How repetitive elements, epigenetic modifications, and architectural proteins interact ensuring proper genome expression remains poorly understood. Here, we report regulatory mechanisms unveiling a central role of Alu elements (AEs) and RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) in structurally and functionally modulating the genome via chromatin looping and histone acetylation. Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and expression.

Abstract: Summary
cis-Regulatory communication is crucial in mammalian development and is thought to be restricted by the spatial partitioning of the genome in topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, we discovered that the Xist locus is regulated by sequences in the neighboring TAD. In particular, the promoter of the noncoding RNA Linx (LinxP) acts as a long-range silencer and influences the choice of X chromosome to be inactivated. This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation. When introduced in the same TAD as Xist, LinxP switches from a silencer to an enhancer. Our study uncovers an unsuspected regulatory axis for X chromosome inactivation and a class of cis-regulatory effects that may exploit TAD partitioning to modulate developmental decisions.

Abstract: Summary
The myosin II activator Rho-kinase (Rok) is planar polarized at the tissue boundary of the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland placode through a negative regulation by the apical polarity protein Crumbs that is anisotropically localized at the boundary. However, in inner cells of the placode, both Crumbs and Rok are isotropically enriched at junctions. We propose that modulation of Rok membrane residence time by Crumbs’ downstream effectors can reconcile both behaviors. Using FRAP combined with in silico simulations, we find that the lower membrane dissociation rate (koff) of Rok at the tissue boundary with low Crumbs explains this boundary-specific effect. The S/T kinase Pak1, recruited by Crumbs and Cdc42, negatively affects Rok membrane association in vivo and in vitro can phosphorylate Rok near the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that mediates membrane association. These data reveal an important mechanism of the modulation of Rok membrane residence time via affecting the koff that may be widely employed during tissue morphogenesis.

Abstract: Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the reversible conjugation of a fatty acid (usually C16 palmitate) to intracellular cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester linkage. Palmitoylation anchors intracellular regions of proteins to membranes because the palmitoylated cysteine is recruited to the lipid bilayer. NCX1 is palmitoylated at a single cysteine in its large regulatory intracellular loop. The presence of an amphipathic α-helix immediately adjacent to the NCX1 palmitoylation site is required for NCX1 palmitoylation. The NCX1 palmitoylation site is conserved through most metazoan phlya. Although palmitoylation does not regulate the normal forward or reverse ion transport modes of NCX1, NCX1 palmitoylation is required for its inactivation: sodium-dependent inactivation and inactivation by PIP2 depletion are significantly impaired for unpalmitoylatable NCX1. Here we review the role of palmitoylation in regulating NCX1 activity, and highlight future questions that must be addressed to fully understand the importance of this regulatory mechanism for sodium and calcium transport in cardiac muscle.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of protein homeostasis, through inducible expression of molecular chaperones, is essential for cell survival under protein-damaging conditions. The expression and DNA-binding activity of heat shock factor 2 (HSF2), a member of the heat shock transcription factor family, increase upon exposure to prolonged proteotoxicity. Nevertheless, the specific roles of HSF2 and the global HSF2-dependent gene expression profile during sustained stress have remained unknown. Here, we found that HSF2 is critical for cell survival during prolonged proteotoxicity. Strikingly, our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses revealed that impaired viability of HSF2-deficient cells is not caused by inadequate induction of molecular chaperones but is due to marked downregulation of cadherin superfamily genes. We demonstrate that HSF2-dependent maintenance of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is required for protection against stress induced by proteasome inhibition. This study identifies HSF2 as a key regulator of cadherin superfamily genes and defines cell-cell adhesion as a determinant of proteotoxic stress resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a tick-borne virus with 12%–30% case mortality rates and is related to the Heartland virus (HRTV) identified in the United States. Together, SFTSV and HRTV are emerging segmented, negative-sense RNA viral (sNSV) pathogens with potential global health impact. Here, we characterize the amino-terminal cap-snatching endonuclease domain of SFTSV polymerase (L) and solve a 2.4-Å X-ray crystal structure. While the overall structure is similar to those of other cap-snatching sNSV endonucleases, differences near the C terminus of the SFTSV endonuclease suggest divergence in regulation. Influenza virus endonuclease inhibitors, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Baloxavir (BXA), inhibit the endonuclease activity in in vitro enzymatic assays and in cell-based studies. BXA displays potent activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ∼100 nM in enzyme inhibition and an EC50 value of ∼250 nM against SFTSV and HRTV in plaque assays. Together, our data support sNSV endonucleases as an antiviral target.

Abstract: Summary
Dissecting the in vivo host-pathogen interplay is crucial to understanding the molecular mechanisms governing control or progression of intracellular infections. In this work, we explore the in vivo molecular dynamics of Mtb infection by performing dual RNA-seq on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected, ontogenetically distinct macrophage lineages isolated directly from murine lungs. We first define an in vivo signature of 180 genes specifically upregulated by Mtb in mouse lung macrophages, then we uncover a divergent transcriptional response of the bacteria between alveolar macrophages that appear to sustain Mtb growth through increased access to iron and fatty acids and interstitial macrophages that restrict Mtb growth through iron sequestration and higher levels of nitric oxide. We use an enrichment protocol for bacterial transcripts, which enables us to probe Mtb physiology at the host cell level in an in vivo environment, with broader application in understanding the infection dynamics of intracellular pathogens in general.

Abstract: Summary
Base pairing RNAs modulate gene expression in all studied organisms. In many bacteria, the base pairing between most small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their targets is mediated by the Hfq RNA chaperone. However, recent studies have shown FinO-domain proteins also bind sRNAs. To examine the global contribution of the FinO-domain ProQ protein in Escherichia coli, we carried out RIL-seq to identify RNA pairs bound to this protein. The RNA-RNA interactome for ProQ contains hundreds of pairs. Intriguingly, a significant fraction of the ProQ-bound RNA pairs are also found associated with Hfq, indicating overlapping, complementary, or competing roles for the two proteins. Characterization of one novel RNA pair bound by both chaperones revealed that while Hfq is required for RNA sponge-mediated downregulation of the sRNA, ProQ can inhibit this regulation. Overall, our results uncover increased complexity in RNA regulatory networks involving RNA chaperone proteins, RNases, sRNAs, and mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexan parasites are unicellular eukaryotic pathogens that must obtain and combine lipids from both host cell scavenging and de novo synthesis to maintain parasite propagation and survival within their human host. Major questions on the role and regulation of each lipid source upon fluctuating host nutritional conditions remain unanswered. Characterization of an apicoplast acyltransferase, TgATS2, shows that the apicoplast provides (lyso)phosphatidic acid, required for the recruitment of a critical dynamin (TgDrpC) during parasite cytokinesis. Disruption of TgATS2 also leads parasites to shift metabolic lipid acquisition from de novo synthesis toward host scavenging. We show that both lipid scavenging and de novo synthesis pathways in wild-type parasites exhibit major metabolic and cellular plasticity upon sensing host lipid-deprived environments through concomitant (1) upregulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis capacities in the apicoplast and (2) parasite-driven host remodeling to generate multi-membrane-bound structures from host organelles that are imported toward the parasite.

Abstract: Summary
More than one-half of the interneurons in a mouse olfactory bulb (OB) develop during the first week after birth and predominantly connect to excitatory tufted cells near the superficial granule cell layer (sGCL), unlike late-born interneurons. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the temporal specification are yet to be identified. In this study, we determined the role of Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1 (Abl1) in the temporal development of early-born OB interneurons. Lentiviral knockdown of Abl1 disrupts the sGCL circuit of early-born interneurons through defects in function and circuit integration, resulting in olfactory hyper-sensitivity. We show that doublecortin (Dcx) is phosphorylated by Abl1, which contributes to the stabilization of Dcx, thereby regulating microtubule dynamics. Finally, Dcx overexpression rescues Abl1 knockdown-induced anatomic or functional defects. In summary, specific signaling by Abl1-Dcx in early-born interneurons facilitates the temporal development of the sGCL circuit to regulate innate olfactory functions, such as detection and sensitivity.

Abstract: The red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) is an endangered, large-bodied crane native to East Asia. It is a traditional symbol of longevity and its long lifespan has been confirmed both in captivity and in the wild. Lifespan in birds is known to be positively correlated with body size and negatively correlated with metabolic rate, though the genetic mechanisms for the red-crowned crane’s long lifespan have not previously been investigated. Using whole genome sequencing and comparative evolutionary analyses against the grey-crowned crane and other avian genomes, including the long-lived common ostrich, we identified red-crowned crane candidate genes with known associations with longevity. Among these are positively selected genes in metabolism and immunity pathways (NDUFA5, NDUFA8, NUDT12, SOD3, CTH, RPA1, PHAX, HNMT, HS2ST1, PPCDC, PSTK CD8B, GP9, IL-9R, and PTPRC). Our analyses provide genetic evidence for low metabolic rate and longevity, accompanied by possible convergent adaptation signatures among distantly related large and long-lived birds. Finally, we identified low genetic diversity in the red-crowned crane, consistent with its listing as an endangered species, and this genome should provide a useful genetic resource for future conservation studies of this rare and iconic species.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modulates mRNA fate and thus affects many biological processes. We analyzed m6A across the transcriptome following infection by dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that infection by these viruses in the Flaviviridae family alters m6A modification of specific cellular transcripts, including RIOK3 and CIRBP. During viral infection, the addition of m6A to RIOK3 promotes its translation, while loss of m6A in CIRBP promotes alternative splicing. Importantly, viral activation of innate immune sensing or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response contributes to the changes in m6A in RIOK3 or CIRBP, respectively. Further, several transcripts with infection-altered m6A profiles, including RIOK3 and CIRBP, encode proteins that influence DENV, ZIKV, and HCV infection. Overall, this work reveals that cellular signaling pathways activated during viral infection lead to alterations in m6A modification of host mRNAs to regulate infection.

Abstract: It is well established that mitochondria are the main source of ATP production within cells. However, mitochondria have other remarkable functions, serving as important modulators of cellular Ca2+ signaling, and it is now generally recognized that control over Ca2+ homeostasis is intrinsically interwoven with mitochondrial abilities to adjust and tune ATP production. In this review, we describe the mechanisms that mitochondria use to balance Ca2+ homeostasis maintenance and cell energy metabolism. In recent years, the knowledge on the molecular machinery mediating Ca2+ influx/efflux has been improved and, albeit still open to further investigations, several lines of evidence converge on the hypothesis that plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) isoforms are also expressed at the mitochondrial level, where they contribute to the Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis maintenance. In particular, the connection between mitochondrial NCX activity and metabolic substrates utilization is further discussed here. We also briefly focus on the alterations of both mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and cellular bioenergetics in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
HMCES (5hmC binding, embryonic stem cell-specific-protein), originally identified as a protein capable of binding 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an epigenetic modification generated by TET proteins, was previously reported to covalently crosslink to DNA at abasic sites via a conserved cysteine. We show here that Hmces-deficient mice display normal hematopoiesis without global alterations in 5hmC. HMCES specifically enables DNA double-strand break repair through the microhomology-mediated alternative-end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway during class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, and HMCES deficiency leads to a significant defect in CSR. HMCES mediates Alt-EJ through its SOS-response-associated-peptidase domain (SRAPd), a function that requires DNA binding but is independent of its autopeptidase and DNA-crosslinking activities. We show that HMCES is recruited to switch regions of the immunoglobulin locus and provide a potential structural basis for the interaction of HMCES with long DNA overhangs generated by Alt-EJ during CSR. Our studies provide further evidence for a specialized role for HMCES in DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity. Serine stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and feeds into the one-carbon metabolic network (1CMet) essential for effector T cell (Teff) responses. However, serine’s functions, linkage to GSH, and role in stress responses in Tregs are unknown. Here, we show, using mice with Treg-specific ablation of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclc), that GSH loss in Tregs alters serine import and synthesis and that the integrity of this feedback loop is critical for Treg suppressive capacity. Although Gclc ablation does not impair Treg differentiation, mutant mice exhibit severe autoimmunity and enhanced anti-tumor responses. Gclc-deficient Tregs show increased serine metabolism, mTOR activation, and proliferation but downregulated FoxP3. Limitation of cellular serine in vitro and in vivo restores FoxP3 expression and suppressive capacity of Gclc-deficient Tregs. Our work reveals an unexpected role for GSH in restricting serine availability to preserve Treg functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial fusion is a key process of morphogenesis by which tissue connectivity is established between adjacent epithelial sheets. A striking and poorly understood feature of this process is “zippering,” whereby a fusion point moves directionally along an organ rudiment. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying zippering during mouse spinal neural tube closure. Fusion is initiated via local activation of integrin β1 and focal anchorage of surface ectoderm cells to a shared point of fibronectin-rich basement membrane, where the neural folds first contact each other. Surface ectoderm cells undergo proximal junction shortening, establishing a transitory semi-rosette-like structure at the zippering point that promotes juxtaposition of cells across the midline enabling fusion propagation. Tissue-specific ablation of integrin β1 abolishes the semi-rosette formation, preventing zippering and causing spina bifida. We propose integrin-mediated anchorage as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of general relevance for zippering closure of epithelial gaps whose disturbance can produce clinically important birth defects.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as a leading cause of chronic liver disease. However, therapeutic options are limited by incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of NASH fibrosis, which is mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In humans, human genetic studies have shown that hypomorphic variations in MERTK, encoding the macrophage c-mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptor, provide protection against liver fibrosis, but the mechanisms remain unknown. We now show that holo- or myeloid-specific Mertk targeting in NASH mice decreases liver fibrosis, congruent with the human genetic data. Furthermore, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated MerTK cleavage in liver macrophages decreases during steatosis to NASH transition, and mice with a cleavage-resistant MerTK mutant have increased NASH fibrosis. Macrophage MerTK promotes an ERK-TGFβ1 pathway that activates HSCs and induces liver fibrosis. These data provide insights into the role of liver macrophages in NASH fibrosis and provide a plausible mechanism underlying MERTK as a genetic risk factor for NASH fibrosis.

Abstract: A precise temporal and spatial control of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is essential for a coordinated contraction of the heart. Following contraction, cardiac cells need to rapidly remove intracellular Ca2+ to allow for relaxation. This task is performed by two transporters: the plasma membrane Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+‐ATPase (SERCA). NCX extrudes Ca2+ from the cell, balancing the Ca2+entering the cytoplasm during systole through L-type Ca2+ channels. In parallel, following SR Ca2+ release, SERCA activity replenishes the SR, reuptaking Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. The activity of the mammalian exchanger is fine-tuned by numerous ionic allosteric regulatory mechanisms. Micromolar concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ potentiate NCX activity, while an increase in intracellular Na+ levels inhibits NCX via a mechanism known as Na+-dependent inactivation. Protons are also powerful inhibitors of NCX activity. By regulating NCX activity, Ca2+, Na+ and H+ couple cell metabolism to Ca2+ homeostasis and therefore cardiac contractility. This review summarizes the recent progress towards the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the ionic regulation of the cardiac NCX with special emphasis on pH modulation and its physiological impact on the heart.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic mutations in either one of the epigenetic modifiers EHMT1, MBD5, MLL3, or SMARCB1 have been identified to be causative for Kleefstra syndrome spectrum (KSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features of both intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To understand how these variants lead to the phenotypic convergence in KSS, we employ a loss-of-function approach to assess neuronal network development at the molecular, single-cell, and network activity level. KSS-gene-deficient neuronal networks all develop into hyperactive networks with altered network organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Interestingly, even though transcriptional data reveal distinct regulatory mechanisms, KSS target genes share similar functions in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic function, several of which are associated with ID and ASD. Our results show that KSS genes mainly converge at the level of neuronal network communication, providing insights into the pathophysiology of KSS and phenotypically congruent disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Cannabinoids are reported to rescue cocaine-induced seizures (CISs), a severe complication in cocaine users. However, the molecular targets for cannabinoid therapy of CISs remain unclear. Here, we report that the systemic administration of cannabinoids alleviates CISs in a CB1/CB2-receptor-independent manner. In HEK293 cells and cortical neurons, cocaine-induced dysfunction of the glycine receptor (GlyR) is restored by cannabinoids. Such restoration is blocked by GlyRα1S296A mutation. Consistently, the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids on CISs are also eliminated in GlyRα1S296A mutant mice. Based on molecular dynamic simulation, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between cocaine and the GlyR is weakened by cannabinoid docking. Without altering cocaine distribution across the brain, cannabinoids significantly suppress cocaine-exaggerated neuronal excitability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus by rehabilitating extra-synaptic GlyR function. Microinjection of cannabinoids into the PFC and hippocampus restores cocaine-puzzled neural activity and alleviates CISs. These findings suggest that using GlyR-hypersensitive cannabinoids may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating CISs.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional programming of the innate immune response is pivotal for host protection. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that link pathogen sensing with innate activation remain poorly understood. During HIV-1 infection, human dendritic cells (DCs) can detect the virus through an innate sensing pathway, leading to antiviral interferon and DC maturation. Here, we develop an iterative experimental and computational approach to map the HIV-1 innate response circuitry in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). By integrating genome-wide chromatin accessibility with expression kinetics, we infer a gene regulatory network that links 542 transcription factors with 21,862 target genes. We observe that an interferon response is required, yet insufficient, to drive MDDC maturation and identify PRDM1 and RARA as essential regulators of the interferon response and MDDC maturation, respectively. Our work provides a resource for interrogation of regulators of HIV replication and innate immunity, highlighting complexity and cooperativity in the regulatory circuit controlling the response to infection.

Abstract: Summary
As pH is fundamental to all biological processes, pH-responsive bacterial genetic circuits enable precise sensing in any environment. Where the unintentional release of engineered bacteria poses a concern, coupling pH sensing to the expression of a toxin creates an effective bacterial containment system. Here, we present a pH-sensitive kill switch (acidic termination of replicating population [acidTRP]), based on the Escherichia coli asr promoter, with a survival ratio of <1 in 106. We integrate acidTRP with cryodeath to produce a 2-factor containment system with a combined survival ratio of <1 in 1011 while maintaining evolutionary stability. We further develop a pulse-counting circuit with single-cell readout for each administered stimulus pulse. We use this pulse counter to record multiple pH changes and combine it with acidTRP to make a 2-count acid-sensitive kill switch. These results demonstrate the ability to build complex genetic systems for biological containment.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression that base pair with complementary sequences on target mRNAs, often in association with the chaperone Hfq. Here, using experimentally identified sRNA-target pairs, along with gene expression measurements, we assess basic principles of regulation by sRNAs. We show that the sRNA sequence dictates the target repertoire, as point mutations in the sRNA shift the target set correspondingly. We distinguish two subsets of targets: targets showing changes in expression levels under overexpression of their sRNA regulator and unaffected targets that interact more sporadically with the sRNA. These differences among targets are associated with their Hfq occupancy, rather than with the sRNA-target base-pairing potential. Our results suggest that competition among targets over Hfq binding plays a major role in the regulatory outcome, possibly awarding targets with higher Hfq binding efficiency an advantage in the competition over binding to the sRNA.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss. To better understand disease pathogenesis and identify causal genes in GWAS loci for AMD risk, we present a comprehensive database of human retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Our database comprises macular and non-macular RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from 129 donors, a genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset that includes macula-specific retina and RPE/choroid, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (NucSeq) from human retina and RPE with subtype resolution from more than 100,000 cells. Using NucSeq, we find enriched expression of AMD candidate genes in RPE cells. We identify 15 putative causal genes for AMD on the basis of co-localization of genetic association signals for AMD risk and eye eQTL, including the genes TSPAN10 and TRPM1. These results demonstrate the value of our human eye database for elucidating genetic pathways and potential therapeutic targets for ocular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The propagation of species depends on the ability of germ cells to protect their genome from numerous exogenous and endogenous threats. While these cells employ ubiquitous repair pathways, specialized mechanisms that ensure high-fidelity replication, chromosome segregation, and repair of germ cell genomes remain incompletely understood. We identified Germ Cell Nuclear Acidic Peptidase (GCNA) as a conserved regulator of genome stability in flies, worms, zebrafish, and human germ cell tumors. GCNA contains an acidic intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a protease-like SprT domain. In addition to chromosomal instability and replication stress, Gcna mutants accumulate DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs). GCNA acts in parallel with the SprT domain protein Spartan. Structural analysis reveals that while the SprT domain is needed to limit DNA damage, the IDR imparts significant function. This work shows that GCNA protects germ cells from various sources of damage, providing insights into conserved mechanisms that promote genome integrity across generations.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of cellular protein synthesis is linked to a variety of diseases. Mutations in EIF2S3, encoding the γ subunit of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, cause MEHMO syndrome, an X-linked intellectual disability disorder. Here, using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, we show that a mutation at the C terminus of eIF2γ impairs CDC123 promotion of eIF2 complex formation and decreases the level of eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes. This reduction in eIF2 activity results in dysregulation of global and gene-specific protein synthesis and enhances cell death upon stress induction. Addition of the drug ISRIB, an activator of the eIF2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, rescues the cell growth, translation, and neuronal differentiation defects associated with the EIF2S3 mutation, offering the possibility of therapeutic intervention for MEHMO syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic prostate cancer is characterized by recurrent genomic copy number alterations that are presumed to contribute to resistance to hormone therapy. We identified CHD1 loss as a cause of antiandrogen resistance in an in vivo small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of 730 genes deleted in prostate cancer. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses showed that CHD1 loss resulted in global changes in open and closed chromatin with associated transcriptomic changes. Integrative analysis of this data, together with CRISPR-based functional screening, identified four transcription factors (NR3C1, POU3F2, NR2F1, and TBX2) that contribute to antiandrogen resistance, with associated activation of non-luminal lineage programs. Thus, CHD1 loss results in chromatin dysregulation, thereby establishing a state of transcriptional plasticity that enables the emergence of antiandrogen resistance through heterogeneous mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian heart contains multiple cell types that appear progressively during embryonic development. Advance in determining cardiac lineage diversification has often been limited by the unreliability of genetic tracers. Here we combine clonal analysis, genetic lineage tracing, tissue transplantation, and mutant characterization to investigate the lineage relationships between epicardium, arterial mesothelial cells (AMCs), and the coronary vasculature. We report a contribution of the second heart field (SHF) to a vasculogenic niche composed of AMCs and sub-mesothelial cells at the base of the pulmonary artery. Sub-mesothelial cells from this niche differentiate into lymphatic endothelial cells and, in close association with AMC-derived cells, contribute to and are essential for the development of ventral cardiac lymphatics. In addition, regionalized epicardial/mesothelial retinoic acid signaling regulates lymphangiogenesis, contributing to the niche properties. These results uncover a SHF vasculogenic contribution to coronary lymphatic development through a local niche at the base of the great arteries.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (Bregs) in response to gut-microbiota-derived signals supports the maintenance of tolerance. However, whether microbiota-derived metabolites can modulate Breg suppressive function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and arthritic mice have a reduction in microbial-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compared to healthy controls and that in mice, supplementation with the SCFA butyrate reduces arthritis severity. Butyrate supplementation suppresses arthritis in a Breg-dependent manner by increasing the level of the serotonin-derived metabolite 5-Hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), which activates the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a newly discovered transcriptional marker for Breg function. Thus, butyrate supplementation via AhR activation controls a molecular program that supports Breg function while inhibiting germinal center (GC) B cell and plasmablast differentiation. Our study demonstrates that butyrate supplementation may serve as a viable therapy for the amelioration of systemic autoimmune disorders.

Abstract: Summary
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play subunit-specific roles in synaptic function and are implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the in vivo consequences and therapeutic potential of pharmacologically enhancing NMDAR function via allosteric modulation are largely unknown. We examine the in vivo effects of GNE-0723, a positive allosteric modulator of GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDARs, on brain network and cognitive functions in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). GNE-0723 use dependently potentiates synaptic NMDA receptor currents and reduces brain oscillation power with a predominant effect on low-frequency (12–20 Hz) oscillations. Interestingly, DS and AD mouse models display aberrant low-frequency oscillatory power that is tightly correlated with network hypersynchrony. GNE-0723 treatment reduces aberrant low-frequency oscillations and epileptiform discharges and improves cognitive functions in DS and AD mouse models. GluN2A-subunit-containing NMDAR enhancers may have therapeutic benefits in brain disorders with network hypersynchrony and cognitive impairments.

Abstract: Mitochondrial free calcium is critically linked to the regulation of cellular metabolism. Free ionic calcium concentration within these organelles is determined by the interplay between two processes: exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane and calcium-buffering within the matrix. During stimulated calcium uptake, calcium is primarily buffered by orthophosphate, preventing calcium toxicity while allowing for well-regulated yet elevated calcium loads. However, if limited to orthophosphates only, this buffering system is expected to lead to the irreversible formation of insoluble precipitates, which are not observed in living cells, under physiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate that the regulation of free mitochondrial calcium requires the presence of free inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) within the organelle. We found that the overexpression of a mitochondrial-targeted enzyme hydrolyzing polyP leads to the loss of the cellular ability to maintain elevated calcium concentrations within the organelle, following stimulated cytoplasmic signal. We hypothesize that the presence of polyP prevents the formation of calcium-phosphate insoluble clusters, allowing for the maintenance of elevated free calcium levels, during stimulated calcium uptake.

Abstract: Summary
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine that reduces food intake through activation of hindbrain GFRAL-RET receptors and has become a keen target of interest for anti-obesity therapies. Elevated endogenous GDF15 is associated with energy balance disturbances, cancer progression, chemotherapy-induced anorexia, and morning sickness. We hypothesized that GDF15 causes emesis and that its anorectic effects are related to this function. Here, we examined feeding and emesis and/or emetic-like behaviors in three different mammalian laboratory species to help elucidate the role of GDF15 in these behaviors. Data show that GDF15 causes emesis in Suncus murinus (musk shrews) and induces behaviors indicative of nausea/malaise (e.g., anorexia and pica) in non-emetic species, including mice and lean or obese rats. We also present data in mice suggesting that GDF15 contributes to chemotherapy-induced malaise. Together, these results indicate that GDF15 triggers anorexia through the induction of nausea and/or by engaging emetic neurocircuitry.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells rely on altered metabolism to support abnormal proliferation. We performed a CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomic screen targeting metabolic enzymes and identified PDXK—an enzyme that produces pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) from vitamin B6—as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-selective dependency. PDXK kinase activity is required for PLP production and AML cell proliferation, and pharmacological blockade of the vitamin B6 pathway at both PDXK and PLP levels recapitulated PDXK disruption effects. PDXK disruption reduced intracellular concentrations of key metabolites needed for cell division. Furthermore, disruption of PLP-dependent enzymes ODC1 or GOT2 selectively inhibited AML cell proliferation and their downstream products partially rescued PDXK disruption induced proliferation blockage. Our work identifies the vitamin B6 pathway as a pharmacologically actionable dependency in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is an immunosuppressive cytokine composed of Epstein-Barr-virus-induced protein 3 (Ebi3) and IL-12α chain (p35) subunits, yet the forms that IL-35 assume and its role in peripheral tolerance remain elusive. We induce CBA-specific, IL-35-producing T regulatory (Treg) cells in TregEbi3WT C57BL/6 reporter mice and identify IL-35 producers by expression of Ebi3TdTom gene reporter plus Ebi3 and p35 proteins. Curiously, both subunits of IL-35 are displayed on the surface of tolerogen-specific Foxp3+ and Foxp3neg (iTr35) T cells. Furthermore, IL-35 producers, although rare, secrete Ebi3 and p35 on extracellular vesicles (EVs) targeting a 25- to 100-fold higher number of T and B lymphocytes, causing them to acquire surface IL-35. This surface IL-35 is absent when EV production is inhibited or if Ebi3 is genetically deleted in Treg cells. The unique ability of EVs to coat bystander lymphocytes with IL-35, promoting exhaustion in, and secondary suppression by, non-Treg cells identifies a novel mechanism of infectious tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Trypanosoma brucei evades mammalian immunity by using recombination to switch its surface-expressed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), while ensuring that only one of many subtelomeric multigene VSG expression sites are transcribed at a time. DNA repair activities have been implicated in the catalysis of VSG switching by recombination, not transcriptional control. How VSG switching is signaled to guide the appropriate reaction or to integrate switching into parasite growth is unknown. Here, we show that the loss of ATR, a DNA damage-signaling protein kinase, is lethal, causing nuclear genome instability and increased VSG switching through VSG-localized damage. Furthermore, ATR loss leads to the increased transcription of silent VSG expression sites and expression of mixed VSGs on the cell surface, effects that are associated with the altered localization of RNA polymerase I and VEX1. This work shows that ATR acts in antigenic variation both through DNA damage signaling and surface antigen expression control.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with the intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the accumulation of β-amyloid in the neocortex. We use transgenic mice harboring human tau (rTg4510) and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate transcriptional changes associated with the progression of tau and amyloid pathology. rTg4510 mice are characterized by widespread transcriptional differences in the entorhinal cortex with changes paralleling neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions. Differentially expressed transcripts overlap with genes identified in genetic studies of familial and sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses identify discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive accumulation of tau that are enriched for genes and pathways previously implicated in AD pathology and overlap with co-expression networks identified in human AD cortex. Our data provide further evidence for an immune-response component in the accumulation of tau and reveal molecular pathways associated with the progression of AD neuropathology.

Abstract: Summary
The cross-talk between mesenchymal stem and stromal cells (MSCs) and macrophages is critical for the restoration of tissue homeostasis after injury. Here, we demonstrate a pathway through which MSCs instruct macrophages to resolve inflammation and preserve tissue-specific stem cells, leading to homeostasis in mice with autoimmune uveoretinitis and sterile-injury-induced corneal epithelial stem cell deficiency. Distinct from their conventional role in macrophage reprogramming to anti-inflammatory phenotype by a PGE2-dependent mechanism, MSCs enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, which partly depends on the uptake of MSC mitochondria-containing extracellular vesicles. The MSC-primed macrophages increase the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG) in a phagocytosis-dependent manner. AREG is essential for MSC-primed macrophages to suppress immune responses through regulatory T (Treg) cells and to protect corneal epithelial stem cells via apoptosis inhibition and proliferation promotion. Hence, the data reveal that MSCs harness macrophage-derived AREG to maintain tissue homeostasis after injury and provide a therapeutic target in immune-mediated disease and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Endomembrane damage elicits homeostatic responses including ESCRT-dependent membrane repair and autophagic removal of damaged organelles. Previous studies have suggested that these systems may act separately. Here, we show that galectin-3 (Gal3), a β-galactoside-binding cytosolic lectin, unifies and coordinates ESCRT and autophagy responses to lysosomal damage. Gal3 and its capacity to recognize damage-exposed glycans were required for efficient recruitment of the ESCRT component ALIX during lysosomal damage. Both Gal3 and ALIX were required for restoration of lysosomal function. Gal3 promoted interactions between ALIX and the downstream ESCRT-III effector CHMP4 during lysosomal repair. At later time points following lysosomal injury, Gal3 controlled autophagic responses. When this failed, as in Gal3 knockout cells, lysosomal replacement program took over through TFEB. Manifestations of this staged response, which includes membrane repair, removal, and replacement, were detected in model systems of lysosomal damage inflicted by proteopathic tau and during phagosome parasitism by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Abstract: Cell membranes spatially define gradients that drive the complexity of biological signals. To guarantee movements and exchanges of solutes between compartments, membrane transporters negotiate the passages of ions and other important molecules through lipid bilayers. The Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) in particular play central roles in balancing Na+ and Ca2+ fluxes across diverse proteolipid borders in all eukaryotic cells, influencing cellular functions and fate by multiple means. To prevent progression from balance to disease, redundant regulatory mechanisms cooperate at multiple levels (transcriptional, translational, and post-translational) and guarantee that the activities of NCXs are finely-tuned to cell homeostatic requirements. When this regulatory network is disturbed by pathological forces, cells may approach the end of life. In this review, we will discuss the main findings, controversies and open questions about regulatory mechanisms that control NCX functions in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation triggered by infection or cellular necrosis is initiated by a battery of pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors or IL-1 family receptors. Diverse forms of cell stress, such as ER stress or mitochondrial stress, can also promote inflammatory responses that contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in cancer, obesity, and other conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms of cell-stress-induced inflammation are poorly understood. Here, we show that ER stress initiated NF-κB activation and inflammation through transcriptional upregulation and ligand-independent activation of TRAIL receptors. ER-stress-induced TRAIL receptor activation resulted in caspase-8/FADD/RIPK1-dependent NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine production. Silencing or deletion of TRAIL receptors, or their downstream effectors caspase-8, FADD, or RIPK1, suppressed ER-stress-induced inflammation. Furthermore, chemotherapeutic stress-induced inflammatory responses were blunted in DR5/TRAIL-R null animals. We propose that, upon ER stress, TRAIL receptors serve as “stress-associated molecular patterns (SAMPs)” coupling ER stress to NF-κB-dependent inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Many studies have suggested a role for gut-resident microbes (the “gut microbiome”) in modulating host health; however, the mechanisms by which they impact systemic physiology remain largely unknown. In this study, metabolomic and transcriptional profiling of germ-free and conventionalized mouse liver revealed an upregulation of the Nrf2 antioxidant and xenobiotic response in microbiome-replete animals. Using a Drosophila-based screening assay, we identified members of the genus Lactobacillus capable of stimulating Nrf2. Indeed, the human commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) potently activated Nrf2 in the Drosophila liver analog and the murine liver. This activation was sufficient to protect against two models of oxidative liver injury, acetaminophen overdose and acute ethanol toxicity. Characterization of the portal circulation of LGG-treated mice by tandem mass spectrometry identified a small molecule activator of Nrf2, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, produced by LGG. Taken together, these data demonstrate a mechanism by which intestinal microbes modulate hepatic susceptibility to oxidative injury.

Divalent cation influx and calcium homeostasis in germinal vesicle mouse oocytes,

Abstract: Prior to maturation, mouse oocytes are arrested at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage during which they experience constitutive calcium (Ca2+) influx and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. The oscillations cease during maturation but Ca2+ influx continues, as the oocytes’ internal stores attain maximal content at the culmination of maturation, the metaphase II stage. The identity of the channel(s) that underlie this Ca2+ influx has not been completely determined. GV and matured oocytes are known to express three Ca2+ channels, CaV3.2, TRPV3 and TRPM7, but females null for each of these channels are fertile and their oocytes display minor modifications in Ca2+ homeostasis, suggesting a complex regulation of Ca2+ influx. To define the contribution of these channels at the GV stage, we used different divalent cations, pharmacological inhibitors and genetic models. We found that the three channels are active at this stage. CaV3.2 and TRPM7 channels contributed the majority of Ca2+ influx, as inhibitors and oocytes from homologous knockout (KO) lines showed severely reduced Ca2+ entry. Sr2+ influx was promoted by CaV3.2 channels, as Sr2+ oscillations were negligible in CaV3.2-KO oocytes but robust in control and Trpv3-KO GV oocytes. Mn2+ entry relied on expression of CaV3.2 and TRPM7 channels, but Ni2+ entry depended on the latter. CaV3.2 and TRPV3 channels combined to fill the Ca2+ stores, although CaV3.2 was the most impactful. Studies with pharmacological inhibitors effectively blocked the influx of divalent cations, but displayed off-target effects, and occasionally agonist-like properties. In conclusion, GV oocytes express channels mediating Ca2+ and other divalent cation influx that are pivotal for fertilization and early development. These channels may serve as targets for intervention to improve the success of assisted reproductive technologies.

Abstract: Summary
In response to DNA double-strand breaks, MAD2L2-containing shieldin complex plays a critical role in the choice between homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair. Here we show that EZH2 inhibition upregulates MAD2L2 and sensitizes HR-proficient epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in a CARM1-dependent manner. CARM1 promotes MAD2L2 silencing by driving the switch from the SWI/SNF complex to EZH2 through methylating the BAF155 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex on the MAD2L2 promoter. EZH2 inhibition upregulates MAD2L2 to decrease DNA end resection, which increases NHEJ and chromosomal abnormalities, ultimately causing mitotic catastrophe in PARP inhibitor treated HR-proficient cells. Significantly, EZH2 inhibitor sensitizes CARM1-high, but not CARM-low, EOCs to PARP inhibitors in both orthotopic and patient-derived xenografts.

Abstract: The liver hosts numerous vital functions, such as biotransformation and excretion of xenobiotics. Synthetic oestrogens influence liver structure and function, leading to adaptations or to dysfunctions/injury. They are often stated to induce increases in fish liver weight, but there is controversy regarding how: if by changes in hepatocyte size (hypertrophy) and/or number (hyperplasia). Using platyfish as the experimental model, our primary aim was to assess if/how hepatocytes reacted to a sub-acute oestrogenic exposure. A complementary aim was to generate fundamental structural data for the liver of that model organism. Adult males were injected intramuscularly with 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) (25 μg/g), every 72 h for two weeks. Control fish were given solvent only. Body and liver morphometry were registered, and hepatocytes examined through histology and stereology at light microscopy. Immunohistochemistry evaluated hepatocytic vitellogenin (VTG) content. Treated and control fish did not differ as to quantitative parameters. Nevertheless, exposed fish were sensitive to EE2. VTG tagging was positive in their hepatocytes and these tended to be more basophilic, though not fully oestrogenized. We hypothesise that the platyfish liver is not particularly sensitive to the disrupting action of EE2 because of its reproductive mode; with no production peaks of VTG and no huge changes in endogenous sex-steroids. The fish may have had no evolutionary pressure for hepatocytes to be particularly reactive to oestradiol (E2). In the end, this study offers the first unbiased estimation of the liver cellularity in the platyfish, as well of the hepatocytic volume, serving now as a baseline reference.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium sporozoites infect the liver and develop into exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate blood-stage disease. The hepatocyte molecular pathways that permit or abrogate parasite replication and merozoite formation have not been thoroughly explored, and a deeper understanding may identify therapeutic strategies to mitigate malaria. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins regulate cell survival and are co-opted by intracellular pathogens to support development. Here, we show that cIAP1 levels are upregulated during Plasmodium liver infection and that genetic or pharmacological targeting of cIAPs using clinical-stage antagonists preferentially kills infected hepatocytes and promotes immunity. Using gene-targeted mice, the mechanism was defined as TNF-TNFR1-mediated apoptosis via caspases 3 and 8 to clear parasites. This study reveals the importance of cIAPs to Plasmodium infection and demonstrates that host-directed antimalarial drugs can eliminate liver parasites and induce immunity while likely providing a high barrier to resistance in the parasite.

Abstract: Summary
Despite substantial clinical benefit of targeted and immune checkpoint blockade-based therapies in melanoma, resistance inevitably develops. We show cytoskeletal remodeling and changes in expression and activity of ROCK-myosin II pathway during acquisition of resistance to MAPK inhibitors. MAPK regulates myosin II activity, but after initial therapy response, drug-resistant clones restore myosin II activity to increase survival. High ROCK-myosin II activity correlates with aggressiveness, identifying targeted therapy- and immunotherapy-resistant melanomas. Survival of resistant cells is myosin II dependent, regardless of the therapy. ROCK-myosin II ablation specifically kills resistant cells via intrinsic lethal reactive oxygen species and unresolved DNA damage and limits extrinsic myeloid and lymphoid immunosuppression. Efficacy of targeted therapies and immunotherapies can be improved by combination with ROCK inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Timely completion of DNA replication is central to accurate cell division and to the maintenance of genomic stability. However, certain DNA-protein interactions can physically impede DNA replication fork progression. Cells remove or bypass these physical impediments by different mechanisms to preserve DNA macromolecule integrity and genome stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wss1, the DNA-protein crosslink repair protease, allows cells to tolerate hydroxyurea-induced replication stress, but the underlying mechanism by which Wss1 promotes this function has remained unknown. Here, we report that Wss1 provides cells tolerance to replication stress by directly degrading core histone subunits that non-specifically and non-covalently bind to single-stranded DNA. Unlike Wss1-dependent proteolysis of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks, proteolysis of histones does not require Cdc48 nor SUMO-binding activities. Wss1 thus acts as a multi-functional protease capable of targeting a broad range of covalent and non-covalent DNA-binding proteins to preserve genome stability during adverse conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Prions of lower eukaryotes are self-templating protein aggregates with cores formed by parallel in-register beta strands. Short aggregation-prone glutamine (Q)- and asparagine (N)-rich regions embedded in longer disordered domains have been proposed to act as nucleation sites that initiate refolding of soluble prion proteins into highly ordered fibrils, termed amyloid. We demonstrate that a short Q/N-rich peptide corresponding to a proposed nucleation site in the prototype Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion protein Sup35 is sufficient to induce infectious cytosolic prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing the soluble Sup35 NM prion domain. Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency. Our data suggest that large disordered sequences flanking an aggregation core in prion proteins act as not only solubilizers of the monomeric protein but also breakers of the formed amyloid fibrils, enhancing infectivity of the prion seeds.

Abstract: Summary
Otx family homeoproteins Otx2 and Crx are expressed in photoreceptor precursor cells and bind to the common DNA-binding consensus sequence, but these two proteins have distinct functions in retinal development. To examine the functional substitutability of Otx2 and Crx, we generate knockin mouse lines in which Crx is replaced by Otx2 and vice versa. We find that Otx2 and Crx cannot be substituted in photoreceptor development. Subsequently, we investigate the function of Otx2 in photoreceptor and bipolar cell development. High Otx2 levels induce photoreceptor cell fate but not bipolar cell fate, whereas reduced Otx2 expression impairs bipolar cell maturation and survival. Furthermore, we identify Otx2 and Crx in the lamprey genome by using synteny analysis, suggesting that the last common ancestor of vertebrates possesses both Otx2 and Crx. We find that the retinal Otx2 expression pattern is different between lampreys and mice, suggesting that neofunctionalization of Otx2 occurred in the jawed vertebrate lineage.

Abstract: Summary
HIRA is a histone chaperone that deposits the histone variant H3.3 in transcriptionally active genes. In DiGeorge syndromes, a DNA stretch encompassing HIRA is deleted. The syndromes manifest varied abnormalities, including immunodeficiency and thrombocytopenia. HIRA is essential in mice, as total knockout (KO) results in early embryonic death. However, the role of HIRA in hematopoiesis is poorly understood. We investigate hematopoietic cell-specific Hira deletion in mice and show that it dramatically reduces bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. In contrast, fetal hematopoiesis is normal in Hira-KO mice, although fetal HSCs lack the reconstitution capacity. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HIRA is required for expression of many transcription factors and signaling molecules critical for HSCs. ATAC-seq analysis demonstrates that HIRA establishes HSC-specific DNA accessibility, including the SPIB/PU.1 sites. Together, HIRA provides a chromatin environment essential for HSCs, thereby steering their development and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a cofactor for hundreds of metabolic reactions in all cell types, plays an essential role in metabolism, DNA repair, and aging. However, how NAD metabolism is impacted by the environment remains unclear. Here, we report an unexpected trans-kingdom cooperation between bacteria and mammalian cells wherein bacteria contribute to host NAD biosynthesis. Bacteria confer resistance to inhibitors of NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the amidated NAD salvage pathway, in cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, a microbial nicotinamidase (PncA) that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a precursor in the alternative deamidated NAD salvage pathway, is necessary and sufficient for this protective effect. Using stable isotope tracing and microbiota-depleted mice, we demonstrate that this bacteria-mediated deamidation contributes substantially to the NAD-boosting effect of oral nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside supplementation in several tissues. Collectively, our findings reveal an important role of bacteria-enabled deamidated pathway in host NAD metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Inactive ingredients and generally recognized as safe compounds are regarded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as benign for human consumption within specified dose ranges, but a growing body of research has revealed that many inactive ingredients might have unknown biological effects at these concentrations and might alter treatment outcomes. To speed up such discoveries, we apply state-of-the-art machine learning to delineate currently unknown biological effects of inactive ingredients—focusing on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7), two proteins that impact the pharmacokinetics of approximately 20% of FDA-approved drugs. Our platform identifies vitamin A palmitate and abietic acid as inhibitors of P-gp and UGT2B7, respectively; in silico, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo validations support these interactions. Our predictive framework can elucidate biological effects of commonly consumed chemical matter with implications on food- and excipient-drug interactions and functional drug formulation development.

Abstract: Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) results from a profound catecholaminergic surge during strong emotional or physical stress. SIC is characterized by acute left ventricular apex hypokinesia, in the absence of coronary arteries occlusion, and can lead to arrhythmias and acute heart failure. Although, most SIC patients recover, the process could be slow, and recurrence or death may occur. Despite that the SIC common denominator is a large catecholamine discharge, the pathophysiological mechanism is incompletely understood. It is thought that catecholamines have direct cytotoxicity on apical ventricular myocytes (VM), which have the highest β-adrenergic receptors density, and whose overstimulation might cause acute Ca2+ overload and oxidative stress, causing death in some VM and stunning others. Rodents receiving acute isoproterenol (ISO) overdose (OV) mimic SIC development, however, they have not been used to simultaneously assess Ca2+ handling and contractility status in isolated VM, which might explain ventricular hypokinesia. Therefore, treating rats with a single ISO-OV (67 mg/kg body weight), we sought out to characterize, with confocal imaging, Ca2+ and shortening dynamics in Fluo-4-loaded VM, during the early (1–5 days) and late post-acute phases (15 days). We found that ISO-OV VM showed contractile dysfunction; blunted shortening with slower force development and relaxation. These correlated with Ca2+ mishandling; blunted Ca2+ transient, with slower time to peak and SR Ca2+ recovery. SR Ca2+ content was low, nevertheless, diastolic Ca2+ sparks were more frequent, and their duration increased. Contractility and Ca2+ dysfunction aggravated or remained altered over time, explaining slow recovery. We conclude that diminished VM contractility is the main determinant of ISO-OV hypokinesia and is mostly related to Ca2+ mishandling.

Abstract: Objective
Considering the association of macrophage migration inhibitory factor with development of prostate diseases, this study aims to explore the effect and mechanism of macrophages (MAs) in inflammation and proliferation of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) cells.
Methods
Totally 85 prostate tissues (75 from BPH patients and 10 from brain death patients) were collected for determination of biomarkers of T lymphocyte (CD4 and CD8), B lymphocyte (CD20) and MAs (CD68), as well as androgen receptor (AR) and CD40/CD40L. MAs stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were cultured with BPH cells (BPH-1), followed by AR inhibitor or anti-CD40 L antibody treatment. Proliferation and cell apoptosis were observed by MTT assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometer. Expressions of apoptotic related proteins and MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot.
Results
BPH tissues had increased expressions of AR, CD40 and CD40 L, as well as elevated expressions of inflammation biomarkers (CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD68) in comparison to normal prostate tissues. MAs could increase the expressions of lymphocytes and inflammation biomarkers, in addition to promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Cell proliferation and inflammation reaction could be attenuated by anti-CD40 L antibody and AR inhibitor in a concentration dependent manner through inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2 and p38.
Conclusion
MAs regulate AR and CD40/CD40L expression to promote the inflammation and proliferation as well as inhibiting apoptosis of BPH-1 cells through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. This conclusion may provide a therapeutic strategy for BPH patients.

Abstract: Summary
Plants respond to cold stress by inducing the expression of transcription factors that regulate downstream genes to confer tolerance to freezing. We screened an Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion library and identified a cold-hypersensitive mutant, which we named stch4 (sensitive to chilling 4). STCH4/REIL2 encodes a ribosomal biogenesis factor that is upregulated upon cold stress. Overexpression of STCH4 confers chilling and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. The stch4 mutation reduces CBF protein levels and thus delayed the induction of C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) regulon genes. Ribosomal RNA processing is reduced in stch4 mutants, especially under cold stress. STCH4 associates with multiple ribosomal proteins, and these interactions are modulated by cold stress. These results suggest that the ribosome is a regulatory node for cold stress responses and that STCH4 promotes an altered ribosomal composition and functions in low temperatures to facilitate the translation of proteins important for plant growth and survival under cold stress.

Abstract: Summary
Netherton syndrome (NS) is a monogenic skin disease resulting from loss of function of lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related protease inhibitor (LEKTI-1). In this study we examine if bacteria residing on the skin are influenced by the loss of LEKTI-1 and if interaction between this human gene and resident bacteria contributes to skin disease. Shotgun sequencing of the skin microbiome demonstrates that lesional skin of NS subjects is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Isolates of either species from NS subjects are able to induce skin inflammation and barrier damage on mice. These microbes promote skin inflammation in the setting of LEKTI-1 deficiency due to excess proteolytic activity promoted by S. aureus phenol-soluble modulin α as well as increased bacterial proteases staphopain A and B from S. aureus or EcpA from S. epidermidis. These findings demonstrate the critical need for maintaining homeostasis of host and microbial proteases to prevent a human skin disease.

Abstract: Summary
Upon fertilization, the ovary increases in size and undergoes a complex developmental process to become a fruit. We show that cytokinins (CKs), which are required to determine ovary size before fertilization, have to be degraded to facilitate fruit growth. The expression of CKX7, which encodes a cytosolic CK-degrading enzyme, is directly positively regulated post-fertilization by the MADS-box transcription factor STK. Similar to stk, two ckx7 mutants possess shorter fruits than wild type. Quantification of CKs reveals that stk and ckx7 mutants have high CK levels, which negatively control cell expansion during fruit development, compromising fruit growth. Overexpression of CKX7 partially complements the stk fruit phenotype, confirming a role for CK degradation in fruit development. Finally, we show that STK is required for the expression of FUL, which is essential for valve elongation. Overall, we provide insights into the link between CKs and molecular pathways that control fruit growth.

Abstract: Summary
The C-terminal variants G1 and G2 of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) confer human resistance to the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma rhodesiense, but they also increase the risk of kidney disease. APOL1 and APOL3 are death-promoting proteins that are partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. We report that in podocytes, either APOL1 C-terminal helix truncation (APOL1Δ) or APOL3 deletion (APOL3KO) induces similar actomyosin reorganization linked to the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] synthesis by the Golgi PI(4)-kinase IIIB (PI4KB). Both APOL1 and APOL3 can form K+ channels, but only APOL3 exhibits Ca2+-dependent binding of high affinity to neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), promoting NCS-1-PI4KB interaction and stimulating PI4KB activity. Alteration of the APOL1 C-terminal helix triggers APOL1 unfolding and increased binding to APOL3, affecting APOL3-NCS-1 interaction. Since the podocytes of G1 and G2 patients exhibit an APOL1Δ or APOL3KO-like phenotype, APOL1 C-terminal variants may induce kidney disease by preventing APOL3 from activating PI4KB, with consecutive actomyosin reorganization of podocytes.

Abstract: Summary
High-sugar diets cause thirst, obesity, and metabolic dysregulation, leading to diseases including type 2 diabetes and shortened lifespan. However, the impact of obesity and water imbalance on health and survival is complex and difficult to disentangle. Here, we show that high sugar induces dehydration in adult Drosophila, and water supplementation fully rescues their lifespan. Conversely, the metabolic defects are water-independent, showing uncoupling between sugar-induced obesity and insulin resistance with reduced survival in vivo. High-sugar diets promote accumulation of uric acid, an end-product of purine catabolism, and the formation of renal stones, a process aggravated by dehydration and physiological acidification. Importantly, regulating uric acid production impacts on lifespan in a water-dependent manner. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis in a human cohort reveals that dietary sugar intake strongly predicts circulating purine levels. Our model explains the pathophysiology of high-sugar diets independently of obesity and insulin resistance and highlights purine metabolism as a pro-longevity target.

Abstract: Mammalian patatin-like phospholipase domain containing proteins (PNPLAs) play critical roles in triglyceride hydrolysis, phospholipids metabolism, and lipid droplet (LD) homeostasis. PNPLA7 is a lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolase anchored on the endoplasmic reticulum which associates with LDs through its catalytic region (PNPLA7-C) in response to increased cyclic nucleotide levels. However, the interaction of PNPLA7 with LDs through its catalytic region is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that PNPLA7-C localizes to the mature LDs ex vivo and also colocalizes with pre-existing LDs. Localization of PNPLA7-C with LDs induces LDs clustering via non-enzymatic intermolecular associations, while PNPLA7 alone does not induce LD clustering. Residues 742-1016 contains four putative transmembrane domains which act as a LD targeting motif and are required for the localization of PNPLA7-C to LDs. Furthermore, the N-terminal flanking region of the LD targeting motif, residues 681-741, contributes to the LD targeting, whereas the C-terminal flanking region (1169-1326) has an anti-LD targeting effect. Interestingly, the LD targeting motif does not exhibit lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolase activity even though it associates with LDs phospholipid membranes. These findings characterize the specific functional domains of PNPLA7 mediating subcellular positioning and interactions with LDs, as wells as providing critical insights into the structure of this evolutionarily conserved phospholipid-metabolizing enzyme family.

Abstract: Summary
Сhromatin is critical for genome compaction and gene expression. On a coarse scale, the genome is divided into euchromatin, which harbors the majority of genes and is enriched in active chromatin marks, and heterochromatin, which is gene-poor but repeat-rich. The conserved molecular hallmark of heterochromatin is the H3K9me3 modification, which is associated with gene silencing. We found that in Drosophila, deposition of most of the H3K9me3 mark depends on SUMO and the SUMO ligase Su(var)2-10, which recruits the histone methyltransferase complex SetDB1/Wde. In addition to repressing repeats, H3K9me3 influences expression of both hetero- and euchromatic host genes. High H3K9me3 levels in heterochromatin are required to suppress spurious transcription and ensure proper gene expression. In euchromatin, a set of conserved genes is repressed by Su(var)2-10/SetDB1-induced H3K9 trimethylation, ensuring tissue-specific gene expression. Several components of heterochromatin are themselves repressed by this pathway, providing a negative feedback mechanism to ensure chromatin homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Medial entorhinal cortex contains neural substrates for representing space. These substrates include grid cells that fire in repeating locations and increase in scale progressively along the dorsal-to-ventral entorhinal axis, with the physical distance between grid firing nodes increasing from tens of centimeters to several meters in rodents. Whether the temporal scale of grid cell spiking dynamics shows a similar dorsal-to-ventral organization remains unknown. Here, we report the presence of a dorsal-to-ventral gradient in the temporal spiking dynamics of grid cells in behaving mice. This gradient in bursting supports the emergence of a dorsal grid cell population with a high signal-to-noise ratio. In vitro recordings combined with a computational model point to a role for gradients in non-inactivating sodium conductances in supporting the bursting gradient in vivo. Taken together, these results reveal a complementary organization in the temporal and intrinsic properties of entorhinal cells.

Abstract: Summary
For all but a few mRNAs, the dynamics of metabolism are unknown. Here, we developed an experimental and analytical framework for examining these dynamics for mRNAs from thousands of genes. mRNAs of mouse fibroblasts exit the nucleus with diverse intragenic and intergenic poly(A)-tail lengths. Once in the cytoplasm, they have a broad (1000-fold) range of deadenylation rate constants, which correspond to cytoplasmic lifetimes. Indeed, with few exceptions, degradation appears to occur primarily through deadenylation-linked mechanisms, with little contribution from either endonucleolytic cleavage or deadenylation-independent decapping. Most mRNA molecules degrade only after their tail lengths fall below 25 nt. Decay rate constants of short-tailed mRNAs vary broadly (1000-fold) and are larger for short-tailed mRNAs that have previously undergone more rapid deadenylation. This coupling helps clear rapidly deadenylated mRNAs, enabling the large range in deadenylation rate constants to impart a similarly large range in stabilities.

Abstract: Summary
The TIGAR protein has antioxidant activity that supports intestinal tissue repair and adenoma development. Using a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) model, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation by TIGAR supports premalignant tumor initiation while restricting metastasis. Increased ROS in PDAC cells drives a phenotypic switch that increases migration, invasion, and metastatic capacity. This switch is dependent on increased activation of MAPK signaling and can be reverted by antioxidant treatment. In mouse and human, TIGAR expression is modulated during PDAC development, with higher TIGAR levels in premalignant lesions and lower TIGAR levels in metastasizing tumors. Our study indicates that temporal, dynamic control of ROS underpins full malignant progression and helps to rationalize conflicting reports of pro- and anti-tumor effects of antioxidant treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Diverse accessory subunits are involved in the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to CpG island (CGI) chromatin. Here we report the crystal structure of a SUZ12-RBBP4 complex bound to fragments of the accessory subunits PHF19 and JARID2. Unexpectedly, this complex adopts a dimeric structural architecture, accounting for PRC2 self-association that has long been implicated. The intrinsic PRC2 dimer is formed via domain swapping involving RBBP4 and the unique C2 domain of SUZ12. MTF2 and PHF19 associate with PRC2 at around the dimer interface and stabilize the dimer. Conversely, AEBP2 binding results in a drastic movement of the C2 domain, disrupting the intrinsic PRC2 dimer. PRC2 dimerization enhances CGI DNA binding by PCLs in pairs in vitro, reminiscent of the widespread phenomenon of transcription factor dimerization in active transcription. Loss of PRC2 dimerization impairs histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on chromatin at developmental gene loci in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Natural evolution encodes rich information about the structure and function of biomolecules in the genetic record. Previously, statistical analysis of co-variation patterns in natural protein families has enabled the accurate computation of 3D structures. Here, we explored generating similar information by experimental evolution, starting from a single gene and performing multiple cycles of in vitro mutagenesis and functional selection in Escherichia coli. We evolved two antibiotic resistance proteins, β-lactamase PSE1 and acetyltransferase AAC6, and obtained hundreds of thousands of diverse functional sequences. Using evolutionary coupling analysis, we inferred residue interaction constraints that were in agreement with contacts in known 3D structures, confirming genetic encoding of structural constraints in the selected sequences. Computational protein folding with interaction constraints then yielded 3D structures with the same fold as natural relatives. This work lays the foundation for a new experimental method (3Dseq) for protein structure determination, combining evolution experiments with inference of residue interactions from sequence information. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Summary
The mouse embryo undergoes compaction at the 8-cell stage, and its transition to 16 cells generates polarity such that the outer apical cells are trophectoderm (TE) precursors and the inner cell mass (ICM) gives rise to the embryo. Here, we report that this first cell fate specification event is controlled by glucose. Glucose does not fuel mitochondrial ATP generation, and glycolysis is dispensable for blastocyst formation. Furthermore, glucose does not help synthesize amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleobases. Instead, glucose metabolized by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) allows nuclear localization of YAP1. In addition, glucose-dependent nucleotide synthesis by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), along with sphingolipid (S1P) signaling, activates mTOR and allows translation of Tfap2c. YAP1, TEAD4, and TFAP2C interact to form a complex that controls TE-specific gene transcription. Glucose signaling has no role in ICM specification, and this process of developmental metabolism specifically controls TE cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the stability and, hence, expression of coding and noncoding RNAs. Sequence-specific features within the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) often direct mRNAs for decay. Here, we characterize a genome-wide RNA decay pathway that reduces the half-lives of mRNAs based on overall 3′ UTR structure formed by base pairing. The decay pathway is independent of specific single-stranded sequences, as regulation is maintained in both the original and reverse complement orientation. Regulation can be compromised by reducing the overall structure by fusing the 3′ UTR with an unstructured sequence. Mutating base-paired RNA regions can also compromise this structure-mediated regulation, which can be restored by re-introducing base-paired structures of different sequences. The decay pathway requires the RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1. Depletion of either protein increased steady-state levels of mRNAs with highly structured 3′ UTRs as well as highly structured circular RNAs. This structure-dependent mechanism therefore enables cells to selectively regulate coding and noncoding RNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Control of established chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection requires the production of neutralizing antibodies, but it remains unknown how the ensemble of antibodies evolves during ongoing infection. Here, we analyze the evolution of antibody responses during acute or chronic LCMV infection, combining quantitative functional assays and time-resolved antibody repertoire sequencing. We establish that antibody responses initially converge in both infection types on a functional and repertoire level, but diverge later during chronic infection, showing increased clonal diversity, the appearance of mouse-specific persistent clones, and distinct phylogenetic signatures. Chronic infection is characterized by a longer-lasting germinal center reaction and a continuous differentiation of plasma cells, resulting in the emergence of higher-affinity plasma cells exhibiting increased antibody secretion rates. Taken together, our findings reveal the emergence of a personalized antibody response in chronic infection and support the concept that maintaining B cell diversity throughout chronic LCMV infection correlates with the development of infection-resolving antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Recent discoveries have implicated the gut microbiome in the progression and severity of Parkinson’s disease; however, how gut bacteria affect such neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits α-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B. subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect. Our findings provide a basis for exploring the disease-modifying potential of B. subtilis as a dietary supplement.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria adapt to dynamic changes in the host during chronic and recurrent infections. Bacterial microevolution is one type of adaptation that imparts a selective advantage. We hypothesize that recurrent episodes of disease promote microevolution through genetic mutations that modulate disease severity. We use a pre-clinical model of otitis media (OM) to determine the potential role for microevolution of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) during sequential episodes of disease. Whole genome sequencing reveals microevolution of hemoglobin binding and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis genes, suggesting that adaptation of these systems is critical for infection. These OM-adapted strains promote increased biofilm formation, inflammation, stromal fibrosis, and an increased propensity to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Remarkably, IBCs remain for at least one month following clinical resolution of infection, suggesting an intracellular reservoir as a nidus for recurrent OM. Additional approaches for therapeutic design tailored to combat this burdensome disease will arise from these studies.

Abstract: Summary
The physiological effects of the many germline mutations of TP53, encoding the tumor suppressor protein p53, are poorly understood. Here we report generating a p53 R178C knockin mouse modeling the human TP53 R181C mutation, which is notable for its prevalence and prior molecular characterization. Consistent with its weak cancer penetrance in humans, homozygous p53178C/C mice show a modest increase in tumorigenesis but, surprisingly, are lean with decreased body fat content. They display evidence of increased lipolysis and upregulation of fatty acid metabolism in their inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). Gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses show that the mutant p53 bound and transactivated Beta-3-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRB3), a gene that is known to promote lipolysis and is associated with obesity. This study reveals that a germline mutation of p53 can affect fat metabolism, which has been implicated in cancer development.

Abstract: The developmental changes of Sertoli cells were examined and described in the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis using light and transmission electron microscopy. Sertoli cells, which are located on the basal lamina of acini in the testis, include a large number of glycogen granules, electron-dense globules, lipid droplets, and sperm morulae. Electron-dense globules are the vacuoles into which the electron-dense material is condensed. In aging Sertoli cells, the content of the globules leaks out to the extracellular area. Large lipid droplets are formed by the deposition of smaller lipid droplets into a vacuole. After the disruption of the Sertoli cell, the lipid droplets are discharged to the extracellular area and fuse with to form a larger mass. The spermatogonia which were engulfed by the Sertoli cells begin to condense their chromatin and transform themselves into sperm morulae. The constituent cells of the sperm morulae proliferate and finally differentiate into the spermatozoa. After the disruption of the Sertoli cell, the spermatozoa produced from the sperm morulae are released into the acinus lumen. Numerous matured spermatozoa in the acini gather around the large lipid droplet, to form the sperm sphere. The completed sperm spheres are subsequently released through the exhalant siphon into the stream.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations affecting exon 9 of the CALR gene lead to the generation of a C-terminally modified calreticulin (CALR) protein that lacks the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal and consequently mislocalizes outside of the ER where it activates the thrombopoietin receptor in a cell-autonomous fashion, thus driving myeloproliferative diseases. Here, we used the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) assay to monitor the trafficking of CALR. We found that exon-9-mutated CALR was released from cells in response to the biotin-mediated detachment from its ER-localized hook, in vitro and in vivo. Cellular CALR release was confirmed in suitable mouse models bearing exon-9-mutated hematopoietic systems or tumors. Extracellular CALR mediated immunomodulatory effects and inhibited the phagocytosis of dying cancer cells by dendritic cells (DC), thereby suppressing antineoplastic immune responses elicited by chemotherapeutic agents or by PD-1 blockade. Altogether, our results demonstrate paracrine immunosuppressive effects for exon-9-mutated CALR.
