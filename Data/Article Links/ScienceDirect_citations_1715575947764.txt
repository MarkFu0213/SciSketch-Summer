Abstract: Background
Stroke is a serious complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA). The transcranial Doppler (TCD) is the risk-screening tool for ischemic strokes. The objective of the study was to describe the clinical progression of children with SCA who presented with high risk for stroke by TCD or relevant changes by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and underwent the regular transfusion program (RTP) and/or hydroxyurea (HU) treatment between 2007 and 2018.
Method
This was a neonatal retrospective/prospective cohort study with children born between 1999 and 2014 with the homozygotic form (HbSS) or Sβ0-thalassemia who underwent TCD at least once.
Results
Of the 718 children screened during this period, 675 had HbSS and 43 Sβ0-thalassemia. In 54 children (7.5%), all with HbSS, a high-risk TCD (n = 45) or, when the TCD was inconclusive, an MRA with cerebral vasculopathy (n = 9) was used for detection. Of these, 51 started the RTP and the families of three refused treatment. Of the 43 children with a high-risk TCD who initiated the RTP, 29 (67.4%) reverted to low risk. In 18 of them (62%), HU was started at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) before transfusion discontinuation. None of these 29 patients had a stroke. Eight children (18.6%) maintained a high-risk TCD, even using the RTP/HU and two had a stroke.
Conclusions
The TCD was confirmed as a viable tool for tracking patients with a risk for stroke. The RTP was effective in preventing the primary event. New strategies are necessary to prevent stroke using HU and new drugs, in addition to bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract: Introduction
In Brazil, the sickle cell trait (SCT) has an average prevalence of 4% in the general population and 6–10% among Afro-descendants. Although SCT is highly prevalent, a large segment of the population ignores their status. The Therapeutic Guidelines prohibit the transfusion of SCT red blood cells into patients with hemoglobin disorders or severe acidosis and newborns.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study with data from 37,310 blood donation candidates. The study included only eligible first-time donors qualified to be tested for the presence of hemoglobin S (HbS) at the Fundação Hemominas Juiz de Fora, Brazil. The variables studied were gender, skin color, age, type of donation, place of birth, blood type, result of the solubility test for hemoglobin S (HbST) and hemoglobin electrophoresis (HbEF). Statistical analysis was performed using the Q square test and the Kappa index of agreement for comparing biochemical methods. This project was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee.
Results
The analysis of first-time donor data showed that 7166 were considered eligible. A total of 127 of the 7166 donors were carriers of SCT (1.77%). Among the blood donors, 73.23% were from the local area. The HbST and HbEF were found to be 100% in concordance. Sensitivity was not tested in the present study.
Conclusions
The HbST is highly specific for identifying the HbS, but sensitivity was not tested in this study. The screening of blood donors for abnormal hemoglobins is useful, helping to detect and counsel heterozygous people. The study seeks to identify the prevalence of SCT in a region of Brazil.

Abstract: Introduction
Studies have shown that the loss of the FOXO3 transcriptional function is involved in the pathophysiology of some chronic erythroid disorders, including beta-thalassemia (β-thal). Therefore, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3800231 (35-2764A > G) could contribute to alterations in its transcriptional activity, acting as a modifier of β-thal phenotypic manifestations.
Objective and method
In order to better understand the genotypic and/or allelic distributions among β-thal patients, we evaluated 83 β-thal heterozygous and 20 homozygous, compared to 117 individuals without hemoglobinopathies (control group). Additionally, we verified any influence of the FOXO3 polymorphism on clinical manifestations among β-thal homozygotes.
Results
We obtained higher frequencies of the wild-type homozygous (AA) and the wild-type allele (A) in the β-thal group (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.00014, respectively). The most common clinical manifestations found among β-thal homozygotes were iron overload (90%), splenomegaly (65%) and bone complications (35%), e.g., osteopenia/osteoporosis. We observed that close to 80% of the patients presenting such manifestations had the genotype AA. However, we did not find any significant involvement of the FOXO3 polymorphism in clinical manifestation occurrences.
Conclusion
Thus, we concluded that the SNP rs3800231 did not play a significant role as a modifier of the clinical manifestations observed in the β-thal homozygotes studied.

Abstract: Shape stability and excellent photothermal conversion performance are critical for composite PCMs in the field of solar energy utilization. This study prepares a nickel and cobalt-based bimetal organic framework (Ni–Co-BTC) which is further employed as the supporting material for 1-octadecanol (OD). The flower-like Ni–Co-BTC with an interconnected network exhibits large specific surface area, pore volume, and appropriate pore size distribution, which is conducive to the encapsulation of OD (up to 70 wt%). In addition, TiN nanoparticles are added to enhance the photothermal conversion performance of composite PCM. Therefore, the obtained OD/Ni–Co-BTC/TiN composite PCM exhibits considerable thermal energy storage capacity (145.8 J/g) and remarkable photothermal energy conversion efficiency (up to 97.75%). Furthermore, the composite PCM has outstanding thermal stability and reliability, and the phase change enthalpy is reduced by only 1.7% after 100 cycles. Accordingly, the composite PCM shows a promising application potential in solar energy harvesting, conversion and storage.

Schizosaccharomyces pombe MAP kinase Sty1 promotes survival of Δppr10 cells with defective mitochondrial protein synthesis,

Abstract: Deletion of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe pentatricopeptide repeat gene ppr10 severely impairs mitochondrial translation, resulting in defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). ppr10 deletion also induces iron starvation response, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reduced viability under fermentative conditions. S. pombe has two principal stress-response pathways, which are mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase Sty1 and the basic leucine zipper transcription factor Pap1, respectively. In this study, we examined the roles of Sty1 and Pap1 in the cellular response to the mitochondrial translation defect caused by ppr10 deletion. We found that ppr10 deletion resulted in two waves of stress protein activation. The early response occurred in exponential phase and resulted in the expression of a subset of stress proteins including Gst2 and Obr1. The upregulation of some of these stress proteins in Δppr10 cells in early response is dependent on the basal nuclear levels of Sty1 or Pap1. The late response occurred in early stationary phase and coincided with the stable localization of Sty1 and Pap1 in the nucleus, presumably resulting in persistent activation of a large set of stress proteins. Deletion of sty1 in Δppr10 cells caused severe defects in cell division and growth, and further impaired cell viability. Deletion of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase gene sod2 whose expression is controlled by Sty1 severely inhibited the growth of Δppr10 cells. Overexpression of sod2 improves the viability of Δppr10 cells. Our results support an important role for Sty1 in counteracting stress induced by ppr10 deletion under fermentative growth conditions.

Abstract: Introduction
One of the most critical complications in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is the progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The dynamics of clonal evolution in MDS and how acquired mutations can be used as biomarkers to track disease progression remains under investigation.
Objective and method
Herein, we investigated the frequency of common myeloid clonal mutations (FLT3, NPM1, JAK2, IDH1 and IDH2) in 88 patients with MDS and 35 AML patients with myelodysplasia-related changes, followed at a single reference center in northeastern Brazil.
Results
Overall, 9/88 (10%) of the MDS patients and 9/35 (26%) of the secondary AML patients had at least one mutation. While the JAK2 V617F mutation was the most frequent in the MDS patients, the FLT3, NPM1, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were more frequently found in the secondary AML group. Furthermore, there was a higher frequency of FLT3, NPM1, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in MDS patients classified as high-risk subtypes than in those of lower risk.
Conclusion
Despite the limited sample size, our data suggest that mutations in FLT3, NPM1, IDH1 and IDH2 genes could be potential biomarkers to detect early disease progression in MDS.

Abstract: Background
m6A-RNA modification mediated by the N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation-related molecule methyltransferase-like 3 has been implicated in the progression of endometriosis. However, the functions of other m6A regulators, especially in ovarian endometriosis, remain unknown.
Methods
Three datasets (GSE7305, GSE7307, and GSE37837) with diagnosed ovarian endometriosis were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using bioinformatics methods such as Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, Gene Ontology analysis, protein–protein interaction, and correlation, hub genes were identified. Using dot blot and N6-methyladenosine-IP-qPCR, the total and individual N6-methyladenosine gene levels were quantified. On clinical ovarian ectopic and eutopic endometrium tissues, N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation sequencing was performed. To authenticate protein localization and expression level, immunohistochemical staining and western blot were conducted, respectively. The database Connectivity Map was used to predict small molecules with potential therapeutic effects.
Results
In ovarian endometriosis, the N6-methyladenosine "reader" molecule IGF2BP2 and related target genes MEIS2 and GATA6 were highly expressed. IGF2BP2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ectopic endometrial stromal cells by stabilizing the mRNA of MEIS2 and GATA6. Synergistically, METTL3 and IGF2BP2 increased the N6-methyladenosine methylation of MEIS2 and GATA6. We developed five molecules (Mercaptopurine, MK-886, CP-863187, Canadine, and Securinine) that could be used to treat ovarian endometriosis based on IGF2BP2.
Conclusion
Our findings provided additional support for a systematized understanding of the role of N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation in endometriosis and confirmed for the first time the mechanism of IGF2BP2 in promoting ovarian endometriosis. This provides the molecular foundation for potential future therapies for ovarian endometriosis.

Abstract: Introduction
The aim of this study was to describe maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with sickle cell disease (SCD) followed at Santa Casa de Sao Paulo over a 10-year period (between 2010 and 2019).
Method
Fifty-five records of pregnancies were analyzed among 35 women with SCD.
Results
Among 29 newborns, 19 (65.5%) were full-term and 10 pre-term; 24 (82.7%) caesareans and 5 (17.2%) natural births were observed. The mean gestational age at birth and mother`s age were 36.6 weeks (30–40) and 26.7 years (17–39), respectively. No maternal death was observed. The main maternal obstetric and non-obstetric complications were: pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and vaso-occlusive crisis, urinary tract infection and acute chest syndrome, respectively. Twenty-six (47.0%) fetal deaths were observed, 24 being intrauterine fetal (14 early abortions, 10 late abortions and 2 stillbirths). Regarding the red blood cell transfusion history, 40 (72.7%) out of 55 pregnancies received transfusion. Pregnant women who received 6 or more transfusions throughout pregnancy had a significantly lower number of abortions, i.e., no cases of early abortion and only 1 case of late abortion, versus 14 and 9 cases in pregnancies with 0–5 transfusions, respectively. Despite advances in the management of SCD, pregnant women with SCD (particularly those with HbSS) are at a high risk for maternal and fetal complications, even though they are followed in reference centers.
Conclusion
The lower risk of intrauterine fetal death for those women who received more transfusions throughout pregnancy observed in the current study leads us once more to raise the need for prospective, multicenter, randomized trials to determine whether the potential benefits balance the risks of prophylactic transfusions.

Abstract: Introduction
The isolation of captured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from leukoreduction filters (LRFs) can be of great importance in terms of bringing the lost cells back into use.
Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate various methods based on their potential to recover the peripheral blood cells from LRFs with a focus on mononuclear cells (MNCs).
Method
For cell isolation from LRFs, three distinct methods (back-flushing, direct and vacuum pump) were compared through the calculation of the yield of isolated MNCs. The viability of extracted cells was determined by the flow cytometry technique. Moreover, the recovered MNCs were characterized regarding the presence of blood stem cell purification. The cell culture, microscopic observation, and immunophenotyping were employed to characterize the blood stem cells (hematopoietic, mesenchymal and progenitor endothelial stem cells).
Results
The yield of isolation obtained in the back-flushing, direct and vacuum pump methods were 17.7 ± 1.28, 17.3 ± 0.96 and 21.2 ± 0.90 percent, respectively. Although the highest potential for total blood cell recovery belonged to the vacuum pump method, the lowest cell viability (85.73 ± 4.84%) was observed in this method. However, the isolation process of the back-flushing and direct methods had less effect on cell viability. The characterization of the isolated MNCs displayed that the dominant positive phenotype was for CD34/CD45, indicating hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, the endothelial stem/progenitor cells were significantly detected as CD31/CD133 positive cells.
Conclusion
According to our results and considering the safety and efficiency potential of each of the applied methods, the back-flushing in comparison with the other methods can be considered a suitable procedure for MNC isolation from LRFs.

Abstract: Although the ohmic-contact and electrostatic field can be regulated by the intermediate layer for efficient carrier extraction, challenges remain in high-quality back contact as well as improved quality of crystallized CZTSSe absorber layer simultaneously. Here, we introduce a controllable CdS nanolayer prepared by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) process between the CZTS precursors and Mo back contact. The results disclose that the surface chemistry of the naked Mo film can be modified by the formed CdS nanolayer and thus MoS2 complex during the chemical bath process. However, such CdS nanolayer and MoS2 complex can be readily consumed during the following selenization process, without deteriorating the ohmic-back contact. Simultaneously, the as-grown CZTSSe absorber is not only with high crystallinity and less composition fluctuations, but also doped by Cd2+. Subsequently the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells is increased by 26% as CdS nanolayer is introduced. This work provides a cost-effective and universal approach to design and modify the interface or surface of photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical devices.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations combined with experimental methods were used to summarize the changes of thermophysical parameters such as bulk thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity at constant pressure and melting point, which based on the radial distribution function and interaction energy. The micro-mechanisms of the melting and heat transport properties of solar salts at the nanoscale were analyzed. The simulation and experimental results show that the bulk thermal expansion coefficient of solar salt decreases with the increase of the mesopore size. At the same scale, the bulk thermal expansion coefficient of the nanopillar solar salt is smaller than that of the spherical structure solar salt in the nanopore. The raising of the scale enhances the thermal conductivity of the solar salt, but has little effect on the specific heat capacity. The thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the CPCM are improved with the increase of Al2O3 in the skeleton. The variation of the skeleton structure has a certain influence on the specific heat capacity of CPCM. The melting point of solar salt shows a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the raising of nanopore size. The change of the mesoporous structure affects the melting point of CPCM. The addition of the porous alumino silicate ceramic skeleton reduces the melting point of the solar salt. And the melting point of the CPCM with larger interfacial binding energy is relatively higher.

Abstract: The measurement of the current-voltage (IV) characteristics is the most important step for quality control and optimization of the fabrication process in research and industrial production of silicon solar cells. The occurrence of transient errors and hysteresis effects in IV-measurements can hamper the direct analysis of the IV-data of high-capacitance silicon solar cells. We propose a novel procedure to reconstruct a quasi-steady-state (qss) IV-characteristics from hysteretic measurements by aligning the generalized current density of forward and backward sweeps. In the process, the base doping concentration NB and the cell thickness d are used as optimization parameters and calculated alongside the qss-IV-curve. We summarize the theory behind the method, describe the experimental implementation and verify the applicability of the approach by comparing the extracted doping concentration to multiple alternative methods. For a test set of more than 100 silicon heterojunction solar cells with doping concentrations between 3 and 7∙1015 cm-3 a RMSD <3.4∙1014 cm-3 is achieved. Basic parameter extraction from the qss-IV-curve closely match reference values with a RMSD <0.1 %abs in efficiency and fill factor.

Abstract: Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are widely considered to be one the most promising material in photovoltaic technology, the use of this semiconductor as absorbent layer in solar cells has attracted considerable interest due to their excellent properties. It has been reported that the incorporation of potassium ion is a powerful strategy to tune the perovskites properties, notwithstanding there has been some disagreement regarding the role of this monovalent alkali metal within the perovskite structure. Here, we investigated the impact of K+ on the film properties and photovoltaic performance in double cation perovskite solar cells Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3. Our results show that K+ intervenes in the crystallization process inducing the extraction of non-reactive PbI2 from the bulk, resulting in a notable enhancement in morphology and reduced non-radiative recombination. The solar cells fabricated with 3% of K+ content achieve a PCE of 19.3%, showing a significative improvement in Jsc, Voc and stability values compared with control devices.

Abstract: Understanding the exquisitely complex nature of the three-dimensional organization of the genome and how it affects gene regulation remains a central question in biology. Recent advances in sequencing- and imaging-based approaches in decoding the three-dimensional chromatin landscape have enabled a systematic characterization of gene regulatory architecture. In this review, we outline how chromatin architecture provides a reference atlas to predict the functional consequences of non-coding variants associated with human traits and disease. High-throughput perturbation assays such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR-based genome engineering in combination with a reference atlas opened an avenue for going beyond observational studies to experimentally validating the regulatory principles of the genome. We conclude by providing a suggested path forward by calling attention to barriers that can be addressed for a more complete understanding of the regulatory landscape of the human brain.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common complication of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT), characterized by irritative symptoms of the urinary tract and a higher morbidity and mortality rate. The worldwide incidence is reported between 10% and 70%. The use of alkylating agents and BK viral infection are the most frequent etiologies. The aim of this study was to report the HC incidence in an outpatient haplo-HCST program with a reduced intensity-conditioning (RIC) regimen, cataloguing risk factors, complications and final outcomes.
Methods
The medical database of patients who received a haplo-HSCT between January 2012 and November 2017 was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic variables, general characteristics and HC incidence were included.
Results
One hundred and eleven patients were included, 30 (27%) of whom developed HC, most of them (70%) being grade II, with a 30-day (7–149) median time of post-transplant HC onset. The BK virus was detected in 71% of the urine samples analyzed. All HC patients responded to treatment, except two (6.6%), who died due to HC complications.
Conclusions
There was no difference in the HC incidence or severity, compared to that reported when performing haplo-HSCT in hospitalized patients, although the donor-recipient sex mismatch did relate to a higher HC incidence.

Abstract: Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly divide and fuse to maintain their proper structure and function. Cancer cells are often accompanied by an imbalance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, cancer progression is greatly affected by this imbalance. Here, we found that high-metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells possess higher caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression compared with low-metastatic breast cancer MCF-7 cells or normal breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. Downregulation of Cav-1 decreases the migratory and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results further demonstrated that downregulation of Cav-1 facilitated DRP1 and MFN2 to translocate to mitochondria, increasing the inhibitory phosphorylation level of DRP1 at Ser637 by protein kinase A (PKA), resulting in mitochondria elongation. We also showed that downregulation of Cav-1 significantly reduced the Rac1 activity by affecting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which then inhibited F-actin formation. Based on these findings, we proposed that Cav-1 mediated mitochondrial fission-affected intracellular ROS generation and activated Rho GTPases, leading to F-actin-dependent formation of lamellipodia and promotion of breast cancer motility.

Abstract: Introduction
By providing timely actionable results for prompt management, point-of-care testing (POCT) kits have revolutionised medical care for various diseases, ranging from infectious diseases like malaria to genetic disorders, such as sickle cell disease (SCD). They are, however, underutilised in the diagnosis of SCD in developing countries, where the need is greatest.
Objective
The study was aimed at assessing the sensitivity of HemoTypeSC POCT among a cohort of children with SCD, previously diagnosed by Alkaline cellulose acetate hemoglobin electrophoresis (ACAE), with or without high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Methods
In this descriptive cross-sectional study, HemoTypeSC test was conducted on all participants and its sensitivity was determined by comparing results with those obtained using ACAE. Discordance was verified with HPLC.
Results
One hundred and forty-five children aged one to 19 years were studied. There were 84 males and 61 females (male: female ratio = 1.4: 1). The HemoTypeSC was able to correctly diagnose sickle cell anemia (SCA) and hemoglobin SC in all (100%) of the children tested.
Conclusion
The HemoTypeSC shows high sensitivity in detecting SCA and hemoglobin SC. Hence, it is useful for targeted screening of individuals suspected of having SCD, leading to rapid diagnosis of these hemoglobinopathies, even in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: A simple low-temperature hydrothermal route was adopted to prepare the binary ZnO/g-C3N4 heterostructures, which were thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic probes. The clearly visible interfaces between the ZnO NRs and g-C3N4 in the HRTEM micrograph verify the formation of ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction structures, which, combined with N3 dye, deliver increased optical absorption extending from UV to the visible range. The binary ZnO/g-C3N4 heterostructures are used as the photoanode in the DSSC application. Improvement in the DSSC performance arises because of the growth of the g-C3N4 layer on the ZnO nanorods surface, which efficiently delays the reverse recombination of electrons from ZnO to the electrolyte. The g-C3N4 layer also increases the electron concentration in the photoelectrode and, thereby, directly contributes to the improved performance of the DSSC device. The optimal DSSC based on the ZnO/g-C3N4 photoanode delivers its characteristic JSC ∼14.18 mA/cm2, VOC ∼544 mV, FF ∼0.586 and η ∼4.52%, which is about 2.3 times greater than the DSSC efficiency based on pure ZnO nanorod photoelectrode and retains the spirit of generating the green energy following the photovoltaic endeavor.

Abstract: Introduction
Platelet antibody identification is indispensable for diagnosing the human platelet antigen (HPA) or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) immunization, mostly because it can restrict the compatibility and results of transfusions. Correct detection of these antibodies is of utmost importance for the diagnosis and treatment.
Method
We present 16 platelet alloimmunization results, comparing two tests with different technologies: the MAIPA (monoclonal antibody immobilization of platelet antigens), as a reference technique, and a bead-based assay, the Pak-Lx.
Results
Eleven samples (68.75%) showed agreement in both techniques. Two tests were false negatives in the Pak-Lx: a pan-reactivity in GPIIbIIIa and an anti-HPA-9b. On the other hand, the Pak-Lx was more sensitive to detect a decreasing anti-HPA-5b. The Pak-Lx found an anti-HPA-2b positive, but with a low median fluorescent intensity (MFI), suggesting a false-positive result. Moreover, in one case, the MAIPA was negative for a positive Pak-Lx HLA.
Conclusion
Antibody platelet diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The methods seemed similar, the Pak-Lx being faster and simpler than the MAIPA, and they can be complementary to solve clinical issues.

Abstract: Introduction
Knowing the information regarding the panorama of lymphoma diagnosis in patients treated in the Brazilian Public Unified Health System from the last 10 years is a challenge for Strategic Health Planning.
Objective
To characterize the Brazilian population with lymphoma treated in the Brazilian Public Unified Health System between 2008 and 2017 regarding staging, sex, residence site and mortality.
Material and methods
A descriptive, retrospective, and longitudinal trial with secondary data from DataSUS (SIA/SUS and SIM/SUS) obtained from patients with ICD-10 C81−85.
Results
There were 70,850 lymphoma cases between 2008 and 2017, of which 55% were male, the median age was 51 years, and 27% had Hodgkin Lymphoma. Most patients (56%) were treated outside the residence city. São Paulo State accounted for 25% of patients. Treatment initiation took more than 60 days in 27% of cases. A total of 45,601 deaths were due to lymphoma (12% Hodgkin Lymphoma and 88% Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), with a median age 63 years, and were mainly males (55%). Staging data were inadequate in 23% of patients, and analysis was performed only on the valid records. Advanced disease was diagnosed in 58% of patients (60% male; 57% female) and was more common in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (62%) versus Hodgkin Lymphoma (49%).
Discussion
Late diagnosis interferes with mortality rates. Health promotion and cancer prevention campaigns, especially targeting the male public, and training for early diagnosis and early treatment are needed.
Conclusion
Effective measures for early diagnosis and treatment are urgently needed for lymphoma control.

Abstract: Electrochromic energy storage devices (EESDs) integrate energy storage and electrochromism into one smart device that can realize the visualization of the energy level by the naked eyes, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. It is critical to explore suitable electrode materials for achieving both high electrochromic and electrochemical performance. Herein, we propose an aqueous aluminum-ion electrochromic energy storage device (AIEESD) by assembling the polyaniline (PANI) electrochromic cathode, Al metal frame anode and AlCl3 electrolyte, which yields an open-circuit voltage of ∼1.22 V and a fast self-bleaching behavior without any energy input. Additionally, the developed device exhibits outstanding electrochromic energy storage performances with discharging capacity of 68.1 mAh m−2, excellent rate capability, large optical modulation (ΔT = 55% at 630 nm) and high coloration efficiency (93.62 cm2 C−1 at 630 nm). Moreover, the prototype device can reversibly switch between the multicolor (transparent, light yellow, green and dark blue) when the voltage changes from 0.4 to 2.5 V, which means the energy status can be monitored by the obvious color transition. These results show that the AIEESD in this work has great application prospects for smart windows and energy storage displays.

Abstract: Introduction
There is a demand to update national mortality trends data related to sickle cell disease (SCD) in Brazil. This study describes causes of death and mortality issues related to SCD using the multiple-cause-of-death methodology.
Methods
The annual SCD mortality data was extracted from the public databases of the Mortality Information System by researching deaths in rubric D57 “sickle-cell disorders” of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and processed by the Multiple Cause Tabulator.
Results
From 2000 to 2018 in Brazil, a total of 9817 deaths related to SCD occurred during the 19-year period, as the underlying cause in 6924 (70.5%) and as the associated cause of death in 2893 (29.5%). The mean and median ages at death during the entire period were significantly lower for males, 29.4 (±19.6) and 27.5 (15.5–41.5), respectively, than for females, 33.3 (±20.3) and 31.0 (19.5–46.5), respectively. The leading SCD overall associated causes of death were septicemias (32.1%), followed by pneumonias (19.4%) and respiratory failure (18.2%). On certificates with SCD as an associated cause, the underlying causes of death were circulatory system diseases (8.7%), followed, in males, by digestive system and infectious diseases and respiratory system failures, while in females, maternal deaths, included in the chapter on pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, accounting for 4.6% of female deaths, were succeeded by digestive system and infectious diseases.
Conclusion
This study revised mortality data on death rate trends, underlying and associated causes of death, age at death and regional distribution of death in Brazil.

Abstract: The yield produced from conventional hemispherical solar still (CHSS) is limited. Modified hemispherical solar still (MHSS) using rubber and wick materials at the basin of the HSS are examined in this research paper. To experimentally studied the effect of rubber materials at different thicknesses (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm) and wick materials at a different thicknesses (1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 mm), under the same operating conditions, three equal HSS units are designed and constructed. The experiments were conducted in four days, under the climatic conditions of the city of El Oued-Algeria. The experimental results showed that a rubber material at a different thickness (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm) improves the yield by 14.29, 26.53, 35.71, and 46.94%, respectively as compared to the CHSS. Also, using wick materials at different thicknesses (1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 mm) improves the yield by 12.24, 22.45, 30.61, and 40.81%, respectively, as compared to the CHSS. This modification is very efficient and inexpensive because rubber and wick materials are available at a cheap price. After comparing the yield of HSS according to the thickness of the rubber and wick materials used, we found that the more thickness of the materials (rubber and wick), the better the yield. Therefore, we recommend using thicker materials.

Abstract: It is widely known that the challenge of making good electrical contact at the back electrode interface will always follow us for high-efficient kesterite-type CZTSSe thin-film solar cells. Aiming at clarifying the correlation of device performance on the micro-structure of back interface, we come up with a new fresh design that introducing in-situ anodized MoO3 porous arrays with regulated structural parameters acts as the back interfacial contact. Regards the such array-structures of interpenetrated CZTSSe and MoO3, the study reveals that the overall device performance is closely related to the micro-structure of the MoO3 interface layer, and the optimized device efficiency can be improved to 9.00% from 6.31% (Ref. Mo-based cells), having a 32% increased JSC together with a 64% increase in FF. The performance improvement mechanism is analyzed in details. The interesting preliminary finding would indicate that the new strategy is very effective to form reliable electrical contact at the back interface for high-efficient CZTSSe solar cells.

An intact zinc finger motif of the C1B domain is critical for stability and activity of diacylglycerol kinase-ε,

Abstract: Diacylglycerol kinase-ε (DGKε) phosphorylates DAG to phosphatidic acid with unique specificity toward 18:0/20:4 DAG (SAG). SAG is a typical backbone of phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives, therefore DGKε activity is crucial for the turnover of these signaling lipids. Malfunction of DGKε contributes to several pathophysiological conditions, including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) linked with DGKE mutations. In the present study we analyzed the role of a zinc finger motif of the C1B domain of DGKε, as some aHUS-linked mutations affect this ill-defined part of the kinase. For this, we introduce a novel fluorescent assay for determination of DGKε activity which relies on the use of NBD-SAG in mixed micelles as a substrate, followed by TLC separation of NBD-phosphatidic acid formed. The assay reliably determines the activity of purified human GST-DGKε, also endogenous DGKε or overexpressed mouse DGKε-Myc in cell lysates, homogenates, and kinase immunoprecipitates. Using the above assay we found that four amino acids, Cys135, Cys138, His161 and Cys164, forming the zinc finger motif in the C1B domain are required for the DGKε-Myc activity and stability. Substitution of any of these amino acids with Ala or Trp in DGKε-Myc abolished its activity and led to its proteasomal degradation, possibly assisted by Hsp70/90/40 chaperones. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevented the degradation but the mutated proteins were inactive. The present data on the deleterious effect of the zinc finger motif disruption contribute to the understanding of the DGKε-linked aHUS, as the Cys164Trp substitution in mouse DGKε corresponds to the Cys167Trp one in human DGKε found in some aHUS patients.

Abstract: Calcium looping (CaL) process, a thermochemical energy storage technique, probably offers a mid-term if not near-term solution to the next generation Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants featured with high temperature over 700 °C. However, CaCO3 used in the conventional CaL-CSP system is usually white with little absorption of sun light, hindering its application in efficient volumetric solar energy conversion scheme. This work decorates CaO with dark Ca2MnO4 derived from natural manganocalcite, achieving direct solar absorption and simultaneously enhanced anti-sintering ability due to the presence of dark Ca2MnO4. As a thermal stabilizer, Ca2MnO4 minimized the sintering-induced decay of the materials' energy storage density and ensured high and stable energy storage performance over prolonged operation cycles. Detailed electron microscopy-based analysis confirmed the compositional homogeneity which is identified, together with the porous structures, as the crucial feature to guarantee a stable performance. Over 20 cycles, CaO/Ca2MnO4 nanoparticles still remained energy storage density of 1932 kJ/kg, exceeding that of the limestone-derived reference material by nearly 100%. Additionally, the average solar absorptance of Ca2MnO4-stabilized calcium composite is remarkably enhanced in comparison with that of conventional limestone. This work paves the way for designing materials with high energy storage density and excellent cyclic stability for simultaneous solar thermal conversion and high-temperature thermochemical energy storage.

Abstract: Introduction
Patient blood management (PBM) programs are associated with better patient outcomes, a reduced number of transfusions and cost-savings The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are valuable tools in this process, but their availability is limited in developing countries This study assesses the feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted CDS system for low-income countries.
Methods
This was a prospective study of the PBM program implementation, in a 200-bed tertiary hospital, between February 2019 and May 2020. Outcome measures were red blood cell (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet unit transfusions, the transfusion of a single unit of red blood cells and an RBC adequacy index (RAI).
Results
Comparing the post-PBM program era with the pre-PBM system era, there was a decrease in red blood cell transfusions (p=0.05), with an increase in single unit red blood cell transfusions (p=0.005) and RAI (p<0.001).
Conclusions
The PBM programs, including electronic transfusion guidelines with pre-transfusion medical auditing, was associated with improved transfusion practices and reduced product acquisition-related costs.

Abstract: Introduction
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) plays a major role in diagnosing hematologic malignancies. In patients diagnosed with precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), expression of certain non-lineage/cross lineage antigens is of prognostic and cytogenetic relevance. There is a paucity of studies that have comprehensively analyzed the clinical and laboratory profiles of B-ALL patients showing aberrant T/natural killer (NK) cell antigen expression.
Materials and methods
This is a prospective study where 152 consecutive B-ALL patients were analyzed for aberrant expression of T/NK cell antigens (CD1a, CD5, CD4, CD7, CD8 and CD56) by FCI. The clinical and laboratory profile of these T/NK-cell antigen-expressing B-ALL patients was statistically analyzed against conventional B-ALL patients.
Results
In our B-ALL cohort, CD5, CD7 and CD56 expression were observed in one, six and nine patients, respectively. CD56-expressing B-ALL patients were predominantly children (89%) and presented as standard clinical risk (p=0.010) disease with frequent ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (p=0.021) positivity. On the contrary, CD7-expressing B-ALL patients were adolescent-young adult/adult-age skewed (83%) and had an adverse cytogenetic profile (p=0.001), especially for the frequent presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion (p=0.004) and KMT2A rearrangement (p=0.045). CD7-expressing B-ALL patients had inferior event-free survival (p=0.040) than their CD56-expressing counterparts, but there was no significant difference in the overall survival (p=0.317).
Conclusion
In comparison to conventional B-ALL patients, there are significant differences in the age, cytogenetic profile and event-free survival of T/NK-cell antigen-expressing B-ALL patients.

Abstract: Introduction
Invasive fungal diseases represent important causes of morbidity and mortality among pediatric oncohematological patients. Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a rare and aggressive disease that occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate is high and therefore, accurate and early diagnosis is essential.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis among pediatric oncohematological patients and characterize them with confirmed diagnoses.
Methods
This was a retrospective study that analyzed the medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with oncohematological diseases and suspected fungal infections, who were included after obtaining informed consent, from January to December 2017, in the pediatric unit of a tertiary university hospital. Data collected from medical record analysis included the following: underlying diagnosis, absolute neutrophil count, clinical presentation, culture and biopsy results, surgical procedures performed, survival and mortality.
Results
A total of 27 patients were evaluated, with three suspected cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Histopathological and microbiological analyses confirmed two cases. In both cases, the pathogen isolated in the culture was Fusarium sp. The two confirmed cases were female, aged 12 and 14 years, both with an absolute neutrophil count of 10cells/μL. The underlying disease of the first patient was acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5), whereas the second patient presented idiopathic bone marrow aplasia.
Conclusion
Both confirmed cases of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis presented with constitutional symptoms and signs of nasal and sinusital inflammation. This demonstrates the importance of fever as a symptom in immunocompromised patients and it should prompt otorhinolaryngological investigation.

Abstract: Kesterite-type based thin film solar cell technologies are mainly based on polycrystalline absorber layers. A promising low cost alternative technology uses Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4 (CZTSSe) monograins (single crystals of 20–100 μm size) which are fixed in a polymer matrix to form a flexible solar cell. The Cu/Zn disorder is discussed as a possible reason for band tailing causing voltage losses limiting the efficiency of CZTSSe-based devices. The experimental determination of the order parameter Q which is a quantitative measure of Cu/Zn disorder, requires a differentiation between the isoelectronic cations Cu+ and Zn2+. An in-depth analysis of neutron diffraction data allows the determination of type and concentration of intrinsic point defects including a distinction between Cu and Zn. Neutron diffraction requires large sample volumes, thus monograins offer the unique possibility to correlate structural disorder in CZTSSe with device performance parameters. In this study we tackle the influence of grinding the monograins on stoichiometry deviations, the Cu/Zn disorder as well as intrinsic point defects and optoelectronic properties of CZTSSe monograins. Moreover, an easy methodology based on Raman scattering spectroscopy is proposed for the assessment of Cu/Zn disorder in the CZTSSe compounds.

Abstract: The performance and industrial visibility of organic solar cells (OSCs) are greatly impacted by the functionality and stability of the interfacial layers. Many reported interface materials exhibited limitations in their fabrication temperature along with the operational stability toward the industrial up-scalability. In this work, a systematic analysis was conducted on the fresh and photo-aged-inverted non-fullerene organic solar cells (iNF-OSCs) with different structures of the electron transporting layers (ZnO, ZnO/PDINO, and PDINO), through studying their optical and electronic properties using external quantum efficiency measurements and impedance spectroscopy. Consequently, we presented PDINO as an efficient low temperature operation cathode interlayer for iNF-OSCs. Compared to the benchmark interface layers for i-OSCs such as ZnO, the PDINO interlayer used to replace the ZnO film, exhibiting a remarkable operational photostability. Where PDINO based iNF-OSCs demonstrated an extremely photostable behavior that is almost three times higher than the ZnO based devices under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) continuous illumination conditions. This behavior might be attributed to the PDINO interlayer properties, which undergoes with no photochemical reaction with the contacted PM6:Y7 photo-active layer, avoiding the inescapable photocatalytic effect that is commonly obtained by the ZnO interlayer.

Abstract: Objective
Describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics and the transfusion strategy of patients at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein with platelet refractoriness and identify their etiological characteristics. Standardize the platelet immunofluorescence technique by flow cytometry as a test for platelet compatibility in immune platelet refractoriness in transfusion support.
Methods
Review of medical records of refractory platelet patients followed at HIAE from January 2011 to May 2017. Clinical-demographic data, laboratory data and identification of the use of compatible genotyped platelets for patients in need of transfusion therapy were collected. The analyzed patients were classified according to the etiology of their platelet refractoriness. To standardize the FC-PIFT technique, blood group O platelets were incubated with serum from blood group AB donors and anti-IgG monoclonal antibody to determine the negative control. In order to verify the influence of the ABO system, monoclonal anti-IgG antibodies were incubated with blood group A or B platelets and with blood group O donor serum with isohemagglutinins below and above 1/64.
Results
A total of 47 patients were evaluated, a 51% (24/47) preponderance of associated immune and non-immune factors (NIPR + IPR). The most common causes of NIPR + IPR were splenomegaly (54%) and the development of HLA antibodies (88%), consistent with the literature. For patients who required therapeutic transfusion, only a small portion received compatible genotyped platelets.
Conclusion
Although 60% of patients could benefit from the therapeutic transfusion of genotyped platelets, only 10% were actually transfused with this type of blood component. This reaffirms the need for investments in a bank of genotyped platelet donors.

Abstract: Introduction
Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker of cellular proliferative history. In healthy individuals, leukocyte TL shortens with age and associates with the lifespan of men and women. However, most of studies had used linear regression models to address the association of the TL attrition, aging and sex.
Methods
We evaluated the association between the TL, aging and sex in a cohort of 180 healthy subjects by quantile regression. The TL of nucleated blood cells was measured by fluorescent in situ hypridization (flow-FISH) in a cohort of 89 men, 81 women, and 10 umbilical cord samples. The results were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and compared to a linear regression analysis.
Results
By quantile regression, telomere dynamics slightly differed between sexes with aging: women had longer telomeres at birth and slower attrition rate than men until the sixth decade of life; after that, TL eroded faster and became shorter than that in men. These differences were not observed by linear regression analysis, as the overall telomere attrition rates in women and men were similar (42 pb per year, p < 0.0001 vs. 45 pb kb per year, p < 0.0001). Also, qPCR did not recapitulate flow-FISH findings, as the telomere dynamics by qPCR followed a linear model.
Conclusion
The quantile regression analysis accurately reproduced a third-order polynomial TL attrition rate in both women and men, but it depended on the technique applied to measure TL. The Flow-FISH reproduced the expected telomere dynamics through life and, differently from the qPCR, was able to detect the subtle TL variations associated with sex and aging.

Abstract: Amorphic or defected oocytes and embryos are commonly observed in assisted reproductive technology (ART) laboratories. It is believed that a proper gene expression at each stage of embryo development contributes to the possibility of a decent-quality embryo leading to successful implantation. Many studies reported that several defects in embryo morphology are associated with gene expressions during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. There is lacking literature review on summarizing common morphological defects about gene alternations. In this review, we summarized the current literature. We selected 64 genes that have been reported to be involved in embryo morphological abnormalities in animals and humans, 30 of which were identified in humans and might be the causes of embryonic changes. Five papers focusing on associations of multiple gene expressions and embryo abnormalities using RNA transcriptomes were also included during the search. We have also reviewed our time-lapse image database with over 3000 oocytes/embryos to show morphological defects possibly related to gene alternations reported previously in the literature. This holistic review can better understand the associations between gene alternations and morphological changes. It is also beneficial to select important biomarkers with strong evidence in IVF practice and reveal their potential application in embryo selection. Also, identifying genes may help patients with genetic disorders avoid unnecessary treatments by providing preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single gene defects (PGT-M), reduce embryo replacements by less potential, and help scientists develop new methods for oocyte/embryo research in the near future.

Abstract: This study analyses the dilute GaAsBi as a candidate for the nominally 1.0 eV bandgap subcell in III-V multi-junction solar cells. The GaAsBi/InGaAs heterojunction solar cells are grown by molecular beam epitaxy pseudomorphically on thin InGaAs buffer layers to reduce GaAsBi lattice-mismatch with a GaAs substrate. We demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of 6.2%, one of the highest reported in GaAsBi-based solar cells thus far. The experimental photovoltaic and quantum efficiency measurements of the solar cells with intrinsic and n-type doped GaAsBi are modelled numerically to determine non-radiative recombination effects as well as optimal layer thickness and doping concentration to improve the performance. This work advances the GaAsBi-based device design and shows that current-matching conditions for a 3-junction inverted-growth solar cell could be achieved using a 1.0 eV GaAsBi bottom junction.

Abstract: Background
Post-induction hypotension, a common complication after propofol-based induction regimen, is a life-threatening challenge for anesthesiologists especially when unexpected pre-induction hypertension characterized by angiotensin release and increased vascular tone was presented by the same patient. Gap junctions (GJs) composed of connexin 43 (Cx43) have been considered a key factor in regulating vascular contraction and dilation. We aimed to explore the role of Cx43-GJs during peri-induction blood pressure fluctuation and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
Methods
Human umbilical arterial smooth muscle cells (HUASMCs) were pretreated by short-term Angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang Ⅱ) with or without subsequent propofol treatment to simulate transient contraction and dilation of vascular smooth muscle cells during anesthesia induction. F-actin polymerization, a classic indicator of HUASMCs constriction, was determined by F-actin staining assay. Both the function and expression of Cx43-GJs during transient contraction and dilation of HUASMCs, and their potential regulation of downstream Ca2+/RhoA/LIMK2/Cofilin signaling pathway were explored via different targeting inhibitors and siRNAs.
Results
Ang Ⅱ pretreatment significantly induced F-actin polymerization that indicate cell contraction, accompanied by enhanced GJs function on HUASMCs. With the inhibition of Cx43 GJs by the specific inhibitor, Gap26, and Cx43-siRNA, Ang Ⅱ-induced F-actin polymerization was reversed accompanied with the decrease of intracellular Ca2+ mobility and the RhoA/LIMK2/Cofilin signaling pathway activity. We also noticed that propofol application could inhibit GJs function, the same as Gap26. Simultaneously, intracellular Ca2+ mobility and RhoA/LIMK2/Cofilin signaling pathway activity on HUASMCs were both downregulated, finally resulting in downstream reduction of F-actin polymerization.
Conclusion
The function of Cx43-GJs lies in the center of Ang Ⅱ-induced contraction of HUASMCs, which potentially regulates intracellular Ca2+ mobility as well as RhoA/LIMK2/Cofilin signaling pathway activity. Propofol can reverse this effect induced by Ang Ⅱ through suppressing the function of Cx43-GJs.

Abstract: In this work, two novel terpyridine-Fe(II) coordination polymers (DTP-Fe and TTP-Fe) with nonconjugated linkers were developed for electrochromism and energy storage. Both coordination polymers exhibited efficient electrochromic switch between purple and pale yellow with optical contrast over 60%, short coloring time around 2 s, high coloration efficiency over 440 cm2 C−1, and good cycle stability. Moreover, the electrodes based on polymers DTP-Fe and TTP-Fe showed a specific capacitance of 21.42 and 35.84 mAh·g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. More important, we demonstrated that the three-arm star configuration may be superior to the conventional linear configuration for efficient electrochemical process, which resulted in the improved performance of the coordination polymer TTP-Fe. An asymmetric electrochromic supercapacitor based on TTP-Fe thin film and Prussian blue thin film was fabricated and possessed potential application in energy saving smart windows.

Abstract: Copper contamination risks are present throughout the whole crystalline silicon solar cell process flow, namely during ingot growth processes using recycled feedstock, wafer sawing and metallisation. Copper is a fast-diffusing impurity which can modify the carrier transport and recombination properties. The aim of this study is to present new insights into the properties of copper-contaminated highly doped and compensated silicon, with a focus on the copper diffusivity and the influence of this impurity on the majority carrier mobility and density. For this, compensated Czochralski silicon ingots were grown from electronic grade feedstock doped with boron and phosphorus, and the wafers intentionally contaminated with copper. Its concentrations were measured by Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry, while the electrical properties were extracted from Hall Effect measurements. The dopant concentrations were used to compute the effective diffusivity of interstitial copper and important changes in the copper diffusivity are expected in the vicinity of the p-type/n-type transition. For the n-type compensated wafers, a strong migration of copper atoms towards the surface and a reduced copper bulk content were highlighted. Furthermore, the presence of precipitates was experimentally revealed. Both the equilibrium electron density and electron mobility were not influenced by the contamination. In p-type compensated material, copper atoms did not accumulate at the surface, probably due to both the limited copper precipitation in p-type silicon and the lower copper diffusivity. In addition, the equilibrium hole density was not influenced. However, the hole carrier mobility was affected, likely associated to the higher bulk copper content.

Abstract: Background
The date of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis has been studied regarding potential etiologic roles with contrasting results and the issue remains controversial. The principal aim of this study was to analyze monthly variation of ALL diagnosis in a large homogenous Hispanic Latin American cohort over 15 years; its association with survival rates was also assessed.
Methods
Clinical files and electronic records of 501 consecutive patients of all ages with ALL in northeastern Mexico over the years of 2004–2018 were scrutinized. Patients were divided into children ≤18 and adults >18 years. The Chi–square heterogeneity analysis was used to test for non-uniform variation. The Poisson regression analysis was used to fit sinusoidal (harmonic) models to the data, using the month of diagnosis as a covariate in a separate model.
Results
During the study period 363 children (72.5%) and 138 adults (27.5%) (p < 0.001) were diagnosed with ALL. Heterogeneity across the months of diagnosis was confirmed (p = 0.019) and the Poisson regression analysis confirmed a significant monthly variation (p < 0.001) (95% CI, 3.024–3.745), a higher annual peak being observed in the month of March (p = 0.002), followed by a second peak in October (p = 0.026). The five-year OS for children was 68.2% (95% CI, 67.64–68.74) and for adults, 43.7% (95% CI, 42.67–44.71) (p < 0.001). No significant association between the month of diagnosis and OS was found (p = 0.789).
Conclusion
The monthly variation of ALL diagnosis was documented; these results confirm the heterogeneous behavior of the disease and appear to be consistent with an interplay of environmental and biologic factors. Further studies are needed to examine putative candidate agents.

Abstract: We analysed the electronic and optical properties of oxygen-related striations in n-type Czochralski silicon wafers that underwent polysilicon contact process using deep level transient spectroscopy and micro-photoluminescence. Band to band micro-photoluminescence spectra measured at low temperature (80 K) indicate that the dark striations with low lifetime originate from nano-scale oxygen precipitates. Deep level transient spectroscopy results indicate that such nano-scale precipitates cannot be considered as point defects and analysed with Shockley-Read-Hall recombination statistics, but must be treated as extended defects with a continuous spectrum of energies.

Abstract: Schizophrenia provides a quintessential disease model of how disturbances in the molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopment lead to disruptions in the emergence of cognition. The central and often persistent feature of this illness is the disorganisation and impoverishment of language and related expressive behaviours. Though clinically more prominent, the periodic perceptual distortions characterised as psychosis are non-specific and often episodic. While several insights into psychosis have been gained based on study of the dopaminergic system, the mechanistic basis of linguistic disorganisation and impoverishment is still elusive. Key findings from cellular to systems-level studies highlight the role of ubiquitous, inhibitory processes in language production. Dysregulation of these processes at critical time periods, in key brain areas, provides a surprisingly parsimonious account of linguistic disorganisation and impoverishment in schizophrenia. This review links the notion of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance at cortical microcircuits to the expression of language behaviour characteristic of schizophrenia, through the building blocks of neurochemistry, neurophysiology, and neurocognition.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis comprises a systemic hyperactivation of macrophages that requires prompt recognition of symptoms and early treatment.
Objective and Method
In this context, we described clinical and laboratory characteristics, therapeutic modality and outcome of 21 patients with HLH treated at a pediatric oncology hospital between January 2000 and February 2019.
Results
HLH mainly affected females, fever was the most frequent clinical sign and hyperferritinemia was the most prevalent laboratory abnormality. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at some point. Fifteen (71.4%) patients presented resolution criteria and eight (53.3%) of them presented reactivation. The mortality rate was 57.1% and the mean time between diagnosis and death was 9.98 months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 36.7%. We observed a significant difference in prognosis associated with reactivation of HLH. These patients demonstrated an estimated 5-year OS of 25%, while all patients that did not reactivate were alive until the end of the follow-up.
Conclusion
In conclusion, HLH is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, especially in patients with disease reactivation and those with familial- or immunodeficiency-associated forms, which makes early recognition and genetic testing crucial for appropriate management and prompt SCT indication.

Abstract: SnO2 is one of the most popular low-cost inorganic electron transport materials for perovskite solar cells. However, the agglomeration of SnO2 nanoparticles causes their uneven distribution and the existence of pinholes, seriously hindering the electron migration across SnO2/perovskite interface and limiting the device performance. The poor wettability between the SnO2 film and the perovskite precursor solution also impairs the growth of perovskite grains. In this work, an innovative strategy was employed to produce an organic-inorganic hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) by fabricating a high-quality polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/SnO2 perovskite film with few defects and good wettability. In turn, a PVP-SnO2 based device exhibits elevated power conversion efficiency (PCE) (18.98%) and adequate reproducibility along with superior operational stability.

Abstract: Dispersion of highly conductive nanoparticles in Phase Change Materials (PCMs) tends to improve the thermophysical properties of nanocomposites. The current research condenses the synthesis, chemical, physical, and thermal characterization of novel nano-enhanced eutectic phase change materials (NeUPCMs) dispersed with TiO2 nanofillers for thermal management applications. The base matrix primarily comprises of a eutectic of paraffin wax and palmitic acid. Detailed analysis of the uncertainty of each thermophysical property measured was performed. The synthesized nanocomposite logged a maximal thermal conductivity of 0.59 W/mK (2.3-fold as compared with the base-0.25 W/mK) with 0.5% nanofillers. The composites displayed excellent solar transmissivity (82%) as they were doped with nanofillers having a high refractive index. The latent heat of the NeUPCMs got enhanced by 17% whereas the melting point showed a slight decrement in nanocomposites. Further, zero phase segregation, no subcooling, stable phase transition temperature, and good chemical, and thermal stability were noted from digital scanning calorimetry results with NeUPCMs. The composites exhibited good thermal reliability beyond 500 thermal cycles. It could be potentially deployed in the thermal management of medium-temperature systems like PVT and LCPVT systems.

Abstract: Introduction
Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is an extracorporeal therapy which removes apolipoprotein B-containing particles from the circulation. We evaluated techniques and efficiency of lipoprotein apheresis procedures applied to patients with familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) at our center.
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated 250 LA procedures applied to 27 patients with dyslipidemia between March 2011 and August 2019.
Results
A total of 27 patients, of whom 19 (70.4%) were male and 8 (29.6%), female, were included. Eighteen (66.7%), 6 (22.2%) and 3 (11.1%) patients were diagnosed with non-FH, homozygous FH (HoFH) and heterozygous FH (HeFH), respectively. Two different apheresis techniques, direct adsorption of lipoproteins (DALI) (48.8%) and double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) (51.2%), were used. The change in the serum total cholesterol (TC) level was the median 302 mg/dl (171–604 mg/dl) (60.4%) in HoFH patients, 305 mg/dl (194–393 mg/dl) (60.8%) in HeFH patients and 227 mg/dl (75–749 mg/dl) (65.3%) in non-FH patients. The change in the serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level was the median 275 mg/dl (109–519 mg/dl) (64.2%), 232 mg/dl (207–291 mg/dl) (64.5%) and 325 mg/dl (22–735 mg/dl) (70.9%) in patients with HoFH, HeFH and non-FH, respectively. A significantly effective reduction in serum lipid levels, including TC, LDL and triglycerides, was achieved in all patients, regardless of the technique, p < .001. The decrease in the serum TC and LDL levels was significantly higher in the DFPP, compared to the DALI, being 220 mg/dl (−300 to 771) vs 184 mg/dl (64–415), p < .001 and 196 mg/dl (11–712) vs 157 mg/dl (54–340), p < .001, respectively.
Conclusions
Our results showed that LA is a highly effective treatment in reducing serum lipid levels and safe, without any major adverse event.

Abstract: High-temperature, dense granular flows along an inclined plane were considered for solar thermal energy transport and storage with sintered bauxite particles. A series of experiments was performed for particle inlet temperatures of ∼ 200, 400, 600, and 800 °C to understand the mechanisms of granular flows at extreme temperatures. Mass flow rates were measured using a load cell and free-surface velocities were measured and computed using particle image velocimetry. Surface temperatures were measured using infrared cameras. A significant decrease in steady-state particle mass flow rate was observed with increasing temperature due to changing flow properties. A decrease in bulk particle free-surface velocities was observed at higher temperatures. Free-surface velocity measurement error between experiments were within 20% of the average. The particle surface temperatures decreased from inlet to outlet with larger gradients at higher temperatures observed due to increasing convection and radiative heat losses. A decrease in temperature was observed along the side walls due to a decrease in particle velocities.

Abstract: Introduction: The Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded RNA genome virus, belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Outbreaks around the world have demonstrated that the presence of asymptomatic viremic blood donors provides an increase in the risk of transfusion transmission (TT) and nucleic acid test (NAT) screening has been proposed to ensure the blood safety. This study implemented an “in-house” method to detect ZIKV RNA in blood sample donations. Methods: Primary plasma tubes are submitted to nucleic acid extraction on an automated platform. After extraction, the NAT set-up is performed in the robotic pipettor, in which an amplification mixture containing primers and probes for ZIKV and Polio vaccine virus (PV) are added in duplex as an internal control. The real-time polymerase chain reaction is then performed in a thermocycler, using the protocol established by the supplier. Results: From May 2016 to May 2018, 3,369 samples were collected from 3,221 blood donors (confidence coefficient 95%), of which 31 were considered false positive (0.92%), as they did not confirm initial reactivity when repeated in duplicates and 14 (0.42%) had their results invalid due to repeat failure in the internal control, 4 (0.12%), due to insufficient sample volume and 2 (0.05%), due to automatic pipettor failures. No Zika RNA reactive sample was identified. Conclusion: The test showed feasible to be incorporated into the blood screening routine. Our data do not indicate the need to screen for ZIKV RNA in São Paulo during the evaluated period. However, a generic NAT system covering a group of flaviviruses which are circulating in the region, such as DENV and YFV, among others, could be a useful tool.

Abstract: Introduction
Constitutional symptoms and thrombohemorrhagic events are common in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Hence, the treatment’s primary goal is to control symptoms and improve the quality of life (QoL). In order to assess response to therapy, symptom burden, and QoL among patients with MPN, the “Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form - Total Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS)” questionnaire was developed in the USA in 2012. Herein, we translated and validated the MPN-SAF TSS questionnaire to Brazilian Portuguese.
Methods
The ten-item questionnaire was translated from the English language and its psychometric properties (reliability, convergent and construct validities) were evaluated in 101 MPN patients.
Results
There were 41 patients with essential thrombocythemia, 39 with myelofibrosis and 21 with polycythemia vera. The median age of all patients at diagnosis was 68 years and 59% were female. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the overall questionnaire was 0.78, ranging from 0.73 to 0.79, if each item was deleted. Validity analyses showed that the strongest item-item correlation were between early satiety and abdominal discomfort. Strong correlations were also found between physician and patient perceptions of itching (r=0.81) and fatigue (r=0.70). The Pearson coefficient correlation between the MPN-SAF TSS global score and the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional scales ranged from 0.51 to 0.64. The exploratory factor analysis showed that seven of the ten symptoms loaded into one single factor.
Conclusion
The Brazilian Portuguese version of the MPN-SAF-TSS showed good psychometric properties and can be an available tool to assess symptom burden in this group of patients.

Abstract: Liquid-solid organic phase change materials (PCMs) exist shortcomings of leakage, poor solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency, and flammability, which restrict the application scope of solar-thermal energy storage. To meet these problems, PCMs (ZrP-PI@PEG) with excellent thermal energy storage, solar-to-thermal conversion, and flame retardancy were fabricated in this study. The polyimide (PI)/sodium lignosulfonate-zirconium phosphate (SL-ZrP) hybrid-aerogels (ZrP-PI) were prepared by freeze-drying and thermal imidization. ZrP-PI aerogels composited with polyethylene glycol (PEG) via vacuum impregnation to fabricate the composite PCMs (CPCMs, ZrP-PI@PEG). The in-situ biochar generated from SL-ZrP increases both solar-to-thermal conversion and flame retardant of CPCMs. The final result demonstrates that ZrP-PI@PEG exhibits a superior adsorption ratio (95.5%) and outstanding latent heat (157.67 J/g), as well as about 13% flame retardant index decrease in heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release rate (THR). Furthermore, ZrP-PI@PEG shows great thermal stability and reliability after conducting a leakage experiment and thermal cycling test. These superior resultants indicate that ZrP-PI@PEG has a good potential for widespread and long-term use in solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Organic-based photovoltaic devices emerged as a complementary technology to silicon solar cells with specific advantages in terms of cost, ease of deployment, semi-transparency, and performance under low and diffuse light conditions. In this work, thin-film boron-doped diamond (B:NCD) electrodes are employed for their useful optical, electronic, and chemical properties, as well as stability and environmental safety. A set of oligothiophene perylene diimide (nT-PDI) donor-acceptor chromophores is designed and synthesized in order to investigate the influence of the oligothiophene spacer length when the nT-PDI molecule is attached to a B:NCD electrode. The chromophores are anchored to the diamond surface via diazonium grafting followed by Sonogashira cross-coupling. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the surface coverage decreases with increasing oligothiophene length. Density functional theory (DFT/TDDFT) calculations reveal the upright nT-PDI orientation and the most efficient photogenerated charge separation and injection to diamond for elongated oligothiophene chains (8T-PDI). Yet, the maximum photovoltage is obtained for an intermediate oligothiophene length (3T-PDI), providing an optimum between decreasing transport efficiency and increasing efficiency of charge separation and reduced recombination with increasing oligothiophene length. Holes transferred from nT-PDI to diamond persist there even after the illumination is switched off. Such features may be beneficial for application in solar cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Culturing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) is a key point in different fields of research, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and studies of the bone marrow microenvironment. However, isolating and expanding murine BM-MSCs in vitro has challenged researchers due to the low purity and yield of obtained cells. In this study, we aimed to evaluate five different protocols to culture murine BM-MSCs in vitro.
Methods
All protocols were based on the adhesion capacity of BM-MSCs to the tissue culture plastic surface and varied in the types of plate, culture media, serum, additional supplementation and initial cell density. Flow cytometry analysis was used to investigate lineage purity after expansion.
Results
The expression of CD45 and CD11b was detected in the cultures generated according to all protocols, indicating low purity with the presence of hematopoietic cells and macrophages. The cellular growth rate and morphology varied between the cultures performed according to each protocol. Cells cultured according to protocol 5 (8 × 107cells/plate, Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) culture medium during first passage and then Iscove's Modified Delbecco's Medium (IMDM) culture medium, both supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum, 9% horse serum, 12µM L-glutamine) presented the best performance, with a satisfactory growth rate and spindle-shape morphology.
Conclusion
Our results point out that the purity and satisfactory growth rate of murine BM-MSC cultures are not easily achieved and additional approaches must be tested for a proper cell expansion.

Abstract: IFITM proteins are a host restriction factor with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, but the role in the paramyxovirus entry remains unclear. Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus of the paramyxoviridae with extremely high lethality. Here, we assessed the role of IFITM3 on NiV G and F glycoprotein-mediated virus entry. Using NiV pseudovirus bearing NiV G and F proteins to infect IFITM3-induced MDCK cells, we found that overexpression of IFITM3 promotes NiV G and F proteins-mediated virus entry. Mechanistically, the subcellular distribution showed that F protein completely co-localized with IFITM3, but G protein does not. Immunoprecipitation further indicated that IFITM3 strongly captures F protein rather than G protein. F protein truncation found that the F1 subunit completely co-localized and captures with IFITM3, but not the F2 subunit. Furthermore, IFITM3 strongly binds to F1 truncations containing fusion peptide (FP), and F1 strongly captures IFITM3 truncation with the intramembrane domain (IMD). Together, the results suggest that IFITM3 can promote NiV G and F proteins-mediated virus entry into MDCK cells, and IFITM3 directly interacts with the F1 subunit of NiV F protein dependent on the former's IMD and the latter's FP, which may occur after incorporation of fusion peptides into the cell membrane following virus fusion activation.

Abstract: Alkali metal post-deposition treatment (PDT) is a key factor to approach high efficiency in Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells. In addition to single alkali element treatment, co-doping of light and heavy alkali elements is also applied to the preparation of CIGS absorber for higher efficiency. In this work, the details of different methods of alkali-treatments are revealed by combining several microstructural and compositional analysis methods, especially for the NaF-PDT/CsF-PDT process which introduces extra Na before Cs into the absorber. The ion exchange of Na and Cs in the grain boundaries (GB) of the absorber is analyzed in detail, which reveals alkali-treatment restrains the formation of large bandgap compounds at GB. Extensive material analysis shows that NaF/CsF-PDT can not only tailor the surface nanoscale morphology of CIGS films but also optimize the band structure at GB to reduce carrier recombination. Such modification gains the improvement of the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 15.2% to 17.4% and average PCE from 14.3% to 16.5% (without antireflective coating) after NaF/CsF-PDT. According to the analysis of data, we propose a model of energy band at GB, which explains the reason why NaF/CsF-PDT shows a better effect on CIGS devices than CsF-PDT. These results could serve as a basis for the further understanding of the effects of alkali-PDT on CIGS film and help to achieve even higher efficiency.

Abstract: Passive daytime radiant cooling (PDRC) technology is an energy-free and ecologically beneficial cooling solution compared to conventional electric cooling. The limited cooling efficiency and impossibility of mass manufacture, however, severely restrict its popularization and application. This study uses a combination of template and etching techniques to construct a hierarchically porous Poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (P(VDF-HFP) coating with controlled pore size and porosity. Coated textiles have strong solar reflectances (0.93) and infrared emittances (0.98) thanks to the organization of specific micro-nano multi-level pore size and high porosity, which results in a subambient temperature drop of around 9.0 °C. Due to its porous structure, the coated textile possesses a considerable bit of flexibility and self-cleaning capabilities. The present work paves a new way for the mass production of radiate cooling textiles with a controlled coating structure and exceptional cooling performance.

Abstract: The growth of heavily doped tunnel junctions in inverted metamorphic multijunction solar cells induces a strong diffusion of Zn via a point-defects-assisted mechanism. The redistribution of Zn can compensate the n-type doping in the emitter of the GaInP top junction, degrading severely the conductivity of the whole solar cell and its conversion efficiency. This work evaluates different epitaxial growth strategies to achieve control on the [Zn] profile of an inverted metamorphic triple-junction structure, including: the reduction of the doping concentration in the tunnel junction to minimize the injection of point defects that trigger the diffusion mechanism; the use of different barrier layers to keep the injected point defects away from active layers and, finally, the minimization of Zn concentration in the AlGaInP back-surface-field layer of the GaInP subcell. This last approach enables a high-conductivity multijunction solar cell device without redesigning the tunnel junction as well as a high electronic quality in the GaInP subcell, which shows a collection efficiency higher than 93% and an open-circuit-voltage offset of 410 mV at 1 sun irradiance. The characterization of final triple-junction devices, including quantum efficiency, electroluminescence, and light current-density-voltage curves at different irradiances, demonstrates a successful integration of all the subcell and tunnel junction components. This way, final solar cells with peak efficiencies exceeding 40% at ∼500 suns are demonstrated, despite using doping levels as low as 1·1017 cm−3 in the AlGaInP:Zn back-surface-field of the GaInP subcell and using non-optimized antireflective coatings.

Abstract: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and serious respiratory illness with substantial morbidity and mortality. Circular RNAs have been demonstrated to participate in various diseases processes. However, the biological function and mechanism of most circular RNAs have not been elucidated in ARDS. In this study, we found that circUBXN7 was significantly increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced A549 and Beas-2B cell injury. Inhibition of circUBXN7 significantly promoted cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis, while overexpression of circUBXN7 suppressed cell proliferation and accelerated cell apoptosis in LPS-induced A549 and Beas-2B cells. CircUBXN7 acted as a sponge for miR-622, and miR-622 rescued the effect of circUBXN7 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. We also found that IL6ST was a target gene of miR-622, and the expression of IL6ST was indirectly regulated by circUBXN7. Furthermore, western blotting indicated that the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway was involved in the circUBXN7/miR-622/IL6ST axis in LPS-induced A549 and Beas-2B cell injury. Overall, our study suggested that circUBXN7 suppressed cell proliferation and facilitated cell apoptosis by sponging miR-622 and regulating IL6ST, to activate the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway in LPS-induced A549 and Beas-2B cell injury. CircUBXN7 might therefore be a potential biomarker for ARDS, and dysregulation of circUBXN7 may be involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS.

Abstract: High performance narrow-bandgap GaInNAsSb solar cells are instrumental for the development of lattice-matched GaAs-based solar cells with more than four junctions. To this end a comprehensive optimization process including the effects of growth temperature, As/III beam equivalent pressure ratio, and Sb flux on the performance of 0.8 eV GaInNAsSb solar cells grown by molecular beam epitaxy is reported. For this, sets of GaInNAsSb p-i-n solar cell structures with 5–6% nitrogen compositions were fabricated, while varying the key growth parameters. The quantum efficiency and current generation increased significantly when the narrow gap materials were grown at elevated growth temperatures, close to phase separation. A further improvement in the current generation was observed by employing lower As/III beam equivalent pressure ratios. The best GaInNAsSb cell exhibited about 94% peak external quantum efficiency and generated a short-circuit current of 17.7 mA/cm2 with AM1.5D (1000 W/m2) illumination at wavelengths above 900 nm without employing a back surface reflector. Our analysis indicates that the best cell is already close to being absorption limited. While the N composition should be kept as low as possible (i.e., ≲5%) to achieve high performance, increasing the Sb flux generally results in improved the material quality, i.e., leading to a slight improvement for the open-circuit voltages and fill factors. In addition, it was found that the phase separation observed at the growth temperature of 480 °C could effectively be inhibited by employing higher Sb fluxes.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells are at the forefront of high efficiency industrial solar cell manufacturing. The rapid increase in efficiency compared with passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) cells has significantly propelled commercial interest in this technology. Illuminated annealing under elevated temperatures has been shown to lead to efficiency enhancements in SHJ cells. Recently, it was observed that increasing the light intensity used during the annealing can accelerate the efficiency gains, this approach has started to be incorporated into SHJ manufacturing. In this work, we investigate the kinetics of this high intensity illuminated annealing process in the temperature range from 200 °C to 300 °C, demonstrating that the kinetics and extent of the efficiency gain strongly depend on the temperature of the process. For the first time, we show that the changes in VOC and RS, which control the efficiency enhancement, occur at different rates. Remarkably, by investigating the temperature dependence we demonstrate a process that leads to efficiency gains of >0.4%abs in only 1 s. This new understanding presents a pathway to an industrially compatible annealing approach that significantly increases the power output of SHJ modules.

Abstract: Notum, which belongs to the α/β hydrolase family, is a deacylated extracellular protein that regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. Studies have found that Notum participates in the progression of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, but its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is currently unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of Notum in regulating OSCC and further reveal the underlying mechanisms. Various approaches including bioinformatics analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the expression of Notum in OSCC cells and tissues. Cell counting kit-8 assay, clone formation assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and in-gel zymography assay were explored to evaluate the regulation of Notum in OSCC proliferation and migration. Hoechst 33342/PI assay, cell immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and in vivo tumorigenesis experiment were applied for OSCC apoptosis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for mRNA level while western blotting was conducted to detect protein expression. The results showed that Notum was highly expressed in OSCC tissues and cells, and Notum promoted the proliferation and migration of OSCC cells while it inhibited their apoptosis. Furthermore, signaling pathway analysis showed that Notum led to potential pro-survival of OSCC through crosstalk between sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling via phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta. These results will help to elucidate the mechanism and also provide new ideas for targeted treatment of OSCC.

Abstract: Introduction
Leg ulcers (LUs) are relatively common in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). The role of inflammation and nitric oxide (NO) pathways in the pathophysiology of the LU is not understood.
Objective
The aim of this study was to verify the association between inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) and the occurrence of the LU in patients with SCA.
Method
It was a cross-sectional study on adult participants with SCA followed at Fundação Hemominas, a public blood center in Brazil. Eligible participants were recruited and included in one of two groups: Group 1, comprised of cases with SCA (Hb SS) and at least one LU at the time of inclusion in the study and Group 2, comprised of controls with SCA without a history of LU, matched by sex and age to cases. Participants were interviewed to obtain sociodemographic data and blood samples were collected. Clinical and laboratory data were abstracted from medical records. Nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) and inflammatory molecules were quantified using an immunoassay and Multiplex xMAP® technology, respectively. Eighty-seven individuals were included, ranging in age from 17 to 61 years (mean 40 ± 10.7 years); 30 had LU and 57 were controls without LU.
Results
Participants with LU had significantly higher levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-10, IL-15, NOx and platelet and white blood cell (WBC) counts, when compared to those without LU. Participants with LU had a significantly higher risk of having a history of osteomyelitis and a higher use of antiseptic soap in bathing, when compared to those without LU.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results showed that NOx, inflammatory molecules and hematological features were associated with LU in Brazilian adults with SCA.

We evaluated the relevance of using the smudge cell percentage in the blood smear as a prognostic marker in CLL.
Methods
In this prospective study, 42 untreated Senegalese patients with CLL were enrolled. The diagnosis was established, based on the peripheral blood count and flow cytometry using the Matutes score. Cytogenetic aberrations, assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), were available for 30 patients, while the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGVH) mutation status was performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 24 patients. The SC percentage was determined in the blood smear, as previously described. Statistical analyses were executed using the GraphPad Prism 8.
Results
The mean age was 63 years (48 - 85) and the male: female sex ratio was 4.66. A low SC (< 30%) percentage was correlated with Binet stage B/C (p = 0.0009), CD38 expression (p = 0.039), unmutated IGVH status (p = 0.0009) and presence of cytogenetic abnormalities (for del 13q, p = 0.0012, while for other cytogenetic aberrations, p = 0.016). An inverse correlation was found between the SC percentage and the absolute lymphocyte count (r = -0.51) and patients with higher percentage of SCs had a prolonged survival. However, there was no correlation between the SC percentage and age (p = 0.41) or gender (median, 19% for males vs. 20% for females; p = 0.76).
Conclusion
When less than 30%, the SC was associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. Easy and affordable, the percentage of SCs in a blood smear could be a reliable prognostic marker, accessible to all CLL patients, mainly those in developing countries.

Abstract: Introduction
Although several combination therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have emerged recently, there has been a lack of published surveys and educational projects focused on these important treatment options. We aimed to improve the oncology team members’ knowledge and awareness of several FDA approved combination therapies for AML, including glasdegib (DAURISMO®), venetoclax (VENCLEXTA®), GO (MYOLOTARG®),CPX-351 (VYXEOS®), and midostaurin (RYDAPT®). Additionally, we aimed to examine these teams’ perspectives, views, and attitudes towards these topics and finally identify barriers to the implementationof such therapies in clinical practice.
Method
Initially, we developed booklets and then distributed them to each participating oncology and hematology office. Subsequently, all participating oncology and hematology team members were asked to complete an anonymous online survey to test their knowledge of and attitudes toward the subjects.
Main results
There was a total of 52 survey respondents. The correct answer regarding various combination therapies for AML was identified by nearly 70% or more of survey takers. The level of awareness of project subjects significantly improved after reading our printing materials. Many survey respondents were motivated to learn more about combination therapies for AML as well as discuss these topics with others.
Conclusions
Our booklets effectively improved understanding and awareness of combination therapies for AML. Future studies should explore awareness, knowledge, and perception of other new and emerging combination therapies for AML among oncology and hematology team members in other areas.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) are extensively used in passive thermal management and heat storage owing to their high latent heats near phase change temperatures. However, low thermal conductivity and leakage are two persistent bottlenecks in applications of PCMs. In this study, a new absorption-polymerization method is proposed to prepare phase change composites (PCCs) with both high thermal conductivity, high enthalpy, high encapsulation ratio, and leakage-proof property. The PCCs are synthesized in two steps: (1) absorption: n-hexadecane (C16) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) are absorbed into expanded graphite (EG) network; (2) polymerization: the absorbed MMA is subsequently polymerized to encapsulate C16 and form core-shell microcapsules in the EG networks. The PCCs exhibit latent heats of 170–200 J/g, encapsulation ratios of 72–85%, and thermal conductivities of 0.8–3.9 W/(m·K). In addition, the PCCs exhibit good dynamic response and long-term cycle stability. The absorption-polymerization process is an efficient and cost-effective method of synthesizing high-performance PCCs, which is promising for various heat-related applications, such as heat collection for renewable energy, energy conservation in buildings, and thermal protection of electronic equipment.

Abstract: Introduction
Thromboembolic events occur due to an imbalance in the hemostasis and some factors associated with this condition can be inherited. In order to evaluate the frequency of genotypes considered to be common hereditary risk factors for thrombophilia associated with venous thrombosis (g.1691G > A and g.20210G > A) and hyperhomocysteinemia (g.677C > T and g.1298A > C), samples from voluntary healthy blood donors at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre were tested.
Methods
We examined 325 blood samples from blood donors collected from October 2017 to July 2018. Blood was collected on filter paper and the DNA was extracted for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis using the qualitative real time polymerase chain reaction.
Results
The calculated frequencies of each genetic variant in heterozygosity were 4% for the FV gene (g.1691G > A), 4% for the F2 gene (g.20210G > A) and 42% and 39% for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), g.677C > T and g.1298A > C, respectively. Only the genetic variants of MTHFR were found in homozygosity, with frequencies of 14% and 6% (g.677C > T and g.1298A > C), respectively.
Discussion
Altogether, these results describe the frequencies of genetic variants associated with venous thrombosis and hyperhomocysteinemia in the analyzed group and are important to enhance our current knowledge about the genetic profiles of Brazilian blood donors.

Abstract: Introduction
Erythrocyte phenotyping is a very important test in the adoption of prophylactic measures to reduce transfusion reactions/alloimmunizations in polytransfused patients. The blood group Diego, in its current, form has 22 antigens, of which 4 are immunogenic, being Diª/Dib and Wra/Wrb, while the others are less expressive. The antigen Diª is of low incidence among whites and blacks, however, it is common in the South American indigenous and Asian Mongolian populations. It is also considered a system of clinical importance for its immunogenicity.
Method
The present study aimed to carry out a retrospective and descriptive survey of the frequency of the Diª antigen in the blood donor population at the HEMOPA Foundation Coordinating Blood Center from 12/2018 to 1/2000. The data obtained were from the HEMOPA Foundation SBS Progress and SBS WEB Systems databases.
Results
During this period, 941,744 blood bags were collected and, of these, 930 bags were phenotyped for the Diª antigen, of which 842 were negative and 88 (9.7%) positive. The research showed that, among the positive donors for the antigen Diª, 88.6% were brown, 3.4%, black and 8%, white. In the statistical analysis, the frequency observed was higher in browns.
Conclusion
In the present investigation, we concluded that our region has a relatively higher frequency of the Diª antigen, when compared to the rest of Brazil, and it occurs more often in browns.

Abstract: Introduction
Hematologic abnormalities are common in HIV and involve all blood cell lineages. A study on cytopenias, as correlated with disease progression, can be valuable in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to determine the hematologic profile of HIV patients and its association with CD4 count and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study involving adult Filipino HIV patients with complete blood count (CBC) and CD4 count determinations prior to the initiation of ARV treatment and after ≥6 months of ARV treatment. Logistic regression was performed to determine the association between cytopenias and a CD4 count <200 cells/µL.
Results
The study included 302 patients. Anemia was the most common cytopenia. Anemia and leukopenia were associated with an increased likelihood of having a CD4 count <200 cells/µL in ARV-naïve patients. In ARV-treated patients, leukopenia was associated with an increased probability of having a CD4 count <200 cells/µL. An increase in hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts was observed after ≥6 months of ARV treatment.
Conclusion
Anemia and leukopenia can be used as markers of immune status in HIV-infected individuals and improvement in the CBC parameters can be used to assess response to ARV treatment. Routine monitoring of hematologic parameters is recommended.

Abstract: Global warming has highlighted the urgency of implementing renewable energy technologies. Solar-driven water evaporation has attracted significant attention because solar radiation is a green (i.e., renewable) energy source that can be applied for seawater desalination purposes. Various materials have been developed to promote the transformation of solar energy to heat to enhance the efficiency of steam generation. However, developing materials that are suitable for long-term applications, i.e., with high mechanical strength and antifouling resistance, is challenging. This report describes the preparation of carbon-coated glass fiber cloth (C-GFC) using a polymer pyrolysis method. The C-GFC exhibited high mechanical strength (240 MPa), anti-corrosion properties in acidic and alkaline environments, light absorption over 95%, and good hydrophilicity. After integrating the C-GFC into a three-layer evaporation generator device, the evaporation rate exceeded 1.5 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun, with 88% thermal conversion efficiency. Moreover, the C-GFC materials maintained their initial evaporation rate even after long-term treatment in acidic, alkaline, and seawater environments. The developed carbon-coated glass fiber cloth materials therefore demonstrate promising potential for photothermal water conversion applications.

Abstract: Introduction
The optimization of oral health before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is important for preventing infectious complications during treatment.
Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate the oral health condition and dental treatments performed in patients in pre-allogeneic HCT.
Method
The records of patients treated during 2018 at a Brazilian HCT service were reviewed. The following oral health data were obtained: 1. Decayed, missing and filled teeth / correlated index for primary dentition (DMFT/dmft); 2. Quality of oral hygiene and 3. Dental pathologies: 3.1 Periodontal infectious focus, 3.2 Endodontic infectious focus and 3.3 Carie incidence. All dental procedures performed were surveyed.
Results
Thirty-three patients were included, with a mean age of 28.42 (±16.37), 20 male (60%) and 13 female. The average DMFT/dmft found in this study was 10.24 (± 8.37), similar to the index found in the population in southeastern Brazil. The younger study population presented a DMFT/dmft considered high, when compared to the general population. A total of 27.2% of the patients had active caries lesions, 33.3%, foci of periodontal infection, 15.1%, endodontic infectious focus and 40%, poor oral hygiene. Almost half of the patients (48.4%) had to undergo dental intervention, 24.2% needing periodontal scaling, 21.2%, fillings and 12.1%, tooth extractions.
Conclusion
We conclude that the studied population had an important incidence of dental pathologies and infectious conditions that could complicate throughout HCT, especially in younger patients, therefore presenting a high demand for dental treatment in the pre-HCT. Studies that assess the impact of dental conditioning on the outcomes of HCT with an emphasis on dental infectious complications, days of hospitalization and survival are necessary.”

Abstract: The cyclic stability enhancement of the CaO/CaCO3 thermochemical energy storage system is crucial for high-temperature thermal utilization of solar energy. In this study, we successfully enhance the long-term durability of calcium-looping composites by co-doping TiO2 and MgCl2 based on lattice energy and phase combination/separation mechanism. According to molecular dynamics simulations of metallic oxides, TiO2 shows higher thermal stability and better doping effects in calcium-looping materials. Further experiments indicate that the phase combination mechanism acting on high-valance metallic oxides like TiO2 can promote cyclic stability of calcium-looping materials. The calcium-based composite doped with 10 mol% TiO2 prepared by wet-mixing method exhibits high energy storage performance in 15 cycles. MgCl2 is also used as a dopant to improve cyclic stability of the calcium-based composite in long-term cycles further. The energy storage performance of the composite doped with 5 mol% TiO2 and 5 mol% MgCl2 is superior to single-doped composites. The average effective conversion ratio is 0.54 in 100 cycles and the energy storage densities are close to 1000 kJ/kg in most of the calcination/carbonation cycles. Microstructure characterizations indicate that the co-doped composite has abundant micropores and smaller particles with the more uniform size distribution. The modification mechanism at atomic scale will serve as guidelines for dopant selection preliminarily, and the novel TiO2/MgCl2 co-doped calcium-based composite is promising for long-term industrial applications, such as high-temperature thermal utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: Besides our understanding of the effects of ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection on neural progenitors’ cells the pathogenesis of this RNA virus also involves antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms that control gene activation and repression associated with the macrophage response to acute ZIKV infection are not fully understood. We approached the issue by RNA-seq and miRNA-seq datasets to understand the genetic program of ZIKV-infected macrophages. Results indicate that macrophage activates a regulatory program, involving 1067 differentially expressed genes. These genetic programs induced an inflammatory response mediated by chemokines as well as an interferon-independent anti-viral response, presumptively activated by IL-27. Additionally, the pathogenetic process involves changes in other signaling pathways such as cellular stress, cell signaling, metabolism, and cell differentiation. Furthermore, transcriptional control analysis revealed regulatory functions of key transcription factors principally, NFκB and STAT1, as well as HIF1A, ETV7, and PRMD1 that are associated with metabolic reprogramming during viral infection. We also noted six long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may act in the regulation of gene expression, including MROCKI and ZC2HC1A-2, that are involved in the inflammatory response and expression of the cytokines, respectively. On the other hand, post-transcriptional control by miRNAs, including miR-155–5p and miR-146a-5p, are associated with modulation of genes related to inflammatory and antiviral responses. Relevant to the post-transcriptional control, our data unveiled the role of RNA binding proteins that have diverse functions such as ribonucleases (PNPT1, ZC3H12A, and ZC3HAV1), splicing factors (SSB, RBM11, and RAVER2), and RNA modifiers (PARP10 and PARP14). Overall, the results establish an unbiased approach to discerning the wiring of a regulatory mechanism controlling the genetic program in ZIKV-infected macrophages.

Abstract: The solar absorptance of a thermal receiver surface significantly affects the photothermal conversion efficiency of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The development of low-cost Gen3 CSP systems calls for increasing the solar absorptance of the thermal receivers at operating temperatures above 750 °C. This study presents an innovative approach of fractal, multiscale texturing of absorber surfaces to significantly enhance solar energy absorption for Gen3 CSP applications. The absorber surface is described in terms of its fractal parameters that are uniquely determined from surface profile measurements. The interaction of solar radiation with the fractal surface is numerically simulated by solving the governing Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic wave propagation to investigate the effect of texturing on the absorptance of the surfaces. It is shown that absorption of the solar spectrum increases with an increase in the fractal dimension and the multiscale asperity height of the surface texturing. The theoretical model is demonstrated to be in close agreement with experimental measurements of spectral absorptance of electrodeposited copper (Cu), copper mono-oxide (CuO), and copper-manganese oxide (CuMnO) surfaces that are textured to produce a range of fractal parameters by tailoring the deposition parameters. Fractal surface texturing is shown to reduce reflectance by over one order of magnitude, yielding an absorptance of greater than 0.98 for CuMnO. For the first time, the study presents an effective means of significantly increasing solar absorptance and a fundamental theoretical description of the underlying physics.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are critical life-threatening disorders characterized by an excessive influx of neutrophils into the alveolar space. Neutrophil infiltration is a multi-step process involving the sequential engagement of adhesion molecules. The adhesion molecule CD11b/CD18 acts as an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to lung tissues in the ALI model. B-cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31), an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein, has been reported to regulate the cellular anterograde transport of CD11b/CD18 in human neutrophils. To explore how BAP31 regulates CD11b/CD18 in mouse neutrophils, we constructed myeloid-specific BAP31 knockdown mice in this study. Biological investigations indicated that BAP31 deficiency could significantly alleviated lung injury, as evidenced by the improved histopathological morphology, reduced pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio, inhibited myeloperoxidase level and decreased neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Further studies clarified that BAP31 deficiency obviously down-regulated the expression of CD11b/CD18 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) by deactivating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Collectively, our results revealed that BAP31 depletion exerted a protective effect on ALI, which was possibly dependent on the attenuation of neutrophil adhesion and infiltration by blocking the expression of adhesion molecules CD11b/CD18 and PSGL-1. These findings implied the potential of BAP31 as an appealing protein to mediate the occurrence of ALI.

Abstract: Very recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been proposed with both new device structure and materials to replace the conventional Methyl Ammonium-based structures in order to develop cells with higher operational stability. All-perovskite solar cells are the most emerging class of organic-inorganic PSCs which combine the photogeneration and absorption capability of two different perovskite materials to ensure both photo conversion performance and device operational stability. This simulation work aims to develop a systematic investigation of an all-perovskite solar cell structure made of CsPbI3/FAPbI3 heterojunctions using wxAMPS-1D platform supported with Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to analyze the band structure of both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 materials. The quantum efficiency, device characteristics, and degradation trend have been optimized against the thickness of perovskite layers. The optimum thicknesses are obtained to be 200 nm for CsPbI3 layer at an assumed thickness range of∼300 nm for FAPbI3 as stated in different literature, 30 nm for TiO2 electron transporting layer, and 80 nm for Spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting layer. The optimized CsPbI3/FAPbI3 bilayer all-perovskite solar cell results in 19.94% efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current density (Jsc = 24.5 mA/cm2), and open circuit voltage (Voc = 1.1 V), and a fill factor (FF) = 74%. The bilayer structure (CsPbI3/FAPbI3) shows 20% improvement in external quantum efficiency (in visible range), compared to the cell made of single CsPbI3 or FAPbI3 layer. Moreover, the degradation analysis shows that increasing the mid-gap defect density (in both layers) up to 1015 cm−3 was detrimental to device performance.

Abstract: Light-driven PEG/Ti3C2Tx form-stable phase change films for energy storage crosslinked by Co2+ were prepared through facile solution mixing. It is the strong interactions among PEG, Ti3C2Tx and Co2+ that endowed the system with excellent form-stability with only 5.0 wt% supporting. And the latent heat of samples was 142.1 J/g with light-thermal conversion and storage efficiency higher than 86.9%. Meanwhile, the samples possessed improved thermal stability and favorable thermal reliability. The fabricated films with comprehensive properties shows great perspective to be used in energy storage devices.

Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract, with a high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis. With advancements in disease research, the role of epigenetic changes in its pathogenesis has become a research focus. The known epigenetic changes mainly include DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation of chromatin structure. This article details the effects of these changes that would result in gastric cancer. Using next-generation sequencing methods and bioinformatics analysis, we can determine the epigenetic changes in abnormal tissues of the digestive tract that facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer patients. In this article, we summarize how epigenetic changes determine gastric cancer and the new technologies used in research on cancer to benefit gastric cancer patients.

Abstract: Polymer electrolytes are the key composite for all-solid electrochromic devices due to their unique properties including high ionic conductivity, good flexibility, etc. However, such applications are still impeded by the poor mechanical strength. In this study, novel quasi-solid polymer/ionic liquid composite electrolyte is constructed and the tensile strength is greatly enhanced by coupling epoxy composite with glass fibers (GFs) as the reinforcement. The tensile strength of the composite electrolyte is tripled and reaches 7.6 MPa after optimizing the content of GFs with the ionic conductivity of 1.75 × 10−5 S cm−1. Then, a dual-coloring electrochromic device fabricated with the composite electrolyte presents excellent switching stability (18000 cycles, >180000 s), fast response (˂2 s), ultra-high coloring efficiency (η = 451 cm2/C) and low driving voltage (±1 V). In addition, a substrate-free and flexible electrochromic device based on the composite electrolyte is successfully assembled, which demonstrates remarkable electrochromic behaviors, unique flexibility and mechanical stability. This work may promote the development of low-cost, easily-assembled, ultrahigh-flexible and high-performance electrochromic devices.

Abstract: Sleep requires that we disconnect from the environment, losing the ability to promptly respond to stimuli. There must be at least one essential function that justifies why we take this risk every day, and that function must depend on the brain being offline. We have proposed that this function is to renormalize synaptic weights after learning has led to a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. Without this renormalization, synaptic activity would become energetically too expensive and saturation would prevent new learning. There is converging evidence from molecular, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural experiments showing a net increase in synaptic strength after the major wake phase, and a net decline after sleep. The evidence also suggests that sleep-dependent renormalization is a smart process of synaptic down-selection, comprehensive and yet specific, which could explain the many beneficial effects of sleep on cognition. Recently, a key molecular mechanism that allows broad synaptic weakening during sleep was identified. Other mechanisms still being investigated should eventually explain how sleep can weaken most synapses but afford protection to some, including those directly activated by learning. That synaptic down-selection takes place during sleep is by now established; why it should take place during sleep has a plausible explanation; how it happens is still work in progress.

Abstract: Introduction
Prevalence of RhD negative phenotype in Nigeria is low; this leads to scarcity of RhD negative red cells for transfusion. Serological and molecular genotyping of RhD negative individuals for weak D types could reduce this scarcity. The aim of this study was to determine the serological prevalence and molecular types of weak D phenotypes among blood donors and pregnant women in Kano, Nigeria.
Methods
A total of 4482 blood donors and pregnant women from three hospitals in Kano were recruited. An indirect antiglobulin test was used to determine weak D phenotypes. Molecular genotyping was performed on genomic DNA from whole blood amplified by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) with agarose gel electrophoresis.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 26.50 ± 5.79 years. The prevalence of the RhD negative phenotype was 4.2% (189/4482). Of the 189 RhD negative phenotypes, 20 (10.6%) were weak D positive. Molecular genotyping of the 20 Weak D positive phenotypes revealed 15 (75%) weak D type 4, of which 11 were due to the RHD*09.03 and RHD*DAR3 (T201R, F223V) polymorphisms and 4, due to RHD* 08.01 and RHD* DFV polymorphisms; 2 (10%) were due to the 602 C>G polymorphism, while the remaining 3 (15%) constituted partial D or other rare weak D types.
Conclusion
The prevalence of weak D positive phenotypes is high in this study; weak D type 4 is the most common RhD genetic variant. Routine serologic weak D testing of RhD negative blood and molecular genotyping should be encouraged in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: The electronic properties of CsPbBr3 thin films cast through a solution route are known to depend on the stoichiometry of the precursors. In this work, with the aid of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) studies, a complete energy landscape has been derived for the all-inorganic perovskite formed with a wide range of precursor stoichiometries. While the optical band gap of the perovskite is known to remain unchanged with a variation in the stoichiometry, we show the manner in which their Fermi energy, valence band (VB), and conduction band (CB) edges shift. The variation in the energy levels has been correlated to the presence of defects. Since the formation energy of different intrinsic point defects depends on the growth environment, the nature of defects has depended on the precursor stoichiometry used during the formation of the perovskites. The presence of defects has thereby tuned the Fermi energy and the type of electronic conductivity in CsPbBr3 as well. Here, the CB and VB edges have responded due to the self-doping process. Finally, we have presented the energy landscape of the perovskite with a variation in the precursor stoichiometry, since the energy levels are indeed crucial in designing any optoelectronic devices based on CsPbBr3.

Abstract: In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), macrophages are the most abundant immune cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophage infiltration is inversely proportional to prognosis and disease survival, particularly when these tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) assume an M2-like phenotype. This phenotype is determined by cues from the microenvironment, especially tumor cell-secreted molecules, and is associated with increased production of extracellular-matrix-degrading enzymes, angiogenic molecules and immunosuppressing cytokines. This study investigates, in vitro and in vivo, the relative contribution of OSCC cell-secreted transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) on the phenotype of macrophages and on macrophage-facilitated tumor invasion. TCGA database shows a positive correlation between high expression of TGFB1 and macrophage infiltrate in Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). THP-1 derived-macrophages were exposed to the secretome of two OSCC cell lines using two strategies to block the effects of neoplastic cell-secreted TGF-β: pre-treatment with a TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitor (LY364947) and antibody-mediated depletion. RT-qPCR, ELISA and flow cytometry determined macrophage phenotype after exposure to conditioned medium (CM) from H-314 (TGF-βhigh) or SCC-9 (TGF-βlow) cell lines. The influence of TGF-β on macrophage-mediated tumor cell invasion (myogel and CAM assays) and chemotaxis (Boyden chamber) was assessed using co-cultures of macrophages and OSCC cells in which macrophages were pre-conditioned with the secretome of OSCC cells in the presence and absence of LY364947. Blocking the effects of TGF-β skewed macrophages to the M1 end of the phenotype by differential effects depending on the strategy for inhibiting the influence of TGF-β and on the neoplastic cell secretome. In vitro and in vivo invasion of H-314 cell line was reduced by inhibiting TGFBR1 signaling in macrophages, whereas SCC-9 cell invasion was not affected. SCC-9/macrophage reciprocal chemotaxis were enhanced by inhibiting TGFBR1 signaling in macrophages, whereas only macrophage chemotaxis to H314 products was inhibited by inhibiting TGFBR1. In summary, blocking the effects of OSCC cell-secreted TGF-β in macrophages attenuates M2-like phenotypical traits of macrophages and can impact invasion and chemotaxis of tumor cells differentially.

Abstract: Introduction
Hematologic abnormalities are frequent among persons living with HIV (PLWH). The bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy (BMB) are commonly performed in the diagnostic approach of patients with unexplained cytopenias. Changes in antiretrovirals, supportive therapy and increased life expectancy have modified the distribution and etiology of cytopenias, questioning their use. Our aim was to analyze the diagnostic yield of BMA, BMB and marrow cultures for the evaluation of cytopenias in PLWH.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort of ≥ 18-year-old PLWH undergoing bone marrow assessment (MA) for the evaluation of cytopenias between January 2002 and December 2015.
Results
A total of 236 cytopenic events were analyzed, 47.9% being PLWH who had a longstanding diagnosis (≥ 1 year). Adherence to antiretrovirals was 63.5%. Anemia was seen in 91.9% and pancytopenia in 39%. Common presentations included fever (52.1%), weight loss (42.8%) and adenopathies (28.8%). Median days from detection to MA was 5 (0 – 63 days). Most common etiologies were non-HIV infectious diseases (31.4%) and benign/malignant hematologic diseases (26.3%). The diagnostic yield was 16.1% for BMA, 20.3% for BMB, 30.5% for both and 35.6% when cultures were added. Patients most likely to have conclusive MA were those with moderate/severe thrombocytopenia (p = 0.007). Fever, splenomegaly, and low CD4+ counts were associated with infectious etiologies, while hematologic diagnoses were related to the presence of adenopathies.
Conclusion
As a minimally invasive intervention, the MA has a high yield for identifying the etiology of cytopenic events in PLWH, being conclusive in one in three patients. Early performance could lead to prompt diagnosis and timely therapy initiation.

Abstract: Antimony selenosulfide, Sb2(S, Se)3, is regarded as an appropriate absorber to be utilized in terrestrial single junction solar cell applications thanks to the tunability of its bandgap energy which could be adjusted around 1.3 eV. To enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2(S, Se)3-based single junction solar cell, we propose some design recommendations by using device simulation. First, in order to validate the simulation model, a calibration step is accomplished by comparing the numerical simulation results with those of a fabricated cell structure consisting of Au/Sb2(S, Se)3/CdS/ITO. The designed cell is formed without an organic hole transport layer (HTL) which, generally, harmfully affects the cell by causing stability issues. Next, we investigate the impact of the conduction band offset (CBO) between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the Sb2(S, Se)3 absorber utilizing the bandgap tunable material Cd1-xZnxS to achieve the optimum CBO. Various key design parameters for the presented cell such as the back contact work function as well as absorber thickness and doping concentration are also inspected. It is found that the most crucial parameter that affects the cell performance is the CBO which could be adjusted by modifying the Zn fraction in the ternary compound Cd1-xZnxS. Moreover, a study on the impact of the interface and bulk defects on device performance is carried out. The simulations, conducted in this study, are accomplished by SCAPS-1D simulator at 300 K temperature and under AM1.5G illumination.

Abstract: In this work we present a novel approach to reduce inhomogeneity of resistivity for n-type phosphorus-doped directionally solidified silicon ingots by using complex arrangements on influencing dopant transport during growth process, which involves adjustments of melt flow and gas transport. In order to obtain more uniform resistivity profile over ingot's height, different process conditions were tested on G1-sized (22 × 22 × 12 cm3) n-type directionally solidified ingots, including altering of ambient gas pressure, enhanced melt mixing with travelling magnetic fields and variations of argon flow above the melt. The quality of ingots was characterised in terms of electrical resistivity and minority carrier lifetime, as well as the presence of impurities and inclusions. The influence of process parameters on material quality will be discussed. It will be shown that a complex approach to melt stirring and gas transport is an effective way to control resistivity distribution along the height of phosphorus-doped multicrystalline ingots, which makes it possible to provide n-type ingots with resistivity profiles comparable to p-type boron-doped ones.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel fracture mechanics test-setup was developed, implemented and applied for assessment of the fatigue delamination behavior of glass/encapsulant laminates under superimposed mechanical stresses and environmental influences. Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens with glass substrates were prepared using ethylene vinyl-acetate copolymer (EVA) or polyolefin elastomer (POE) encapsulants. Displacement-controlled fatigue tests were conducted at 80 °C under dry (5% rh) and humid (80% rh) conditions. The damage zone ahead of the delamination crack tip was monitored with a topside mounted camera system. A superior delamination resistance of POE based double glass laminates was ascertained. Under less service-relevant, hot-dry conditions, the glass laminates exhibited a mm-sized damage process zone ahead of the crack tip, in which void nucleation and fibril formation took place. While the POE laminate failed also in a cohesive manner within the encapsulant at 80 °C and 80% rh (i.e., hot-humid), the crack was propagating in the glass/EVA laminate close to the interface in a brittle manner. Local ageing mechanisms were confirmed for the fractured EVA laminates by XPS. The superposition of mechanical and thermal stresses along with humidity resulted in sodium ion migration presumably promoting deacetylation of EVA. Interestingly, the analyzed degradation products were in good agreement with data obtained for damp heat aged glass/foil PV modules characterized subsequently by monotonic delamination testing. The main advantage of the novel environmental fracture mechanics methodology is the high acceleration factor (50 to 100x faster) compared to conventional ageing and delamination testing of PV modules.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have drawn significant attention due to their excellent photovoltaic characteristics. Upconversion luminescence material modification is a good strategy to extend the device response to the near-infrared region, which can further increase device efficiency. By adding NaGdF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanorods into chlorobenzene as an additive in the antisolvent to modify the perovskite layer, we found that upconversion luminescence nanoparticles can effectively improve the perovskite solar cell performance. However, unexpectedly, the photocurrent contributed by the infrared part is lower. The efficiency increase of perovskite solar cells is contributed by defect passivation. Further research shows that nanoparticles can effectively fill the holes and gaps at the grain boundaries, eliminate surface defects of the perovskite, and modify the perovskite film, which reduces carrier recombination and effectively improves the device's performance. Finally, the power conversion efficiency of the champion device can reach 21.1%. This research demonstrates the function of upconversion luminescence nanoparticles in PSCs and provides a simple way to improve the device's efficiency.

Abstract: Objectives
Investigate the prevalence of Rh and the K antigens and their phenotypes in the red blood cells of blood donors in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Methods
This is a retrospective study. The five principal Rh antigens (D, C, c, E, e) and the Kell antigen from the Kell blood group were tested in 4,675 random samples collected from four blood bank centers in Riyadh. Data were collected for seven weeks (from January 4, 2019 to February 28, 2019). Antigens were tested using the TANGO Optimo system.
Results
We found that approximately 86% of the donors had the D antigen, 66% had C, 78% had c, 26% had E, 97% had e and 14% had K. The most common Rh phenotypes were R1r (31%) and R1R1 (22%).
Conclusion
The differences in the results between the study population and other populations, such as Caucasian, Indian and African populations indicate the importance of establishing a population-specific database.

Abstract: Introduction
The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents a group of hematopoietic neoplasms that is characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, cytopenia and abnormal cellular maturation. Red cell distribution width (RDW) refers to the variation degree of erythrocyte size and it is a reflection of anisocytosis. Higher values have been linked to adverse outcomes, such as increased mortality, vascular events, kidney and liver disease and demonstrated to harbor poor prognosis in solid and hematological malignancies. The RDW value can be used as a contributing parameter for MDS diagnosis, as well as its prognosis. In this study, we essentially aimed to demonstrate the correlation between the RDW and MDS prognostic indexes.
Materials and methods
Ninety-four MDS patients at the Aydın Adnan Menderes University Hematology Division were included in the study. The correlations between the RDW and laboratory values (either lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, globulin or ferritin) and the RDW prognostic scoring indexes (IPSS, WPSS, IPSS-R and LR-PSS) were investigated. The PASW for Windows, version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), was used for statistical assessment. A p-value below 0.05 was the cut-off for the statistical significance.
Results
The mean age of all the patients was 73 ± 10 years. Patients were observed for 41.88 ± 25 months. The mean RDW value for all cases was 15.5 ± 2.39. We found a statistically significant difference of survival between RDW values below and above 15.5% (p = 0.016). A significant difference was also observed according to the prognostic scoring indexes (see below).
Conclusion
An increase in RDW is probably related to dysplasia in the MDS and this constitutes a possible explanation for the poor outcome. Prognostic indexes might incorporate the RDW as a parameter in the future.

Abstract: Low emissivity (low-e) coatings minimise heat transmittance through the coating and emission of infrared light from hot surfaces. They are used in space applications to reduce overheating of the spacecraft, in architectural applications and automotive windows to block heat from entering a building or vehicle. Typically, in window applications the low-e coatings consist of a multilayer coating, which combine metallic films (approx. 10 nm); responsible for the heat reflection and dielectric films (approx. 40 nm); used to protect the metallic films and enhance their visible transmittance. Commercially available low-e coatings can contain more than 15 layers, with Ag typically used as the metallic layer. However, Ag is soft and tends to tarnish, making Ag-based low-e coatings vulnerable to degradation when exposed to environmental conditions. In this study we demonstrated environmentally durable low-e coatings based on Ag–Cu alloyed thin films. The thin film alloys showed higher level of scratch resistance than conventional pure Ag coatings with high level of transmittance of visible light. The multilayer coating consisting of a dielectric film, metal alloy film and a protective coating was demonstrated as robust, long-life, first surface low-e coating.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a single point mutation in the β-globin chain of the hemoglobin. It has been recognized by the World Health Organization as a public health priority since 2006.
Methods
The Scopus database was used in this study with the search descriptors: “sickle cell” and “sickle cell disease”. We applied common bibliometric indicators to evaluate the trend in scientific literature in sickle cell disease research.
Results
We retrieved a total of 19,921 pieces of scientific literature in the repertoire from 1997 to 2017. The Price law was fulfilled in the trend of production of scientific literature on SCD as the growth of scientific literature was more exponential (r=0.9751; r2=0.9509) than linear (r=0.9721; r2=0.9449). We observed a duplication time of 4.52 years. The Bradford core was made up of 69 journals with Blood at the top, publishing the greatest number of articles. The most productive institutions were mostly United States agencies and hospitals. The United States was the most productive country. The National Institute of Health was the most productive institution and also had the highest number of citations. Vichinsky E was the most productive author, while the most cited article was published by Circulation.
Conclusion
The growth of scientific literature in Sickle cell disease was found to be high. However, the exponential growth trend shows a “yet-to-be-explored” area of research. This study will be useful for physicians, researchers, research funders and policy-cum-decision makers.

Abstract: Introduction
Audit and education are essential pre-requisites in the review and update of blood transfusion practices. Although standard guidelines on appropriate utilization of blood components exists, erroneous use of blood components with no justification still continues. This study evaluates appropriateness of blood transfusion in obstetric settings and identifies key areas requiring educational intervention to improve blood transfusion practice toward the evidence-based at our hospital.
Method
This was a prospective observational study on the analysis of blood transfusion requisition forms for obstetric patients before and after educational intervention, performed in two Phases from September 2011 to August 2012 and October 2012 to September 2013. The appropriateness of blood utilization was assessed against the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Guidelines for blood transfusion and Green-Top Guideline no. 47. Data required for the study were obtained from department records and statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS, version 20 (IBM, USA).
Results
The total transfusion episodes were 214 in 51 patients and 181 in 43 patients in Phases 1 and 2, respectively. Fresh frozen plasma was the most misused blood component, next to whole blood in Phase 1. However, appropriate utilization of components, including cryoprecipitate (6.6%), reduction in whole blood (34.5–14.4%) and single unit transfusion (23.3–18.2%) were observed in Phase 2. Inappropriate use of blood components, namely, packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma dropped significantly (p<0.05) from 29.7% to 13.1% and 45.1% to 22.5%, respectively, with the exclusion of platelet concentrate (33.3–20.6%, p-value 0.414).
Conclusion
Audit and targeted education helped in optimizing transfusion practices in the obstetric setting.

Abstract: Chromothripsis is a unique form of genome instability characterized by tens to hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks on one or very few chromosomes, followed by error-prone repair. The derivative chromosome(s) display massive rearrangements, which lead to the loss of tumor suppressor function and to the activation of oncogenes. Chromothripsis plays a major role in cancer as well as in other conditions, such as congenital diseases. In this review, we discuss the repair processes involved in the rejoining of the chromosome fragments, the role of DNA repair and checkpoint defects as a cause for chromothripsis as well as DNA repair defects resulting from chromothripsis. Finally, we consider clinical implications and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities that could be utilized to eliminate tumor cells with chromothripsis.

Abstract: Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) suppresses T effector functions by inhibiting signaling downstream of the T cell receptor and helping tumor cells escape the immune response. However, the effect and mechanism of cell-intrinsic PD-1 in cancer cells are still unknown. Here, we found that PD-1 is aberrantly upregulated in TNBC patients and cell lines. Cell-intrinsic PD-1 in TNBC cells significantly facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Further studies indicated that PD-1 effect on TNBC cell growth depends on the cell-intrinsic-PD-1/PD-L1 pathway independent of adaptive immunity. In addition, we further found that the activation of cell-intrinsic PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in TNBC cells is regulated by the gene expression regulator YB-1. Mechanistically, the results of protein degradation analysis, mRNA translationally active analysis, CLICK chemistry and L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) incorporation assays, immunoprecipitation assay and Dual-Luciferase reporter assay showed that YB-1 promotes PD-1 expression through the translational activation pathway. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that silencing YB-1 expression in TNBC cells inhibits cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. However, this inhibition can be rescued by simultaneous exogenous expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins. In conclusion, our results identify TNBC cell-intrinsic functions of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in tumor growth and metastasis; and revealed PD-1/PD-L1 is a critical effector of YB-1-mediated TNBC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: LncRNA surfactant associated 1 (SFTA1P) exhibits low expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues as compared with that in adjacent tissues, and may play a suppressing role in NSCLC. However, the effect and mechanism of SFTA1P on the metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remain undefined, which are thus investigated in this research. Herein, potential impacts of SFTA1P on LUAD were determined through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). After knockdown/overexpression of SFTA1P, the metastatic ability of LUAD cells was evaluated by molecular biology experiments (cell counting kit-8 assay, scratch test, Transwell assay and Western blot). The effect of SFTA1P on Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear translocation was assessed by Western blot. Hypoxia-induced exosomes were extracted for LUAD metastasis analysis. The targeting relationship of SFTA1P/miR-4766–5p/large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and molecular biology experiments. Xenograft and lung metastasis models were constructed for in vivo validation. SFTA1P was lowly expressed in LUAD, which was associated with the poor prognosis of patients with LUAD. Up-regulated SFTA1P prevented the metastasis of LUAD cells and the nuclear translocation of YAP. Hypoxia-induced exosomes stimulated LUAD cell metastasis, but inhibited the SFTA1P and LATS1/YAP axes. MiR-4766–5p acted as an intermediate "bridge" for SFTA1P to regulate LATS1. SFTA1P repressed xenograft growth and LUAD cell metastasis. To sum up, SFTA1P activates hypoxic exosome-delivered miR-4766–5p through modulating LATS1/YAP pathway, thereby suppressing LUAD cell metastasis, which may serve as a suitable target for the LUAD therapy.

Abstract: Background
This study aims to validate the single-platform method for enumeration of CD34+ cells, by comparing the performance of two different commercial kits, as well as to evaluate the efficiency of the AccuriTM C6 cytometer in providing direct counts of absolute cell numbers.
Method
We evaluated 20 samples from umbilical cord blood (UCB), comparing the two different methodologies for enumeration of CD34+ cells: single and dual-platform. For the assessment of the single-platform, Procount and SCE kits were used, both of which use fluorescent beads as a counting reference to obtain absolute CD34+ cells numbers. Moreover, after the acquisition of samples in flow cytometer AccuriTM C6, following the protocol established for each kit, the number of CD34+ cells was recalculated, considering the cell count provided by the AccuriTM C6.
Main Results
In our analysis, the results showed a strong correlation between the number of CD34+ cells/μL (r2=0.77) when comparing the SCE kit and the current dual-platform method. On the other hand, the comparison between Procount kit and dual-platform results showed a moderate correlation for the number of CD34+/μL cells (r2=0.64).
Conclusion
Our results showed that the AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer can be used safely, applying both the dual and single platform analysis strategy. Considering the ISHAGE protocol-based single-platform approach, as the most appropriate methodology for CD34+ cells enumeration, our results demonstrated that the SCE kit has great potential for national standardization of UCB samples analysis methodology.

Abstract: Experimental investigation of a hybrid-solar desalination system consisting of a humidiﬁcation–dehumidiﬁcation unit and a solar distiller unit. At El Mahalah city- Egypt in climatic conditions, experimental work was performed under real thermal conditions in September 2021. A new design of helical humidifier and multi-section solar distiller has been tested. There is good agreement between the predicted and measured changes in water production and performance parameters. According to testing and operating parameters, the system's highest productivity was 6.7 kg/m2 per day at a production cost of 10.4 $/m3. System performance was tested and represented by system efficiency, humidifier efficiency, and gain output ratio (GOR). The system efficiency, humidifier efficiency, maximum gain output ratio, and exergy efficiency reached 95%, 98%, 1.65, and 7.2%, respectively. The proposed hybrid desalination system gives an adequate operational compatibility between the HDH method and solar energy.

Abstract: PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been widely applied in infrared (IR) solar cells, as they can broaden the photon conversion region beyond 1100 nm, which can help promote an extra 6% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) as bottom subcells for silicon solar cell. Although halide liquid exchange is the dominant passivation strategy for CQDs, it is difficult to passivate all the surface defects, especially for IR CQD, which leaves the main limitation for improving PCE. Here, a facile in-situ solution-processed patch-passivation strategy was first proposed for developing efficient PbS CQD IR solar cells. A typical Lewis base triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) was added to I−/Br− capped PbS CQDs, aiming at passivation with uncoordinated Pb2+ as a “patch-ligand”. As a result, the phosphorus oxygen bond coordination could help suppress the non-radiative recombination in CQD films. The TPPO-passivated devices delivered an IR PCE as high as 1.36% under silicon-filtered AM 1.5G, along with a promising open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44 V, both of which are the highest among other single-junction solar cells with a band gap of ∼0.95 eV. The significant VOC and fill factor (FF) enhancement can be attributed to the decrease in defect density and faster charge transport in TPPO-passivated devices.

Abstract: For measuring the current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of busbarless solar cells, there is a certain degree of freedom in the choice of the contacting configuration as none has been defined as standard yet. This leads to the question of how the energy conversion efficiency of a busbarless solar cell should be specified when there are different measured values for it and poses the risk of misinterpreting cell measurements: Designing the measurement system for highest cell efficiencies for example may be tempting but can lead to cell results disassociated from later module performance and reduced cell-to-module power factors. The loss in module efficiency can thereby significantly exceed 5 %rel. It is therefore recommended to always adapt the contacting system to the module interconnection to yield meaningful I–V results in cell measurements. As a remedy for non-adapted measurement conditions, it is shown that I–V results can be converted from various cell measurement configurations to the module configuration. An analytical approach for the conversion of I–V results between measurement systems with different numbers of current contact bars as well as different shading properties is proposed. The approach is validated experimentally on busbarless cells over a large grid resistivity range. For three measurement systems with very different contacting schemes, the differences in fill factor and efficiency between the systems before correction clearly exceeded 10 %rel for high grid resistivities. After correction, good agreement in I–V characteristics within typical measurement uncertainties were shown. Limitations to the analytical approach associated with finger interruptions are identified and discussed.

Abstract: Corrosion is one of the main end-of-life degradation and failure modes in photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, it is a gradual process and can take many years to become a major risk factor because of the slow accumulation of water and acetic acid (from encapsulant ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) degradation). In this work, an accelerated aging test for acetic acid corrosion was developed to probe wear-out and end-of-life behavior and facilitate screening of new cell, passivation, metallization, and interconnection technologies. In the tests, the top glass and EVA layers were removed from PV modules to expose the solar cells and interconnects. These “opened” modules were then placed in acid baths under varying conditions, including acid concentration, temperature, and electrical bias. Three cell technologies were tested, including Al-back surface field (BSF), passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC), and silicon heterojunction (SHJ). For all conditions, the presence of acid accelerated module power loss compared to control tests with water baths. Increased temperature accelerated the rate of degradation by several times. Application of electrical bias led to an initial drop in short circuit current, but these modules eventually outperformed the non-biased modules. In all tests, lead oxides were the primary degradation products detected, and found to accumulate mostly along the printed metallization, especially in proximity to the busbar. SHJ cells with a silver paste-based interconnection outperformed Al-BSF and PERC cells with a solder-based interconnection. The accelerated corrosion test methods can be optimized to match corrosion behavior observed in field modules with greater precision and shorter times than standard damp heat tests, and is especially useful to assess the long-term durability of the continuously increasing variety of corrosion sensitive PV materials and components.

Abstract: A significant deal of interest has been generated in heterojunctions made of 2D Bi-Chalcogenides and semiconducting materials due to the wide range of unique properties and functionalities that they exhibit. In this work RF magnetron sputtering technique was used to fabricate the high-quality n-Bi2Se3/p-Si heterojunction device. The structural properties of the grown Bi2Se3 thin films were examined by XRD, SEM, Raman and Energy dispersive spectroscopy. The current-voltage (I–V) characteristic revealed the development of effective p-n junction with a greatest rectification ratio (RR) of 724 and significant figure of merit (FOM) of 1.11. A visible to near-infrared photodetector was successfully constructed using n-Bi2Se3/p-Si heterostructure exhibiting a strong response to 1100 nm irradiance and demonstrated outstanding photo-responsivity of 43.3 A/W, an excellent detectivity of 2.08 × 1012 Jones and convincing photoconductive gain of 48.71. The fabricated n-Bi2Se3/p-Si heterojunction offers inexpensive optical detection, high performance broadband detector and tremendous potential for superior electrical and optoelectronic applications due to its convenient device fabrication and compatibility with silicon technology.

Abstract: Surface-fluorinated TiO2 nanocrystal (NC) films have been obtained on FTO substrates by the one-pot solvothermal reaction. It is found that the fluorine anions play a critical role in generating oxygen vacancies, and triggering the self-assembly of the NCs to form porous structures as well as modulating the NC sizes. Meanwhile, pristine TiO2 films show simultaneous electrochromic regulation behavior in the near-infrared and visible regions under electrochemical bias, which reveals that the surface-fluorinated TiO2 films demonstrate selective and independent modulation in the two regions with high optical modulation (77.5% at 700 nm and 62.5% at 1300 nm); unprecedentedly fast electrochromic response (coloring time of 12.8 s at 700 nm and 10.2 s at 1300 nm; bleaching time of 4.3 s at 700 nm and 4.8 s at 1300 nm); and superior cycling stability, respectively. The films also exhibit three typical energy efficient working modes and promising energy storage characteristics. In addition, the electrochromic reaction kinetics is scrutinized, and it is investigated that the effect of oxygen vacancies is of importance to realize NIR selective modulation. The present work may prove to provide an alternative approach for designing high performance TiO2-based single-component dual-band energy efficient electrochromic devices.
