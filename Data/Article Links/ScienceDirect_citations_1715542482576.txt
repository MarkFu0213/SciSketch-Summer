Abstract: Noise is present in nature, and it affects the nervous and cardiovascular system. Noise added to stimuli may change the performance of excitable cells. In this paper, we study the effect of noise on the two main heart cell types: pacemaker and myocardial cells. This study investigates whether noise can induce changes in calcium dynamics on the two main heart cell types: pacemaker and myocardial cells, when stimuli with periodic electrical signals are disturbed by Gaussian white noise. Calcium dynamic parameters were obtained using imaging signals. Our results show that low intensities of noise favor amplitude and raise rate calcium dynamics, although our results show that the pacemaker cells are not affected by a noisy stimulus. Altogether, these findings suggest that noise plays a key role in calcium dynamics.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrosing interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options and a median survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Dysregulated epithelial regeneration is key event involved in initiating and sustaining IPF. The type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) play a crucial role for epithelial regeneration and stabilisation of alveoli. Loss of cell apical-basal polarity contributes to fibrosis. AECII has apical-basal polarity, but it is poorly understood whether AECII apical-basal polarity loss is involved in fibrosis. Bleomycin is a traditional inducer of pulmonary fibrosis. Here firstly we observed that bleomycin induced apical-basal polarity loss in cultured AECIIs. Next, cell polarity proteins lethal (2) giant larvae 1 (Lgl1), PAR-3A, aPKC and PAR-6B were investigated. We found bleomycin induced increases of Lgl1 protein and decreases of PAR-3A protein, and bleomycin-induced PAR-3A depression was mediated by increased-Lgl1. Then Lgl1 siRNA was transfected into AECIIs. Lgl1 siRNA prevented apical-basal polarity loss in bleomycin-treated AECIIs. At last, Lgl1-conditional knockout mice were applied in making animal models. Bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, but this was attenuated in Lgl1-conditional knockout mice. Together, these data indicated that bleomycin mediated AECII apical-basal polarity loss which contributed to experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Inhibition of Lgl1 should be a potential therapeutic strategy for the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Enteroviruses are suspected to contribute to insulin-producing β cell loss and hyperglycemia-induced diabetes. However, mechanisms are not fully defined. Here, we show that coxsackievirus B type 4 (CVB4) infection in human islet-engrafted mice and in rat insulinoma cells displays loss of unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) and PDX1, affecting β cell function and identity. Genetic URI ablation in the mouse pancreas causes PDX1 depletion in β cells. Importantly, diabetic PDX1 heterozygous mice overexpressing URI in β cells are more glucose tolerant. Mechanistically, URI loss triggers estrogen receptor nuclear translocation leading to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression, which induces Pdx1 promoter hypermethylation and silencing. Consequently, demethylating agent procainamide-mediated DNMT1 inhibition reinstates PDX1 expression and protects against diabetes in pancreatic URI-depleted mice . Finally, the β cells of human diabetes patients show correlations between viral protein 1 and URI, PDX1, and DNMT1 levels. URI and DNMT1 expression and PDX1 silencing provide a causal link between enterovirus infection and diabetes.

Abstract: Functional imaging of the intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i using fluorescent indicators is a powerful and frequently applied method for assessing various biological questions in vitro, including ion channel function and intracellular signaling in homeostasis and disease. In functional [Ca2+]i imaging experiments, the fluorescence intensity of single cells is typically recorded during application of a chemical stimulus, i.e. by exchange of modified extracellular media, exposure to drugs and/or ligands. The concomitant mechanical perturbation caused by the perfusion of different solution during experimentation severely hinders calcium imaging in non-adherent cells, including peripheral immune cells, as cells in suspension are dislocated by turbulent flow during chemical stimulation. The quantitative analysis, involving time-courses of intracellular fluorescence signal changes, necessitates cells to remain at the same position throughout the experiment. To prevent dislocation of cells during solution exchange, and to enable imaging as well as analysis of Ca2+ responses in immune cells, a gelatin-based method for immobilization of non-adherent cells was developed. Gelatin has been a long-serving material for cell immobilization, e.g. in 3D bio-printing of cells and has thus, also been employed in the context of this study. To demonstrate the applicability of the established method for functional Ca2+ imaging in gelatin-immobilized suspension cells, a proof-of-concept study was conducted using human peripheral blood model cell lines (Jurkat/T-lymphocytes and THP-1/monocytes), Ca2+ indicators (Fluo-4 and Fura-2) and two different fluorescence microscopy rigs. The data presented that the established methodology is applicable for studying Ca2+ signaling by in vitro high-content functional imaging of [Ca2+]i in suspension cells, including but not restricted to human immune cells.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) are potential biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. We employ TEP-derived RNA panels, determined by swarm intelligence, to detect and monitor glioblastoma. We assessed specificity by comparing the spliced RNA profile of TEPs from glioblastoma patients with multiple sclerosis and brain metastasis patients (validation series, n = 157; accuracy, 80%; AUC, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74–0.89; p < 0.001]). Second, analysis of patients with glioblastoma versus asymptomatic healthy controls in an independent validation series (n = 347) provided a detection accuracy of 95% and AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99; p < 0.001). Finally, we developed the digitalSWARM algorithm to improve monitoring of glioblastoma progression and demonstrate that the TEP tumor scores of individual glioblastoma patients represent tumor behavior and could be used to distinguish false positive progression from true progression (validation series, n = 20; accuracy, 85%; AUC, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.70–1.00; p < 0.012]). In conclusion, TEPs have potential as a minimally invasive biosource for blood-based diagnostics and monitoring of glioblastoma patients.

Abstract: Directed cardiomyogenesis from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has been greatly improved in the last decade but directed differentiation to pacemaking cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of NODAL signaling by a specific NODAL inhibitor (SB431542) in the cardiac mesoderm differentiation stage downregulated PITX2c, a transcription factor that is known to inhibit the formation of the sinoatrial node in the left atrium during cardiac development. The resulting hiPSC-CMs were smaller in cell size, expressed higher pro-pacemaking transcription factors, TBX3 and TBX18, and exhibited pacemaking-like electrophysiological characteristics compared to control hiPSC-CMs differentiated from established Wnt-based protocol. The pacemaker-like subtype increased up to 2.4-fold in hiPSC-CMs differentiated with the addition of SB431542 relative to the control. Hence, Nodal inhibition in the cardiac mesoderm stage promoted pacemaker-like CM differentiation from hiPSCs. Improving the yield of human pacemaker-like CMs is a critical first step in the development of functional human cell-based biopacemakers.

Abstract: Induced mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are attractive cells for regenerative medicine. However, the transcriptome of iMSCs and signature genes that can distinguish MSCs from fibroblasts and other cell types are rarely explored. In this study, we reported an optimized feeder-free method for the generation of iMSCs from human pluripotent stem cells. These iMSCs display a typical MSC morphology, express classic MSC markers (CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166), are negative for lymphocyte markers (CD11b, CD14, CD31, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR), and are potent for osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Using genome-wide transcriptome profiling, we created an easily accessible transcriptome reference for the process of differentiating PSCs into iMSCs. The iMSC transcriptome reference revealed clear patterns in the silencing of pluripotency genes, activation of lineage commitment genes, and activation of mesenchymal genes during iMSC generation. All previously known positive and negative markers for MSCs were confirmed by our iMSC transcriptomic reference, and most importantly, gene classification and time course analysis identified 52 genes including FN1, TGFB1, TAGLN and SERPINE1, which showed significantly higher expression in MSCs (over 3 folds) than fibroblasts and other cell types. Taken together, these results provide a useful method and important resources for developing and understanding iMSCs in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Fatty acid–binding proteins (FABPs) are lipid chaperones assisting in the trafficking of long-chain fatty acids with functions in various cell compartments, including oxidation, signaling, gene-transcription regulation, and storage. The various known FABP isoforms display distinctive tissue distribution, but some are active in more than one tissue. Quantitative and/or qualitative changes of FABPs are associated with pathological conditions. Increased circulating levels of FABPs are biomarkers of disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Deregulated expression and malfunction of FABPs can result from genetic alterations or posttranslational modifications and can be pathogenic. We have assembled the disorders with abnormal FABPs as chaperonopathies in a distinct nosological entity. This entity is similar but separate from that encompassing the chaperonopathies pertaining to protein chaperones. In this review, we discuss the role of FABPs in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, cancer, and neurological diseases. We highlight the opportunities for improving diagnosis and treatment that open by encompassing all these pathological conditions within of a coherent nosological group, focusing on abnormal lipid chaperones as biomarkers of disease and etiological-pathogenic factors.

Abstract: Myst family genes encode lysine acetyltransferases that mainly mediate histone acetylation to control transcription, DNA replication and DNA damage response. They form tetrameric complexes with PHD-finger proteins (Brpfs or Jades) and small non-catalytic subunits Ing4/5 and Meaf6. Although all the components of the complex are well-conserved from yeast to mammals, the function of Meaf6 and its homologs has not been elucidated in any species. Here we revealed the role of Meaf6 utilizing inducible Meaf6 KO ES cells. By elimination of Meaf6, proliferation ceased although histone acetylations were largely unaffected. In the absence of Meaf6, one of the Myst family members Myst2/Kat7 increased the ability to interact with PHD-finger proteins. This study is the first indication of the function of Meaf6, which shows it is not essential for HAT activity but modulates the assembly of the Kat7 complex.

Abstract: In the present study, we have explored the prognostic value of the Phosphofructokinase Platelet-type (PFKP) expression and its therapeutic relevance in metastatic breast cancer. PFKP immunohistochemistry was performed on Invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs; n = 87) of breast, and its association with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. Using online meta-analysis tools, PFKP's prognostic value was investigated in overall breast cancer as well as in triple negative subtype (TNBCs). For in vitro analysis, MDA-MB-231 cells model was used in order to elucidate mechanisms behind PFKP regulated glycolysis and its impact on cancer cell physiology. Therapeutic relevance of PFKP was further evaluated using PFKP siRNA and Quercetin. PFKP protein expression was found to be positively associated with nodal invasion (p = 0.009), receptor (ER & PR) negative status (p = 0.005 & p = 0.028) and reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients (p = 0.014). In MDA-MB-231 cells, quercetin treatment impaired PFKP-LDHA signaling axis thereby inhibiting aerobic glycolysis mediated increased migration of cancer cells. Our present study demonstrates that elevated PFKP levels are associated with basal cells/TNBC subtypes and might serve as prognostic indicator for TNBC patients. Ability of quercetin to inhibit aerobic glycolysis, cell migration and clonogenic potential of malignant breast cancer cells advocates possibility of quercetin in aggressive breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system is becoming a widely used method for rapid and reversible degradation of target proteins. This system has been successfully used to study gene and protein functions in eukaryotic cells and common model organisms, such as nematode and fruit fly. To date, applications of the AID system in mammalian stem cell research are limited. Furthermore, standard mouse models harboring the AID system have not been established. Here we have explored the utility of the H11 safe-harbor locus for integration of the TIR1 transgene, an essential component of auxin-based protein degradation system. We have shown that the H11 locus can support constitutive and conditional TIR1 expression in mouse and human embryonic stem cells, as well as in mice. We demonstrate that the AID system can be successfully employed for rapid degradation of stable proteins in embryonic stem cells, which is crucial for investigation of protein functions in quickly changing environments, such as stem cell proliferation and differentiation. As embryonic stem cells possess unlimited proliferative capacity, differentiation potential, and can mimic organ development, we believe that these research tools will be an applicable resource to a broad scientific audience.

Abstract: Background
Apoptin can specifically kill cancer cells but has no toxicity to normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) acts as a tumor-specific promoter, triggering certain genes to replicate or express only in tumor cells, conferring specific replication and killing abilities. This study aimed at investigating the anticancer potential of the recombinant adenovirus Ad-apoptin-hTERTp-E1a (Ad-VT) in ovarian cancer treatment.
Methods
Crystal Violet staining and WST-1 assays were used to analyze the inhibitory effect of Ad-VT on ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Ad-VT-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, was detected using Hoechst, Annexin V-FITC/PI, JC-1 staining. Cell migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells were detected using cell-scratch and Transwell assays. The pGL4.51 plasmid was used to transfect and to generate SKOV3-LUC cells, that stably express luciferase. The in vivo tumor inhibition effect of Ad-VT was subsequently confirmed using a tumor-bearing nude mouse model.
Results
Ad-VT had a strong apoptosis-inducing effect on SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 cells, that was mainly mediated through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The Ad-VT could significantly increase the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. The Ad-VT also can inhibit tumor growth and reduce toxicity in vivo.
Conclusions
The recombinant adenovirus, comprising the apoptin protein and the hTERTp promoter, was able to inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer cells and promote their apoptosis.

Abstract: High glucose (HG)-induced oxidative stress contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Pleckstrin homology domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) has emerged as a key regulator of oxidative stress implicated in various pathological processes. However, whether PHLPP1 participates in the regulation of HG-induced oxidative stress injury of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in diabetic retinopathy is undetermined. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential role and molecular mechanism of PHLPP1 in regulating HG-induced injury of RGCs. Our data showed that PHLPP1 expression was markedly elevated in RGCs from diabetic rats and HG-exposed RGCs. Our functional assay elucidated that knockdown of PHLPP1 improved cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HG-exposed RGCs. Additionally, upregulation of PHLPP1 lowered cell viability and increased cell apoptosis and ROS production in HG-exposed RGCs. Mechanistically, knockdown of PHLPP1 resulted in an increase in nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear expression and Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated transcription associated with upregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β significantly reversed the suppressive effect of PHLPP1 overexpression on Nrf2/ARE activation. Notably, the protective effect of PHLPP1 knockdown on HG-induced injury in RGCs was markedly abolished by Nrf2 inhibition. In conclusion, Our findings demonstrate that downregulation of PHLPP1 activates Nrf2/ARE signaling to protect RGCs from HG-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. This study indicates a potential role of PHLPP1 in regulating HG-induced injury of RGCs during the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Abstract: Background
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are histone modifiers which control gene expression by assembling into large repressive complexes termed - Polycomb repressive complex (PRC); RING1B, core catalytic subunit of PRC1 that performs H2AK119 monoubiquitination leading to gene repression. The role of PRC1 complex during early neural specification in humans is unclear; we have tried to uncover the role of PRC1 in neuronal differentiation using human pluripotent stem cells as an in vitro model.
Results
We differentiated both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) towards neural progenitor stage evident from the expression of NESTIN, TUJ1, NCAD, and PAX6. When we checked the total expression of RING1B and BMI1, we saw that they were significantly upregulated in differentiated neural progenitors compared to undifferentiated cells. Further, we used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled with qPCR to determine the localization of RING1B, and the repressive histone modification H2AK119ub1 at the promoters of neuronal specific genes. We observed that RING1B localized to and catalyzed H2AK119ub1 modification at promoters of TUJ1, NCAM, and NESTIN during early differentiation and later RING1B was lost from its promoter leading their expression; while functional RING1B persisted significantly on mature neuronal genes such as IRX3, GSX2, SOX1, NEUROD1 and FOXG1 in neural progenitors.
Conclusion
The results of our study show that PRC1 catalytic component RING1B occupies neuronal gene promoters in human pluripotent stem cells and may prevent their precocious expression. However, when neuronal inductive signals are given, RING1B is not only removed from neuronal gene promoters, but the inhibitory H2AK119ub1 modification is also lost.

Abstract: Summary
Human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) are promising cellular substrates to explore for the in situ production of new neurons for brain repair. Proof of concept for direct neuronal reprogramming of glial progenitors has been obtained in mouse models in vivo, but conversion using human cells has not yet been demonstrated. Such studies have been difficult to perform since hGPCs are born late during human fetal development, with limited accessibility for in vitro culture. In this study, we show proof of concept of hGPC conversion using fetal cells and also establish a renewable and reproducible stem cell-based hGPC system for direct neural conversion in vitro. Using this system, we have identified optimal combinations of fate determinants for the efficient dopaminergic (DA) conversion of hGPCs, thereby yielding a therapeutically relevant cell type that selectively degenerates in Parkinson's disease. The induced DA neurons show a progressive, subtype-specific phenotypic maturation and acquire functional electrophysiological properties indicative of DA phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
There is an increasing expectation that computational approaches may supplement existing human decision-making. Frontloading of models for cardiac safety prediction is no exception to this trend, and ongoing regulatory initiatives propose use of high-throughput in vitro data combined with computational models for calculating proarrhythmic risk. Evaluation of these models requires robust assessment of the outcomes. Using FDA Adverse Event Reporting System reports and electronic healthcare claims data from the Truven-MarketScan US claims database, we quantify the incidence rate of arrhythmia in patients and how this changes depending on patient characteristics. First, we propose that such datasets are a complementary resource for determining relative drug risk and assessing the performance of cardiac safety models for regulatory use. Second, the results suggest important determinants for appropriate stratification of patients and evaluation of additional drug risk in prescribing and clinical support algorithms and for precision health.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic needs therapies that are presently available and safe. We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19’s heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection’s damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin. Controlled trials of these HO-1 inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.

Abstract: The adoptive transfer of donor-derived virus-specific T cells (VSTs) is an effective treatment for infections following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Acute exercise mobilizes effector lymphocytes and VSTs to the circulation and augments the ex vivo manufacture of VSTs. This study determined if β2 adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling precipitated the VST response to acute exercise. Healthy participants (n = 12) completed 30 min of steady-state cycling exercise after ingesting a placebo, a β1 + 2 AR antagonist (nadolol) or a β1 AR antagonist (bisoprolol). Circulating VSTs to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (AdV) antigens were enumerated before and after exercise, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with viral peptides for 8 days to expand multi-VSTs. Compared with placebo, nadolol blunted the exercise-induced mobilization of CMV-VSTs (Δ VSTs/100,000 CD3+ T cells = 93 ± 104 vs. 22 ± 91 for placebo and nadolol, respectively; p = 0.036), while bisoprolol did not, despite both drugs evoking similar reductions in exercising heart rate and blood pressure. Circulating AdV and EBV VSTs (VSTs/mL blood) only increased after exercise with placebo. Although not significant, nadolol partially mitigated exercise-induced increases in multi-VST expansion, particularly in participants that demonstrated an exercise-induced increase in VST expansion. We conclude that exercise-induced enhancements in VST mobilization and expansion are at least partially β2 AR mediated, thus highlighting a role for the β2 AR in targeted therapy for the augmentation of VST immune cell therapeutics in the allogeneic adoptive transfer setting. Moreover, long-term regular exercise may provide additional viral protection in the host through frequent β2 AR-dependent mobilization and redistribution of VSTs cumulated with each bout of exercise.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptome analysis has uncovered a series of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed during cell differentiation, but how lncRNA is integrated with known transcriptional regulatory network is poorly understood. Here, we utilize human definitive endoderm differentiation as a model system and decipher the functional interaction between lncRNA and key transcriptional factor. We have identified GATA6-AS1, an lncRNA divergently transcribed from the GATA6 locus, is highly expressed during endoderm differentiation. Knockdown of GATA6-AS1 in human pluripotent stem cells has no influence on morphology and pluripotency; however, GATA6-AS1 depletion causes the deficiency of definitive endoderm differentiation. GATA6-AS1 positively regulates the expression of endoderm key factor GATA6. Further investigation shows GATA6-AS1 interacts with SMAD2/3 and activates the transcription of GATA6. In addition, overexpression of GATA6 is able to rescue the defect of endoderm differentiation due to the absence of GATA6-AS1, suggesting that GATA6 is the functional target of GATA6-AS1 during endoderm differentiation. Ultimately, our study reveals that GATA6-AS1 is necessary for human endoderm specification and reveals the underlying mechanism between GATA6-AS1 and GATA6.

Abstract: Vascular calcification (VC) is a major risk factor for increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a representative uremic toxin, is closely associated with VC in CKD patients. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) plays pivotal role in VC as a calcification inhibitor. The aim of this work was to explore whether MGP was involved in IS-induced VC. Here, we demonstrated the role of MGP in the IS-induced osteogenic differentiation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). The methods included Von Kossa staining, immunohistochemistry, Alizarin Red staining, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. MGP was decreased in calcified arteries both in CKD patients and rats. In vitro, IS suppressed MGP expression in HASMCs by activating ROS/NF-κB signaling in parallel with osteogenic differentiation, which was mitigated by inhibiting ROS and NF-κB with diphenyleneiodonium and Bay11-7082. Further investigation showed that IS induced NF-κB-responsive microRNA (miR)-155-5p mediating MGP downregulation. Overexpression of miR-155-5p with mimics aggravated IS-induced MGP reduction and osteogenic differentiation. In contrast, these conditions were diminished by silencing miR-155-5p. We demonstrate that IS promotes the HASMCs phenotype switch by suppressing MGP expression via ROS/NF-κB/miR-155-5p signaling and provide a new insight for the pathogenesis of IS-induced VC.

Abstract: Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been implicated in the promotion of malignant progression. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant (EGFRv) has been associated with glioma “stemness”. However, the molecular mechanism is not clear. In this study, we were committed to investigate the role of EGFRv in GSCs and presented a new therapeutic target in EGFRvIII positive GSCs. The results showed that EGFRvIII could induce the expression of p-Src and PLK1, and both could induce the Notch1-SOX2 signaling pathway to promote self-renewal and tumor progression of GSCs. Mechanistically, both p-Src and PLK1 can induce Notch1, and the intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD) can directly bind to SOX2, thereby promoting the maintenance of glioma stem cells. Furthermore, Saracatinib (Src inhibition) and BI2536 (PLK1 inhibition) diminished GSC self-renewal in vitro, and combining the two inhibitors increased survival of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, these data indicate that p-Src and PLK1 contribute to cancer stemness in EGFRvIII-positive GSCs by driving Notch1-SOX2 signaling, a finding that has important clinical implications.

Abstract: A large number of intracellular proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, one of the major protein degradation pathways. It produces peptides of several different sizes through protein degradation, and these peptides are rapidly degraded into free amino acids by various intracellular aminopeptidases. Previously, we reported that the activity of proteasomes and aminopeptidases in the proteolysis pathway are necessary for myoblast proliferation and differentiation. However, the detailed function of intracellular aminopeptidases in myoblast proliferation and differentiation has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we focused on alanine aminopeptidase (APN) and investigated the function of APN in C2C12 myoblast proliferation and differentiation. In myoblasts and myotubes, APN was mainly localized in the cell membrane as well as expressed at low levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The reduction of the APN enzymatic activity impaired the cell cycle progression in C2C12 myoblasts. In addition, apoptosis was induced after APN-knockdown. Finally, myogenic differentiation was also delayed in the APN-suppressed myoblasts. These findings indicate that APN is required for myoblast proliferation and differentiation.

Abstract: Prenatal opioids exposure can lead to both neonatal abstinence syndrome in newborns and neurological deficits later in life. Although opioids have been well studied in general, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which opioids affect human fetal brain development has not been well understood. In this work, we have taken advantage of a human 3D-brain cortical organoid (hCO) that facilitated enormously the investigation of early human brain development. Using imaging, immunofluorescence, multi-electrode array (MEA) and patch clamp recording techniques, we have investigated the effect of methadone, a frequently used opioid during pregnancy, on early neural development, including neuronal growth, neural network activity and synaptic transmission in hCOs. Our results demonstrated that methadone dose-dependently halted the growth of hCOs and induced organoid disintegration after a prolonged exposure. In addition, methadone dose-dependently suppressed the firing of spontaneous action potentials in hCOs and this suppression could be reversed upon methadone withdrawal in hCOs treated with lower dosages. Further investigation using patch clamp whole cell configuration revealed that, at clinically relevant concentrations, methadone decreased the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons, indicating a critical role of methadone in weakening synaptic transmission in neural networks in hCOs. In addition, methadone significantly attenuated the voltage-dependent Na+ current in hCOs. We conclude that methadone interrupts neural growth and function in early brain development.

Abstract: Environmental toxicants such as phthalate have been involved in multiple health disorders including renal diseases. Oxidative damage is implicated in many alterations caused by phthalate especially the di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is the most useful phthalate. However, information regarding its mechanism of renal damage is lacking. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates gene expression implicated in free radical scavenging and cytoprotection including the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) pathway. The aim of this study was to assess whether DEHP affects the Nrf2 pathway and the GSH concentration. Mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three groups treated with DEHP at different concentrations (5, 50, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Our results showed that DEHP altered the normal levels of serum biochemical parameters creatinine (CREA), urea, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This phthalate caused oxidative damage through the induction of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation as marked by increase of protein carbonyl (PC) and loss of protein-bound sulfhydryls (PSH). Simultaneously, DEHP treatment decreased the protein level of Nrf-2, HO-1, and GCLC (responsible of GSH synthesis) and decreased the GSH level. Inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway is related to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This apoptotic process is evidenced by an upregulation of p53 and Bax protein levels in addition to a downregulation of Bcl-2. Collectively, our data demonstrated that depletion of Nrf2 and GSH was associated with the elevation of oxidative stress and the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in mouse kidney treated with DEHP.

Abstract: Summary
The human-gut-DNA virome is highly diverse and individual specific, but little is known of its variation at a population level. Here, we report the fecal DNA virome of 930 healthy adult subjects from two regions in China (Hong Kong and Yunnan) spanning six ethnicities (Han, Zang, Miao, Bai, Dai, and Hani), and including urban and rural residents for each ethnicity. Twenty host factors were found to significantly correlate with the human-gut virome variation, with geography carrying the strongest impact and ethnicity-distinct diets associating with certain viral species. Urbanization enhances interindividual dissimilarities between gut viromes, with the duration of urban residence associating with multiple bacteriophages, including Lactobacillus phage and Lactococcus phage. Overall, the gut virome presents more heterogeneity relative to the bacterial microbiome across the examined Chinese populations. This study highlights population-based variations and the importance of host and environmental factors in shaping the DNA virome in the human gut.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a central part of immunity and hence is a key target of pathogens. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which plant pathogens manipulate autophagy remain elusive. We identify a network of 88 interactions between 184 effectors from bacterial, fungal, oomycete, and nematode pathogens with 25 Arabidopsis autophagy (ATG) proteins. Notably, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pto) bacterial effectors HrpZ1, HopF3, and AvrPtoB employ distinct molecular strategies to modulate autophagy. Calcium-dependent HrpZ1 oligomerization targets ATG4b-mediated cleavage of ATG8 to enhance autophagy, while HopF3 also targets ATG8 but suppresses autophagy, with both effectors promoting infection. AvrPtoB affects ATG1 kinase phosphorylation and enhances bacterial virulence. Since pathogens inject limited numbers of effectors into hosts, our findings establish autophagy as a key target during infection. Additionally, as autophagy is enhanced and inhibited by these effectors, autophagy likely has different functions throughout infection and, thus, must be temporally and precisely regulated for successful infection.

Abstract: Summary
Rpn13 is one of several ubiquitin receptors in the 26S proteasome. Cys88 of Rpn13 has been proposed to be the principal target of RA190, an electrophilic small molecule with interesting anti-cancer activities. Here, we examine the claim that RA190 mediates its cytotoxic effects through engagement with Rpn13. We find no evidence that this is the case. In vitro, RA190 is has no measurable effect on any of the known interactions of Rpn13. In cellulo, we see no physical engagement of Rpn13 by RA190, either on C88 or any other residue. However, chemical proteomics experiments in two different cell lines reveal that dozens of other proteins are heavily engaged by RA190. Finally, increasing or reducing the level of Rpn13 in HeLa and melanoma cells had no effect on the sensitivity of HeLa or melanoma cells to RA190. We conclude that Rpn13 is not the physiologically relevant target of RA190.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryos exhibit a transition from head morphogenesis to trunk elongation to meet the demand of axial elongation. The caudal neural tube (NT) is formed with neural progenitors (NPCs) derived from neuromesodermal progenitors localized at the tail tip. However, the molecular and cellular basis of elongating NT morphogenesis is yet elusive. Here, we provide evidence that caudal NPCs exhibit strong adhesion affinity that is gradually decreased along the anteroposterior (AP) axis in mouse embryonic spinal cord and human cellular models. Strong cell-cell adhesion causes collective migration, allowing AP alignment of NPCs depending on their birthdate. We further validated that this axial adhesion gradient is associated with the extracellular matrix and is under the control of graded Wnt signaling emanating from tail buds and antagonistic retinoic acid (RA) signaling. These results suggest that progressive reduction of NPC adhesion along the AP axis is under the control of Wnt-RA molecular networks, which is essential for a proper elongation of the spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent Zn2+ probes used for the quantitative analysis of labile Zn2+ concentration ([Zn2+]) in target organelles are crucial for understanding the role of Zn2+ in biological processes. Although several fluorescent Zn2+ probes have been developed to date, there is still a lack of consensus concerning the [Zn2+] in intracellular organelles. In this study, we describe the development of ZnDA-1H, a small-molecule fluorescent probe for Zn2+, which exhibits less pH sensitivity, high Zn2+ selectivity, and large fluorescence enhancement upon binding to Zn2+. Through protein labeling technology, ZnDA-1H was precisely targeted in various intracellular organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. ZnDA-1H exhibited a reversible fluorescence response toward labile Zn2+ in these organelles in live cells. Using this probe, the [Zn2+] in the Golgi apparatus was estimated to be 25 ± 1 nM, suggesting that labile Zn2+ plays a physiological role in the secretory pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) have a remarkable contribution to the hepatocytes and ductal cells when normal hepatocyte proliferation is severely impaired. As a biomarker for LPCs, Sry-box 9 (Sox9) plays critical roles in liver homeostasis and repair in response to injury. However, the regulation mechanism of Sox9 in liver physiological and pathological state remains unknown. In this study, we found that miR-126 positively regulated the expression of Sox9, the proliferation and differentiation of SOX9+ LPCs by suppressing the translation of homeobox b6 (Hoxb6). As a transcription factor, HOXB6 directly binds to the promoter of Sox9 to inhibit Sox9 expression, resulting in the destruction of the properties of SOX9+ LPCs in CCl4-induced liver injury. These findings revealed the role of miR-126 in regulating SOX9+ LPCs fate by targeting Hoxb6 in liver injury repair. Our findings suggest the potential role of miR-126 as a nucleic acid therapy drug target for liver failure.

Abstract: Corneal epithelial stem cells reside in the limbal area between the cornea and conjunctiva. We examined the potential use of limbal organoids as a source of transplantable limbal stem cells. After treating tissue with collagenase, limbal cells were seeded onto Matrigel and cultivated using limbal phenotype maintenance medium. After 1-month, approximately 500 organoids were formed from one donor cornea. Organoids derived from vertical sites (superior and inferior limbus) showed large colony forming efficiency, a higher ratio of slow cycling cells and N-cadherin-expressing epithelial cells compared to horizontal sites. The progenitor markers Keratin (K) 15 and p63 were expressed in epithelial sheets engineered form a single organoid. Organoids transplanted in the limbus of a rabbit limbal deficiency model confirmed the presence of organoid-derived cells extending on to host corneas by immunohistochemistry. Our data show that limbal organoids with a limbal phenotype can be maintained for up to 1 month in vitro which can each give rise to a fully stratified corneal epithelium complete with basal progenitor cells. Limbal organoids were successfully engrafted in vivo to provide epithelial cells in a rabbit limbal deficiency model, suggesting that organoids may be an efficient cell source for clinical use.

Abstract: Neutrophils have been recently identified in the atherosclerotic lesion and they can release neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) under the pro-inflammatory conditions prevailing in the lesion. Citrullinated histones (Cit-histones) are the major type of citrullinated proteins associated with NET release. Since elevated levels of citrullinated proteins have been detected in inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, this study analysed the role played by NET and Cit-histones in different atherogenic events in vitro. First, neutrophil recruitment and NET release in the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and oxidised LDL (Ox-LDL) were analysed by Boyden's chamber method and microscopy respectively. Then, LDL oxidation and LDL aggregation in the presence of NET and Cit-histones were analysed spectroscopically. Foam cell formation in the presence of NET or Cit-histone was studied by both microscopic and spectroscopic methods. While neutrophil recruitment was facilitated by Ox-LDL and not by LDL, the extent of NET release was significantly increased in the presence of both LDL and Ox-LDL. In the presence of NET, LDL oxidation, aggregation and foam cell formation were found to be increased. Cit-histones were found to accelerate LDL aggregation and foam cell formation at higher citrulline levels. Altogether, the results suggest that both NET and NET-associated Cit-histone released at the lesion can play major roles as pro-atherogenic mediators. Inhibiting the action of NET or Cit-histone would, therefore, be beneficial in slowing down atherosclerotic progression.

Abstract: Summary
TLX is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays a critical role in both embryonic and adult neurogenesis, as well in the pathogenesis of glioblastomas. TLX functions predominately as a transcriptional repressor, but no natural ligands or high-affinity synthetic ligands have been identified. Here, we describe the identification of natural and synthetic retinoids as functional ligands for TLX. We identified potent synthetic retinoids that directly bind to TLX and either activate or inhibit its transcriptional repressor activity. Furthermore, we identified all-trans and 11-cis retinaldehyde (retinal), retinoids that play an essential role in the visual cycle, as the preferential natural retinoids that bind to and modulate the function of TLX. Molecular dynamics simulations followed by mutational analysis provided insight into the molecular basis of retinoid binding to TLX. Our data support the validity of TLX as a target for development of therapeutics to treat cognitive disorders and/or glioblastomas.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ANRIL has been reported to be closely related to the relapse of multiple myeloma patients. However, the functional role and underlying mechanism of lncRNA ANRIL in multiple myeloma are not known. This study aims to investigate the biological function of lncRNA ANRIL in multiple myeloma. In this study, compared with normal tissues from healthy donors, lncRNA ANRIL and HIF-1α expressions were up-regulated in tumor tissues from multiple myeloma patients. miR-411–3p expression was down-regulated in tumor tissues from multiple myeloma patients. Besides, lncRNA ANRIL can interact with miR-411–3p. HIF-1α was confirmed to be a target of miR-411–3p. Correlation analysis showed that lncRNA ANRIL expression was negatively correlated with miR-411–3p expression. HIF-1α expression was negatively correlated with miR-411–3p expression. Further transfection experiments showed that knockdown of ANRIL or overexpression of miR-411–3p significantly inhibited cell proliferation, tumor formation ability and tumor stem cell like property, promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Finally, miR-411–3p mimic reduced tumor volume, improved survival rate, suppressed malignant proliferation and tumor stem cell like property in U266 xenograft model. Our results demonstrate that lncRNA ANRIL mediated by miR-411–3p promotes the malignant proliferation and tumor stem cell like property of multiple myeloma through regulating HIF-1α.

Abstract: Relative to conventional two-dimensional (2-D) culture, three-dimensional (3-D) suspension culture of epithelial cells more closely mimics the in vivo cell microenvironment regarding cell architecture, cell to matrix interaction, and osmosis exchange. However, primary normal human keratinocytes (NHKc) rapidly undergo terminal differentiation and detachment-induced cell death (anoikis) upon disconnection from the basement membrane, thus greatly constraining their use in 3-D suspension culture models. Here, we examined the 3-D anchorage-free growth potential of NHKc isolated from neonatal skin explants of 59 different individuals. We found that 40% of all isolates naturally self-assembled into multicellular spheroids within 24 h in anchorage-free culture, while 60% did not. Placing a single spheroid back into 2-D monolayer culture yielded proliferating cells that expressed elevated levels of nuclear P63 and basal cytokeratin 14. These cells also displayed prolonged keratinocyte renewal and a gene expression profile corresponding to cellular heterogeneity, quiescence, and de-differentiation. Notably, spheroid-derived (SD) NHKc were enriched for a P63/K14 double-positive population that formed holoclonal colonies and reassembled into multicellular spheroids during 3-D suspension subculture. This study reveals marked phenotypic differences in neonatal keratinocyte suspension cultures isolated from different individuals andpresenta model system that can be readily employed to study epithelial cell behavior, along with a variety of dermatological diseases.

Abstract: In previous work, we showed that highly proliferative cells and cancer cells, but not cells with normal growth rate, have tubules rich in alpha-1,2 fucosylated epitopes that extend radially from the nucleus to the cell periphery and form an unusual uptake system. The importance of alpha-1,2 fucosylation in forming tubules was demonstrated by proving that down-regulating the two corresponding fucosyltransferases (FUT1 and FUT2) causes tubule fragmentation. Here, we present evidence that in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, the tubules arise in actively growing cells from vesicles in the medial and trans elements of a partially fragmented Golgi complex, while in not actively growing cells the tubules become completely independent from the Golgi complex. Formation and elongation of the tubules proved to depend on the actin cytoskeleton, since the alpha-1,2 fucosylated protein(s) segregate with the cytoskeleton proteins, and not in the membrane fraction, as do the Golgi markers and other fucosylated proteins, while depolymerization of the actin filaments causes tubule fragmentation and shifting of the alpha-1,2 fucosylated proteins into the membrane fraction.

Abstract: Our present study investigated whether exosome secretion of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is regulated by autophagy. Different autophagic states of NPCs were induced by rapamycin (Rap), bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and other agents, and it was found that exosomes were secreted in an autophagy-dependent manner. Activation or inhibition of autophagy increased or decreased, respectively, the amount of exosomes that were released into the extracellular space. In addition, in order to confirm that Rap-promoted release of exosomes was mediated by autophagy rather than other pathways, we used autophagy associated gene 5 (ATG5) small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the expression of ATG5 gene, which is indispensable for autophagy. The results showed that siRNA against ATG5 (siATG5) induced an accumulation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in NPCs and a concomitant decrease in the amount of exosomes isolated from supernatant. Ras homolog gene (Rho) and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) family molecules are capable of cytoskeletal remodeling and affecting vesicle transport. Therefore, we carried out targeted interventions and evaluated the effects of the RhoC/ROCK2 pathway on the secretion of exosomes within autophagic environment. Knockdown of RhoC and ROCK2 with corresponding siRNA significantly inhibited the secretion of exosomes originating from ILVs in NPCs, even when NPCs were subsequently treated with Rap. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophagy positively regulates expression levels of RhoC and ROCK2, and that the RhoC/ROCK2 pathway exerts a key function on NPCs-derived exosome secretion.

Abstract: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that result in severe loss of supporting structures and substantial tooth loss. Oxidative stress is tightly involved in the progression of periodontitis. Tripartite Motif 16 (TRIM16) has been identified as a novel regulatory protein in response to oxidative and proteotoxic stresses. The present study aimed to investigate the role of TRIM16 in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) under oxidative stress. First, we found that the expression of TRIM16 decreased after exposure to H2O2. Then TRIM16 overexpression alleviated H2O2-induced oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant capacity and reducing the amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). TRIM16 increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential in hPDLSCs. Furthermore, TRIM16 attenuated H2O2-induced suppression of osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, TRIM16 promoted the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)-interacting cousin of thioredoxin (PICOT), p-Akt and Nrf2, while knockdown of PICOT reversed TRIM16-mediated ROS resistance and decreased the expression of p-Akt and Nrf2. In conclusion, TRIM16 alleviated oxidative damage in hPDLSCs via the activation of PICOT/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, suggesting that TRIM16 could be a promising target to develop effective therapies for periodontitis.

Abstract: Summary
The subventricular zone of the mammalian brain is the major source of adult born neurons. These neuroblasts normally migrate long distances to the olfactory bulbs but can be re-routed to locations of injury and promote neuroregeneration. Mechanistic understanding and pharmacological targets regulating neuroblast migration is sparse. Furthermore, lack of migration assays limits development of pharmaceutical interventions targeting neuroblast recruitment. We therefore developed a physiologically relevant 3D neuroblast spheroid migration assay that permits the investigation of large numbers of interventions. To verify the assay, 1,012 kinase inhibitors were screened for their effects on migration. Several induced significant increases or decreases in migration. MuSK and PIK3CB were selected as putative targets and their knockdown validated increased neuroblast migration. Thus, compounds identified through this assay system could be explored for their potential in augmenting neuroblast recruitment to sites of injury for neuroregeneration, or for decreasing malignant invasion.

Abstract: Lung toxicity is the main cause of the death from methamphetamine (MA) abuse, but its mechanism has remained unclear. The purpose of our study was to investigate if MA can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and if RUNX3 is involved in oxidative EMT in MA-induced chronic lung injury. The rats were divided into the control group and MA group. Extracted lungs were used for morphological measurements and Western blot. The alveolar epithelial cells were cultured or transfected and then treated with MA or/and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) followed by flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Chronic exposure to MA resulted in the lower growth ratio of weight, increased right ventricular index, thickened alveolar walls, and reduced number of alveolar sacs. Long-term administration with MA caused oxidative stress and pulmonary EMT. NAC increased RUNX3 and alleviated EMT. However, after knockdown of RUNX3, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly upregulated, indicating that RUNX3 was closely related to oxidative stress. Knockdown of RUNX3 aggravated MA-induced EMT by activating RUNX3-dependent TGF-β signaling. Therefore, RUNX3 may be the key to oxidative EMT in methamphetamine-induced chronic lung injury.

Abstract: The secretory pathway of neurons and endocrine cells contains a variety of mechanisms designed to combat cellular stress. These include not only the unfolded protein response pathways but also diverse chaperone proteins that collectively work to ensure proteostatic control of secreted and membrane-bound molecules. One of the least studied of these chaperones is the neural- and endocrine-specific molecule known as proSAAS. This small chaperone protein acts as a potent anti-aggregant both in vitro and in cellulo and also represents a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker in Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we have examined the idea that proSAAS, like other secretory chaperones, might represent a stress-responsive protein. We find that exposure of neural and endocrine cells to the cell stressors tunicamycin and thapsigargin increases cellular proSAAS mRNA and protein in Neuro2A cells. Paradoxically, proSAAS secretion is inhibited by these same drugs. Exposure of Neuro2A cells to low concentrations of the hypoxic stress inducer cobalt chloride, or to sodium arsenite, an oxidative stressor, also increases cellular proSAAS content and reduces its secretion. We conclude that the cellular levels of the small secretory chaperone proSAAS are positively modulated by cell stress.

Abstract: FAM122A is a housekeeping gene and highly conserved in mammals. More recently, we have demonstrated that FAM122A is essential for maintaining the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, in which we unexpectedly found that FAM122A deletion increases γH2AX protein level, suggesting that FAM122A may participate in the regulation of DNA homeostasis or stability. In this study, we continued to investigate the potential role of FAM122A in DNA damage and/or repair. We found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FAM122A deletion enhances endogenous DNA damages in cancer cells but not in normal cells, demonstrating a significant increase in γH2AX protein and foci formation of γH2AX and 53BP1, as well as DNA breaks by comet assay. Further, we found that FAM122A deletion greatly increases TOP2α protein level, and significantly and specifically enhances TOP2 poisons (etoposide and doxorubicin)-induced DNA damage effects in cancer cells. Moreover, FAM122A is found to be interacted with TOP2α, instead of TOP2β. However, FAM122A knockout doesn’t affect the intracellular ROS levels and the process of DNA repair after removal of etoposide with short-term stimulation, suggesting that FAM122A deletion-enhanced DNA damage does not result from endogenous overproduction of ROS and/or impairment of DNA repair ability. Collectively, our study provides the first demonstration that FAM122A is critical for maintaining DNA stability probably by modulating TOP2α protein, and FAM122A deletion combined with TOP2-targeted drugs may represent a potential novel chemotherapeutic strategy for cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
Progressive lung fibrosis is a major cause of mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate that immune complexes (ICs) activate human monocytes to promote lung fibroblast migration partly via osteopontin (OPN) secretion, which is amplified by autocrine monocyte colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrate that elevated OPN expression in SSc lung tissue is enriched in macrophages, partially overlapping with CCL18 expression. Serum OPN is elevated in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and prognosticates future lung function deterioration in SSc cohorts. Serum OPN levels decrease following tocilizumab (monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor) treatment, confirming the connection between IL-6 and OPN in SSc patients. Collectively, these data suggest a plausible link between autoantibodies and lung fibrosis progression, where circulating OPN serves as a systemic proxy for IC-driven profibrotic macrophage activity, highlighting its potential as a promising biomarker in SSc ILD.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer unprecedented opportunities for the investigation of multigenic disease, personalized medicine, and stem cell therapy. For heterogeneous diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF), however, precise correction of the associated mutation is crucial. Here, we generated and corrected hiPSC lines from two AF patients carrying different heterozygous SHOX2 mutations. We developed a strategy for the scarless correction of heterozygous mutations, based on stochastic enrichment by sib selection, followed by allele quantification via digital PCR and next-generation sequencing to detect isogenic subpopulations. This allowed enriching edited cells 8- to 20-fold. The method does not require antibiotic selection or cell sorting and can be easily combined with base-and-prime editing approaches. Our strategy helps to overcome low efficiencies of homology-dependent repair in hiPSCs and facilitates the generation of isogenic control lines that represent the gold standard for modeling complex diseases in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Aflatoxin contamination of crops is a serious problem worldwide. Utilization of aflatoxin production inhibitors is attractive, as the elucidation of their modes of action contributes to clarifying the mechanism of aflatoxin production. Here, we identified mitochondrial protease ClpP as the target of dioctatin, an inhibitor of aflatoxin production of Aspergillus flavus. Dioctatin conferred uncontrolled caseinolytic capacity on ClpP of A. flavus and Escherichia coli. Dioctatin-bound ClpP selectively degraded mitochondrial energy-related proteins in vitro, including a subunit of respiratory chain complex V, which was also reduced by dioctatin in a ClpP-dependent manner in vivo. Dioctatin enhanced glycolysis and alcohol fermentation while reducing tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites. These disturbances were accompanied by reduced histone acetylation and reduced expression of aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. Our results suggest that dioctatin inhibits aflatoxin production by inducing ClpP-mediated degradation of mitochondrial energy-related components, and that mitochondrial energy metabolism functions as a key determinant of aflatoxin production.

Abstract: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells with self-renewal properties, making them an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine. Recently, numerous studies show that about more than 99% of transplanted cells are destroyed because of the stressful microenvironment. Meanwhile, in the target organs, iron overload can produce oxidative stress introducing it as the most important stress factor. The present study was aimed at increasing BM-MSCs’ viability against oxidative stress microenvironment using iron depletion by deferoxamine (DFO). Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and characterized from rat bone marrow. Then, the sensitivity of BM-MSCs against H2O2-induced oxidative stress was evaluated through half of the inhibitory concentration (IC50) estimation by using MTT assay. The maximum non-inhibitory concentration of DFO on BM-MSCs was determined. The next step was the comparison between DFO pre-treated BM-MSCs and untreated cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis. BM-MSCs were identified with morphologic and flow cytometry analysis. IC50 of H2O2 was determined as 0.55mM at 4 h. Also, the maximum non-inhibitory concentration of DFO was ascertained as 5μm at 48 h. Our results demonstrated that pretreatment with DFO significantly potentiates BM-MSCs against H2O2-induced oxidative stress which was confirmed by MTT assay, AO/EB double staining, DAPI staining, and activated caspase 3 quantification as well as western blot test. Expression of cleaved caspase 3 and pAKT/AKT ratio obviously demonstrated DFO can resist the cells against cytotoxicity. These findings may help to develop better stem cell culture medium for MSC-based cell therapy. Moreover, regulation of cell stress can be used in practical subjects.

Abstract: Summary
The inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are a ubiquitous group of highly phosphorylated eukaryotic messengers. They have been linked to a panoply of central cellular processes, but a detailed understanding of the discrete signaling events is lacking in most cases. To create a more mechanistic picture of PP-InsP signaling, we sought to annotate the mammalian interactome of the most abundant inositol pyrophosphate 5PP-InsP5. To do so, triplexed affinity reagents were developed, in which a metabolically stable PP-InsP analog was immobilized in three different ways. Application of these triplexed reagents to mammalian lysates identified between 300 and 400 putative interacting proteins. These interactomes revealed connections between 5PP-InsP5 and central cellular regulators, such as lipid phosphatases, protein kinases, and GTPases, and identified protein domains commonly targeted by 5PP-InsP5. Both the triplexed affinity reagents, and the proteomic datasets, constitute powerful resources for the community, to launch future investigations into the multiple signaling modalities of inositol pyrophosphates.

Abstract: Limited treatment options and development of resistance to targeted therapy within few months pose significant challenges in the treatment of BRAF-mutated malignant melanoma. Moreover, extensive angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry promote the rapid progression of disease. The purpose of this study was to develop a protein kinase C inhibitor anchored BRD4 PROTAC (ARV) loaded PEGylated nanoliposomes (LARPC). Palmitoyl-dl-carnitine chloride (PC) was used as a protein kinase C inhibitor to provide a cationic surface charge to LARPC. The formulation was characterized for particle size, zeta potential, drug release and various cell culture assays using HUVEC and vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells. The particle size of LARPC was found to be 105.25 ± 2.76 nm with a zeta potential of +26.6 ± 6.25 mV. Inhibition of angiogenesis was demonstrated by ARV and LARPC using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)-based matrigel basement membrane model. Additionally, LARPC demonstrated very low IC50 with promising inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry channel formation, cell migration as well as colony formation in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines. Hence, the outcome of this combination therapy indicated the suitability of LARPC as a potential and novel approach for eradicating vemurafenib-resistant melanoma.

Abstract: Objectives
Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is the most common congenital pulmonary anomaly with unknown etiology. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to map its cellular landscape and identify the underlying cellular and molecular events related to CCAM.
Methods
This study involved a 4.25 year old patient with grade Ⅱ–Ⅲ CCAM at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University. Samples of lesioned and non-lesioned areas were collected during surgery for scRNA-seq.
Results
In total, 19,904 cells were obtained with median UMI counts of 7032 per cell and 1995 median genes per cell. In terms of lesioned and non-lesioned areas, epithelial cells accounted for 27.23% and 17.85%, respectively, while mesenchymal cells accounted for 2.67% and 16.06%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Further clustering of epithelial cells revealed that the fractions of alveolar type 1 cells (AT1, N: 23.65%; L: 49.81%), AT2(N: 2.02%; L: 5.26%), club-1(N: 9.02%; L: 17.57%), club-3(N: 1.18%; L: 4.15%), and basal cells (N: 0.34%; L: 2.93%) were increased in lesioned samples (P < 0.0001). Pseudotime trajectory analysis showed tracks of club-1/basal cells→AT2→club-3→AT1 and club-1,2/basal→AT2. Mast cells (N: 0.63%; L: 2.48%) were also increased in lesioned samples and interactions of CD44 with HBEGF and FGFR2 were detected between mast and epithelial cells.
Conclusions
AT1, AT2, club, and basal cells were increased in CCAM patients, and newly defined club-1/3 and basal cells might be the origin of proliferating AT1 and AT2 cells. Increased mast cells might promote epithelial cell proliferation through interactions of CD44 with HBEGF and FGFR2.

Abstract: Stem Cell Antigen-1 (SCA-1) is a central positive marker for isolating stem cells in several tissues in the mouse. However, for the epidermis, this appears to be the opposite since lack of SCA-1 has been shown to identify keratinocyte populations with progenitor characteristics. This study investigates the effect of SCA-1 knockout in murine keratinocytes. We compared Sca-1EGFP/EGFP knockout and wildtype mice with respect to the three-dimensional morphology of the epidermis, performed functional assays, and generated gene expression profiles on FACS sorted cells. There were no morphological abnormalities on skin, fur, or hair follicles in transgenic knockout mice compared to wild type mice. SCA-1 knockout keratinocytes showed significantly reduced colony-forming efficiency, colony size and proliferation rate in vitro, however, SCA-1 knockout did not alter wound healing efficiency or keratinocyte proliferation rate in vivo. Moreover, gene expression profiling shows that the effect from knockout of SCA-1 in keratinocytes is dissimilar from what has been observed in other tissues. Additionally, tumor assay indicated that SCA-1 knockout decreases the number of formed papillomas. The results indicate a more complex role for SCA-1, which might differ between epidermal keratinocytes during homeostasis and activated conditions.

Abstract: High expression of the immune checkpoint receptor PD-L1 is associated with worse patient outcome in a variety of human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Binding of PD-L1 with its partner PD-1 generates an inhibitory signal that dampens the immune system. Immunotherapy, that is blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint, has proven to be an effective tool in cancer therapy. However, not all patients are able to benefit from this immune checkpoint inhibition. Therefore, evidence is growing of intrinsic PD-L1 signaling in cancer cells. For example, intrinsic PD-L1 expression was associated with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which is part of diverse oncogenic processes including cell proliferation, growth and survival. In this study we demonstrate the effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition by buparlisib on PD-L1 expression in HNSCC cell lines. After buparlisib treatment for 72 h, PD-L1 was downregulated in total cell lysates of HNSCC cells. Moreover, flow cytometry revealed a downregulation of PD-L1 membrane expression. Interestingly, the buparlisib mediated effects on PD-L1 expression were reduced by additional irradiation. In PD-L1 overexpressing cells, the buparlisib induced inhibition of proliferation was neutralized. In summary, our findings imply that blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could be a good additional therapy for patients who show poor response to immune checkpoint therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells underlies type 1 diabetes (T1D). To understand T cell-mediated immune effects on human pancreatic β cells, we combine β cell-specific expression of a model antigen, CD19, and anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. Coculturing CD19-expressing β-like cells and CD19 CAR-T cells results in T cell-mediated β-like cell death with release of activated T cell cytokines. Transcriptome analysis of β-like cells and human islets treated with conditioned medium of the immune reaction identifies upregulation of immune reaction genes and the pyroptosis mediator GSDMD as well as its activator CASP4. Caspase-4-mediated cleaved GSDMD is detected in β-like cells under inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. Among immune-regulatory genes, PDL1 is one of the most upregulated, and PDL1 overexpression partially protects human β-like cells transplanted into mice. This experimental platform identifies potential mechanisms of β cell destruction and may allow testing of therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) is a central regulator of fetal brain development and cognitive function in adults. However, the roles of HTR2A in the cardiovascular system are not fully understood. Here in this study, we explored the function of HTR2A in cardiac hypertrophy. Significantly, the expression levels of HTR2A mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in hypertrophic hearts of human patients. Besides, the expression of HTR2A was also upregulated in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in the mouse. Next, the expression of HTR2A was knocked down with shRNA or overexpressed with adenovirus in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and ISO was used to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We showed that HTR2A knockdown repressed ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which was demonstrated by decreased cardiomyocyte size and repressed expression of hypertrophic fetal genes (e.g., myosin heavy chain beta (β-Mhc), atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp), and brain natriuretic peptide (Bnp)). By contrast, HTR2A overexpression promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Of note, we observed that HTR2A promoted the activation (phosphorylation) of AKT-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling in cardiomyocytes, and repression of AKT-mTOR with perifosine or rapamycin blocked the effects of HTR2A on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Finally, we showed that HTR2A regulated AKT-mTOR signaling through activating the PI3K-PDK1 pathway, and inhibition of either PI3K or PDK1 blocked the roles of HTR2A in regulating AKT-mTOR signaling and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Altogether, these findings demonstrated that HTR2A activated PI3K-PDK1-AKT-mTOR signaling and promoted cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSCs) are a well-studied cellular therapy with many clinical trials over the last few decades to treat a range of therapeutic indications. Recently, extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs (MSC-EVs) have been shown to recapitulate many of the therapeutic effects of the MSCs themselves. While research in MSC-EVs has exploded, it is still early in their development towards a clinical therapy. One of the main challenges in cellular therapy, which will clearly also be a challenge in MSC-EV manufacturing, is developing a scalable, cGMP-compatible manufacturing paradigm. Therefore, the focus of this review is to identify some key MSC-EV manufacturing considerations such as the selection of critical raw materials, manufacturing platforms, and critical quality attribute assays. Addressing these issues early in research and development will accelerate clinical product development, clinical trials, and commercial therapies of MSC-EVs.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin is an essential growth factor for the survival and self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Although it is best known as the principal hormone promoting glycolysis in somatic cells, insulin's roles in hESC energy metabolism remain unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that insulin is essential to sustain hESC mitochondrial respiration that is rapidly decreased upon insulin removal. Insulin-dependent mitochondrial respiration is stem cell specific, and mainly relies on pyruvate and glutamine, while glucose suppresses excessive oxidative phosphorylation. Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations reveal that continuous insulin signal sustains mitochondrial respiration through PI3K/AKT activation and downstream GSK3 inhibition. We further show that insulin acts through GSK3 inhibition to suppress caspase activation and rescue cell survival. This study uncovers a critical role of the AKT/GSK3 pathway in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and cell survival, highlighting insulin as an essential factor for accurate assessment of mitochondrial respiration in hESCs.

Abstract: Chronic oxidative stress resulting from hyperlipidemia is thought to be a key pathogenic driver of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in leading to the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly recognized to regulate dysfunction within pancreatic β-cells in the context of T2DM. In the present study, we sought to comprehensively analyze the roles of lncRNAs in dysfunctional β-cells and mouse islets. Analyses of INS-1E cells were performed by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR after treating with or without 0.5 mM palmitate for 4 days, leading us to identify the novel lncRNA Eif4g2 (lncEif4g2) as a functional regulator within these cells. When we overexpressed lncEif4g2 in INS-1E β-cells and mouse islets, this was sufficient for the reversal of palmitate-mediated reductions in cell viability, insulin production, ATP production by mitochondria, and creation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the dysfunction of mouse islets, with nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation also being observed. In contrast, when lncEif4g2 was knocked down this led INS-1E cells and mouse islets to become more sensitive to palmitate-induced dysfunction, with reduced Nrf2 nuclear translocation also being detected. When antioxidants were used to treat INS-1E cells and mouse islets, however, these negative effects were reversed. Additional functional analyses revealed lncEif4g2 to be capable of directly binding to miR-3074–5p in β-cells, with the expression of lncEif4g2 and miR-3074–5p being negatively correlated with one another. We further found that cAMP-responsive element binding-protein (CREB) was a miR-3074–5p target gene in these cells, thus at least in part serving as a functional mediator of the lncEif4g2/miR-3074–5p axis within dysfunctional β-cells. In summary, our results thus reveal that lncEif4g2 is able to indirectly regulate the expression of CREB via targeting miR-3074–5p in INS-1E cells and mouse islets, thereby leading to enhanced Nrf2 activation.

Abstract: Summary
H2S-producing enzymes in bacteria have been shown to be closely engaged in the process of microbial survival and antibiotic resistance. However, no inhibitors have been discovered for these enzymes, e.g., 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). In the present study, we identified several classes of inhibitors for Escherichia coli MST (eMST) through high-throughput screening of ∼26,000 compounds. The thiazolidinedione-type inhibitors were found to selectively bind to Arg178 and Ser239 residues of eMST but hardly affected human MST. Moreover, the pioglitazone of this class concentration dependently accumulates the 3-mercaptopyruvate substrate and suppresses the H2S and reactive sulfane sulfur products in bacteria. Importantly, pioglitazone could potentiate the level of reactive oxygen species in cellulo and consequently enhance the antimicrobial effects of gentamicin and macrophages in culture. This study has identified the bioactive inhibitor of eMST, paving the way for the pharmacological targeting of eMST to synergistically control the survival of E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
During brain development, neural stem cells (NSCs) initially produce neurons and change their fate to generate glias. While the regulation of neurogenesis is well characterized, specific markers for glial precursor cells (GPCs) and the master regulators for gliogenesis remain unidentified. Accumulating evidence suggests that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have significant roles in neuronal development and function, as they comprehensively regulate the expression of target genes in a cell-type-specific manner. We systematically investigated the expression profiles of 1,436 murine RBPs in the developing mouse brain and identified quaking (Qk) as a marker of the putative GPC population. Functional analysis of the NSC-specific Qk-null mutant mouse revealed the key role of Qk in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte generation and differentiation from NSCs. Mechanistically, Qk upregulates gliogenic genes via quaking response elements in their 3′ untranslated regions. These results provide crucial directions for identifying GPCs and deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of gliogenesis from NSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted largely by respiratory droplets or airborne aerosols. Despite being frequently found in the immediate environment and feces of patients, evidence supporting the oral acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 is unavailable. Using the Syrian hamster model, we demonstrate that the severity of pneumonia induced by the intranasal inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 increases with virus inoculum. SARS-CoV-2 retains its infectivity in vitro in simulated human-fed-gastric and fasted-intestinal fluid after 2 h. Oral inoculation with the highest intranasal inoculum (105 PFUs) causes mild pneumonia in 67% (4/6) of the animals, with no weight loss. The lung histopathology score and viral load are significantly lower than those infected by the lowest intranasal inoculum (100 PFUs). However, 83% of the oral infections (10/12 hamsters) have a level of detectable viral shedding from oral swabs and feces similar to that of intranasally infected hamsters. Our findings indicate that the oral acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 can establish subclinical respiratory infection with less efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial respiration (oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) is an emerging target in currently refractory cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the variability of energetic metabolic adaptations between PDAC patients has not been assessed in functional investigations. In this work, we demonstrate that OXPHOS rates are highly heterogeneous between patient tumors, and that high OXPHOS tumors are enriched in mitochondrial respiratory complex I at protein and mRNA levels. Therefore, we treated PDAC cells with phenformin (complex I inhibitor) in combination with standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine), showing that this treatment is synergistic specifically in high OXPHOS cells. Furthermore, phenformin cooperates with gemcitabine in high OXPHOS tumors in two orthotopic mouse models (xenografts and syngeneic allografts). In conclusion, this work proposes a strategy to identify PDAC patients likely to respond to the targeting of mitochondrial energetic metabolism in combination with chemotherapy, and that phenformin should be clinically tested in appropriate PDAC patient subpopulations.

Abstract: Summary
Phagosomes must maintain membrane integrity to exert their microbicidal function. Some microorganisms, however, survive and grow within phagosomes. In such instances, phagosomes must expand to avoid rupture and microbial escape. We studied whether phagosomes regulate their size to preserve integrity during infection with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Phagosomes release calcium as C. albicans hyphae elongate, inducing lysosome recruitment and insertion, thereby increasing the phagosomal surface area. As hyphae grow, the expanding phagosome consumes the majority of free lysosomes. Simultaneously, lysosome biosynthesis is stimulated by activation of TFEB, a transcriptional regulator of lysosomal biogenesis. Preventing lysosomal insertion causes phagosomal rupture, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1β secretion and host-cell death. Whole-genome transcriptomic analysis demonstrate that stress responses elicited in C. albicans upon engulfment are reversed if phagosome expansion is prevented. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby phagosomes maintain integrity while expanding, ensuring that growing pathogens remain entrapped within this microbicidal compartment.

Abstract: The fundamental reasons for considering the adoption of hydrogen as a fuel, industrial feedstock and energy storage medium are presented. Hydrogen production methods are outlined, with reference to the colour prefixes used to describe different types of hydrogen. The relative greenhouse gas emissions and economics of green and blue hydrogen production are considered for achieving a ‘net zero’ climate-neutral energy system by 2050. In general, it appears that green hydrogen will soon be cheaper than blue hydrogen due to the falling costs of renewable electricity and electrolysers, then cheaper than grey hydrogen, and in the long term potentially cheaper than natural gas.

Abstract: Summary
Mother’s milk contains complex microbial communities thought to be important for colonizing a preterm infant’s gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about the microbiota in the preterm mother’s milk and factors influencing its composition. We characterized the temporal dynamics of microbial communities in 490 breast milk samples from 86 mothers of preterm infants (born <1,250g) over the first 8 weeks postpartum. Highly individualized microbial communities were identified in each mother’s milk that changed temporally with notable alterations in predicted microbial functions. However, pre-pregnancy BMI, delivery mode, and antibiotics were associated with changes in these microbial dynamics. Individual classes of antibiotics and their duration of exposure during prenatal and postpartum periods showed unique relationships with microbial taxa abundance and diversity in mother’s milk. These results highlight the temporal complexity of the preterm mother’s milk microbiota and its relationship with maternal characteristics as well as the importance of discussing antibiotic stewardship for mothers.

Comprehensive datasets are accessible prior to purchase detailing the disease background of the original tissue sample, background of iPSC reprogramming and cell line characterisation data. EBiSC also performs robust QC screening to ensure supply of reliable, well-characterised iPSC lines, compliant with ISO9001:2015 principles. Whole Genome Sequencing data for specific iPSC lines can be downloaded from the European Genome Archive, subject to application to the EBiSC Data Access Committee. The EBiSC Access and Use Agreement, required to be completed prior to shipping, can be downloaded from the website along with specific Cell Line Information Packs; together these documents clarify how EBiSC lines can be used for research and detail any specific Third Party Obligations and/or restrictions for use which may apply. A protocol for how to culture and monitor iPSC lines including implementation of routine cell line screening is also available. A second project phase will continue collecting iPSC lines generated internationally, provide iPSC derived differentiated products using improved automation strategies for upscaling and develop the current services provided by EBiSC, including iPSC reprogramming, gene-editing and characterisation.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can undergo unlimited self-renewal and differentiate into hepatic cells, including expandable hepato-blasts (HBs) and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) in vitro. Therefore, hESC-derived HBs have the potential to become a renewable cell source for cell therapy of serious liver damage. However, one of the key challenges for such cell therapy is the allogeneic immune rejection of hESC-derived HBs. To overcome this challenge, we developed a strategy to protect the hESC-derived HBs from allogeneic immune rejection by ectopically expressing immune suppressive molecules CTLA4-Ig and PD-L1, denoted CP HBs. Like HBs derived from normal hESCs, CP HBs are capable of repairing liver damage in animal models. Using humanized mice (Hu-mice) reconstituted with human immune system, we showed that CP HBs are protected from allogeneic immune system and can survive long-term in Hu-mice. These data support the feasibility to develop CP HBs into a cell therapy to treat serious liver damage.

The cleft palate candidate gene BAG6 supports FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated apoptosis during palate fusion,
Experimental Cell Research,

Abstract: Background
Cleft palate is a common craniofacial defect, which occurs when the palate fails to fuse during development. During fusion, the palatal shelves migrate towards the embryonic midline to form a seam. Apoptotic elimination of medial edge epithelium (MEE) cells along this seam is required for the completion of palate fusion.
Methods
Whole exome sequencing (WES) of six Chinese cleft palate families was applied to identify novel cleft palate-associated gene variants. Palatal fusion and immunofluorescence studies were performed in a murine palatal shelf organ culture model. Gene and protein expression were analyzed by qPCR and immunoblotting in murine MEE cells during seam formation in vivo. Mechanistic immunoprecipitation studies were performed in murine MEE cells in vitro.
Results
WES identified Bcl-2 associated anthanogene 6 (BAG6) as a novel cleft palate-associated gene. In murine MEE cells, we discovered upregulation of Bag6 and the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) during seam formation in vivo. Using a palatal shelf organ culture model, we demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 enhances MEE cell apoptosis by promoting p300's acetylation of FoxO1, thereby promoting transcription of the pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (FasL). Subsequent gain- and loss-of-function studies in the organ culture model demonstrated that FasL is required for Bag6/acFoxO1-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Bax/caspase-3 signaling, MEE apoptosis, and palate fusion. Palatal shelf contact was shown to enhance Bag6 nuclear localization and upregulate nuclear acFoxO1 in MEE cells.
Conclusions
These findings demonstrate that nuclear-localized Bag6 and p300 co-operatively enhance FoxO1 acetylation to promote FasL-mediated MEE apoptosis during palate fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Most organs and tissues in the body, including bone, can repair after an injury due to the activation of endogenous adult stem/progenitor cells to replace the damaged tissue. Inherent dysfunctions of the endogenous stem/progenitor cells in skeletal repair disorders are still poorly understood. Here, we report that Fgfr3Y637C/+ over-activating mutation in Prx1-derived skeletal stem/progenitor cells leads to failure of fracture consolidation. We show that periosteal cells (PCs) carrying the Fgfr3Y637C/+ mutation can engage in osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, but following transplantation do not undergo terminal chondrocyte hypertrophy and transformation into bone causing pseudarthrosis. Instead, Prx1Cre;Fgfr3Y637C/+ PCs give rise to fibrocartilage and fibrosis. Conversely, wild-type PCs transplanted at the fracture site of Prx1Cre;Fgfr3Y637C/+ mice allow hypertrophic cartilage transition to bone and permit fracture consolidation. The results thus highlight cartilage-to-bone transformation as a necessary step for bone repair and FGFR3 signaling within PCs as a key regulator of this transformation.

Abstract: Purpose
Colon cancer is a common caner with high death rate in the world. The study aimed to detect the effect and mechanism of long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) MIR503HG on colon cancer.
Methods
The MIR503HG expression was measured in colon cancer tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells were measured by MTT, flow-cytometry, wound healing and transwell assay. The protein expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin was detected by Western blot. The target relationships among MIR503HG, miR-107 and Par4 were predicted by StarBase and TargetScan, and verified by luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay. The xenograft tumor model was constructed in mice to verify the inhibitory effect of MIR503HG in vivo.
Results
The expression of MIR503HG was decreased in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. MIR503HG overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoted cell apoptosis, down-regulated N-cadherin and Vimentin, and up-regulated E-cadherin in colon cancer. MIR503HG negatively regulated its target miR-107. MiR-107 overexpression reversed the anti-tumor effects of MIR503HG overexpression on colon cancer cells. Par4 was a target of miR-107, which was positively regulated by MIR503HG. The promoting effects of MIR503HG silencing on colon cancer cells were eliminated by Par4 overexpression.
Conclusion
MIR503HG regulated Par4 via sponging miR-107 in colon cancer, which promoting a new idea for the treatment of colon cancer.

Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 13 (PTPN13), has emerged as a critical cancer-related gene that is implicated in a wide range of cancer types. However, the role of PTPN13 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate whether PTPN13 participates in the progression of ccRCC. Decreased expression of PTPN13 was found in ccRCC tissues, which predicted a shorter survival rate in ccRCC patients. PTPN13 expression was also lower in ccRCC cell lines, and the upregulation of PTPN13 repressed the proliferation, colony formation and invasion, but enhanced the apoptosis of ccRCC cells. In contrast, the silencing of PTPN13 produced the opposite effects. Further data showed that PTPN13 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of Akt, while PTPN13 silencing increased the phosphorylation of Akt. Treatment with Akt inhibitor markedly abrogated the PTPN13 silencing-evoked oncogenic effect in ccRCC cells. Xenograft tumor experiments revealed that overexpression of PTPN13 remarkably restricted the tumor formation and growth of ccRCC cells in vivo associated with inactivation of Akt. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that overexpression of PTPN13 restricts the proliferation and invasion of ccRCC cells through inactivation of Akt. Our study suggests a tumor suppressive function of PTPN13 in ccRCC and highlights the potential role of PTPN13 in the progression of ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of protective mucosal T cell memory remains a formidable challenge to vaccinologists. Using a combination adjuvant strategy that elicits potent CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, we define the tenets of vaccine-induced pulmonary T cell immunity. An acrylic-acid-based adjuvant (ADJ), in combination with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA) or CpG, promotes mucosal imprinting but engages distinct transcription programs to drive different degrees of terminal differentiation and disparate polarization of TH1/TC1/TH17/TC17 effector/memory T cells. Combination of ADJ with GLA, but not CpG, dampens T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, mitigates terminal differentiation of effectors, and enhances the development of CD4 and CD8 TRM cells that protect against H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses. Mechanistically, vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells play a vital role in optimal programming of CD8 TRM and viral control. Taken together, these findings provide further insights into vaccine-induced multifaceted mucosal T cell immunity with implications in the development of vaccines against respiratorypathogens, including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: PD1/PDL1 pathway plays a critical role in cancer immune responses. The immune checkpoint inhibitors of PD1/PDL1 have been well explored and developed for immunotherapies of solid tumors. Recently, various monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway have emerged and achieved remarkable success in clinical trials. However, challenges with these monoclonal antibodies have appeared during cancer therapies, including predictors of response, patient selection, and innate resistance. Thus, a competitive antagonist of native PD1/PDL1, with smaller size and lower side-effect, is required for future cancer therapies. In this study, we utilized a protein evolution system of phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) to evolve PD1 continuously. Our results indicated that the newly evolved PD1 bound to PDL1 with higher affinity. The interactome analysis further suggested that these evolved PD1s exhibited higher specificity with PDL1. Therefore, these evolved PD1s may be applied as a new tool for tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Neural crest cells (NCCs) contribute to several tissues during embryonic development. NCC formation depends on activation of tightly regulated molecular programs at the neural plate border (NPB) region, which initiate NCC specification and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although several approaches to investigate NCCs have been devised, these early events of NCC formation remain largely unknown in humans, and currently available cellular models have not investigated EMT. Here, we report that the E6 neural induction protocol converts human induced pluripotent stem cells into NPB-like cells (NBCs), from which NCCs can be efficiently derived. NBC-to-NCC induction recapitulates gene expression dynamics associated with NCC specification and EMT, including downregulation of NPB factors and upregulation of NCC specifiers, coupled with other EMT-associated cell-state changes, such as cadherin modulation and activation of TWIST1 and other EMT inducers. This strategy will be useful in future basic or translational research focusing on these early steps of NCC formation.

Abstract: Summary
Sertoli cells are the major component of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) niche; however, regulatory mechanisms in Sertoli cells that dictate SSC fate decisions remain largely unknown. Here we revealed features of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification in Sertoli cells and demonstrated the functions of WTAP, the key subunit of the m6A methyltransferase complex in spermatogenesis. m6A-sequencing analysis identified 21,909 m6A sites from 15,365 putative m6A-enriched transcripts within 6,122 genes, including many Sertoli cell-specific genes. Conditional deletion of Wtap in Sertoli cells resulted in sterility and the progressive loss of the SSC population. RNA sequencing and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNA sequencing analyses suggested that alternative splicing events of transcripts encoding SSC niche factors were sharply altered and translation of these transcripts were severely dysregulated by Wtap deletion. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism of the SSC niche and provide insights into molecular interactions between stem cells and their cognate niches in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) species are opportunistic lung pathogens of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. While P. aeruginosa can initiate long-term infections in younger CF patients, Bcc infections only arise in teenagers and adults. Both P. aeruginosa and Bcc use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to mediate interbacterial competition. Here, we show P. aeruginosa isolates from teenage and adult CF patients, but not those from young CF patients, are outcompeted by the epidemic Bcc isolate Burkholderia cenocepacia strain AU1054 in a T6SS-dependent manner. The genomes of susceptible P. aeruginosa isolates harbor T6SS-abrogating mutations, the repair of which, in some cases, rendered the isolates resistant. Moreover, seven of eight Bcc strains outcompeted P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the same patients. Our findings suggest certain mutations that arise as P. aeruginosa adapts to the CF lung abrogate T6SS activity, making P. aeruginosa and its human host susceptible to potentially fatal Bcc superinfection.

Abstract: Many bone diseases result from abnormal bone resorption by osteoclasts (OCs). Studying OC related regulatory genes is necessary for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Rho GTPases have been proven to regulate OC differentiation and function and only mature OCs can carry out bone resorption. Here we demonstrate that Rac1 and Cdc42 exchange factor Triple functional domain (Trio) is critical for bone resorption caused by OCs. In this study, we created LysM-Cre;Triofl/fl conditional knockout mice in which Trio was conditionally ablated in monocytes. LysM-Cre;Triofl/fl mice showed increased bone mass due to impaired bone resorption caused by OCs. Furthermore, our in vitro analysis indicated that Trio conditional deficiency significantly suppressed OC differentiation and function. At the molecular level, Trio deficiency significantly inhibited the expression of genes critical for osteoclastogenesis and OC function. Mechanistically, our researches suggested that perturbed Rac1/Cdc42-PAK1-ERK/p38 signaling could be used to explain the lower ability of bone resorption in CKO mice. Taken together, this study indicates that Trio is a regulator of OCs. Studying the role of Trio in OCs provides a potential new insight for the treatment of OC related bone diseases.

Abstract: Lesion healing without treatment is a unique clinical characteristic of the early stages of syphilis infection. Angiogenesis, which involves endothelial cell migration, is an important process in wound healing. Tp0136, an outer membrane protein of T. pallidum, has the ability to bind host fibronectin-producing cells, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of syphilis. In this research, we purposed to analyze the role of Tp0136 in the migration of human microvascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells and to explore the related mechanism. First, Tp0136 significantly promoted HMEC-1 cell migration. Furthermore, the levels of C–C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA and protein expression rose with the concentration and time increasing of Tp0136. The migration of HMEC-1 cells was significantly suppressed by an anti-CCL2 antibody and a CCR2 (the CCL2 receptor) inhibitor. Further study revealed that, in cells pretreated with anti-fibronectin antibody, anti-integrin β1 antibody or RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), the expression levels of CCL2 induced by Tp0136 were notably decreased. Additionally, after pretreatment with an anti-fibronectin antibody, an anti-integrin β1 antibody or RGD, the migration of HMEC-1 cells treated with Tp0136 was obviously suppressed. These results show that Tp0136 promots the migration of HMEC-1 cells by inducing CCL2 expression via the interaction of the fibronectin RGD domain with integrin β1 and the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway, and these interactions may contribute to the mechanisms that increase the capacity for self-healing syphilis infection.

Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) regulates bile acid synthesis and attenuates bile acid-induced apoptosis via glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibition,

Abstract: Bile acid synthesis is restricted to hepatocytes and is rate-limited by CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α hydroxylase). CYP7A1 expression undergoes tight regulation and is repressed after partial hepatectomy to prevent the accumulation of toxic bile acids. Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) is a hepatotrophic factor shown to support liver regeneration by augmenting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Nevertheless, less is known about ALR's role in protecting hepatocytes from bile acid accumulation and bile acid-induced apoptosis. Therefore, HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were incubated with recombinant human ALR (rALR) and the expression of CYP7A1, bile acid-induced apoptosis as well as potential molecular mechanisms were analyzed. We found that rALR reduces CYP7A1 expression by increasing nuclear NFκB levels. Moreover, rALR reduced glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced-apoptosis by decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, which is regulated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation. Inhibitors for PI3K/Akt (GSK690693) and GSK3β (SB415286) confirmed the specificity of rALR treatment for this pathway. In addition, rALR reduces pro-death signaling by decreasing GCDC-induced JNK phosphorylation. Taken all together, rALR might contribute to protecting hepatocytes from toxic concentrations of bile acids by down-regulating their de novo synthesis, attenuating apoptosis by activation of PI3K/Akt - GSK3β pathway and inhibition of JNK signaling. Thereby this suggests a new role of ALR in augmenting the process of liver regeneration.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence has suggested that thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) is a novel tumor-related regulator that is aberrantly expressed in multiple tumors and contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Yet, little is known about the role of TRIP6 in cervical cancer. In the current study, we aimed to explore the expression, biological function, and regulatory mechanism of TRIP6 in cervical cancer. Here we showed that TRIP6 expression was markedly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. The knockdown of TRIP6 suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, and invasive potential of cervical cancer cells, whereas TRIP6 overexpression exhibited the opposite effect. Moreover, TRIP6 contributes to the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by downregulating the level of YAP phosphorylation. Notably, TRIP6-mediated tumor promotion effect was partially reversed by YAP inhibition. In addition, TRIP6 knockdown retarded the in vivo tumor growth of cervical cancer of mouse xenograft models associated with downregulation of YAP activation in tumor tissues. Taken together, these results reveal a potential tumor promotion role of TRIP6 that facilitates the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer through activation of YAP. Our study underlines the importance of the TRIP6/YAP axis in cervical cancer and suggests TRIP6 as a potential anticancer candidate for cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The systemic amyloidoses are diverse disorders in which misfolded proteins are secreted by effector organs and deposited as proteotoxic aggregates at downstream tissues. Although well described clinically, the contribution of synthesizing organs to amyloid disease pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we utilize hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to define the contribution of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) to the proteotoxicity of secreted transthyretin (TTR). To this end, we generated isogenic, patient-specific iPSCs expressing either amyloidogenic or wild-type TTR. We combined this tool with single-cell RNA sequencing to identify hepatic proteostasis factors correlating with destabilized TTR production in iPSC-derived HLCs. By generating an ATF6 inducible patient-specific iPSC line, we demonstrated that enhancing hepatic ER proteostasis preferentially reduces the secretion of amyloidogenic TTR. These data highlight the liver's capacity to chaperone misfolded TTR prior to deposition, and moreover suggest the potential for unfolded protein response modulating therapeutics in the treatment of diverse systemic amyloidoses.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and viral protein expression cause several epigenetic alterations that lead to cervical carcinogenesis. Our previous study identified that upregulated lysine-specific demethylase (KDM) 2 A promotes cervical cancer progression by inhibiting mircoRNA (miR)-132 function. However, the roles of histone methylation modifiers in HPV-related cervical cancer remain unclear. In the present study, changes in the expression of 48 histone methylation modifiers were assessed following knockdown of HPV16 E6/E7 in CaSki cells. The dysregulated expression of KDM5A was identified, and its function in cervical cancer was investigated in vitro and in vivo. E7 oncoprotein-induced upregulation of KDM5A promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo, which was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with cervical cancer. KDM5A was found to physically interact with the promoter region of miR-424–5p, and to suppress its expression by removing the tri- and di-methyl groups from H3K4 at the miR-424–5p locus. Furthermore, miR-424–5p repressed cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by targeting suppressor of zeste 12 (Suz12). KDM5A upregulation promoted cervical cancer progression by repressing miR-424–5p, which resulted in a decrease in Suz12. Therefore, KDM5A functions as a tumor activator in cervical cancer pathogenesis by binding to the miR-424–5p promoter and inhibiting its tumor-suppressive function. These results indicate a function for KDM5A in cervical cancer progression and suggest its candidacy as a novel prognostic biomarker and target for the clinical management of this malignancy.

Abstract: The developmental plasticity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is mainly controlled by well-characterized transcription factors, but additional factors, especially those related to metabolism that modulate this intrinsic program remain elusive. Here, using whole transcriptome analysis, we identified branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase-1(Bcat1) as highly-expressed in mouse ESCs and dramatically down-regulated upon differentiation. Bcat1 deletion impaired pluripotency and self-renewal in mouse ESCs, while Bcat1 overexpression resulted in robust ESC self-renewal and inhibition of differentiation. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis showed that Bcat1 deletion altered whole genome methylation levels and hence gene expression in multiple pathways. Specifically, Bcat1 deletion increased expression of RAS protein activator like 1(Rasal1), leading to inactivation of Ras-Erk/MAPK signaling, while Rasal1 inhibition rescued defects seen in Bcat1 deleted cells. In summary, we demonstrate that Bcat1 is essential for mouse ESC self-renewal and pluripotency and that this effect is mediated by DNA methylation and the Ras signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Plants benefit from associations with a diverse community of root-colonizing microbes. Deciphering the mechanisms underpinning these beneficial services are of interest for improving plant productivity. We report a plant-beneficial interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and the root microbiota under iron deprivation that is dependent on the secretion of plant-derived coumarins. Disrupting this pathway alters the microbiota and impairs plant growth in iron-limiting soil. Furthermore, the microbiota improves iron-limiting plant performance via a mechanism dependent on plant iron import and secretion of the coumarin fraxetin. This beneficial trait is strain specific yet functionally redundant across phylogenetic lineages of the microbiota. Transcriptomic and elemental analyses revealed that this interaction between commensals and coumarins promotes growth by relieving iron starvation. These results show that coumarins improve plant performance by eliciting microbe-assisted iron nutrition. We propose that the bacterial root microbiota, stimulated by secreted coumarins, is an integral mediator of plant adaptation to iron-limiting soils.

Abstract: Capn4, a small regulatory subunit of the calpain proteolytic system, functions as a potential tumor promoter in several cancers. However, the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of Capn4 in gastric cancer (GC) remain poorly understood. In the current study, we found that upregulation of Capn4 was detected frequently in GC tissues, and was associated with significantly worse survival among the GC patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that abundance of Capn4 was an independent predictive marker for the poor prognosis of GC. Further, Capn4 knockdown notably suppressed GC invasion and metastasis in vitro. Consistently, a xenograft assay showed that silencing of Capn4 in GC cells suppressed their dissemination to lung tissue in vivo. Moreover, our results indicated that Capn4 promotes gastric cancer metastasis by increasing MMP9 expression, and demonstrated that MMP9 is crucial for the pro-metastasis role of Capn4 in GC cells. Further investigation revealed that Capn4 regulated MMP9 expression via activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we found that Capn4 can decreased β-catenin ubiquitination to enhance the protein stability of β-catenin in GC cells. Collectively, Capn4 has a central role in gastric cancer metastasis, which could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for GC.

Abstract: DEAD-box (DDX) helicases are critical for recognizing viral nucleic acids to regulate antiviral innate immunity. Although DDX5 has been reported to participate in various virus infection, whether DDX5 regulates innate immune responses and its underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we report that DDX5 is a negative regulator of type I IFN (IFN–I) production in antiviral responses. DDX5 knockdown significantly promoted DNA or RNA virus infection-induced IFN-I production and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, while ectopic expression of DDX5 inhibited IFN-I production and promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found that DDX5 specifically interacted with serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2 A catalytic subunit beta (PP2A-Cβ) and viral infection enhanced the interaction between DDX5 and PP2A-Cβ. Besides, PP2A-Cβ interacted with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and PP2A-Cβ knockdown promoted viral infection-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-I production. In addition, DDX5 knockdown rendered the mice more resistant to viral infection and enhanced antiviral innate immunity in vivo. Thus, DDX5 suppresses IFN-I antiviral innate immune response by interacting with PP2A-Cβ to deactivate IRF3. Together, these findings identify a negative role of DDX5 on regulating IFN-I signaling in innate immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Among mammals, bats are particularly rich in zoonotic viruses, including flaviviruses. Certain bat species can be productively yet asymptomatically infected with viruses that cause overt disease in other species. However, little is known about the antiviral effector repertoire in bats relative to other mammals. Here, we report the black flying fox receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) as a potent interferon (IFN)-inducible inhibitor of human pathogens in the Flaviviridae family, including Zika, West Nile, and hepatitis C viruses. Mechanistically, RTP4 associates with the flavivirus replicase, binds viral RNA, and suppresses viral genome amplification. Comparative approaches revealed that RTP4 undergoes positive selection, that a flavivirus can mutate to escape RTP4-imposed restriction, and that diverse mammalian RTP4 orthologs exhibit striking patterns of specificity against distinct Flaviviridae members. Our findings reveal an antiviral mechanism that has likely adapted over 100 million years of mammalian evolution to accommodate unique host-virus genetic conflicts.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an invaluable resource for the study of human disease. However, there are no standardized methods for differentiation into hematopoietic cells, and there is a lack of robust, direct comparisons of different methodologies. In the current study we improved a feeder-free, serum-free method for generation of hematopoietic cells from iPSCs, and directly compared this with three other commonly used strategies with respect to efficiency, repeatability, hands-on time, and cost. We also investigated their capability and sensitivity to model genetic hematopoietic disorders in cells derived from Down syndrome and β-thalassemia patients. Of these methods, a multistep monolayer-based method incorporating aryl hydrocarbon receptor hyperactivation (“2D-multistep”) was the most efficient, generating significantly higher numbers of CD34+ progenitor cells and functional hematopoietic progenitors, while being the most time- and cost-effective and most accurately recapitulating phenotypes of Down syndrome and β-thalassemia.

Abstract: Summary
Swine influenza A viruses (swIAVs) can play a crucial role in the generation of new human pandemic viruses. In this study, in-depth passive surveillance comprising nearly 2,500 European swine holdings and more than 18,000 individual samples identified a year-round presence of up to four major swIAV lineages on more than 50% of farms surveilled. Phylogenetic analyses show that intensive reassortment with human pandemic A(H1N1)/2009 (H1pdm) virus produced an expanding and novel repertoire of at least 31 distinct swIAV genotypes and 12 distinct hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combinations with largely unknown consequences for virulence and host tropism. Several viral isolates were resistant to the human antiviral MxA protein, a prerequisite for zoonotic transmission and stable introduction into human populations. A pronounced antigenic variation was noted in swIAV, and several H1pdm lineages antigenically distinct from current seasonal human H1pdm co-circulate in swine. Thus, European swine populations represent reservoirs for emerging IAV strains with zoonotic and, possibly, pre-pandemic potential.

Abstract: Mechanobiological responses by osteoblasts are governed by downstream Rho-ROCK signalling through actin cytoskeleton re-arrangements but whether these responses are influenced by estrogen deficiency during osteoporosis remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine alterations in the mechanobiological responses of estrogen-deficient osteoblasts and investigate whether an inhibitor of the Rho-ROCK signalling can revert these changes. MC3T3-E1 cells were pre-treated with 10 nM 17-β estradiol for 7 days and further cultured with or without estradiol for next 2 days. These cells were treated with or without ROCK-II inhibitor, Y-27632, and oscillatory fluid flow (OFF, 1Pa, 0.5 Hz, 1 h) was applied. Here, we report that Prostaglandin E2 release, Runt-related transcription factor 2 and Osteopontin gene expression were significantly enhanced in response to OFF in estrogen-deficient cells than in cells with estrogen (3.73 vs 1.63 pg/ng DNA; 13.5 vs 2.6 fold, 2.1 vs 0.4 fold respectively). Upon ROCK-II inhibition, these enhanced effects of estrogen deficiency were downregulated. OFF increased the fibril anisotropy in cells pre-treated with estrogen and this increase was suppressed upon ROCK-II inhibition. This study is the first to demonstrate altered mechanobiological responses by osteoblasts during early estrogen deficiency and that these responses to OFF can be suppressed upon ROCK inhibition.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous polypeptides expressed in all living organisms that participate in several basic cellular processes, including protein folding, from which their denomination as molecular chaperones originated. There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by aberrant accumulation of intrahepatic triglycerides and lipid droplets (LDs) in the liver cells, is becoming increasingly prevalent at an alarming rate worldwide. LDs can be consumed by either hydrolysis or autophagy, which is shown to be of importance in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. We have shown that deficiency of pleckstrin homology domain-containing casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1), a scaffold protein that interacts with various proteins in multiple signal pathways, in mice aggravates high-fat diet induced fatty liver. However, its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of CKIP-1 decreased dramatically in steatotic HepG2 cells induced by oleic acid (OA) treatment. Coincidently, hepatic autophagy was also dynamically regulated in steatotic HepG2 cells. In addition, overexpression of CKIP-1 activated autophagy by suppression of Akt/mTOR signaling, which in turn reduced lipid accumulation. Moreover, these phenomena were reversed in CKIP-1-shRNA transfected steatotic hepatocytes. To further evaluate the potential role of CKIP-1 in autophagy, we determined the level of autophagy related proteins in CKIP-1 knockout mice. These results supported our findings in vitro. In summary, we found CKIP-1 to be a positive regulator of hepatic autophagy and a promising therapeutic target for treatment of NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts can be directly converted into functional Leydig cells by transcription factors. However, the transgenic approach used in these studies raises safety concerns for its future application. Here, we report that fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed into Leydig-like cells by exposure to a combination of forskolin, 20α-hydroxycholesterol, luteinizing hormone, and SB431542. These chemical compound-induced Leydig-like cells (CiLCs) express steroidogenic genes and have a global gene expression profile similar to that of progenitor Leydig cells, although not identical. In addition, these cells can survive in testis and produce testosterone in a circadian rhythm. This induction strategy is applicable to reprogramming human periodontal ligament fibroblasts toward Leydig-like cells. These findings demonstrated fibroblasts can be directly converted into Leydig-like cells by pure chemical compounds. This strategy overcomes the limitations of conventional transgenic-based reprogramming and provides a simple, effective approach for Leydig cell-based therapy while simultaneously preserving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most severe microvascular complication of diabetes and a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. However, the treatment for DR is still limited. Our study aimed to explore the role of circular RNA_0002570 in DR. First, we predicted the potential microRNA and mRNA that could bind to circ_0002570 and identified the miR-1243 and angiomotin gene; then, we used RT-PCR and Western blot to measure their expression. Next, we evaluated the abilities of proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in vitro in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs) by CCK-8, transwell assay, and tube formation assay, respectively. To analyze the relationship among miR-1243, circ_0002570, and angiomotin, RNA pull-down and luciferase assay were performed. Our results showed that, in DR patients and high-glucose–induced hRMECs, miR-1243, circ_0002570, and angiomotin were all abnormally expressed. MiR-1243 could directly and competitively bind to both circ_0002570 and angiomotin mRNA to inhibit their expression. Moreover, circ_0002570 suppressed the abilities of proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in hRMECs induced by high glucose, which was dependent on miR-1243-angiomotin axis. Furthermore, circ_0002570 could upregulate angiomotin by targeting miR-1243 to mediate the dysfunction of hRMECs induced by high glucose. In conclusion, circ_0002570 might serve as a potential target for diagnosis and treatment for DR.

Abstract: We previously reported 18-month results post-injection of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in 10 patients with end-stage peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in critical limb ischemia (CLI) and candidates for amputation, secondary to long-standing diabetes and/or arteriosclerotic disease. We documented positive clinical outcomes demonstrating pain relief as a change in the Rutherford score, improvement of ankle-brachial ratios (ABI), complete healing of 6 critical-size ulcers and evidence of neovascularization to the foot by MRI-based angiography. We now report persistency of the effect 6 years post-procedure in five patients and 4 years post-procedure in four additional patients who remained asymptomatic until death due to cardiac causes (patient 3) and lost from the study (patient 1). The 10th patient died early in the study. All treated extremities remain asymptomatic with increased ambulation, no recurrence of ulceration, and doppler color flow imaging at various vascular levels of the extremity demonstrating persistent blood flow and the presence of pulses doppler waveforms in the treated foot. Despite the extent of the disease, the contralateral extremities have not worsened significantly and no new ulcerations have appeared in any of the patients. Collectively, these data demonstrate that SVF injections have a durable long-term benefit forestalling further progression of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that compromise its chloride channel activity. Here, we present a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate RNA splicing deficiency of CFTR with a small molecule. The 3,849 + 10 kb C>T is the most common splicing mutation in CF, creating a pseudo exon with premature stop codon. We reveal that the 3,849 + 10 kb C>T-induced CFTR pseudo exon is regulated by phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, and their functional inhibition by a CDC-like kinase inhibitor restores normal splicing of CFTR. Subsequent screening of our focused chemical library identified CaNDY as a rectifier of the aberrant splicing. CaNDY treatment restored normal splicing of CFTR with the 3,849 + 10 kb C>T in CF patient cells and functional CFTR protein expression in the CF model cells. Our findings open the door for mechanism-based personalized medicine for pseudo-exon-type genetic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
HeLo domain-containing mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a pseudokinase, mediates necroptotic cell death in animals. Here, we report the discovery of a conserved protein family across seed plants that structurally resembles vertebrate MLKL. The Arabidopsis genome encodes three MLKLs (AtMLKLs) with overlapping functions in disease resistance mediated by Toll-interleukin 1-receptor domain intracellular immune receptors (TNLs). The HeLo domain of AtMLKLs confers cell death activity but is dispensable for immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal a tetrameric configuration, in which the HeLo domain is buried, suggestive of an auto-repressed complex. The mobility of AtMLKL1 along microtubules is reduced by chitin, a fungal immunity-triggering molecule. An AtMLKL1 phosphomimetic variant exhibiting reduced mobility enhances immunity. Coupled with the predicted presence of HeLo domains in plant helper NLRs, our data reveal the importance of HeLo domain proteins for TNL-dependent immunity and argue for a cell death-independent immune mechanism mediated by MLKLs.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the intrinsic specification of postnatal cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) and to what extent they depend on information from their local niche. Here, we have used an adapted cell preparation of isolated postnatal NSCs and live imaging to demonstrate that cerebellar progenitors maintain their neurogenic nature by displaying hallmarks of NSCs. Furthermore, by using this preparation, all the cell types produced postnatally in the cerebellum, in similar relative proportions to those observed in vivo, can be monitored. The fact that neurogenesis occurs in such organized manner in the absence of signals from the local environment, suggests that cerebellar lineage progression is to an important extent governed by cell-intrinsic or pre-programmed events. Finally, we took advantage of the absence of the niche to assay the influence of the vesicular nucleotide transporter inhibition, which dramatically reduced the number of NSCs in vitro by promoting their progression toward neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) patients treated with CSF3/G-CSF to alleviate neutropenia frequently develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A common pattern of leukemic transformation involves the appearance of hematopoietic clones with CSF3 receptor (CSF3R) mutations in the neutropenic phase, followed by mutations in RUNX1 before AML becomes overt. To investigate how the combination of CSF3 therapy and CSF3R and RUNX1 mutations contributes to AML development, we make use of mouse models, SCN-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and SCN and SCN-AML patient samples. CSF3 provokes a hyper-proliferative state in CSF3R/RUNX1 mutant hematopoietic progenitors but does not cause overt AML. Intriguingly, an additional acquired driver mutation in Cxxc4 causes elevated CXXC4 and reduced TET2 protein levels in murine AML samples. Expression of multiple pro-inflammatory pathways is elevated in mouse AML and human SCN-AML, suggesting that inflammation driven by downregulation of TET2 activity is a critical step in the malignant transformation of SCN.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2 is thought to result from both an inflammation-dominated cytokine response and virus-induced cell perturbation causing cell death. Here, we employ an integrative imaging analysis to determine morphological organelle alterations induced in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cells. We report 3D electron microscopy reconstructions of whole cells and subcellular compartments, revealing extensive fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, alteration of the mitochondrial network and recruitment of peroxisomes to viral replication organelles formed by clusters of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). These are tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum, providing insights into DMV biogenesis and spatial coordination of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Live cell imaging combined with an infection sensor reveals profound remodeling of cytoskeleton elements. Pharmacological inhibition of their dynamics suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication. We thus report insights into virus-induced cytopathic effects and provide alongside a comprehensive publicly available repository of 3D datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells for download and smooth online visualization.
