Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells display significant heterogeneity in gene expression, but whether this diversity is an inherent feature of the pluripotent state remains unknown. Single-cell gene expression analysis in cell subsets defined by surface antigen expression revealed that human embryonic stem cell cultures exist as a continuum of cell states, even under defined conditions that drive self-renewal. The majority of the population expressed canonical pluripotency transcription factors and could differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. A minority subpopulation of cells displayed high self-renewal capacity, consistently high transcripts for all pluripotency-related genes studied, and no lineage priming. This subpopulation was characterized by its expression of a particular set of intercellular signaling molecules whose genes shared common regulatory features. Our data support a model of an inherently metastable self-renewing population that gives rise to a continuum of intermediate pluripotent states, which ultimately become primed for lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
There is no consensus in the stem cell field as to what constitutes the mature cardiac myocyte. Thus, helping formalize a molecular signature for cardiac myocyte maturation would advance the field. In the mammalian heart, inactivation of the “fetal” TNNI gene, TNNI1 (ssTnI), together in temporal concert with its stoichiometric replacement by the adult TNNI gene product, TNNI3 (cTnI), represents a quantifiable ratiometric maturation signature. We examined the TNNI isoform transition in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and found the fetal TNNI signature, even during long-term culture. Rodent stem cell-derived and primary myocytes, however, transitioned to the adult TnI profile. Acute genetic engineering of hiPSC-CMs enabled a rapid conversion toward the mature TnI profile. While there is no single marker to denote the mature cardiac myocyte, we propose that tracking the cTnI:ssTnI protein isoform ratio provides a valuable maturation signature to quantify myocyte maturation status across laboratories.

Abstract: The ubiquitin proteasome system is central to the regulation of a number of intracellular sorting pathways in mammalian cells including quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum and the internalization and endosomal sorting of cell surface receptors. Here we describe that RNF126, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in the sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). In cells transiently depleted of RNF126, the CI-MPR is dispersed into Rab4 positive endosomes and the efficiency of retrograde sorting is delayed. Furthermore, the stable knockdown of RNF126 leads to the lysosomal degradation of CI-MPR and missorting of cathepsin D. RNF126 specifically regulates the sorting of the CI-MPR as other cargo that follow the retrograde sorting route including the cholera toxin, furin and TGN38 are unaffected in the absence of RNF126. Lastly we show that the RING finger domain of RNF126 is required to rescue the decrease in CI-MPR levels, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF126 is required for CI-MPR sorting. Together, our data indicate that the ubiquitin ligase RNF126 has a role in the retrograde sorting of the CI-MPR

Abstract: We earlier identified OSBP-related protein 8 (ORP8) as an endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope oxysterol-binding protein implicated in cellular lipid homeostasis, migration, and organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Here, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified Homo sapiens sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5)/Astrin as interaction partner of ORP8. The putative interaction was further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. ORP8 did not colocalize with kinetochore-associated SPAG5 in mitotic HepG2 or HuH7 cells, but overexpressed ORP8 was capable of recruiting SPAG5 onto endoplasmic reticulum membranes in interphase cells. In our experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) retarded the HepG2 cell cycle, causing accumulation in G2/M phase; ORP8 overexpression resulted in the same phenotype. Importantly, ORP8 knock-down dramatically inhibited the oxysterol effect on HepG2 cell cycle, suggesting a mediating role of ORP8. Furthermore, knock-down of SPAG5 significantly reduced the effects of both ORP8 overexpression and 25OHC on the cell cycle, placing SPAG5 downstream of the two cell-cycle interfering factors. Taken together, the present results suggest that ORP8 may via SPAG5 mediate oxysterol interference of the HepG2 cell cycle.

Abstract: Pancreatic Lgr5 expression has been associated with organoid-forming epithelial progenitor populations but the identity of the organoid-initiating epithelial cell subpopulation has remained elusive. Injury causes the emergence of an Lgr5+ organoid-forming epithelial progenitor population in the adult mouse liver and pancreas. Here, we define the origin of organoid-initiating cells from mouse pancreas and liver prior to Lgr5 activation. This clonogenic population was defined as MIC1-1C3+/CD133+/CD26− in both tissues and the frequency of organoid initiation within this population was approximately 5% in each case. The transcriptomes of these populations overlapped extensively and showed enrichment of epithelial progenitor-associated regulatory genes such as Sox9 and FoxJ1. Surprisingly, pancreatic organoid cells also had the capacity to generate hepatocyte-like cells upon transplantation to Fah−/− mice, indicating a differentiation capacity similar to hepatic organoids. Although spontaneous endocrine differentiation of pancreatic progenitors was not observed in culture, adenoviral delivery of fate-specifying factors Pdx1, Neurog3 and MafA induced insulin expression without glucagon or somatostatin. Pancreatic organoid cultures therefore preserve many key attributes of progenitor cells while allowing unlimited expansion, facilitating the study of fate determination.

Abstract: The physiological agonist norepinephrine promotes cell proliferation of brown preadipocytes during the process of tissue recruitment. In a primary culture system, cAMP mediates these adrenergic effects. In the present study, we demonstrated that, in contrast to other systems where the mitogenic effect of cAMP requires the synergistic action of (serum) growth factors, especially insulin/IGF, the cAMP effect in brown preadipocytes was independent of serum and insulin. Protein kinase A, rather than Epac, mediated the cAMP mitogenic effect. The Erk 1/2 family of MAPK, the PI3K system and the mTOR complexes were all activated by cAMP, but these activations were not necessary for cAMP-induced cell proliferation; a protein kinase C isoform may be involved in mediating cAMP-activated cell proliferation. We conclude that the generally acknowledged cellular mediators for induction of cell proliferation are not involved in this process in the brown preadipocyte system; this conclusion may be of relevance both for examination of mechanisms for induction of brown adipose tissue recruitment but also for understanding the mechanism behind e.g. certain endocrine neoplasias.

Abstract: Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly conserved molecular chaperone found in all species except for Archaea, which is required not only for stress tolerance but also for normal development. Recently, it was reported that HSP83, one member of the cytosolic HSP90 family, contributes to oogenesis and responds to heat resistance in Tribolium castaneum. Here, a novel ER-based HSP90 gene, Tchsp90, has been identified in T. castaneum. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hsp90s and hsp83s evolved separately from a common ancestor but that hsp90s originated earlier. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction illustrated that Tchsp90 is expressed in all developmental stages and is highly expressed at early pupa and late adult stages. Tchsp90 was upregulated in response to heat stress but not to cold stress. Laval RNAi revealed that Tchsp90 is important for larval/pupal development. Meanwhile, parental RNAi indicated that it completely inhibited female fecundity and partially inhibited male fertility once Tchsp90 was knocked down and that it will further shorten the lifespan of T. castaneum. These results suggest that Tchsp90 is essential for development, lifespan, and reproduction in T. castaneum in addition to its response to heat stress.

Abstract: Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker important for epithelial homeostasis. However, the position of the Lrig1+ population in the intestinal crypt has been debated, largely due to discrepant staining patterns using two Lrig1 antibodies. Here, we set out to decipher the differences between these Lrig1 antibodies to clarify their use for Lrig1-related studies. We confirmed that the commercially available Lrig1-R&D antibody stained the bottom third of the colonic crypt, whereas an independently generated Lrig1-VU antibody recognized a subset of anti-Lrig1-R&D+ cells. Biochemically, we found that anti-Lrig1-VU recognized a non-glycosylated form of Lrig1; in contrast, anti-Lrig1-R&D recognized both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of Lrig1. In addition, we generated a reporter mouse (Lrig1-Apple) as an independent readout of Lrig1 transcriptional activity. Flow cytometry of isolated colonic epithelial cells from Lrig1-Apple mice demonstrated anti-Lrig1-R&D recognized mostly RFP-hi cells, while anti-Lrig1-VU recognized cells that were largely RFP-mid. Of note, by qRT-PCR, Lgr5 was expressed in the RFP-hi population, but not in the RFP-mid population. We conclude that anti-Lrig1-R&D appears to recognize all Lrig1+ cells, while anti-Lrig1-VU recognizes a subpopulation of Lrig1+ cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) are essential regulators of cell death and immunity. The corresponding contributions of IAPs to infectious disease outcomes are relatively unexplored. We find that mice deficient in cIAP2 exhibit increased susceptibility and mortality to influenza A virus infection. The lethality was not due to impaired antiviral immune functions, but rather because of death-receptor-induced programmed necrosis of airway epithelial cells that led to severe bronchiole epithelial degeneration, despite control of viral replication. Pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 or genetic deletion of Ripk3, both kinases involved in programmed necrosis, rescued cIAP2-deficient mice from influenza-induced lethality. Genetic deletion of the death receptor agonists Fas ligand or TRAIL from the hematopoietic compartment also reversed the susceptibility of cIAP2-deficient mice. Thus, cIAP2-dependent antagonism of RIPK3-mediated programmed necrosis critically protects the host from influenza infection through maintenance of pulmonary tissue homeostasis rather than through pathogen control by the immune system.

Nef Proteins of Epidemic HIV-1 Group O Strains Antagonize Human Tetherin,

Abstract: Summary
Most simian immunodeficiency viruses use their Nef protein to antagonize the host restriction factor tetherin. A deletion in human tetherin confers Nef resistance, representing a hurdle to successful zoonotic transmission. HIV-1 group M evolved to utilize the viral protein U (Vpu) to counteract tetherin. Although HIV-1 group O has spread epidemically in humans, it has not evolved a Vpu-based tetherin antagonism. Here we show that HIV-1 group O Nef targets a region adjacent to this deletion to inhibit transport of human tetherin to the cell surface, enhances virion release, and increases viral resistance to inhibition by interferon-α. The Nef protein of the inferred common ancestor of group O viruses is also active against human tetherin. Thus, Nef-mediated antagonism of human tetherin evolved prior to the spread of HIV-1 group O and likely facilitated secondary virus transmission. Our results may explain the epidemic spread of HIV-1 group O.

Abstract: Summary
The myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are interferon-induced dynamin GTPases that can inhibit a variety of viruses. Recently, MxB, but not MxA, was shown to restrict HIV-1 by an unknown mechanism that likely occurs in close proximity to the host cell nucleus and involves the viral capsid. Here, we present the crystal structure of MxB and reveal determinants involved in HIV-1 restriction. MxB adopts an extended antiparallel dimer and dimerization, but not higher-ordered oligomerization, is critical for restriction. Although MxB is structurally similar to MxA, the orientation of individual domains differs between MxA and MxB, and their antiviral functions rely on separate determinants, indicating distinct mechanisms for virus inhibition. Additionally, MxB directly binds the HIV-1 capsid, and this interaction depends on dimerization and the N terminus of MxB as well as the assembled capsid lattice. These insights establish a framework for understanding the mechanism by which MxB restricts HIV-1.

Abstract: Summary
Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are in vitro equivalents to the precursor cells of the placenta. TSCs are cultured in serum-rich medium with fibroblast growth factor 4, heparin, and embryonic-fibroblast-conditioned medium. Here, we developed a simple medium consisting of ten chemically defined ingredients for culture of TSCs on Matrigel or synthetic substrates, named TX medium. Gene expression and DNA methylation profiling demonstrated the faithful propagation of expression profiles and epigenomic characteristics of TSCs cultured in TX. Further, TX medium supported the de novo derivation of TSC lines. Finally, TSCs cultured in TX differentiate into all derivatives of the trophectodermal lineage in vitro, give rise to hemorrhagic lesions in nude mice, and chimerize the placenta, indicating that they retained all hallmarks of TSCs. TX media formulation no longer requires fetal bovine serum and conditioned medium, which facilitates and standardizes the culture of this extraembryonic lineage.

Abstract: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are extensively used over the counter to treat headaches and inflammation as well as clinically to prevent cancer among high-risk groups. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity by NSAIDs plays a role in their anti-tumorigenic properties. NSAIDs also have COX-independent activity which is not fully understood. In this study, we report a novel COX-independent mechanism of sulindac sulfide (SS), which facilitates a previously uncharacterized cleavage of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) protein. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has been implemented as an over-expressed oncogene in many cancers including colon, breast, pancreas, and prostate. We found EpCAM to be down-regulated by SS in a manner that is independent of COX activity, transcription regulation, de novo protein synthesis, and proteasomal degradation pathway. Our findings clearly demonstrate that SS drives cleavage of the extracellular portion of EpCAM near the N-terminus. This SS driven cleavage is blocked by a deleting amino acids 55–81 as well as simply mutating arginine residues at positions 80 and 81 to alanine of EpCAM. Proteolysis of EpCAM by SS may provide a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs affect anti-tumorigenesis at the post-translational level.

Abstract: Vascularization is critical for 3D tissue engineered constructs. In large size implants the ingrowth of vessels often fails. The purpose of this study was to identify an easily accessible, clinically relevant cell source able to promote neovascularization in engineered implants in vivo and to establish an autologous culture method for these cells. MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) and an endothelial progenitor containing cell (EPCC) population were obtained from human bone marrow aspirates. The expression of endothelial-markers, uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) and tube-like structure formation capability of EPCCs were analyzed after expansion in endothelial growth medium or medium supplemented with autologous platelet lysate (PL). EPCCs were co-seeded with MSCs on hydroxyapatite-containing polyurethane scaffolds and then implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. Human EPCCs displayed typical characteristics of endothelial cells including uptake of acLDL and formation of tube-like structures on Matrigel™. In vivo, EPCCs cultured with PL triggered neovascularization. MSC/EPCC interactions promoted the maturation of newly formed luminal structures, which were detected deep within the scaffold and partly perfused, demonstrating a connection with the host vascular system. We demonstrate that this population of cells, isolated in a clinically relevant manner and cultured with autologous growth factors readily promoted neovascularization in tissue engineered constructs in vivo enabling a potential translation into the clinic.

Abstract: The Wnt gene family consists of structurally related genes encoding secreted signaling molecules that have been implicated in many developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. Previously, we found that Wnt signaling is required for primitive or yolk sac-derived-erythropoiesis using the murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) system. Here, we examine the effect of Wnt signaling on the formation of early hematopoietic progenitors derived from human ESCs. The first hematopoietic progenitor cells in the human ESC system express the pan-hematopoietic marker CD41 and the erythrocyte marker, glycophorin A or CD235. We have developed a novel serum-free, feeder-free, adherent differentiation system that can efficiently generate large numbers of CD41+CD235+ cells. We demonstrate that this cell population contains progenitors not just for primitive erythroid and megakaryocyte cells but for the myeloid lineage as well and term this population the primitive common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Treatment of mesoderm-specified cells with Wnt3a led to a loss of hematopoietic colony-forming ability while the inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling with DKK1 led to an increase in the number of primitive CMPs. Canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits the expansion and/or survival of primitive erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, but not myeloid cells, derived from this progenitor population. These findings are in contrast to the role of Wnt signaling during mouse ESC differentiation and demonstrate the importance of the human ESC system in studying species-specific differences in development.

Abstract: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) acts as a regulator of cellular signaling and may promote cell spreading, motility, invasion and survival in malignancy. Elevated expression and activity of FAK frequently correlate with tumor cell metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer. However, the mechanisms by which the turnover of FAK is regulated remain elusive. Here we report that heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) interacts with FAK and the middle domain (amino acids 233–620) of HSP90β is mainly responsible for this interaction. Furthermore, we found that HSP90β regulates FAK stability since HSP90β inhibitor 17-AAG triggers FAK ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. Moreover, disrupted FAK-HSP90β interaction induced by 17-AAG contributes to attenuation of tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion. Together, our results reveal how HSP90β regulates FAK stability and identifies a potential therapeutic strategy to breast cancer.

Abstract: Humans are systemically exposed to persistent organic pollutants, of which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has become a major environmental concern. Exposure to TCDD results in a wide variety of adverse health effects which is mediated by oxidative stress through CYP1A1 activation and arachidonic acid metabolites. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) exhibits antioxidant property and competes with arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids and produces anti-inflammatory EPA derivatives. Since both EPA and its derivatives have been reported to enhance the antioxidant mechanism, the present study aimed at studying whether EPA could offer protection against TCDD-induced oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats. Estimation of kidney markers (serum urea and creatinine) and histopathological studies revealed that EPA treatment significantly reduced TCDD-induced renal damage. TCDD-induced oxidative damage was reflected in a significant increase in CYP1A1 activity and lipid peroxide levels with a concomitant decline in non-enzymic antioxidant (GSH) and various enzymic antioxidants such catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). In addition, TCDD-induced oxidative stress also resulted in decline in Na+-K+ and Mg2+ATPases activities with increase in Ca2+ ATPases activity. Oral treatment with EPA showed a significant cytoprotection against TCDD-induced renal oxidative stress by decreased CYP1A1 activity and enhanced antioxidant status. TCDD-induced alterations in ATPase enzyme activities were also prevented by EPA treatment. Our results show clear evidence that EPA ameliorates TCDD-induced oxidative stress and kidney damage; thus suggest the potential of EPA as an effective therapeutic agent against toxic effects mediated through redox imbalance.

Abstract: Summary
Therapeutic approaches for “sick sinus syndrome” rely on electrical pacemakers, which lack hormone responsiveness and bear hazards such as infection and battery failure. These issues may be overcome via “biological pacemakers” derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Here, we show that forward programming of PSCs with the nodal cell inducer TBX3 plus an additional Myh6-promoter-based antibiotic selection leads to cardiomyocyte aggregates consisting of >80% physiologically and pharmacologically functional pacemaker cells. These induced sinoatrial bodies (iSABs) exhibited highly increased beating rates (300–400 bpm), coming close to those found in mouse hearts, and were able to robustly pace myocardium ex vivo. Our study introduces iSABs as highly pure, functional nodal tissue that is derived from PSCs and may be important for future cell therapies and drug testing in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires protein secretion systems like ESX-1 for intracellular survival and virulence. The major virulence determinant and ESX-1 substrate, EsxA, arrests phagosome maturation and lyses cell membranes, resulting in tissue damage and necrosis that promotes pathogen spread. To identify inhibitors of Mtb protein secretion, we developed a fibroblast survival assay exploiting this phenotype and selected molecules that protect host cells from Mtb-induced lysis without being bactericidal in vitro. Hit compounds blocked EsxA secretion and promoted phagosome maturation in macrophages, thus reducing bacterial loads. Target identification studies led to the discovery of BTP15, a benzothiophene inhibitor of the histidine kinase MprB that indirectly regulates ESX-1, and BBH7, a benzyloxybenzylidene-hydrazine compound. BBH7 affects Mtb metal-ion homeostasis and revealed zinc stress as an activating signal for EsxA secretion. This screening approach extends the target spectrum of small molecule libraries and will help tackle the mounting problem of antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria.

Abstract: Hyaluronan is a ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan involved in embryonic development, inflammation and cancer. In mammals, three hyaluronan synthase isoenzymes (HAS1-3) inserted in the plasma membrane produce hyaluronan directly on cell surface. The mRNA level and enzymatic activity of HAS1 are lower than those of HAS2 and HAS3 in many cells, obscuring the importance of HAS1. Here we demonstrate using immunocytochemistry and transfection of fluorescently tagged HAS1 that its enzymatic activity depends on the ER–Golgi–plasma membrane traffic, like reported for HAS2 and HAS3. When cultured in 5mM glucose, HAS1-transfected MCF-7 cells show very little cell surface hyaluronan, detected with a fluorescent hyaluronan binding probe. However, a large hyaluronan coat was seen in cells grown in 20mM glucose and 1mM glucosamine, or treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, or TGF-β. The coats were mostly removed by the presence of hyaluronan hexasaccharides, or Hermes1 antibody, indicating that they depended on the CD44 receptor, which is in a contrast to the coat produced by HAS3, remaining attached to HAS3 itself. The findings suggest that HAS1-dependent coat is induced by inflammatory agents and glycemic stress, mediated by altered presentation of either CD44 or hyaluronan, and can offer a rapid cellular response to injury and inflammation.

Abstract: The 70-kDa family of heat-shock proteins (Hsp70) plays an important role in the host immunity, which is widely expressed in eukaryotic cells as a major chaperone protein. In the present study, the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of a second cognate cytosolic Hsp70 family member (MnHsc70-2) was cloned and characterized from Macrobrachium nipponense, which is an economically and nutritionally important crustacean. The cDNA was 2,717 bp, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,950 bp, which encodes a protein of 649 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 71.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.27. Sequence alignment showed that the MnHsc70-2 shared 75–97 % identity with other heat-shock proteins. Compared to the previously identified cognate Hsp70 (MnHsc70-1) in M. nipponense, MnHsc70-2 showed quite different expression profiles under unstressed conditions in all tested tissues, including the hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, intestine, nerve, and muscle. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that MnHsc70-2 showed the closest relationship with MnHsc70-1. Heat-inducibility assays showed that two isolated messenger RNAs (mRNAs) displayed different expression profiles in both the hepatopancreas and gill tissues. MnHsc70-1 mRNA expression level decreased at first and then increased to the normal level, whereas MnHsc70-2 mRNA level increased at first and then decreased. The expressions of two MnHsc70s showed substantial obvious heat-inducible regulation in both the hepatopancreas and gill. Under bacterial challenge by Aeromonas hydrophila, both MnHsc70-1 and MnHsc70-2 mRNA level was up-regulated moderately. The results suggested that two cognate Hsc70s may play essential functions in mediating responses to heat-shock and bacterial challenge.

Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the switch between the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory states of endothelial cells are still poorly understood. In this paper, we show that: (a) COX-2 expression induced by VEGF-A is NFAT2-dependent; and (b) the integrin profile in endothelial cells induced by the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A is distinct from that brought on by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Two groups of integrin subunits specifically upregulated over time by both cytokines were identified using RT-PCR and Western Immunoblotting. The first group included α4, α5, α6, and β5 subunits that were upregulated by VEGF-A; the second group consisted of αV and β3 induced by TNF-α. Both cytokines significantly enhanced the expression of β1 and modulated α2 mRNA. In contrast to TNF-α, VEGF-A induction of integrin subunits depended on the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Both calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporineA and 11R-VIVIT) and downregulation of NFAT2 with specific siRNA decreased induction of integrin subunits. This process of induction could be increased by upregulation of NFAT2 by pBJ5-NFAT2 transfection. This suggests that NFAT2 mediates VEGF-induced upregulation of integrin subunit synthesis by providing a constant supply of newly synthesized “refreshed” mature integrin receptors, particularly α2β1, α5β1, α4β1, α6β1 and αVβ5, which are involved at different stages of angiogenesis.

Abstract: Accumulation of excess hepatic lipids contributes to insulin resistance and liver disease associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Exendin-4 is an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and plays a role in improving insulin resistance and liver disease by increasing silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT) 1. However, the effects and mechanism of action of exendin-4 on responses to palmitic acid (PA)-induced ER stress in hepatocytes have not been clearly defined. We investigated whether exendin-4 attenuates PA-induced ER stress via SIRT1 in HepG2 cells. PA treatment induced increased expression of PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositol-requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA. Exendin-4 decreased the expression of P-IRE1α, ATF6, X-box binding protein-1 and CHOP, and increased the expression of SERCA2b. A significant decrease in the hepatic expression of PUMA, BAX, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3 were observed in hepatocytes treated with exendin-4. The TUNEL assay consistently showed that exendin-4 reversed hepatocyte apoptosis induced by treatment with PA. Inhibition of SIRT1 by nicotinamide and siRNA significantly increased the expression of ER stress marker genes in cells treated with both PA and exendin-4. In conclusion, increased SIRT1 by exendin-4 attenuates PA-induced ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Clonally variant expression of surface antigens allows the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to evade immune recognition during blood stage infection and secure malaria transmission. We demonstrate that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heritable gene silencing, controls expression of numerous P. falciparum virulence genes as well as differentiation into the sexual forms that transmit to mosquitoes. Conditional depletion of P. falciparum HP1 (PfHP1) prevents mitotic proliferation of blood stage parasites and disrupts mutually exclusive expression and antigenic variation of the major virulence factor PfEMP1. Additionally, PfHP1-dependent regulation of PfAP2-G, a transcription factor required for gametocyte conversion, controls the switch from asexual proliferation to sexual differentiation, providing insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying gametocyte commitment. These findings show that PfHP1 is centrally involved in clonally variant gene expression and sexual differentiation in P. falciparum and have major implications for developing antidisease and transmission-blocking interventions against malaria.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are attractive therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), characterized by aberrant formation of protein aggregates. Although motor neurons have a high threshold for activation of HSP genes, HSP90 inhibitors are effective inducers. This study evaluated NXD30001, a novel, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor based on the radicicol backbone, for its ability to induce neuronal HSPs and for efficacy in an experimental model of ALS based on mutations in superoxide-dismutase 1 (SOD1). In motor neurons of dissociated murine spinal cord cultures, NXD30001-induced expression of HSP70/HSPA1 (iHSP70) and its co-chaperone HSP40/DNAJ through activation of HSF1 and exhibited a protective profile against SOD1G93A similar to geldanamycin, but with less toxicity. Treatment prevented protein aggregation, mitochondrial fragmentation, and motor neuron death, important features of mutant SOD1 toxicity, but did not effectively prevent aberrant intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. NXD30001 distributed to brain and spinal cord of wild-type and SOD1G93A transgenic mice following intraperitoneal injection; however, unlike in culture, in vivo levels of SOD1 were not reduced. NXD30001-induced expression of iHSP70 in skeletal and cardiac muscle and, to a lesser extent, in kidney, but not in liver, spinal cord, or brain, with either single or repeated administration. NXD30001 is a very useful experimental tool in culture, but these data point to the complex nature of HSP gene regulation in vivo and the necessity for early evaluation of the efficacy of novel HSP inducers in target tissues in vivo.

Human TREX2 components PCID2 and centrin 2, but not ENY2, have distinct functions in protein export and co-localize to the centrosome,

Abstract: TREX-2 is a five protein complex, conserved from yeast to humans, involved in linking mRNA transcription and export. The centrin 2 subunit of TREX-2 is also a component of the centrosome and is additionally involved in a distinctly different process of nuclear protein export. While centrin 2 is a known multifunctional protein, the roles of other human TREX-2 complex proteins other than mRNA export are not known. In this study, we found that human TREX-2 member PCID2 but not ENY2 is involved in some of the same cellular processes as those of centrin 2 apart from the classical TREX-2 function. PCID2 is present at the centrosome in a subset of HeLa cells and this localization is centrin 2 dependent. Furthermore, the presence of PCID2 at the centrosome is prevalent throughout the cell cycle as determined by co-staining with cyclins E, A and B. PCID2 but not ENY2 is also involved in protein export. Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of PCID2 delayed the rate of nuclear protein export, a mechanism distinct from the effects of centrin 2, which when knocked down inhibits export. Finally we showed that co-depletion of centrin 2 and PCID2 leads to blocking rather than delaying nuclear protein export, indicating the dominance of the centrin 2 phenotype. Together these results represent the first discovery of specific novel functions for PCID2 other than mRNA export and suggest that components of the TREX-2 complex serve alternative shared roles in the regulation of nuclear transport and cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Tetherin (BST2/CD317) restricts the release of enveloped viral particles from infected cells. Coupled to this virion retention, hominid tetherins induce proinflammatory gene expression via activating NF-κB. We investigated the events initiating this tetherin-induced signaling and show that physical retention of retroviral particles induces the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of tetherin dimers. This phosphorylation induces the recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is required for downstream NF-κB activation, indicating that the tetherin cytoplasmic tail resembles the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (hemITAMs) found in C-type lectin pattern recognition receptors. Retroviral-induced tetherin signaling is coupled to the cortical actin cytoskeleton via the Rac-GAP-containing protein RICH2 (ARHGAP44), and a naturally occurring tetherin polymorphism with reduced RICH2 binding exhibits decreased phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. Thus, upon virion retention, this linkage to the actin cytoskeleton likely triggers tetherin phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction to induce an antiviral state.

Abstract: Summary
Planarians can regenerate any missing body part in a process requiring dividing cells called neoblasts. Historically, neoblasts have largely been considered a homogeneous stem cell population. Most studies, however, analyzed neoblasts at the population rather than the single-cell level, leaving the degree of heterogeneity in this population unresolved. We combined RNA sequencing of neoblasts from wounded planarians with expression screening and identified 33 transcription factors transcribed in specific differentiated cells and in small fractions of neoblasts during regeneration. Many neoblast subsets expressing distinct tissue-associated transcription factors were present, suggesting candidate specification into many lineages. Consistent with this possibility, klf, pax3/7, and FoxA were required for the differentiation of cintillo-expressing sensory neurons, dopamine-β-hydroxylase-expressing neurons, and the pharynx, respectively. Together, these results suggest that specification of cell fate for most-to-all regenerative lineages occurs within neoblasts, with regenerative cells of blastemas being generated from a highly heterogeneous collection of lineage-specified neoblasts.

Abstract: The ability to extract somatic cells from a patient and reprogram them to pluripotency opens up new possibilities for personalized medicine. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been employed to generate beating cardiomyocytes from a patient's skin or blood cells. Here, iPSC methods were used to generate cardiomyocytes starting from the urine of a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Urine was chosen as a starting material because it contains adult stem cells called urine-derived stem cells (USCs). USCs express the canonical reprogramming factors c-myc and klf4, and possess high telomerase activity. Pluripotency of urine-derived iPSC clones was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and teratoma formation. Urine-derived iPSC clones generated from healthy volunteers and a DMD patient were differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes using a series of small molecules in monolayer culture. Results indicate that cardiomyocytes retain the DMD patient's dystrophin mutation. Physiological assays suggest that dystrophin-deficient cardiomyocytes possess phenotypic differences from normal cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating cardiomyocytes from a urine sample and that urine-derived cardiomyocytes retain characteristic features that might be further exploited for mechanistic studies and drug discovery.

Abstract: Although the differentiation of melanoblasts to melanocytes is known to depend on many distinct factors, it is still poorly understood which factors lead to the induction of melanoblasts. To determine which factors might induce melanoblasts, we examined a set of candidate factors for their ability to induce expression of MITF, a master regulator of melanoblast development, in an ES cell-based melanocyte differentiation system. It appears that BMP4 is capable of inducing MITF expression in stem cells. In contrast, a number of other factors normally implicated in the development of the melanocyte lineage, including WNT1, WNT3a, SCF, EDN3, IGF1, PDGF, and RA, cannot induce MITF expression. Nevertheless, BMP4 alone does not allow MITF-expressing precursors to become differentiated melanocytes, but the addition of EDN3 further promotes differentiation of the precursors into mature melanocytes. Our results support a model in which BMP4 induces MITF expression in pluripotent stem cells and EDN3 subsequently promotes differentiation of these MITF expressing cells along the melanocyte lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible protein phosphorylation regulated by kinases and phosphatases controls many cellular processes. Although essential functions for the malaria parasite kinome have been reported, the roles of most protein phosphatases (PPs) during Plasmodium development are unknown. We report a functional analysis of the Plasmodium berghei protein phosphatome, which exhibits high conservation with the P. falciparum phosphatome and comprises 30 predicted PPs with differential and distinct expression patterns during various stages of the life cycle. Gene disruption analysis of P. berghei PPs reveals that half of the genes are likely essential for asexual blood stage development, whereas six are required for sexual development/sporogony in mosquitoes. Phenotypic screening coupled with transcriptome sequencing unveiled morphological changes and altered gene expression in deletion mutants of two N-myristoylated PPs. These findings provide systematic functional analyses of PPs in Plasmodium, identify how phosphatases regulate parasite development and differentiation, and can inform the identification of drug targets for malaria.

Abstract: In musculoskeletal tissues like bone, chemotherapy can impair progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation, resulting in decreased bone growth and mineralization throughout a patient׳s lifetime. In the current study, we investigated the effects of chemotherapeutics on adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) function to determine whether this cell source could be a candidate for repairing, or even preventing, chemotherapy-induced tissue damage. Dose-dependent proliferation rates of ASCs and normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) were quantified after treatment with cytarabine (CY), etoposide (ETO), methotrexate (MTX), and vincristine (VIN) using a fluorescence-based assay. The influence of MTX on the multipotency of ASCs and freshly isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells was also evaluated using lineage-specific stains and spectrophotometry. ASC and NHF proliferation were equally inhibited by exposure to CY and ETO; however, when treated with MTX and VIN, ASCs exhibited greater resistance. This was especially apparent for MTX-treated samples, with ASC proliferation showing no inhibition for clinically relevant MTX doses ranging from 0.1 to 50μM. Additional experiments revealed that the differentiation potential of ASCs was not affected by MTX treatment and that upregulation of dihydrofolate reductase possibly contributed to this response. Moreover, SVF cells, which include ASCs, exhibited similar resistance to MTX impairment, with respect to cellular proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation capability. Therefore, we have shown that the regenerative properties of ASCs resist the cytotoxicity of MTX, identifying these cells as a potential key for repairing musculoskeletal damage in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling plays an integral role in skeletal development. Conditional deletion of the TGF-β type II receptor (Tgfbr2) from type II Collagen (Col2a) expressing cells results in defects in development of the annulus fibrosus (AF) of the intervertebral disc (IVD). We previously used microarray analysis to search for marker genes of AF as well as transcription factors regulated by TGF-β during AF development. The transcription factor avian erythroblastosis virus E-26 (v-ets) oncogene related (Erg) was identified in the microarray screen as a candidate regulator of AF development. To study the effects of TGF-β on AF differentiation and the role of Erg in this process, we used mouse sclerotome grown in micromass cultures. At 0.5ng TGF-β/ml, sclerotome cells started to express markers of AF. Regulation of Erg by TGF-β was confirmed in these cells. In addition, TGF-β soaked Affi-gel beads implanted into the axial skeleton of stage HH 25 chick embryos showed that TGF-β could induce expression of Erg mRNA in vivo. Next, an adenovirus to over-express Erg in primary sclerotome micromass cultures was generated. Over-expression of Erg led to a change in cell morphology and inhibition of differentiation into hyaline cartilage as seen by reduced Alcian blue staining and decreased Sox9 and c-Maf expression. Erg was not sufficient to induce expression of AF markers and expression of Sca1, a marker of pluripotent progenitor cells, was up-regulated in Erg expressing cells. When cells that ectopically expressed Erg were treated with TGF-β, enhanced expression of specific differentiation markers was observed suggesting Erg can cooperate with TGF-β to regulate differentiation of the sclerotome. Furthermore, we showed using co-immunopreciptiation that Erg and Smad3 bind to each other suggesting a mechanism for their functional interaction.

Abstract: Bioactive compounds are considered safe and have been shown to alter genetic and epigenetic profiles of tumor cells. However, many of these changes have been reported at molecular concentrations higher than physiologically achievable levels. We investigated the role of the combinatorial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a predominant polyphenol in green tea, and sodium butyrate (NaB), a dietary microbial fermentation product of fiber, in the regulation of survivin, which is an overexpressed anti-apoptotic protein in colon cancer cells. For the first time, our study showed that the combination treatment induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in RKO, HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. This was found to be regulated by the decrease in HDAC1, DNMT1, survivin and HDAC activity in all three cell lines. A G2/M arrest was observed for RKO and HCT-116 cells, and G1 arrest for HT-29 colorectal cancer cells for combinatorial treatment. Further experimentation of the molecular mechanisms in RKO colorectal cancer (CRC) cells revealed a p53-dependent induction of p21 and an increase in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-p65. An increase in double strand breaks as determined by gamma-H2A histone family member X (γ-H2AX) protein levels and induction of histone H3 hyperacetylation was also observed with the combination treatment. Further, we observed a decrease in global CpG methylation. Taken together, these findings suggest that at low and physiologically achievable concentrations, combinatorial EGCG and NaB are effective in promoting apoptosis, inducing cell cycle arrest and DNA-damage in CRC cells.

Abstract: Fibrosis is one of the most serious side effects in cancer patients undergoing radio-/ chemo-therapy, especially of the lung, pancreas or kidney. Based on our previous finding that galectin-1 (Gal-1) was significantly increased during radiation-induced lung fibrosis in areas of pulmonary fibrosis, we herein clarified the roles and action mechanisms of Gal-1 during fibrosis. Our results revealed that treatment with TGF-β1 induced the differentiation of fibroblast cell lines (NIH3T3 and IMR-90) to myofibroblasts, as evidenced by increased expression of the fibrotic markers smooth muscle actin-alpha (α-SMA), fibronectin, and collagen (Col-1). We also observed marked and time-dependent increases in the expression level and nuclear accumulation of Gal-1. The TGF-β1-induced increases in Gal-1, α-SMA and Col-1 were decreased by inhibitors of PI3-kinase and p38 MAPK, but not ERK. Gal-1 knockdown using shRNA decreased the phosphorylation and nuclear retention of Smad2, preventing the differentiation of fibroblasts. Gal-1 interacted with Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2, which may accelerate fibrotic processes. In addition, up-regulation of Gal-1 expression was demonstrated in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model of lung fibrosis in vivo. Together, our results indicate that Gal-1 may promote the TGF-β1-induced differentiation of fibroblasts by sustaining nuclear localization of Smad2, and could be a potential target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: 3-Methylcholanthrene (3MC) induces tumor formation at the site of injection in the hind leg of mice within 110 days. Recent reports reveal that the transformation of normal muscle cells to atypical cells is one of the causes for tumor formation, however the molecular mechanism behind this process is not well understood. Here, we show in an in vitro study that 3MC induces fragmentation of multinucleate myotubes into viable mononucleates. These mononucleates form colonies when they are seeded into soft agar, indicative of cellular transformation. Immunoblot analysis reveals that phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC20) is 5.6±0.5 fold reduced in 3MC treated myotubes in comparison to vehicle treated myotubes during the fragmentation of myotubes. In contrast, levels of myogenic factors such as MyoD, Myogenin and cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D, Cyclin E1 remain unchanged as assessed by real-time PCR array and reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, respectively. Interestingly, addition of the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-7, enhances the fragmentation, whereas phosphatase inhibitor perturbs the 3MC induced fragmentation of myotubes. These results suggest that decrease in RLC20 phosphorylation may be associated with the fragmentation step of dedifferentiation.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are among the most important components of the osteosarcoma microenvironment and are reported to promote tumor progression. However, the means by which osteosarcoma cells modulate MSC behavior remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of osteosarcoma cells on both the production of pro-tumor cytokines by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. High level of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was detected in three osteosarcoma cell lines. Conditioned media (CM) from the osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 and U2-OS were used to stimulate the cultured MSCs. We found that osteosarcoma cells promoted the production of IL-6 and VEGF in MSCs by inhibiting their osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, TGF-β in tumor CM was proved to be an important factor. The TGF-β neutralizing antibody antagonized the effects induced by osteosarcoma CM. The inhibition of Smad2/3 by siRNA significantly decreased the production of IL-6 and VEGF in MSCs and induced their osteogenic differentiation. We also found that Smad2/3 enhanced the expression of β-catenin in MSCs by decreasing the level of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). Although the inhibition of β-catenin did not affect the production of IL-6 or VEGF, or the gene expression of the early osteogenic markers Runx2 and ALP, it did enhance the gene expression of osteocalcin. Taken together, our data indicate that osteosarcoma cells secrete TGF-β to maintain the stemness of MSCs and promote the production of pro-tumor cytokines by these cells.

Abstract: The gap junction proteins connexin32 (Cx32), Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 are expressed in endothelial cells, and regulate vascular functions involving inflammation, vasculogenesis and vascular remodeling. Aberrant Cxs expression promotes the development of atherosclerosis which is modulated by angiogenesis; however the role played by endothelial Cxs in angiogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we determined the effects of endothelial Cxs, particularly Cx32, on angiogenesis. EA.hy926 cells that had been transfected to overexpress Cx32 significantly increased capillary length and the number on branches compared to Cx-transfectant cells over-expressing Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 or mock-treated cells. Treatment via intracellular transfer of anti-Cx32 antibody suppressed tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared to controls. In vitro wound healing assays revealed that Cx32-transfectant cells significantly increased the repaired area while anti-Cx32 antibody-treated HUVECs reduced it. Ex vivo aorta ring assays and in vivo matrigel plaque assays showed that Cx32-deficient mice impaired both vascular sprouting from the aorta and cell migration into the implanted matrigel. Therefore endothelial Cx32 facilitates tube formation, wound healing, vascular sprouting, and cell migration. Our results suggest that endothelial Cx32 positively regulates angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell tube formation and cell migration.

Abstract: Embryonic stem (ES) cells are characterized by pluripotency, defined as the developmental potential to generate cell lineages derived from all three primary germ layers. In the past decade, great progress has been made on the cell culture conditions, transcription factor programs and intracellular signaling pathways that control both murine and human ES cell fates. ES cells of mouse vs. human origin have distinct culture conditions, responding to some tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in opposite ways. Previous work has implicated the Src family of non-receptor protein–tyrosine kinases in mouse ES cell self-renewal and differentiation. Seven members of the Src kinase family are expressed in mouse ES cells, and individual family members appear to play distinct roles in regulating their developmental fate. Both Hck and c-Yes are important in self-renewal, while c-Src activity alone is sufficient to induce differentiation. While these findings implicate Src-family kinase signaling in mouse ES cell renewal and differentiation, the role of this kinase family in human ES cells is largely unknown. Here, we explored Src-family kinase expression patterns and signaling in human ES cells during self-renewal and differentiation. Of the eleven Src-related kinases in the human genome, Fyn, c-Yes, c-Src, Lyn, Lck and Hck were expressed in H1, H7 and H9 hES cells, while Fgr, Blk, Srm, Brk, and Frk transcripts were not detected. Of these, c-Yes, Lyn, and Hck transcript levels remained constant in self-renewing human ES cells vs. differentiated EBs, while c-Src and Fyn showed a modest increase in expression as a function of differentiation. In contrast, Lck expression levels dropped dramatically as a function of EB differentiation. To assess the role of overall Src-family kinase activity in human ES cell differentiation, cultures were treated with inhibitors specific for the Src kinase family. Remarkably, human ES cells maintained in the presence of the potent Src-family kinase inhibitor A-419259 retained the morphology of domed, pluripotent colonies and continued to express the self-renewal marker TRA-1-60 despite culture under differentiation conditions. Taken together, these observations support a role for Src-family kinase signaling in the regulation of human ES cell fate, and suggest that the activities of individual Src-family members are required for the initiation of the differentiation program.

Abstract: MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are involved in regulating the response of cancer cells to various therapeutic interventions, but their involvement in the chemoresistance of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma is not fully understood. We found miR-181a was significantly up-regulated in specimens from patients with chemoresistant cervical squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of miR-181a in regulating the chemoresistance of cervical cancer. Two human cervical squamous cancer cell lines, SiHa and Me180, were used. Enforced expression of miR-181a enhanced chemoresistance to cisplatin in cervical cancer cells through apoptosis reversion. In a nude mouse xenograft model, the overexpression of miR-181a markedly inhibited the therapeutic response to cisplatin. PRKCD, a target gene of miR-181a and a promoter of apoptosis, was negatively regulated by miR-181a. We found that the effect of miR-181a on chemoresistance was mediated by PRKCD. Additionally, silencing of PRKCD yielded an effect similar to that of miR-181a up-regulation and inhibited apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Our findings suggest that miR-181a may function as an oncogene and induce chemoresistance in cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells at least in part by down-regulating PRKCD, thus may provide a biomarker for predicting chemosensitivity to cisplatin in patients with cervical squamous cancer.

Abstract: Erythropoiesis is a tightly regulated process dependent on extrinsic signals conveyed by the bone marrow niche. The signalling pathways thus activated or repressed do not act in isolation; rather an intricate cross talk among these pathways ensues homoeostasis within the erythroid compartment. In this study, we describe the effects of two such signalling pathways namely the Notch1 and the Shh pathway on erythropoiesis in immortalised K562 and HEL cell lines as well as the cross talk that ensues between them. We show that while activation of the Notch1 pathway inhibits differentiation of erythroid lineage cell lines as well as in in-vitro primary erythroid cultures from the human CD34+ cells; Shh pathway favours erythroid differentiation. Further, the Notch1 pathway activates the Akt pathway and constitutively active Akt partially mimics the effect of Notch1 activation on erythropoiesis. Moreover, the Notch1, Akt and Shh pathways were found to cross talk with each other. In this process, activation of Notch1 was found to down regulate the Shh pathway independent of Akt activation. Significantly, Notch1 not only down regulated the Shh pathway, but also inhibited recombinant Shh mediated erythropoiesis. Our study thus reveals an intricate crosstalk among the Notch1, Shh and Akt pathways wherein Notch1 emerges as a key regulator of erythropoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for in vitro generation of disease-relevant cell types, such as mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons involved in Parkinson’s disease. Although iPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons have been generated, detailed genetic and epigenetic characterizations of such neurons are lacking. The goal of this study was to examine the authenticity of iPSC-derived DA neurons obtained by established protocols. We FACS purified mdDA (Pitx3Gfp/+) neurons derived from mouse iPSCs and primary mdDA (Pitx3Gfp/+) neurons to analyze and compare their genetic and epigenetic features. Although iPSC-derived DA neurons largely adopted characteristics of their in vivo counterparts, relevant deviations in global gene expression and DNA methylation were found. Hypermethylated genes, mainly involved in neurodevelopment and basic neuronal functions, consequently showed reduced expression levels. Such abnormalities should be addressed because they might affect unambiguous long-term functionality and hamper the potential of iPSC-derived DA neurons for in vitro disease modeling or cell-based therapy.

Abstract: ANKHD1 is a multiple ankyrin repeat containing protein, recently identified as a novel member of the Hippo signaling pathway. The present study aimed to investigate the role of ANKHD1 in DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. ANKHD1 and YAP1 were found to be highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, and ANKHD1 silencing decreased cell growth, delayed cell cycle progression at the S phase, and reduced tumor xenograft growth. Moreover, ANKHD1 knockdown downregulated YAP1 expression and activation, and reduced the expression of CCNA2, a YAP1 target gene. These findings indicate that ANKHD1 is a positive regulator of YAP1 and promotes cell growth and cell cycle progression through Cyclin A upregulation.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a hereditary renal disease caused by mutations in PKD1 (85%) or PKD2 (15%), is characterized by the development of gradually enlarging multiple renal cysts and progressive renal failure. Polycystin-1 (PC1), PKD1 gene product, is an integral membrane glycoprotein which regulates a number of different biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell polarity, and tubulogenesis. PC1 is a target of various proteolytic cleavages and proteosomal degradations, but its role in intracellular signaling pathways remains poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrated that PC1 is a novel substrate for μ- and m-calpains, which are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Overexpression of PC1 altered both Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signals, which were independently regulated by calpain-mediated PC1 degradation. They suggest that the PC1 function on JAK2 and ERK signaling pathways might be regulated by calpains in response to the changes in intracellular calcium concentration.

Abstract: Myosin 1e (myo1e) is an actin-based motor protein that has been implicated in cell adhesion and migration. We examined the role of myo1e in invadosomes, actin-rich adhesion structures that are important for degradation and invasion of the extracellular matrix. RSV-transformed BHK-21 cells, which readily form invadosomes and invadosome rosettes, were used as the experimental model. Myo1e localization to the actin-rich core of invadosomes required the proline-rich Tail Homology 2 (TH2) domain. During invadosome rosette expansion, we observed myo1e recruitment to newly forming invadosomes via Tail Homology 1 (TH1)-dependent interactions with the plasma membrane, where it preceded actin and paxillin. Dominant-negative inhibition of myo1e resulted in mislocalized invadosome formation, usually at the center of the rosette. We propose that TH2 domain of myo1e provides the key signal for localization to invadosomes, while TH1 domain interactions facilitate myo1e targeting to the plasma membrane-proximal locations within the rosettes. Myo1e may then act as a scaffold, linking the plasma membrane with the actin cytoskeleton and helping direct new invadosome formation to the periphery of the rosette.

Abstract: Adaptor protein c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2) is known to play regulatory roles in immunoreceptor-mediated signal transduction. We have previously demonstrated that Tyr174, Tyr183 and Tyr446 in mouse 3BP2 are predominantly phosphorylated by Syk, and the phosphorylation of Tyr183 and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of mouse 3BP2 are critical for B cell receptor (BCR)-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in human B cells. In this report, we have shown that Syk, but not Abl family protein-tyrosine kinases, is critical for BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2 in chicken DT40 cells. Mutational analysis showed that Tyr174, Tyr183 and Tyr426 of chicken 3BP2 are the major phosphorylation sites by Syk and the SH2 domain of 3BP2 is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, phosphorylation of Tyr426 is required for the inducible interaction with the SH2 domain of Vav3. Moreover, the expression of the mutant form of 3BP2 in which Tyr426 was substituted to Phe resulted in the reduction in BCR-mediated Rac1 activation, when compared with the case of wild-type. Altogether, these data suggest that 3BP2 is involved in the activation of Rac1 through the regulation of Vav3 by Syk-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr426 following BCR stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
The SWI/SNF complex plays an important role in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), but it remains to be determined whether this complex is required for the pluripotency of human ESCs (hESCs). Using RNAi, we demonstrated that depletion of BRG1, the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, led to impaired self-renewing ability and dysregulated lineage specification of hESCs. A unique composition of the BRG1-SWI/SNF complex in hESCs was further defined by the presence of BRG1, BAF250A, BAF170, BAF155, BAF53A, and BAF47. Genome-wide expression analyses revealed that BRG1 participated in a broad range of biological processes in hESCs through pathways different from those in mESCs. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that BRG1 played a repressive role in transcriptional regulation by modulating the acetylation levels of H3K27 at the enhancers of lineage-specific genes. Our data thus provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms by which transcriptional repression affects the self-renewal and differentiation of hESCs.

Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal disease, and precursor cells need to migrate into the multiple lesions in order to exert their therapeutic effects. Therefore, cell migration is a crucial element in regenerative processes in MS, dictating the route of delivery, when cell transplantation is considered. We have previously shown that inflammation triggers migration of multi-potential neural precursor cells (NPCs) into the white matter of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rodents, a widely used model of MS. Here we investigated the molecular basis of this attraction. NPCs were grown from E13 embryonic mouse brains and transplanted into the lateral cerebral ventricles of EAE mice. Transplanted NPC migration was directed by three tissue-derived chemokines. Stromal cell-derived factor-1α, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 and hepatocyte growth factor were expressed in the EAE brain and specifically in microglia and astrocytes. Their cognate receptors, CXCR4, CCR2 or c-Met were constitutively expressed on NPCs. Selective blockage of CXCR4, CCR2 or c-Met partially inhibited NPC migration in EAE brains. Blocking all three receptors had an additive effect and resulted in profound inhibition of NPC migration, as compared to extensive migration of control NPCs. The inflammation-triggered NPC migration into white matter tracts was dependent on a motile NPC phenotype. Specifically, depriving NPCs from epidermal growth factor (EGF) prevented the induction of glial commitment and a motile phenotype (as indicated by an in vitro motility assay), hampering their response to neuroinflammation. In conclusion, signaling via three chemokine systems accounts for most of the inflammation-induced, tissue-derived attraction of transplanted NPCs into white matter tracts during EAE.

Abstract: CTP synthase is an essential metabolic enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of CTP. Multiple studies have recently showed that CTP synthase protein molecules form filamentous structures termed cytoophidia or CTP synthase filaments in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, as well as in bacteria. Here we report that CTP synthase can form cytoophidia not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Both glutamine deprivation and glutamine analog treatment promote formation of cytoplasmic cytoophidia (C-cytoophidia) and nuclear cytoophidia (N-cytoophidia). N-cytoophidia are generally shorter and thinner than their cytoplasmic counterparts. In mammalian cells, both CTP synthase 1 and CTP synthase 2 can form cytoophidia. Using live imaging, we have observed that both C-cytoophidia and N-cytoophidia undergo multiple rounds of fusion upon glutamine analog treatment. Our study reveals the coexistence of cytoophidia in the cytoplasm and nucleus, therefore providing a good opportunity to investigate the intracellular compartmentation of CTP synthase.

Abstract: Currently there is intense interest in using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for therapeutic interventions in many diseases and conditions. To accelerate the therapeutic use of stem cells we must understand how they sense their environment. Primary cilia are an extracellular sensory organelle present on most growth arrested cells that transduce information about the cellular environment into cells, triggering signaling cascades that have profound effects on development, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and migration. Migrating cells likely encounter differing oxygen tensions, therefore we investigated the effect of oxygen tension on cilia. Using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) we found that oxygen tension significantly affected the length of cilia in primary BMSCs. Chronic exposure to hypoxia specifically down-regulated genes involved in hedgehog signaling and re-localized the Smo and Gli2 proteins to cilia. Investigating the effects of chemotactic migration on cilia, we observed significantly longer cilia in migrating cells which was again, strongly influenced by oxygen tension. Finally, using computational modeling we identified links between migration and ciliation signaling pathways, characterizing the novel role of HSP90 and PI3K signaling in regulating BMSC cilia length. These findings enhance our current understanding of BMSC adaptions to hypoxia and advance our knowledge of BMSC biology and cilia regulation.

Abstract: Organisms have evolved to survive rigorous environments and are not prepared to thrive in a world of caloric excess and sedentary behavior. A realization that physical exercise (or lack of it) plays a pivotal role in both the pathogenesis and therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2DM) has led to the provocative concept of therapeutic exercise mimetics. A decade ago, we attempted to simulate the beneficial effects of exercise by treating t2DM patients with 3 weeks of daily hyperthermia, induced by hot tub immersion. The short-term intervention had remarkable success, with a 1 % drop in HbA1, a trend toward weight loss, and improvement in diabetic neuropathic symptoms. An explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise and hyperthermia centers upon their ability to induce the cellular stress response (the heat shock response) and restore cellular homeostasis. Impaired stress response precedes major metabolic defects associated with t2DM and may be a near seminal event in the pathogenesis of the disease, tipping the balance from health into disease. Heat shock protein inducers share metabolic pathways associated with exercise with activation of AMPK, PGC1-a, and sirtuins. Diabetic therapies that induce the stress response, whether via heat, bioactive compounds, or genetic manipulation, improve or prevent all of the morbidities and comorbidities associated with the disease. The agents reduce insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokines, visceral adiposity, and body weight while increasing mitochondrial activity, normalizing membrane structure and lipid composition, and preserving organ function. Therapies restoring the stress response can re-tip the balance from disease into health and address the multifaceted defects associated with the disease.

Abstract: Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are highly responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including gefitinib and erlotinib, development of acquired resistance is almost inevitable. Statins show antitumor activity, but it is unknown whether they can reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC with the T790M mutation of EGFR. This study investigated overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKI using simvastatin. We demonstrated that addition of simvastatin to gefitinib enhanced caspase-dependent apoptosis in T790M mutant NSCLC cells. Simvastatin also strongly inhibited AKT activation, leading to suppression of β-catenin activity and the expression of its targets, survivin and cyclin D1. Both insulin treatment and AKT overexpression markedly increased p-β-catenin and survivin levels, even in the presence of gefitinib and simvastatin. However, inhibition of AKT by siRNA or LY294002 treatment decreased p-β-catenin and survivin levels. To determine the role of survivin in simvastatin-induced apoptosis of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC, we showed that the proportion of apoptotic cells following treatment with survivin siRNA and the gefitinib–simvastatin combination was greater than the theoretical additive effects, whereas survivin up-regulation could confer protection against gefitinib and simvastatin-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in erlotinib and simvastatin-treated HCC827/ER cells. These findings suggest that survivin is a key molecule that renders T790M mutant NSCLC cells resistant to apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs and simvastatin. Overall, these data indicate that simvastatin may overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in T790M mutant NSCLCs via an AKT/β-catenin signaling-dependent down-regulation of survivin and apoptosis induction.

Abstract: A series of signaling cascades are activated after angiotensin II binds to angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a peptide that is an important mediator of oxidative stress. Hsp70 regulates a diverse set of signaling pathways through interactions with proteins. Here, we tested the hypothesis of angiotensin II AT1R inhibition effect on Hsp70 interaction with Nox4/p22phox complex and Hsp70 leading to actin cytoskeleton modulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). SHR and Wistar–Kyotto rats (VSMCs from 8 to 10 weeks) were stimulated with angiotensin II (100 nmol/L) for 15 min (AII), treated with losartan (100 nmol/L) for 90 min (L), and with losartan for 90 min plus angiotensin in the last 15 min (L + AII). Whereas SHR VSMCs exposure to angiotensin II overexpressed AT1R and Nox4 nicotinamide–adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and slightly downregulated caveolin-1 expression, losartan decreased AT1R protein levels and increased caveolin-1 and Hsp70 expression in SHR VSMC membranes. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy proved interaction and colocalization of membrane translocated Hsp70 and Nox4/p22phox. Increased levels of Hsp70 contrast with the decreased immunoprecipitation of Nox4/p22phox and RhoA in membranes from SHR VSMCs (L) vs SHR VSMCs (AII). Hsp72 depletion resulted in higher Nox4 expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity in VSMCs (L + AII) from SHR when contrasted with nontransfected VSMCs (L + AII). After Hsp72 knockdown in SHR VSMCs, losartan could not impair angiotensin II-enhanced stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly. In conclusion, our data showing a negative regulation of Hsp70 on Nox4/p22phox demonstrates a possible mechanism in explaining the antioxidative function joined to cytoskeletal integrity modulation within the effects of losartan in VSMCs from SHR.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by the capacity for self-renewal and the ability to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic compartment. Thrombopoietin maintains adult HSCs in a quiescent state through the induction of cell cycle inhibitors p57Kip2 and p19INK4d. Using the p19INK4d−/− mouse model, we investigated the role of p19INK4d in basal and stress-induced hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that p19INK4d is involved in the regulation of HSC quiescence by inhibition of the G0/G1 cell cycle transition. Under genotoxic stress conditions, the absence of p19INK4d in HSCs leads to accelerated cell cycle exit, accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, and apoptosis when cells progress to the S/G2-M stages of the cell cycle. Moreover, p19INK4d controls the HSC microenvironment through negative regulation of megakaryopoiesis. Deletion of p19INK4d results in megakaryocyte hyperproliferation and increased transforming growth factor β1 secretion. This leads to fibrosis in the bone marrow and spleen, followed by loss of HSCs during aging.

Abstract: Understanding the role of Notch and its ligands within the different bone marrow niches could shed light on the mechanisms regulating haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) maintenance and self-renewal. Here, we report that murine bone marrow HPCs activation by the vascular Notch Delta-4 ligand maintains a significant proportion of cells specifically in the G0 state. Furthermore, Delta-4/Notch pathway limits significantly the loss of the in vivo short-term reconstitutive potential upon transplantation of Delta-4 activated HPCs into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Both effects are directly correlated with the decrease of cell cycle genes transcription such as CYCLIN-D1, -D2, and -D3, and the upregulation of stemness related genes transcription such as BMI1, GATA2, HOXB4 and C-MYC. In addition, the transcriptional screening also highlights new downstream post-transcriptional factors, named PUMILIO1 and -2, as part of the stem signature associated with the Delta-4/Notch signalling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 reverse transcription represents the predominant target for pharmacological inhibition of viral replication, but cell-intrinsic mechanisms that can block HIV-1 reverse transcription in a clinically significant way are poorly defined. We find that effective HIV-1 reverse transcription depends on the phosphorylation of viral reverse transcriptase by host cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 at a highly conserved Threonine residue. CDK2-dependent phosphorylation increased the efficacy and stability of viral reverse transcriptase and enhanced viral fitness. Interestingly, p21, a cell-intrinsic CDK inhibitor that is upregulated in CD4+ T cells from “elite controllers,” potently inhibited CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and significantly reduced the efficacy of viral reverse transcription. These data suggest that p21 can indirectly block HIV-1 reverse transcription by inhibiting host cofactors supporting HIV-1 replication and identify sites of viral vulnerability that are effectively targeted in persons with natural control of HIV-1 replication.

Abstract: AF1Q, a mixed lineage leukemia gene fusion partner, is identified as a poor prognostic biomarker for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), adult AML with normal cytogenetic and adult myelodysplastic syndrome. AF1Q is highly regulated during hematopoietic progenitor differentiation and development but its regulatory mechanism has not been defined clearly. In the present study, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches to influence chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and explored the degradation mechanism of AF1Q. Pharmacological inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, such as chloroquine, increased AF1Q levels, whereas activators of CMA, including 6-aminonicotinamide and nutrient starvation, decreased AF1Q levels. AF1Q interacts with HSPA8 and LAMP-2A, which are core components of the CMA machinery. Knockdown of HSPA8 or LAMP-2A increased AF1Q protein levels, whereas overexpression showed the opposite effect. Using an amino acid deletion AF1Q mutation plasmid, we identified that AF1Q had a KFERQ-like motif which was recognized by HSPA8 for CMA-dependent proteolysis. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that AF1Q can be degraded in lysosomes by CMA.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transplantation improves healing of injured and diseased skeletal muscle, although the mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether MSCs and/or their trophic factors were able to regulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity in different cells of the muscle tissue. MSCs in co-culture with C2C12 cells or their conditioned medium (MSC-CM) up-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and function in the myoblastic cells; these effects were concomitant with the down-regulation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and -2 and with increased cell motility. In the single muscle fiber experiments, MSC-CM administration increased MMP-2/9 expression in Pax-7+ satellite cells and stimulated their mobilization, differentiation and fusion. The anti-fibrotic properties of MSC-CM involved also the regulation of MMPs by skeletal fibroblasts and the inhibition of their differentiation into myofibroblasts. The treatment with SB-3CT, a potent MMP inhibitor, prevented in these cells, the decrease of α-smooth actin and type-I collagen expression induced by MSC-CM, suggesting that MSC-CM could attenuate the fibrogenic response through mechanisms mediated by MMPs. Our results indicate that growth factors and cytokines released by these cells may modulate the fibrotic response and improve the endogenous mechanisms of muscle repair/regeneration.

Abstract: In addition to being a very well-known ion pump, Na+, K+-ATPase is a cell–cell adhesion molecule and the receptor of digitalis, which transduces regulatory signals for cell adhesion, growth, apoptosis, motility and differentiation. Prolonged ouabain (OUA) blockage of activity of Na+, K+-ATPase leads to cell detachment from one another and from substrates. Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms involved in tight junction (TJ) disassembly upon exposure to toxic levels of OUA (≥300nM) in epithelial renal canine cells (MDCK). OUA induces a progressive decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER); inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, PD153035), cSrc (SU6656 and PP2) and ERK1/2 kinases (PD98059) delay this decrease. We have determined that the TER decrease depends upon internalization and degradation of the TJs proteins claudin (CLDN) 2, CLDN-4, occludin (OCLN) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). OUA-induced degradation of proteins is either sensitive (CLDN-4, OCLN and ZO-1) or insensitive (CLDN-2) to ERK1/2 inhibition. In agreement with the protein degradation findings, OUA decreases the cellular content of ZO-1 and CLDN-2 mRNAs but surprisingly, increases the mRNA of CLDN-4 and OCLN. Changes in the mRNA levels are sensitive (CLDN-4, OCLN and ZO-1) or insensitive (CLDN-2) to ERK1/2 inhibition as well. Thus, toxic levels of OUA activate the EGFR-cSrc-ERK1/2 pathway to induce endocytosis, internalization and degradation of TJ proteins. We also observed decreases in the levels of CLDN-2 protein and mRNA, which were independent of the EGFR-cSrc-ERK1/2 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cell banking, disease modeling, and cell therapy applications have placed increasing demands on hiPSC technology. Specifically, the high-throughput derivation of footprint-free hiPSCs and their expansion in systems that allow scaled production remains technically challenging. Here, we describe a platform for the rapid, parallel generation, selection, and expansion of hiPSCs using small molecule pathway inhibitors in stage-specific media compositions. The platform supported efficient and expedited episomal reprogramming using just OCT4/SOX2/SV40LT combination (0.5%–4.0%, between days 12 and 16) in a completely feeder-free environment. The resulting hiPSCs are transgene-free, readily cultured, and expanded as single cells while maintaining a homogeneous and genomically stable pluripotent population. hiPSCs generated or maintained in the media compositions described exhibit properties associated with the ground state of pluripotency. The simplicity and robustness of the system allow for the high-throughput generation and rapid expansion of a uniform hiPSC product that is applicable to industrial and clinical-grade use.

Abstract: DNMT3B is a de novo DNA methyltransferase that is highly expressed in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells and has been shown to be essential for differentiation of mouse ES cells toward different lineages. In the present study, we found that DNMT3B is rapidly down-regulated in human ES cells during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation compared with DNMT3A2, which is also highly expressed in ES cells. Silencing of DNMT3B in human ES cells by an inducible shRNAi system leads to a reduction of clonal ability of the stem cells, while expression of OCT4 and NANOG is unchanged. By contrast, the germline-specific genes VASA and SCP3 and the surface antigen BE12 are down regulated following DNMT3B knockdown. Upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation, we found that depletion of DNMT3B leads to a decrease in expression of the surface antigen A2B5 and of neural tube-associated genes PAX7 and BRN3A. Consistent with its importance in stem cell differentiation, we observed that silencing of DNMT3B facilitates the generation of cells that bear the hallmarks of pluripotency. Our findings suggest a role of DNMT3B in controlling the differentiation of human ES cells and in the generation of iPS cells.

Abstract: Summary
B-lymphocyte-induced nuclear maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) was previously reported to define a sebaceous gland (SG) progenitor population in the epidermis. However, the recent identification of multiple stem cell populations in the hair follicle junctional zone has led us to re-evaluate its function. We show, in agreement with previous studies, that BLIMP1 is expressed by postmitotic, terminally differentiated epidermal cells within the SG, interfollicular epidermis, and hair follicle. Epidermal overexpression of c-Myc results in loss of BLIMP1+ cells, an effect modulated by androgen signaling. Epidermal-specific deletion of Blimp1 causes multiple differentiation defects in the epidermis in addition to SG enlargement. In culture, BLIMP1+ sebocytes have no greater clonogenic potential than BLIMP1− sebocytes. Finally, lineage-tracing experiments reveal that, under steady-state conditions, BLIMP1-expressing cells do not divide. Thus, rather than defining a sebocyte progenitor population, BLIMP1 functions in terminally differentiated cells to maintain homeostasis in multiple epidermal compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Data from the literature indicate that genomic imprint marks are disturbed in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). GNAS is an imprinted locus that produces one biallelic (Gsα) and four monoallelic (NESP55, GNAS-AS1, XLsα, and A/B) transcripts due to differential methylation of their promoters (DMR). To document imprinting at the GNAS locus in PSCs, we studied GNAS locus DMR methylation and transcript (NESP55, XLsα, and A/B) expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from two human fibroblasts and their progenies. Results showed that (1) methylation at the GNAS locus DMRs is DMR and cell line specific, (2) changes in allelic transcript expression can be independent of a change in allele-specific DNA methylation, and (3) interestingly, methylation at A/B DMR is correlated with A/B transcript expression. These results indicate that these models are valuable to study the mechanisms controlling GNAS methylation, factors involved in transcript expression, and possibly mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral malaria is a complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection characterized by sudden coma, death, or neurodisability. Studies using a mouse model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) have indicated that blood-brain barrier disruption and CD8 T cell recruitment contribute to disease, but the spatiotemporal mechanisms are poorly understood. We show by ultra-high-field MRI and multiphoton microscopy that the olfactory bulb is physically and functionally damaged (loss of smell) by Plasmodium parasites during ECM. The trabecular small capillaries comprising the olfactory bulb show parasite accumulation and cell occlusion followed by microbleeding, events associated with high fever and cytokine storm. Specifically, the olfactory upregulates chemokine CCL21, and loss or functional blockade of its receptors CCR7 and CXCR3 results in decreased CD8 T cell activation and recruitment, respectively, as well as prolonged survival. Thus, early detection of olfaction loss and blockade of pathological cell recruitment may offer potential therapeutic strategies for ECM.

Abstract: Malignant tumors show intense glycolysis and, as a consequence, high lactate production and proton efflux activity. We investigated proton dynamics in osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma, and evaluated the effects of esomeprazole as a therapeutic agent interfering with tumor acidic microenvironment. All sarcomas were able to survive in an acidic microenvironment (up to 5.9–6.0 pH) and abundant acidic lysosomes were found in all sarcoma subtypes. V-ATPase, a proton pump that acidifies intracellular compartments and transports protons across the plasma membrane, was detected in all cell types with a histotype-specific expression pattern. Esomeprazole administration interfered with proton compartmentalization in acidic organelles and induced a significant dose-dependent toxicity. Among the different histotypes, rhabdomyosarcoma, expressing the highest levels of V-ATPase and whose lysosomes are most acidic, was mostly susceptible to ESOM treatment.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a critical role in inflammation and ulcerations in gut of Crohn׳s disease (CD) patients. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) secrete MMPs in response to inflammatory stimuli. Previous data showed in CD-ISEMFs increased oxidative status. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ISEMFs in modulating the production of MMP-3 and TIMP-1, an inhibitor of MMPs activity. A relationship among oxidative stress, activity of antioxidants and MMP-3/TIMP-1 was also studied. ISEMFs isolated from CD patient colon and human colonic cell line of myofibroblasts (18Co) were used. Oxidative state was modulated by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), GSH precursor. An up-regulation of MMP-3 due to increased oxidative state was found in CD-ISEMFs. Stimulation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α increased further MMP-3 levels. On the contrary, no change in TIMP-1 production was determined. NAC treatment decreased MMP-3 production in CD-ISMEFs and removed the enhancement due to TNFα. Similar effects were observed in 18Co cells treated with curcumin, antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties. The involvement of MAPKs on MMP-3 redox regulation was also shown. This study demonstrates the involvement of ISEMFs and high oxidative state in the increased MMP-3 production found in intestinal mucosa of CD patients. NAC and curcumin normalize MMP-3 levels mainly in TNFα stimulated cells. A modulation of MMP-3 production by NAC and curcumin due to their direct action on transcriptional factors has been also suggested. Therefore, they could have a therapeutic use for the prevention and treatment of fistulaes in CD.

Abstract: Land plants need precise thermosensors to timely establish molecular defenses in anticipation of upcoming noxious heat waves. The plasma membrane-embedded cyclic nucleotide-gated Ca2+ channels (CNGCs) can translate mild variations of membrane fluidity into an effective heat shock response, leading to the accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSP) that prevent heat damages in labile proteins and membranes. Here, we deleted by targeted mutagenesis the CNGCd gene in two Physcomitrella patens transgenic moss lines containing either the heat-inducible HSP-GUS reporter cassette or the constitutive UBI-Aequorin cassette. The stable CNGCd knockout mutation caused a hyper-thermosensitive moss phenotype, in which the heat-induced entry of apoplastic Ca2+ and the cytosolic accumulation of GUS were triggered at lower temperatures than in wild type. The combined effects of an artificial membrane fluidizer and elevated temperatures suggested that the gene products of CNGCd and CNGCb are paralogous subunits of Ca2+channels acting as a sensitive proteolipid thermocouple. Depending on the rate of temperature increase, the duration and intensity of the heat priming preconditions, terrestrial plants may thus acquire an array of HSP-based thermotolerance mechanisms against upcoming, otherwise lethal, extreme heat waves.

Abstract: Summary
Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a multipotent cell population that is capable of nearly indefinite expansion and subsequent differentiation into the various neuronal and supporting cell types that comprise the CNS. However, current protocols for differentiating NPCs toward neuronal lineages result in a mixture of neurons from various regions of the CNS. In this study, we determined that endogenous WNT signaling is a primary contributor to the heterogeneity observed in NPC cultures and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, exogenous manipulation of WNT signaling during neural differentiation, through either activation or inhibition, reduces this heterogeneity in NPC cultures, thereby promoting the formation of regionally homogeneous NPC and neuronal cultures. The ability to manipulate WNT signaling to generate regionally specific NPCs and neurons will be useful for studying human neural development and will greatly enhance the translational potential of hPSCs for neural-related therapies.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal toxicity is a common adverse effect of mycophenolic acid (MPA) treatment in organ transplant patients, through poorly understood mechanisms. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) is associated with epithelial tight junction (TJ) modulation which leads to defective epithelial barrier function, and has been implicated in GI diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MPA could induce epithelial barrier permeability via MLC2 regulation. Caco-2 monolayers were exposed to therapeutic concentrations of MPA, and MLC2 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) expression were analyzed using PCR and immunoblotting. Epithelial cell permeability was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER) and the flux of paracellular permeability marker FITC-dextran across the epithelial monolayers. MPA increased the expression of MLC2 and MLCK at both the transcriptional and translational levels. In addition, the amount of phosphorylated MLC2 was increased after MPA treatment. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed redistribution of TJ proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) after MPA treatment. This MPA mediated TJ disruption was not due to apoptosis or cell death. Additionally ML-7, a specific inhibitor of MLCK was able to reverse both the MPA mediated decrease in TER and the increase in FITC-dextran influx, suggesting a modulating role of MPA on epithelial barrier permeability via MLCK activity. These results suggest that MPA induced alterations in MLC2 phosphorylation and may have a role in the patho-physiology of intestinal epithelial barrier disruption and may be responsible for the adverse effects (GI toxicity) of MPA on the intestine.

Abstract: Rising temperatures are severely affecting the mortality, laying performance, and meat quality of duck. Our aim was to investigate the effect of acute heat stress on the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs: HSP90, 70, 60, 40, and 10) and inflammatory factors (nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)) and antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehybe (MDA), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC)) in livers of ducks and to compare the thermal tolerance of Pekin and Muscovy ducks exposed to acute heat stress. Ducks were exposed to heat at 39 ± 0.5°C for 1 h and then returned to 20°C for 1 h followed by a 3-h recovery period. The liver and other tissues were collected from each individual for analysis. The mRNA levels of HSPs (70, 60, and 40) increased in both species, except for HSP10, which was upregulated in Muscovy ducks and had no difference in Pekin ducks after heat stress. Simultaneously, the mRNA level of HSP90 decreased in the stress group in both species. Morphological analysis indicated that heat stress induced tissue injury in both species, and the liver of Pekin ducks was severely damaged. The activities of several antioxidant enzymes increased in Muscovy duck liver, but decreased in Pekin duck. The mRNA levels of inflammatory factors were increased after heat stress in both duck species. These results suggested that heat stress could influence HSPs, inflammatory factors expression, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, the differential response to heat stress indicated that the Muscovy duck has a better thermal tolerance than does the Pekin duck.

Abstract: Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches lead to protein aggregation and severe neurodegenerative diseases. A highly efficient suppressor of polyQ aggregation was identified, the DNAJB6, when molecular chaperones from the HSPH, HSPA, and DNAJ families were screened for huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cells (Hageman et al. in Mol Cell 37(3):355–369, 2010). Furthermore, also aggregation of polyQ peptides expressed in cells was recently found to be efficiently suppressed by co-expression of DNAJB6 (Gillis et al. in J Biol Chem 288:17225–17237, 2013). These suppression effects can be due to an indirect effect of DNAJB6 on other cellular components or to a direct interaction between DNAJB6 and polyQ peptides that may depend on other cellular components. Here, we have purified the DNAJB6 protein to investigate the suppression mechanism. The purified DNAJB6 protein formed large heterogeneous oligomers, in contrast to the more canonical family member DNAJB1 which is dimeric. Purified DNAJB6 protein, at substoichiometric molar ratios, efficiently suppressed fibrillation of polyQ peptides with 45°Q in a thioflavin T fibrillation. No suppression was obtained with DNAJB1, but with the closest homologue to DNAJB6, DNAJB8. The suppression effect was independent of HSPA1 and ATP. These data, based on purified proteins and controlled fibrillation in vitro, strongly suggest that the fibrillation suppression is due to a direct protein–protein interaction between the polyQ peptides and DNAJB6 and that the DNAJB6 has unique fibrillation suppression properties lacking in DNAJB1. Together, the data obtained in cells and in vitro support the view that DNAJB6 is a peptide-binding chaperone that can interact with polyQ peptides that are incompletely degraded by and released from the proteasome.

Abstract: The loss of genome integrity in adult stem cells results in accelerated tissue aging and is possibly cancerogenic. Adult stem cells in different tissues appear to react robustly to DNA damage. We report that adult skeletal stem (satellite) cells do not primarily respond to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via differentiation and exhibit less apoptosis compared to other myogenic cells. Satellite cells repair these DNA lesions more efficiently than their committed progeny. Importantly, non-proliferating satellite cells and post-mitotic nuclei in the fiber exhibit dramatically distinct repair efficiencies. Altogether, reduction of the repair capacity appears to be more a function of differentiation than of the proliferation status of the muscle cell. Notably, satellite cells retain a high efficiency of DSB repair also when isolated from the natural niche. Finally, we show that repair of DSB substrates is not only very efficient but, surprisingly, also very accurate in satellite cells and that accurate repair depends on the key non-homologous end-joining factor DNA-PKcs.

Abstract: Hypoxia affects many physiologic processes during early stages of mammalian ontogeny, particularly placental and vascular development. In the adult, the hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment plays a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. HSCs are generated from the major vasculature of the embryo, but whether the hypoxic response affects the generation of these HSCs is as yet unknown. Here we examined whether Hypoxia Inducible Factor1-alpha (HIF1α), a key modulator of the response to hypoxia, is essential for HSC development. We found hypoxic cells in embryonic tissues that generate and expand hematopoietic cells (aorta, placenta and fetal liver), and specifically aortic endothelial and hematopoietic cluster cells. A Cre/loxP conditional knockout (cKO) approach was taken to delete HIF1α in Vascular Endothelial-Cadherin expressing endothelial cells, the precursors to definitive hematopoietic cells. Functional assays show that HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are significantly reduced in cKO aorta and placenta. Moreover, decreases in phenotypic aortic hematopoietic cluster cells in cKO embryos indicate that HIF1α is necessary for generation and/or expansion of HPCs and HSCs. cKO adult BM HSCs are also affected under transplantation conditions. Thus, HIF1α is a regulator of HSC generation and function beginning at the earliest embryonic stages.

Abstract: The localization of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged HSP70 proteins was employed to identify stress-sensitive sites in human neurons following temperature elevation. Stable lines of human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were established that expressed YFP-tagged protein products of the human inducible HSP70 genes HSPA6 (HSP70B′) and HSPA1A (HSP70-1). Following a brief period of thermal stress, YFP-tagged HSPA6 and HSPA1A rapidly appeared at centrioles in the cytoplasm of human neuronal cells, with HSPA6 demonstrating a more prolonged signal compared to HSPA1A. Each centriole is composed of a distal end and a proximal end, the latter linking the centriole doublet. The YFP-tagged HSP70 proteins targeted the proximal end of centrioles (identified by γ-tubulin marker) rather than the distal end (centrin marker). Centrioles play key roles in cellular polarity and migration during neuronal differentiation. The proximal end of the centriole, which is involved in centriole stabilization, may be stress-sensitive in post-mitotic, differentiating human neurons.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of living cells are highly regulated by remodeling dynamics of the cytoarchitecture, and are linked to a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Microtubules (MT) and actomyosin contractility are both involved in regulating focal adhesion (FA) size and cortical elasticity in living cells. Although several studies have examined the effects of MT depolymerization or actomyosin activation on biological processes, very few have investigated the influence of both on the mechanical properties, FA assembly, and spreading of fibroblast cells. Here, we examine how activation of both processes modulates cortical elasticity as a function of time. Enhancement of contractility (calyculin A treatment) or the depolymerization of MTs (nocodazole treatment) individually caused a time-dependent increase in FA size, decrease in cell height and an increase in cortical elasticity. Surprisingly, sequentially stimulating both processes led to a decrease in cortical elasticity, loss of intact FAs and a concomitant increase in cell height. Our results demonstrate that loss of MTs disables the ability of fibroblast cells to maintain increased contractility and cortical elasticity upon activation of myosin-II. We speculate that in the absence of an intact MT network, a large amount of contractile tension is transmitted directly to FA sites resulting in their disassembly. This implies that tension-mediated FA growth may have an upper bound, beyond which disassembly takes place. The interplay between cytoskeletal remodeling and actomyosin contractility modulates FA size and cell height, leading to dynamic time-dependent changes in the cortical elasticity of fibroblast cells.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial infection can trigger autophagy and inflammasome activation, but the effects of inflammasome activation on autophagy are unknown. We examined this in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa macrophage infection, which triggers NLRC4 inflammasome activation. P. aeruginosa induced autophagy via TLR4 and its adaptor TRIF. NLRC4 and caspase-1 activation following infection attenuated autophagy. Caspase-1 directly cleaved TRIF to diminish TRIF-mediated signaling, resulting in inhibition of autophagy and in reduced type I interferon production. Expression of a caspase-1 resistant TRIF mutant enhanced autophagy and type I interferon production following infection. Preventing TRIF cleavage by caspase-1 in an in vivo model of P. aeruginosa infection resulted in enhanced bacterial autophagy, attenuated IL-1β production, and increased bacterial clearance. Additionally, TRIF cleavage by caspase-1 diminished NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, caspase-1 mediated TRIF cleavage is a key event in controlling autophagy, type I interferon production, and inflammasome activation with important functional consequences.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a role in supporting the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells in bone but inhibits their osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying EGF inhibition of osteoblast differentiation remains unclear. Smurf1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Smad1/5 and Runx2, which are critical transcription factors for bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effect of EGF on the expression of Smurf1, and the role of Smurf1 in EGF inhibition of osteogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells, a murine myoblast cell line. EGF increased Smurf1 expression, which was blocked by inhibiting the activity of either JNK or ERK. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and Smurf1 promoter assays demonstrated that c-Jun and Runx2 play roles in the EGF induction of Smurf1 transcription. EGF suppressed BMP2-induced expression of osteogenic marker genes, which were rescued by Smurf1 knockdown. EGF downregulated the protein levels of Runx2 and Smad1 in a proteasome-dependent manner. EGF decreased the transcriptional activity of Runx2 and Smurf1, which was partially rescued by Smurf1 silencing. Taken together, these results suggest that EGF increases Smurf1 expression via the activation of JNK and ERK and the subsequent binding of c-Jun and Runx2 to the Smurf1 promoter and that Smurf1 mediates the inhibitory effect of EGF on BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can provide a promising source of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons for cell replacement therapy for Parkinson’s disease. However, iPSC-derived donor cells inevitably contain tumorigenic or inappropriate cells. Here, we show that human iPSC-derived DA progenitor cells can be efficiently isolated by cell sorting using a floor plate marker, CORIN. We induced DA neurons using scalable culture conditions on human laminin fragment, and the sorted CORIN+ cells expressed the midbrain DA progenitor markers, FOXA2 and LMX1A. When transplanted into 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, the CORIN+ cells survived and differentiated into midbrain DA neurons in vivo, resulting in significant improvement of the motor behavior, without tumor formation. In particular, the CORIN+ cells in a NURR1+ cell-dominant stage exhibited the best survival and function as DA neurons. Our method is a favorable strategy in terms of scalability, safety, and efficiency and may be advantageous for clinical application.

Abstract: Summary
Degeneration of the knee joint during osteoarthritis often begins with meniscal lesions. Meniscectomy, previously performed extensively after meniscal injury, is now obsolete because of the inevitable osteoarthritis that occurs following this procedure. Clinically, meniscus self-renewal is well documented as long as the outer, vascularized meniscal ring remains intact. In contrast, regeneration of the inner, avascular meniscus does not occur. Here, we show that cartilage tissue harvested from the avascular inner human meniscus during the late stages of osteoarthritis harbors a unique progenitor cell population. These meniscus progenitor cells (MPCs) are clonogenic and multipotent and exhibit migratory activity. We also determined that MPCs are likely to be controlled by canonical transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling that leads to an increase in SOX9 and a decrease in RUNX2, thereby enhancing the chondrogenic potential of MPC. Therefore, our work is relevant for the development of novel cell biological, regenerative therapies for meniscus repair.

Abstract: Summary
Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are largely palliative, not curative. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) harbor regenerative and immunosuppressive functions, indicating a potential therapy for MS, yet the variability and low potency of MSCs from adult sources hinder their therapeutic potential. MSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hES-MSCs) may be better suited for clinical treatment of MS because of their unlimited and stable supply. Here, we show that hES-MSCs significantly reduce clinical symptoms and prevent neuronal demyelination in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model of MS, and that the EAE disease-modifying effect of hES-MSCs is significantly greater than that of human bone-marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). Our evidence also suggests that increased IL-6 expression by BM-MSCs contributes to the reduced anti-EAE therapeutic activity of these cells. A distinct ability to extravasate and migrate into inflamed CNS tissues may also be associated with the robust therapeutic effects of hES-MSCs on EAE.

Abstract: Vascular calcification can be categorized into two different types. Intimal calcification related to atherosclerosis and elastin-specific medial arterial calcification (MAC). Osteoblast-like differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been shown in both types; however, how this relates to initiation of vascular calcification is unclear. We hypothesize that the initial deposition of hydroxyapatite-like mineral in MAC occurs on degraded elastin first and that causes osteogenic transformation of VSMCs. To test this, rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were cultured on hydroxyapatite crystals and calcified aortic elastin. Using RT-PCR and specific protein assays, we demonstrate that RASMCs lose their smooth muscle lineage markers like alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) and undergo chondrogenic/osteogenic transformation. This is indicated by an increase in the expression of typical chondrogenic proteins such as aggrecan, collagen type II alpha 1(Col2a1) and bone proteins such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Furthermore, when calcified conditions are removed, cells return to their original phenotype. Our data supports the hypothesis that elastin degradation and calcification precedes VSMCs′ osteoblast-like differentiation.

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) can differentiate into multiple lineages including osteogenic and adipogenic cells. Wnt signalling has been implicated in controlling BMSC fate, but the mechanisms are unclear and apparently conflicting data exist. Here we show that a novel glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor, AR28, is a potent activator of canonical Wnt signalling using in vitro β-catenin translocation studies and TCF-reporter assays. In vivo, AR28 induced characteristic axis duplication and secondary regions of chordin expression in Xenopus laevis embryos. Using human BMSCs grown in adipogenic medium, we confirmed that AR28-mediated Wnt signalling caused a significant (p<0.05) dose-dependent reduction of adipogenic markers. In osteogenic media, including dexamethasone, AR28 caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to vehicle controls, indicative of a reduced osteogenic response. However, when excluding dexamethasone from the osteogenic media, increases in both ALP and mineralisation were identified following AR28 treatment, which was blocked by mitomycin C. Pre-treatment of BMSCs with AR28 for 7days before osteogenic induction also increased ALP activity and mineralisation. Furthermore, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was strongly enhanced by AR28 addition within 3days, but without concomitant changes in cell number, therefore revealing BMP-dependent and independent mechanisms for Wnt-induced osteogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Inducing organogenesis in 3D culture is an important aspect of stem cell research. Anterior neural structures have been produced from large embryonic stem cell (ESC) aggregates, but the steps involved in patterning such complex structures have been ill defined, as embryoid bodies typically contained many cell types. Here we show that single mouse ESCs directly embedded in Matrigel or defined synthetic matrices under neural induction conditions can clonally form neuroepithelial cysts containing a single lumen in 3D. Untreated cysts were uniformly dorsal and could be ventralized to floor plate (FP). Retinoic acid posteriorized cysts to cervical levels and induced localize FP formation yielding full patterning along the dorsal/ventral (DV) axis. Correct spatial organization of motor neurons, interneurons, and dorsal interneurons along the DV axis was observed. This system serves as a valuable tool for studying morphogen action in 3D and as a source of patterned spinal cord tissue.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive muscular weakness. Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) that has been identified in familial ALS is an RNA binding protein that is normally localized in the nucleus. However, its function in vivo is not fully understood. Drosophila has Cabeza (Caz) as a FUS homologue and specific knockdown of Caz in the eye imaginal disc and pupal retina using a GMR-GAL4 driver was here found to induce an abnormal morphology of the adult compound eyes, a rough eye phenotype. This was partially suppressed by expression of the apoptosis inhibitor P35. Knockdown of Caz exerted no apparent effect on differentiation of photoreceptor cells. However, immunostaining with an antibody to Cut that marks cone cells revealed fusion of these and ommatidia of pupal retinae. These results indicate that Caz knockdown induces apoptosis and also inhibits differentiation of cone cells, resulting in abnormal eye morphology in adults. Mutation in EGFR pathway-related genes, such as rhomboid-1, rhomboid-3 and mirror suppressed the rough eye phenotype induced by Caz knockdown. Moreover, the rhomboid-1 mutation rescued the fusion of cone cells and ommatidia observed in Caz knockdown flies. The results suggest that Caz negatively regulates the EGFR signaling pathway required for determination of cone cell fate in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
The type 2 immune response evoked by intestinal nematode parasites contributes to worm expulsion and tolerance to associated tissue damage. We investigated whether this host response is affected by blocking signaling by the putative endogenous danger signal adenosine, which can be released during inflammation and host cell damage. Specific blockade of the A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) inhibited worm elimination and the development of innate and adaptive components of the type 2 primary and memory response. Infected mice lacking A2BAR exhibited decreased M2 macrophage and eosinophil recruitment and reduced IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine production. Additionally, shortly after infection, upregulation of the alarmin IL-33, which drives type 2 immunity, and activation of innate lymphoid type 2 (ILC2) cells was inhibited, while exogenous IL-33 restored ILC2 cell activation and type 2 cytokine expression. Thus, adenosine acts as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that initiates helminth-induced type 2 immune responses through A2BAR.

Abstract: Summary
The recent identification of hemogenic endothelium (HE) in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) cultures presents opportunities to investigate signaling pathways that are essential for blood development from endothelium and provides an exploratory platform for de novo generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the use of poorly defined human or animal components limits the utility of the current differentiation systems for studying specific growth factors required for HE induction and manufacturing clinical-grade therapeutic blood cells. Here, we identified chemically defined conditions required to produce HE from hPSCs growing in Essential 8 (E8) medium and showed that Tenascin C (TenC), an extracellular matrix protein associated with HSC niches, strongly promotes HE and definitive hematopoiesis in this system. hPSCs differentiated in chemically defined conditions undergo stages of development similar to those previously described in hPSCs cocultured on OP9 feeders, including the formation of VE-Cadherin+CD73−CD235a/CD43− HE and hematopoietic progenitors with myeloid and T lymphoid potential.

Abstract: Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 (SPINT2), a Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor, has been identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter methylation. We aimed to investigate whether SPINT2 might act as an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor suppressor gene. Four ESCC cell lines, Fifty-two ESCC tissues and twenty-nine neighboring non-cancerous tissues were included in this study. The expression of SPINT2 was monitored by real time PCR. Bisulfite genomic sequencing and methylation-specific PCR were used to analyze methylation status. The effect of SPINT2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in EC109 and EC9706 cells was observed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometric analysis. We found that silencing of SPINT2 was associated with promoter methylation in ESCC cell lines. The densely methylated SPINT2 promoter region was confirmed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Ectopic expression of SPINT2 inhibited cell proliferation through inducing cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that SPINT2 promoter methylation was prominent in carcinoma tissues (52.08%) compared with neighboring non-cancerous tissues (22.58%). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that patients with SPINT2 hypermethylation had shorter survival time. The tumor suppressor gene of SPINT2 is commonly silenced by promoter hypermethylation in human ESCC and SPINT2 hypermethylation is correlated with poor overall survival, implicating SPINT2 is an underlying prognostic marker for human ESCC.

Abstract: This study sought to evaluate the effects of a single session of exercise on the expression of Hsp70, of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and insulin receptor substrate 1 serine 612 (IRSser612) phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle of obese and obese insulin-resistant patients. Twenty-seven volunteers were divided into three experimental groups (eutrophic insulin-sensitive, obese insulin-sensitive, and obese insulin-resistant) according to their body mass index and the presence of insulin resistance. The volunteers performed 60 min of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer at 60 % of peak oxygen consumption. M. vastus lateralis samples were obtained before and after exercise. The protein expressions were evaluated by Western blot. Our findings show that compared with paired eutrophic controls, obese subjects have higher basal levels of p-JNK (100 ± 23 % vs. 227 ± 67 %, p = 0.03) and p-IRS-1ser612 (100 ± 23 % vs. 340 ± 67 %, p < 0.001) and reduced HSP70 (100 ± 16 % vs. 63 ± 12 %, p < 0.001). The presence of insulin resistance results in a further increase in p-JNK (460 ± 107 %, p < 0.001) and a decrease in Hsp70 (46 ± 5 %, p = 0.006), but p-IRS-1ser612 levels did not differ from obese subjects (312 ± 73 %, p > 0.05). Exercise reduced p-JNK in obese insulin-resistant subjects (328 ± 33 %, p = 0.001), but not in controls or obese subjects. Furthermore, exercise reduced p-IRS-1ser612 for both obese (122 ± 44 %) and obese insulin-resistant (185 ± 36 %) subjects. A main effect of exercise was observed in HSP70 (p = 0.007). We demonstrated that a single session of exercise promotes changes that characterize a reduction in cellular stress that may contribute to exercise-induced increase in insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia is a primary factor that disturbs podocyte function in the glomerular filtration process; this disturbance leads to the development of diabetic nephropathy, and ultimately, renal failure. Podocyte function may also be altered by biological agents that modify protein kinase activity, including the cGMP-activated protein kinase type Iα (PKGIα). We hypothesized that hyperglycemia-induced podocyte protein hyperpermeability was dependent on PKGIα activation, and that PKGIα was activated via dimerization induced by reactive oxygen species. This hypothesis was investigated in rat podocytes cultured in high glucose (HG, 30mM). Protein expression was measured with Western blot and immunofluorescence. Podocyte permeability was measured with a transmembrane albumin flux assay. We found that HG increased podocyte permeability in long-term incubations (1, 3, and 5 days); permeability was increased by 66% on day 5. This effect was abolished with apocynin, a NAD(P)H inhibitor, and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS, a PKG inhibitor. It was also abolished by introducing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Nox4 and PKGIα into cultured podocytes. Furthermore, HG increased PKGIα dimerization by 138% (0.23±0.04 vs. 0.54±0.09; P<0.05); this effect was abolished with a siRNA against Nox4. Our observations suggested that HG could increase albumin permeability across the podocyte filtration barrier via Nox4-dependent PKGIα dimerization.

Abstract: Cells thought to be stem cells isolated from the cornea of the eye have been shown to exhibit neurogenic potential. We set out to uncover the identity and location of these cells within the cornea and to elucidate their neuronal protein and gene expression profile during the process of switching to a neuron-like cell. Here we report that every cell of the adult human and rat corneal stroma is capable of differentiating into a neuron-like cell when treated with neurogenic differentiation specifying growth factors. Furthermore, the expression of genes regulating neurogenesis and mature neuronal structure and function was increased. The switch from a corneal stromal cell to a neuron-like cell was also shown to occur in vivo in intact corneas of living rats. Our results clearly indicate that lineage specifying growth factors can affect changes in the protein and gene expression profiles of adult cells, suggesting that possibly many adult cell populations can be made to switch into another type of mature cell by simply modifying the growth factor environment.

Abstract: The present analyses were undertaken to define the mechanisms by which fetuin-A modulates cellular adhesion. FLAG-tagged fetuin-A was expressed in breast carcinoma and HEK-293T cells. We demonstrated by confocal microscopy that fetuin-A co-localizes with histone H2A in the cell nucleus, forms stable complexes with histones such as H2A and H3 in solution, and shuttles histones to exosomes. The rate of cellular adhesion and spreading to either fibronectin or laminin coated wells was accelerated significantly in the presence of either endogenous fetuin-A or serum derived protein. More importantly, the formation of focal adhesion complexes on surfaces coated by laminin or fibronectin was accelerated in the presence of fetuin-A or histone coated exosomes. Cellular adhesion mediated by histone coated exosomes was abrogated by heparin and heparinase III. Heparinase III cleaves heparan sulfate from cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Lastly, the uptake of histone coated exosomes and subsequent cellular adhesion, was abrogated by heparin. Taken together, the data suggest a mechanism where fetuin-A, either endogenously synthesized or supplied extracellularly can extract histones from the nucleus or elsewhere in the cytosol/membrane and load them on cellular exosomes which then mediate adhesion by interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans via bound histones.

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) contain a subset of multipotent stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that serotonin, a biogenic amine released by platelets and mast cells, can induce the smooth muscle differentiation of BMSCs. Brown Norway rat BMSCs stimulated with serotonin had increased expression of the smooth muscle markers smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) and α actin (α-SMA) by qPCR and Western blot, indicating smooth muscle differentiation. This was accompanied by a concomitant down-regulation of the microRNA miR-25-5p, which was found to negatively regulate smooth muscle differentiation. Serotonin upregulated serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin, transcription factors known to induce contractile protein expression in smooth muscle cells, while it down-regulated Elk1 and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to induce proliferation. Serotonin increased SRF binding to promoter regions of the MHC and α-SMA genes, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Induction of smooth muscle differentiation by serotonin was blocked by the knock-down of SRF and myocardin. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 was constitutively expressed by BMSCs and serotonin triggered its release. Inhibition of miR-25-5p augmented TGF-β1 expression, however the differentiation of BMSCs was not mediated by TGF-β1. These findings demonstrate that serotonin promotes a smooth muscle-like phenotype in BMSCs by altering the balance of SRF, myocardin, Elk1 and KLF4 and miR-25-5p is involved in modulating this balance. Therefore, serotonin potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by tissue remodeling with increased smooth muscle mass.

Abstract: We developed a three-dimensional (3D) cellular microarray platform for the high-throughput (HT) analysis of human neural stem cell (hNSC) growth and differentiation. The growth of an immortalized hNSC line, ReNcell VM, was evaluated on a miniaturized cell culture chip consisting of 60nl spots of cells encapsulated in alginate, and compared to standard 2D well plate culture conditions. Using a live/dead cell viability assay, we demonstrated that the hNSCs are able to expand on-chip, albeit with lower proliferation rates and viabilities than in conventional 2D culture platforms. Using an in-cell, on-chip immunofluorescence assay, which provides quantitative information on cellular levels of proteins involved in neural fate, we demonstrated that ReNcell VM can preserve its multipotent state during on-chip expansion. Moreover, differentiation of the hNSCs into glial progeny was achieved both off- and on-chip six days after growth factor removal, accompanied by a decrease in the neural progenitor markers. The versatility of the platform was further demonstrated by complementing the cell culture chip with a chamber system that allowed us to screen for differential toxicity of small molecules to hNSCs. Using this approach, we showed differential toxicity when evaluating three neurotoxic compounds and one antiproliferative compound, and the null effect of a non-toxic compound at relevant concentrations. Thus, our 3D high-throughput microarray platform may help predict, in vitro, which compounds pose an increased threat to neural development and should therefore be prioritized for further screening and evaluation.

Abstract: The cytokine interferon-α (IFNα) belongs to the group of type I interferons already used in cancer therapy. This drug possesses radio- and chemo-sensitizing, and shows anti-angiogenic properties. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a unique population of tumor cells that initiate secondary tumors, and are responsible for metastasis formation. Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have an especially poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of only ~1% and median survival of 4–6 months. PDAC is characterized by the presence of CSC. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that IFNα up-regulates the expression of the CSC markers CD24, CD44 and CD133 in in vitro and in vivo models of PDAC. We showed the IFNα effects on the migration and invasion of PDAC cells, which is associated with the level of the CSC marker expression. In vivo, this drug inhibits tumor growth but promotes metastasis formation in the early stage of tumor growth. We propose that IFNα may enhance the enrichment of CSC in PDAC tumors. Additionally we also suggest that in combination therapy of solid tumors with IFNα, this drug should be given to patients prior to chemotherapy to achieve the CSC activation.

Abstract: The opportunity for fuel cell deployment is well understood in the telecom sector, offering significant operational and environmental benefits over traditional technologies such as diesel generators and batteries. Acta has developed the Acta Power self-recharging fuel cell system, which regenerates the hydrogen used onsite, using electricity from the grid or renewable sources plus water. This eliminates the need to swap hydrogen cylinders, removing a major barrier to the deployment of hydrogen fuel cells in the telecom sector.

Abstract: Summary
(+)strand RNA viruses have to overcome various points of restriction in the host to establish successful infection. In plants, this includes RNA silencing. To uncover additional bottlenecks to RNA virus infection, we genetically attenuated the impact of RNA silencing on transgenically expressed Potato virus X (PVX), a (+)strand RNA virus that replicates in Arabidopsis. A genetic screen in this sensitized background uncovered how nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a host RNA quality control mechanism, recognizes and eliminates PVX RNAs with internal termination codons and long 3′ UTRs. NMD also operates in natural infection contexts, and while some viruses have evolved genome expression strategies to overcome this process altogether, the virulence of NMD-activating viruses entails their ability to directly suppress NMD or to promote an NMD-unfavorable cellular state. These principles of induction, evasion, and suppression define NMD as a general viral restriction mechanism in plants that also likely operates in animals.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) triggers crucial signaling processes that regulate tumor angiogenesis and, therefore, represents an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. Several epidemiological studies have confirmed that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with reduced risk of developing cancers. In the Mediterranean basin, the consumption of extra virgin olive oil is an important constituent of the diet. Compared to other vegetable oils, the presence of several phenolic antioxidants in olive oil is believed to prevent the occurrence of a variety of pathological processes, such as cancer. While the strong antioxidant potential of these molecules is well characterized, their antiangiogenic activities remain unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate whether tyrosol (Tyr), hydroxytyrosol (HT), taxifolin (Tax), oleuropein (OL) and oleic acid (OA), five compounds contained in extra virgin olive oil, can affect in vitro angiogenesis. We found that HT, Tax and OA were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory effect on specific autophosphorylation sites of VEGFR-2 (Tyr951, Tyr1059, Tyr1175 and Tyr1214) leading to the inhibition of endothelial cell (EC) signaling. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 by these olive oil compounds significantly reduced VEGF-induced EC proliferation and migration as well as their morphogenic differentiation into capillary-like tubular structures in Matrigel. Our study demonstrates that HT, Tax and OA are novel and potent inhibitors of the VEGFR-2 signaling pathway. These findings emphasize the chemopreventive properties of olive oil and highlight the importance of nutrition in cancer prevention.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens utilize features of the host response as cues to regulate virulence gene expression. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) sense Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent signals to induce Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2), a locus required for intracellular replication. To examine pathogenicity in the absence of such cues, we evaluated ST virulence in mice lacking all TLR function (Tlr2−/−xTlr4−/−xUnc93b13d/3d). When delivered systemically to TLR-deficient mice, ST do not require SPI2 and maintain virulence by replicating extracellularly. In contrast, SPI2 mutant ST are highly attenuated after oral infection of the same mice, revealing a role for SPI2 in the earliest stages of infection, even when intracellular replication is not required. This early requirement for SPI2 is abolished in MyD88−/−xTRIF−/− mice lacking both TLR- and other MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, a potential consequence of compromised intestinal permeability. These results demonstrate how pathogens use plasticity in virulence strategies to respond to different host immune environments.

Abstract: Deletion studies confirm Wnt, Notch and Myb transcriptional pathway engagement in intestinal tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their contrasting and combined roles when activated have not been elucidated. This is important as these pathways are not ablated but rather are aberrantly activated during carcinogenesis. Using ApcMin/+ mice as a source of organoids we documented their transition, on a clone-by-clone basis, to cyst-like spheres with constitutively activated Wnt pathway, increased self-renewal and growth and reduced differentiation. We then looked at this transition when Myb and/or Notch1 are activated. Activated Notch promoted cyst-like organoids. Conversely growth and propagation of cyst-like, but not normal organoids were Notch-independent. Activated Myb promoted normal, but not cyst-like organoids. Interestingly the Wnt, Notch and Myb pathways were all involved in regulating the expression of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) gene Lgr5 in organoids, while ISC gene and Notch target Olfm4 was dominantly repressed by Wnt. These findings parallel mouse intestinal adenoma formation where Notch promoted the initiation, but not growth, of Wnt-driven Olfm4-repressed colon tumors. Also Myb was essential for colon tumor initiation and collateral mouse pathologies. These data reveal the complex interplay and hierarchy of transcriptional networks that operate in ISCs and uncover a shift in pathway-dependencies during tumor initiation.
