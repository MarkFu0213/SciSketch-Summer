Abstract: Much about septin function has been inferred from in vivo studies using mainly genetic methods, and much of what we know about septin organization has been obtained through examination of static structures in vitro primarily by electron microscopy. Deeper mechanistic insight requires real-time analysis of the dynamics of the assembly of septin-based structures and how other proteins associate with them. We describe here a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach for measuring in vitro the rate and extent of filament formation from septin complexes, binding of other proteins to septin structures, and the apparent affinities of these interactions. FRET is particularly well suited for interrogating protein–protein interactions, especially on a rapid timescale; the spectral change provides an unambiguous indication of whether two elements within the system under study are associating and serves as a molecular-level “ruler” because it is very sensitive to the separation between the donor and acceptor fluorophores over biologically relevant distances (≤10nm). The necessary procedures involve generation of appropriate cysteine-less and single cysteine-containing septin variants, expression and purification of the heterooctameric complexes containing them, efficient labeling of the purified complexes with desired fluorophores, fluorimetric measurement of FRET, and appropriate safeguards and controls in data acquisition and analysis. Our methods can be used to interrogate the effects of buffer conditions, small molecules, and septin-binding proteins on septin filament assembly or stability; determine the effect of alternative septin subunits, mutational alterations, or posttranslational modifications on assembly; and, delineate the location of septin-binding proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results from bacterial strategies that manipulate host adaptive immune responses. Infected dendritic cells (DCs) transport M. tuberculosis to local lymph nodes but activate CD4 T cells poorly, suggesting bacterial manipulation of antigen presentation. However, M. tuberculosis antigens are also exported from infected DCs and taken up and presented by uninfected DCs, possibly overcoming this blockade of antigen presentation by infected cells. Here we show that the first stage of this antigen transfer, antigen export, benefits M. tuberculosis by diverting bacterial proteins from the antigen presentation pathway. Kinesin-2 is required for antigen export and depletion of this microtubule-based motor increases activation of antigen-specific CD4 T cells by infected cells and improves control of intracellular infection. Thus, although antigen transfer enables presentation by bystander cells, it does not compensate for reduced antigen presentation by infected cells and represents a bacterial strategy for CD4 T cell evasion.

Abstract: The organization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) into dimers and higher-order oligomers has provided a potential mechanistic system in defining complex GPCR responses. Despite being studied for nearly 20years it has, and still is, been an area of controversy. Although technology has developed to quantitatively measure these associations in real time, identify the structural interfaces and even systems to understand the physiological significance of di/oligomerization, key questions remain outstanding including the role of each individual complex from the monomer to the higher-order oligomer, in their native system. Recently, single-molecule microscopy approaches have provided the tools to directly visualize individual GPCRs in dimers and oligomers, though as with any technological development each have their advantages and limitations. This chapter will describe these recent developments in single-molecule fluorescent microscopy, focusing on our recent application of super-resolution imaging of the GPCR for the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin to quantify GPCR monomers and formation of protomers in to dimers and distinct oligomeric forms. We present our approach, considerations, strategy, and challenges to visualize this receptor beyond the light diffraction limit via photoactivated localization microscopy with photoactivatable dyes. The addition of super-resolution approaches to the GPCR “nano-tool kit” will pave the way for novel avenues to answer outstanding questions regarding the existence and significance of these complexes to GPCR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Avian influenza virus reassortants resembling the 1918 human pandemic virus can become transmissible among mammals by acquiring mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase. Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a “loose” bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes for the fetus, including postnatal cognitive disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms are obscure. We find that bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (CW), a universal PAMP for TLR2, traverses the murine placenta into the developing fetal brain. In contrast to adults, CW-exposed fetal brains did not show any signs of inflammation or neuronal death. Instead, the neuronal transcription factor FoxG1 was induced, and neuroproliferation leading to a 50% greater density of neurons in the cortical plate was observed. Bacterial infection of pregnant dams, followed by antibiotic treatment, which releases CW, yielded the same result. Neuroproliferation required TLR2 and was recapitulated in vitro with fetal neuronal precursor cells and TLR2/6, but not TLR2/1, ligands. The fetal neuroproliferative response correlated with abnormal cognitive behavior in CW-exposed pups following birth. Thus, the bacterial CW-TLR2 signaling axis affects fetal neurodevelopment and may underlie postnatal cognitive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) represent the strongest common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are still poorly understood. Here, we have analyzed ten independent induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from three controls and three unrelated PD patients heterozygous for the GBA-N370S mutation, and identified relevant disease mechanisms. After differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, we observed misprocessing of mutant glucocerebrosidase protein in the ER, associated with activation of ER stress and abnormal cellular lipid profiles. Furthermore, we observed autophagic perturbations and an enlargement of the lysosomal compartment specifically in dopamine neurons. Finally, we found increased extracellular α-synuclein in patient-derived neuronal culture medium, which was not associated with exosomes. Overall, ER stress, autophagic/lysosomal perturbations, and elevated extracellular α-synuclein likely represent critical early cellular phenotypes of PD, which might offer multiple therapeutic targets.

Abstract: In the endothelial recovery process, bone marrow-derived MSCs are a potential source of cells for both research and therapy, and their capacities to self-renew and to differentiate into all the cell types in the human body make them a promising therapeutic agent for remodeling cellular differentiation and a valuable resource for the treatment of many diseases. Based on the results provided in a miRNA database, we selected miRNAs with unique targets in cell fate-related signaling pathways. The tested miRNAs targeting GSK-3β (miR-26a), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and CD133 (miR-26a and miR-29b) induced MSC differentiation into functional ECs, whereas miRNAs targeting VEGF receptor (miR-15, miR-144, miR-145, and miR-329) inhibited MSC differentiation into ECs through VEGF stimulation. In addition, the expression levels of these miRNAs were correlated with in vivo physiological endothelial recovery processes. These findings indicate that the miRNA expression profile is distinct for cells in different stages of differentiation from MSCs to ECs and that specific miRNAs can function as regulators of endothelialization.

Abstract: Almost all epithelial tumours contain cancer stem-like cells, which possess a unique property of self-renewal and differentiation. In oral cancer, several biomarkers including cell surface molecules have been exploited for the identification of this highly tumorigenic population. Implicit is the role of CD44 in defining CSCs but CD24 is not well-explored. Here we show that CD44highCD24low cells isolated from the oral cancer cell lines, not only express stem cell related genes but also exhibit Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. This CD44highCD24low population gives rise to all other cell types upon differentiation. Typical Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) phenotypes like increased colony formation, sphere forming ability, migration and invasion were also confirmed in CD44highCD24low cells. Drug transporters were found to be over-expressed in CD44highCD24low sub-population thereby contributing to elevated chemo-resistance. To validate our findings in-vivo, we determined the relative expression of CD44 and CD24 in clinical samples of OSCC patients. CD44 expression was consistently high whereas CD24 showed significantly lower expression in tumour tissues. Further, the gene expression profile of the CSC and non-CSC population unravels the molecular pathways which may contribute to stemness. We conclude that CD44highCD24low represents cancer stem-like cells in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

Abstract: Therapeutic strategies for the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have not yet provided satisfactory results. Interest in stem cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing and their beneficial action seems to be due to a paracrine effect via the release of exosomes, main mediators of cell–cell communication. Here we wished to assess, in vitro, the efficacy of a novel non-cell therapeutic approach based on the use of exosomes derived from murine adipose-derived stromal cells on motoneuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing ALS mutations, and used as in vitro models of disease. In particular, we set out to investigate the effect of exosomes on NSC-34 naïve cells and NSC-34 cells overexpressing human SOD1(G93A) or SOD1(G37R) or SOD1(A4V) mutants, exposed to oxidative stress. The data presented here indicate for the first time that exosomes (0.2µg/ml) are able to protect NSC-34 cells from oxidative damage, which is one of the main mechanism of damage in ALS, increasing cell viability. These data highlight a promising role of exosomes derived from stem cells for potential therapeutic applications in motoneuron disease.

Abstract: Canonical Notch signaling involves Notch receptor activation via interaction with cell surface bound Notch ligand. Recent findings also indicate that Notch signaling may be modulated by cross-talk with other signaling mechanisms. The ECM protein MAGP2 was previously shown to regulate Notch in a cell type dependent manner, although the molecular details of this interaction have not been dissected. Here, we report that MAGP2 cell type specific control of Notch is independent of individual Notch receptor-ligand combinations but dependent on interaction with RGD binding integrins. Overexpressed MAGP2 was found to suppress transcriptional activity from the Notch responsive Hes1 promoter activity in endothelial cells, while overexpression of a RGD→RGE MAGP2 mutant increased Notch signaling in the same cell type. This effect was not unique to MAGP2 since the RGD domain of the ECM protein EGFL7 was also found to be an important modulator of Hes1 promoter activity. Independently of MAGP2 or EGFL7, inhibition of RGD-binding integrins with soluble RGD peptides also increased accumulation of active N1ICD fragments and Notch responsive promoter activity independently of changes in Notch1, Jag1, or Dll4 expression. Finally, β1 or β3 integrin blocking antibodies also enhanced Notch signaling. Collectively, these results answer the question of how MAGP2 controls cell type dependent Notch signaling, but more importantly uncover a new mechanism to understand how extracellular matrices and cellular environments impact Notch signaling.

Abstract: The Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN; zfin.org) serves as the central repository for genetic and genomic data produced using zebrafish (Danio rerio). Data in ZFIN are either manually curated from peer-reviewed publications or submitted directly to ZFIN from various data repositories. Data types currently supported include mutants, transgenic lines, DNA constructs, gene expression, phenotypes, antibodies, morpholinos, TALENs, CRISPRs, disease models, movies, and images. The rapidly changing methods of genomic science have increased the production of data that cannot readily be represented in standard journal publications. These large data sets require web-based presentation. As the central repository for zebrafish research data, it has become increasingly important for ZFIN to provide the zebrafish research community with support for their data sets and guidance on what is required to submit these data to ZFIN. Regardless of their volume, all data that are submitted for inclusion in ZFIN must include a minimum set of information that describes the data. The aim of this chapter is to identify data types that fit into the current ZFIN database and explain how to provide those data in the optimal format for integration. We identify the required and optional data elements, define jargon, and present tools and templates that can help with the acquisition and organization of data as they are being prepared for submission to ZFIN. This information will also appear in the ZFIN wiki, where it will be updated as our services evolve over time.

Abstract: Deregulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is closely associated with the progression of various types of cancers, but its role in pancreatic carcinogenesis is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of TLR4 in the angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The culture supernatant (conditioned medium) of PANC-1 cells after appropriate treatment was used for the treatment of HUVECs. The proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs were assessed by MTT, Transwell and Matrigel, respectively. In pancreatic cancer tissues, TLR4, VEGF and CD31 were upregulated as determined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of TLR4 and VEGF was positively correlated with microvessel density as detected by CD31 staining. Activation of TLR4 signaling by LPS in PANC-1 cells resulted in increased VEGF and phosphorylation of AKT, which were abolished by TLR4 silencing with siRNA and PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002. The conditioned medium from PANC-1 cells treated with LY294002 or transfected with TRL4 siRNA reduced the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. In contrast, the conditioned medium from PANC-1 cells treated with LPS stimulated the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, which was however significantly inhibited by pretreatment of PANC-1 cells with LY294002 or transfection with TRL4 siRNA. Our findings suggest TLR4 may promote angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to induce VEGF expression.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a central role in host responses to bacterial infection, but the precise mechanism(s) by which its downstream signaling components coordinate the bone marrow response to sepsis is poorly understood. Using mice deficient in TLR4 downstream adapters MYD88 or TRIF, we demonstrate that both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous MYD88 activation are major causes of myelosuppression during sepsis, while having a modest impact on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions. In contrast, cell-intrinsic TRIF activation severely compromises HSC self-renewal without directly affecting myeloid cells. Lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of MYD88 or TRIF contributes to cell-cycle activation of HSC and induces rapid and permanent changes in transcriptional programs, as indicated by persistent downregulation of Spi1 and CebpA expression after transplantation. Thus, distinct mechanisms downstream of TLR4 signaling mediate myelosuppression and HSC exhaustion during sepsis through unique effects of MyD88 and TRIF.

Abstract: Summary
Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) inject bacterial effector proteins into host cells and underlie the virulence of many gram-negative pathogens. Studies have illuminated bacterial factors required for T3SS function, but the required host processes remain largely undefined. We coupled CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology with the cytotoxicity of two Vibrio parahaemolyticus T3SSs (T3SS1 and T3SS2) to identify human genome disruptions conferring resistance to T3SS-dependent cytotoxicity. We identity non-overlapping genes required for T3SS1- and T3SS2-mediated cytotoxicity. Genetic ablation of cell surface sulfation reduces bacterial adhesion and thereby alters the kinetics of T3SS1-mediated cytotoxicity. Cell surface fucosylation is required for T3SS2-dependent killing, and genetic inhibition of fucosylation prevents membrane insertion of the T3SS2 translocon complex. These findings reveal the importance of ubiquitous surface modifications for T3SS function, potentially explaining the broad tropism of V. parahaemolyticus, and highlight the utility of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to discover processes underlying host-pathogen interactions.

Abstract: In the last decade highly conserved cellular appendages called cilia have enjoyed a renewed interest from basic, biomedical scientists, and clinicians alike. This interest has grown upon the elucidation that cilia throughout the body serve as important sensory and signaling centers in both development and adult homeostasis. Furthermore, the identification of several rare genetic disorders associated with cilia dysfunction has broadened the field. However, even though their potential role in human health and disease is now recognized many basic questions about their functions remain. This chapter seeks to explore the trafficking of cilia-specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and discusses several model systems in which this has been explored. We open the chapter by briefly discussing cilia and GPCRs then begin discussing some aspects of rhodopsin trafficking, arguably the most well studied of cilia GPCRs. We continue with sections on neuronal cilia and olfactory cilia receptor trafficking. Finally, we conclude with the emerging area of dynamic ciliary GPCR trafficking and speculate about future directions and some of the questions that remain for ciliary GPCRs.

Abstract: Summary
Modern enzyme complexes are characterized by a high catalytic efficiency and allosteric communication between the constituting protein subunits. We were interested in whether primordial enzyme complexes from extinct species displayed a similar degree of functional sophistication. To this end, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect the α and β subunits of the tryptophan synthase (TS) complex from the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA), which presumably existed more than 3.4 billion years ago. We show that the LBCA TS subunits are thermostable and exhibit high catalytic activity. Moreover, they form a complex with αββα stoichiometry whose crystal structure is similar to that of modern TS. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction intermediate indole is channeled from the α to the β subunits and suggests that allosteric communication already occurred in LBCA TS.

Abstract: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) has previously been linked to allergic inflammatory diseases, and tissue fibrosis and organ dysfunction may also arise from such inflammation. It remains unclear, however, whether TSLP plays any role in the occurrence of renal fibrosis, so this study investigated that possibility. An in vitro fibrosis model was established by treating normal rat kidney fibroblast (NRK-49F) cells with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), after which the levels of various fibrogenic markers (e.g., fibronectin) and downstream fibrogenic signal proteins (e.g., smad 7) were investigated. Also, TSLP shRNA was used to silence the effects of TSLP, while an ELISA was conducted to evaluate the fibronectin secretions. The level of fibronectin in the NRK-49F cells was dose- and time-dependently increased by the administration of exogenous TSLP (P<0.05). TSLP also significantly increased the level of fibrosis signaling, in addition to inducing a marked decrease in the down-regulation of Smad7. Interestingly, the application of TSLP shRNA caused a stark reversal of the TGF-β1-induced cellular fibrosis while simultaneously leading to the suppression of fibronectin and fibrogenic signal proteins. Taken together, these observations provide insights into how extracellular matrices develop and could thus lead to potential therapeutic interventions for the suppression of renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Limited availability of human neurons poses a significant barrier to progress in biological and preclinical studies of the human nervous system. Current stem cell-based approaches of neuron generation are still hindered by prolonged culture requirements, protocol complexity, and variability in neuronal differentiation. Here we establish stable human induced neural stem cell (hiNSC) lines through the direct reprogramming of neonatal fibroblasts and adult adipose-derived stem cells. These hiNSCs can be passaged indefinitely and cryopreserved as colonies. Independently of media composition, hiNSCs robustly differentiate into TUJ1-positive neurons within 4 days, making them ideal for innervated co-cultures. In vivo, hiNSCs migrate, engraft, and contribute to both central and peripheral nervous systems. Lastly, we demonstrate utility of hiNSCs in a 3D human brain model. This method provides a valuable interdisciplinary tool that could be used to develop drug screening applications as well as patient-specific disease models related to disorders of innervation and the brain.

Abstract: Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the outermost layer of the retina, has a key role in maintaining retinal cells’ functions. Severity of the culture of RPE cells has exerted many limitations to both in vitro and in vivo studies and its therapeutic applications. Therefore, establishment of RPE cell lines with high proliferative potential can considerably improve study of RPE cell biology. Here we report generation of a spontaneously immortalized murine RPE cell line in primary mouse RPE cell culture. Founded colonized cells were picked up and expression of RPE and retinal progenitor cells’ (RPC) markers were studied using immunocytochemistry (ICC). Emerged cells cultured over 35 passages and population doubling times in different serum concentrations were calculated. We also investigated the ability of cells for becoming transfected by calcium-phosphate method and for becoming infected by adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) using flow cytometry. Data showed that the cobblestone constituent cells expressed RPE65, cytokeratin and ZO1 and moreover several progenitor markers such as Pax6, Sox2, Nestin and Chx10. It revealed that, despite primary RPE cells, the newly emerged cells were easily transfectable and were highly infectable when compared with HEK293T cells. Our data indicated that the emerged mouse RPE cell line pretended RPC-like phenotype and also simultaneously expressed RPE markers. It would be a promising model for leading studies on RPE and RPC cells and substantially confirmed the great RPE plasticity and its invaluable potential in research studies.

Kushenin induces the apoptosis of HCV-infected cells by blocking the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via inhibiting NS5A,

Abstract: With the increased burden induced by HCV, there is an urgent need to develop better-tolerated agents with good safety. In this study, we evaluated the anti-HCV capability of kushenin, as well as the possible mechanism to Huh7.5-HCV cells. The results demonstrated that kushenin significantly inhibited the HCV-RNA level. Similarly, the expression of HCV-specific protein NS5A was also decreased. Molecular docking results displayed that kushenin bonded well to the active pockets of HCV NS5A, further confirming the effects of kushenin on HCV replication. Coimmunoprecipitation assay determined that kushenin suppressed the interaction between PI3K and NS5A in HCV-replicon cells. Furthermore, kushenin exerted an obviously induced function on HCV-replicon cells apoptosis by inhibiting PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which could be ameliorated by the specific activator IGF-1 addition. Taken together, kushenin possesses the ability to inhibit HCV replication, and contributes to the increased apoptosis of HCV-infected cells by blocking the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via inhibiting NS5A. Our results provide important evidence for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCV infection, and suggest that kushenin has the potential to treat HCV disease.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited cell source for regenerative medicine. Hormone-producing cells are particularly suitable for cell therapy, and hypopituitarism, a defect in pituitary gland function, represents a promising therapeutic target. Previous studies have derived pituitary lineages from mouse and human ESCs using 3D organoid cultures that mimic the complex events underlying pituitary gland development in vivo. Instead of relying on unknown cellular signals, we present a simple and efficient strategy to derive human pituitary lineages from hPSCs using monolayer culture conditions suitable for cell manufacturing. We demonstrate that purified placode cells can be directed into pituitary fates using defined signals. hPSC-derived pituitary cells show basal and stimulus-induced hormone release in vitro and engraftment and hormone release in vivo after transplantation into a murine model of hypopituitarism. This work lays the foundation for future cell therapy applications in patients with hypopituitarism.

Abstract: Summary
One major obstacle to the application of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) for disease modeling and clinical therapies is the inability to identify the developmental stage of these cells without the need for genetic manipulation or utilization of exogenous markers. In this study, we demonstrate that Raman microspectroscopy can non-invasively identify embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived chamber-specific CMs and monitor cell maturation. Using this marker-free approach, Raman peaks were identified for atrial and ventricular CMs, ESCs were successfully discriminated from their cardiac derivatives, a distinct phenotypic spectrum for ESC-derived CMs was confirmed, and unique spectral differences between fetal versus adult CMs were detected. The real-time identification and characterization of CMs, their progenitors, and subpopulations by Raman microspectroscopy strongly correlated to the phenotypical features of these cells. Due to its high molecular resolution, Raman microspectroscopy offers distinct analytical characterization for differentiating cardiovascular cell populations.

Abstract: Changes in the levels of three structurally and functionally different important thermoprotectant molecules, namely small heat shock proteins (sHsps), trehalose, and lipids, have been investigated upon heat shock in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both α-crystallin-type sHsps (Hsp15.8 and Hsp16) were induced after prolonged high-temperature treatment but with different kinetic profiles. The shsp null mutants display a weak, but significant, heat sensitivity indicating their importance in the thermal stress management. The heat induction of sHsps is different in wild type and in highly heat-sensitive trehalose-deficient (tps1Δ) cells; however, trehalose level did not show significant alteration in shsp mutants. The altered timing of trehalose accumulation and induction of sHsps suggest that the disaccharide might provide protection at the early stage of the heat stress while elevated amount of sHsps are required at the later phase. The cellular lipid compositions of two different temperature-adapted wild-type S. pombe cells are also altered according to the rule of homeoviscous adaptation, indicating their crucial role in adapting to the environmental temperature changes. Both Hsp15.8 and Hsp16 are able to bind to different lipids isolated from S. pombe, whose interaction might provide a powerful protection against heat-induced damages of the membranes. Our data suggest that all the three investigated thermoprotectant macromolecules play a pivotal role during the thermal stress management in the fission yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Fucose, a terminal sugar in glycoconjugates, critically regulates various physiological and pathological phenomena, including cancer development and inflammation. However, there are currently no probes for efficient labeling and detection of this sugar. We chemically synthesized a novel series of alkynyl-fucose analogs as probe candidates and found that 7-alkynyl-fucose gave the highest labeling efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Among the fucose analogs, 7-alkynyl-fucose was the best substrate against all five fucosyltransferases examined. We confirmed its conversion to the corresponding guanosine diphosphate derivative in cells and found that cellular glycoproteins were labeled much more efficiently with 7-alkynyl-fucose than with an existing probe. 7-Alkynyl-fucose was detected in the N-glycan core by mass spectrometry, and 7-alkynyl-fucose-modified proteins mostly disappeared in core-fucose-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that this analog mainly labeled core fucose in these cells. These results indicate that 7-alkynyl-fucose is a highly sensitive and powerful tool for basic glycobiology research and clinical application for biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Septins are highly conserved and essential eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins that interact with the inner plasma membrane. They are involved in essential functions requiring cell membrane remodeling and compartmentalization, such as cell division and dendrite morphogenesis, and have been implicated in numerous diseases. Depending on the organisms and on the type of tissue, a specific set of septins genes are expressed, ranging from 2 to 13. Septins self-assemble into linear, symmetric rods that can further organize into linear filaments several microns in length. Only a subset of human septins has been described at high resolution by X-ray crystallography (Sirajuddin et al., 2007). Electron microscopy (EM) has proven to be a method of choice for analyzing the molecular organization of septins. It is possible to localize each septin subunit within the rod complex using genetic tags, such as maltose-binding protein or green fluorescent protein, to generate a visible label of a specific septin subunit in EM images that are processed using single-particle EM methodology. In this chapter we present, in detail, the methods that we have used to analyze the molecular organization of budding yeast septins (Bertin et al., 2008). These methods include purification of septin complexes, sample preparation for EM, and image processing procedures. Such methods can be generalized to analyze the organization of septins from any organism.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from replication to non-replication underlies much of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis, as non- or slowly replicating Mtb are responsible for persistence and poor treatment outcomes. Therapeutic targeting of non-replicating populations is a priority for tuberculosis treatment, but few drug targets in non-replicating Mtb are currently known. Here, we directly measured the activity of the highly diverse and druggable serine hydrolases (SHs) during active replication and non-replication using activity-based proteomics. We predict SH activity for 78 proteins, including 27 proteins with unknown function, and identify 37 SHs that remain active in the absence of replication, providing a set of candidate persistence targets. Non-replication was associated with major shifts in SH activity. These activity changes were largely independent of SH abundance, indicating extensive post-translational regulation of SHs. By probing a large cross-section of druggable Mtb enzyme space during replication and non-replication, we identify new SHs and suggest new persistence targets.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 belongs to a family of some of the most highly expressed heat shock proteins that function as molecular chaperones to protect the proteome not only from the heat shock but also from other misfolding events. As many client proteins of Hsp90 are involved in oncogenesis, this chaperone has been the focus of intense research efforts. Yet, we lack structural information for how Hsp90 interacts with co-chaperones and client proteins. Here, we developed a mass-spectrometry-based approach that allowed quantitative measurements of in vitro and in vivo effects of small-molecule inhibitors on Hsp90 conformation, and interaction with co-chaperones and client proteins. From this analysis, we were able to derive structural models for how Hsp90 engages its interaction partners in vivo, and how different drugs affect these structures. In addition, the methodology described here offers a new approach to probe the effects of virtually any inhibitor treatment on the proteome level.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is associated with a highly abundant stroma and low-grade inflammation. In the local tumour microenvironment, elevated glucose levels, the presence of tumour-associated stellate cells and macrophages are hypothesised to promote the tumour progression and invasion. The present study investigated the influence by the microenvironment on pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vitro. After co-culture with tumour-associated pancreatic stellate cells (TPSCs), pancreatic cancer cells displayed up to 8-fold reduction in levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, while β-catenin and vimentin levels were increased. A 3D organotypic model showed that TPSCs stimulated pancreatic cancer cell invasion, both as single cell (PANC-1) and cohort (MIAPaCa-2) invasion. The combined presence of TPSCs and M2-like macrophages induced invasion of the non-invasive BxPC-3 cells. High glucose conditions further enhanced changes in EMT markers as well as the cancer cell invasion. In summary, co-culture with TPSCs induced molecular changes associated with EMT in pancreatic cancer cells, regardless of differentiation status, and the organotypic model demonstrated the influence of microenvironmental factors, such as glucose, stellate cells and macrophages, on pancreatic cancer cell invasion.

Rab11-FIP1A regulates early trafficking into the recycling endosomes,

Abstract: The Rab11 family of small GTPases, along with the Rab11-family interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs), are critical regulators of intracellular vesicle trafficking and recycling. We have identified a point mutation of Threonine-197 site to an Alanine in Rab11-FIP1A, which causes a dramatic dominant negative phenotype when expressed in HeLa cells. The normally perinuclear distribution of GFP-Rab11-FIP1A was condensed into a membranous cisternum with almost no GFP-Rab11-FIP1A(T197A) remaining outside of this central locus. Also, this condensed GFP-FIP1A(T197A) altered the distribution of proteins in the Rab11a recycling pathway including endogenous Rab11a, Rab11-FIP1C, and transferrin receptor (CD71). Furthermore, this condensed GFP-FIP1A(T197A)-containing structure exhibited little movement in live HeLa cells. Expression of GFP-FIP1A(T197A) caused a strong blockade of transferrin recycling. Treatment of cells expressing GFP-FIP1A(T197A) with nocodazole did not disperse the Rab11a-containing recycling system. We also found that Rab5 and EEA1 were accumulated in membranes by GFP-Rab11-FIP1A but Rab4 was unaffected, suggesting that a direct pathway may exist from early endosomes into the Rab11a-containing recycling system. Our study of a potent inhibitory trafficking mutation in Rab11-FIP1A shows that Rab11-FIP1A associates with and regulates trafficking at an early step in the process of membrane recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Proliferating progenitor cells undergo changes in competence to give rise to post-mitotic progeny of specialized function. These cell-fate transitions typically involve dynamic regulation of gene expression by histone methyltransferase (HMT) complexes. However, the composition, roles, and regulation of these assemblies in regulating cell-fate decisions in vivo are poorly understood. Using unbiased affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified the uncharacterized C2H2-like zinc finger protein ZNF644 as a G9a/GLP-interacting protein and co-regulator of histone methylation. In zebrafish, functional characterization of ZNF644 orthologs, znf644a and znf644b, revealed complementary roles in regulating G9a/H3K9me2-mediated gene silencing during neurogenesis. The non-overlapping requirements for znf644a and znf644b during retinal differentiation demarcate critical aspects of retinal differentiation programs regulated by differential G9a-ZNF644 associations, such as transitioning proliferating progenitor cells toward differentiation. Collectively, our data point to ZNF644 as a critical co-regulator of G9a/H3K9me2-mediated gene silencing during neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Human hepatocytes are extensively needed in drug discovery and development. Stem cell-derived hepatocytes are expected to be an improved and continuous model of human liver to study drug candidates. Generation of endoderm-derived hepatocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, is a complex, challenging process requiring specific signals from soluble factors and insoluble matrices at each developmental stage. In this study, we used human liver progenitor HepaRG-derived acellular matrix (ACM) as a hepatic progenitor-specific matrix to induce hepatic commitment of hPSC-derived definitive endoderm (DE) cells. The DE cells showed much better attachment to the HepaRG ACM than other matrices tested and then differentiated towards hepatic cells, which expressed hepatocyte-specific makers. We demonstrate that Matrigel overlay induced hepatocyte phenotype and inhibited biliary epithelial differentiation in two hPSC lines studied. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the HepaRG ACM, a hepatic progenitor-specific matrix, plays an important role in the hepatic differentiation of hPSCs.

Abstract: Human prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heterogeneous and multifactorial disease. Current clinical biomarkers are not sufficiently accurate, thus being unable to predict the clinical outcome. Therefore, searching for new biomarkers aiming to improve diagnosis, prognosis and therapy is still required. In this study, we performed 3D Cell-SELEX against PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, a novel strategy to select specific nucleic acid ligands against spheroid cells in 3D cell culture. This original system combines Cell-SELEX, a process that exploits the cellular structure to generate specific ligands, and 3D cell culture, an approach that mimics the tissue microenvironment in vitro. In the first round of 3D Cell-SELEX, a negative selection against RWPE-1, non-tumor cell line, was performed to subtract non-tumor specific aptamers. The supernatant was used in eight additional rounds of selection, which were performed against PC-3 cell line. After nine selection cycles, eight PC-3 specific RNA aptamers were selected and sequenced. The aptamers presented sizes between 20 and 50 nucleotides-long, with low free energy (∆G<−13.6), which contributed for their spontaneous folding and high stability. Furthermore, our results showed the aptamer A4 as a specific ligand to prostate tumor cells, with dissociation constant in the nanomolar scale. Therefore, the novel 3D Cell-SELEX procedure improved the selection of PCa cell-surface ligands and the aptamer A4 has shown potential for the identification of prostate tumor cells, suggesting the application of this molecule in further screening assays for PCa.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent self-renewing precursors with the capacity to differentiate into all adult blood cell lineages. HSC development is a highly orchestrated process regulated by multiple transcription factors and signaling pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is an additional essential component of HSC development. Powerful genetic and imaging approaches, combined with conservation of mammalian programs, have made zebrafish a prominent model for the study of HSC production. This chapter summarizes approaches that have been used to identify epigenetic regulators of HSC development in zebrafish and highlights additional strategies that are likely to facilitate progress in this promising field.

The T-box transcription factor TBX3 has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and cardiogenesis. We have recently discovered that forced TBX3 expression in embryonic stem cells promotes mesendoderm specification directly by activating key lineage specification factors and indirectly by enhancing paracrine NODAL signalling. Interestingly, aberrant TBX3 expression is associated with breast cancer and melanoma formation. In other cancers, loss of TBX3 expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype e.g. in gastric and cervical cancer. The precise function of TBX3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains to be determined. In the current study we provide conclusive evidence for TBX3 overexpression in pancreatic cancer samples as compared to healthy tissue. While proliferation remains unaltered, forced TBX3 expression strongly increases migration and invasion, but also angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we describe the TBX3-dependency of cancer stem cells that perpetuate themselves through an autocrine TBX3–ACTIVIN/NODAL signalling loop to sustain stemness. Thus, TBX3 is a new key player among pluripotency-related genes driving cancer formation.

Abstract: The guanine nucleotide protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily represents the largest class of membrane protein in the human genome. More than a half of all GPCRs are dedicated to interact with odorants and are termed odorant-receptors (ORs). Linda Buck and Richard Axel, the Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine in 2004, first cloned and characterized the gene family that encode ORs, establishing the foundations to the understanding of the molecular basis for odor recognition. In the last decades, a lot of progress has been done to unravel the functioning of the sense of smell. This chapter gives a general overview of the topic of olfactory receptor signaling and reviews recent advances in this field.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is linked to severe birth defects, but mother-to-fetus transmission routes are unknown. We infected different primary cell types from mid- and late-gestation placentas and explants from first-trimester chorionic villi with the prototype Ugandan and a recently isolated Nicaraguan ZIKV strain. ZIKV infects primary human placental cells and explants—cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and Hofbauer cells in chorionic villi and amniotic epithelial cells and trophoblast progenitors in amniochorionic membranes—that express Axl, Tyro3, and/or TIM1 viral entry cofactors. ZIKV produced NS3 and E proteins and generated higher viral titers in amniotic epithelial cells from mid-gestation compared to late-gestation placentas. Duramycin, a peptide that binds phosphatidylethanolamine in enveloped virions and precludes TIM1 binding, reduced ZIKV infection in placental cells and explants. Our results suggest that ZIKV spreads from basal and parietal decidua to chorionic villi and amniochorionic membranes and that targeting TIM1 could suppress infection at the uterine-placental interface.

Abstract: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is known to induce phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from contractile to a pathological synthetic state, which played an essential role in proliferation of VSMCs. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) contributes to the proliferation of VSMCs when induced by PDGF. Here, we investigated the probable role of Shh in PDGF-induced VSMC dedifferentiation and its underlying mechanisms. We found that PDGF stimulated Shh expression in VSMCs, which was mediated by activation of PDGFRβ/ERK1/2 cell signaling pathway. Further, we found PDGF-induced VSMC phenotypic modulation was accompanied by up-regulation of Shh/Gli family zinc finger 2 (Gli2) signaling and Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). When inhibited Shh in the presence of PDGF, the expressions of KLF4 and VSMC dedifferentiation markers were down-regulated and the effect of PDGF in inducing VSMC dedifferentiation was blocked. In the absence of PDGF, Shh signaling activation increased the expression of KLF4 and promoted VSMC dedifferentiation. The results indicate Shh participated in the regulation of PDGF-induced VSMC dedifferentiation. Finally, we found that KLF4 was closely involved in this process. On inhibition of KLF4, PDGF induced VSMC dedifferentiation was abrogated, even in the presence of Shh. Taken together, the results provide critical insights into the newly discovered role of Shh in phenotypic modulation of VSMCs which depends on KLF4.

Abstract: The macrophages have different subtypes with different functions in immune response and disease. It has been generally accepted that M1 macrophages are responsible for stimulation of immune system and inflammation while M2 macrophages play a role in tissue repair. Irrespective of the type, macrophage functions depend on actin cytoskeleton, which is under the control of small GTPase RhoA pathway and its downstream effector ROCK1. We generated RhoA-deleted macrophages and compared the effect of RhoA deletion on M0, M1 and M2 macrophage phenotype. Our studies showed that, unexpectedly, the RhoA deletion did not eliminate macrophage ROCK1 expression and increased ROCK1 activity. The RhoA deletion effect on macrophage phenotype, structure and polarity was different for each subtype. Moreover, our study indicates that the up-regulation of ROCK1 activity in RhoA-deleted macrophages and macrophage phenotype/polarity are dependent on non-apoptotic Caspase-3 and are sensitive to Caspase-3 inhibition. These novel findings will revise/complement our understanding of RhoA pathway regulation of cell structure and polarity.

Abstract: Studies on the role of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on tumor growth have reported both a tumor promoting and a suppressive effect. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of MSC isolated from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord (WJMSC) on lung cancer stem cells (LCSC) derived from human lung tumors: two adenocarcinomas (AC) and two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). LCSC derived from SCC and AC expressed, to varying extents, the more relevant stem cell markers. The effect of WJMSC on LCSC was investigated in vitro using conditioned medium (WJ-CM): a proliferation increase in AC-LCSC was observed, with an increase in the ALDH+ and in the CD133+ cell population. By contrast, WJ-CM hampered the growth of SCC-LCSC, with an increase in the pre-G1 phase indicating the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the ALDH+ and CD133+ population was also reduced. In vivo, subcutaneous co-transplantation of AC-LCSC/WJMSC generated larger tumors than AC-LCSC alone, characterized by an increased percentage of CD133+ and CD166+ cells. By contrast, co-transplantation of WJMSC and SCC-LCSC did not affect the tumor size. Our results strongly suggest that WJMSC exert, both in vitro and in vivo, contrasting effects on LCSC derived from different lung tumor subtypes.

Abstract: Cancer often arises by the constitutive activation of mitogenic pathways by mutations in stem cells. Eph receptors are unusual in that although they regulate the proliferation of stem/progenitor cells in many adult organs, they typically fail to transform cells. Multiple ephrins and Eph receptors are often co-expressed and are thought to be redundant, but we here describe an unexpected dichotomy with two homologous ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, regulating specifically migration or proliferation in the intestinal stem cell niche. We demonstrate that the combined activity of two different coexpressed Eph receptors of the A and B class assembled into common signaling clusters in response to ephrin-B2 is required for mitogenic signaling. The requirement of two different Eph receptors to convey mitogenic signals identifies a new type of cooperation within this receptor family and helps explain why constitutive activation of a single receptor fails to transform cells.

Abstract: Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity involves in overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. Our previous data demonstrated that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, has a protective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has potential therapeutic value for oxidative stress-induced neural damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADMA provides protection against the neurotoxicity of glutamate by regulating endogenous H2S generation. In the present study, we found that ADMA prevented glutamate-triggered decrease in endogenous H2S generation in PC12 cells and reversed glutamate-induced suppression in the expression and activity of cystathionine-β-synthetase (CBS), the predominant enzymatic source of H2S in PC12 cells. Furthermore, AOAA, a potent inhibitor of CBS, significantly abolished the protective action of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells. We also showed that ADMA suppressed glutamate-elicited NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction in PC12 cells. These data indicate that the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is by promoting endogenous H2S generation, resulting from suppression in NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow underlies the ineffective hematopoiesis characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is abnormally activated in MDS and may be involved in excessive programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of MDS. TLRs expression and global histone H3/H4 acetylation were analyzed in bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells from 20 lower-risk and 20 higher-risk MDS patients and 10 healthy controls. Apoptosis of BM CD34+ cells was examined by flow cytometry, and its correlation to histone acetylation and the expression of TLR2 and β-arrestin1 (β-arr1), measured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay and qRT-PCR, was assessed. TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6 expression and H4 acetylation levels were higher in lower-risk MDS patients than in higher-risk MDS patients or controls, and TLR2 expression and H4 acetylation levels were positively correlated with an increased rate of apoptosis. Lower-risk MDS was associated with increased β-arr1 expression and histone acetyltransferase p300 activity. In in vitro-cultured primary normal and lower-risk MDS CD34+ cells, TLR2 activation-induced apoptosis was mediated by the upregulation of β-arr1 leading to the recruitment of p300 and increased histone H4 acetylation. The nuclear accumulation of βarr1 following TLR2 activation promote H4 acetylation at specific target gene promoters and may thus affect transcription of target genes in BM CD34+ cells. The mechanisms underlying the deregulation of TLR2 and increased apoptosis in MDS may involve the β-arr1 mediated recruitment of p300 leading to increased levels of histone H4 acetylation.

Abstract: Copper is an essential trace element, however, excess copper is harmful to human health. Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson disease, and oxidative stress induces accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in proper protein folding, and that accumulation of misfolded proteins disturbs ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. However, copper-induced ER homeostasis disturbance has not been fully clarified. We treated human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and immortalized-human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of ultra-structure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson disease. These findings show that ER stress plays a pivotal role in Wilson disease, and suggests that chemical chaperones may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Wilson disease.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are derived from a peri-implantation embryo, are routinely cultured in medium containing diabetic glucose (Glc) concentrations. While pregnancy in women with pre-existing diabetes may result in small embryos, whether such high Glc levels affect ESC growth remains uncovered. We show here that long-term exposure of ESCs to diabetic Glc inhibits their proliferation, thereby mimicking in vivo findings. Molecularly, Glc exposure increased oxidative stress and activated Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a), promoting increased expression and activity of the ROS-removal enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase and the cell-cycle inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1. Diabetic Glc also promoted β-catenin nuclear localization and the formation of a complex with FOXO3a that localized to the promoters of Sod2, p21cip1, and potentially p27kip1. Our results demonstrate an adaptive response to increases in oxidative stress induced by diabetic Glc conditions that promote ROS removal, but also result in a decrease in proliferation.

Abstract: Tendon-derived stem cell (TDSC) is a subpopulation of residing stem cells within the intact tendon tissues, with the capacities of self-renewal, clonogenicity, and three-lineage differentiation. Compared with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), TDSCs are superior for tendon injuries repair as they remain some tendon tissue-specific differentiation properties. In the present study, TDSC was found to undergo spontaneous tenogenic differentiation in which the expression of tenogenic markers were increased while the expression of stemness markers decreased with time in TDSCs culture (without tenogenic induction medium). The further collagen synthesis ability was correspondingly increased during this process. After a longer period of culture, the monolayer of TDSCs formed a “3D” layers with rich extracellular matrices of typical tendon tissues. In addition, the key tenogenic transcription factors, such as Scx, Mkx, Egr1 and Eya1 were all up-regulated in this process. Finally, we compared the spontaneous tenogenic differentiation with TGF-β1-induced tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs, and the results showed that the spontaneous tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs was general character of TDSCs, similar to but weaker than the effect of TDSCs under tenogenic induction. Taken together, the present study identified that TDSCs had the potential of spontaneous tenogenic differentiation, which may be a better cell source for the treatment of tendon injury.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a chaperone that normally scans the proteome and initiates the turnover of some proteins (termed clients) by linking them to the degradation pathways. This activity is critical to normal protein homeostasis, yet it appears to fail in diseases associated with abnormal protein accumulation. It is not clear why Hsp70 promotes client degradation under some conditions, while sparing that protein under others. Here, we used a combination of chemical biology and genetic strategies to systematically perturb the affinity of Hsp70 for the model client, tau. This approach revealed that tight complexes between Hsp70 and tau were associated with enhanced turnover while transient interactions favored tau retention. These results suggest that client affinity is one important parameter governing Hsp70-mediated quality control.

Abstract: Inositol polyphosphates represent a group of differentially phosphorylated inositol metabolites, many of which are implicated to regulate diverse cellular processes such as calcium mobilization, vesicular trafficking, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. The metabolic network of these compounds is complex and tightly regulated by various kinases and phosphatases present predominantly in the cytosol. Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (Minpp1) is the only known endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal enzyme that hydrolyzes various inositol polyphosphates in vitro as well as in vivo conditions. However, access of the Minpp1 to cytosolic substrates has not yet been demonstrated clearly and hence its physiological function. In this study, we examined a potential role for Minpp1 in ER stress-induced apoptosis. We generated a custom antibody and characterized its specificity to study the expression of Minpp1 protein in multiple mammalian cells under experimentally induced cellular stress conditions. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the expression of Minpp1 in response to a variety of cellular stress conditions. The protein expression was corroborated with the expression of its mRNA and enzymatic activity. Further, in an attempt to link the role of Minpp1 to apoptotic stress, we studied the effect of Minpp1 expression on apoptosis following silencing of the Minpp1 gene by its specific siRNA. Our results suggest an attenuation of apoptotic parameters following knockdown of Minpp1. Thus, in addition to its known role in inositol polyphosphate metabolism, we have identified a novel role for Minpp1 as a stress-responsive protein. In summary, our results provide, for the first time, a probable link between ER stress-induced apoptosis and Minpp1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
RIP3-dependent necroptosis has recently garnered significant interest because of the unique signaling mechanisms and pathologic functions involved in this process. Accordingly, a number of chemical screens have identified several effective small-molecule inhibitors that specifically block necroptosis. Here, we report the discovery that kongensin A (KA), a natural product isolated from Croton kongensis, is a potent inhibitor of necroptosis and an inducer of apoptosis. Using a new bioorthogonal ligation method (TQ ligation), we reveal that the direct cellular target of KA is heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Further studies demonstrate that KA covalently binds to a previously uncharacterized cysteine 420 in the middle domain of HSP90 and dissociates HSP90 from its cochaperone CDC37, which leads to inhibition of RIP3-dependent necroptosis and promotion of apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that KA is an effective HSP90 inhibitor that has potential anti-necroptosis and anti-inflammation applications.

Abstract: Directed differentiation of iPS cells toward various tissue progenitors has been the focus of recent research. Therefore, generation of tissue-specific reporter iPS cell lines provides better understanding of developmental stages in iPS cells. This technical report describes an efficient strategy for generation and validation of knock-in reporter lines in human iPS cells using the Cas9-nickase system. Here, we have generated a knock-in human iPS cell line for the early myogenic lineage specification gene of PAX7. By introduction of site-specific double-stranded breaks (DSB) in the genomic locus of PAX7 using CRISPR/Cas9 nickase pairs, a 2A-GFP reporter with selection markers has been incorporated before the stop codon of the PAX7 gene at the last exon. After positive and negative selection, single cell-derived human iPS clones have been isolated and sequenced for in-frame positioning of the reporter construct. Finally, by using a nuclease-dead Cas9 activator (dCas9-VP160) system, the promoter region of PAX7 has been targeted for transient gene induction to validate the GFP reporter activity. This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and immunostaining for PAX7 and GFP. This technical report provides a practical guideline for generation and validation of knock-in reporters using CRISPR/Cas9 system.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae depends on effector proteins secreted by its type III secretion system for the pathogenesis of plants. The majority of these effector proteins are known suppressors of immunity, but their plant targets remain elusive. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model host, we report that the HopE1 effector uses the host calcium sensor, calmodulin (CaM), as a co-factor to target the microtubule-associated protein 65 (MAP65), an important component of the microtubule network. HopE1 interacted with MAP65 in a CaM-dependent manner, resulting in MAP65-GFP dissociation from microtubules. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing HopE1 had reduced secretion of the immunity protein PR-1 compared to wild–type plants. Additionally, Arabidopsis map65-1 mutants were immune deficient and were more susceptible to P. syringae. Our results suggest a virulence strategy in which a pathogen effector is activated by host calmodulin to target MAP65 and the microtubule network, thereby inhibiting cell wall-based extracellular immunity.

Zebrafish are highly amenable to microscopic observation of the processes governing maternal germ cell specification because early embryos are transparent, and the germ line is specified rapidly (within 4–5h post fertilization). Advantages of zebrafish over other models used to study vertebrate germ cell formation include their genetic tractability, the large numbers of progeny, and the easily manipulable genome, all of which make zebrafish an ideal system for studying the genetic regulators and cellular basis of germ cell formation and maintenance. Classical molecular biology techniques, including expression analysis through in situ hybridization and forward genetic screens, have laid the foundation for our understanding of germ cell development in zebrafish. In this chapter, we discuss some of these classic techniques, as well as recent cutting-edge methodologies that have improved our ability to visualize the process of germ cell specification and differentiation, and the tracking of specific molecules involved in these processes. Additionally, we discuss traditional and novel technologies for manipulating the zebrafish genome to identify new components through loss-of-function studies of putative germ cell regulators. Together with the numerous aforementioned advantages of zebrafish as a genetic model for studying development, we believe these new techniques will continue to advance zebrafish to the forefront for investigation of the molecular regulators of germ cell specification and germ line biology.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the autophagy gene EPG5 are linked to the multisystem human disease Vici syndrome, which is characterized in part by pulmonary abnormalities, including recurrent infections. We found that Epg5-deficient mice exhibited elevated baseline innate immune cellular and cytokine-based lung inflammation and were resistant to lethal influenza virus infection. Lung transcriptomics, bone marrow transplantation experiments, and analysis of cellular cytokine expression indicated that Epg5 plays a role in lung physiology through its function in macrophages. Deletion of other autophagy genes including Atg14, Fip200, Atg5, and Atg7 in myeloid cells also led to elevated basal lung inflammation and influenza resistance. This suggests that Epg5 and other Atg genes function in macrophages to limit innate immune inflammation in the lung. Disruption of this normal homeostatic dampening of lung inflammation results in increased resistance to influenza, suggesting that normal homeostatic mechanisms that limit basal tissue inflammation support some infectious diseases.

Abstract: Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to be the main manifestation in the pathology of ischemia reperfusion injury, and by restoring its functional activity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel endogenous gaseotransmitter renders cardioprotection. Given that interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM) mitochondria are the two main types in the heart, the present study investigates the specific H2S-mediated action on IFM and SSM during ischemic reperfusion in the Langendorff rat heart model. Rats were randomly divided into five groups, namely normal, ischemic control, reperfusion control (I/R), ischemic post-conditioning (POC), and H2S post-conditioning (POC_H2S). In reperfusion control, cardiac contractility decreased, and lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and infracted size increased compared to both normal and ischemic group. In hearts post-conditioned with H2S and the classical method improved cardiac mechanical function and decreased cardiac markers in the perfusate and infarct size significantly. Both POC and POC_H2S exerts its cardioprotective effect of preserving the IFM, as evident by significant improvement in electron transport chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial respiration. The in vitro action of H2S on IFM and SSM from normal and I/R rat heart supports H2S and mediates cardioprotection via IFM preservation. Our study indicates that IFM play an important role in POC_H2S mediated cardioprotection from reperfusion injury.

Abstract: The complex process of wound healing is a major problem associated with diabetes, venous or arterial disease, old age and infection. A wide range of pharmacological effects including anabolic, anti-diabetic and hepato-protective activities have been attributed to Ecdysterone. In earlier studies, Ecdysterone has been shown to modulate eNOS and iNOS expression in diabetic animals and activate osteogenic differentiation through the Extracellular-signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway in periodontal ligament stem cells. However, in the wound healing process, Ecdysterone has only been shown to enhance granulation tissue formation in rabbits. There have been no studies to date, which elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the complex cellular process involved in wound healing. The present study, demonstrates a novel interaction between the phytosteroid Ecdysterone and Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), in an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-dependent manner, thereby promoting cell proliferation, cell spreading and cell migration. These observations were further supported by the 4-amino-5-methylamino- 2′ ,7′ -difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF FM) fluorescence assay which indicated that Ecdysterone activates NOS resulting in increased Nitric Oxide (NO) production. Additionally, studies with inhibitors of both the EGFR and ERK, demonstrated that Ecdysterone activates NOS through modulation of EGFR and ERK. These results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that Ecdysterone enhances Nitric Oxide production and modulates complex cellular processes by activating ERK1/2 through the EGF pathway.

Abstract: Gastrin is absent in most normal adult pancreatic tissues but is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues. Although Gastrin expression was reported to be associated with tumor proliferation in human pancreatic cancer, studies on the relationship between Gastrin and tumor metastasis in pancreatic cancer are rare. In this study, we performed an analysis to determine the effects of Gastrin on modulating the side populations, cell proportion and tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity and explored its mechanisms in pancreatic cancer. We indicated that Gastrin and ABCG2 were widely expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and overexpressed in cancer tissues. Gastrin induced ABCG2 expression, and this effect was mediated by NF-κB activation. Gastrin regulated the SP proportion of BxPC-3 cells via modulating ABCG2 expression. Through the regulation of the functions of NF-κB/ABCG2, Gastrin functionally promoted the migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cell. The present study indicated that Gastrin induced ABCG2 expression by activating NF-κB and thereby modulated the SP proportion, tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity in pancreatic cancer. Gastrin could serve as an effective therapeutic target for the metastasis of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Beta-catenin plays a key role in transducing Wnt signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Here we characterize an unusual subcellular distribution of beta-catenin in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, wherein beta-catenin localizes to the cytoplasm and membrane but atypically did not relocate to the nucleus after Wnt treatment. The inability of Wnt or the Wnt agonist LiCl to induce nuclear localization of beta-catenin was not due to defective nuclear transport, as the transport machinery was intact and ectopic GFP-beta-catenin displayed rapid nuclear entry in living cells. The mislocalization is explained by a shift in the retention of beta-catenin from nucleus to cytoplasm. The reduced nuclear retention is caused by unusually low expression of lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) transcription factors. The reconstitution of LEF-1 or TCF4 expression rescued nuclear localization of beta-catenin in Wnt treated cells. In the cytoplasm, beta-catenin accumulated in recycling endosomes, golgi and beta-COP-positive coatomer complexes. The peripheral association with endosomes diminished after Wnt treatment, potentially releasing β-catenin into the cytoplasm for nuclear entry. We propose that in MCF-7 and perhaps other breast cancer cells, beta-catenin may contribute to cytoplasmic functions such as ER-golgi transport, in addition to its transactivation role in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cell (PGC) specification occurs early in development. PGC specifiers have been identified in Drosophila, mouse, and human but remained elusive in most animals. Here we identify the RNA-binding protein Dnd as a critical PGC specifier in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Dnd depletion specifically abolished PGCs, and its overexpression boosted PGCs. We established a single-cell culture procedure enabling lineage tracing in vitro. We show that individual blastomeres from cleavage embryos at the 32- and 64-cell stages are capable of PGC production in culture. Importantly, Dnd overexpression increases PGCs via increasing PGC precursors. Strikingly, dnd RNA forms prominent particles that segregate asymmetrically. Dnd concentrates in germ plasm and stabilizes germ plasm RNA. Therefore, Dnd is a critical specifier of fish PGCs and utilizes particle partition as a previously unidentified mechanism for asymmetric segregation. These findings offer insights into PGC specification and manipulation in medaka as a lower vertebrate model.

Abstract: HSP90 is a molecular chaperone essential for stability, activity and intracellular sorting of many proteins, including oncoproteins, such as tyrosine kinases, transcription factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Therefore, inhibitors of HSP90 are being investigated for their potential as anti-cancer drugs. Here we show that the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 induced degradation of the fusion oncoprotein FOP2-FGFR1 in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, KG-1a. Concordantly, downstream signaling cascades, such as STAT1, STAT3 and PLCγ were abrogated. At concentrations that caused FOP2-FGFR1 degradation and signaling abrogation, NVP-AUY922 treatment caused significant cell death and inhibition of proliferation of KG-1a cells in vitro. In an animal model for AML, NVP-AUY922 administrated alone showed no anti-leukemic activity. However, when NVP-AUY922 was administered in combination with cytarabine, the two compounds showed significant synergistic anti-leukemic activity in vivo. Thus NVP-AUY922 and cytarabine combination therapy might be a prospective strategy for AML treatment.

Abstract: The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is a powerful tool for genome editing in numerous organisms. However, the system is typically used for gene editing throughout the entire organism. Tissue and temporal specific mutagenesis is often desirable to determine gene function in a specific stage or tissue and to bypass undesired consequences of global mutations. We have developed the CRISPR/Cas system for conditional mutagenesis in transgenic zebrafish using tissue-specific and/or inducible expression of Cas9 and U6-driven expression of sgRNA. To allow mutagenesis of multiple targets, we have isolated four distinct U6 promoters and designed Golden Gate vectors to easily assemble transgenes with multiple sgRNAs. We provide experimental details on the reagents and applications for multiplex conditional mutagenesis in zebrafish.

Abstract: The biology of glioblastoma invasion and its mechanisms are poorly understood. We demonstrate using time-lapse microscopy that grafting of glioblastoma (GBM) tumorspheres into rodent brain slices results in experimental ex vivo tumors with invasive properties that recapitulate the invasion observed after orthotopic transplantation into the rodent brain. The migratory movements and mitotic patterns were clearly modified by signals extrinsic to the invading cells. The cells migrated away from the tumorspheres, and removal of the spheres reduced the directed invasive movement. The cell cultures contained different populations of invasive cells that had distinct morphology and invasive behavior patterns. Grafts of the most invasive GBM culture contained 91±8% cells with an invasive phenotype, characterized by small soma with a distinct leading process. Conversely, the majority of cells in less invasive GBM grafts were phenotypically heterogeneous: only 6.3±4.1% of the cells had the invasive phenotype. Grafts of highly and moderately invasive cultures had different proportions of cells that advanced into the brain slice parenchyma during the observation period: 89.2±2.2% and 23.1±6.8%, respectively. In grafts with moderately invasive properties, most of the cells (76.8±6.8%) invading the surrounding brain tissue returned to the tumor bulk or stopped centrifugal migration. Our data suggest that the invasion of individual GBM tumors can be conditioned by the prevalence of a cell fraction with particular invasive morphology and by signaling between the tumor core and invasive cells. These findings can be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies that target the invasive GBM cells.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane (TM) proteins that play a key role in human physiology. The GPCR superfamily comprises about 800 members, classified into several classes, with rhodopsin-like Class A being the largest and most studied thus far. A huge component of the human repertoire consists of the chemosensory GPCRs, including ∼400 odorant receptors, 25 bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs), which are thought to guard the organism from consuming poisons, and sweet and umami TAS1R heteromers, which indicate the nutritive value of food. The location of the binding site of TAS2Rs is similar to that of Class A GPCRs. However, most of the known bitter ligands are agonists, with only a few antagonists documented thus far. The agonist-to-antagonist ratios of Class A GPCRs vary, but in general are much lower than for TAS2Rs. For a set of well-studied GPCRs, a gradual change in agonists-to-antagonists ratios is observed when comparing low (10μM)- and high (10nM)-affinity ligand sets from ChEMBL and the DrugBank set of drugs. This shift reflects pharmaceutical bias toward the therapeutically desirable pharmacology for each of these GPCRs, while the 10μM sets possibly represent the native tendency of the receptors toward either agonists or antagonists. Analyzing ligand–GPCR interactions in 56 X-ray structures representative of currently available structural data, we find that the N-terminus, TM1 and TM2 are more involved in binding of antagonists than of agonists. On the other hand, ECL2 tends to be more involved in binding of agonists. This is of interest, since TAS2Rs harbor variations on the typical Class A sequence motifs, including the absence of the ECL2-TM3 disulfide bridge. This suggests an alternative mode of regulation of conformational states for TAS2Rs, with potentially less stabilized inactive state. The comparison of TAS2Rs and Class A GPCRs structural features and the pharmacology of the their ligands highlights the intricacies of GPCR architecture and provides a framework for rational design of new ligands.

Abstract: In the past 20years, appreciation for the varied roles of proteoglycans (PGs), which are specific types of sugar-coated proteins, has increased dramatically. PGs in the extracellular matrix were long known to impart structural functions to many tissues, especially articular cartilage, which cushions bones and allows mobility at skeletal joints. Indeed, osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease associated with loss of PGs in articular cartilage. Today, however, PGs have a demonstrated role in cell biological processes, such as growth factor signalling, prompting new perspectives on the etiology of PG-associated diseases. Here, we review diseases associated with defects in PG synthesis and sulfation, also highlighting current understanding of the underlying genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology. Since most research has analyzed a class of PGs called heparan sulfate PGs, more attention is paid here to studies of chondroitin sulfate PGs (CSPGs), which are abundant in cartilage. Interestingly, CSPG synthesis is tightly linked to the cell biological processes of secretion and lysosomal degradation, suggesting that these systems may be linked genetically. Animal models of loss of CSPG function have revealed CSPGs to impact skeletal development. Specifically, our work from a mutagenesis screen in zebrafish led to the hypothesis that cartilage PGs normally delay the timing of endochondral ossification. Finally, we outline emerging approaches in zebrafish that may revolutionize the study of cartilage PG function, including transgenic methods and novel imaging techniques. Our recent work with X-ray fluorescent imaging, for example, enables direct correlation of PG function with PG-dependent biological processes.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a class of chaperones with low molecular weight, feathered by a C-terminal α-crystallin domain (ACD). They participate in reestablishing the stability of partially denatured proteins and therefore contribute to cellular homeostasis. In this work, we identified a sHsp homolog (designated as sHsp19) from Haliotis discus hannai, an economically important farmed mollusk in East Asia. sHsp19 possesses a sHsp hallmark domain, which exhibits the typical fold of ACD as revealed by a three-dimensional model constructed through an iterative threading assembly refinement method. The amino acid sequence sHsp19 shares low identities with any other known sHsps, with percentages below 35 %. Besides, sHsp19 shows relatively distant phylogenetic relationships with sHsps of various mollusks, including two other identified sHsps of abalone subspecies. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of sHsp19 occurred in multiple tissues. Upon exposure to thermal, oxidative, and multiple toxic metal stresses, the level of sHsp19 mRNA was rapidly elevated in a persistent fashion, with the maximum increase up to 170.58-, 405.84-, and 361.96-fold, respectively. These results indicate sHsp is a novel sHsp that possesses the distinguishing structural feature of sHsps but has remote homologies with known sHsps. It is likely to be important in stress adaptation of abalone and may be applied as a bioindicator for monitoring pollution or detrimental changes of environment in abalone culture.

Abstract: YB-1 is a multifunctional protein, which has been shown to correlate with resistance to treatment of various tumor types. This study investigated the expression and biologic function of YB-1 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression statuses of YB-1 and pYB-1S102 were reversely correlated with the clinical outcomes of DLBCL patients. In addition, we found that YB-1 could promote the proliferation of DLBCL cells by accelerating the G1/S transition. Ectopic expression of YB-1 could markedly increase the expression of cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Furthermore, we found that adhesion of DLBCL cells to fibronectin (FN) could increase YB-1 phosphorylation at Ser102 and pYB-1S102 nuclear translocation. In addition, overexpression of YB-1 could increase the adhesion of DLBCL cells to FN. Intriguingly, we found that YB-1 overexpression could confer drug resistance through cell-adhesion dependent and independent mechanisms in DLBCL. Silencing of YB-1 could sensitize DLBCL cells to mitoxantrone and overcome cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype in an AKT-dependent manner.

Abstract: This study investigated the pro-proliferative effect of hyaluronic acid (HA) on human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and the underlying mechanisms. Treatment with HA increased cell population growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Analyses by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry revealed that HA did not change the cytophenotypes of hAMSCs. Additionally, the osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation capabilities of these hAMSCs were retained after HA treatment. Moreover, HA increased the mRNA expressions of wnt1, wnt3a, wnt8a, cyclin D1, Ki-67, and β-catenin as well as the protein level of β-catenin and cyclin D1 in hAMSCs; and the nuclear localization of β-catenin was also enhanced. Furthermore, the pro-proliferative effect of HA and up-regulated expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-associated proteins - wnt3a, β-catenin and cyclin D1 in hAMSCs were significantly inhibited upon pre-treatment with Wnt-C59, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These results suggest that HA may positively regulate hAMSCs proliferation through regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-autonomous defense mechanisms are potent strategies that protect individual cells against intracellular pathogens. The Rab-family GTPase Rab32 was previously shown to restrict the intracellular human pathogen Salmonella Typhi, but its potential broader role in antimicrobial defense remains unknown. We show that Rab32 represents a general cell-autonomous, antimicrobial defense that is counteracted by two Salmonella effectors. Mice lacking Rab-32 or its nucleotide exchange factor BLOC-3 are permissive to S. Typhi infection and exhibit increased susceptibility to S. Typhimurium. S. Typhimurium counters this defense pathway by delivering two type III secretion effectors, SopD2, a Rab32 GAP, and GtgE, a specific Rab32 protease. An S. Typhimurium mutant strain lacking these two effectors exhibits markedly reduced virulence, which is fully restored in BLOC-3-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that a cell-autonomous, Rab32-dependent host defense pathway plays a central role in the defense against vacuolar pathogens and describe a mechanism evolved by a bacterial pathogen to counter it.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoiesis is a multistage process involving the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells into distinct mature cell lineages. Here we present Haemopedia, an atlas of murine gene-expression data containing 54 hematopoietic cell types, covering all the mature lineages in hematopoiesis. We include rare cell populations such as eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and megakaryocytes, and a broad collection of progenitor and stem cells. We show that lineage branching and maturation during hematopoiesis can be reconstructed using the expression patterns of small sets of genes. We also have identified genes with enriched expression in each of the mature blood cell lineages, many of which show conserved lineage-enriched expression in human hematopoiesis. We have created an online web portal called Haemosphere to make analyses of Haemopedia and other blood cell transcriptional datasets easier. This resource provides simple tools to interrogate gene-expression-based relationships between hematopoietic cell types and genes of interest.

Abstract: Summary
The KDM5/JARID1 family of Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent demethylases removes methyl groups from methylated lysine 4 of histone H3. Accumulating evidence supports a role for KDM5 family members as oncogenic drivers. We compare the in vitro inhibitory properties and binding affinity of ten diverse compounds with all four family members, and present the crystal structures of the KDM5A-linked Jumonji domain in complex with eight of these inhibitors in the presence of Mn(II). All eight inhibitors structurally examined occupy the binding site of α-ketoglutarate, but differ in their specific binding interactions, including the number of ligands involved in metal coordination. We also observed inhibitor-induced conformational changes in KDM5A, particularly those residues involved in the binding of α-ketoglutarate, the anticipated peptide substrate, and intramolecular interactions. We discuss how particular chemical moieties contribute to inhibitor potency and suggest strategies that might be utilized in the successful design of selective and potent epigenetic inhibitors.

Expression of hsrω-RNAi transgene prior to heat shock specifically compromises accumulation of heat shock-induced Hsp70 in Drosophila melanogaster,

Abstract: A delayed organismic lethality was reported in Drosophila following heat shock when developmentally active and stress-inducible noncoding hsrω-n transcripts were down-regulated during heat shock through hs-GAL4-driven expression of the hsrω-RNAi transgene, despite the characteristic elevation of all heat shock proteins (Hsp), including Hsp70. Here, we show that hsrω-RNAi transgene expression prior to heat shock singularly prevents accumulation of Hsp70 in all larval tissues without affecting transcriptional induction of hsp70 genes and stability of their transcripts. Absence of the stress-induced Hsp70 accumulation was not due to higher levels of Hsc70 in hsrω-RNAi transgene-expressing tissues. Inhibition of proteasomal activity during heat shock restored high levels of the induced Hsp70, suggesting very rapid degradation of the Hsp70 even during the stress when hsrω-RNAi transgene was expressed ahead of heat shock. Unexpectedly, while complete absence of hsrω transcripts in hsrω66 homozygotes (hsrω-null) did not prevent high accumulation of heat shock-induced Hsp70, hsrω-RNAi transgene expression in hsrω-null background blocked Hsp70 accumulation. Nonspecific RNAi transgene expression did not affect Hsp70 induction. These observations reveal that, under certain conditions, the stress-induced Hsp70 can be selectively and rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation even during heat shock. In the present case, the selective degradation of Hsp70 does not appear to be due to down-regulation of the hsrω-n transcripts per se; rather, this may be an indirect effect of the expression of hsrω-RNAi transgene whose RNA products may titrate away some RNA-binding proteins which may also be essential for stability of the induced Hsp70.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are cell lines derived from the mammalian pre-implantation embryo. Here we assess the impact of derivation and culture conditions on both functional potency and ESC transcriptional identity. Individual ESCs cultured in either two small-molecule inhibitors (2i) or with knockout serum replacement (KOSR), but not serum, can generate high-level chimeras regardless of how these cells were derived. ESCs cultured in these conditions showed a transcriptional correlation with early pre-implantation embryos (E1.5–E3.5) and contributed to development from the 2-cell stage. Conversely, the transcriptome of serum-cultured ESCs correlated with later stages of development (E4.5), at which point embryonic cells are more restricted in their developmental potential. Thus, ESC culture systems are not equivalent, but support cell types that resemble distinct developmental stages. Cells derived in one condition can be reprogrammed to another developmental state merely by adaptation to another culture condition.

Abstract: Summary
Although pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into the hepatocyte lineages, such cells retain an immature phenotype. As the chromatin state of regulatory regions controls spatiotemporal gene expression during development, we evaluated changes in epigenetic histone marks in lineage-specific genes throughout in vitro hepatocyte differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Active acetylation and methylation marks at promoters and enhancers correlated with progressive changes in gene expression. However, repression-associated H3K27me3 marks at these control regions showed an inverse correlation with gene repression during transition from hepatic endoderm to a hepatocyte-like state. Inhibitor of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) reduced H3K27me3 decoration but did not improve hepatocyte maturation. Thus, H3K27me3 at regulatory regions does not regulate transcription and appears dispensable for hepatocyte lineage differentiation of hESCs in vitro.

Abstract: Activation of NF-κB signaling plays pivotal roles in innate immune responses against pathogens. It requires strict control to avert inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying this tight regulation are not completely understood. Here, we identified LRRC14, a novel member of LRR (leucine-rich repeat) protein family, as a negative regulator in TLR signaling. Expression of LRRC14 resulted in decreased activation of NF-κB, whereas knockdown of LRRC14 enhanced NF-κB activation as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, LRRC14 bound to HLH domain of IKKβ to block its interaction with NEMO and thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ and NF-κB activation. In addition, our data showed that TLR signaling led to lower expression of LRRC14. Together, LRRC14 may function as a checkpoint to prevent overzealous inflammation.

Abstract: Homeodomain gene Distal-less-3 (DLX3) plays an essential role in the development of bones. Mutations of DLX3 are closely associated with Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome featured with increased bone formation. However, the mechanism regarding whether DLX3 regulates osteoclastogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we firstly examined the expression of DLX3 mounting during osteoclastic differentiation process, and then established stably expressing wild type DLX3 (WT-DLX3), a novel mutant DLX3 (Q178R) found in our laboratory recently (MT-DLX3) and Dlx3 knockdown cell lines (Dlx3-shRNA) in Raw 264.7 cells using corresponding lentiviruses. Next, we investigated the influence of DLX3 on these stable cells in the process of osteoclastogenesis. The results showed that the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes as well as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were lower in WT-DLX3 and MT-DLX3, but higher in Dlx3-shRNA compared with control cells. Besides, the microRNA-124 expression was higher in WT-DLX3 and MT-DLX3 but lower in Dlx3-shRNA. Moreover, the microRNA-124 expression level positively correlated with DLX3, negatively with osteoclastogenesis-related gene NFATc1. Our results indicate that DLX3 negatively regulates osteoclastic differentiation through microRNA-124, which is partially responsible for the increased bone density in TDO patient. DLX3 may be exploited for osteoclastogenesis regulator and potential therapeutic target of osteoporosis in future.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can efficiently differentiate into the three germ layers similar to those formed by differentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This provides a new source of cells in which to establish preclinical allogeneic transplantation models. Our iPS cells were generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transfected with the Yamanaka factors, the four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc), without antibiotic selection or MEF feeders. After the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), iPS cells spontaneously differentiated into Flk1-positive cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific markers such as alpha sarcomeric actinin (α-actinin), cardiac alpha myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and connexin 43 (CX43), as well as cardiac transcription factors Nk2 homebox 5 (Nkx2.5) and gata binding protein 4 (gata4). The electrophysiological activity of iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) was detected in beating cell clusters with optical mapping and RH237 a voltage-sensitive dye, and in single contracting cells with patch-clamp technology. Incompletely differentiated iPS cells formed teratomas when transplanted into a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of myocardial infarction. Our results show that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, which in turn spontaneously differentiate into electrophysiologically functional mature cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific makers, and that these cells can potentially be used to repair myocardial infarction (MI) in the future.

Abstract: The vertebrate retina is remarkably conserved in evolution. Its relative simplicity and well-defined architecture make it particularly suitable for developmental and functional analysis of neuronal networks in the vertebrate central nervous system. The zebrafish model is at the forefront of these studies. It makes it possible to apply a wide variety of parallel embryological, genetic, and imaging tools to study the eye. Here we discuss experimental approaches that range from cell lineage analysis to the imaging of synaptic calcium currents and atomic force microscopy. These methods are currently used in zebrafish to model morphogenetic events during early development of the eye primordium, cell fate decisions during retinal neurogenesis, and the differentiation and function of the many fine structural features that underlie the detection and processing of light stimuli in the eye.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) can severely disrupt lung function, leading to fatal consequences. Salidroside is a principal active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea and has recently been reported to protect against lung injures. The present study was aimed at exploring its therapeutic effects on PF. Lung fibrotic injuries were induced in SD rats by a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg bleomycin (BLM). Then, these rats were administrated with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg salidroside for 28 days. BLM-triggered structure distortion, collagen overproduction, excessive inflammatory infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress damages in lung tissues were attenuated by salidroside in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, salidroside was noted to inhibit IκBα phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 nuclear accumulation while activating Nrf2-antioxidant signaling in BLM-treated lungs. Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) indicated an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like shift in BLM-treated lungs. These changes were suppressed by salidroside. The expression of TGF-β1 and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, Smad-2/-3, were enhanced by BLM, but weakened by salidroside. Additionally, salidroside was capable of reversing the recombinant TGF-β1-induced EMT-like changes in alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. Our study reveals that salidroside’s protective effects against fibrotic lung injuries are correlated to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antifibrotic properties.

Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa) ClpB-C (OsClpB-C) protein is expressed upon heat stress in vegetative tissues and constitutively in seeds. We produced stably transformed Arabidopsis plants carrying β-glucuronidase (Gus) reporter gene downstream to 1-kb OsClpB-C promoter (1kbPro plants). In the 1kbPro plants, expression of Gus transcript and protein followed the expression pattern of OsClpB-C gene in rice plants, i.e., heat induced in vegetative tissues and constitutive in seeds. Next, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing Gus downstream to 862-bp fragment of OsClpB-C promoter [lacking 138 nucleotides from 3′ end of the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR); ∆UTR plants). In ∆UTR plants, Gus transcript was expressed in heat-inducible manner, but strikingly, Gus protein levels were negligible after heat treatment. However, Gus protein was expressed in ∆UTR seedlings at levels comparable to 1kbPro seedlings when recovery treatment of 22 °C/2 h was given post heat stress (38 °C/15 min). This suggests that 5′UTR of OsClpB-C gene is involved in its post-transcriptional regulation and is an obligate requirement for protein expression during persistent heat stress. Furthermore, the Gus transcript levels were higher in the polysomal RNA fraction in heat-stressed seedlings of 1kbPro plants as compared to ∆UTR plants, indicating that 5′UTR aids in assembly of ribosomes onto the Gus transcript during heat stress. Unlike the case of seedlings, Gus protein was formed constitutively in ∆UTR seeds at levels comparable to 1kbPro seeds. Hence, the function of 5′UTR of OsClpB-C is dispensable for expression in seeds.

Abstract: Summary
Humans occasionally transmit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) to captive primates, who reciprocally harbor alphaherpesviruses poised for zoonotic transmission to humans. To understand the basis for the species-specific restriction of HSV-1 in primates, we simulated what might happen during the cross-species transmission of HSV-1 and found that the DNA repair protein Nbs1 from only some primate species is able to promote HSV-1 infection. The Nbs1 homologs that promote HSV-1 infection also interact with the HSV-1 ICP0 protein. ICP0 interaction mapped to a region of structural disorder in the Nbs1 protein. Chimeras reversing patterns of disorder in Nbs1 reversed titers of HSV-1 produced in the cell. By extending this analysis to 1,237 virus-interacting mammalian proteins, we show that proteins that interact with viruses are highly enriched in disorder, suggesting that viruses commonly interact with host proteins through intrinsically disordered domains.

Abstract: Summary
S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous transnitrosation donor involved in S-nitrosation of a variety of cellular proteins, thereby regulating diverse protein functions. Quantitative proteomic methods are necessary to establish which cysteine residues are most sensitive to GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Here, a competitive cysteine-reactivity profiling strategy was implemented to quantitatively measure the sensitivity of >600 cysteine residues to transnitrosation by GSNO. This platform identified a subset of cysteine residues with a high propensity for GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Functional characterization of previously unannotated S-nitrosation sites revealed that S-nitrosation of a cysteine residue distal to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2) active site impaired catalytic activity. Similarly, S-nitrosation of a non-catalytic cysteine residue in the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin D (CTSD) inhibited proteolytic activation. Together, these studies revealed two previously uncharacterized cysteine residues that regulate protein function, and established a chemical-proteomic platform with capabilities to determine substrate specificity of other cellular transnitrosation agents.

Abstract: Because of cellular senescence/apoptosis, no effective culture systems are available to maintain replication of cells from odontogenic tumors especially for odontoma, and, thus, the ability to isolate human odontoma-derived cells (hODCs) for functional studies is needed. The current study was undertaken to develop an approach to isolate hODCs and fully characterize the cells in vitro. The hODCs were cultured successfully with a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) for an extended period with stabilized lengths of the telomeres to sustain a similar phenotype/property as the primary tumoral cells. While the hODCs showed stable long-term expansion with expression of major dental epithelial markers including dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) even in the three-dimensional microenvironment, they lack the specific markers for the characteristics of stem cells. Moreover, cells from dental pulp showed significant up-regulation of DSPP when co-cultured with the hODCs, while control fibroblasts with the hODCs did not. Taken together, we propose that the hODCs can be isolated and expanded over the long term with Y-27632 to investigate not only the development of the hODCs but also other types of benign human tumors.

Abstract: Previous studies showed nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) can ablate solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but its effect on cell membrane is not fully understood. We hypothesized nsPEF disrupt the microdomains on outer-cellular membrane with direct mechanical force and as a result the plasma membrane permeability increases to facilitate the small molecule intake. Three HCC cells were pulsed one pulse per minute, an interval longer than nanopore resealing time. The cationized ferritin was used to mark up the electronegative microdomains, propidium iodide (PI) for membrane permeabilization, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the negative cell surface charge and cisplatin for inner-cellular cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that the ferritin marked-microdomain and negative cell surface charge were disrupted by nsPEF caused-mechanical force. The cell uptake of propidium and cytotoxicity of DNA-targeted cisplatin increased with a dose effect. Cisplatin gains its maximum inner-cellular cytotoxicity when combining with nsPEF stimulation. We conclude that nsPEF disrupt the microdomains on the outer cellular membrane directly and increase the membrane permeabilization for PI and cisplatin. The microdomain disruption and membrane infiltration changes are caused by the mechanical force from the changes of negative cell surface charge.

Abstract: Methods to label cell populations selectively or to modify their gene expression are critical tools in the study of developmental or physiological processes in vivo. A variety of approaches have been applied to the zebrafish model, capitalizing on Tol2 transposition to generate transgenic lines with high efficiency. Here we describe the adoption of the Q system of Neurospora crassa, which includes the QF transcription factor and the upstream activating sequence (QUAS) to which it binds. These components function as a bipartite regulatory system similar to that of yeast Gal4/UAS, producing robust expression in transient assays of zebrafish embryos injected with plasmids and in stable transgenic lines. An important advantage, however, is that QUAS-regulated transgenes appear far less susceptible to transcriptional silencing even after seven generations. This chapter describes some of the Q system reagents that have been developed for zebrafish, as well as the use of the QF transcription factor for isolation of tissue-specific driver lines from gene/enhancer trap screens. Additional strategies successfully implemented in invertebrate models, such as a truncated QF transcription factor (QF2) or the reassembly of a split QF, are also discussed. The provided information, and available Gateway-based vectors, should enable those working with the zebrafish model to implement the Q system with minimal effort or to use it in combination with Gal4, Cre, or other regulatory systems for further refinement of transcriptional control.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) causes acute enteropathy resolving after 4–7 days. Strikingly, antibiotic therapy does not accelerate disease resolution. We screened for factors blocking remission using a S.Tm enterocolitis model. The antibiotic ciprofloxacin clears pathogen stool loads within 3–24 hr, while gut pathology resolves more slowly (ψ50: ∼48 hr, remission: 6–9 days). This delayed resolution is mediated by an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent response that is triggered during acute infection and continues throughout therapy. Specifically, IFN-γ production by mucosal T and NK cells retards disease resolution by maintaining signaling through the transcriptional regulator STAT1 and boosting expression of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β, TNF, and iNOS. Additionally, sustained IFN-γ fosters phagocyte accumulation and hampers antimicrobial defense mediated by IL-22 and the lectin REGIIIβ. These findings reveal a role for IFN-γ in delaying resolution of intestinal inflammation and may inform therapies for acute Salmonella enteropathy, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, or disease resolution during antibiotic treatment.

Abstract: Progress on the study of the molecular and cellular biology of septins would be greatly accelerated by the development of small molecules that directly inhibit higher-order septin assembly in vivo. By comparison, molecules like latrunculin, paclitaxil, benomyl, etc. allow researchers to acutely perturb the actin or tubulin cytoskeletal networks. Two small molecules, forchlorfenuron (FCF; N-(2-chloro-4pyridyl)-N-phenylurea) and 1-ethyl-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-methylpyrimido[5,4-e][1,2,4]triazine-5,7-dione (PubChem CID 906558), have documented effects on septin localization and/or function, although for each molecule there is also strong evidence for off-target effects. In this chapter we provide a summary of ways to utilize FCF to alter higher-order septin assembly properties in living cells.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells is regulated by the blood glucose concentration and occurs through Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. The activities of multiple ion channels in the β cell plasma membrane are required to fine-tune insulin secretion in order to maintain normoglycemia. Phosphoinositide lipids in the plasma membrane often gate ion channels, and variations in the concentration of these lipids affect ion-channel open probability and conductance. Using light-regulated synthesis or depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2), we found that this lipid positively regulated both depolarization- and glucose-triggered Ca2+ influx in a dose-dependent manner. Small reductions of PI(4,5)P2 caused by brief illumination resulted in partial suppression of Ca2+ influx that followed the kinetics of the lipid, whereas depletion resulted in marked inhibition of both Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion.

Abstract: The accessibility of the lateral line system and its amenability to long-term in vivo imaging transformed the developing lateral line into a powerful model system to study fundamental morphogenetic events, such as guided migration, proliferation, cell shape changes, organ formation, organ deposition, cell specification and differentiation. In addition, the lateral line is not only amenable to live imaging during migration stages but also during postembryonic events such as sensory organ tissue homeostasis and regeneration. The robust regenerative capabilities of the mature, mechanosensory lateral line hair cells, which are homologous to inner ear hair cells and the ease with which they can be imaged, have brought zebrafish into the spotlight as a model to develop tools to treat human deafness. In this chapter, we describe protocols for long-term in vivo confocal imaging of the developing and regenerating lateral line.

Abstract: Lipids serve essential functions in cells as signaling molecules, membrane components, and sources of energy. Defects in lipid metabolism are implicated in a number of pandemic human diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia. Many aspects of how fatty acids and cholesterol are absorbed and processed by intestinal cells remain unclear and present a hurdle to developing approaches for disease prevention and treatment. Numerous studies have shown that the zebrafish is an excellent model for vertebrate lipid metabolism. In this chapter, we review commercially available fluorescent lipids that can be deployed in live zebrafish to better understand lipid signaling and metabolism. In this chapter, we present criteria one should consider when selecting specific fluorescent lipids for the study of digestive physiology or lipid metabolism in larval zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
Concealing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a principal strategy used by fungi to avoid immune recognition. Surface exposure of PAMPs during germination can leave the pathogen vulnerable. Accordingly, β-glucan surface exposure during Aspergillus fumigatus germination activates an Atg5-dependent autophagy pathway termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which promotes fungal killing. We found that LAP activation also requires the genetic, biochemical or biological (germination) removal of A. fumigatus cell wall melanin. The attenuated virulence of melanin-deficient A. fumigatus is restored in Atg5-deficient macrophages and in mice upon conditional inactivation of Atg5 in hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, Aspergillus melanin inhibits NADPH oxidase-dependent activation of LAP by excluding the p22phox subunit from the phagosome. Thus, two events that occur concomitantly during germination of airborne fungi, surface exposure of PAMPs and melanin removal, are necessary for LAP activation and fungal killing. LAP blockade is a general property of melanin pigments, a finding with broad physiological implications.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis-factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF-superfamily that selectively induces apoptosis through death receptors (DRs) 4 and/ or DR5 in cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. Unfortunately, many clinical studies have shown that cancer cells acquire TRAIL-resistance and thus avoid TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In the current study, we newly found that PTBP1, a splicer protein that plays an important role in energy metabolism is highly expressed in TRAIL-resistant human colon cancer DLD-1. Interestingly, silencing PTBP1 by using siRNA for PTBP1 (siR-PTBP1) resulted in a significant increase in TRAIL-sensitivity along with the switching of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1, leading to impaired Warburg effect, because the intracellular ATP levels were significantly increased and the production of lactate decreased. Notably, siR-PTBP1 canceled the resistance by increasing the expression level of DR5 and effectively inducing the translocation of DR5 to the cell surface membrane. Also, siR-PTBP1 up-regulated the expression level of CCN1, which contributed to the enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that silencing PTBP1, thus impairing the Warburg effect positively affected TRAIL-induced apoptosis and that this splicer protein may thus serve as a possible target molecule to cancel the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL.

Abstract: Tumor infiltrating monocytes play a crucial role in tumor immune surveillance. As lactate is an important component of the tumor milieu, we investigated its role in the transcriptional regulation of MHC I which is crucial for mounting effective immune responses against tumors. Lactate elevated MHC class I expression in monocytes. Increase in HLAB expression was concomitant with increase in HIF-1α and decrease in PRMT1 levels. Interestingly, a reciprocal relationship was observed between PRMT1 and HIF-1α. While HIF-1α inhibition decreased lactate induced MHC I, both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of PRMT1 upregulated HLAB levels. PRMT1 over-expression rescued lactate mediated increase in MHC I expression. Lactate mediated changes in nucleosomal occupancy on HLAB promoter facilitated a chromatin landscape that favoured decreased recruitment of CREB and PRMT1 on CRE site of HLAB locus. The effect of lactate on the chromatin landscape of HLAB was completely mimicked by PRMT1 inhibitor AMI-1 in terms of nucleosomal occupancy and CREB recruitment. Besides demonstrating the importance of lactate in the transcriptional regulation of HLAB, this study highlights for the first time the (i) existence of HIF-1α-PRMT1 regulatory loop and (ii) role of PRMT1 in modulating chromatin landscape crucial for facilitating HLAB gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Preventing transmission is an important element of malaria control. However, most of the current available methods to assay for malaria transmission blocking are relatively low throughput and cannot be applied to large chemical libraries. We have developed a high-throughput and cost-effective assay, the Saponin-lysis Sexual Stage Assay (SaLSSA), for identifying small molecules with transmission-blocking capacity. SaLSSA analysis of 13,983 unique compounds uncovered that >90% of well-characterized antimalarials, including endoperoxides and 4-aminoquinolines, as well as compounds active against asexual blood stages, lost most of their killing activity when parasites developed into metabolically quiescent stage V gametocytes. On the other hand, we identified compounds with consistent low nanomolar transmission-blocking activity, some of which showed cross-reactivity against asexual blood and liver stages. The data clearly emphasize substantial physiological differences between sexual and asexual parasites and provide a tool and starting points for the discovery and development of transmission-blocking drugs.

The Yersinia Virulence Factor YopM Hijacks Host Kinases to Inhibit Type III Effector-Triggered Activation of the Pyrin Inflammasome,

Abstract: Summary
Pathogenic Yersinia, including Y. pestis, the agent of plague in humans, and Y. pseudotuberculosis, the related enteric pathogen, deliver virulence effectors into host cells via a prototypical type III secretion system to promote pathogenesis. These effectors, termed Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), modulate multiple host signaling responses. Studies in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis have shown that YopM suppresses infection-induced inflammasome activation; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that YopM specifically restricts the pyrin inflammasome, which is triggered by the RhoA-inactivating enzymatic activities of YopE and YopT, in Y. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. The attenuation of a yopM mutant is fully reversed in pyrin knockout mice, demonstrating that YopM inhibits pyrin to promote virulence. Mechanistically, YopM recruits and activates the host kinases PRK1 and PRK2 to negatively regulate pyrin by phosphorylation. These results show how a virulence factor can hijack host kinases to inhibit effector-triggered pyrin inflammasome activation.

Abstract: Summary
MCPIP1 is a recently identified immune regulator that plays critical roles in preventing immune disorders, and is also present in the brain. Currently an unresolved question remains as to how MCPIP1 performs its non-immune functions in normal brain development. Here, we report that MCPIP1 is abundant in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and newborn neurons during the early stages of neurogenesis. The suppression of MCPIP1 expression impairs normal neuronal differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and concomitant NPC proliferation. MCPIP1 is important for maintenance of the NPC pool. Notably, we demonstrate that MCPIP1 reduces TET (TET1/TET2/TET3) levels and then decreases 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels. Furthermore, the MCPIP1 interaction with TETs is involved in neurogenesis and in establishing the proper number of NPCs in vivo. Collectively, our findings not only demonstrate that MCPIP1 plays an important role in early cortical neurogenesis but also reveal an unexpected link between neocortical development, immune regulators, and epigenetic modification.

Role of OATP2A1 in PGE2 secretion from human colorectal cancer cells via exocytosis in response to oxidative stress,

Abstract: Chronic inflammation induced by reactive oxygen species is associated with increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which serves as a key mediator of inflammatory responses, plays an important role in CRC initiation and progression. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of prostaglandin transporter OATP2A1/SLCO2A1 in the changes of PGE2 disposition in CRC cells in response to oxidative stress. H2O2 induced translocation of cytoplasmic OATP2A1 to plasma membranes in LoVo and COLO 320DM cells, but not in Caco-2 cells. The shift of subcellular OATP2A1 was abolished in the presence of anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine or an inhibitor of protein kinase C, which evokes exocytosis. Exposure of LoVo cells to H2O2 caused an increase in the amount of extracellular PGE2 without changing the sum of intra- and extracellular PGE2. OATP2A1 knockdown decreased extracellular PGE2 in LoVo cells. In addition, extracellular PGE2 was significantly reduced by exocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D, suggesting that H2O2-induced PGE2 release occurs in an exocytotic manner. Furthermore, mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly reduced in LoVo cells by knockdown of OATP2A1. These results suggest that cytoplasmic OATP2A1 likely facilitates PGE2 loading into suitable intracellular compartment(s) for efficient exocytotic PGE2 release from CRC cells exposed to oxidative stress.

Abstract: Unraveling the structural organization of neurons can provide fundamental insights into brain function. However, visualizing neurite morphology in vivo remains difficult due to the high density and complexity of neural packing in the nervous system. Detailed analysis of neural morphology requires distinction of closely neighboring, highly intricate cellular structures such as neurites with high contrast. Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins have become powerful tools to optically highlight molecular and cellular structures for developmental and cell biological studies. Yet, selective labeling of single cells of interest in vivo has been precluded due to inefficient photoconversion when using high intensity, pulsed, near-infrared laser sources that are commonly applied for achieving axially confined two-photon (2P) fluorescence excitation. Here we describe a novel optical mechanism, “confined primed conversion,” which employs continuous dual-wave illumination to achieve confined green-to-red photoconversion of single cells in live zebrafish embryos. Confined primed conversion exhibits wide applicability and this chapter specifically elaborates on employing this imaging modality to analyze neural morphology of optically targeted single neurons in the developing zebrafish brain.

Abstract: Previous studies suggest that early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) plays an important role in hypoxia-induced drug-resistance. However, the mechanism still remains to be clarified. Herein, we investigated the role of Egr-1 in hypoxia-induced autophagy and its resulted hypoxia-driven chemo-resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cells. Our data demonstrated that Egr-1 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cells and conferred them drug resistance under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Egr-1 transcriptionally regulated hypoxia-induced autophagy by binding to LC3 promoter in HCC cells, which resulted in resistance of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents; while dominant negative Egr-1 could inhibit autophagy level, and thus enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that hypoxia-induced Egr-1 expression enhanced drug resistance of HCC cells likely through autophagy. Accordingly, it is suggested that a mechanism of hypoxia/Egr-1/autophagy axis might be involved in drug resistance in HCC.

Abstract: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a unique model organism at the functional intersection between a high fecundity and conserved vertebrate physiology while being amenable to a multitude of genome editing techniques. The genome engineering field has experienced an unprecedented rate of growth in the recent years since the introduction of designer endonucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats–Cas9 systems. With the ever-evolving toolset available to the scientific community, the important question one should ask is not simply how to make a mutant line, but rather how best to do so. For this purpose, understanding the toolset is just one end of the equation; understanding how DNA is repaired once double-strand breaks are induced by designer endonucleases, as well as understanding proper fish handling and line maintenance techniques, are also essential to rapidly edit the zebrafish genome. This chapter is outlined to provide a bird's-eye view on each of these three components. The goal of this chapter is to facilitate the adoption of the zebrafish as a model to study human genetic disease and to rapidly analyze the function of the vertebrate genome.
